[START_SECTION]Preface
A.T.R. Sheffield, E.L. London and A.J.K.O. Cambridge
We are grateful to the publishers, Elsevier, for the invitation to produce a
fourth edition of the Pocketbook of Differential Diagnosis. The text has been
updated and some further conditions added. We have been pleased by
the comments from our readership, who have suggested additions and
corrections, and these have been taken into account when writing this
new edition. The introduction of the colour coding system in the third
edition was favourably received and has been retained in this edition,
with a few modifications in the grading of the relative frequency of
some conditions. A number of our readers felt that the addition of
illustrations would be helpful and to that end, we have added these to
some of the chapters where we thought it appropriate. Readers and
reviewers also suggested that the addition of management of diseases
would be helpful but this book is a manual of differential diagnosis;
treatment of the various conditions is outside the scope of this book.
We are pleased with the way that previous editions have sold and that,
in these days of self-directed problem-based learning, medical students
still see the need for a book offering a didactic approach. Indeed, we
believe that the book will be particularly helpful to those on problembased learning courses. We hope this book will continue to help you on
the wards and in the clinics – and in examinations!

[START_SECTION]How to Use This Book
This book has been written in three sections: Clinical Presentations,
Biochemical Presentations and Haematological Presentations.
In the Clinical Presentations section (Section A), we have attempted to
indicate the relative frequency of the conditions causing the various
symptoms and signs by colour coding them in green, orange and red,
according to whether they are considered common, occasional or rare,
respectively.
• A common cause of the symptom or sign
• Might occasionally give rise to the symptom or sign
• Will only rarely cause the symptom or sign
This has been no easy task (and indeed in the Biochemical
Presentations and Haematological Presentations sections, we found it so
difficult that we abandoned it) but we hope that it will indicate to
readers whether they are dealing with a common, occasional or rare
disorder. It is appreciated that some conditions may be common in the
UK and rare in other parts of the world (and vice versa). Where this is
the case, the appropriate colour coding is indicated in brackets, e.g.
Campylobacter is a common cause of diarrhoea in the UK and therefore
coded green but rare in tropical Africa and therefore coded red and in
brackets. We have tried to indicate the importance of the condition, not
only in causing a particular symptom or sign, but also in its overall
incidence, e.g. diverticular disease is a common condition and is a
common cause of pain in the left iliac fossa and is therefore coded green.
It is only an occasional cause of large bowel obstruction and in this
context, is coded orange.
At the end of each chapter, the reader will find a box containing either
what we consider to be important learning points, or indicating

[START_SECTION]symptoms and signs suggestive of significant pathology that require
urgent action.

[START_SECTION]Abdominal Pain
Abdominal pain is an extremely common presenting symptom. The pain
may be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (lasting for more than a few days
or presenting intermittently). It is important to be able to distinguish
causes of abdominal pain which need urgent surgery, e.g. ruptured
aortic aneurysm, perforated diverticular disease, from those that do not,
e.g. biliary colic, ureteric colic, acute pancreatitis. The causes of
abdominal pain are legion and the list below contains some of the more
common causes but is not intended to be comprehensive.

History
Age
Certain conditions are more likely to occur in certain age groups, e.g.
mesenteric adenitis in children, diverticular disease in the elderly.

Pain
■ Time and mode of onset, e.g. sudden, gradual.
■ Character, e.g. dull, vague, cramping, sharp, burning.

[START_SECTION]■ Severity.
■ Constancy, e.g. continuous (peritonitis); intermittent (pain of intestinal
colic).
■ Location: where did it start? Has it moved?
■ Radiation, e.g. loin to groin in ureteric colic.
■ Effect of respiration, movement, food, defecation, micturition and
menstruation.
■ Vomiting.
■ Did vomiting precede the pain?
■ Frequency.
■ Character, e.g. bile, faeculent, blood, coffee grounds.

Defecation
■ Constipation: absolute constipation with colicky abdominal pain,
distension and vomiting suggests intestinal obstruction.
■ Diarrhoea: frequency, consistency of stools, blood, mucus, pus.

Fever
■ Any rigors.

Past history
■ Previous surgery, e.g. adhesions may cause intestinal obstruction.
■ Recent trauma, e.g. delayed rupture of spleen.
■ Menstrual history, e.g. ectopic pregnancy.

Examination
General
Is the patient lying comfortably? Is the patient lying still but in pain, e.g.
peritonitis? Is the patient writhing in agony, e.g. ureteric or biliary colic?
Is the patient flushed, suggesting pyrexia?

Pulse and temperature are raised in inflammatory conditions. They may
also be raised with impending infarction of bowel. An increased
respiratory rate might suggest chest infection referring pain to the
abdomen.

Cervical lymphadenopathy
Associated with mesenteric adenitis.

Chest
Referred pain from lobar pneumonia.

Abdomen
■ Inspection. Does the abdomen move on respiration? Look for scars,
distension, visible peristalsis (usually due to chronic obstruction in
patient with very thin abdominal wall). Check the hernial orifices. Are
there any obvious masses, e.g. visible, pulsatile mass to suggest aortic
aneurysm?
■ Palpation. The patient should be relaxed, lying flat, with arms by side.
Be gentle and start as far from the painful site as possible. Check for
guarding and rigidity. Check for masses, e.g. appendix mass, pulsatile
expansile mass to suggest aortic aneurysm. Carefully examine the
hernial orifices. Examine the testes to exclude torsion.
■ Percussion, e.g. tympanitic note with distension with intestinal
obstruction; dullness over bladder due to acute retention.
■ Auscultation. Take your time (30–60 s); e.g. silent abdomen of
peritonitis; high-pitched tinkling bowel sounds of intestinal obstruction.

Rectal examination
Always carry out a rectal examination.

[START_SECTION]Vaginal examination
There may be discharge or tenderness associated with pelvic
inflammatory disease. Examine the uterus and adnexa, e.g. pregnancy,
fibroids, ectopic pregnancy.

[START_SECTION]Abdominal Swellings
Abdominal swellings may be divided into generalised and localised
swellings. Abdominal swellings are a common surgical problem. They
are also frequently the subject of examination questions! Generalised
swellings are classically described as the ‘five Fs’, namely fat, faeces,
flatus, fluid or fetus. For the purpose of description of localised
swellings, the abdomen has been divided into seven areas, i.e. right
upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, epigastrium, umbilical, right lower
abdomen, left lower abdomen and suprapubic area. Hepatomegaly,
splenomegaly and renal masses, although referred to in this section, are
dealt with under the relevant heading in the appropriate section of the
book.

FIGURE 2 Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
Both kidneys are greatly enlarged by numerous cysts of various sizes.

History
Liver
See hepatomegaly, p. 229.

[START_SECTION]Gall bladder
Known history of gallstones. History of flatulent dyspepsia. Jaundice.
Dark urine. Pale stools. Pruritus. Recent weight loss may suggest
carcinoma of the head of the pancreas or carcinoma of the gall bladder.

Right colon
Lassitude, weakness, lethargy suggesting anaemia from chronic blood
loss. Central abdominal colicky pain, vomiting and constipation and
change in bowel habit will suggest colonic carcinoma. There may be a
history of gross constipation to suggest faecal loading. Known history of
diverticular disease. History of attacks of crying, abdominal pain and
blood and mucus in the stool (‘redcurrant jelly’ stool) will suggest
intussusception in infants.

Right kidney
See kidney swellings, p. 299.

Examination
Liver
See p. 229.

Gall bladder
A mucocele is either non-tender or only mildly tender. It is large and
smooth and moves with respiration, projecting from under the ninth
costal cartilage at the lateral border of rectus abdominis. Empyema
presents with an acutely tender gall bladder, which is difficult to define
due to pain and tenderness. The patient may be jaundiced due to Mirizzi
syndrome (external pressure from a stone impacted in Hartmann’s
pouch on the adjacent bile duct). Carcinoma of the gall bladder may
present as a hard, irregular mass in the right hypochondrium, but

[START_SECTION]normally presents as obstructive jaundice due to secondary deposits in
the nodes at the porta hepatis causing external compression of the
hepatic ducts. A smooth enlarged gall bladder in the presence of
jaundice may be due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas
(Courvoisier’s law: ‘in the presence of obstructive jaundice, if the gall
bladder is palpable, the cause is unlikely to be due to gallstones’).

Right colon
Faeces are usually soft and putty-like and can be indented but may also
feel like a mass of rocks. Carcinoma is usually a firm to hard irregular
mass, which may be mobile or fixed. A diverticular mass is usually
tender and ill-defined, unless there is a large paracolic abscess. With
caecal volvulus, there is a tympanitic mass which may be tender with
impending infarction. With intussusception, there will be a smooth,
mobile tender sausage-shaped mass in the right hypochondrium. The
mass may move as the intussusception progresses.

Right kidney
See kidney swellings, p. 299.

History
Spleen
See splenomegaly, p. 425.

Stomach
Vomiting will suggest pyloric stenosis, acute dilatation of the stomach
and carcinoma. Vomiting food ingested several days previously
suggests pyloric stenosis. Lethargy, loss of appetite and weight loss are
seen in carcinoma of the stomach.

Pancreas
There may be a history of acute pancreatitis, which would suggest the
development of a pseudocyst. Weight loss, backache and jaundice will
suggest carcinoma of the pancreas. Recent onset of diabetes may occur
with carcinoma of the pancreas.

Kidney
See kidney swellings, p. 299.

Colon
Lower abdominal colicky pain and change in bowel habit may suggest
carcinoma or diverticular disease. A long history of constipation may

[START_SECTION]suggest faecal masses.

Examination
Stomach
Gastric distension may present with a vague fullness and a succussion
splash. Carcinoma will present with a hard, craggy, immobile mass.
Pancreatic tumours may be impalpable or present as a fixed mass,
which does not move with respiration. Pancreatic pseudocysts are often
large, smooth and may be tender.

Epigastrium
Many of the swellings that occur here will have been described under
swellings in other regions of the abdomen. Although a full list of
epigastric swellings is given below, only those not referred to in other
sections will be discussed in the history and examination sections.

Causes
Abdominal Wall
• Lipoma
• Epigastric hernia
• Xiphisternum
• Metastatic deposits

Stomach
• Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
• Carcinoma
• Acute gastric volvulus

Pancreas
See left upper quadrant, p. 13.

Transverse Colon

[START_SECTION]• Carcinoma
• Faeces
• Diverticular mass

Liver
See hepatomegaly, p. 229.

Retroperitoneum
• Aortic aneurysm
• Lymphadenopathy (lymphoma, secondaries from testicular
carcinoma)

Omentum
• Omental secondaries, e.g. stomach and ovary

History
Abdominal wall
The patient may indicate a soft, subcutaneous swelling, which may be a
lipoma or an epigastric hernia containing extraperitoneal fat. The latter
always occurs in the midline through a defect in the linea alba. They
may become strangulated, in which case they are tender, and
occasionally the skin is red. Occasionally a patient may indicate a firm
bony lump in the upper epigastrium, which is in fact a normal
xiphisternum. This may have become apparent due to either a deliberate
attempt to lose weight or sudden weight loss as a result of underlying
disease. Metastatic deposits may present as single or multiple fixed
lumps in the skin or subcutaneous tissue, e.g. from breast or bronchus.

Stomach
A baby may present with projectile vomiting. The infant thrives for the
first 3–4 weeks of life and then develops projectile vomiting after feeds.

[START_SECTION]The first-born male child in a family is most commonly affected. There
may be a history of a familial tendency, especially on the maternal side.

Retroperitoneum
A history of backache may suggest an aortic aneurysm or the patient
may complain of a pulsatile epigastric swelling. Backache may also be a
presenting symptom of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

Examination
Abdominal wall
A soft, lobulated mass suggests a lipoma. It will be mobile over the
tensed abdominal musculature. A fatty, occasionally tender, non-mobile
swelling in the midline will suggest an epigastric hernia. The majority
of epigastric hernias are composed of extraperitoneal fat, although there
may be a sac with bowel contents. A cough impulse will be palpable.
The swelling may be reducible. Hard, irregular, fixed lumps in the
abdominal wall suggest metastatic deposits, especially if there is a
history of carcinoma of the breast or bronchus.

Retroperitoneum
An aneurysm presents as a pulsatile expansile mass. Check the distal
circulation (emboli, associated peripheral ischaemia). Retroperitoneal
lymph node metastases from testicular cancer may present as a large
retroperitoneal mass. Check the testes for swellings. Check all other
sites for lymphadenopathy (especially the left supraclavicular node).
Lymphadenopathy may also result from lymphoma. Check for
lymphadenopathy elsewhere and for splenomegaly. A hard, craggy,
mobile mass, especially in the presence of ascites, suggests omental
secondaries (ovary, stomach – check for Virchow’s node, i.e. left
supraclavicular node).

History

[START_SECTION]Superficial
Sister Joseph’s nodule presents as a hard lump at the umbilicus. It is due
to secondary deposits of carcinoma of the stomach, colon, ovary or
breast.

Hernia
An umbilical hernia presents in infancy as an umbilical swelling which
is reducible, and will usually have been noted at birth. Paraumbilical
hernias usually occur in obese adults, often female. The patient may
have had a lump for a long time. It may present with incarceration or
with a tender painful swelling, suggesting strangulation.

Small bowel
The patient may present with central abdominal colicky pain, vomiting
and diarrhoea, suggestive of Crohn’s disease or more rarely a carcinoma
of the small bowel.

Examination
Superficial
Sister Joseph’s nodule presents as a hard lump or lumps at the umbilicus.
Check for carcinoma of the stomach, colon, ovary or breast.

Hernia
In infants, there may be an obvious large umbilical defect. The swelling
is usually wide-necked and reducible. In adults, there may be a reducible
paraumbilical hernia. Occasionally it is soft, containing extraperitoneal
fat. Frequently, there is a sac containing omentum. Incarceration may
occur. A tender red swelling suggests strangulation. A Richter’s-type
hernia may occur at this site.

[START_SECTION]Small bowel
Small bowel masses are usually very mobile, may be sausage-shaped,
and may be tender.

Retroperitoneum
• Iliac artery aneurysm
• Lymphadenopathy
• Neoplasm of iliac bone, e.g. osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing’s
tumour

History
Anterior abdominal wall
The patient may have the development of a soft mass that is slow
growing, suggestive of a lipoma. A spigelian hernia occurs just lateral to
the rectus muscle, halfway between the umbilicus and symphysis pubis.
It is usually reducible.

Large bowel
A short history of central abdominal, colicky pain followed by a sharply
localised pain in the right iliac fossa will suggest the diagnosis of acute
appendicitis. After 48 hours, if there is not generalised peritonitis, an
appendix mass will have formed and an abscess may subsequently form
in the right iliac fossa. With carcinoma of the caecum, the patient will
either have noticed a mass or will present with alteration in bowel habit
and the symptoms of anaemia, e.g. tiredness, lethargy. The same applies

[START_SECTION]to carcinoma of the ascending colon. Faeces will be indentable and hard,
rock-like masses will be felt around the colon. Caecal volvulus will
present with central abdominal colicky pain and abdominal distension.
Intussusception is more common in infants and usually presents with
colicky abdominal pain and the classic ‘redcurrant jelly’ stool. Crohn’s
disease will present with malaise and diarrhoea with central abdominal
colicky pain.
Carcinoma of the sigmoid colon will present with lower abdominal
colicky pain, a change in bowel habit and bleeding PR. Diverticular
disease may present with similar symptoms. Sigmoid volvulus will
present with lower abdominal colicky pain and a tense, palpable mass
in the left abdomen, which is tympanitic on percussion. Large bowel
Crohn’s disease will present with a sausage-like, palpable mass, which
may be tender and is associated with diarrhoea.

Small bowel
If there is a mass palpable in the right iliac fossa, the site of pathology is
likely to be in the terminal ileum. This usually involves central
abdominal colicky pain and a change in bowel habit. Ileo-caecal TB
causes abdominal pain, diarrhoea which is associated with malaise and
weight loss.

Spleen
With massive splenomegaly, the spleen may be palpable extending into
the right lower quadrant.

Ovary/fallopian tube/uterus
The patient herself may feel a lump in the abdomen (ovarian cyst,
fibroid) or notice generalised abdominal swelling, which may be
associated with a massive ovarian cyst or ascites associated with
ovarian cancer. Ectopic pregnancy will present with a missed period
and abdominal pain, bleeding PV, and collapse with hypovolaemic

[START_SECTION]shock if it ruptures. Salpingo-oophoritis will present with lower
abdominal pain and tenderness and associated fever, and often a
purulent vaginal discharge. Menorrhagia, lower abdominal pain and
dyspareunia may suggest fibroids.

Retroperitoneum
The patient may present having noticed a pulsatile swelling in the iliac
fossa. Pelvic lymphadenopathy may be suspected by history of removal
of a malignant lesion from the lower limb, especially malignant
melanoma. There may be an existing lesion present on the limb. A dull,
boring pain may be suggestive of an iliac bone lesion. A palpable bony
lesion suggests an osteogenic sarcoma or Ewing’s tumour of bone.

Examination
The features of most of the lesions described above have been described
in the other sections on abdominal swellings. Only those findings
relevant to the ovary, uterus and fallopian tube will be described here.
Examination may reveal a greatly distended abdomen, which may be
due to a huge ovarian cyst or ascites associated with an ovarian
neoplasm. Huge ovarian cysts are often smooth and loculated. It is
impossible to get below them as they arise out of the pelvis. Signs of
ascites include shifting dullness and a fluid thrill. With ectopic
pregnancy, there may be a palpable mass in either iliac fossa. This may
be associated with shock if rupture of the ectopic pregnancy has
occurred. Shoulder-tip pain may occur from irritation of the
undersurface of the diaphragm with blood. With tubo-ovarian abscess,
there may be a palpable mass arising out of the pelvis, or merely lower
abdominal tenderness. Vaginal examination will reveal tenderness in
the pouch of Douglas. Uterine fibroids may be extremely large and
palpable as nodules on the underlying uterus.

Bladder
• Acute retention
• Chronic retention
• Carcinoma

Uterus
• Pregnancy
• Fibroids
• Carcinoma

Bowel
• Diverticular mass
• Crohn’s disease
• Carcinoma

Other
• Urachal cyst

History
Bladder
Sudden onset of suprapubic pain with inability to pass urine suggests
acute retention. There will usually be a past history of difficulty in
starting and a poor stream. A history of dribbling may suggest acute
renal failure associated with upper tract problems from chronic outflow
obstruction. Haematuria, frequency or dysuria may suggest bladder
carcinoma.

[START_SECTION]Uterus
Missed periods and early morning vomiting will suggest pregnancy.
Menorrhagia and dyspareunia will suggest fibroids. Intermenstrual
bleeding suggests carcinoma.

Urachus
Umbilical discharge may suggest a urachal cyst or abscess.

Examination
In acute retention, there will be a smooth, tender swelling extending
towards (but not above) the umbilicus. It is dull to percussion and it is
impossible to get below it. Digital rectal examination will usually reveal
benign prostatic hypertrophy or occasionally a hard, irregular prostate
associated with carcinoma. With carcinoma of the bladder, a hard,
irregular craggy mass may be felt arising out of the pelvis.

Uterus
A smooth, regular swelling arising out of the pelvis suggests a pregnant
uterus. Later, as the uterus enlarges, fetal heart sounds may be heard.
Fibroids are usually smooth and firm and may become very large.
Uterine carcinoma is hard and craggy. Bimanual examination may
confirm the diagnosis.

inflammatory cause.
• Always check the βHCG in women of childbearing age.
• A hard, craggy, mobile mass, especially in the presence of
ascites, suggests omental secondaries, e.g. ovary, stomach.
Check for Virchow’s node, i.e. in the left supraclavicular fossa.

[START_SECTION]Anorectal Pain
Anorectal pain is a common problem. The majority of patients have an
obvious cause, e.g. fissure-in-ano, perianal abscess or thrombosed
haemorrhoids.

Causes
Acute
• Fissure-in-ano
• Perianal haematoma
• Thrombosed haemorrhoids (Fig. 3)
• Perianal abscess
• Intersphincteric abscess
• Ischiorectal abscess
• Trauma
• Anorectal gonorrhoea
• Herpes

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 3 Thrombosed haemorrhoids.
Note the oedematous, congested purplish mass seen at the anal margin.

Chronic
• Fistula-in-ano
• Anorectal malignancy
• Chronic perianal sepsis, e.g. Crohn’s disease, TB
• Proctalgia fugax
• Solitary rectal ulcer
• Cauda equina lesions

History
Constipation with pain on defecation and blood (usually on the paper)
will suggest fissure-in-ano. A sudden onset of pain with a tender lump in
the perianal region will suggest perianal haematoma. A past history of
prolapsing piles, with failure to reduce them, associated with pain and
tenderness suggests thrombosed haemorrhoids. Gradual onset of pain
and tenderness with swelling is suggestive of abscess formation. A
careful history must be taken of trauma. A history of anal sexual
exposure will suggest gonorrhoea or herpes. With gonorrhoea, there
may be irritation, itching, discharge and pain. With herpes, there will be
pain and irritation. Proctalgia fugax is diagnosed on the history of

[START_SECTION]perineal pain, which is spasmodic, the spasms lasting up to 30 min. The
pain often feels deep inside the rectum. The cause is unknown but may
be related to paroxysmal contraction of levator ani. Anorectal
malignancies will be suggested in alteration of bowel habit and
bleeding on defecation. Pain will only be apparent if the tumour
involves the anal canal below the dentate line, where sensation is of the
somatic type. Solitary rectal ulcer may present with pain but more
usually presents with bleeding PR, passage of mucus and difficulty with
defecation. Chronic perianal sepsis may be the presenting symptom of
Crohn’s disease or TB. These diseases may already be manifest at other
sites of the body. Rarely lesions of the cauda equina may cause anal
pain.

Examination
Inspection may reveal a chronic fissure-in-ano, perianal haematoma,
thrombosed piles or a tumour growing out of the anal canal. A tense,
red, tender area may be present, representing a perianal abscess. A
fullness in the buttock with redness may indicate a large ischiorectal
abscess. A digital rectal examination should be carried out unless the
diagnosis is obvious. With gonococcal proctitis, proctoscopy may reveal
pus and blood in the rectal ampulla with oedematous and friable
mucosa. The presence of vesicles in the anal area will suggest herpes.
Solitary rectal ulcer is usually diagnosed on sigmoidoscopy when
redness and oedema of the mucosa is seen, usually, but not always, in
association with frank ulceration. If a cauda equina lesion is suspected, a
full neurological examination should be carried out. No abnormality is
usually found with proctalgia fugax.

places, may be a presentation of Crohn’s disease.
• Do not treat perianal abscesses with antibiotics. Perianal
abscesses should be incised and drained. Failure to do so may
result in development of a fistula-in-ano.

[START_SECTION]Arm Pain
This section deals with pain in the upper limb unrelated to joint pains.
The majority of causes of arm pain are related to either neurological or
vascular lesions. Musculoskeletal causes of arm pain are covered in the
chapter on Joint Disorders (p. 267).

Causes
Cervical Lesions
• Disc lesion (Fig. 4)
• Cervical spondylosis
• Syringomyelia
• Infection, e.g. osteitis, TB
• Tumours
• Spinal cord
• Meninges
• Nerves
• Vertebral bodies

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 4 A trans-axial image showing a right-sided acute disc bulge at
C6–C7 level, which is compressing the C7 nerve root in the exit foramen
(arrow).
The patient will experience pain in the right arm radiating into the middle
finger (dermatomal distribution of C7) and weakness of extension of the
elbow (weak triceps-myotomal distribution of C7). There will be a reduced
or absent triceps reflex.

Brachial Plexus
• Cervical rib
• Malignant infiltration, e.g. Pancoast’s tumour
• Thoracic inlet syndrome

Vascular Lesions
• Myocardial ischaemia (left arm)
• Embolism
• Axillary venous thrombosis
• Subclavian artery stenosis
• Arterial thrombosis

Others
• Repetitive strain injury
• Carpal tunnel syndrome
• Peripheral neuropathy
• Bone tumours
• Compartment syndrome

[START_SECTION]• Acute, e.g. crush injuries
• Chronic, e.g. exertional

History
Symptoms of cervical lesions include: pain and stiffness in the neck; pain
radiating down the arm. Cervical cord compression may occur.
Cervical spondylosis represents ‘wear and tear’ of the cervical spine. It
is common over the age of 60 years. Acute disc lesions usually occur in
the younger patient. A careful history is needed to exclude trauma.
Brachial plexus lesions refer pain down the arm and may result from
localised lesions, e.g. a cervical rib causing extrinsic compression will
affect T1 and cause wasting of the small muscles of the hands and
paraesthesia in the dermatomal distribution, i.e. the inner aspect of the
upper arm.
Subclavian artery stenosis will result in ‘claudication’ in the arm, i.e.
pain brought on by exercise, relieved by rest, due to inadequate blood
flow. A history of cardiac problems, e.g. AF or widespread arterial
disease, will suggest embolism or thrombosis. A sudden onset of a
painful, swollen, cyanotic limb will suggest axillary vein thrombosis.
Pain radiating into the left arm brought on by exercise and related to
central chest pain and pain radiating into the neck suggests myocardial
ischaemia. Pain associated with occupation, e.g. writing, wordprocessing (keyboard occupations), suggests repetitive strain injury. A
history of diabetes mellitus, renal failure, liver failure, alcohol abuse,
vitamin B12 deficiency, drugs, e.g. phenytoin or vincristine, suggests
peripheral neuropathy.
Pain, paraesthesia in the thumb, index and middle finger, which is
worse in bed at night and relieved by hanging the arm out of bed, would
suggest carpal tunnel syndrome. The latter may be associated with
pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, myxoedema, anterior dislocation of the
lunate, gout, acromegaly, amyloidosis and arteriovenous fistula at the

[START_SECTION]wrist created for haemodialysis.
Localised bone pain may be due to primary or secondary tumours.
The latter are most common and may result from a primary in the
breast, bronchus, thyroid, prostate or kidney. Pathological fractures may
occur. With compartment syndrome, there may be a history of crush
injury, vascular injury or vascular surgery. Chronic compartment
syndrome may result from unusual exertion, e.g. weight-lifting.

Examination
A full neurological examination should be carried out, looking for
cervical lesions, brachial plexus lesions or carpal tunnel syndrome.
There may be limitation in movements of the cervical spine. The limbs
should be examined for swelling, e.g. axillary vein thrombosis, when
there will be cyanosis and dilated veins. Examine for signs of ischaemia
and feel for pulses. The classical signs of an ischaemic limb, i.e. pain,
pallor, pulselessness, paraesthesia, ‘perishing cold’ and paralysis, may
be present. Occupation will suggest repetitive strain injury and there
will usually be little to find on examination. Horner’s syndrome (ptosis,
miosis, enophthalmos and anhidrosis) suggests Pancoast’s tumour. With
bone tumours, there will be localised swelling and tenderness. With
compartment syndrome, there will be a swollen tender compartment in
the forearm, paraesthesia and paralysis. Pulses may be normal initially;
later they are reduced or absent.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
WCC ↑ infection, e.g. osteomyelitis or cervical spine TB. ESR ↑ infection
and malignancy.
■ CRP
Infection/inflammatory cause.
■ Cervical spine X-ray
Cervical spondylosis, bony metastases, cervical spine fractures.

[START_SECTION]■ CXR
Malignancy resulting in bone secondary. Pancoast’s tumour (apical lung
tumour spreading to involve brachial plexus). Cervical rib (13 ribs).
■ ECG
Cardiac ischaemia.
■ Cardiac enzymes
Cardiac ischaemia.

Specific Investigations
■ CT
Cervical disc lesions, tumours.
■ MRI
Cervical disc lesions, tumours.
■ Nerve conduction studies
Brachial plexus lesions, peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome.
■ Duplex Doppler
Arterial or venous lesions.
■ Arteriography
Arterial lesions.
■ Venography
Venous lesions, e.g. axillary vein thrombosis.
• Angina may present only with pain in the left arm. Take a
careful history.
• Paraesthesia and weakness in association with arm pain
suggests nerve compression.

[START_SECTION]Arm Swellings
Swelling may be localised or generalised. Localised swellings may be
related to joints or fractures. Localised swellings around joints are
covered in the section on Joint disorders (p. 267). This section includes
only those conditions that may cause generalised swelling of the arm.

Causes
• Trauma
• Infection
• e.g. cellulitis, lymphangitis
• Axillary vein thrombosis
• Lymphoedema
• Congenital
• Acquired
• Axillary node lesions
• Carcinoma
• Infection, e.g. filariasis
• Excision
• Radiotherapy
• Other
• Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (Sudek’s atrophy)

History
A history of trauma will be obvious in many cases, although

[START_SECTION]pathological fractures may occur with little trauma. Reflex sympathetic
dystrophy may follow trauma, e.g. Colles’ fracture. Congenital
lymphoedema of the arm is rare; however, secondary lymphoedema is
not and a history of carcinoma of the breast, operations on the axilla or
radiotherapy to the axilla should be sought. There may be a history of a
puncture wound or flea bite, suggesting cellulitis or lymphangitis.
Streptococcal cellulitis is common following puncture wounds in
patients who already have lymphoedema of a limb. Axillary vein
thrombosis may come on after excessive or unusual exercise and has
been nicknamed ‘effort thrombosis’. An example is a patient who has
been painting a ceiling who is not used to doing that sort of thing. It may
occur in patients with cervical ribs or thoracic inlet obstruction.
Thrombosis may also occur following insertion of a central line.

Examination
There may be localised swelling and tenderness together with crepitus
associated with a fracture. There may be generalised non-pitting
oedema suggestive of lymphoedema. Examination of the axilla may
reveal a mass of lymph nodes, a scar suggestive of previous surgery or
the skin changes of previous radiotherapy. Examination of the breast
may reveal the site of a primary tumour that has resulted in secondary
axillary lymphadenopathy. With axillary vein thrombosis, there will be
swelling, cyanosis and prominent dilated veins on the arm. With
cellulitis, there may be redness and heat in the arm, and in lymphangitis,
there may be red, inflamed streaks along the line of lymphatic vessels.
With reflex sympathetic dystrophy, the limb becomes painful, swollen
and stiff, with a reddened, smooth, shiny appearance to the skin.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ tumour. WCC ↑ infection. ESR ↑ tumour or infection.
■ Swab

[START_SECTION]C&S of any lesion that may have resulted in cellulitis or lymphangitis.
■ CXR
Cervical rib (associated with axillary vein thrombosis).
■ Arm X-ray
Patchy porosis of bone with reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Possible
foreign body associated with cellulitis.

Specific Investigations
■ US or CT
Axillary mass.
■ Mammography
Breast carcinoma – axillary lymphadenopathy.
■ Duplex Doppler
Axillary vein thrombosis.
■ Venography
Axillary vein thrombosis.
• Always take a careful and detailed history. Trauma may
have been minimal and forgotten, e.g. an insect bite.
• Always examine the breast and axillary nodes.

[START_SECTION]Ascites
Ascites is the accumulation of excess free fluid in the peritoneal cavity
(Fig. 5).

FIGURE 5 CT scan of ascites.
There is free fluid throughout the peritoneal cavity (arrows).

Causes
Hepatic
• Cirrhosis
• Hepatic tumours

Malignant Disease
• Carcinomatosis
• Abdominal/pelvic tumour (primary or secondary)

[START_SECTION]• Pseudomyxoma peritonei
• Primary mesothelioma

Cardiac
• Cardiac failure
• Constrictive pericarditis
• Tricuspid incompetence

Renal
• Nephrotic syndrome

Peritonitis
• TB
• Spontaneous bacterial

Venous Obstruction
• Budd–Chiari syndrome
• Veno-occlusive disease
• Hepatic portal vein obstruction
• Inferior vena cava obstruction

Gastrointestinal
• Pancreatitis
• Malabsorption
• Bile ascites

History
Symptoms
Patients with ascites can present with abdominal discomfort, increasing
abdominal girth, weight gain and ankle or sacral swelling.

Onset

[START_SECTION]Onset
The development of ascites is usually gradual, but sudden onset can
result from acute decompensation of liver cirrhosis, malignancy, portal
or splenic vein thrombosis and Budd–Chiari syndrome.

Past medical history
Any history of malignancy in the abdomen or pelvis is relevant;
however, abdominal metastasis can also result in ascites, especially
from breast, ovarian, prostatic, testicular and haematological
malignancies. Cirrhosis of the liver may result from alcoholism,
previous hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, primary and secondary biliary
cirrhosis and haemochromatosis. A previous history of TB should raise
suspicion of secondary disease.

Associated symptoms
Shortness of breath can result from splinting of the diaphragm due to
tense ascites itself, or secondarily as part of the syndrome of cardiac
failure when it is the underlying cause.

Examination
Classical findings are shifting dullness and a fluid thrill. As liver disease
and carcinomatosis account for 90% of the cases presenting with ascites,
a detailed examination of all systems is required. The next commonest
causes are cardiac failure and nephrotic syndrome.

Inspection
Evidence of liver disease would be suggested by the presence of
jaundice, spider naevi, loss of body hair, gynaecomastia, palmar
erythema and caput medusae. The jugular venous pressure (JVP) is
elevated in the presence of cardiac failure, and a prominent ν wave is
seen with tricuspid regurgitation. Further elevation of the JVP on

[START_SECTION]inspiration (Kussmaul’s sign) may be observed with a pericardial
effusion.

Palpation
Careful abdominal examination should be performed to look for
possible abdominal or pelvic tumours. ‘Dipping’ may be required to feel
masses in the presence of gross ascites. Hepatomegaly and
splenomegaly can occur with portal hypertension and hepatic and
haematological malignancies. Displacement of the apex beat with
cardiomegaly may result from cardiac failure. Pedal oedema occurs
with cirrhosis, cardiac failure, malabsorption, obstruction of lymphatic
flow due to intra-abdominal or pelvic tumours, and nephrotic syndrome.

Auscultation
A third heart sound, systolic murmurs (functional tricuspid and mitral
regurgitation) and crepitations (pulmonary oedema) may be audible
with cardiac failure. Heart sounds are muffled with pericardial
effusions. A pericardial friction rub or knock is occasionally audible in
pericarditis.

Percussion
Dullness of the lung bases occurs with pulmonary oedema and pleural
effusions (which may occur secondary to ascites).

Internal examination
A rectal examination may reveal ulceration or a fixed mass suggestive of
a carcinoma. In women, an adnexal mass PV may be the first indication
of a pelvic tumour.

General Investigations

[START_SECTION]History and examination findings may reveal the underlying cause.
General investigations can be used to confirm or indicate the possible
aetiology.
■ Urine dipstick
Will be strongly positive for protein in nephrotic syndrome. If so, a 24hour urine collection for protein should be undertaken: more than
3.5 g/24 h is indicative of nephrotic syndrome.
■ FBC
A raised white count may indicate an infective aetiology but a
differential white count is more specific.
■ U&Es
Elevated urea and creatinine implies severe renal impairment, and may
occur as a component of hepatorenal syndrome, which is renal
impairment secondary to liver failure.
■ LFTs
May be deranged in the presence of liver disease. The serum albumin
will be able to indicate hypoalbuminaemia but the underlying cause
must still be sought.
■ CXR
Findings suggestive of cardiac failure are cardiomegaly, upper venous
diversion of blood, the presence of Kerley B lines, pulmonary oedema
and pleural effusions. Occasionally, the presence of carcinoma may be
suggested by a lesion in the lung fields.
■ US abdomen/pelvis
In addition to confirming the presence of ascites, US will detect any
intra-abdominal masses that are not palpable on clinical examination,
and visualise fatty deposits in the liver in the presence of cirrhosis.
Dilated collateral veins may be seen in conditions that result in
obstruction of the venous outflow of the liver, including cirrhosis and
Budd–Chiari syndrome.
■ Abdominal paracentesis
Aspiration of the ascitic fluid is very useful to help determine the
underlying cause. A sample should be sent to microbiology, clinical
chemistry and pathology.

[START_SECTION]Ascitic fluid
Appearance
Chylous
The milky white appearance of chylous ascites is due to obstruction of
the lymphatic ducts.
Bile-stained
Is suggestive of bile peritonitis.
Haemorrhagic
Can occur in malignancy, trauma and TB.
Straw-coloured
The usual appearance with most other causes.

Biochemistry
Protein
The ascitic protein levels are often used to classify the ascites as a
transudate or an exudate; however this may not always be reliable. A
transudate would be ascitic fluid with the protein concentration of less
than 25 g/L in the sample or 11 g/L lower than the serum protein level,
while an exudate is the opposite.
Amylase
Usually elevated in pancreatic ascites.
Glucose
Low in bacterial infections.
Triglyceride
Elevated in chylous ascites; may indicate obstruction of drainage of the

[START_SECTION]thoracic duct.
Bilirubin
Elevated in bile ascites.

Microbiology
Gram and Ziehl–Neelsen staining with cultures may be positive with a
bacterial aetiology.

Cytology
WCC
Neutrophilia is suggestive of a bacterial peritonitis, while tuberculous
peritonitis usually results in a lymphocytosis. Malignant cells may be
identified and a primary source may possibly be located.

Specific Investigations
■ Echocardiography
Cardiac failure will manifest as a dilated and poorly contracting
ventricle with a reduced ejection fraction. A pericardial effusion is
visible as an echo-free space between the left ventricle and the
pericardium. Tricuspid regurgitation can be visualised with colour-flow
Doppler imaging.
■ Liver biopsy
Will be able to confirm and may be able to ascertain the underlying
cause of liver cirrhosis.
■ Renal biopsy
Reveals the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome.
■ Portal venography
Is indicated if obstruction to the venous outflow of the liver is suspected
and can confirm Budd–Chiari syndrome and veno-occlusive disease.
• Ascites can result from abnormalities in a number of

[START_SECTION]different systems and a detailed examination of all systems is
required to avoid missing potentially treatable conditions,
such as cardiac failure and TB.

[START_SECTION]Axillary Swellings
The great majority of axillary swellings are enlarged lymph nodes.
Axillary nodes are often enlarged due to secondary deposits from
carcinoma of the breast. Most axillary swellings are easily diagnosed on
clinical examination alone.

Causes
Superficial
• Acute abscess
• Sebaceous cyst
• Lipoma
• Hidradenitis suppurativa

Deep
• Lymphadenopathy
• Breast lump (in the axillary tail)
• Lipoma
• Chronic abscess, e.g. TB
• Axillary artery aneurysm

History
Superficial
Acute abscess

[START_SECTION]This presents as a tender swelling in the skin. There may be a purulent
discharge. Common in diabetics.
■■
Sebaceous cyst
A sebaceous cyst will present as a firm swelling in the skin, often with a
punctum. It may be tender if it becomes inflamed and there may be
discharge from it.

Lipoma
This presents as a soft, lobulated swelling in the subcutaneous tissue.

Hidradenitis suppurativa
The patient presents with multiple teSTART_SECTIONnder swellings in the superficial
tissue of the axilla, the infection occurring in the apocrine sweat glands.
A purulent discharge usually occurs. There may be a history of diabetes.

Deep
Lymphadenopathy (p. 321)
The patient may have noticed a lump in the axilla, which may be tender
or non-tender. Check for a site of infection or malignancy in the region
of drainage of the nodes, i.e. the arm, the chest wall and the abdominal
wall as far down as, and including, the umbilicus, the skin of the back as
far down as the iliac crest and the breast. Has the patient noticed any
lumps elsewhere? Check for malaise, pyrexia, night sweats, cough.
There may be a history of bruising or epistaxis to suggest a blood
dyscrasia. Is there any evidence of scratches on the arm to suggest cat
scratch disease?

Breast lumps
Occasionally a lump in the medial wall of the axilla may be a swelling
in the axillary tail of the breast, e.g. fibroadenoma or carcinoma.

[START_SECTION]Lipoma
Occasionally the patient may notice a firm swelling which appears
intermittently, slipping out from under cover of the muscles.

Chronic abscess
Check for a history of TB. There may be night sweats.

Axillary artery aneurysm
This is rare. The patient may notice a pulsatile swelling under the arm.
When the swelling becomes large, the patient may notice the arm
moving away from the side of the body with each heart beat.
Occasionally there may be symptoms in the hand due to distal
embolisation.

Examination
Superficial
Acute abscess
There may be a tender, red, fluctuant swelling with purulent discharge.

Lipoma
There will be a soft, lobulated swelling in the subcutaneous tissue.

Sebaceous cyst
A small, well-defined swelling in the skin. A punctum may be visible. If
it is infected, the surrounding skin will be red and the lesion tender.
Discharge may be present.

Hidradenitis suppurativa
Multiple tender swellings with surrounding erythema and discharge of
pus are present.

[START_SECTION]Deep
Chronic abscess
A fluctuant swelling presents in the axilla. With TB, there may be little
or no signs of inflammation.

Lymphadenopathy
Single discrete node, e.g. lymphoma. Numerous hard nodes or matting
of nodes (carcinoma). Tender fluctuant nodes (abscess). Check for
infection or tumour in the area of drainage of the lymphatics. Examine
the breast. Check all other sites of nodes, e.g. cervical, inguinal; check
for hepatosplenomegaly.

Lipoma
Deep lipomas are usually intermuscular and may be felt only in certain
positions. They may slip in and out between the pectoral muscles. They
may be firmer and not have the lobulated feel of a more superficial
lipoma.

Axillary artery aneurysm
A pulsatile mass will be palpable within the axilla. Check the distal
circulation. If an axillary artery aneurysm is large, when the patient
stands with the arms by the sides, the arm moves away from the side of
the body as the lump pulsates.

Breast lumps
A lump on the medial wall of the axilla may be a lump in the axillary
tail of the breast.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ malignant disease. WCC ↑ infection or leukaemia. ESR ↑ infection

[START_SECTION]and malignancy. Platelets ↓ leukaemia.
■ Swab
C&S, microscopy of any discharge.

Special Investigations
■ CXR
TB.
■ US
Lymphadenopathy, lipoma, aneurysm.
■ Mantoux test
TB.
■ FNAC
Benign versus malignant.
■ Mammography
Carcinoma of the breast.
■ Arteriography
Assess distal circulation with axillary artery aneurysm.
• Always examine the breast – in both male and female
patients.
• Always examine all other potential sites for
lymphadenopathy.

[START_SECTION]Backache
Backache is one of the most common complaints seen in general
practice and orthopaedic clinics. It accounts for about 20% of referrals to
orthopaedic clinics. Most causes are either traumatic or degenerative
but other causes are numerous and may occur as a result of pathology in
almost any system of the body.

Causes
Congenital
• Kyphoscoliosis
• Spina bifida
• Spondylolisthesis

Acquired
Traumatic
• Vertebral fractures
• Ligamentous injury
• Joint strain
• Muscle tears

Infective
• Osteomyelitis – acute and chronic
• TB • (common in parts of the world where TB is endemic)
• Discitis

Inflammatory
• Ankylosing spondylitis (Fig. 6)

[START_SECTION]• Rheumatology disorders

Gynaecological
• Pelvic inflammatory disease
• Endometriosis
• Uterine tumours

History
Congenital
The diagnosis is usually apparent from the history, although with
spondylolisthesis, the symptoms, i.e. low lumbar backache, worse on
standing, may not present until late childhood or early adult life.

[START_SECTION]Acquired
General
The speed of onset is important. Sudden onset back pain may be due to
trauma or disc lesions, whereas gradual onset of pain may be due to
conditions such as degenerative disease. Mechanical lesions impinging
on the cord can result in neurological symptoms such as bladder
dysfunction (urinary retention). Symptoms worse on movement and
relieved by rest suggest a mechanical cause, whereas pain that is severe
and unrelenting can occur with malignant causes. In addition, there may
be symptoms (other than musculoskeletal) related to the underlying
cause such as abdominal pain, dysuria or menorrhagia.

Traumatic
There will usually be a clear history of trauma. Care must be taken in
moving the patient. Neurological sequelae may be obvious.

Infective
There may be a history of TB; the patient may have had night sweats or
cough. Osteomyelitis of the spine may also occur in diabetes and the
immunocompromised, in which case the organism is more commonly
Staphylococcus aureus. With spinal TB, the patient is usually young and
complains of malaise, fever, pain, tenderness and limitation of
movement of the spine. Discitis usually presents with mild backache
accompanied by leg pain.

Inflammatory
Ankylosing spondylitis usually affects young adult males. The
sacroiliac joints are affected initially, then the whole spine. The patient
usually presents with lumbar stiffness, especially when rising in the
morning. Iritis and plantar fasciitis may also occur. Rheumatology
disorders may present with symptoms in other joints.

[START_SECTION]Neoplastic
The patient is usually unwell with severe unrelenting pain, often
localised to a particular area of the spine. There may be a past history of
a primary tumour (e.g. bronchus, breast, thyroid, prostate or kidney) or
the primary may not be apparent. The pain may have been of sudden
onset with a pathological fracture resulting in a collapsed vertebra.
Rarely paraplegia may be a presenting symptom. Myeloma may present
with backache.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis usually presents in the older patient, with pain made
worse on movement and relieved by rest. With intervertebral disc
lesions, there is usually sudden onset of pain radiating down the back of
the leg (sciatica). The pain is worse on movement, coughing and
straining. Neurological symptoms may be present, e.g. weakness of a
limb or bladder symptoms.

Metabolic
Osteoporosis is commonest in post-menopausal women. Osteoporosis
itself does not cause pain but pathological fractures of the vertebra may
occur, causing pain. Bone pain and pathological fractures occur.
Osteomalacia may occur in adults with a history of gastrectomy,
steatorrhoea, renal failure or anticonvulsant therapy.

Endocrine
There may be a history of Cushing’s disease or long-term steroid
therapy.

Idiopathic
Paget’s disease of bone may cause backache. This usually occurs over
the age of 40 years. The patient may have noted other changes, e.g.
enlargement of the face or bowing of the leg. Scheuermann’s disease is
osteochondritis of the spine. It causes backache in adolescence. The

[START_SECTION]patient may present because the parents have noticed round shoulders.

Psychogenic
This is very common. Check for malingering, anxiety, depression and
compensation neurosis.

Visceral
With penetrating peptic ulcer, the patient complains of epigastric pain
radiating straight through to the back. The pain may be relieved by food
and antacids. With carcinoma of the pancreas, the patient will describe a
boring pain in the back, which is unrelenting. There will be a history of
anorexia and weight loss. The patient may be jaundiced. With carcinoma
of the rectum, invasion of the sacrum and the sacral plexus may occur,
causing low back pain with sciatica.

Vascular
Aortic aneurysm may cause back pain by eroding into the vertebral
bodies. Alternatively, it may cause severe back pain due to rupture. The
patient may have noticed a pulsation in the abdomen. Acute aortic
dissection usually gives a severe tearing back pain associated with chest
pain. The patient is usually shocked.

Renal
There is usually a dull, boring ache with carcinoma of the kidney. The
patient may also complain of haematuria. With ureteric colic, the pain
radiates from loin to groin and is severe, the patient being unable to get
into a comfortable position. Inflammatory disease of the kidney presents
with upper lumbar back pain. The patient may be feverish with rigors,
and complain of frequency and dysuria.

Gynaecological
The pain is usually low back pain associated with pelvic discomfort.
The patient may also complain of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia or post-

[START_SECTION]menopausal bleeding.

Examination
General
Acute cord compression will cause bilateral leg pain with lower motor
neurone signs at the level of the compression, and upper motor neurone
signs below. Check for sphincter disturbance. Acute cauda equina
compression causes root pain in the legs, saddle anaesthesia and
disturbances of bladder and bowel function. In any patient with acute
backache, the above signs should be sought and, if found, the
appropriate urgent referral made to a neurosurgeon or spinal surgeon.

Congenital
Kyphoscoliosis and spina bifida are usually obvious on examination.
With spondylolisthesis, a ‘step’ may be palpable in the line of the
spinous processes, with a skin crease below. It usually involves L5
slipping on S1, or, less commonly, L4 slipping on L5. Occasionally,
there are neurological signs in the limbs.

Acquired
Traumatic
This will usually be obvious. Careful positioning of the patient and full
neurological examination should be carried out. Always check for
associated injuries.

Infective
With acute osteomyelitis, there is pyrexia, malaise and local tenderness
and spasm. With chronic osteomyelitis, e.g. due to TB, there will be
wasting of the paraspinal muscles, spasm and restricted movements.
There may be a localised kyphosis or ‘gibbus’ due to vertebral collapse.

[START_SECTION]A psoas abscess may be present in the groin. Paraplegia may occur.
With discitis, there will be reduced movement of the spine.

Inflammatory
The patient with ankylosing spondylitis will present with a stiff spine.
There will be flexion of the hips and spine. In the advanced case, the
patient cannot raise the head to see in front. Check for iritis and plantar
fasciitis. Rheumatological disease will also present with problems in
other joints.

Neoplastic
With myeloma, in addition to backache, there may be pain in the ribs,
long bones and skull. Bone tenderness will be present with secondary
deposits. Palpate along the spine for tenderness. Check the chest,
thyroid, breast, kidney and prostate for malignancy. Check for any
neurological signs.

Degenerative
There will be limitation of movement of the spine with osteoarthritis.
With acute disc lesion, there will be limitation of spine movement,
lordosis and neurological symptoms of the lower limbs. Carry out a full
neurological examination.

Metabolic
There may be evidence of recent vertebral collapse. Loss of height and
curvature of the spine may eventually occur. With osteomalacia, apart
from bone pain, there may be proximal myopathy, resulting in a
waddling gait.

Endocrine
There may be signs of Cushing’s disease or prolonged steroid therapy,
e.g. cushingoid facies, buffalo hump, proximal myopathy, abdominal
striae, etc.

[START_SECTION]Idiopathic
In Paget’s disease, check for changes in the skull and long bones
(bowing of the tibia). Compressive symptoms due to skull enlargement
may result in blindness, deafness or cranial nerve entrapment. There
may be signs of high-output cardiac failure due to vascularity of bone. In
Scheuermann’s disease, there will be a smooth, thoracic kyphosis and,
below this, a compensatory lumbar lordosis. The chest is flat.

Psychogenic
This is often difficult to assess. Signs may vary from examination to
examination. There may be exaggeration of symptoms during the
examination. It is best to watch from a distance as the patient leaves the
consulting room. The gait, posture and demeanour may suddenly
change!

Visceral
Check for epigastric tenderness or mass. Jaundice may be present in
pancreatic cancer, and the gall bladder may be palpable (Courvoisier’s
law). Carry out a digital rectal examination to check for rectal
carcinoma.

Vascular
A pulsatile abdominal mass may be palpable. The patient may be
shocked. With acute aortic dissection, there may be shock with disparity
of pulses in the extremities.

Renal
Check for renal masses or loin tenderness.

Gynaecological
Check for pelvic masses. Carry out bimanual examination.

signs should be sought and, if found, urgent referral made to a
neurosurgeon.
• Always remember renal and pancreatic disease and aortic
aneurysm as a cause of backache.

[START_SECTION]Breast Lumps
A lump in the breast is a common clinical presentation. In every case of
a breast lump, in both males and females, carcinoma must be excluded.

Causes
Discrete Lumps
Malignant
• Carcinoma (Fig. 7)
• Phyllodes tumour (some behave in benign fashion)

FIGURE 7 Left-sided breast cancer.
Note the skin tethering and the nipple retraction.

Benign
• Fibroadenoma
• Cyst (in cystic mastitis)
• Duct ectasia

[START_SECTION]• Sebaceous cyst
• Galactocele
• Fat necrosis
• Lipoma
• Tuberculous abscess • (common in parts of the world where
TB is endemic)

Generalised Swelling
• Pregnancy
• Lactation
• Puberty
• Mastitis

Swellings Behind the Breast
• Retromammary abscess from chest disease
• Tietze’s disease
• Rib deformities
• Chondroma of the costal cartilages

History
A diagnosis of carcinoma is suggested by a strong family history,
nulliparous state, early menarche, late menopause and history of cystic
hyperplasia. The patient may have found a breast lump (carcinoma is
painless in 85% of cases) or may have noticed nipple retraction, skin
dimpling, axillary swelling. Jaundice may have occurred due to liver
secondaries or porta hepatis node involvement. Bone pain may be due to
secondary deposits and pathological fractures. Breathlessness may be
due to lung secondaries or a pleural effusion. Personality change, fits,
headaches suggest cerebral metastases. A patient who presents in
pregnancy or lactation may have mastitis, abscess or galactocele. A
history of trauma suggests fat necrosis. A patient in the fifth decade with
retroareolar pain, nipple retraction and a thick, creamy nipple discharge

[START_SECTION]suggests duct ectasia. The patient presenting between the ages of 15 and
25 years with a non-tender swelling suggests fibroadenoma. A patient
with a history of painful breasts may have one of the conditions
described under breast pain (p. 56). Enquiries should be made of a past
history of TB, as rarely a tuberculous abscess may form within the
breast or erode through the chest wall from the lung.

Examination
Carcinoma
Hard irregular swelling. May be fixed to the skin or fixed deeply. Skin
dimpling. Nipple retraction. Peau d’orange. Paget’s disease of the nipple.
Axillary lymphadenopathy. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Hepatomegaly. Pathological fractures – spine, ribs, long bones.

Phyllodes Tumour
Mobile mass may become very large.

Fibroadenoma
Smooth, rounded, mobile mass. Breast ‘mouse’ (so-called because it
darts about under the examining fingers).

Cyst
Smooth, mobile swelling. May be tender. May be associated with
generalised lumpiness of the breast.

Galactocele
Smooth, mobile swelling occurring in the lactating breast.

Fat necrosis

[START_SECTION]Hard, irregular swelling. May be overlying bruising of the skin or teeth
marks! Occasionally the lesion is fixed to the skin and is difficult to
distinguish from carcinoma.

Lipoma
Soft, lobulated swelling. Rare on the breast. ‘Pseudolipoma’ is a
bunching of fat between retracted suspensory ligaments of the breast
and is associated with an underlying carcinoma.

Duct ectasia
Tender retroareolar area. Retroareolar erythema. Nipple retraction.
Thick, creamy nipple discharge.

Sebaceous cyst
Mobile swelling fixed to the skin. May be a punctum. May be infected,
with discharge and surrounding redness.

Generalised swellings
Generalised swelling of the breast may occur in pregnancy, lactation
and puberty. It may also occur with mastitis, when the breast is
enlarged, red, tender and hot.

Swellings behind the breast
These are rare. Tietze’s disease is the most common. There will be
prominence and tenderness over the second, third and fourth costal
cartilages. With retromammary abscess, chest signs may be obvious on
percussion and also on auscultation of the chest.

General Investigations

• Breast lumps after the menopause are most likely to be due
to carcinoma.
• A lump occurring after trauma may be due to fat necrosis.
Re-examine after a few weeks. If it has not resolved,
investigation is required.

[START_SECTION]Breast Pain
Pain in the breast is a common symptom in general surgical practice.
Most cases are benign and due to cyclical mastalgia, but occasionally
pain may be the presenting symptom of carcinoma.

Causes
• Cyclical mastalgia (fibroadenosis, cystic mastitis)
• Non-cyclical mastalgia
• Duct ectasia
• Breast abscess (Fig. 8)
• Pregnancy
• Lactation
• Carcinoma (15% of lumps are painful)
• Fat necrosis
• Mastitis
• Tietze’s disease
• Mondor’s disease
• Rib secondaries
• Herpes zoster

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 8 A large abscess of the left breast.
Note the redness and swelling.

History
Cyclical mastalgia causes soreness, frequently in the upper and outer
quadrants of the breast in the week preceding a period. The pain usually
disappears after the period and there is freedom from soreness or pain
for two weeks, when it recommences. Symptoms are common in the 20–
45-year age group. Non-cyclical mastalgia may occur and is more
common in the fourth and fifth decades. Duct ectasia occurs in the fifth
decade. The pain is usually behind the nipple and associated with
subareolar erythema and a thick, creamy nipple discharge. Fat necrosis
will be suggested by a history of trauma, which occasionally the patient
will be embarrassed to admit (often the partner’s teeth!). Breast abscess
or mastitis will be obvious. It usually occurs during pregnancy or
lactation but it may occur in a retroareolar position in a patient with
duct ectasia. Breast fullness and soreness is a symptom of early
pregnancy. Patients may indicate breast pain where the condition is not
actively in the breast but behind it. Tietze’s disease (costochondritis of
the costal cartilages) will present with pain related to the breast.
Mondor’s disease (superficial thrombophlebitis of the subcutaneous

[START_SECTION]veins of the chest wall) also presents with pain in the breast. It may be
associated with an underlying carcinoma. Rib secondaries may also
present with pain behind the breast. Herpes zoster may present with
pain radiating round into the breast and precedes the development of a
vesicular eruption by 2–3 days.

Examination
A hard, irregular lump is suggestive of carcinoma (this is discussed in
the section on Breast lumps). Tenderness and lumpiness, occasionally
with a smooth, mobile swelling (cyst), is suggestive of cyclical
mastalgia. The tenderness and lumpiness is most often palpated in the
upper and outer quadrants of the breast. In the early stages of fat
necrosis, there may be bruising over the breast and the lump is tender. In
the later stages, it becomes hard and irregular and may be tethered to the
skin. Breast abscess will present with redness, swelling, heat and pain in
the breast during pregnancy or, more commonly, lactation. The swelling
will be fluctuant and usually there is associated fever. Duct ectasia
presents with subareolar erythema, tenderness and occasionally a
subareolar lump. Nipple retraction may be present in longstanding
cases and there may be a thick, creamy discharge that can be expressed
from the nipple. Pregnancy will present with fullness of the breast and
increased circumareolar pigmentation. In Tietze’s disease, there will be
tenderness, and occasionally swelling over the second, third and fourth
costal cartilages. In Mondor’s disease, the veins of the chest wall are felt
as red, tender cords, often extending onto the anterior axillary fold. The
breast should be carefully checked for an underlying mass, as the
condition may be associated with carcinoma of the breast. Herpes zoster
will usually present with a characteristic vesicular eruption a few days
after the pain.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
WCC ↑ mastitis and breast abscess. ESR ↑ widespread carcinoma.

• Always examine the breasts in a patient with breast pain,
even if the history strongly suggests cyclical mastalgia.
• Pain is a relatively uncommon presenting symptom of
breast cancer but always examine the breasts.
• In women of childbearing age, always consider the
likelihood of pregnancy as a cause of breast pain.

[START_SECTION]Chest Pain
Chest pain is a common presenting symptom of disorders that can range
from trivial to life-threatening.

Causes
Cardiovascular
• Angina
• Myocardial infarction
• Pericarditis
• Acute aortic dissection

Gastrointestinal
• Reflux oesophagitis
• Peptic ulcer disease
• Oesophageal spasm

Pulmonary
• Pneumonia
• Pneumothorax
• Pulmonary embolism

Musculoskeletal
• Chest wall injuries
• Herpes zoster
• Costochondritis
• Bornholm disease
• Secondary tumours of the rib

[START_SECTION]Emotional
• Depression

History
Character
The character of angina is tight and crushing, while the pain from aortic
dissection has a tearing quality. Oesophageal reflux may be described as
a burning pain, and peptic acid-related pain tends to be deep and
gnawing.

Location
The pain from angina and oesophageal reflux may be located
retrosternally, and they both can radiate to the jaw or down into the left
arm. The pain from pericarditis may be centrally located and radiate to
the shoulders (trapezius ridge pain). Pain from aortic dissection often
radiates into the back and occasionally into the abdomen (depending on
the extent of the dissection). Pulmonary pain can be located anywhere in
the thorax.

Precipitating factors
Angina may be precipitated by effort, a defining characteristic. Other
known precipitants of angina are emotion, food and cold weather. If
angina occurs at rest for more than 20 min, it should be treated as a
myocardial infarction until proven otherwise. Oesophageal reflux is
often related to meals and precipitated by changes in posture, such as
bending or lying. Pain originating from pericarditis and pulmonary
origin is often pleuritic, i.e. worse on inspiration; however,
musculoskeletal pain can also be worse on breathing due to movement
of the thorax.

[START_SECTION]Relieving factors
Both oesophageal spasm and angina may be relieved by GTN, which
relaxes smooth muscle. Antacids will relieve the pain of oesophageal
reflux but not angina. The pain associated with pericarditis may be
relieved by sitting forwards.

Trauma
A history of a blunt or stretching injury immediately suggests the
underlying aetiology of chest wall tenderness and it is important to
diagnose rib fractures that can result from more severe trauma.
Pathological rib fractures that result from minor injuries may be due to
bony metastasis or osteoporosis.

Emotion
Occasionally chest pain is a somatic manifestation of patients with
depression or anxiety, but it is essential to exclude all organic causes
before accepting depression or anxiety as the underlying cause.
Moreover, a serious aetiology may co-exist.

Examination
Temperature
Pyrexia can occur with pneumonia, myocardial infarction, pericarditis
and herpes zoster infection.

Pulse
Heart rate on its own is not discriminating, as pain invariably leads to
tachycardia. However, palpating both upper and lower limb pulses may
be useful. Occasionally peripheral pulses are absent in patients with
aortic dissection.

[START_SECTION]JVP
The JVP is elevated with congestive cardiac failure and acute right
ventricular failure, an occasional complication of inferior myocardial
infarction and pulmonary embolism (when more than 60% of the
pulmonary vascular supply is occluded).

Palpation of the chest
Chest wall tenderness would imply a musculoskeletal cause. The
presence of unilateral tenderness confined to a single or adjacent group
of dermatomes would suggest either central (vertebral or spinal origin)
or peripheral nerve pathology (herpes zoster infection). The trachea
deviates away from the side of a tension pneumothorax, and chest
expansion is decreased on the same side for pneumonia and
pneumothorax. Dullness to percussion will be noted in an area of
consolidation with pneumonia and hyperresonance with pneumothorax
(a difficult sign to interpret).

Auscultation of the chest
The unilateral absence of breath sounds is consistent with a
pneumothorax; more localised loss occurs over an effusion. Bronchial
breath sounds are audible over a segment of consolidation and
sometimes above the level of an effusion. Localised areas of crepitations
are audible with lobar pneumonia, whereas widespread crepitations
suggest multilobar involvement or pulmonary oedema secondary to left
ventricular failure (from myocardial infarction).
A friction rub may be auscultated with both pericardial and pleuritic
disease, but only a pericardial rub will be present when the patient holds
the breath.

Lower limbs
Hemiparesis can occur with aortic dissection, and a hot, swollen, tender

[START_SECTION]calf or thigh may give a clue to an underlying deep vein thrombosis.
Measurements of the mid-thigh or mid-calf circumference may
demonstrate a larger circumference on the side of a DVT.

General Investigations
■ FBC
An elevated white cell count will be expected with pneumonia and, to a
lesser extent, in a myocardial infarction.
■ Serum cardiac markers
Following a myocardial infarction, cardiac troponin rises within six
hours and remains elevated for up to two weeks.
■ ECG (Fig. 9)
Angina or a myocardial infarct will result in ECG changes following the
anatomical pattern of coronary vascular insufficiency. Involvement of
the left main coronary artery would result in ECG changes of ischaemia
or infarction in the anterior (V3–4) and left lateral (V4–6) leads.
Involvement of the left anterior descending artery will be reflected in the
anterior leads, and insufficiency of the posterior descending artery will
produce changes in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF). Changes suggestive of
ischaemia or NSTEMI are ST segment depression and T wave inversion.
Elevated serum cardiac markers distinguish NSTEMI from angina. ST
segment elevation infarcts (STEMI), by definition, produce ST segment
elevation and Q wave formation in the corresponding leads. Pulmonary
emboli usually result in non-specific ECG changes, such as tachycardia,
right axis deviation, right ventricular strain and atrial fibrillation.
Occasionally one may find the S1Q3T3 pattern (S wave in lead I, Q wave
and an inverted T wave in lead III), indicative of right heart strain.
■ CXR
The line of the pleura with absence of lung markings distal to it is the
usual finding for a pneumothorax. Areas of consolidation on a chest film
may be confined to a lobe or widespread in bronchopneumonia. The
classic wedge-shaped shadow (base is distal) of a pulmonary embolus is
rare, and occurs only if pulmonary infarction resulted. Dissection of the

[START_SECTION]aorta may widen its width, causing a bulge to appear at the right
mediastinal border. Rib fractures or secondary deposits in ribs may be
visible.

FIGURE 9 Anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Specific Investigations
■ V/Q scan
Will show a mismatch in the majority of pulmonary emboli.
■ Pulmonary angiography
Pulmonary emboli will be delineated. It is possible to visualise the site
and extent of the embolism and it may also be possible to extract the
emboli using a catheter.
■ CT aortography
Confirm and assess the extent and site of the dissection of the aorta.
■ Upper GI tract endoscopy
Oesophagitis.
■ Oesophageal manometry
Abnormal oesophageal pressures.
• It is important to perform a prompt history, examination
and initial investigations in patients who present with chest
pain, as a number of conditions require urgent management.
• If tension pneumothorax is suspected as a cause of chest
pain, do not wait for a chest film. Decompress the
pneumothorax immediately with a large-bore cannula
inserted into the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular

[START_SECTION]line.

[START_SECTION]Clubbing
Clubbing is the selective bulbous enlargement of the distal segments of
fingers or toes due to proliferation of connective tissues (Fig. 10).

FIGURE 10 Clubbing.
Note the exaggerated longitudinal curvature and the loss of angle between the nail and
the nailbed.

Causes
Respiratory
• Bronchial carcinoma
• Chronic suppurative lung disease
• Bronchiectasis
• Lung abscess

[START_SECTION]• Empyema
• Cystic fibrosis
• Interstitial lung disease (fibrosing alveolitis, pulmonary
fibrosis)

Cardiovascular
• Infective endocarditis • (common in developing countries)
• Congenital cyanotic heart disease

Gastrointestinal
• Cirrhosis
• Ulcerative colitis
• Crohn’s disease
• Coeliac disease

Other
• Graves’ disease (hyperthyroidism)
• Familial
Clubbing is said to be present when there is loss of the
normal angle between the base of the nail and the nailfold. In
the presence of clubbing, when the fingernails from each
hand are placed together, the gap is lost and this is known as
Schamroth’s sign. Other features are increased curvature of
the nailbed (in all directions), sponginess or fluctuation and
expansion of the end of the digit to resemble a drumstick.

History
A systematic approach to the history is required to determine the cause
of clubbing. Respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system
enquiries should be made in an attempt to determine the underlying
cause. A detailed discussion on the diagnosis of congenital cyanotic
heart disease (tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of great arteries, total

[START_SECTION]anomalous pulmonary venous drainage) is beyond the scope of this text.

Duration
The duration of clubbing may give an indication of the underlying
aetiology. Clubbing present since infancy would suggest a familial trait
or congenital cyanotic heart disease. Alternatively, it may be a
secondary manifestation of hereditary disorders such as coeliac disease
and cystic fibrosis.

Respiratory symptoms
A history of cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea and weight loss in a chronic
smoker should alert the clinician to the diagnosis of bronchial
carcinoma. Symptoms of metastasis (bone pain, jaundice) and
paraneoplastic involvement (neuropathy, thirst and polyuria from
hypercalcaemia) should also be ascertained. With bronchial carcinoma,
clubbing may be part of a generalised arthritic manifestation of
hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
Cough productive of copious amounts of purulent sputum is usually
the main complaint with bronchiectasis. With a chronic lung abscess or
empyema, the symptoms are often less specific and may be preceded by
a history of pneumonia or aspiration secondary to neurological
disorders, dysphagia or alcoholism. Patients may present with a
persistent low-grade pyrexia, malaise, weight loss and productive
cough. Shortness of breath and a non-productive cough characterise
interstitial lung disease.

Gastrointestinal symptoms
Malaise, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss are experienced by
most patients with inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease. The
presence of aphthous ulceration, fistulae and perianal sepsis are
suggestive of Crohn’s disease. Predominantly rectal involvement with
tenesmus, mucus and blood PR is more characteristic of ulcerative

[START_SECTION]colitis; however, differentiation based on the history alone can be very
difficult. Symptoms of coeliac disease tend to be very variable and nonspecific, with non-bloody diarrhoea with steatorrhoea.
Heavy alcohol consumption or previous infection with hepatitis B
will predispose to cirrhosis of the liver. Patients may complain of
jaundice, abdominal distension due to ascites (p. 35), upper
gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to varices or bruising from impaired
clotting (p. 548). Severely affected individuals may present with
encephalopathy or even coma (p. 69).

Family history
A family history of clubbing or cystic fibrosis will suggest a hereditary
cause. Approximately 15% of patients with coeliac disease will have an
affected first-degree relative.

Examination
Inspection
The presence of wasting may be accounted for by cachexia of
malignancy or chronic lung or gastrointestinal disease. The mucous
membranes should be inspected for central cyanosis, which may be a
feature of, or sequel to, congenital cyanotic heart disease. Cyanosis may
also be noticeable with any of the above causes of severe lung disease.
Aphthous ulceration occurs with Crohn’s and coeliac disease. A goitre,
exophthalmos, ophthalmoplegia and a resting tremor are features of
Graves’ disease.
With infective endocarditis, splinter haemorrhages, Osler’s nodes
(raised tender lesions on the pulps of the fingers) and Janeway lesions
(flat non-tender macules on the palms and soles) may also be present.

Temperature
Pyrexia is notable in several important causes of clubbing, namely

[START_SECTION]suppurative lung disease, infective endocarditis and active inflammatory
bowel disease.

Examination of the chest
Auscultation of the precordium may reveal new or changing murmurs
with infective endocarditis. Widespread coarse crepitations of the lungs
occur with retained secretions of bronchiectasis. Fine quality endinspiratory crepitations are suggestive of interstitial lung disease. More
localised coarse crepitations and dullness to percussion may be found
with a lung abscess. Findings suggestive of pleural effusion (unilateral
decreased expansion, dullness to percussion and absent breath sounds)
may be due to malignancy. However, when this is associated with
pyrexia in an ill patient, it should lead to the consideration of a thoracic
empyema.

Abdominal examination
On abdominal examination, signs of chronic liver disease (p. 37) may be
present; however, there may be few specific features to suggest
inflammatory bowel disease. When this diagnosis is suspected, a
sigmoidoscopy should always be performed. Occasionally, right iliac
fossa tenderness or a mass may be found in Crohn’s disease. The
presence of splenomegaly may indicate portal hypertension with liver
disease, or enlargement accompanying infective endocarditis.

General Investigations
■ FBC
Hb ↓ carcinomatosis, inflammatory bowel disease, infective
endocarditis. WCC ↑ lung abscess, empyema, inflammatory bowel
disease.
■ ESR
malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, infective endocarditis.
■ LFTs

[START_SECTION]Liver disease.
■ CXR
Should be performed if respiratory symptoms are present. Bronchial
carcinoma may manifest as a hilar or peripheral opacity, cavitating
mass, collapse of a segment of lung due to luminal obstruction, pleural
effusion, elevated hemidiaphragm due to phrenic nerve palsy or
destruction of an adjacent rib due to invasion. Lung abscesses present as
a spherical shadow with a central lucency or air-fluid level.
Bronchiectatic lungs have visibly dilated bronchi and multiple areas of
consolidation. With fibrosing alveolitis, hazy shadowing of the lung
bases produces a honeycomb appearance.

Specific Investigations
In view of the diverse nature of causes of clubbing, further investigations
should be guided by the history and findings on clinical examination.
■ Urinalysis
Blood from microemboli in infective endocarditis.
■ Blood cultures (three sets in total: two sites at the same time and then
one taken 12 hours later)
Infective endocarditis.
■ Echocardiography
Useful in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, especially in the
presence of large vegetations.
■ Sigmoidoscopy
Inflammatory bowel disease – characteristic findings include
erythematous mucosa, areas of haemorrhage, contact bleeding and
ulceration.
■ Rectal and colonic biopsy
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
■ Colonoscopy
Inflammatory bowel disease.
■ Barium enema
Inflammatory bowel disease.

[START_SECTION]■ Small bowel enema
Crohn’s disease.
■ Anti-tissue transglutaminase (ATA)
Coeliac disease.
■ Jejunal biopsy
Coeliac disease. May reveal subtotal villous atrophy reversible with a
gluten-free diet.
■ CT thorax
Should be performed if bronchial carcinoma or thoracic empyema is
suspected. Also useful to confirm the diagnosis of bronchiectasis and
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
• Malignancy must be excluded when clubbing develops.
Localising features such as respiratory or gastrointestinal
disease associated with weight loss and raised inflammatory
markers are ominous signs. Investigation is tailored to the
presentation.

[START_SECTION]Coma
Coma results from sustained impairment of awareness of self and of the
environment. It can simply be defined as a state of unconsciousness or
numerically categorised as a GCS score of<8.

Causes
Trauma
• Head injury (diffuse axonal injury)
• Extradural haemorrhage (Fig. 11)
• Subdural haemorrhage

FIGURE 11 CT of the head.
There is a left-sided extradural haematoma (arrow). The haematoma is
confined giving rise to its characteristic biconvex shape, with a welldefined margin.

[START_SECTION]Metabolic
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Hypoglycaemia
• Hypothermia
• Hyperglycaemia
• Hyponatraemia
• Hypernatraemia

Organ Failure
• Cardiac/circulatory failure
• Respiratory failure
• Liver failure (encephalopathy)
• Renal failure (uraemic coma)
• Hypothyroidism

Vascular
• Stroke
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage

Infective
• Meningitis
• Encephalitis
• Cerebral malaria in the developed world • (common in
endemic areas)

Toxin/Drug-Induced
• Alcohol
• Overdose (opiates, tricyclics, benzodiazepines)
• Carbon monoxide poisoning

Cerebral
• Epilepsy
• Brain tumour
• Brain abscess

[START_SECTION]History
The history for the comatose patient is usually obtained co-laterally
from relatives, friends, witnesses or ambulance crew. Other sources of
information are previous hospital notes, records kept by general
practitioners and tablets or prescriptions that have been found at the
patient’s premises.

Presentation
The circumstances regarding discovery of the patient is usually the first
piece of information to be reported. Trauma patients may have been
transported from sites of road traffic accidents, fire or have been found
assaulted on the street. When teenagers are brought in unconscious from
a night club, it is important to exclude alcohol intoxication, epilepsy,
hypoglycaemia and the effects of illicit drugs (e.g. malignant
hyperthermia with ‘ecstasy’). Attempted suicides may have an
accompanying note or drug bottles may have been recovered from the
scene. Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs with suicide attempts in
enclosed areas with running engines or may be a complication in
victims involved with fires. Patients who have been brought in from cold
environments may also have hypothermia in addition to the primary
event.

Onset
When witnessed, information regarding the speed of onset of coma may
help in determining a cause. Sudden onset of unconsciousness is
characteristic of a seizure or a vascular event.

Trauma
Head injuries are a common cause of coma, but not all causes are due to
blunt trauma to the cranium. Diffuse axonal injury results from severe
shearing forces on the brain, a sequel to rapid acceleration and

[START_SECTION]deceleration forces. Blunt head injuries may cause extradural
haemorrhages as a result of skull fractures with laceration of meningeal
arteries. There is usually a history of an injury with transient loss of
consciousness, a lucid interval in which the patient feels and appears
well, followed by drowsiness, headache, vomiting, progressive
hemiplegia and eventually coma. Subdural haemorrhages are a
consequence of severe trauma, with cortical lacerations or less severe
trauma, with laceration of bridging veins. Chronic subdural
haemorrhages may result even in the absence of trauma; elderly patients
with cortical atrophy are predisposed to this type of injury.
In addition to head injury, coma may also complicate any other
condition severe enough to result in circulatory or respiratory
insufficiency.

Headache
The onset of severe headache prior to coma may be caused by trauma,
subarachnoid haemorrhage (classically patients complain of a sudden
onset of blinding headache, the worst ever experienced) or meningitis
(headache associated with photophobia and neck stiffness). Progressive
headache, worse in the mornings and associated with vomiting, may be
due to raised intracranial pressure from a cerebral tumour.

Predisposing factors
The history of possible predisposing factors is useful when assessing the
comatose patient. The presence of diabetes should lead to the
consideration of ketoacidosis (type I diabetics) and hypoglycaemia (oral
hypoglycaemic or insulin dosage errors). Patients with known hepatic
or renal failure may deteriorate to coma as a result of encephalopathy or
uraemia, respectively. Coma may also complicate severe
hypothyroidism. Previous suicide attempts or a history of depression
should lead to the consideration of drug overdose. Epileptic patients
may be in status epilepticus or in a post-ictal recovery state. Pre-existing
cardiac or respiratory disease may result in coma as a terminal event.

[START_SECTION]Examination
Temperature
Body temperature should be recorded and a series of normal body
temperatures will exclude hypothermia and hyperpyrexia as a
consequence of heat stroke or illicit drug use.

General examination
A thorough inspection should be performed. This will necessitate
removal of clothing, log rolling (to examine the back) and a detailed
examination of the scalp for bleeding, haematomas and fractures. The
presence of bilateral periorbital haematomas or cerebrospinal fluid
rhinorrhoea may indicate an anterior fossa fracture of the skull. Bruising
over the mastoid (Battle’s sign) or cerebrospinal fluid otorrhoea may be
due to a middle cranial fossa fracture. Patients with carbon monoxide
poisoning may appear bright red. Patients with myxoedema are
characteristically obese, with coarse features, dry skin and brittle hair.
The arms should be carefully scrutinised for lacerations and needle
puncture sites suggestive of drug abuse and thus the possibility of opiate
overdose. A petechial rash may be visible with meningococcal
meningitis.
The organ systems should be examined in turn; suspect
encephalopathy if signs suggestive of liver disease are present (p. 37) or
uraemia with chronic renal failure. The pulse should be examined for
arrhythmias, which may precipitate cardiac failure. The JVP may also
be elevated. Other causes of JVP distension include tension
pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade, both of which may embarrass
the circulation and precipitate unconsciousness.
Auscultation of the chest may reveal bilateral crepitations with
pulmonary oedema from left ventricular failure, bronchopneumonia,
chronic bronchitis or aspiration.

Neurological examination

[START_SECTION]The neurological examination should begin with the GCS score. Patients
who are not involved in trauma should be assessed for neck stiffness
which may result from meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Trauma patients should have the cervical spine assessed for injury
before any manipulation is undertaken. The pupils should be examined
for size and light reflex. Pinpoint pupils occur with opiate overdoses,
small pupils with brainstem lesions and dilated pupils with cocaine or
amphetamine use, hypoglycaemia, post-ictal states and brainstem death.
A unilateral fixed and dilated pupil occurs with an oculomotor nerve
lesion, which may result from pressure exerted from intracranial
haemorrhage or tumour. Fundoscopy should be performed to identify
loss of retinal vein pulsation or frank papilloedema indicating raised
intracranial pressure. A limited neurological examination can be
performed on comatose patients; this will include assessment of tone,
reflexes and the Babinski response. Unilateral increased tone,
hyperreflexia and an up-going plantar response is indicative of a
contralateral upper motor neurone lesion, such as a stroke, intracranial
haemorrhage or tumour.

General Investigations
■ FBC
↑ WCC with meningitis. Viral meningitis is associated with
lymphocytosis, and neutrophilia is associated with bacterial meningitis.
■ Blood glucose
A bedside blood sugar estimation is very useful to exclude
hypoglycaemia.
■ Urinalysis
Ketones will be present in diabetic ketoacidosis. The urine should also
be sent for toxicology analysis if poisoning is suspected.
■ U&Es
The urea and creatinine is elevated with renal failure. Disorders of
sodium levels will be readily identified.
■ LFTs

[START_SECTION]The bilirubin and transaminases are markedly elevated in liver failure.
■ TFTs
↑ TSH, ↓ T4 with hypothyroidism.
■ Toxicology screen
For cases of suspected poisoning and overdose, serum levels of
salicylates and paracetamol will be helpful in both diagnosis and
treatment. Ethanol levels should also be checked, and
carboxyhaemoglobin levels if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected.
■ ECG
An ECG is useful to diagnose arrhythmia and myocardial infarction (p.
62); either disorder may compromise the circulation.
■ CXR
May reveal pulmonary oedema or lobar consolidation due to infection
or aspiration.
■ X-ray cervical spine
Exclude fracture in traumatic causes of coma.
■ CT
With a history of trauma or clinical signs which suggest head injury, a
CT scan should be requested (this is in preference to a skull X-ray).
Additionally, CT will reveal the presence and location of intracranial
bleeding and tumours.

Specific Investigations
■ Lumbar puncture
A lumbar puncture is performed in cases of suspected meningitis and the
CSF (which may be turbid) is then sent for microscopy and culture.
■ EEG
The EEG is indicated when the diagnosis of epilepsy is suspected. Status
epilepticus, however, should be diagnosed and treated clinically. The
EEG is also useful in the diagnosis of encephalitis.
• Coma is a medical or surgical emergency. The cause must
be identified as rapidly as possible in order to improve the

[START_SECTION]prognosis. Early brain imaging is advised once metabolic
causes have been excluded.

[START_SECTION]Confusion
Confusion is a behavioural state of reduced mental clarity, coherence,
comprehension and reasoning. The causes may be organic or
psychiatric (the reader is referred to a textbook of psychiatry for these
conditions). The organic causes are listed below.

Causes
Toxins/Drugs
• Alcohol intoxication/withdrawal
• Drug intoxication

Hypoxia
• Respiratory disorders
• Cardiac failure

Metabolic Disorder
• Hyperglycaemia/hypoglycaemia
• Electrolyte imbalance, e.g. sodium, calcium
• Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency
• Vitamin B12 deficiency
• Folate deficiency

Systemic Disease
• Renal failure
• Liver failure
• Thyroid disorders

[START_SECTION]Neurological
• Head injuries
• Epilepsy (post-ictal)
• Stroke/TIA
• Cerebral metastasis

Infection
• Respiratory tract infections
• Septicaemia
• Meningitis/encephalitis
• Urinary tract infection

History
Onset
Sudden onset of confusion may be precipitated by head injuries,
epilepsy, stroke and metabolic disorders. Systemic infection, systemic
disease and cerebral metastasis tend to pursue a more gradual onset.

Past medical history
Diabetes is associated with abnormalities of glucose levels with
hyperglycaemia resulting from poor diabetic control and
hypoglycaemia developing due to drug administration error, missing
meals or unaccustomed exercise. A history of thyroid disorder is very
relevant and confusion can result from both hyper- and hypothyroidism
(myxoedema madness). The presence or carcinoma may precipitate
confusion as a result of cerebral metastasis or the development of
hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Encephalopathy is a feature of both liver
failure and thiamine deficiency. Renal disease can lead to confusion
from uraemic encephalopathy or as a result of electrolyte disorders.
Hypoxia may result from cardiac failure and respiratory disease.

[START_SECTION]Confusion associated with folate deficiency. Check for folate in the diet,
alcohol disease, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease,
pregnancy.

Drug history
Both the use and abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepines, barbiturates,
steroids and illicit drugs can result in confusion. A drug history is
especially important in the elderly, as many drugs may precipitate
confusion. Alcohol intoxication and withdrawal (delirium tremens) may
cause confusion.

Associated symptoms
Confusion with associated motor weakness may be due to a stroke or
cerebral metastasis. Sensory deficits may result from thiamine and
vitamin B12 deficiencies. The elderly are particularly susceptible to
confusion precipitated by respiratory or urinary tract infections and
may complain of pyrexia or cough with purulent sputum, or dysuria,
frequency, malodorous urine, pyuria and haematuria, respectively.
Occasionally, myocardial infarction may present as confusion in the
elderly.

Examination
Temperature
The presence of pyrexia is suggestive of an infective aetiology and a
focus for this should be sought.

General
The mental state should be assessed and level of consciousness
documented by a GCS score. Careful inspection may reveal scalp
lacerations, bleeding or haematoma to suggest the presence of head

[START_SECTION]injury. The antecubital forearm veins and groins may have evidence of
needle punctures with intravenous drug abuse.

Systemic examination
Examination of the systems is required to identify general features
suggestive of cardiac, respiratory, liver, renal and thyroid diseases.

Neurological examination
The cranial nerves are examined and the presence of nystagmus may be
due to acute alcohol intoxication, phenytoin toxicity, barbiturate
overdose or cerebellar disease from chronic alcohol abuse. When
nystagmus is associated with ocular palsies and ataxia, it is suggestive
of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, caused by thiamine deficiency.
Isolated cranial nerve abnormalities may also result from meningitis.
The motor system is examined and unilateral upper motor neurone
weakness may be due to stroke or cerebral metastasis. Sensory
neuropathy can result from diabetes, renal failure, alcoholism,
carcinoma, thiamine and vitamin B12 deficiency. With subacute
combined degeneration of the cord from vitamin B12 deficiency, there is
predominant involvement of the posterior columns, with loss of
vibration, proprioception and light touch. Classically, loss of ankle jerks
and an extensor plantar response accompany this.

General Investigations
■ BM stix
↑ or ↓ glucose.
■ Blood glucose
Hypoglycaemia/hyperglycaemia.
■ Oxygen saturation

Cerebral metastasis. Stroke. Head injuries.
■ EEG
Epilepsy.
■ Lumbar puncture
Meningitis.

[START_SECTION]• Acute confusion requires immediate investigation to
exclude metabolic causes. A low threshold for brain imaging
is mandatory, as urgent treatment may be required. Delay in
treatment may have devastating consequences, such as in
stroke or meningococcal meningitis.

[START_SECTION]Constipation
Constipation is a common complaint that results from decreased
frequency of abnormally firm motions for a particular patient. It must be
related to the patient’s normal bowel habit. Acute constipation may be
due to acute intestinal obstruction (p. 252), generalised abdominal
disease, or sudden alteration in routine, e.g. admission to hospital.

Causes
Congenital
• Hirschsprung’s disease

Acquired
Obstruction
• Diverticular disease
• Colonic carcinoma
• Extrinsic compression, e.g. pregnancy, ovarian tumours

Painful Anus
• Fissure-in-ano
• Perianal abscess
• Strangulated haemorrhoids
• Post-haemorrhoidectomy

Adynamic Bowel
• Paralytic ileus
• Spinal cord injury

[START_SECTION]Endocrine
• Diabetes (autonomic neuropathy)
• Myxoedema
• Hyperparathyroidism

Drugs
• Codeine phosphate
• Morphine
• Tricyclic antidepressants
• Atropine
• Laxative abuse

Other
• Dietary changes
• Anxiety/depression
• Irritable bowel syndrome
• Generalised disease
• Starvation

History
Congenital
Hirschsprung’s disease usually presents with constipation from birth.
Gross abdominal distension may eventually occur. The condition may
not be picked up until well into the teens or even early adult life.

Acquired
Obstruction
There may be rapid onset of constipation, although the onset is usually
gradual with the patient complaining of colicky abdominal pain,
bloating, weight loss, lethargy and occasionally spurious diarrhoea.

[START_SECTION]Constipation may occur from pressure from adjacent organs, e.g. with
pregnancy, ovarian cyst or large fibroids. Diverticular disease with or
without stricture may cause constipation.

Painful anus
Patients may become constipated from any anal disorder that results in
pain on defecation. The most common cause is fissure-in-ano, and other
causes include strangulated haemorrhoids (the patient often giving a
past history of haemorrhoids), perianal abscess and
haemorrhoidectomy.

Adynamic bowel
Paralytic ileus may follow abdominal surgery or abdominal
inflammatory conditions. It may also arise following spinal fractures or
prolonged bedrest, especially in the elderly. The patient’s main
complaint is usually of a distended abdomen.

Endocrine
Check for a history of diabetes as diabetic autonomic neuropathy per se
can result in constipation. Myxoedema results in constipation and there
may be associated symptoms of cold intolerance, coarse hair and skin
changes. Hypercalcaemia (e.g. hyperparathyroidism) is associated with
constipation and symptoms include nocturia, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain and mental disturbances.

Drugs
Take a careful drug history. Chronic laxative abuse may make the bowel
‘lazy’ and result in constipation.

Other
Patients with anxiety or depression may complain of constipation.
Symptoms of depression include a change in sleep pattern, waking early
and having difficulty getting back to sleep. With irritable bowel

[START_SECTION]syndrome, the patient may complain of constipation or diarrhoea, or
both alternating. A change in diet alone can also cause constipation, in
patients deliberately trying to lose weight or in those with conditions
associated with reduced food intake. Generalised disease, which affects
the appetite, particularly results in constipation.

Examination
Obstruction
There will be a distended abdomen with obstructive high-pitched
tinkling bowel sounds. The rectum will usually be empty on digital
rectal examination. With a diverticular stricture, there may be
tenderness in the left iliac fossa. With malignancy, a mass may be
palpable in the abdomen.

Painful anus
Inspection of the anus may reveal a chronic fissure-in-ano, strangulated
haemorrhoids, or a perianal abscess. With fissure-in-ano, digital rectal
examination will be extremely painful, if not impossible. Patients who
are post-haemorrhoidectomy may become constipated if appropriate
medication has not been given.

Adynamic bowel
The abdomen will be distended and this is often a painless distension.
Bowel sounds will be absent. There may be signs of recent surgery. A
full neurological examination should be carried out if the cause of the
ileus is not apparent.

Endocrine
With diabetes, there will usually be other complications of diabetes. In
myxoedema, check carefully for other signs, e.g. coarse and dry hair,

[START_SECTION]large tongue, hoarse voice, slow relaxing reflexes.
For any patient with constipation, a digital rectal examination must be
carried out. The rectum may be completely empty with obstruction, or
contain rock-hard faecal masses with functional constipation.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ anaemia associated with bowel carcinoma. WCC ↑ diverticulitis.
ESR ↑ carcinoma.
■ U&Es
Urea ↑ with dehydration with obstructive causes.
■ LFTs
Albumin ↓ in starvation.
■ Sigmoidoscopy
Tumour – biopsy. Hirschsprung’s disease, biopsy – absence of ganglion
cells.
■ AXR
Obstruction – dilated bowel.

Specific Investigations
■ Serum calcium
Hyperparathyroidism.
■ TFTs
T4 ↓, TSH ↑ in myxoedema.
■ Blood glucose
Diabetes – diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
■ Barium enema
Tumours. Diverticular disease.
■ Colonoscopy
Tumours. Biopsy.
■ US
Tumours, ovarian cysts, fibroids, pregnancy.

[START_SECTION]■ MRI
Spinal trauma. Spinal disease.
• In a patient presenting with constipation, a digital rectal
examination is mandatory.
• Constipation is common in the elderly. If it is accompanied
by weight loss, rectal bleeding or mucus discharge,
carcinoma is a likely diagnosis.
• Hirschsprung’s disease does not always present at birth. It
may not be picked up until the child is well into their teens.
Consider the diagnosis in a child with constipation, a
persistently swollen abdomen and an empty rectum on digital
examination.

[START_SECTION]Convulsions
A convulsion is a series of involuntary violent contractions of voluntary
muscles.

Causes
Neurological
• Epilepsy
• Febrile convulsions

Traumatic
• Head injuries

Metabolic
• Hypoxia
• Glucose
• Electrolyte abnormalities, e.g. calcium, sodium
• Uraemia

Vascular
• Cerebral infarction
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage
• Intracranial haemorrhage

Infective
• Meningitis
• Encephalitis
• Cerebral abscess

[START_SECTION]Neoplastic
• Brain tumours

Toxin/Drug-Induced
• Alcoholism/withdrawal
• Amphetamines, cocaine, antipsychotics, ‘ecstasy’
• Mefenamic acid overdose

Other
• Neurosurgery
• Pseudo seizures

History
Event
When evaluating patients with convulsions, it is also important to
exclude the causes of syncope (p. 443). An accurate description from an
observer is invaluable for documentation and may help in differentiating
the forms of epileptic seizures. A prodrome or aura may be associated
with the onset of a seizure.

Precipitating factors
The history should start with precipitating factors, e.g. causes such as
trauma, surgery, or drug overdose. Flashing lights may precipitate a
seizure in patients with a past history of epilepsy.

Headache
Convulsions associated with headaches may be due to trauma,
subarachnoid haemorrhage, meningitis or raised intracranial pressure
from a tumour. Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage may also

[START_SECTION]complain of sudden onset of blinding headache. The headache
associated with meningitis is often accompanied with neck stiffness and
photophobia. In the presence of raised intracranial pressure, the
headache tends to be worse in the mornings and on coughing or
sneezing. It may be associated with nausea or vomiting. For a fuller
description, see p. 221.

Associated neurology
Pre-existing neurological impairment before the onset of convulsions
has important implications. A stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage or
intracranial bleed may precipitate neurological impairment preceding a
convulsion. Chronic progressive impairment preceding a seizure may be
a result of tumour growth. In the post-ictal period, transient motor
weakness may accompany epilepsy (Todd’s palsy). Permanent
neurological deficit can be induced by cerebral anoxia from prolonged
seizures.

Past medical and drug history
Co-existing disease such as diabetes will predispose to abnormalities of
serum glucose concentrations. A drug history should be obtained and
specific enquiries undertaken regarding illicit drug use. Alcohol
consumption should be documented. In epileptics, poor drug compliance
may lead to seizure control failure.

Examination
Temperature
The presence of pyrexia usually suggests an infective aetiology, such as
meningitis or cerebral abscess. Examination should also be undertaken
to look for the primary focus, such as otitis media or mastoiditis.
Convulsions may result as a complication of a pyrexia alone, especially
in children.

[START_SECTION]General examination
A general examination is performed to look for the presence of head
injury and also any damage resulting as a consequence of the
convulsion.

Neurological examination
The primary aim of a neurological examination following a convulsion
is to determine the presence of residual neurological deficit. The
neurological assessment should include mental state and higher cortical
function. If an abnormality is detected, the location may be determined
by clinical examination to allow focussed investigation. However,
neurological abnormalities present immediately after a seizure, may
resolve completely. Todd’s palsy may occur post-ictally.

General Investigations
■ BM stix
Rapid assessment for hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia.
■ FBC
WCC ↑ meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral abscess.
■ U&Es
↑ or ↓ sodium, ↑ urea and creatinine – renal failure.
■ Serum calcium
↑ or ↓ calcium.
■ Blood glucose
↑ or ↓ glucose.
■ ABGs
Hypoxia.
■ CT or MRI head
Especially in the presence of neurological deficit. Cerebral tumours –
alterations in brain density. Skull fractures. Intracranial bleeding – highdensity signal during the first two weeks. Subarachnoid haemorrhage –
high signal (blood) in the subarachnoid space. Strokes – infarction

[START_SECTION]appears normal in the first 24 hours.

Specific Investigations
■ Toxicology screen
Drug use.
■ EEG
Epilepsy.
■ Lumbar puncture
Meningitis.
• Metabolic causes of convulsions must be excluded
immediately. Brain imaging is indicated if the cause is not
easily identified, as delay in treatment may result in a poor
prognosis.

[START_SECTION]Cough
Cough is a reflex explosive expiration that prevents aspiration and
promotes the removal of secretions and foreign particles from the lung.

Causes
Acute
• Inhaled foreign body
• Respiratory tract infection

Chronic
Productive
• COPD (mucoid/purulent)
• TB (bloodstained) • (common where TB is endemic)
• Bronchiectasis (purulent)
• Pulmonary oedema (pink, frothy)
• Lung cancer (bloodstained) (Fig. 12)
• Pulmonary embolism (bloodstained)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 12 CT thorax showing a left lower lobe non-small-cell
lung cancer revealed as a peripheral cavitating mass (arrow).
The patient presented with cough and haemoptysis.

Non-Productive
• Asthma
• Post-nasal drip
• Gastro-oesophageal reflux
• Drugs (ACE inhibitors)
• Sarcoidosis

History
Onset and duration
The onset of a cough may be acute or chronic (usually defined as a
cough that has persisted for more than three weeks). Sudden onset of an
unrelenting bout of violent coughing may be due to an inhaled foreign
body. If this is large enough to occlude the airway, coughing abruptly
ceases and is supervened by cyanosis and eventually unconsciousness.

Sputum
The frequency, quantity and appearance of expectorated sputum can be
very helpful in the differential diagnosis. Cough continuously productive
of purulent sputum is suggestive of chronic bronchitis and
bronchiectasis. Expectorated bloodstained sputum tends to be a
complaint of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, pulmonary
embolism and TB.

[START_SECTION]Smoking history
Smoking alone may cause a chronic cough; however, a long smoking
history predisposes to bronchogenic carcinoma and chronic bronchitis.

Associated symptoms
Episodic (or even seasonal) wheezing with shortness of breath is
common with asthma. This should be differentiated from the
monophonic wheeze, which is suggestive of intraluminal obstruction
from foreign bodies or tumour.
Most of the respiratory causes of coughing tend to be accompanied by
shortness of breath, but sudden onset of dyspnoea may result from
aspiration or pulmonary embolism. Shortness of breath that is worse on
recumbency is suggestive of pulmonary oedema; however, asthma may
also be worse at night. Weight loss can be a prominent feature with lung
tumours and TB.
Pleuritic chest pain may be experienced with pulmonary emboli and
pneumonia; unrelenting chest pain is more suggestive of bony
metastasis from lung cancer. Retrosternal burning chest pain
precipitated by posture suggests gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and
the associated cough is due to aspiration of refluxed material. Frequent
clearing of the throat due to nasal discharge or a history of allergy with
rhinitis may result in post-nasal drip and precipitate coughing.

Examination
Temperature
The presence of pyrexia usually indicates an infective aetiology; the
temperature may also be raised with pulmonary embolism.

Inspection and palpation

[START_SECTION]With COPD, the chest may be barrel-shaped. Patients suffering with
lung cancer or TB may appear cachectic. Cyanosis is a feature of
pulmonary embolism and COPD. The fingers should be inspected for
clubbing (p. 64), which is associated with bronchial carcinoma and
bronchiectasis. The JVP is raised in congestive cardiac failure. The
supraclavicular nodes may be palpable with respiratory tract infections,
TB and lung cancer.

Auscultation
On auscultation, coarse crepitations are a feature of bronchiectasis and
pulmonary oedema. Auscultatory features of bronchial carcinoma are
non-specific and may manifest as a pleural effusion (dull to percussion,
absent breath sounds, decreased vocal resonance) or segmental collapse
of the lung. Widespread wheezing is suggestive of asthma, and a fixed
inspiratory wheeze may be heard with bronchial luminal obstruction.

General Investigations
■ Sputum cultures
If a productive cough is present, sputum should be sent for cultures. This
will include TB-specific cultures and Ziehl–Neelsen staining.
■ Peak flow
Bedside determination of peak expiratory flow rate is useful in the
diagnosis of asthma (low peak flow).
■ WCC
A raised WCC is a non-specific indicator of infection, as it may also be
raised with pulmonary embolism.
■ CXR
Very useful and may reveal areas of consolidation with infection.
Dilated bronchi with persistent areas of infection are suggestive of
bronchiectasis. Apical pulmonary consolidation with calcification and
hilar lymphadenopathy is characteristic of TB. The presence of
pulmonary oedema is appreciated by bilateral patchy shadowing; this

[START_SECTION]may be accompanied by other radiological features of cardiac failure,
including cardiomegaly, upper lobe diversion of the pulmonary veins,
bilateral pleural effusions and Kerley B lines (1–2 cm horizontal lines in
the periphery of the lung fields). Bronchial carcinoma may present as a
hilar mass, peripheral mass or with collapse and consolidation of the
lung due to airway obstruction. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is
suggestive of sarcoidosis.
■ Respiratory function tests
Formal respiratory function tests can be used to diagnose airway
obstruction (asthma, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis) and flow
volume loops may reveal fixed airway obstruction.

Specific Investigations
■ V/Q scan
Indicated when the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected
(especially where CXR is normal).
■ Pulmonary angiography
May be indicated in severely ill patients with suspected pulmonary
embolism when surgery or thrombolysis is being considered.
■ CT thorax
Useful for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer; it is also specific for
the diagnosis of bronchiectasis.
■ pH studies
24-hour pH monitoring may be required when a diagnosis of gastrooesophageal reflux disease cannot be made on the history alone.
• Persistent cough, weight loss and hoarseness in a smoker
are ominous signs. Arrange a CXR to exclude malignancy.
• An unrelenting bout of violent coughing of sudden onset
may be due to an inhaled foreign body. If this is large enough
to occlude the upper airways, coughing may cease abruptly
and cyanosis and unconsciousness ensue. Cricothyroidotomy
may be life-saving.

[START_SECTION]• Ask about foreign travel, especially to countries where TB is
endemic.

[START_SECTION]Cyanosis
Cyanosis is the abnormal blue discoloration of the skin and mucous
membranes resulting from the presence of 5 g/dL or more of reduced
haemoglobin in the blood. It is not synonymous with hypoxaemia,
which may be present (e.g. anaemia) without cyanosis.

Causes
Central Cyanosis
Decreased Oxygen Saturation
• Severe respiratory disease
• Pulmonary oedema
• Pulmonary embolism
• Congenital cyanotic heart disease

Abnormal Haemoglobin
• Methaemoglobinaemia
• Sulphaemoglobinaemia

Peripheral Cyanosis
• All causes of central cyanosis
• Cold exposure
• Raynaud’s phenomenon
• Arterial occlusion
• Venous occlusion
• Acrocyanosis

[START_SECTION]History
Central cyanosis
Onset
Cyanosis due to congenital heart disease causing anatomical right to left
shunts may have been present from birth or the first few years of life.
Immediate onset of cyanosis may be due to pulmonary emboli or
cardiac failure. Acute onset of cyanosis may be precipitated by
pneumonia and asthma. Patients with COPD develop cyanosis over
many years. Accompanying polycythaemia may exacerbate cyanosis in
these patients.

Chest pain
Cyanosis associated with pleuritic chest pain may be due to pulmonary
emboli or pneumonia. Dull, aching chest tightness is experienced by
patients who develop cyanosis from pulmonary oedema as a
complication of myocardial infarction.

Dyspnoea
Sudden onset of dyspnoea can occur with pulmonary emboli and
pulmonary oedema, while conditions such as asthma may produce a
more gradual onset.

Past medical history and drug history
Any co-existing respiratory disease is significant, as cyanosis can result
from any lung disease of sufficient severity. Consumption of drugs such
as phenacetin and sulphonamides may precipitate
methaemoglobinaemia and sulphaemoglobinaemia, respectively.

Peripheral cyanosis
General history

[START_SECTION]Acrocyanosis is a condition in which the hands are persistently blue and
cold; it is not associated with pain. Raynaud’s phenomenon is the
episodic three-colour change that occurs, with arterial vasospasm
(white), cyanosis (blue) and reactive hyperaemia (red). It may be
idiopathic or be associated with connective tissue diseases and drugs
such as beta blockers.
Peripheral cyanosis may also result from acute arterial occlusion and
is accompanied by pain and mottling of the skin. Iliofemoral deep
venous thrombosis can produce a painful blue leg, termed phlegmasia
cerulea dolens.

Examination
Temperature
Pneumonia and pulmonary emboli may be associated with pyrexia.

Inspection
It is often difficult to detect minor degrees of cyanosis. Central cyanosis
produces a blue discoloration of the mucous membranes and digits;
peripheral cyanosis produces blue discoloration only of the digits.
Episodic peripheral cyanosis may be due to Raynaud’s disease and this
may be associated with small areas of infarction on the fingertips. The
presence of clubbing may be due to congenital cyanotic heart disease.
Classically, patients with chronic bronchitis appear cyanosed with a
poorly expanding barrelled chest. The JVP is elevated with congestive
cardiac failure.

Respiratory examination
Poor chest expansion occurs with chronic bronchitis and asthma.
Unilateral impairment of expansion may occur with lobar pneumonia;
in addition, dullness to percussion is experienced over the area of
consolidation. Localised crepitation may be auscultated with lobar

[START_SECTION]pneumonia, but is more widespread with bronchopneumonia,
pulmonary oedema and chronic bronchitis. Air entry is poor with
chronic bronchitis and asthma. Bronchial breathing may be auscultated
over an area of consolidation, and additional sounds, such as wheezing,
may be heard with asthma.

General Investigations
■ Oxygen saturation
Saturation is usually below 85% with cyanosis (unless
methaemoglobinaemia where saturation is normal).
■ ABGs
↓ pO2 all severe lung disease.
■ FBC
Hb ↑ chronic cyanosis. WCC ↑ pneumonia and pulmonary embolism.
■ ECG
Features of myocardial infarction (p. 62). Non-specific abnormalities
with pulmonary emboli.
■ CXR
Pneumonia, pulmonary infarct, cardiac failure (p. 61).

Specific Investigations
■ Sputum and blood cultures
Pneumonia.
■ V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiography
Pulmonary embolus.
■ Echocardiography
Cardiac failure.
■ Hb spectroscopy
Methaemoglobinaemia, sulphaemoglobinaemia.
■ Digital subtraction angiography
Acute arterial occlusion.
■ Duplex Doppler or venography

[START_SECTION]Acute venous occlusion.
• The sudden development of cyanosis is an emergency and
causes for this, such as pulmonary embolus and pulmonary
oedema, must be identified immediately.
• Arterial occlusion as a cause of peripheral cyanosis must
also be recognised and acted on urgently.

[START_SECTION]Deafness
Deafness is loss of hearing and may be divided into ‘conductive’ and
‘sensorineural’ to facilitate interpretation of clinical examination.

Causes
Conductive Deafness
Congenital
• Atresia of the meatus

Acquired
• Obstruction
• Ear wax
• Foreign body
• Infection
• Otitis externa
• Otitis media (including glue ear)
• Trauma
• Perforation of the tympanic membrane
• Barotrauma
• Otosclerosis

Sensorineural Deafness
Congenital
• Maternal rubella, toxoplasmosis, CMV infection

Acquired

[START_SECTION]• Age-related (presbyacusis)
• Ménière’s disease
• Infection
• Mumps
• Herpes zoster
• Meningitis
• Trauma
• Noise-induced
• Head injuries
• Drugs
• Aminoglycosides, aspirin, frusemide
• Tumour
• Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma)
• Brain tumours
• Paget’s disease (see p. 47)

History
Duration
Childhood deafness may be hereditary, result from maternal rubella
infection or arise as a complication of childhood infection (meningitis,
toxoplasma or CMV infection). The duration of symptoms may coincide
with the introduction of ototoxic drugs.

Onset
Sudden onset of deafness can result from foreign bodies in the external
auditory canal. Deafness usually occurs only if the foreign body
perforates the tympanic membrane or disrupts the chain of ossicles.
Sudden onset of deafness may also result from trauma, vascular
catastrophes or Ménière’s disease. Gradual development of deafness
occurs with otosclerosis, tumours and age.

[START_SECTION]Pain
Deafness associated with ear pain may be a result of otitis externa, otitis
media or infection with herpes zoster. Severe pain is experienced with
both direct trauma perforating the tympanic membrane and barotrauma,
which can result from a slap on the ear or scuba diving.

Precipitating factors
A history of trauma is usually obvious. Sensorineural deafness can
result as a complication of mumps or from prolonged exposure to high
noise levels.

Associated symptoms
Tinnitus in combination with episodic deafness and vertigo occur with
Ménière’s disease. When tinnitus occurs with deafness alone, consider
otosclerosis, noise exposure, ototoxic drugs or acoustic neuroma.

Drug history
Offending drugs can easily be determined from a drug history.

Examination
Examination of the ear
On inspection, the vesicles of herpes zoster or presence of otitis externa
may be obvious. With otitis externa, the skin appears erythematous with
scaling and exudation. Tenderness will be elicited by movement of the
pinna or compression of the tragus.
Otoscopic examination will identify ear wax or foreign bodies
occluding the external auditory canal. With a patent ear canal, the
tympanic membrane may be visualised, traumatic perforations may be
seen as a tear of the tympanum accompanied with blood. Injection,

[START_SECTION]erythema or frank perforation of the tympanic membrane can result
from otitis media.

Assessment of hearing
Crude tests of hearing can be performed with conversational voice,
whispered voice or measuring how far away from the ear the ticking of
a watch can be heard.
Rinne’s test is performed with a 512-Hz tuning fork; mastoid or BC is
compared with AC. AC conduction is normally better than BC. Weber’s
test is performed holding the base of the struck tuning fork against the
centre of the forehead. Normally, the sound is heard equally in both ears
(see Table).
Deafness

General examination
A complete neurological examination is performed. Nystagmus may be
present with Ménière’s disease; rarely acoustic neuromas may affect the
facial nerve, producing unilateral facial paralysis; and motor or sensory
deficits can result from brain tumours. Examination should also include
the nose and throat, as nasopharyngeal sepsis may be a factor
predisposing to middle ear infection.

General Investigations
■ Pure tone audiometry
Allows accurate measurements of hearing levels with bone and air
conduction.
■ Swab of ear discharge
In cases of possible infection.

Specific Investigations

[START_SECTION]Specific Investigations
■ Speech audiometry
Impaired speech discrimination in the 50–80% range occurs with
conductive deafness, and 0–50% range with sensorineural causes.
■ Electric response audiometry
Assessment of hearing in babies.
■ Impedance tympanometry
Increased impedance (reduced compliance) with otitis media with
effusion.
■ MRI
Acoustic neuroma, brain tumour.
• Progressive unilateral deafness accompanied by tinnitus,
vertigo or neurological symptoms or signs should prompt
urgent investigation for an acoustic neuroma.

[START_SECTION]Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is an increased frequency of abnormally loose motions. The
diagnosis of diarrhoea must be related to the patient’s normal bowel
habit.

History
Infective enteritis
There is usually colicky abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The diarrhoea
may be bloody. Cholera presents with cramping abdominal pain,
vomiting and severe diarrhoea, described as ‘rice water’ stools. There
may be fever, rapid dehydration, collapse and death. In infective
enteritis, check for ingestion of any unusual food or whether anyone else
has been affected in the family. Check for a history of foreign travel

[START_SECTION](traveller’s diarrhoea). C. difficile is the most important cause of hospitalacquired diarrhoea. Over 80% of infection occurs in those over 65 years
of age, affecting particularly those who have been treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics. Infection ranges from mild to severe diarrhoea to
more, unusually, pseudomembranous colitis.

Inflammatory bowel disease
Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis present with frequent
diarrhoea with blood, and occasionally mucus and pus, associated with
colicky abdominal pain. The patient may be toxic and febrile, with
abdominal pain and distension if toxic dilatation of the colon has
occurred.

Malabsorption
In addition to diarrhoea, there may be offensive stools, which are fatty
and float, i.e. steatorrhoea. Has the patient had any previous surgery for
resection of the bowel to suggest short bowel syndrome, or any bypass
surgery to suggest blind loop syndrome? Is there any history of
abdominal radiotherapy?

Neoplastic
Carcinoma may cause diarrhoea associated with colicky abdominal
pain and the passage of blood and mucus PR. The diarrhoea may be
spurious, liquefied stools only passing through an area of obstruction,
with faecal masses behind the obstruction. Loose watery mucus passed
frequently may be associated with a villous adenoma, the patient
complaining of weakness associated with hypokalaemia due to the
passage of excessive mucus rich in potassium.

Other intestinal
Diverticular disease may cause diarrhoea. The condition usually occurs

[START_SECTION]in the older patient. The patient will also complain of associated colicky
abdominal pain and pain usually in the left iliac fossa. Irritable bowel
syndrome may cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease but
occurs in the younger patient. Faecal impaction may result in spurious
diarrhoea, while an ileocolic fistula associated with diverticular disease
or rectosigmoid carcinoma is also associated with diarrhoea. Ischaemic
colitis usually presents in an elderly patient with colicky abdominal
pain, diarrhoea and passage of dark-red blood PR.

Gastric
Check for a history of gastric surgery. Destruction of the pylorus or
section of the vagus nerve may result in diarrhoea, often associated with
dumping. Vagotomy is rarely, if ever, performed nowadays.

Pancreatic lesions
These may result in diarrhoea or steatorrhoea. Check for a history of
cystic fibrosis. The patient may have chronic pancreatitis, in which case
there may be chronic back pain associated with epigastric pain and
weight loss. Check for a history of pancreatic surgery. Patients with
carcinoma of the pancreas may also present with diarrhoea.

Endocrine disorders
Diabetes is associated with an increased incidence of diarrhoea. Check
for a history of thyroid disease. The patient may prefer cold weather and
complain of sweating, anxiety, tremor and have obvious eye signs. The
patient may also have noticed a goitre. Carcinoid syndrome may present
as flushing (especially after alcohol, coffee and certain foods), asthma
and loud bowel sounds, i.e. borborygmi. Patients with Zollinger–Ellison
syndrome may have a past history of recurrent peptic ulceration, with
haematemesis or melaena, in addition to diarrhoea. VIPoma is rare but
presents with severe watery diarrhoea associated with potassium loss,
with weakness due to hypokalaemia. Check whether the patient has a

[START_SECTION]goitre, as diarrhoea may be associated with medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid. Symptoms and signs of hyperparathyroidism and
phaeochromocytoma may also be present (MEN syndrome).

Drugs
Take a careful drug history, especially for recent antibiotics, laxative
abuse, proton pump inhibitors, sorbitol (in sugar-free foods), the
ingestion of magnesium-containing antacids or recent cytotoxic agents.

Other
Anxiety and dietary changes may lead to diarrhoea. A careful history
should be taken, particularly looking at any recent changes in the diet.

Examination
Infective enteritis
The patient may be dehydrated or collapsed. Check for tachycardia and
hypotension. There may be abdominal tenderness and distension.
Digital rectal examination may reveal blood and pus on the examining
glove.

Inflammatory bowel disease
There may be little to find except for mild, localised tenderness. In toxic
dilatation, there will be fever, malaise, abdominal distension, vomiting
and localised tenderness. Perforation may occur with peritonitis. An
abdominal mass may be palpable with Crohn’s disease.

Neoplastic
There may be abdominal distension if obstruction has occurred. There
may be a palpable abdominal mass. Digital rectal examination may

[START_SECTION]reveal a carcinoma or a villous adenoma.

Other intestinal
With diverticular disease, there may be little to find other than
tenderness in the left iliac fossa. The findings are similar in irritable
bowel syndrome. With faecal impaction, rock-hard faecal masses may
be palpated in the abdomen and may be felt on digital rectal
examination. There may be little to find with an ileocolic fistula. With
ischaemic colitis, there will be tenderness and guarding in the left side
of the abdomen. Rectal examination will reveal dark-red blood.

Gastric
Other than a scar and history of gastric surgery, there may be nothing
else to find on examination.

Pancreatic
With pancreatic carcinoma, there may be epigastric tenderness or a
palpable mass in the epigastrium.

Endocrine
With thyrotoxicosis, there will be tachycardia, sweating, brisk reflexes,
eye signs and a goitre. With carcinoid syndrome, there may be
hepatomegaly and signs of tricuspid incompetence and pulmonary
stenosis. In Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, there may be little to find on
examination. With VIPoma, other than weakness due to hypokalaemia,
there may also be little to find on examination. With medullary
carcinoma of the thyroid, there will be a palpable goitre.

• It is important to distinguish diarrhoea from steatorrhoea
and faecal incontinence.
• Do not be caught out by overflow (‘spurious’) diarrhoea in
the elderly. Always do a PR.

[START_SECTION]Dizziness
Spatial disorientation may be expressed by the patient as dizziness,
vertigo or feeling ‘light-headed’. True vertigo is not experienced as a
sensation of movement but as tilting or sloping of the environment.

Causes
Episodic
• Ménière’s disease*
• BPPV
• Arrhythmia
• Postural hypotension
• Migraine
• Hyperventilation
• Drugs (antihypertensives, antidepressants)
• Hypoglycaemia
• Recurrent posterior circulation TIAs
• Anxiety
• Seizures (partial)
• Carbon monoxide poisoning (e.g. faulty heating)

Constant
Acute Onset
• Labyrinthitis*
• Acute alcohol or drug intoxication
• Head injuries*
• Vestibular neuronitis

[START_SECTION]• Posterior circulation CVA

Gradual Onset
• Multiple sclerosis
• Aortic stenosis
• Cerebellopontine angle tumour*
• Ototoxicity – aminoglycosides*
*Indicates causes accompanied by audiological symptoms.

History
General
The causes above are listed according to speed of onset and duration of
symptoms. Conditions that are accompanied by additional audiological
symptoms, such as tinnitus, are marked with an asterisk.

Precipitating factors
Causes of dizziness that are precipitated by movements of the head
include BPPV, labyrinthitis and head injuries. Patients with BPPV
complain of short episodes of dizziness accompanying changes in the
position of the head. Labyrinthitis may result either as a complication of
systemic viral infection or from extension of a cholesteatoma due to
chronic suppurative otitis media. A history of trauma is usually obvious.
Postural dizziness precipitated by rising from a lying position may be
caused by orthostatic hypotension commonly secondary to
antihypertensive drugs.

Associated symptoms
Dizziness may be precipitated by arrhythmia and patients may
complain of associated palpitations. It may also be experienced with

[START_SECTION]migraine attacks and patients may complain of associated unilateral
throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting and photophobia. Ménière’s
disease is diagnosed with a history of episodic severe vertigo with
continuous tinnitus and hearing loss. Patients with vertebrobasilar
insufficiency from cervical spondylosis may complain of dizziness with
extension of the neck. With posterior circulation TIAs, sudden onset of
dizziness is caused by ischaemia of the lateral brainstem or cerebellum.
This may be accompanied by syncope, nausea, vomiting, visual field
defects and diplopia. Severe progressive vomiting and ataxia may also
result from intracerebellar haemorrhage – a neurosurgical emergency.
Patients with anxiety disorders may experience attacks of dizziness,
tinnitus and tremor, with or without accompanying hyperventilation.
Certainly, hyperventilation alone is sufficient to precipitate dizziness.
Vertigo is a prominent feature of multiple sclerosis when demyelination
occurs in the brainstem; this may be accompanied by dysarthria and
cranial nerve palsies. Young age would favour the diagnosis of
demyelination over ischaemia. Tumours of the cerebellopontine angle
tend to present gradually, dizziness may be mild and this may be
accompanied by numbness and facial paralysis due to trigeminal and
facial nerve involvement. There are no precipitating factors for
vestibular neuronitis; the dizziness is not associated with nausea or
tinnitus.

Drug history
Numerous drugs have ototoxic effects; perhaps the most commonly
known are aminoglycosides and frusemide.

Examination
Assessment of nystagmus, hearing and positional testing provide most
information when determining the cause of dizziness.
Multidirectional nystagmus results from diffuse cerebellar disease,
while unidirectional nystagmus occurs either with ipsilateral cerebellar
disease (multiple sclerosis, posterior circulation TIA/CVA) or

[START_SECTION]contralateral vestibular disease (Ménière’s, labyrinthitis, acoustic
neuroma). On lateral gaze, nystagmus of the abducting eye with failure
of adduction of the opposite eye, is due to internuclear ophthalmoplegia,
classically caused by brainstem demyelination.
Hearing is assessed with Rinne’s and Weber’s tests (p. 96).
Sensorineural hearing loss may be caused by Ménière’s, acoustic
neuroma and drug-induced ototoxicity. Hearing loss accompanied by
trigeminal and facial nerve palsy may be due to tumour effects at the
cerebellopontine angle.
Specific positional tests, such as the Hallpike test, are performed to
assess the integrity of the vestibulo-ocular and labyrinthine pathways.
Patients with BPPV usually complain of vertigo and exhibit delayed
nystagmus that fatigues on repeated testing.
A complete neurological examination is then undertaken.
Homonymous hemianopia can result from posterior circulation infarcts
and brainstem lesions such as demyelination, and stroke may give rise
to combinations of ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies and motor or sensory
deficits of the face. In addition, pale optic discs due to optic atrophy may
be seen in multiple sclerosis. Patients with cerebellar disease will
exhibit an intention tremor when performing the finger–nose test. In
addition to a broad-based ataxic gait, they may also exhibit nystagmus,
dysdiadochokinesia and dysarthria.
When a cardiovascular cause is suspected, the pulse is assessed for
irregularities of rhythm, which may suggest atrial fibrillation. The
blood pressure is measured both lying and standing to screen for
postural hypotension, and potential sites for emboli, such as the cardiac
valves and the carotid vessels, are auscultated for murmurs and bruits,
respectively. Severe aortic stenosis may lead to dizziness.

General Investigations
Most causes of dizziness can be diagnosed on history and clinical
examination.
■ FBC

[START_SECTION]Hb ↑ predisposes to CVA. WCC ↑ infection.
■ ESR
↑ CVA, malignancy, infection.
■ Urinalysis
Raised glucose in diabetes.
■ LFTs
May be abnormal in alcohol abuse.
■ Thiamine
Reduced in chronic alcohol abuse.

Specific Investigations
■ 24-hour ECG
To screen for arrhythmia.
■ Audiometry
Allows assessment and classification of any accompanying hearing
loss.
■ Carotid Doppler
To evaluate patency of the vessel and to screen for the presence of
plaque (TIAs).
■ ECHO
To evaluate aortic valve.
■ CT head
Stroke, cerebellar haemorrhage, evaluation of severe head injuries.
■ MRI
Acoustic neuroma and other cerebellopontine angle tumours,
demyelination with multiple sclerosis.
■ EEG
To detect seizure activity.
• Dizziness accompanied by other symptoms such as loss of
consciousness, palpitations or neurological symptoms should
be investigated immediately.
• Dizziness associated with an aortic murmur requires urgent

[START_SECTION]referral. Significant aortic stenosis is a cause of sudden death.

[START_SECTION]Dysphagia
Dysphagia means difficulty in swallowing and should be distinguished
from pain on swallowing. Dysphagia may be associated with ingestion
of solids or liquids, or both. Pain on swallowing is odynophagia, which
in itself does not interfere with the act of swallowing.

Causes

[START_SECTION]History
Congenital
Oesophageal atresia
This may be associated with maternal polyhydramnios. The newborn
baby will show dribbling of saliva, inability to swallow feeds,
production of frothy mucus, choking attacks, cyanotic attacks and chest
infections.

Acquired
In the lumen
There may be a history of ingestion of a foreign body such as a coin
(children) or false teeth (elderly). Occasionally the history may not be
forthcoming. In the case of a food bolus, it is unusual for this to cause
dysphagia without there being some form of underlying stricture.

In the wall
With a caustic stricture, there is usually a history of caustic ingestion,
except in the psychiatrically disturbed, where the history may not be
apparent. There will be sudden onset of pain and dysphagia, which may
improve with appropriate treatment only to recur after several months
due to a stricture. Patients with inflammatory stricture due to gastrooesophageal reflux associated with a hiatus hernia will have a history of
retrosternal burning pain and acid reflux, which is worse on
recumbency or bending down. The dysphagia is usually of gradual onset
and the patient may localise the site of dysphagia to the level of the
lower end of the sternum. Oesophageal candidiasis may cause
dysphagia and this usually occurs in the immunocompromised patient.
Achalasia is a disorder where there is degeneration of the oesophageal

[START_SECTION]myenteric plexus resulting in loss of peristaltic contraction in the
oesophagus and failure of the lower oesophageal sphincter to relax in
response to swallowing. It usually presents between 30 and 50 years of
age. The dysphagia may be intermittent and then gets progressively
worse. It may be worse for liquids than for solids. Fluid regurgitation at
night may result in aspiration pneumonitis. With carcinoma, the
dysphagia is usually of rapid onset. Initially, it is for solids, then for
fluids. There may be associated weight loss, anorexia and symptoms of
anaemia. There may be a history of achalasia or Barrett’s oesophagus.
Dysphagia with food sticking at the upper end of the oesophagus in a
middle-aged woman may suggest Plummer–Vinson syndrome. This is
due to a web in the upper oesophagus (post-cricoid web). The condition
is pre-malignant. A history of radiotherapy to chest or mediastinum
may suggest an irradiation stricture. With scleroderma, the patient may
have noticed changes in the skin, around the lips, in the fingers
(sclerodactyly) or may have a past history of Raynaud’s phenomenon.
Chagas’ disease is extremely rare and is associated with degeneration of
the myenteric plexus associated with trypanosomal infection. The
symptoms are identical to those of achalasia.

Outside the wall
The presence of a large goitre will be obvious. With the pharyngeal
pouch, patients are usually of middle age or elderly. They may have
noticed a swelling, usually in the left posterior triangle of the neck. They
may also have dysphagia localised behind the manubrium associated
with the pouch pressing on the oesophagus. On lying down, there is
regurgitation of food with coughing. The patient may also have
halitosis. With bronchial carcinoma, there may be direct pressure on the
oesophagus from the tumour or via secondary spread to the mediastinal
lymph nodes. There may be a history of bronchial carcinoma or the
patient may present with haemoptysis. With dysphagia from
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the patient may have noticed enlarged
swellings at other sites, e.g. axilla or groin. Dysphagia from pressure of
an enlarged left atrium may be associated with mitral stenosis and there

[START_SECTION]may be a past history of this. With a paraoesophageal (rolling) hernia,
the dysphagia may be intermittent, due to a full stomach pressing on the
adjacent oesophagus. Hiccups may occur due to irritation of the
diaphragm.

Neuromuscular
There will usually be a history of Guillain–Barré syndrome,
poliomyelitis, motor neurone disease, myasthenia gravis or a CVA.

Others
Globus is a subjective feeling of a lump or foreign body in the throat.
The term ‘globus hystericus’ was previously used because it was felt to
be psychogenic but it is now considered that a globus sensation may
still indicate organic pathology. Investigation is required to exclude the
true causes of dysphagia.

Examination
With oesophageal atresia, an orogastric tube is passed and it will arrest
at the site of the obstruction.
In many cases of dysphagia, there will be nothing to find on
examination. A goitre is usually an obvious swelling that moves on
swallowing. With a pharyngeal pouch, there may be a palpable swelling
low down in the posterior triangle of the neck (usually left), which
gurgles on palpation. With carcinoma, there may be signs of weight
loss, a palpable liver due to metastases, or cervical lymphadenopathy
due to metastases. Koilonychia, angular cheilitis and glossitis are
clinical features associated with Plummer–Vinson syndrome. With
irradiation stricture, there may be changes in the skin consistent with
previous radiotherapy. With scleroderma, there may be calcinosis of the
subcutaneous tissue, Raynaud’s phenomenon, sclerodactyly and
telangiectasia. With dysphagia, due to an enlarged left atrium in mitral
stenosis, there may be signs of mitral stenosis, e.g. peripheral cyanosis,
malar flush, left parasternal heave, tapping apex beat, opening snap and

[START_SECTION]mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the apex. A variety of neurological
abnormalities will be associated with dysphagia of neuromuscular
origin.

• Aspiration
• Anxiety
• Pulmonary oedema
• Pulmonary embolism
• Anaphylaxis

FIGURE 15 A pneumothorax, visible on the right side.
Note the absence of lung markings at the periphery. The lung edge is

[START_SECTION]Acute (Hours to Days)
• Asthma
• Respiratory tract infection
• Pleural effusion
• Lung tumours
• Metabolic acidosis

Chronic (Months To Years)
• Chronic airflow limitation (COPD)
• Anaemia
• Arrhythmia
• Valvular heart disease
• Cardiac failure
• Cystic fibrosis
• Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
• Chest wall deformities
• Neuromuscular disorders
• Pulmonary hypertension

History
Many cardiac or respiratory diseases of sufficient severity produce
dyspnoea. When considering chronic respiratory causes, you may relate
them anatomically to diseases of the pulmonary vasculature, airways,
interstitium and chest wall. When approaching a patient with dyspnoea,
it is important to ensure that the ABC are attended to before continuing
with the diagnostic process.

Onset
The speed of onset is a useful indicator of the disease process.
Classification by speed of onset narrows the differential diagnosis in

[START_SECTION]urgent clinical situations.

Precipitating factors
An obvious precipitating factor may be present, such as trauma causing
either fractured ribs or a pneumothorax. Aspiration of a foreign body
may be determined from the history; however, aspiration of vomit is
more difficult, as it usually occurs in patients with decreased
consciousness levels or who have lost the gag reflex. Dyspnoea on
recumbency is caused by cardiac failure; occasionally patients may
complain of waking up at night gasping for breath when they slide
down the pillows (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea). Dyspnoea
associated with asthma may be seasonal (grass pollen) or perennial
(house-dust mite faecal proteins), depending on the precipitating
allergen. A history of severe allergy should lead to the consideration of
anaphylaxis. Stressful events can precipitate asthma attacks but may
also cause anxious patients to hyperventilate.

Relieving factors
Dyspnoea resulting from cardiac failure may be relieved by sitting
upright, and, when due to asthma, by beta agonists.

Associated factors
Cough productive of (green, yellow, rusty) sputum indicates the
presence of a chest infection. This may be the primary cause or it may
exacerbate dyspnoea in patients with an existing condition such as
asthma, COPD or cardiac failure. Bloodstained sputum may result from
a chest infection (especially TB), pulmonary embolism or a tumour.
Wheezing may result from asthma or aspiration of a foreign body.

Examination
Inspection

[START_SECTION]Cyanosis, which is observed from the fingertips (peripheral) or in the
mucous membranes (central), is an indicator of severe underlying
disease. Decreased consciousness level may indicate a life-threatening
situation. However, it may also be the presenting feature of patients
with a metabolic acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis). Kyphosis severe
enough to cause dyspnoea should be evident on general inspection.
Patients with COPD may appear barrel-chested and cyanosed or thin
and tachypnoeic (with pursed-lip breathing) accompanied by the
prominent use of the accessory musculature.
The respiratory rate per se may not be very specific but extremes may
be indicators of severity of the underlying disease. The respiratory rate
should be carefully counted and not just estimated.
The hands should be inspected for clubbing, as it is associated with
bronchial carcinoma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (p. 64).

Pulse
A change in rate or regularity of rhythm may indicate an arrhythmia as
a precipitating factor (usually in pre-existing heart or lung disease). The
rate itself is not, however, very specific to the underlying aetiology.

JVP
Acute elevation of the JVP suggests tension pneumothorax, pulmonary
embolism, cardiac tamponade or tricuspid regurgitation (prominent v
waves). Chronic elevation results from congestive heart failure or any
chronic lung disease with right heart failure (cor pulmonale).

Temperature
An elevated temperature may occur with a chest infection and
pulmonary embolism.

Trachea

[START_SECTION]The trachea deviates away from the side of a tension pneumothorax,
pleural effusion and any large mass. It deviates to the side of a collapsed
segment, which can result with obstruction of the bronchial lumen from
tumour or foreign bodies.

Expansion
May be reduced on the side of an area of consolidation (infection),
pneumothorax and effusion. It may be reduced bilaterally in patients
with COPD.

Percussion
The area overlying consolidation, effusion or collapse is dull to
percussion. Hyper-resonance is often described on the affected side of a
pneumothorax; however, a ‘relative dullness’ of the unaffected side is the
usual initial finding.

Auscultation of the precordium
Auscultation may reveal murmurs associated with valvular heart
disease. The presence of a third heart sound is consistent with cardiac
failure, and quiet heart sounds may be due to an overexpanded chest
from COPD.

Breath sounds
Localised reduction in the intensity of breath sounds occurs over areas
with consolidation or collapse of the lung; however, it may be reduced
generally with asthma and COPD.

Added sounds
Wheezing may be appreciated in a localised area following intraluminal
airway obstruction from an inhaled foreign body or tumour.

[START_SECTION]Generalised wheezing usually occurs with asthma. When a history of
pre-existing asthma is not evident, then consider anaphylaxis. Localised
crepitations may be auscultated over areas of pulmonary consolidation.
Extensive bilateral crepitations occur with idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (fine inspiratory), pulmonary oedema and bronchopneumonia.

General Investigations
■ FBC
Hb ↓ points to anaemia as the primary cause or as an exacerbating
factor of underlying disease. Hb ↑ (polycythaemia) may be seen in
chronic lung disease. WCC ↑ usually indicates infection, but it can also
occur with other conditions, such as pulmonary embolism.
■ Peak expiratory flow rate
This simple bedside test allows you to evaluate airflow limitation. A
reduced flow rate may indicate asthma or chronic airflow limitation.
■ ECG
Arrhythmias are readily appreciated on the ECG; atrial fibrillation or
supraventricular tachycardia may precipitate dyspnoea in patients with
pre-existing heart or lung disease. However, an arrhythmia may be a
manifestation of the underlying cause, such as myocardial infarction,
pulmonary embolism and hypoxia. ST segment elevations occur with
myocardial infarction and are also a non-specific finding in pulmonary
embolism. Right bundle-branch block may occur in the presence of
longstanding lung disease.
■ Pulse oximetry
Although low saturation per se is not very discriminatory, acute severe
impairment of oxygen saturation is associated with pulmonary embolus
and pneumothorax. Post-exercise desaturation is helpful if opportunistic
pneumonia is suspected.
■ ABGs
Useful to quantify severity of the disease and subtype of respiratory
failure. Normal levels of oxygenation, however, are not useful to exclude
respiratory or cardiac disease. Low levels of bicarbonate indicate

[START_SECTION]metabolic acidosis and should lead to the investigation of the underlying
cause, such as diabetic ketoacidosis. An alkalosis (high pH) with low
Pco2 and high Po2 points to hyperventilation. CO2 retention may result
from chronic lung disease (type II respiratory failure) or may indicate
the need for ventilation with co-existing hypoxia in asthmatics.
■ Serum cardiac markers
Cardiac troponin or CK-MB is elevated with myocardial infarction in
the setting of acute left ventricular failure.
■ CXR
Hyperinflation of the lungs (if the hemidiaphragm is below the 7th rib
anteriorly or the 12th rib posteriorly) is a feature of emphysema, and
may also result from asthma. Areas of consolidation are seen on a plain
film; however, radiographic changes of a chest infection may lag behind
in time with the clinical findings. The presence of cardiac failure is
appreciated by cardiomegaly, upper lobe diversion of the pulmonary
veins, bilateral pleural effusions, Kerley B lines (1–2 cm horizontal lines
in the periphery of the lung fields) and patchy pulmonary oedema. A
pneumothorax may be diagnosed by identifying the line of the pleura
and the absence of lung markings beyond it. Bronchial carcinoma may
present as a hilar mass, peripheral opacity or collapse and consolidation
of the lung due to airways obstruction.

Specific Investigations
■ Sputum and blood cultures
Should be taken if an infective aetiology (pneumonia, lung abscess) is
suspected, preferably before antibiotics are administered.
■ Respiratory function tests
Apart from physiological measurements of the lung, spirometry allows
classification of restrictive or obstructive lung defects. It can also
provide information regarding severity of the disease and the response
to inhaled bronchodilators. Flow volume loops can indicate fixed
airways obstruction (plateau in the expiration phase), which can result
from foreign body or intraluminal tumour. Restrictive pattern of

[START_SECTION]ventilatory impairment is characterised by a normal FEV1 to FVC ratio
and a reduced vital capacity. It is characteristic of pulmonary fibrosis,
infiltrative lung disease and restriction of chest wall motion. Obstructive
pattern of ventilatory impairment is characterised by a reduced FEV1 to
FVC ratio and a normal vital capacity. It is characteristic of asthma,
COPD, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis.
■ Bronchoscopy
Bronchoscopy should be performed if aspiration of a foreign body is
suspected, the procedure can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.
Intraluminal bronchial carcinomas may be visualised and biopsied.
Bronchoscopy also allows collection of specimens for culture in the
diagnosis of pneumonia.
■ CT thorax/pulmonary angiogram
The majority of pulmonary emboli may be diagnosed by CT pulmonary
angiography. In addition, complete visualisation of the thorax by CT is
useful to evaluate masses of unknown aetiology, and for staging of
bronchial carcinoma. High-resolution CT is useful to screen for features
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
■ Echocardiography
An echocardiogram is indicated if cardiac failure or valvular heart
disease is suspected. A large pulmonary embolus can be diagnosed by a
finding of right heart failure and elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
Elevated pulmonary artery pressures can also be caused by pulmonary
hypertension causing dyspnoea. Although a proportion are idiopathic,
known causes are congenital heart disease, any severe lung disease and
recurrent pulmonary emboli.
• Cyanosis associated with dyspnoea is an ominous sign.
Emergency admission and treatment is required.
• Pneumothorax is commoner in asthmatics. If an asthmatic
suddenly becomes short of breath, consider pneumothorax as
a possible diagnosis.
• Sudden onset of breathlessness in an elderly patient may be
due to LVF. This may be the result of a myocardial infarction.

[START_SECTION]• Always remember an inhaled foreign body as a possible
cause of acute dyspnoea.

[START_SECTION]Ear Disorders
Ear disorders are common in general practice. Earache is a frequent
complaint. It may represent intrinsic ear disease or it may be due to
referred pain from the oral cavity or pharynx. Causes of deafness are
dealt with on p. 94.

Causes
Local
External Ear
• Trauma
• Boils
• Inclusion dermoid

External Auditory Meatus
• Otitis externa
• Furuncle
• Malignant disease

Middle Ear
• Acute otitis media (Fig. 16)
• Chronic otitis media
• Mastoiditis

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 16 Acute otitis media.
There is inflammation of the tympanic membrane, which is also bulging
due to pus in the middle ear.

Referred Pain

• Foreign body
• Quinsy
• Carcinoma of the posterior third of the tongue

Neurological
• Herpes zoster
• Glossopharyngeal neuralgia

History
Local
External ear
Trauma may cause subperichondrial haematoma. This is usually caused
by a shearing blow. The patient will present with bruising and a

[START_SECTION]swelling. If the swelling is not drained, repeated trauma occurs, and this
will lead to the condition of ‘cauliflower ear’, often seen in rugby
players. Avulsion of the ear is rare but may occur in major trauma.
Occasionally, cellulitis and swelling of the ear occur due to bites, either
animal or human. The patient may complain of a swelling on the lobe of
the ear. Enquire whether there has been any recent ear-piercing, as
inclusion dermoids may result. Ulcers may arise on the pinna as a result
of malignant disease, the most common being squamous cell
carcinomas and rodent ulcers.

External auditory meatus
The patient may complain of irritation, discharge, pain and occasionally
deafness. Inflammation may spread out onto the pinna. There may be a
history of poking the ear with a matchstick or hairgrip to remove wax. It
may occur in those who swim frequently at public baths. With a
furuncle (boil) in the external auditory meatus, the patient will present
with extreme pain and throbbing. The pain is made worse by inserting
an auriscope into the meatus. There may be a history of a foreign body
inserted into the external auditory meatus. The patient is most
commonly a child. Seeds or pips may have been inserted into the ear. In
adults, it is often matchsticks, cotton-wool buds or paperclips that have
been inserted to remove wax from the ear. Occasionally an insect gets
into the ear. There is usually pain and discharge. Malignant disease of
the external auditory meatus is rare. When advanced, it may cause
intractable pain, bloodstained discharge and may invade the middle ear,
facial nerve or the temporomandibular joint. The patient may present
with a facial palsy.

Middle ear
Acute otitis media usually occurs in children. There may be a preceding
history of common cold, tonsillitis, adenoiditis or infectious disease of
childhood. In adults, there may be a history of sinusitis, trauma, airflight or temporal bone fracture. The patient presents with severe
earache, often with deafness, and appears flushed and ill. Chronic otitis

[START_SECTION]media presents with a history of deafness, discomfort in the ear, tinnitus
and occasionally problems with the balance. Acute mastoiditis is a
complication of otitis media. It is rare nowadays because of antibiotics.
Occasionally, children still present with pain, discharge (creamy and
profuse) and deafness, with swelling behind the ear.

Referred pain
Check for a history of dental problems. In the elderly, there may be
carcinoma of the posterior third of the tongue. A classical picture of this
used to be the elderly man spitting blood with a piece of cotton wool in
his ear. Check for a history of tonsillitis or pharyngitis or difficulty in
swallowing due to quinsy. Occasionally a foreign body lodged in the
pharynx may be responsible. Other malignant disease of the pharynx
may cause referred pain. Check for a history of dysphagia.

Neurological
Herpes zoster of the geniculate ganglion may give rise to lesions of the
external auditory meatus, pinna and sometimes the palate.
Glossopharyngeal neuralgia presents with very severe pain radiating
from throat to tongue and into the ear.

Examination
Local
External ear
With trauma, there may be obvious subperichondrial haematomas. Bites
will result in cellulitis and swelling of the ear. Inclusion dermoids
usually follow ear-piercing and present as lumps in the lobe of the ear
adjacent to the area of piercing. Malignant disease will usually present
as an ulcer, either with a typical appearance of a rodent ulcer or with the
everted edges of a squamous cell carcinoma.

[START_SECTION]External auditory meatus
There is often inflammation at the entry to the meatus. The meatus is
tender and there is moist debris, oedema and redness of the meatal wall
on examination with an auriscope. A furuncle (boil) is extremely painful.
Examination with the auriscope will reveal the tense, tender boil or even
pus in the external auditory meatus. A foreign body is usually obvious
on examination with the auriscope, as is malignant disease.

Middle ear
With acute otitis media, the patient is usually flushed and ill, often with
a temperature of 39–40°C. Examination of the tympanic membrane
shows loss of lustre and disruption of the light reflex. There is redness,
fullness and bulging of the drum. There may be signs of perforation with
otorrhoea, with a mucoid, purulent or bloodstained discharge. Chronic
otitis media shows fluid in the middle ear (glue ear), with discoloration
and often retraction of the tympanic membrane. Tuning-fork test will
reveal conductive deafness. In acute mastoiditis the child is usually ill
with a high pyrexia. There is tenderness over the mastoid process and
post-auricular swelling. The tympanic membrane may be red and
bulging or perforated with discharge.

Referred pain
Examine for dental problems. Examine the posterior third of the tongue
for carcinoma. Inspect the throat with a mirror, looking for tonsillitis,
pharyngitis, quinsy, foreign body or malignancy.

Neurological
With herpes zoster, there will be vesicles in the meatus, on the pinna and
sometimes on the palate and fauces. This will have been preceded by
severe otalgia. With glossopharyngeal neuralgia, there may be a trigger
area in the throat in the same way as there is a trigger area that may
initiate trigeminal neuralgia.

[START_SECTION]General Investigations
The majority of ear disorders can be diagnosed on clinical examination
alone.
■ Hb, FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ malignant disease. WCC ↑ acute otitis media. Acute mastoiditis.
ESR ↑ malignancy and infection.
■ Swab
C&S. Otitis externa. Otitis media with discharge. Furuncle. Tonsillitis.
■ Biopsy
Malignant disease of the pinna and external auditory meatus. Carcinoma

■ CT
Malignancy. Mastoiditis.
• Referred pain to the ear is not uncommon. In the elderly, it
may represent referred pain from a carcinoma of the posterior
third of the tongue or the nasopharynx.
• Beware the patient with middle ear infection who develops
headache, confusion or neurological signs. Middle ear
infection may progress to cause meningitis or cerebral
abscess in rare cases.

[START_SECTION]Eye Disorders
Most eye disorders tend to present as ‘red eye’. It is the single most
common ophthalmic complaint encountered by general practitioners.

History
Pain
Most disorders of the eye present with pain. Sudden onset of unilateral
eye pain and lacrimation may be due to a foreign body. Patients with

[START_SECTION]infective conjunctivitis tend to complain of a soreness rather than true
pain. Patients with blepharitis complain of a foreign body sensation or
grittiness, whereas patients with allergic conjunctivitis (hayfever, acute
allergy or atopy) tend to complain of itching rather than pain. Severe
pain is experienced with corneal abrasions, ulcers, angle-closure
glaucoma, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, uveitis and scleritis. Patients
with either of the last two conditions experience exacerbation of pain on
palpating the globe. A stye is a suppurative inflammation of an eyelash
follicle. It is common and extremely painful. A meibomian cyst is an
infection of a meibomian gland, which is in the posterior half of the
eyelid margin. Following inflammation of a meibomian gland, it may
either resolve spontaneously or leave a pea-size swelling known as a
chalazion. Entropion is the rolling inwards of the lid margin. The
eyelashes irritate the conjunctiva and cornea, causing a painful red eye.
The opposite condition is known as ectropion and usually results in a
watery eye. Subconjunctival haemorrhages are usually spontaneous and,
although they may present with impressive chemosis (soft-tissue
swelling), they are not usually painful.

Visual disturbance
Impairment of vision can occur with corneal ulceration, uveitis and
acute angle-closure glaucoma. This is usually associated with
photophobia. In addition, patients with glaucoma may perceive halos
around lights due to corneal oedema.

Discharge
Documenting the presence, amount and colour of any discharge
originating from the eye is important. A purulent discharge is associated
with bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis, and a clear discharge with
allergic and viral conjunctivitis.

Past medical history

[START_SECTION]A history of atopy or hayfever may be present in patients with allergic
conjunctivitis. Previous herpes infection on the face may be the only clue
with dendritic corneal ulceration. Conjunctivitis, urethritis and arthritis
form the triad of Reiter’s syndrome caused by Chlamydia trachomatis
infection. A history of contact lens use is important, as patients may
develop sight-threatening infections acutely.
Scleritis is a deeper and more severe inflammatory process than
episcleritis. It tends to be associated with connective tissue diseases,
such as rheumatoid disease and SLE.
Uveitis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis,
ankylosing spondylitis and sarcoidosis. Orbital congestion may be seen
in patients with thyroid disorders. Xanthelasma are fatty plaques in the
skin of the eyelids. Extensive or multiple xanthelasma may indicate
abnormalities of cholesterol metabolism, diabetes or arterial disease.

Examination
Visual acuity should be assessed with correcting spectacles or pinhole,
and documented with reference to a Snellen chart. Conditions that
present with visual impairment are corneal ulceration, uveitis and
glaucoma. Patients with these conditions should be referred to an
ophthalmologist. The eyelids should be carefully inspected. Swelling of
the upper eyelid with redness may indicate a stye. There may be a bead
of pus apparent at the infected hair follicle. The upper eyelid is everted
to inspect for a meibomian cyst and foreign bodies. Papillae
(conjunctival elevations with a vessel in the centre) are seen with
allergic conjunctivitis, and follicles (collections of lymphocytes) may be
visible with viral or chlamydial infection. Ectropion and entropion are
usually obvious: in the former the lower eyelid is everted and in the
latter it is inverted, the eyelashes scratch the conjunctiva and cornea
giving rise to a red, watery eye. A similar effect is produced by
trichiasis, which is caused by irregular pointing lashes. Xanthelasma are
fatty plaques in the skin of the eyelids. They look like masses of yellow
opaque fat. They are not painful or tender.

[START_SECTION]Inspection is then undertaken to identify the presence of any foreign
bodies on the surface of the eye. Areas of erythema should be carefully
assessed. Diffuse erythema, maximal in the fornices, is a feature of
conjunctivitis. Localised areas of segmental erythema may be due to
episcleritis, but if it is maximal near the limbus it may be a focal
keratitis. Scleritis produces a brawny red discoloration, while a deep
crimson-red area is observed with subconjunctival haemorrhage.
Marked erythema adjacent to the iris is known as a ciliary flush and
occurs with anterior uveitis and glaucoma.
Attention is then focussed on to the cornea. Ulceration of the cornea
may not be visible without fluorescein staining. Infection may extend to
the anterior chamber, and a collection of pus (hypopyon) can present as
a white fluid level. Loss of brightness of the cornea occurs with
glaucoma due to corneal oedema.
The pupil is examined and the resting position noted. A constricted
pupil may result from ciliary spasm with uveitis and it rests in a fixed,
semi-dilated position with glaucoma.
Fluorescein staining should be performed and the eye is then viewed
with a blue filtered light: corneal abrasions or ulcerations glow green.

General Investigations
■ Swab
Microscopy and C&S for infective organisms, e.g. stye, bacterial, viral
and chlamydial conjunctivitis.
■ Rose bengal staining
To assess dead or damaged cells. It is useful in outlining a dendritic
ulcer with herpes simplex infection.
■ Blood glucose
Infections are often associated with diabetes, as are xanthelasma.

Specific Investigations
■ Intraocular pressure measurements

[START_SECTION]↑ glaucoma, uveitis.
■ Corneal scrape
For infective lesions.
• Conjunctivitis is usually bilateral. If unilateral red eye,
consider other conditions.
• Fluorescein staining should be performed routinely in the
assessment of painful disorders of the eye, as corneal
ulceration may not be visible without fluorescein staining.
• Never use steroid drops if herpetic corneal ulceration is
suspected.
• If there is a history of a foreign body, always check for highspeed injuries, e.g. metal fragments. Urgent specialist referral
is required to exclude an intraocular foreign body.

[START_SECTION]Facial Pain
Most patients are able to distinguish between pain arising from the
cranium, which is termed headache, and that of the face, which is
covered here under the heading of facial pain.

Causes
Local
Sinus
• Sinusitis
• Carcinoma

Ear
• Otitis media
• Otitis externa

Mastoid
• Mastoiditis

Teeth
• Dental abscess

Skin
• Herpes zoster (Fig. 18)
• Post-herpetic neuralgia
• Cellulitis

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 18 Facial herpes zoster.
The vesicular skin eruptions are in the distribution of the ophthalmic
division of the 5th cranial nerve.

Joints
• Temporomandibular dysfunction

Parotid Gland
• Mumps
• Parotitis
• Tumour

General
• Migraine
• Cluster headache
• Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux)
• Temporal arteritis
• Tumour
• Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
• (common in Chinese populations)
• Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania

History
In the majority, facial pain originates from local structures. Therefore
when formulating a differential diagnosis, consider the conditions

[START_SECTION]affecting the anatomical structures of the face.

Site
The site of pain is perhaps the most useful feature when discriminating
between the causes. Although local tenderness may direct the clinician
to the affected site, do not forget to consider referred pain from adjacent
structures. Pain in the region of the ear may be referred from the skin,
teeth, tonsils, pharynx, larynx or neck. Tenderness over the maxilla may
be due to sinusitis, dental abscess or carcinoma.

Character
Patients with trigeminal neuralgia often describe paroxysms of sharp,
severe pains in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve or major
divisions. Pain associated with infections of structures such as the teeth,
mastoid and ear often has a dull, aching quality.

Precipitating factors
Pain precipitated by food or chewing action may be due to a dental
abscess, salivary gland disorder, salivary duct disorder,
temporomandibular joint disorder or jaw claudication due to temporal
arteritis. Pain arising from most structures is aggravated by touch;
however, with trigeminal neuralgia, even the slightest stroking of the
skin is sufficient to produce intense pain (allodynia).

Associated symptoms
Tears may result when the lacrimal duct is obstructed by
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Complaints of otorrhoea and hearing loss
should direct the clinician to infections affecting the ear or mastoid.
Nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea occur with maxillary sinusitis and
carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. These may be accompanied by
unilateral epistaxis. Swelling of the cheek may be experienced with

[START_SECTION]dental abscesses and maxillary carcinoma. Proximal muscle pain,
stiffness and subjective weakness may accompany temporal arteritis due
to associated polymyalgia rheumatica. Paraesthesia in the distribution
of the trigeminal nerve often precedes the rash of herpes zoster.

Examination
Inspection
A thorough inspection of the face, salivary glands, ear, nose and throat
may produce a wealth of information. This involves the use of specific
equipment, such as the otoscope and nasal speculum. Unilateral
erythema and vesicles in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve may be
striking with herpes zoster infection but may not be present in the early
stages of the disease. Localised areas of erythema or swelling may also
correspond to the site of infection, such as the sinus, ear, mastoid and
parotid gland. Post-auricular swelling and downward displacement of
the pinna may be observed with mastoiditis. Maxillary swelling and
erythema can be caused by dental abscess or maxillary carcinoma. With
otitis media, injection or perforation of the tympanic membrane may be
visualised with an otoscope. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma may be seen on
direct inspection of the nose and throat. Facial paralysis may be seen
with infiltration of the facial nerve by tumours of the parotid gland.

Palpation
Gentle stroking of the skin of the face will precipitate severe pain with
trigeminal neuralgia. Tenderness may be elicited over the frontal bone
with frontal sinusitis, and over the maxilla with maxillary sinusitis.
With dental abscesses, pain is elicited over the maxilla or mandible.
Mastoid tenderness occurs with mastoiditis or otitis media, and parotid
tenderness can result from either mumps or parotitis. Tenderness along
the course of the superficial temporal artery is suggestive of temporal
arteritis. Movement of the pinna produces pain with otitis externa.
Palpation of the superficial lymph nodes of the neck may reveal

[START_SECTION]lymphadenopathy in the distribution of the lymph drainage of structures
affected by infection or carcinoma.

General Investigations
■ FBC
Hb ↓ malignancy. WCC ↑ infection.
■ ESR and CRP
Malignancy and temporal arteritis.
■ X-rays
X-rays of the sinuses show mucosal thickening with air-fluid levels in
sinusitis. Occasionally total opacification is seen with sinusitis and
mastoiditis on mastoid films. In carcinoma of the sinuses, there may be
complete opacification of the sinus and destruction of the adjacent bone.
CT will reveal the extent of invasion.

Specific Investigations
■ CT
Carcinoma of the sinuses, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, parotid
conditions. Extent of tumour and degree of invasion will be apparent.
■ MRI
Tumours – extent and invasion.
■ Sialography
Parotid conditions, e.g. duct stones, sialectasis.
■ FNAC
Parotid tumours.
■ Temporal artery biopsy
Temporal (giant cell) arteritis.
• Temporal arteritis as a possible cause of facial pain requires
emergency investigation and treatment. Other features
include jaw claudication, scalp tenderness and visual
disturbance associated with a raised ESR and/or CRP. Once

[START_SECTION]blindness occurs, it is irreversible.
• Unremitting facial pain should be investigated thoroughly
to exclude malignancy.

[START_SECTION]Facial Swellings
Facial swelling is a common presenting complaint. It may be
generalised or localised. Many cases are due to trauma or infection but
it may be a sign of systemic disease.

Causes
Traumatic
• Facial fractures
• Insect bites

Infective
• Dental infection
• Sinusitis
• Parotitis
• Erysipelas

Neoplastic
• Sinuses
• Parotid (Fig. 19)
• Jaw
• Mediastinal tumours

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 19 Pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland.
A swelling is seen in the typical position below the earlobe between the
posterior border of the ramus of the mandible and the upper end of
sternomastoid.

Vascular
• Superior vena caval thrombosis
• Cavernous sinus thrombosis

Endocrine
• Cushing’s syndrome
• Congenital hypothyroidism
• Gross clinical hypothyroidism (myxoedema)
• Acromegaly

Metabolic
• Endocrine
• Renal failure

Drug-Induced
• Steroids

Other
• Allergic reactions
• Angioneurotic oedema
• Paget’s disease

[START_SECTION]History
Traumatic
Usually obvious history of trauma. Swelling may be severe, with
bruising and closure of the palpebral fissures. Insect bites may cause
swelling due to allergy or infection. The patient may not be aware of an
insect bite.

Infective
Erysipelas is an uncommon skin infection caused by streptococci. Pain
and redness are apparent usually over the cheek. Pyrexia and malaise
may occur. Dental infections are common (see Jaw pain and swellings,
p. 262) and are often initially localised, but the side of the face may
swell. There is severe associated throbbing pain. Sinusitis presents with
constant unilateral pain over the frontal or maxillary sinuses. There is
usually puffiness of the skin overlying the sinus. Parotitis presents with
pain and swelling over the gland. If this is due to obstruction in the duct,
the swelling occurs during eating, when the patient salivates, and
regresses afterwards. Bilateral parotitis occurs with mumps.

Neoplastic
Neoplasia may affect the parotids, sinuses and jaw. There is usually
localised swelling with carcinoma of the sinuses. The patient complains
of a blocked nose and a bloodstained discharge, which may be foulsmelling. With neoplastic lesions of the jaws, there is usually deepseated boring pain in relation to the swelling. Mediastinal tumours
compress the superior vena cava and may cause suffusion of the face and
facial oedema.

Vascular
Superior vena caval thrombosis may occur. This is rare and there may

[START_SECTION]have been long-term central venous cannulation. There is cyanotic
suffusion of the face with facial oedema. Cavernous sinus thrombosis
usually presents following a history of infection of the face or in the
sinuses. There may be a history of immunosuppression or diabetes. The
patient complains of pain in the eye and forehead, with swelling around
the eye and a protruding eye. The swelling may eventually involve the
whole of the side of the face. Double vision occurs as a result of cranial
nerve involvement.

Endocrine
Cushing’s syndrome presents with swelling of the face (moon face) with
a typical red appearance. Facial swelling is also seen in acromegaly.
The patient will usually complain of an increase in shoe size and large
hands. There may also be a hoarse voice, protrusion of the jaw and
cardiac failure. Congenital hypothyroidism (formerly known as
cretinism) is associated with a puffy swollen face and enlargement and
protrusion of the tongue. Gross acquired clinical hypothyroidism
produces characteristic non-pitting oedematous changes in the skin of
the face, giving rise to a characteristic clinical appearance.

Metabolic
Puffiness around the eyelids usually indicates renal failure.

Drugs
History of steroid therapy.

Other
Allergic reactions to drugs, especially antibiotics or blood transfusions
may result in periorbital or facial oedema. Take a careful drug history.
Angioneurotic oedema chiefly affects the eyelids and lips. Recurrent
attacks of sudden onset of burning and irritation. A family history

[START_SECTION]suggest the diagnosis. Paget’s disease often presents with painful
enlargement of the skull, femur and clavicles and bowing of the tibia.
The patient notices an increase in hat size. The forehead appears
enlarged and prominent.

Examination
Traumatic
Fractures are usually obvious. Check pupillary reaction and test the
cranial nerves. Insect-bite puncture wounds may be obvious but often
they are not. There is often surrounding cellulitis and oedema.

Infective
Erysipelas presents as a red, tender area with well-demarcated margins
raised above the surrounding normal skin. The patient is usually
pyrexial. Dental abscesses are usually obvious, with local tenderness
and oedema. Sinusitis is largely diagnosed from the history, with
localised tenderness and swelling. With parotitis the gland is swollen
and tender if infection has occurred, with occasionally redness over the
skin. It may be unilateral or bilateral. Examine the orifice of the parotid
duct for stone or stenosis.

Neoplastic
Neoplasia of the parotid usually presents as an enlarged, irregular, firm
or hard swelling. There may have been a pre-existing pleomorphic
adenoma. Test the integrity of the facial nerve, which may be affected by
carcinoma. Carcinoma of the maxillary sinus may present with swelling
over the sinus. Jaw swellings are considered on p. 262. Superior vena
caval obstruction presents with facial oedema and cyanotic suffusion of
the face. Examine the chest.

Vascular

[START_SECTION]Superior vena caval thrombosis presents in a similar way to obstruction.
With cavernous sinus thrombosis, there will be oedema, redness and
swelling around the orbit, spreading onto the face. Exophthalmos will be
present. Test for paresis of cranial nerves III, IV and VI. The patient will
usually be pyrexial and ill.

Endocrine
In Cushing’s syndrome, there will be moon face, and usually other
features such as striae, buffalo hump, proximal myopathy. In congenital
hypothyroidism, there is a broad, flat face, the eyes are wide apart and
the tongue protrudes from the mouth. In acromegaly, there is a large
face with overgrowth of the soft tissues of the face, nose, lips and tongue.
The patient will have large hands and a large protuberant jaw
(prognathism).

Metabolic
In renal failure, the swelling usually occurs around the eyes. There may
also be peripheral oedema and hypertension. There is usually a bronzelemon tinge to the skin in chronic renal failure.

Drugs
Steroid therapy gives an appearance similar to Cushing’s syndrome (see
above).

Other
In allergic reactions, there is often swelling of the eyes, lips and face,
with urticaria of other areas on the body. Laryngeal oedema and
bronchospasm may occur. Angioneurotic oedema is usually diagnosed
from the history. Examination will reveal swellings of the eyelids and
lips, with burning and irritation. In Paget’s disease, there is an
enlargement of the skull, with the vault of the skull bulging outwards

[START_SECTION]above the eyes. Deafness may occur. Occasionally, there is compression
of the cranial nerves. Test the cranial nerves. High output cardiac failure
may be present.

Acromegaly.
• Localised swelling with complaint of a blocked nose or a
bloodstained nasal discharge is strongly suggestive of
carcinoma of the sinuses.
• Parotid swelling with facial palsy suggests a malignant
parotid tumour with involvement of the facial nerve.
• Sudden generalised swelling of the face suggests an allergic
reaction.

[START_SECTION]Facial Ulcers
Most facial ulcers are serious. Malignant facial ulcers are common in
patients who work outdoors and are exposed to ultraviolet light. Lesions
of the lips have been dealt with elsewhere (p. 316) and will not be
included here.

Causes
Traumatic
• Physical
• Chemical
• Irradiation
• Dermatitis artefacta
• Neuropathy – anaesthetic areas after surgery for trigeminal
neuralgia
• Bites

Neoplastic
• Basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer) (Fig. 20) • (rare in
tropical Africa)
• Squamous cell carcinoma
• Malignant melanoma

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 20 The larger nodular lesion on the cheek is a typical basal cell
carcinoma.
Note the pearly appearance of the lesion which is beginning to ulcerate.
The smaller lesion lateral to the basal cell carcinoma is a benign naevus.

Infective
• Herpes simplex
• Herpes zoster
• Keratoacanthoma
• Syphilis
• Chancre
• Gumma
• Leishmaniasis • (common in tropical and subtropical areas)

Other
• Pyoderma gangrenosum

History
A history of trauma should be sought. This may be as minor as
scratching a spot. Self-inflicted injury resulting in dermatitis artefacta
may be suspected when other causes have been excluded. Has the
patient had radiotherapy in the past to suggest irradiation causes?
Anaesthetised skin is easily traumatised. In the case of the face,

[START_SECTION]anaesthesia may have arisen following surgery to the trigeminal
ganglion for trigeminal neuralgia. Syringobulbia is a rare cause of facial
anaesthesia. Check for a history of bites, insect, animal or human, which
may become infected and ulcerate.
Malignant ulcers are usually on exposed areas of the face. Check the
patient’s occupation. Malignancy is more common in outdoor workers
exposed to ultraviolet light. Most rodent ulcers occur above a line drawn
from the angle of the mouth to the lobe of the ear. Their incidence
increases with age. Malignant ulcers are usually painless, unless they
become infected. They may be pigmented and there may be a history of
a change in a pre-existing mole to suggest malignant melanoma. These
changes include: change in size; change in colour, with deepening
pigmentation; bleeding or ulceration; itching; inflammatory ‘halo’;
satellite nodules; palpable regional lymph nodes.
Infection may be due to herpes simplex, which may spread from
around the lips or nose. The patient will complain of an itchy, burning
red area, on which vesicles form and then crust over and ulcerate.
Herpes zoster may arise in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Pain
precedes malaise and fever by a few days. Vesicles develop later and
may ulcerate. Syphilis is rare and may give rise to either a chancre or
gumma (see Lip lesions, p. 316). Leishmaniasis is spread by sandflies
and there would be a history of travel to India, Africa, the Middle East or
the Mediterranean. There would be a history of bite leaving an itchy
papule, leading to an ulcer. Keratoacanthoma may be due to a virus. It
resembles a squamous cell carcinoma, from which it needs to be
carefully distinguished. It occurs in adults as a rapidly growing lump
with a central core filled with keratin. It usually takes 2–3 weeks to
grow and often resolves spontaneously over several months. A history
of inflammatory bowel disease will suggest pyoderma gangrenosum.

Examination
Benign ulcers
These usually have a sloping edge. Check the face for normal sensation

[START_SECTION]to pain and temperature.

Malignant ulcers
Basal cell carcinomas (rodent ulcers) usually have a raised, rolled,
pearly margin. They may become very large and erode deeply and
locally. They do not metastasise and therefore local lymph nodes should
not be enlarged unless the lesion becomes infected. Squamous cell
carcinoma presents as an ulcerated lesion with an everted edge.
Metastasis occurs to local lymph nodes and these may be palpable. Care
should be taken to distinguish a squamous cell carcinoma from a
keratoacanthoma, which is a benign, fast-growing, self-limiting papule
surmounted by a keratin plug (it resembles a small volcano with a
crater). Malignant melanomas vary in colour from pinkish-brown to
black. They may develop a purplish hue due to a rich blood supply.
There may be a brownish-pink ‘halo’ around the lesion or there may be
‘satellite’ nodules. The local lymph nodes may be enlarged. Early
metastases may occur to the liver and therefore patients should be
examined for hepatomegaly.

Infective
The characteristic lesions of herpes simplex will be seen around the lips
and nose. In immunosuppressed patients, these lesions may coalesce and
become infected. Ophthalmic herpes zoster will be recognised by its
characteristic distribution in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal
nerve. It may affect the cornea. A syphilitic chancre begins as a macule,
becoming a painless, hard ulcer, which is very infectious. It develops
rapidly and is associated with enlargement of the local lymph nodes. A
gumma occurring on the face is uncommon. It appears as a punched-out
ulcer with a wash-leather base. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (oriental sore)
develops at the site of a sandfly bite, commencing as an itchy papule,
from which the crusts may separate, leaving an ulcer with deep
perpendicular edges. Pyoderma gangrenosum presents with a nodule or
pustule, which ulcerates with tender, reddish, blue necrotic edges.

[START_SECTION]General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
WCC ↑ infected ulcer. ESR ↑ malignancy, syphilis.
■ LFTs
Alkaline phosphatase may be raised with liver secondaries, e.g.
malignant melanoma.
■ Swab
C&S from infected ulcer. Dark-ground illumination microscopy for
Treponema pallidum.
■ Biopsy
Benign versus malignant. Keratoacanthoma versus squamous cell
carcinoma. In the case of malignant melanoma, excision biopsy is
required.

Specific Investigations
■ VDRL
Syphilis.
■ Aspiration of lesion
Leishmaniasis – protozoal organism may be seen by microscopy in
aspirates from fluid at the edge of the ulcer.
■ Viral culture
Herpes simplex, herpes zoster (rarely needed – diagnosis usually
obvious clinically).
■ Antibody titres
Herpes simplex, herpes zoster (rarely needed – diagnosis usually
obvious clinically).
• Facial ulcers in the elderly and those with outside
occupations are likely to be malignant. Rodent ulcers are the
most common.
• Ophthalmic herpes zoster will be recognised by its
characteristic distribution in the ophthalmic division of the

[START_SECTION]trigeminal nerve. Corneal ulceration may occur. Urgent
treatment is required.

[START_SECTION]Faecal Incontinence
Faecal incontinence implies loss of voluntary control of passage of
faeces from the anus. Faecal soiling of the clothes occurs, which is
socially embarrassing for the patient. Any disease process that interferes
with rectal sensation or affects function of the anorectal musculature
may produce incontinence. However, incontinence may still occur with
normal sphincters and pelvic floor, for example in severe diarrhoea.

Causes
Normal Sphincters and Pelvic Floor
• Severe diarrhoea, e.g. infection, inflammatory bowel disease
• Faecal impaction

Abnormal Sphincters and/or Pelvic Floor
Congenital
• Anorectal anomalies, meningomyelocele

Acquired
Traumatic
• Iatrogenic
• Internal sphincter surgery, e.g. anal dilatation or
sphincterotomy
• Fistula-in-ano surgery
• Obstetric – traumatic childbirth
• Pelvic fractures
• Impalement

[START_SECTION]Neurological
• Multiple sclerosis
• Spinal injuries
• Spinal tumours
• Peripheral neuropathy
• Stroke
• Dementia
Other
• Rectal prolapse
• Extensive anorectal carcinoma
• Fistula-in-ano
• Radiotherapy
• Lymphogranuloma venereum

History
Is there a history of trauma, e.g. pelvic fractures, impalement injuries?
Probably the commonest cause of faecal incontinence is gastroenteritis.
The history will be obvious. A history of inflammatory bowel disease
may be elicited. Other important factors to elicit in the history are recent
anorectal surgery; recent difficult childbirth – long duration of labour,
forceps delivery, forceful delivery, perineal tears, episiotomy;
predisposition to peripheral neuropathy, e.g. diabetes mellitus, vitamin
B12 deficiency, alcoholism or medication. A history of constipation may
suggest faecal impaction. A history of a recent stroke, dementia or
neurological illness will usually be obvious.

Examination
Soiling of the underwear may be apparent at examination. Digital rectal
examination will demonstrate any reduction in anal tone and the
inability to sustain a voluntary contraction. It may be possible to feel the

[START_SECTION]defect in the anorectal ring. Faecal impaction may well also be obvious
on digital rectal examination. Is there any evidence of trauma or
infection? Rectal prolapse may be apparent or descend during straining.
Look for evidence of a fistula-in-ano or extensive anorectal cancer. Full
neurological examination will often be necessary.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Macrocytic anaemia may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency
(peripheral neuropathy).
■ LFTs
Deranged in alcoholism, which may be a cause of peripheral
neuropathy.
■ Blood glucose
Neuropathy of diabetes mellitus.
■ Sigmoidoscopy
Biopsy.
■ Proctoscopy
Biopsy.

Specific Investigations
■ Endoanal US
May show defect in anorectal musculature.
■ Anorectal manometry
May demonstrate cause of incontinence.
■ EMG
■ MRI
Defects in anorectal musculature. Pelvic malignancy. Spinal tumours.
• Faecal incontinence is common in frail, elderly people.
• Faecal incontinence is a feature of many neurological
diseases. Up to 50% of patients with multiple sclerosis may

[START_SECTION]experience faecal incontinence.
• Faecal incontinence is a symptom or sign rather than a
disease. Onset of faecal incontinence in an otherwise well
patient may be an indication of developing neurological
disease.

[START_SECTION]Finger Lesions
Lesions of the fingers are common. The fingers are important tactile
organs and hand function may be impaired. Painful finger lesions are
dealt with on p. 153.

Causes
Congenital
• Absent digit
• Extra digit
• Syndactyly (fusion of digits)
• Camptodactyly

Acquired
Traumatic/Degenerative
• Dupuytren’s contracture
• Implantation dermoid
• Pyogenic granuloma
• Trigger finger
• Mallet finger
• Swan-neck deformity
• Boutonnière deformity (Fig. 21)
• Heberden’s nodes
• Mucous cyst
• Calluses over knuckles (bulimia)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 21 Boutonnière deformity.
This common deformity in advanced rheumatoid arthritis results from the
rupture of the central slip of the extensor tendon over the proximal
interphalangeal joint. The lateral slips of the extensor tendon mechanism
are displaced to the sides and maintain the deformity.

Metabolic
• Tophaceous gout
• Ectopic calcification (chronic renal failure)

Connective Tissue Disease
• Calcinosis in CREST syndrome

Neoplastic
• Subungual melanoma
• Enchondroma

History
Congenital
These lesions will be recognisable at birth. They may be associated with
other congenital abnormalities.

Acquired

[START_SECTION]Traumatic/degenerative
Dupuytren’s contracture
In the early phases, the patient may merely complain of a nodule in the
palm near the base of the ring finger. Eventually, the patient complains
of being unable to extend fully the MCP joint at the ring, and later, the
little finger. It affects the patient’s grip. The patient complains of
difficulty dressing – either poke themselves in the eye while brushing
hair or catch the finger on a trouser pocket. There may be a family
history. Check also for a history of epilepsy, cirrhosis or diabetes.
Implantation dermoid
Cysts occur where skin is forcibly implanted into the subcutaneous
tissue as a result of injury. There is likely to be a history of injury, often
minor, e.g. pinprick. Implantation dermoid used to be common in
women who sewed – hence the use of protective thimbles. The patient
complains of small painful swellings on the finger tips.
Pyogenic granuloma
Pyogenic granuloma is a common inflammatory lesion of the skin
which arises in response to minor penetrating foreign bodies such as
splinters or thorns. Pyogenic granulomas are solitary, reddish-blue
fleshy nodules. The surface may be ulcerated in which case the lesion
may be clinically indistinguishable from amelanotic malignant
melanoma.
Trigger finger
The patient complains that the finger ‘jumps’ or ‘clicks’ as it moves. It
may get stuck in the flexed position. There is not usually a history of
injury.
Mallet finger
This results from injury to the extensor tendon of the terminal phalanx.
There is usually a history of injury. It occurs if the tip of the finger is

[START_SECTION]forcibly flexed during active extension (stubbed), e.g. catching a cricket
ball. The finger adopts a position in which the distal phalanx is flexed.
Swan-neck deformity
The patient complains of deformity of the distal finger.
Boutonnière deformity
This is the opposite of swan-neck deformity. Again, the patient merely
complains of a deformity of the distal finger.
Heberden’s nodes
The patient complains of swelling close to the distal finger joints, i.e.
swelling and deformity of the knuckles. There may be a history of
osteoarthritis elsewhere.
Mucous cyst
The patient complains of a swelling over the dorsum of the DIP joint. It
may discharge.
Calluses over knuckles (bulimia)
Calluses over the knuckles (Russell’s sign) may arise in bulimics due to
repeated self-induced vomiting over a long period of time. The condition
arises from the patient’s knuckles making contact with the incisor teeth
during the act of inducing the gag reflex at the back of the throat with the
fingers.

Metabolic
Tophaceous gout
There may be a history of gout. Deposits of uric acid occur in joints or
soft tissues and the patient complains of swellings on the fingers.
Ectopic calcification
The patient complains of hard, whitish, subcutaneous swellings. There

[START_SECTION]may be a history of hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcaemia or chronic
renal failure.

Connective tissue disease
CREST syndrome
The patient complains of white deposits in the pulps of the fingers.

Neoplastic
Subungual melanoma
This occurs as a pigmented lesion beneath the nail. There is no history of
trauma as with a subungual haematoma, which may also appear
pigmented when the bruise organises. Unlike subungual haematoma, a
melanoma does not grow out with the nail. Eventually the melanoma
may lift the nail and ulcerate.
Enchondroma
The patient notices a bony, hard swelling along the finger. It may occur
beneath the nail and result in deformity of the nail (subungual exostosis).

Examination
Congenital
Congenital anomalies of the fingers will be obvious at birth. With
camptodactyly, there is painless flexion deformity at the PIP joint of the
little finger. Check for other associated congenital anomalies.

Acquired
Traumatic/degenerative
Dupuytren’s contracture
Examination may reveal only a firm painless nodule in the palmar fascia

[START_SECTION]near the base of the ring finger. Puckering of skin of the palm may be
obvious. Eventually, the MCP joint and PIP joint become flexed. The DIP
joint remains extended. Garrod’s knuckle pads on dorsum of PIP joints.
Check for signs of diabetes or liver disease. Occasionally the condition
is associated with Peyronie’s disease of the penis.
Implantation dermoid
Examination reveals small firm spherical swellings in the subcutaneous
tissues of the finger tips.
Trigger finger
The patient may be able to demonstrate how the finger sticks and then
snaps out in extension. Thickening of the tendon and the tendon sheath
may be felt over the head of the metacarpal bone.
Mallet finger
The distal phalanx of the affected finger remains flexed at about 20°
when the patient tries to straighten the finger.
Swan-neck deformity
There is hyperextension of the PIP joint and flexion of the distal
interphalangeal joint.
Boutonnière deformity
This is the opposite of swan-neck deformity. Flexion of the PIP joint
occurs, with hyperextension of the DIP joint. It develops when the PIP
joint pokes through a rupture of the centre of the extensor expansion.
Heberden’s nodes
These are bony swellings on the dorsal surface of the fingers just distal
to the DIP.
Mucous cyst
Swelling on the dorsum of the DIP joint. Discharge may be apparent.

[START_SECTION]May be a groove in the nail due to pressure on the nailbed.

Metabolic
Tophaceous gout
Swellings, often multi-lobulated, occur on the fingers. They contain
toothpaste-like infiltrates of uric acid crystals.
Ectopic calcification
Firm to hard, yellow-white deposits of calcium occur in the
subcutaneous tissues.

Connective tissue disease
CREST syndrome
Small, hard, subcutaneous nodules in the finger pulps and on the dorsal
aspects of the fingers.

Neoplastic
Subungual melanoma
A subungual melanoma is seen as a brown lesion with an indistinct
edge. Occasionally it may be quite extensive and have lifted the nail.
Enchondroma
This is a painless, hard swelling on the bone. The surface of it is usually
smooth. It may occur under the nail and lift the nail.

General Investigations
The diagnosis of most of these lesions is made on clinical examination
alone.

melanoma. Excision biopsy for malignant melanoma.
• Subungual melanoma needs to be carefully distinguished
from subungual haematoma. Check for a history of trauma. A
subungual haematoma grows out with the nail. A subungual
melanoma does not.

[START_SECTION]Finger Pain
A painful finger is a common presenting symptom. This may vary from
an obvious local lesion to part of a generalised disease, e.g. rheumatoid
arthritis. Impairment of the function of even a single finger may grossly
impair the overall function of the hand.

Causes
Traumatic
• Subungual haematoma
• Fractures

Inflammatory/Infective
• Paronychia
• Pulp space infection
• Tendon sheath infection

Neoplastic
• Glomus tumour
• Bone tumour
• Secondary deposits in bone

Degenerative
• Rheumatoid arthritis

Vascular
• Chilblains
• Small vessel disease

[START_SECTION]• Raynaud’s phenomenon (Fig. 22)
• Buerger’s disease
• Diabetes

FIGURE 22 Raynaud’s phenomenon.
There is severe blanching of the tip of the left middle finger. The phase of
pallor is followed by a phase of cyanosis followed by a sudden
vasodilatation with a painful tingling red digit.

Metabolic
• Gout

Autoimmune
• Scleroderma

Neurological
• Carpal tunnel syndrome
• Cervical lesions

History
Traumatic

[START_SECTION]There will be a history of trauma, often a crushing injury. Subungual
haematoma results from ‘trapping’ of the nail. It is extremely painful, as
a bruise comes up between the nail and the nailbed.

Inflammatory/infective
Paronychia
This presents as a painful, tender spot close to the nail. It throbs and may
keep the patient awake. There may be a history of picking the skin
around the nail. Pus may exude from the side of the nail.

Pulp space infection
This occurs in the pulp space of the fingertip. There may be a history of
penetrating injury, e.g. a prick with a sharp object. There is pain, redness
and swelling, and the finger throbs.

Tendon sheath infection
There may be a history of a direct puncture wound or there may be a
preceding pulp space infection, which has extended into a tendon sheath.
The patient presents with a red, tender and painful finger held in slight
flexion at the IP and MCP joint.

Neoplastic
Glomus tumour
This is a rare lesion but it is very painful. The patient complains of
severe pain every time the nail is touched, the most common site being
below the nail.

Primary and secondary bone tumours
These are rare in the phalanges. Pain and swelling occurs and there may
be a history of a primary tumour, e.g. breast, bronchus, thyroid, kidney
or prostate.

[START_SECTION]Degenerative
Rheumatoid arthritis
Women are more commonly affected than men. The usual symptoms are
pain, swelling and stiffness of the fingers. General malaise may occur.
The patient may complain of deformities of the fingers.

Vascular
Chilblains
The simplest vascular problem that affects the fingers is chilblains.
Women are more affected than men. The patient complains of a swelling
on the side or backs of the fingers, which develops rapidly after exposure
to cold. The lesion is painful and itches. The lesions are usually multiple
and occur most commonly in winter.

Small vessel disease
Ischaemia results in pain, discoloration, ulceration or frank gangrene.
The patient may complain of sudden onset of a cold, painful finger or
frank gangrene may be apparent. There may be a history of Raynaud’s
phenomenon, Buerger’s disease, diabetes or scleroderma. There may be
cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease or a cervical rib to suggest
embolism. With Raynaud’s phenomenon, there are often the
characteristic changes of sudden onset of pallor induced by exposure to
the cold, followed by cyanosis, followed by sudden vasodilatation with
a painful, tingling, red digit.

Metabolic
Gout
Gout usually affects the first MTP joint but may affect any joint. The
patient will complain of sudden onset of pain, swelling and redness in
relation to a joint. There may be a previous history of gout. There may

[START_SECTION]be a family history. An attack may be precipitated by trauma, starvation,
infection, diuretics, cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs. Gouty tophi
may be present.

Autoimmune
Scleroderma
Females are affected more than males. There may be thickening of the
fingers. The patient may also complain of Raynaud’s phenomenon and
splits and ulcers of the fingertips. There may be a change in facial
appearance and the patient may complain of dysphagia.

Neurological
Carpal tunnel syndrome
The patient will complain of pain, paraesthesia in the thumb, index and
middle fingers. Worse in bed at night. Relieved by hanging the arm out
of bed.

Cervical lesions
The patient may complain of pain or tingling in the fingers. There may
be a history of cervical spondylosis or other previous problems with the
cervical spine.

Examination
Traumatic
Deformity, redness and swelling to suggest a fracture will be obvious.
‘Trapping’ of the nail or a blow to it will cause a collection of blood
under the nail. The diagnosis is usually obvious from the history and the
patient will be in considerable pain.

Inflammatory/infective

[START_SECTION]Paronychia
The skin at the base and side of the nail is red, shiny and bulging. A bead
of pus may be seen discharging from under the nail.

Pulp space infection
There is swelling and redness over the pulp of the finger. A pus-filled
blister may be seen. If the tension is not rapidly relieved, it may either
discharge into the tendon sheath or may cause pressure necrosis and
osteomyelitis of the distal part of the terminal phalanx.

Tendon sheath infection
The finger is acutely painful and held in slight flexion. It is red and
swollen and exquisitely tender along the line of the tendon sheath.

Neoplastic
Glomus tumours
These are rare. They are angioneuromyomas. If the tumour occurs under
the nail (most common site), there is a small purple-red spot below the
nail.

Primary and secondary tumours
These are rare. There is palpable bony swelling, which may or may not
be tender.

Degenerative
Rheumatoid arthritis
The finger joints enlarge and become fusiform. Joint deformities occur,
with ulnar deviation at the wrist and hyperextension of the proximal
interphalangeal joints. There is wasting of muscles of the hand.

Vascular

[START_SECTION]Vascular
Chilblains
These usually occur on the dorsum and side of the fingers. The skin over
the swelling is reddish-blue. The swellings are oedematous and may
burst and ulcerate. There are usually chilblains on the ankles and feet as
well as on the fingers.

Small vessel disease
In ischaemic patients, there may be pallor, cyanosis or even frank
gangrene of a finger. Ischaemic ulcers may be apparent on the fingertips.
The pulp of the fingers may be wasted. Palpate for a cervical rib. Check
the pulse for atrial fibrillation (emboli).

Metabolic
Gout
Acute inflammation of a joint occurs, the skin being tense, shiny, hot and
red over the joint. The presence of gouty tophi locally or elsewhere, e.g.
on the ears, suggests the diagnosis.

Autoimmune
Scleroderma
The skin of the hands has a thickened, white, waxy appearance. The
fingers appear swollen with thickened skin, while the pulps of the
fingers may be wasted. Small subcutaneous nodules, which are hard,
may be palpable. These are due to calcinosis. Look for other signs of
scleroderma, e.g. the skin of the face looks tight and shiny and is
puckered around the mouth. There may be multiple telangiectasias over
the face. Evidence of weight loss due to dysphagia may be present.

Neurological
Carpal tunnel syndrome

[START_SECTION]Wasting of the thenar muscles. The reduction of sensation in distribution
of the median nerve in the hand occurring in advanced cases. Pressure
over the carpal tunnel may reproduce symptoms.

Cervical spondylosis
Check sensation in the fingers. Check also the range of neck movements
and the reflexes in the upper limbs.

General Investigations

• Referred pain to the fingers is not uncommon. This is
usually due to cervical spondylosis or carpal tunnel
syndrome. Always carry out a full neurological examination.
• Infection of the fingers and restriction of movement may
represent a tendon sheath infection. Antibiotics and urgent
referral are required.

[START_SECTION]Foot Deformities
These are not common. The deformity will often be apparent at birth but
occasionally does not present until the child starts walking. A deformity
of the foot and ankle is normally referred to as ‘talipes’. Other terms
may qualify the word talipes, e.g. varus (inverted heel), valgus (everted
heel) and equinus (foot plantar-flexed). Deformities of the toes are dealt
with under toe lesions (p. 458).

Causes
• Talipes equinovarus (congenital clubfoot)
• Metatarsus adductus (intoeing)
• Pes planus (flatfoot)
• Pes cavus (high-arch foot)
• Idiopathic
• Neuropathic
• Spastic dysplasia
• Spina bifida
• Spina bifida occulta
• Poliomyelitis
• Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (hereditary motor and
sensory neuropathy)
• Friedreich’s ataxia

• Cerebellar lesions
• Friedreich’s ataxia

Muscular Disease
• Muscular dystrophy
• Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture

Trauma
• Fractures
• Burns

History
Talipes equinovarus
Apparent at birth. The child is born with clubfoot. Picked up on routine
postnatal examination.

Metatarsus adductus
Common cause of intoeing in children. Only the forefoot is adducted and
not the hindfoot.

Pes planus
All children are flatfooted and the arches are not fully developed until
the age of ten. The parents may notice an abnormality of gait and
perhaps rapid and uneven wear and tear of the shoes. Pain is rare.

[START_SECTION]Pes cavus
There is accentuation of the longitudinal arch of the foot. There may be
pain and discomfort. Again, the condition may be noted by the child’s
parent. There may be no specific cause. Alternatively, there may be a
history of spina bifida, spina bifida occulta, poliomyelitis or rarely
Friedreich’s ataxia, for which there will be a family history. Charcot–
Marie–Tooth disease begins at puberty with foot drop and weakness in
the legs.

Acquired talipes
There are a variety of causes of upper and lower motor neurone lesions
giving rise to acquired talipes. Check for a history of spastic paresis,
cerebrovascular accident, spina bifida, poliomyelitis. There may be a
family history of Friedreich’s ataxia. The patient may be known to have
muscular dystrophy. With Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture, there will
be a history of ischaemia of the calf muscles, e.g. from supracondylar
fracture of the femur with popliteal artery damage.

Trauma
There will usually be an obvious history of trauma or of burns causing
contractures.

Examination
Talipes equinovarus
This will usually be apparent in the newborn. There is an equinus
deformity, i.e. the hindfoot is drawn up with a tight Achilles tendon;
varus deformity – the sole faces inwards; and adduction of the forefoot –
the inner border of the forefoot is concave and points upwards.

Metatarsus adductus

[START_SECTION]The hindfoot is normal with a normal sized heel. The forefoot is
adducted.

Pes planus
The longitudinal arch is flattened and the medial border of the foot rests
on the ground.

Pes cavus
The high arch is clearly visible. The toes are clawed due to
hyperextension of the MTP joints and flexion of the IP joints. The patient
cannot straighten the toes. Callosities usually develop under the
metatarsal heads. Check for spina bifida, spina bifida occulta (hairy
patch over lumbar spine), poliomyelitis. With Charcot–Marie–Tooth
disease, there will be foot drop and also atrophy of the peroneal
muscles. With Friedreich’s ataxia, there will be other signs, e.g. ataxia,
dysarthria and nystagmus.

Acquired talipes
Check for upper motor neurone and lower motor neurone lesions.
Friedreich’s ataxia (see above). Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture will
demonstrate firmness and wasting of the calf muscles together with
clawing of the foot.

Trauma
The deformity will depend on the type and severity of the trauma.
Scarring and contractures of burns will be obvious.

General Investigations
The diagnosis of nearly all of the above conditions is made on history
and clinical examination.

[START_SECTION]■ Foot X-rays
May help with assessment.
• Foot deformities are rare. Orthopaedic or neurological
referral is usually required.

[START_SECTION]Foot Pain
Pain in the foot is a common presenting complaint. The majority of
causes are related to either postural problems or arthritis.

• Ulcers

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 23 Foot pain due to chronic limb ischaemia with distal
gangsrene.

Metabolic
• Gout

Degenerative
• Osteoarthritis
• Flatfoot
• Other foot deformities (p. 160)

Other
• Corns and callosities
• Metatarsalgia
• Morton’s metatarsalgia
• Plantar warts
• Referred pain, e.g. disc lesions, neuropathies

History
Traumatic
History of trauma, e.g. heavy object falling on foot, crush injuries.
Fatigue or march fractures may occur with prolonged walking, e.g. as in
soldiers marching or in hikers. Severe pain may result. It usually affects
the second or third metatarsal bones. Track and field athletes are
particularly susceptible to stress fractures.

Infective

[START_SECTION]Cellulitis may occur following a puncture wound, e.g. standing on a
nail, insect bite. The history will usually be apparent. The patient will
present with a painful, red, swollen foot. Osteomyelitis is rare but may
follow blood-borne infection, e.g. with salmonella, or local infection,
especially in diabetics. There will be pain, tenderness, swelling and
redness over the affected bone. Pyogenic arthritis is rare but presents
with a painful, red, swollen joint.

Inflammatory
The foot is commonly involved in rheumatoid arthritis. Deformities are
multiple and eventually severe. There are usually signs of rheumatoid
arthritis elsewhere. Plantar fasciitis causes pain under the heel. The
patient is often middle aged. It may also be associated with Reiter’s
disease. The pain is often worse on standing after a period of rest.
Osteochondritis may affect the second metatarsal head (Freiberg’s
disease) or the navicular bone (Köhler’s disease). Pain, tenderness and
swelling occur in relation to the particular bone.

Vascular
There may be a history of intermittent claudication progressing to
ischaemic rest pain. The patient complains of severe pain in the foot,
usually in bed at night, which is relieved by hanging the foot out of bed.
The patient may also complain of ulcers and discoloration of the foot.
Gangrene may be apparent. Check for a history of smoking, diabetes.

Metabolic
Gout classically affects the first MTP joint but other joints of the foot
may be affected. There is acute onset of pain, redness and swelling.
There may be a previous history. Attacks may be precipitated by
trauma, surgery, infection or drugs, e.g. diuretics. There may also be a
history of leukaemia, polycythaemia and cytotoxic or
immunosuppressive therapy.

[START_SECTION]Degenerative
Osteoarthritis, flatfoot or other foot deformities (p. 160) may cause foot
pain. Hallux rigidus, i.e. primary osteoarthritis of the MTP joint of the
great toe, causes pain and stiffness.

Other
Metatarsalgia causes pain under the metatarsal heads. It is most
common in middle-aged women. Excessive standing triggers the
symptoms. Morton’s metatarsalgia is caused by a digital neuroma. It
most often affects the nerve running between the third and fourth
metatarsal heads. It is commonest in women aged 40–50 years. Sharp
intermittent pains shoot into the toes, usually occurring only when
shoes are worn. Plantar warts are painful. The patient will usually have
noticed the wart. They are common in the region of the metatarsal head,
great toe and heel. Corns and callosities over pressure points may be
painful. They are often associated with deformities of the foot. Referred
pain to the foot may occur due to spinal lesions. A history of backache
or weakness in the limb may be relevant.

Examination
Traumatic
Pain, tenderness, swelling, deformity or crepitus will be present with
fractures. With march fractures, there may be localised tenderness and
oedema on the dorsum of the foot.

Infective
Cellulitis, osteomyelitis and pyogenic arthritis will be associated with
fever, malaise and swelling, redness and tenderness of the foot.

Inflammatory

[START_SECTION]Rheumatoid arthritis may be associated with signs elsewhere, e.g.
hands. In the foot, there may be pes planus, hallux valgus, clawing of the
toes and subluxation at the MTP joints. With plantar fasciitis, there is
usually localised tenderness over the undersurface of the os calcis. With
Reiter’s disease, there may be urethritis and conjunctivitis. Freiberg’s
disease and Köhler’s disease present with swelling and tenderness over
the relevant bone.

Vascular
Look for signs of ischaemia, e.g. pallor, paraesthesia, loss of pulses,
ulcers, gangrene.

Metabolic
With gout, there will be swelling, redness and tenderness of the first
MTP joint. Gouty tophi may be present elsewhere.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis presents with pain and stiffness, e.g. hallux rigidus.
Flatfoot and other deformities may be apparent (p. 160).

Other
In metatarsalgia, there is tenderness under the metatarsal heads.
Callosities may be present under the metatarsal heads. In Morton’s
metatarsalgia, squeezing the forefoot may produce the symptoms.
Plantar warts (verruca plantaris) are usually obvious. They present as
flat, hyperkeratotic lesions, which seem to have been pushed into the
skin of the sole of the foot. In contrast to callosities, pressure over them
causes pain. If referred pain is suspected, a full neurological examination
should be carried out.

[START_SECTION]Foot Ulcers
Ulcers on the feet are common. The majority of them are of vascular or
neuropathic origin.

Causes
Vascular
Large Vessel Disease
• Arteriosclerosis
• Embolism

Small Vessel Disease
• Diabetes
• Buerger’s disease
• Raynaud’s disease
• Embolism
• Vasculitis, e.g. SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma

Neuropathic

• Syringomyelia

Neoplastic
• Squamous cell carcinoma

History
Vascular

[START_SECTION]Ischaemic ulcers are common in the elderly. They are painful and do not
bleed much. They show no signs of healing. There is often a history of
intermittent claudication and rest pain. Check for a history of diabetes.
In the younger patient, diabetes, Buerger’s disease or Raynaud’s disease
may be responsible. Check for a history of cardiac disease, which may
suggest embolism leading to ischaemic ulceration. Proximal arterial
disease, e.g. aneurysm, may also cause emboli.

Neuropathic
These are painless ulcers occurring over pressure points. Patients may
give a history of neuropathy. They may describe a feeling, as though
they are walking on cotton wool. Check for a history of diabetes and
peripheral nerve lesions. Spinal cord lesions may also be present. In
diabetes, ulceration may be associated with both ischaemia and
neuropathy.

Neoplastic
Malignant ulcers may occur on the foot. Squamous cell carcinoma is
rare but malignant melanoma is not infrequent, especially on the sole of
the foot. The patient may have noticed the pigmented lesion, which has
changed, with bleeding, itching and ulceration. The patient may also
have noticed a lump in the groin, suggesting lymph node secondaries.

Traumatic
Foot ulcers may be caused by minor trauma, e.g. ill-fitting shoes.
However, there is usually a history of an underlying predisposing
condition, e.g. poor circulation, steroid therapy, neuropathy.

Infective
Pure infective ulcers on the foot are rare. Infections may occur with
Nocardia species in tropical countries causing Madura foot. Check for a

[START_SECTION]history of foreign travel.

Examination
Vascular
Ischaemic ulcers are found on the tips of the toes and over the pressure
areas. The edge is usually punched out and healing does not occur. The
base may contain slough or dead tissue. Occasionally tendons are seen
in the base of the ulcer. Pulses may be absent. Check for atrial
fibrillation, which may be associated with embolism as a cause of
ischaemic ulceration.

Neuropathic
Neuropathic ulcers are deep, penetrating ulcers. They occur over
pressure areas but the surrounding tissues are healthy and have good
circulation. The ulcers themselves are painless. Examine the
surrounding tissues for blunting of sensation, e.g. absence of pinprick
sensation. Pulses are usually present. Carry out a full neurological
examination looking for peripheral nerve injuries or evidence of spinal
cord lesions.

Neoplastic
Squamous cell carcinomas have an everted edge, often with necrotic
material in the base of the ulcer. The edge of the ulcer is hard. Check for
inguinal lymphadenopathy. Ulcers associated with malignant
melanoma tend to vary from brown to black, although they may be
amelanotic. Bleeding and infection may make the surface of the tumour
appear wet, soft and boggy. Check for inguinal lymphadenopathy and
hepatomegaly.

Traumatic

[START_SECTION]Traumatic ulcers tend to occur either at pressure points, due to ill-fitting
footwear, or at a site of injury. They usually have sloping edges and
granulation tissue developing in the base. Always check the circulation,
as most traumatic foot ulcers readily heal unless there is an abnormality
of the circulation.

Infective
Infective ulcers by themselves are rare. Secondary infection may occur
on any type of ulcer. With Madura foot, there may be ulceration and
bone destruction with little systemic illness.

• Deep ulcers involving deep fascia, tendon and periosteum
are likely to have an arterial component.

[START_SECTION]Gait Abnormalities
Disorders of gait may be structural or neurological. When assessing
gait, it is important to observe the whole patient and not merely the feet.

Causes
Structural
• Pain – antalgic gait
• Length discrepancies – short leg gait
• Weak hip abductors – Trendelenburg or waddling gait
• Femoral anteversion – intoe gait

Neurological
• Stroke – hemiplegic gait
• Parkinson’s disease – festinant gait
• Multiple sclerosis – scissoring gait
• Peripheral neuropathy – sensory ataxia
• Cerebellar disease – cerebellar ataxia
• Peroneal nerve palsy – foot drop gait
• Cerebral palsy – scissoring gait
• Frontal lobe lesions – apraxic gait

History
Duration

[START_SECTION]An abnormality of gait that has been present since birth is usually due to
a structural cause or cerebral palsy. Discrepancies of length may
originate from disorders affecting joint articulation, bone length or from
soft-tissue contractures surrounding the joints. Most of the neurological
causes of gait abnormalities result from acquired lesions of the central
or peripheral nervous systems.

Associated symptoms
Pain is the underlying cause for the antalgic gait and patients will be
able to direct you to the site of origin of the pain. Loss of motor function
such as paralysis of dorsiflexion of the foot causes the foot drop gait,
more extensive paralysis of the arm and leg with the hemiplegic gait
may occur with stroke. Paraesthesia, sensory loss or impairment of joint
position sense is suggestive of peripheral neuropathy. Patients with
sensory apraxia suffer from proprioceptive impairment and have great
difficulties walking in the dark when visual cues are lost. A concomitant
resting tremor is associated with Parkinson’s disease and an intention
tremor results from cerebellar disease.

Past medical and drug history
A previous history of trauma to the lower limb is very significant;
fractures of the long bones predispose to length abnormalities on
healing. Fractures of the fibular neck may disrupt the common peroneal
nerve causing foot drop. Frontal lobe contusions may result from severe
head injuries. Diabetes, carcinoma and vitamin B deficiencies are
associated with peripheral neuropathies. Alcoholism, multiple sclerosis
and drugs such as phenytoin are associated with cerebellar impairment.
Direct questioning should be undertaken for previous strokes and
Parkinson’s disease.

Examination
The clinical examination is divided into three sections. The initial

[START_SECTION]examination of a gait disorder is to determine a structural or
neurological cause. If a structural lesion is suspected, then it is followed
by an orthopaedic examination. Conversely, a neurological examination
is performed if a neurological lesion is suspected. Once the disorder of
gait is defined, the clinical examination should then be tailored to
determine the underlying cause.

The asymmetrical gait
The gait is first assessed for symmetry. Apart from the hemiplegic gait,
the remaining unilateral gait disorders are structural. The normal gait
consists of several phases: there are the swing, heel strike, stance and
toe-off phases. The antalgic gait or painful limp is characterised by a
decrease in time spent in the stance phase. The Trendelenburg gait is
characterised by a downward tilt of the pelvis when the leg is lifted
forwards. It may be caused by a painful hip disorder, weakness of the
contralateral hip abductors, shortening of the femoral neck or
subluxation of the hip joint. With a hemiplegic gait, the leg swings in an
outward arc and then back to the midline. A foot drop gait often results
in the knee being lifted higher on the affected side.

The symmetrical gait
When analysing the symmetrical gait, observe movement of the whole
patient. The stooped posture with small shuffling steps and reduced arm
swing is characteristic of Parkinson’s disease. Patients with apraxia
have disjointed movements akin to ‘walking on ice’, the aetiology is
frontal lobe disorder, most commonly due to cortical degeneration.
Attention is then brought to the movement of the legs, scissoring of the
gait due to crossing of the midline when lifting the leg forwards is
associated with cerebral palsy and the spastic paraparesis of motor
involvement with multiple sclerosis. The movements of the feet are then
noted, lifting of the knees with slapping of the foot as it contacts with the
ground is descriptive of the foot drop gait. The foot is rotated inwards
with femoral anteversion. The base of the gait is then analysed, a broad-

[START_SECTION]based gait is characteristic of cerebellar disease and sensory ataxia.
With cerebellar disease, patients are unsteady standing with their eyes
open, while with sensory ataxia patients are able to stand with their eyes
open but not shut (positive Romberg’s test).

Orthopaedic examination
An examination of the hip, knee and ankle is required. Measurements
are undertaken to determine real and apparent length of the lower limbs.
The real length is the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine
and the medial malleolus, and the apparent length is the distance
between the xiphisternum and the medial malleolus. Any discrepancies
will require individual measurements of the femur and tibia to
determine the site of shortening. Thomas’ test is performed to identify
the presence of fixed flexion deformities of the hip that can give rise to
apparent shortening. The resting position of both feet can be inspected
and internal rotation due to femoral anteversion may be apparent.

Neurological examination
The mask-like facies and resting pill-rolling tremor of Parkinson’s
disease may be apparent on inspection, and examination of the limbs
will reveal cogwheel or lead pipe rigidity. Patients with cerebellar
disease will exhibit an intention tremor when performing the finger–
nose test; in addition to their broad-based ataxic gait, they may also
exhibit nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesia and dysarthria. With frontal
lobe disorders, primitive reflexes such as the grasping (the hand of the
examiner is grasped when placed or stroked along the patient’s palm),
sucking (sucking action is produced on stroking on side of the mouth)
and palmomental reflexes (gentle stroke of the thenar eminence
produces dimpling of the chin) are released. Examination of the sensory
system may reveal loss of light touch, vibration and proprioception in a
glove and stocking distribution with peripheral neuropathy. Unilateral
upper motor neurone weakness, hyperreflexia and clasp knife rigidity
are features of cortical strokes.

[START_SECTION]Specific examination

Once the diagnosis of a gait disorder is made, a specific examination is
now undertaken to determine the underlying aetiology. For example,
with apraxic gait due to frontal lobe disorder, a mental state
examination is performed to screen for dementia, and fundoscopy is
performed to screen for papilloedema, which may be indicative of raised
intracranial pressure from a brain tumour.

General Investigations
The diagnosis of the majority of gait abnormalities is made on clinical
history and examination.

Specific Investigations
■ Local X-rays
Structural causes.
■ Nerve conduction studies
Peripheral neuropathy. Peroneal nerve palsy.
■ CT/MRI scans
CNS causes, e.g. stroke, space-occupying lesions.
• When evaluating abnormalities of gait, it is important to
assess the patient in a safe environment, if necessary with an
assistant to hand to prevent falls or injury.
• Always observe the whole patient and not only the legs. The
cause may be central.
• Onset of ataxia without an obvious cause requires an urgent
neurological referral.

[START_SECTION]Goitre
A goitre is an enlargement of the thyroid gland (Fig. 25). It can result
from physiological causes such as puberty (due to increased demand for
thyroid hormone) which require no treatment, to frank malignant
disease requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment.

FIGURE 25 Endemic goitre. This condition, caused by iodine deficiency, is extremely
common in isolated mountainous regions. The thyroid may reach enormous size yet the
symptoms are minimal and the patient is usually euthyroid.

Causes
Simple (Non-Toxic) Goitre
• Simple hyperplastic goitre

[START_SECTION]• Multinodular goitre

Toxic Goitre
• Diffuse goitre (Graves’ disease)
• Toxic nodule
• Toxic multinodular goitre

Autoimmune
• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis

Neoplastic Goitre
Benign
• Adenoma

Malignant
• Papillary
• Follicular
• Anaplastic
• Medullary
• Lymphoma

Inflammatory
• de Quervain’s thyroiditis
• Riedel’s thyroiditis

History
Simple hyperplastic goitre
The patient presents with a swelling in the neck. Physiological causes
include puberty and pregnancy. Iodine deficiency is the most common
cause but is rare in the UK, where iodide is added to table salt. Where
the condition is endemic (often in isolated mountainous regions such as
Nepal), iodine deficiency is the usual cause.

[START_SECTION]Multinodular goitre
This is the commonest cause of goitre in the UK. It is more common in
women. The usual presentation is a lump in the neck, which moves on
swallowing, but with a very large gland, the patient may complain of
dyspnoea or dysphagia.

Toxic goitre
The patient presents with a lump in the neck. He or she may indicate a
preference for cold weather, and may also complain of excessive
sweating, tiredness, anxiety, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhoea,
palpitations and tremor.

Autoimmune
Hashimoto’s disease presents with a firm goitre. It needs to be
distinguished from lymphoma. Eventually, the patient becomes
hypothyroid, and will complain of intolerance to cold weather,
tiredness, a change in voice (hoarseness), weight gain, constipation, dry
skin and dry hair.

Neoplastic goitre
The patient may present with diffuse enlargement of the thyroid or may
have noticed a well-defined swelling in the area of the thyroid gland.
Papillary carcinoma occurs in the younger patient (under 35 years) and,
in addition to the goitre, the patient may have noticed lymph node
swelling in the neck. Follicular carcinoma occurs in middle age (40–60
years). The patient may also complain of bone pain due to metastases.
Anaplastic carcinoma occurs in the elderly. Anaplastic carcinoma may
present with stridor, dyspnoea and hoarseness. There may be gross
lymph node involvement. Medullary carcinoma can present at any age.
Check for a family history of medullary carcinoma and symptoms
related to phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism (associated

[START_SECTION]MEN syndrome). Lymphoma of the thyroid is rare and may develop in
pre-existing autoimmune (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis.

Inflammatory (rare)
The patient may present with a painful swelling of the thyroid
associated with malaise or myalgia (de Quervain’s thyroiditis). A hard
mass associated with dysphagia or dyspnoea may suggest Riedel’s
thyroiditis.

Examination
Simple hyperplastic goitre
The patient is usually euthyroid and the goitre is smooth. Where the
condition is endemic, the goiters are often asymmetrical and soft to
palpation. They are composed of many large hyperplastic nodules and
can reach enormous size (Fig. 25).

Multinodular goitre
The gland is usually smoothly nodular. Occasionally only one nodule
may be felt – the dominant nodule in a multinodular goitre. Check for
tracheal deviation when the gland is large, and percuss for retrosternal
extension.

Toxic goitre
Palpation of the gland may reveal a diffuse goitre, a multinodular goitre
or a solitary nodule. Check for exophthalmos, lid lag, lid retraction,
warm moist palms and tremor. Check for atrial fibrillation. Examine for
pretibial myxoedema. Reflexes are brisk. The goitre may have a palpable
thrill or a bruit may be heard on auscultation.

Autoimmune

[START_SECTION]Hashimoto’s disease presents with a diffusely enlarged, firm gland.
Eventually, there may be signs of hypothyroidism. These signs include a
pale, waxy skin, periorbital oedema, dry thickened skin and hair, slow
pulse, large tongue, peripheral oedema and slow relaxing reflexes.
Carpal tunnel syndrome may be present.

Neoplastic goitre
There may be a solitary thyroid nodule (papillary carcinoma) or a more
diffuse mass (follicular carcinoma). Anaplastic carcinoma is hard and
irregular and invades locally. Check for tracheal deviation. Cervical
lymphadenopathy may be present with a papillary carcinoma, when the
glands are usually mobile and discrete, and is invariably associated
with anaplastic carcinoma, where the glands may be hard and matted.
Check for recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy – has the patient got a hoarse
voice or is unable to produce an occlusive cough?

Inflammatory
Subacute thyroiditis (rare). There will be a painful, swollen gland. In
Riedel’s thyroiditis, there is a woody, hard goitre, which infiltrates into
adjacent muscle. It must be carefully differentiated from anaplastic
carcinoma.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ in disseminated malignancy. ESR ↑ in thyroiditis.
■ TFTs
T4 ↑, TSH ↓ in toxic goitre. T4 ↓, TSH ↑ in hypothyroidism.

• Dysphagia or dyspnoea in association with a goitre requires
urgent referral and may require urgent thyroidectomy.

[START_SECTION]Groin Swellings
These are common clinical problems, especially hernias. They are
therefore common in clinical examinations.

Causes
Above The Inguinal Ligament
• Sebaceous cyst
• Lipoma
• Direct inguinal hernia
• Indirect inguinal hernia (Fig. 26)
• Imperfectly descended testis
• Lipoma of the cord
• Hydrocele of the cord
• Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck

FIGURE 26 A large left indirect inguinal hernia extending into the
scrotum.

[START_SECTION]Below The Inguinal Ligament
• Sebaceous cyst
• Lipoma
• Femoral hernia
• Lymph nodes
• Saphena varix
• Femoral artery aneurysm (true or false)
• Imperfectly descended testis
• Neuroma of the femoral nerves
• Synovioma of the hip joint
• Obturator hernia
• Psoas abscess

History
Sebaceous cyst
The patient will complain of a mobile lump on the skin. It may be red
and inflamed and discharging.

Lipoma
The patient will present with a soft, painless swelling.

Hernias
A patient with a groin hernia will present with a lump that disappears
on recumbency or may be pushed back (reducible). The patient may
present with a tense, tender lump that will not reduce and is
accompanied by signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Femoral
hernia is more common in females. With hernias, there is occasionally a
history of sudden straining or trauma, following which a lump may

[START_SECTION]become manifest.

Imperfectly descended testis
An imperfectly descended testis may present as a groin swelling. The
patient, or, if in a young child, the mother, will have noticed absence of a
testis from the scrotum. Enlargement and pain may indicate malignant
change, which is more common in an imperfectly descended testis.

Lipoma of the cord
The patient will have noticed a soft swelling in the groin. This is often
mistaken for a hernia.

Hydrocele of the cord
This may present as a lump in the inguinal region which does not
reduce.

Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck
This is similar to a hydrocele of the spermatic cord but presents in the
female. It represents a cyst forming in the processus vaginalis.

Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes may present as swellings below the inguinal ligament.
They may be discrete and firm, tender and red or matted to form a mass.
The patient may have noticed a lesion on the leg. Care must be taken to
elicit a full history with inguinal lymphadenopathy, as the nodes drain
not only the tissues of the leg but also the penis, the scrotal skin, the
lower half of the anal canal, the skin of the buttock and the skin of the
lower abdominal wall, up to and including the umbilicus. In the female,
they drain the labia, the lower third of the vagina and the fundus of the
uterus, via lymphatics accompanying the round ligament down the

[START_SECTION]inguinal canal. A careful history should therefore be taken, of any
anorectal disease, e.g. bleeding PR, or gynaecological disease, e.g.
bleeding PV to suggest a carcinoma of the uterus.

Saphena varix
A saphena varix is normally associated with varicose veins lower down
the leg. The patient will present having noticed a small, soft, bluish mass
in the lower part of the groin.

Femoral artery aneurysm
A pulsatile expansile mass suggests a femoral aneurysm. Check for a
history of arterial surgery at the groin or arteriography via the femoral
artery, which may suggest the presence of a false aneurysm.

Imperfectly descended testis
An imperfectly descended testis may descend into the upper thigh but its
descent is arrested by the attachment of Scarpa’s fascia to the deep fascia
of the thigh.

Neuroma of the femoral nerve
This is rare and may be associated with anaesthesia or paraesthesia on
the anterior aspect of the thigh and inability to extend the knee.

Synovioma of the hip joint
This is rare. The patient complains of a lump deep in the groin, which
may interfere with hip movement.

Obturator hernia
This is rare. The sac passes through the obturator canal and may present

[START_SECTION]in the groin deep to pectineus. A lump is rarely palpable due to the
overlying pectineus. The diagnosis is not usually made until obstruction
or strangulation occurs.

Examination
Sebaceous cyst
This is attached to the skin and a punctum is usually seen at the point of
attachment. Sebaceous cysts are firm, spherical and mobile on the
underlying tissue. They may be hot, red and tender when inflamed.

Lipoma
The lump will be soft, lobulated, mobile, being fixed neither to the skin
nor to the underlying tissue. They may be distinguished from hernias, in
that they are not reducible and do not have a cough impulse.

Hernias
A hernia may be reduced and has an expansile cough impulse. They may
be irreducible. Irreducible hernias may be: (1) incarcerated – imprisoned
in the sac because of adhesions between contents and the wall of the sac;
(2) obstructed – small bowel is caught in the sac and intestinal contents
cannot pass on; (3) strangulated – the arterial blood supply is cut-off and
gangrene of the contents ensues. In the last case, the lump would be
tender, the overlying skin may be red and the patient will be pyrexial
with a tachycardia. There will be signs of intestinal obstruction.
It is important to distinguish between an inguinal and a femoral
hernia. An inguinal hernia lies above and medial to the pubic tubercle, a
femoral hernia below and lateral. An inguinal hernia may be either
direct or indirect. An indirect hernia comes down the inguinal canal
from the deep inguinal ring. A direct hernia comes through the posterior
wall of the canal, through Hesselbach’s triangle (base – inguinal
ligament; lateral border – inferior epigastric artery; medial border – the

[START_SECTION]lateral border of rectus abdominis muscle). Distinction between direct
and indirect hernia is made by reducing the hernia and exerting pressure
over the deep inguinal ring, asking the patient to cough. If the hernia sac
appears medial to the fingers, it is direct. If the hernia appears only after
removing the pressure over the deep inguinal ring, then it is indirect.

Imperfectly descended testis
An imperfectly descended testis may be in an ectopic position (root of
the penis, upper thigh or perineum) or along the normal line of descent.
An imperfectly descended testis cannot be felt in the inguinal canal – it
is usually too flabby and atrophic and cannot be palpated through the
tough overlying external oblique aponeurosis. However, should it
become malignant, then the hard and irregular testis can be palpated in
the inguinal canal. An imperfectly descended testis may also be palpable
in the upper thigh below the inguinal ligament. The scrotum will be
empty on that side. The testis cannot descend more than a few
centimetres into the upper thigh, as its descent is prevented by the
attachment of Scarpa’s fascia to the deep fascia of the thigh below the
inguinal ligament. An imperfectly descended testis may also be palpable
at the root of the penis or in the perineum.

Lipoma of the cord
This can be confidently diagnosed only at surgery, although there will
not be an expansile cough impulse as with a hernia.

Hydrocele of the cord
This is rare. There will be a smooth, palpable swelling along the line of
the cord. It does not have a palpable expansile cough impulse. If gentle
traction is exerted on the testis, a hydrocele of the cord will be felt to
move down the canal. It may transilluminate.

[START_SECTION]Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck
A swelling, similar to a hydrocele of the cord in the male, occurring in
the female is called a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. Findings will be
similar to those of a hydrocele of the cord in the male, except there is
nothing to exert traction on!

Femoral hernia
This is more common in females. It lies below and lateral to the pubic
tubercle. There will be an expansile cough impulse. It may be reducible.
Strangulation of a femoral hernia is not uncommon, particularly one of
the Richter’s type. A tense, tender, irreducible swelling will be found
below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.

Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes are palpable below the inguinal ligament. Classically,
they are arranged into groups: (1) superficial, with subdivision into
horizontal and vertical groups; and (2) deep. In practice, it is difficult to
distinguish between the groups. Lymph nodes in the groin may be
palpable as discrete nodules or they may be hard, irregular and matted
together. This type is usually associated with malignant disease. Tender,
fluctuant lymph nodes with erythema of the overlying skin are usually
associated with lymphadenopathy due to an infective condition. It is
important to examine all sites that are drained by these nodes, namely:
(1) the skin of the leg, including examination under the toe nails; (2) the
skin of the buttock; (3) the skin of the lower abdominal wall up to and
including the umbilicus; (4) the skin of the scrotum, penis and glans
penis; (5) the labia and lower third of the vagina; (6) the lower half of the
anal canal; (7) the fundus of the uterus. It is therefore necessary not only
to examine superficial structures but also to carry out a digital rectal
examination and a bimanual vaginal examination.

[START_SECTION]Saphena varix
This is a soft, compressible dilatation at the termination of the
saphenous vein. It has a cough impulse and disappears on recumbency.
A fluid thrill is felt if the veins lower down the leg are percussed.

Femoral artery aneurysm
A femoral artery aneurysm presents as an expansile pulsatile mass in
the line of the femoral artery. Look for a scar in relationship to it, which
may suggest a false aneurysm.

Imperfectly descended testis
An imperfectly descended testis may be palpable in the upper thigh
below the inguinal ligament. The scrotum will be empty on that side.
The testis cannot descend more than a few centimetres into the upper
thigh, as its descent is prevented by the attachment of Scarpa’s fascia to
the deep fascia of the thigh below the inguinal ligament.

Neuroma of the femoral nerve
This is rare. It will be palpable along the course of the nerve (lateral to
the femoral artery). Test the integrity of the femoral nerve (sensation on
the anterior aspect of the thigh; extension of the knee joint).

Synovioma of the hip joint
This is rare. There may be a palpable thickening deep in the groin in
relation to the hip joint. Hip joint movements may be limited.

Obturator hernia
This is rare. In a very thin patient, a lump may be felt deep in the medial
aspect of the groin. More commonly, obturator hernias present with

[START_SECTION]intestinal obstruction and the diagnosis is made at laparotomy.

Psoas abscess
This is rare. It used to be associated with spinal TB, a cold abscess of a
vertebral body discharging down the psoas sheath and presenting as a
soft fluctuant swelling below the inguinal ligament. Most psoas
abscesses nowadays are related to perforation of a hollow viscus
retroperitoneally, e.g. the right colon into the psoas sheath.

General Investigations
The diagnosis of most groin swellings is made on history and physical
examination.

[START_SECTION]Gum Disorders
Disorders of the gums are common, especially bleeding from the gums.
Most disorders that cause bleeding are due to local infective disease but
may be a manifestation of systemic disease.

Causes
Bleeding
• Dental disease
• Infection
• Bacterial
• Viral
• Fungal
• Blood dyscrasias
• Iatrogenic
• Anticoagulants
• Chemotherapy
• Radiotherapy

Hypertrophy
• Infection associated with dental disease
• Drugs
• Phenytoin
• Nifedipine
• Ciclosporin (Fig. 27)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 27 Gingival hyperplasia.
The patient had received a kidney transplant nine months earlier and was
on the anti-rejection drug ciclosporin.

Retraction
• Chronic periodontal disease
• Ageing

Others
• Malignancy (ulcers)
• Lead poisoning
• Arsenic poisoning

History
Periodontal disease is probably the most common factor causing
bleeding from the gums. Poor hygiene is usually obvious from the
condition of the teeth. Infection will cause the patient to complain of red,
inflamed gums, which bleed spontaneously or on brushing the teeth.
Patients may have a history of recent malignancy for which they have
undergone either chemotherapy, with associated blood dyscrasia, or
local radiotherapy. There may be a history of painful lesions in the
mouth to suggest herpes simplex. Rarely, infectious mononucleosis may
cause gingivostomatitis. The patient may present with a pyrexial illness

[START_SECTION]with malaise, lethargy and lymphadenopathy. Abnormalities of the
bone marrow, e.g. malignant infiltration or aplastic anaemia will result
in agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Agranulocytosis causes
reduced resistance to infection; thrombocytopenia is associated with a
bleeding tendency. There may be a generalised illness with malaise and
lethargy associated with lymphadenopathy, bruising and spontaneous
bleeding from other orifices. There may be a history of haemophilia or
von Willebrand’s disease. Rarer conditions include scurvy (subclinical
vitamin C deficiency may occur in the elderly) and hereditary
haemorrhagic telangiectasia. Check for a family history of bleeding
disorders. A full drug history should be taken. Check whether the patient
is on phenytoin, nifedipine or ciclosporin. Check for occupational
exposure to chemicals, especially arsenic and lead.

Examination
Local
Inspect the gums for signs of inflammation and bleeding. Is it only the
gums that are involved or does the condition affect the whole of the oral
cavity? Check the condition of the teeth, looking for dental caries or
periodontal disease. Is there any evidence of gingival hyperplasia? In
gingival hyperplasia, the gum hypertrophy predominantly involves the
interdental papillae. Is there any localised ulceration of the gum to
suggest neoplasia? Is there any evidence of gum retraction? This occurs
commonly in ageing but may be associated with chronic periodontal
disease. Arsenic and lead are rare causes of gingival bleeding. The
gingiva become inflamed, swollen and bleed easily, and, in the case of
lead, there is a characteristic blue line at the gingival margin. Other
signs of lead poisoning may be present, particularly pigmentation of the
skin, vomiting, diarrhoea and hyperkeratosis of the soles of the feet and
the palms of the hands. Peripheral neuropathy may be present with
arsenic poisoning.

[START_SECTION]General
Conduct a general examination of the patient. Is there any evidence of
systemic disease? Check for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly
and generalised bruising. Check for telangiectasia.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ malignancy, malnutrition. WCC ↑ infection. WCC ↓ blood
dyscrasias, chemotherapy. ESR ↑ malignancy, infection. Platelets ↓

Dyscrasias, anticoagulants.
■ Vitamin C level
Scurvy.
■ Biopsy
Malignant ulcers.
• Take a careful drug history. Iatrogenic causes of gum
soreness and bleeding are easy to overlook.
• Petechiae of the soft palate in conjunction with gingivitis
raises the possibility of acute leukaemia.
• If blood dyscrasia is a possible diagnosis, carry out a full
blood count.

[START_SECTION]Gynaecomastia
Gynaecomastia is enlargement of the male breast. There is an increase
in the ductal and connective tissue elements of the breast. The condition
should not be confused with fat in the mammary region, which may
occur in obese patients and in old age with weight loss. In most cases,
gynaecomastia is a result of an increase in the oestrogen–androgen
ratio. In many cases, the actual mechanism is unknown or the cause is
idiopathic.

Causes
Physiological
• Neonates
• Puberty
• Old age

Pathological
• Drugs
■ Oestrogens
■ Cyproterone
■ Spironolactone
■ Cimetidine
■ Digitalis
■ Griseofulvin
■ Amphetamines
■ Tricyclic antidepressants
■ Cannabis

[START_SECTION]• Chronic liver disease (especially alcohol) (Fig. 28)

• Bronchial carcinoma (inappropriate secretion of
hormones)
• Pituitary tumours (e.g. prolactinoma)
• Malnutrition
• Idiopathic

FIGURE 28 Gynaecomastia in a young man with chronic hepatitis. Note
also that the patient is jaundiced.

History
In newborn babies, gynaecomastia is associated with placental
oestrogens and may be associated with a milky discharge from the
nipple (witch’s milk). Is the patient pubertal? A minor degree of

[START_SECTION]gynaecomastia occurs in a majority of boys prior to puberty. This often
regresses but occasionally remains and is a source of embarrassment.
Senescent gynaecomastia occurs in the sixth decade or later.
Most cases of gynaecomastia present as painless or tender
enlargement of one or both breasts. The majority of pathological causes
of gynaecomastia are related to drugs. A careful drug history should be
taken. Is there a history to suggest hypogonadism, e.g. undescended
testes, bilateral torsion, Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY – tall, female
distribution of fat around breast and pelvis, normal male hair
distribution, atrophic testes). Has the patient noticed any testicular
swelling? Check for a history of alcoholism or hepatitis, which might
suggest liver failure. Is the patient in chronic renal failure? This will
usually be apparent as he will have been on some form of dialysis. Are
there any signs of hyperthyroidism? Has the patient noticed any visual
disturbance to suggest a pituitary tumour involving the optic chiasma?

Examination
Local
One or both breasts may be involved. Enlargement may be considerable,
resembling a female breast, but this is rare; it is usually small and
localised behind the areolar. The swelling may be soft or hard. In the
younger male, the hard enlargement is usually confined to a disc of
tissue behind the areola and this usually occurs around puberty. Hard
irregular enlargement in an elderly man should raise the diagnosis of
carcinoma. Soft or diffuse enlargement is usually associated with drugs.

General
Examine the axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Examine the
testes – atrophic or enlarged (tumour). Check for signs for
hyperthyroidism, liver failure or renal failure. The patient may have a
CAPD tube or an arteriovenous fistula for treatment of chronic renal
failure.

areola.

[START_SECTION]• In a patient with gynaecomastia, always examine the testes.
There may be an underlying testicular tumour. If there is any
doubt, carry out an ultrasound scan.
• Gynaecomastia associated with headache and visual
disturbance may be caused by a pituitary tumour, e.g.
prolactinoma. In a smoker with gynaecomastia and clubbing
of the fingers, bronchial carcinoma is a likely diagnosis.
• Always take a full drug history, especially recreational
drugs.

[START_SECTION]Haematemesis
Haematemesis is the vomiting of blood. This may be frank blood or
blood altered by the action of gastric acid and digestive enzymes, i.e.
‘coffee grounds’. Haematemesis is usually caused by lesions proximal to
the duodenojejunal junction.

Causes
Swallowed Blood
• Epistaxis
• Haemoptysis

Oesophagus
• Reflux oesophagitis
• Oesophageal varices (Fig. 29)

• Connective tissue disorders

[START_SECTION]History
Swallowed blood
Check for a recent history of epistaxis or haemoptysis.

Oesophagus
There may be a history of excess alcohol consumption or a history of
other liver disease to suggest oesophageal varices. A history of
retrosternal burning pain and heartburn would suggest oesophagitis.
The bleeding associated with varices is often torrential; that associated
with oesophagitis is minor. Check for a history of dysphagia, which can
result from carcinoma.

Stomach
History of epigastric pain to suggest peptic ulceration. There may be a
history of steroid or NSAID medication. Mallory–Weiss syndrome
usually occurs in the younger patient who has had a large meal with a
large quantity of alcohol, followed by a forceful vomit. The first vomit
contains food, the second contains blood. Acute gastric erosions may
occur with stressful illnesses, e.g. major surgery, acute pancreatitis,
burns (Curling’s ulcer) or head injuries (Cushing’s ulcer). It is unusual to
get a large bleed with a carcinoma. Anaemia is a common presentation,
although there may be ‘coffee grounds’ vomit. Leiomyoma causes a
moderate haematemesis. There is usually no preceding history. There
will also be no preceding history with vascular malformations.
Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is rare. The patient may present
with a history of the condition, or it may be apparent from the
telangiectasia around the lips and oral cavity.

Duodenum
Melaena tends to be a more common symptom than haematemesis with

[START_SECTION]duodenal lesions. There may be a history of chronic duodenal
ulceration, although often presentation may be acute with little
background history. Bleeding from invasive pancreatic tumours is rare.
The patient will present with malaise, lethargy, weight loss and
vomiting. Haemobilia is rare. Aortoduodenal fistula is rare and usually
follows repair of an aneurysm, with subsequent infection of the graft.
There is massive haematemesis and melaena.

Bleeding disorders
The patient may present with a history of a bleeding disorder, e.g.
haemophilia. There may be a history of spontaneous bruising or
bleeding from other orifices.

Drugs
There may be a history of anticoagulant, steroid or NSAID therapy.
Always question the patient carefully to see whether he or she has
bought any proprietary, ‘over-the-counter’ preparations that may
contain aspirin or NSAIDs.

Others
Uraemia may cause bleeding. Other symptoms such as dyspnoea,
nausea, malaise, peripheral oedema or coma may be present. Rarely,
gastrointestinal bleeding may be a presenting symptom of a connective
tissue disease.

Examination
Depending upon the severity of the bleed, there may be shock. The
patient will be cold, clammy, with peripheral vasoconstriction; there
will be a tachycardia and hypotension.

[START_SECTION]Swallowed blood
Check for blood around the nose. Examine the chest for a possible cause
of haemoptysis.

Oesophagus
There may be little to find on examination, except clinical signs of
anaemia and weight loss, unless the cause is oesophageal varices. In the
latter case, there may be jaundice, abdominal distension due to ascites,
spider naevi, liver palms, clubbing, gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy,
caput medusae, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly.

Stomach
There may be little to find on examination. There may be an epigastric
mass with a carcinoma or a palpable left supraclavicular node
(Virchow’s node). There may be epigastric tenderness. With hereditary
haemorrhagic telangiectasia, there may be telangiectasia on the lips and
mucous membrane of the mouth.

Duodenum
Again, there may be little to find on examination other than epigastric
tenderness. In the rare case where duodenal bleeding comes from an
invasive pancreatic carcinoma, there may be a palpable mass in the
region of the pancreas.

Bleeding disorders
There may be signs of bruising or bleeding from other orifices.

Drugs
The signs will depend on the severity of the bleed and the site of the

[START_SECTION]lesion produced.

Others
There may be signs of uraemia, e.g. pallor, bronze colour of the skin,
pulmonary oedema, peripheral oedema, pericarditis, cardiac
tamponade, hypertension, retinopathy. Rarely, haematemesis may be
associated with connective tissue diseases, e.g. polyarteritis nodosa.
Other manifestations of polyarteritis nodosa may be apparent, e.g.
neuropathies, cardiac disease or skin lesions.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ anaemia due to chronic bleeding, e.g. from carcinoma. ESR ↑
connective tissue disease.
■ U&Es
Urea and creatinine will be raised in uraemia. Urea may be raised due to
absorption of blood from the bowel.
■ LFTs
Liver failure, oesophageal varices, haemobilia.
■ Clotting screen
Liver disease. Bleeding diatheses. Anticoagulants.
■ OGD
Will demonstrate most lesions, e.g. varices, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer,
gastric erosions, Mallory–Weiss tear, carcinoma and rarer causes of
bleeding. Biopsy may be carried out where necessary.

Vascular malformations. Also may diagnose rarer distal duodenal
causes, e.g. vascular malformations.
■ US

[START_SECTION]Aortic aneurysm.
■ CXR
Chest lesion.
■ CT

• When assessing a patient with haematemesis, it is important
to secure intravenous access with a large-bore cannula and to
send blood for cross-matching as soon as possible.
• Always take a careful drug history, especially of ‘over-thecounter’ drugs.
• Tachycardia may be the only physical sign of a significant
GI bleed, especially in the younger patient.

[START_SECTION]Haematuria
Haematuria is the passage of red blood cells in the urine. Care must be
taken to distinguish it from other causes of discoloration of urine. All
patients with haematuria must be fully investigated. If haematuria has
initially been diagnosed on dipstick testing, it must always be confirmed
by microscopy.

Causes

• Stone
• Trauma (including renal biopsy)
• Polycystic kidney

[START_SECTION]Red Urine
• Haemoglobinuria
• Myoglobinuria
• Acute intermittent porphyria
• Beetroot
• Senna
• Phenolphthalein
• Rifampicin

History
Is there pain associated with haematuria to suggest infection or
inflammation? Painless haematuria is usually associated with tumour or
TB. Total haematuria (throughout the stream) suggests bleeding from
the upper urinary tract or bladder. Initial haematuria (at the start of the
stream) suggests bleeding from the urethra or the prostate. Terminal
haematuria (at the end of the stream) suggests bleeding from the bladder
or prostate. Check for a family history of polycystic kidney disease.
There may be a history of TB elsewhere. Has there been any recent
foreign travel (schistosomiasis)? Is there any pain in the loin to suggest
kidney disease, or a history of ureteric colic to suggest passage of a
stone or clot down the ureter? Bladder disease may be accompanied by
suprapubic pain, frequency and dysuria. Catheter-associated haematuria
may occur in patients with long-term indwelling bladder catheters. It is
usually self-limiting. Check for symptoms of prostatism, i.e. difficulty in
starting, poor stream and nocturia. Urethral injury will normally be
apparent. It may occur following pelvic fractures or falling astride an
object. Is the patient on anticoagulants? Is there any history of blood
dyscrasia? Is there evidence of sickle cell disease or exposure to
malaria? Strenuous exercise may cause haematuria. Has there been a
recent renal biopsy? Discoloration of urine may be due to a variety of
causes. Haemoglobinuria may occur with haemolysis and

[START_SECTION]myoglobinuria following crush injuries or ischaemia of muscle. Check
for ingestion of any substance that may change the colour of the urine.
Acute intermittent porphyria is extremely rare and is accompanied by
abdominal pain. If the urine from a patient is allowed to stand in the
light, it will become purplish-red.

Examination
Anaemia, weight loss, signs of chronic renal failure. Abdominal
examination may reveal a palpable mass, e.g. hypernephroma, distended
bladder. Rectal examination may reveal smooth enlargement of the
prostate (benign prostatic hypertrophy) or a hard, craggy prostate
(carcinoma). Feel along the course of the urethra, e.g. stone or neoplasm.
Examine the chest, e.g. TB, secondary deposits from carcinoma of the
kidney. Check for any localised bone tenderness, e.g. secondary deposits
from carcinoma of the prostate or hypernephroma.

instance.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Haemoptysis
Haemoptysis is the expectoration of blood or bloodstained sputum. With
massive haemoptysis, the main priorities are to secure the airway and
initiate emergency resuscitative measures before establishing a
diagnosis.

Causes
Respiratory
• Bronchial carcinoma
• Pneumonia
• TB (worldwide) (Fig. 31)
• Chronic bronchitis
• Bronchiectasis
• Pulmonary oedema
• Goodpasture’s syndrome
• Wegener’s granulomatosis

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 31 Chest X-ray of a patient with widespread tuberculosis.
Note the multiple small areas of consolidation (arrows).

Vascular
• Pulmonary embolism
• Pulmonary hypertension – mitral stenosis
• Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia

Systemic
• Coagulation disorders

History
Onset
Sudden onset of haemoptysis can occur with pulmonary embolism and
acute respiratory tract infections; the remaining conditions tend to
pursue chronic recurrent courses. Although the amount of blood
expectorated is not very useful as a discriminating feature, small
amounts of blood sufficient to stain the sputum pink are characteristic of
pulmonary oedema.
Acute onset of cough with haemoptysis may occur with respiratory
tract infections and pulmonary embolism. Associated sputum

[START_SECTION]production may be purulent and longstanding with chronic bronchitis
and bronchiectasis. This is accompanied by flecks of blood when lung
carcinoma, TB or mitral stenosis is present.

Dyspnoea
A long history of dyspnoea may be associated with chronic lung disease
or mitral stenosis. Acute onset of dyspnoea that occurs with pulmonary
embolism may be accompanied by pleuritic chest pain. Dyspnoea that is
associated with pulmonary oedema may have a variable speed of onset
and is often worse on recumbency.

Weight loss
Progressive weight loss is suggestive of TB or bronchial carcinoma,
especially with a background of heavy smoking. Night sweats may be
an additional accompanying feature of TB.

Other sites of bleeding
Other bleeding sites should be excluded as haematuria may be due to
Goodpasture’s syndrome. Epistaxis and haemoptysis occur together
with Wegener’s granulomatosis and hereditary haemorrhagic
telangiectasia. Epistaxis per se may occasionally be confused with
haemoptysis when expectorated sputum is mixed with blood originating
from the nasal passages.

Past medical and drug history
A careful history is taken to identify a generalised coagulation disorder.
This may be congenital, such as haemophilia, or acquired, such as with
the use of anticoagulant drugs or in DIC. Previous rheumatic fever
predisposes an individual to mitral stenosis. Consider Goodpasture’s
syndrome and Wegener’s granulomatosis in the presence of co-existing
renal disease.

[START_SECTION]Examination
Inspection
Cachexia is a prominent feature of carcinoma, TB and chronic lung
disease. Loss of the nasal bridge and saddling of the nose may be
apparent in patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis. The presence of
clubbing (p. 64) is associated with bronchial carcinoma, chronic
bronchitis and bronchiectasis. The malar flush characteristic of mitral
facies may be present with mitral stenosis. Small dilated blood vessels
present on the mucous membranes are features of hereditary
haemorrhagic telangiectasia. The JVP may be elevated with a large
pulmonary embolus or accompanying congestive cardiac failure
secondary to mitral stenosis. The chest may be hyperexpanded with
decreased inspiratory movement in chronic bronchitis.

Palpation
During an acute episode, tachycardia is very common. This may be due
to the effort of coughing, anxiety or blood loss. The presence of an
irregular heartbeat of atrial fibrillation is associated with mitral
stenosis. Moreover, patients with atrial fibrillation are usually on
anticoagulant therapy. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy may be
present with pulmonary infections or carcinoma. The calves should be
palpated and measured for tenderness and increased girth from deep
venous thrombosis, which may give rise to pulmonary emboli.

Percussion and auscultation
Localised crepitations and bronchial breathing may be audible with
lobar pneumonia. Generalised coarse crepitations are suggestive of
bronchiectasis, pulmonary oedema and chronic bronchitis. Breath
sounds tend to be decreased in intensity with chronic bronchitis.
Patients with bronchial carcinoma may present with a number of
clinical features from the primary tumour, such as wheezing due to

[START_SECTION]large airway obstruction, pulmonary collapse, pleural effusion and
superior vena cava obstruction. On auscultation of the mitral area, the
loud first heart sound and mid-diastolic rumbling murmur of mitral
stenosis is accentuated on expiration with the patient in a left lateral
position.

General Investigations
■ Sputum analysis
Sputum should be collected for microscopy, culture and cytology.
Infective organisms may be isolated or cytological features of
malignancy may be present. When TB is suspected, serial cultures
should be taken from sputum, urine, bronchial washings or lung biopsy
specimens during bronchoscopy. Polymerase chain reaction
amplification techniques may also be performed on cultured specimens
to provide a more rapid diagnosis.
■ ECG
Sinus tachycardia may be noted with violent coughing, anxiety and
blood loss. S1Q3T3 is indicative of right heart strain with pulmonary
embolism, although non-specific ST abnormalities are more common.
■ FBC
Hb ↓ with chronic haemoptysis resulting in iron deficiency anaemia.
Acute bleeding may not be associated with changes in the blood count
until 24 hours later. WCC ↑ may be due to acute bleeding or respiratory
tract infection. Monocytosis may be a feature of TB. Platelets ↓ with
blood dyscrasias.
■ U&Es
The presence of impaired renal function with deranged urea and
creatinine estimations may be due to glomerulonephritis from
Goodpasture’s syndrome or Wegener’s granulomatosis. However, prerenal failure may also be precipitated by acute blood loss and volume
depletion.
■ Clotting screen
A clotting screen is performed to identify any impairment that may

[START_SECTION]prolong the PT or APTT.
■ CXR
Bilateral patchy areas of consolidation may be seen on a chest film with
bronchopneumonia and pulmonary oedema. Opacification of an entire
lobe suggests lobar pneumonia, although pulmonary emboli may have a
similar appearance due to the wedge-shaped shadowing of a pulmonary
infarct. Recurrent fluffy shadowing may be seen with Goodpasture’s
syndrome and Wegener’s granulomatosis, due to repeated intra-alveolar
haemorrhage. The primary focus of tuberculous infection is usually in
the middle to upper zones of the lung. This may resolve, with variable
amounts of calcification, whereas post-primary TB tends to present with
the classical apical shadow. The chest film may be normal with
uncomplicated chronic bronchitis; however, with bronchiectasis, visibly
dilated bronchi with persistent consolidation may be prominent. With
bronchial carcinoma, numerous features may be seen on a chest
radiograph, such as a peripheral mass, a hilar mass, collapse of a lobe or
pleural effusion. The double right heart border and tenting of the left
heart border are all features of enlargement of the left atrium with mitral
stenosis. When pulmonary hypertension is present, there may be
dilatation of the central pulmonary arteries with right ventricular
enlargement.
■ Bronchoscopy
Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is useful for locating the site of bleeding. In
addition, biopsies of the bleeding site may be sampled for pathological
analysis. Multiple arteriovenous malformations will be visible with
hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Specific Investigations
■ Mantoux test
When TB is suspected, an initial dilute Mantoux test (1 in 10 000) may be
performed in individuals who have not received BCG immunisation.
■ Urinalysis
May reveal the presence of protein and red cell casts with

[START_SECTION]glomerulonephritis due to Goodpasture’s syndrome and Wegener’s
granulomatosis.
■ Antiglomerular basement antibodies
Characterises Goodpasture’s syndrome.
■ c-ANCA
Wegener’s granulomatosis is associated with elevated levels.
■ Renal biopsy
Will aid in confirming the diagnosis in both Goodpasture’s syndrome
and Wegener’s granulomatosis.
■ Tissue biopsies
Majority of lung cancers are diagnosed on CXR; a smaller proportion are
diagnosed by cytology. Definitive tissue diagnosis can be made by
biopsies from bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, CT-guided biopsy or
surgical resection.
■ CT thorax/pulmonary angiogram
Very useful adjunct to the diagnosis of bronchiectasis in cases where the
diagnosis cannot confidently be made on the clinical grounds and a
chest film. It may also be useful in the staging of lung carcinomas. The
CT pulmonary angiogram is currently the investigation of choice to
screen for pulmonary embolism.
■ Echocardiography
Allows assessment of left ventricular function with pulmonary oedema.
It may also aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, as right heart
failure can occur with large emboli. The integrity of the cardiac valves
can be assessed, and valve stenosis with restriction of movement of the
mitral valve leaflets can be visualised in mitral stenosis.
• Haemoptysis in a smoker is an indication for a CXR,
especially if associated with other features, e.g. dyspnoea,
clubbing.
• Always consider TB, especially in the elderly, immigrants
and the immunocompromised (from whatever cause).
• With massive haemoptysis, the main priorities are to secure
the airway and initiate emergency resuscitative measures

[START_SECTION]before establishing a diagnosis.

[START_SECTION]Halitosis
Halitosis is a frequent or persistent unpleasant odour to the breath. It is
usually due to poor dental hygiene. It may have a significant impact,
both personally and socially, on those who suffer from it. Rarely, it may
be the symptom of a serious underlying condition.

Causes
• Poor oral hygiene
• Smoking
• Diet, e.g. onions, garlic, spices
• Gingivitis
• Excess alcohol intake
• Dental abscess
• Dry mouth, e.g. starvation, salivary gland disease
• Acute and chronic sinusitis
• Acute tonsillitis
• Nasal foreign body
• GORD
• Abdominal sepsis, e.g. foetor of acute appendicitis
• Drugs, e.g. disulfiram
• Psychogenic halitosis
• Pharyngeal pouch
• Bronchiectasis
• Liver failure
• Renal failure (uraemia)
• Necrotic oral/nasopharyngeal cancer

[START_SECTION]History
History of toothache, poor diet, smoking, alcohol. Painful gums,
bleeding from gums. Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (Vincent’s
angina) is rare but presents with swollen gums with small ulcers, which
may spread to the buccal mucosa and the patient will complain of
bleeding from the gums, together with a constitutional upset with fever
and malaise. Heartburn (GORD), dysphagia (pharyngeal pouch):
dysphagia may occur due to a pharyngeal pouch pressing on the
oesophagus. It may gurgle on palpation and regurgitation of food may
occur on lying down, with subsequent development of aspiration
pneumonia. Sinusitis may present with a nasal discharge and facial pain
over the sinus. Cough, sputum and recurrent chest infections may
indicate bronchiectasis. Dry mouth may be a part of prolonged
starvation with chronic or acute illness or disease of the salivary glands,
e.g. Sjögren’s syndrome. There may be a history of diabetes, renal failure
or liver failure. Is the halitosis worse in the morning and gets better
during the day? Is the patient otherwise well?

Examination
A worse odour through the mouth suggests an oral aetiology. A worse
odour through the nose suggests either sinusitis or a foreign body. Nasal
odours are usually more pungent than oral odours. The tongue may be
coated, especially the posterior one-third. Check for gingivitis,
periodontal disease and dental abscess. Gingivitis presents with red
swollen and bleeding gums. In acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis, in
addition to the swollen, bleeding gums, there may be yellowish ulcers,
which may also be seen on the buccal mucosa and occasionally on the
tonsils. There is usually tender lymphadenopathy. Examine the salivary
glands. Carry out a full examination of the oral cavity. Ulcers with hard
everted edges, which bleed on contact are likely to be neoplastic. Look
for signs of liver failure.

• Most (85%) cases of halitosis are due to poor oral hygiene.
• In the absence of an obvious cause, always fully examine the

[START_SECTION]head and neck, including the oral cavity and nasal airway.
Check for lymphadenopathy.
• Remember alcohol abuse. Check for signs of liver failure.
• In the patient who complains of halitosis, in the absence of
obvious bad breath, consider psychogenic halitosis, especially
if there is a history of depression.

[START_SECTION]Hallucinations
An hallucination is an apparent sensory perception of an external object
when no such object is present. It is to be differentiated from an illusion,
which is a real perception that is misinterpreted.

Causes
• Fever (especially children and the elderly)
• Drugs (and drug withdrawal)
■ Marijuana
■ Cocaine
■ LSD
■ Ecstasy
■ Solvent sniffing
■ Amphetamines
■ Tricyclic antidepressant overdose
• Alcohol
• Alcoholic hallucinations
• Delirium tremens (alcohol withdrawal)
• Extreme fatigue
• Psychiatric disorders
• Schizophrenia
• Psychotic depression
• Post-traumatic stress disorder
• Mania
• Sensory deprivation (e.g. blindness or deafness)
• Hypoxia
• Severe metabolic disturbances (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis,

[START_SECTION]hypothyroidism)
• Severe medical illness
• Liver failure
• Renal failure
• Neurological disease
• Temporal lobe epilepsy
• Cerebral tumour
• Post-concussional state
• Dementia
• Narcolepsy
• Others
• Bereavement reaction

History
Obtain a clear history of the hallucination. Common hallucinations
include hearing voices when no-one has spoken; seeing patterns, lights,
beings or objects that are not there; feeling a crawling sensation on the
skin. Hallucinations related to smell or taste are rare. Pure olfactory
hallucinations are strongly suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy.
Enquire about recreational drugs. Auditory hallucinations are more
common in psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia. Acute onset of
febrile illnesses may be associated with hallucinations, especially in
children and the elderly. Enquire about alcohol abuse or alcohol
withdrawal. Hallucinations may be ‘normal’, e.g. hearing the voice of a
loved one who has recently died, being part of a bereavement reaction.

Examination
Check the patient’s temperature. Look for signs of infection. Look for
signs of liver failure and kidney failure. Carry out a full neurological
examination to exclude the possibility of a cerebral space-occupying
lesion. A full mental state examination should be undertaken for

[START_SECTION]possible psychiatric disorder.

General Investigations
■ Urinalysis
UTI, hyperglycaemic ketoacidosis.
■ FBC
WCC ↑ infection. MCV ↑ alcohol excess.
■ U&Es
Metabolic disturbances. Renal failure.
■ LFTs
Liver failure.
■ Blood sugar
Hyperglycaemic ketoacidosis.

Specific Investigations
■ ABGs

■ EEG
Temporal lobe epilepsy.
■ CT scan
Cerebral space-occupying lesion. Dementia.
• Hallucinations in children with febrile illness are common.
• Pure olfactory hallucinations are strongly suggestive of
temporal lobe epilepsy.
• Tactile hallucinations strongly suggest acute alcohol
withdrawal.

[START_SECTION]Hand Deformities
Impairment of hand function can lead to severe disability.

Causes
Congenital
Failure of Formation
• Absent digit
• Radial club hand

Failure of Separation
• Syndactyly (fusion of digits)
• Camptodactyly

Duplication
• Extra digit

Primary Muscle Contractures
• Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita

Acquired
• Dupuytren’s contracture
• Rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 32)
• Trauma (mal-united fracture)
• Burns
• Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture
• Brachial plexus lesions
• Peripheral nerve lesions

[START_SECTION]• Spinal cord lesions
• Poliomyelitis
• Syringomyelia
• Multiple chondromas (Ollier’s disease)

FIGURE 32 Rheumatoid hand.
Early changes include synovitis of the wrist, metacarpophalangeal joints
and proximal interphalangeal joints. In severe advanced changes, there is
massive tendon swelling over the dorsal surfaces of the wrists, severe
muscle wasting, ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints and
swan-neck deformity of the fingers.

History
Congenital
These lesions will be recognisable at birth. Arthrogryposis multiplex
congenita is due to non-differentiation of mesenchymal tissues, often
together with a neurogenic element, the combination producing gross
contractures.

Acquired

[START_SECTION]Trauma and burns
There will be a clear history of previous trauma and burns.

Dupuytren’s contracture
In the early phases, there will be little deformity, the patient merely
complaining of thickening in the palm near the base of the ring finger.
Eventually, the patient will complain of being unable to straighten the
ring and little fingers. The grip is also affected. Check for a history of
epilepsy, cirrhosis or diabetes.

Rheumatoid arthritis
By the time the hand is deformed, the patient is usually well aware of the
diagnosis. There is pain and swelling of the joints with weakness of the
hand, together with gross deformity.

Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture
This is shortening of the long flexor muscles of the forearm due to
ischaemia. There may be a history of trauma, e.g. supracondylar fracture
of the humerus, a tight plaster restricting blood flow, or arterial disease,
e.g. embolism. Movements of the fingers are painful and limited. There
may be ‘pins and needles’ in the hand due to pressure on nerves.
Eventually a claw hand results.

Spinal cord lesions
By the time deformity of the limb has resulted, the diagnosis will usually
be apparent. There may be a history of poliomyelitis.

Brachial plexus lesions
There will usually be a history of trauma, although occasionally,
invasion of the brachial plexus from tumours may occur.

Peripheral nerve lesions

[START_SECTION]There is usually a clear history of trauma to suggest a nerve lesion.
Check for any possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, e.g. diabetes,
uraemia, connective tissue disease, leprosy.

Ollier’s disease
This results in deformities of the limb. There are irregularly distributed
areas of cartilage and bone. The patient will complain of deformity of
joints and bones and possible shortening of the limb, and will have
noticed nodules along the line of bone.

Examination
Congenital
Congenital anomalies will be obvious at birth. They may be associated
with congenital anomalies elsewhere.

Acquired
Trauma and burns
A variety of deformities may be seen, depending upon the degree and
type of trauma. With burns, scarring of the skin will be obvious.

Dupuytren’s contracture
Examination will reveal a firm nodule in the palmar fascia near the base
of the ring finger. Puckering of the skin is usually present around the
nodule. The MCP joint and the PIP joint are flexed, the DIP joint being
extended. The ulnar digits (ring and little finger) are most commonly
affected.

Rheumatoid arthritis
There is thickening of the joints, especially the MCP joint and PIP joints.
The joints become fusiform in shape. There is ulnar deviation of the
fingers. The wrist joint develops a fixed flexion deformity with some

[START_SECTION]ulnar deviation. Swan-neck and boutonnière deformities of the fingers
will be apparent. Ultimately, tendon rupture occurs and this leads to a
variety of deformities.

Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture
The skin of the hand is pale and the hand clawed and wasted. Extension
of the fingers is limited but improves if the wrist is flexed. Eventually,
the forearm muscles feel hard and taut due to fibrosis.

Spinal cord lesions
In the case of poliomyelitis, there is usually a clear history and the limb
usually looks reddish-blue, wasted and deformed. Syringomyelia may
cause a variety of hand deformities. With upper motor neurone lesions,
there may be fixed flexion of the wrist and fingers with adduction of the
thumb.

Brachial plexus injuries
Upward traction on the arm may damage the lowest root (T1) of the
brachial plexus, which is the segmental supply of the intrinsic muscles
of the hand. The hand becomes clawed (Klumpke’s paralysis). Check for
a possible associated Horner’s syndrome due to traction of the cervical
sympathetic chain.

Peripheral nerve lesions
With ulnar nerve lesions, it is appropriate to check for damage to the
medial epicondyle. Also check for any evidence of recent lacerations at
the wrist. With division at the wrist, all the intrinsic muscles of the
fingers (except for the radial two lumbricals – median nerve) are
paralysed and the hand appears clawed. The clawing is less for the index
and middle fingers because the lumbricals are intact. In late cases,
wasting of the interossei is clearly seen on the dorsum of the hand. There
is sensory loss over the medial 1{1/2} fingers. If the nerve is injured at the
elbow, the flexor digitorum profundus to the ring and little fingers is

[START_SECTION]paralysed so that the clawing of these two digits is not so pronounced.
In median nerve lesions at the wrist, the thenar eminence becomes
wasted due to paralysis of opponens pollicis and sensation is lost over
the lateral 3{1/2} digits. Fine movements, e.g. picking up a small object,
are clumsy. With lesions at the elbow, wrist flexion is weak and the
forearm muscles wasted. Ulnar deviation occurs at the wrist, as the
wrist flexion depends upon flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of
flexor digitorum profundus. Often the hand is held with the medial two
fingers flexed and the lateral two fingers straight.

Ollier’s disease
Multiple lumps (chondromas) are located on the bones. Often associated
with limb shortening. Only one limb or one bone may be involved.

General Investigations
Most of the conditions described above will be obvious on clinical
examination.
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ in anaemia of chronic disease, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis.
■ CRP
↑ in inflammatory disease
■ Rheumatoid factor
Rheumatoid arthritis.
■ LFTs
Cirrhosis (Dupuytren’s contracture).
■ Blood glucose
Diabetes. Peripheral neuropathy, Dupuytren’s contracture.
■ Arm X-ray
Local fractures, e.g. evidence of previous supracondylar fracture of the
humerus with subsequent Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture.
■ Hand X-ray
Rheumatoid arthritis. Ollier’s disease – multiple translucent areas in the
bones of the hand. Evidence of mal-united fracture following trauma.

[START_SECTION]■ MRI
Spinal lesions, e.g. syringomyelia.
■ Nerve conduction studies
Brachial plexus and peripheral nerve lesions.
• The hand is a sophisticated mechanism from both motor
and sensory considerations. Every attempt should be made to
prevent hand deformities occurring as a result of trauma and
infection. All hand injuries and infections should be referred
to a specialist hand surgeon, as expert care is necessary from
the outset to preserve or restore function.

[START_SECTION]Headache
When assessing a patient with headache, it is important to exclude lifethreatening causes first.

Causes
Acute Headache
• Trauma
• Cerebrovascular
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage (Fig. 33)
• Intracranial haemorrhage/infarction
• Systemic infection
• Meningitis
• Acute angle-closure glaucoma

FIGURE 33 CT scan of a subarachnoid haemorrhage due to rupture of

[START_SECTION]an anterior communicating aneurysm.
Blood (arrows) is seen in the subarachnoid space.

Chronic or Recurrent Headache
• Tension headache
• Migraine
• Cluster headaches
• Drugs, e.g. glyceryl trinitrate, nifedipine, substance
withdrawal (especially alcohol)
• Cervical spondylosis
• Psychological (including anxiety and depression)
• Raised intracranial pressure
• Tumour
• Hydrocephalus
• Cerebral abscess
• Benign intracranial hypertension
• Temporal arteritis
• Pre-eclampsia
• Paget’s disease of bone
• Severe hypertension
• Carbon monoxide poisoning

History
Onset
Sudden onset of severe pain is usually due to a vascular cause, especially
subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured berry aneurysm. Cluster
headache and migraine intensify over minutes and may last several
hours, while meningitis tends to evolve over hours to days. Progressive
severe headaches that develop over days or weeks should lead to the
consideration of raised intracranial pressure from tumour or chronic
subdural haemorrhage. The onset of headache may be preceded by an

[START_SECTION]aura with migraine.

Site
Classically, headache from migraine is unilateral. Temporal arteritis
leads to more localised pain over the superficial temporal arteries that
can be accompanied by jaw claudication. Ocular pain is experienced
with glaucoma, and retro-orbital pain with cluster headaches.

Character
The intensity of pain contributes little when discriminating between the
causes; however, the character of the pain may be useful. Patients with
tension headache often complain of a tight band-like sensation; this is in
contrast to the pain experienced with raised intracranial pressure, which
is often reported to have a bursting quality. Migraine-related and
temporal arteritis headaches have a throbbing character.

Precipitating factors
Headache originating from raised intracranial pressure is precipitated
by changes in posture, coughing or sneezing, and is often worse in the
mornings. Photophobia may be experienced by patients suffering with
migraine, meningitis or glaucoma. They may prefer to lie in a darkened
room when headaches arise. Certain foods such as cheese, red wine and
chocolate are known to precipitate migraine. It is very common for
headache to be precipitated by systemic illnesses such as a cold or
influenza. Headache precipitated by touch occurs with superficial
temporal artery inflammation from temporal arteritis. A drug history
may elucidate the relationship between the administration of drugs with
headache as a side-effect, such as glyceryl trinitrate and nifedipine.
Alternatively, headache can also result from substance withdrawal in
substance-dependent patients.

Associated symptoms

[START_SECTION]Associated symptoms
Neck stiffness (meningism) is experienced with both meningitis and
subarachnoid haemorrhages. Visual disturbances in the form of haloes
occur with glaucoma. Flashing lights and alternations in perception of
size may be reported by patients suffering with migraine, and this may
be accompanied by photophobia, nausea and vomiting. Transient
neurological deficits may also occur. However, progressive neurology
associated with headache is more suggestive of an intracranial spaceoccupying lesion, such as haemorrhage, abscess and tumour. Unilateral
visual loss may result as a complication of temporal arteritis, and this
may be accompanied by proximal muscle pain, stiffness and weakness
or tenderness. Conjunctival infection is experienced with both glaucoma
and cluster headaches, along with lacrimation, which is a feature of the
latter. With normal pressure hydrocephalus in adults, headaches are
associated with dementia, drowsiness, vomiting and ataxia.

Examination
Temperature
Pyrexia may indicate the presence of systemic infection, meningitis or
vasculitis.

Inspection
An assessment of the conscious state should be undertaken and
quantified on the GCS. Impairment of consciousness is a sign of a
serious underlying aetiology, such as meningitis, subarachnoid
haemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure. Inspection of the eyes
may reveal conjunctival infection with glaucoma and cluster headaches
during an acute attack. With acute angle-closure glaucoma, the cornea is
hazy and the pupil fixed and semi-dilated. Petechial haemorrhages
classically occur with meningococcal meningitis.

Palpation

[START_SECTION]Tenderness along the course of the superficial temporal artery, with
absent pulsation, is consistent with temporal arteritis.

Neurological examination
A detailed neurological examination is performed to identify the site of
any structural lesion. Unilateral total visual loss can be precipitated by
temporal arteritis due to ischaemic optic neuritis. Visual field defects
(hemianopia) can be caused by contralateral lesions in the cerebral
cortex. Fundoscopy is performed to identify papilloedema from raised
intracranial pressure.
Transient hemiplegia can occur with migraine, but progressive
hemiplegia is more indicative of a space-occupying lesion, such as a
tumour or intracranial haemorrhage. Neck stiffness is a feature of both
meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage. With meningitis, Kernig’s
sign (pain on extending the knee with the hip in a flexed position) may
be present.

General Investigations
■ FBC
WCC ↑ meningitis, cerebral abscess and systemic infection.
■ ESR and CRP
↑ temporal arteritis, infection, intracranial bleeding.
■ U&Es
Hypertensive headaches with renal disease.
■ Alkaline phosphatase
Elevated in Paget’s disease.
■ Radiology
Cervical spine X-rays identify cervical spondylosis and cranial X-rays
may reveal Paget’s disease.

Specific Investigations
In most cases, the diagnosis can be made on clinical assessment.

[START_SECTION]Features in the history and examination may guide specific
investigations.
■ Blood cultures
With meningitis, systemic infection.
■ CT/MRI
Visualisation of the anatomical structures in the cranium is very useful
in the presence of neurological deficit. Cerebral tumours may be
visualised as high or low-density masses. Intracranial bleeding can be
identified as areas of high density during the first two weeks. An
extradural haematoma presents as a lens-shaped opacity, and subdural
haematoma presents as a crescent-shaped opacity. After two weeks,
intracranial haematomas become isodense and more difficult to
visualise. Following subarachnoid haemorrhage, blood may be
visualised in the subarachnoid space. Occasionally the offending
aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation may be imaged. Enlargement
of the ventricles may be an indication of hydrocephalus. Contrastenhanced CT or MRI will increase the sensitivity to diagnose cerebral
abscesses.
■ Lumbar puncture
A lumbar puncture may be undertaken following the exclusion of raised
intracranial pressure, when there is suspicion of meningitis or
subarachnoid haemorrhage. The opening pressure is recorded and the
CSF obtained is inspected for consistency and colour. The consistency of
the CSF is turbid with meningitis, and yellow staining of the CSF
(known as xanthochromia) occurs with subarachnoid haemorrhage,
owing to breakdown of haemoglobin from red blood cells. The CSF is
then sent for microscopy, culture, cytology and biochemical analysis for
glucose and protein. An abnormal increase in white cells may be seen
on microscopy with meningitis. With bacterial or tuberculous
meningitis, the glucose is low and protein content high. With viral
meningitis the glucose content is normal and protein content mildly
elevated. A lumbar puncture may also be helpful in cases of benign
intracranial hypertension.
■ Temporal artery biopsy

[START_SECTION]Inflammation and giant cells may be seen with temporal arteritis. A
normal biopsy does not, however, exclude the disease, as there may be
segmental involvement of the temporal artery.
■ Intraocular pressure measurements
Tonometry will reveal high intraocular pressures with glaucoma.
• Although extremely common, headache should always be
investigated if there is any concern regarding sinister
pathology, such as CVA or malignancy.
• Temporal arteritis must be treated immediately with highdose corticosteroids to avoid complete and irreversible
blindness.

[START_SECTION]Hemiplegia
Hemiplegia is paralysis of one side of the body; it usually arises from
unilateral lesions above the midcervical spinal cord.

Causes
Vascular
• Cerebrovascular ischaemia
• Cerebral or spinal infarction
• Intracerebral haemorrhage
• Paradoxical embolus
• Cerebral vasculitis

Traumatic
• Subdural haematoma
• Extradural haematoma

Other
• Epilepsy (Todd’s paralysis)
• Multiple sclerosis
• Brain tumour
• Cerebral abscess

History

[START_SECTION]Onset
The speed of onset of hemiplegia is useful when trying to determine the
underlying aetiology. Sudden onset hemiplegia is usually due to a
cerebrovascular event such as a TIA, infarct or intracerebral
haemorrhage. Hemiplegia developing over minutes or hours after
trauma can be due to an evolving extradural or subdural haemorrhage.
Although a history of trauma is usually evident, chronic subdural
haematomas in the elderly may result from tearing of bridging veins
without apparent trauma. Subacute hemiplegia may also result as part
of a spectrum of neurological deficits caused by demyelination from
multiple sclerosis. Gradual onset of hemiplegia is usually due to a
tumour, although a cerebral abscess or chronic subdural haemorrhage
may pursue a similar time course.

Precipitating factors
A history of trauma may be evident with extradural and subdural
haemorrhages. Cerebral abscesses may result from haematogenous
dissemination of bacteria from a distant site of infection, such as the
lung, or more commonly from adjacent infections, such as middle ear,
mastoid and paranasal sinus infections. Transient hemiplegia may also
result from an epileptic seizure and this phenomenon is known as
Todd’s paralysis. Unfortunately, the precipitating factor for the seizure
may be underlying structural abnormalities such as a cerebral abscess
or tumour.

Associated symptoms
Owing to the multifocal nature of demyelination, patients with multiple
sclerosis may present with a host of associated symptoms, such as areas
of motor deficits, sensory deficits, diplopia and monocular blindness
from optic neuritis. Space-occupying lesions such as extradural
haematoma, brain tumour and cerebral abscesses may also present with
symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, such as headaches, classically

[START_SECTION]worse in the morning, and with coughing or sneezing, nausea, vomiting
and drowsiness.

Examination
The neurological examination is the key to determining the location of
the lesion. Cortical lesions impinging on the motor area of the frontal
lobe produce total contralateral paralysis. Similar effects can result from
lesions of the internal capsule. Midbrain lesions tend to produce
ipsilateral neurological deficits of the face and contralateral deficits of
the limbs. Multifocal neurological deficits may be produced by
demyelination or cerebral metastasis.
After determining the site of the lesion, the examination should be
continued to determine the cause. Pyrexia should alert the clinician to
the presence of infection, which may be caused by a cerebral abscess.
The presence of facial myokymia, which is rippling of the muscles on
one side of the face, is reported to be very suggestive of multiple
sclerosis; cervical involvement may produce Lhermitte’s sign, which is
paraesthesia of the hands and feet on flexion of the neck.
Examination of the ear, mastoid and sinuses is useful to locate the site
of primary infection, which may give rise to a cerebral abscess. Distant
sites of infection that may precipitate cerebral abscesses are the lungs
and emboli from infective endocarditis. The fingers are examined for
nailfold infarcts with endocarditis and the precordium is auscultated for
new or changing murmurs. The pulse is assessed for irregularity from
atrial fibrillation, which is a predisposing factor for cerebral emboli.
The blood pressure is measured, as hypertension is an additional risk
factor for stroke. Carotid bruits from atherosclerotic plaques may be the
only examination feature present with TIAs. Leg examination may
reveal a deep vein thrombosis with possible paradoxical embolus.

General Investigations
■ FBC
WCC ↑ infection, infarction.

[START_SECTION]■ ESR
↑ infection, infarction, vasculitis.
■ U&Es, magnesium, calcium and glucose
Abnormal electrolytes and glucose level may precipitate a seizure.

Specific Investigations
■ Blood cultures
For suspected cerebral abscess.
■ CT head
Intracerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction, head injuries, tumour
and abscess.
■ MRI head and cervical spine
Abscess, tumours, focal demyelination and periventricular plaques with
multiple sclerosis.
■ EEG
Epilepsy.
■ Lumbar puncture
Exclude raised intracranial pressure first. With multiple sclerosis, there
is raised CSF IgG and oligoclonal bands are present on electrophoresis.
■ Ultrasound and Echocardiogram
Leg deep vein thrombosis and cardiac septal defect with paradoxical
embolus.
• Sudden onset hemiplegia is an emergency and requires
immediate investigation. A CT scan should be performed
expeditiously to identify cerebral bleeds or infarction.

[START_SECTION]Hepatomegaly
Hepatomegaly is enlargement of the liver. The most common causes in
the UK are cirrhosis, cardiac failure and secondary malignancy.

Causes
Hepatitis/Infection
Acute
• Alcohol
• Viruses
• Bacteria
• Protozoans
• Parasites

Chronic
• Chronic active hepatitis

Congestion
• Congestive cardiac failure

[START_SECTION]History
Hepatitis/infection
Predisposing factors include a history of contact with hepatitis, blood
transfusion, drug abuse, homosexuals, haemophiliacs, health workers,
the institutionalised (e.g. homes, prison) and travel abroad to endemic
areas. Amoebiasis occurs worldwide, and hepatitis B is prevalent in the
tropics and Mediterranean areas. Hydatid disease is more common in
sheep-rearing countries, e.g. Australia, Africa, Wales. Leptospirosis can
result from swimming in rat-infested waters. History of alcohol abuse
predisposes to alcoholic cirrhosis. Chronic active hepatitis should be
considered with a history of alcohol, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. In the
majority of hepatitis/infection cases, the patient presents with general
malaise, pyrexia, weight loss and jaundice.

Congestion
History of congestive cardiac failure may be evident and the patient
often complains of upper abdominal pain caused by a tender liver due to
stretching of the liver capsule. With constrictive pericarditis, there is
often a history of TB but it may follow any cause of pericarditis, e.g.
acute renal failure. Budd–Chiari syndrome is hepatic vein thrombosis. A
history of taking the contraceptive pill may be contributory. Tumour
may also cause Budd–Chiari syndrome. It presents insidiously with
portal hypertension, jaundice and cirrhosis.

Infiltration
There is usually a history of alcohol abuse with fatty infiltration.
Secondary amyloidosis follows chronic infection/inflammation, e.g.
rheumatoid arthritis, bronchiectasis, inflammatory bowel disease.

Biliary tract disease

[START_SECTION]There may be a history of biliary tract obstruction, e.g. carcinoma of the
pancreas or stricture of the common bile duct. Sclerosing cholangitis
causes jaundice and fevers and is associated with inflammatory bowel
disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis is of unknown aetiology. Some 90% of
the patients are female. It presents with obstructive jaundice, pruritus
and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient will complain of dark urine and
pale stools.

Malignancy
The chief cause is metastases from a known malignancy, which may
have been treated, e.g. gastrointestinal tract or bronchus. Hepatoma is
rare. With hepatoma, there may be a past history of hepatitis B infection,
use of the contraceptive pill, aflatoxin exposure, or use of anabolic
steroids. Myeloproliferative disease presents with tiredness, lethargy
and spontaneous bruising.

Metabolic
Glycogen storage disease is rare. There is usually hepatomegaly from
birth. The early features of haemochromatosis include fatigue,
arthralgia and hepatomegaly. Skin pigmentation, diabetes and cardiac
failure occur later.

Others
Cryptogenic cirrhosis presents with hepatomegaly without an obvious
cause. Riedel’s lobe is usually an incidental finding and asymptomatic.
Riedel’s lobe is an extension of the right lobe of the liver below the
costal margin. It is a normal anatomical variation.

Examination
Remember that a liver edge that is palpable is not always enlarged and
may have been pushed down by pulmonary hyperinflation, e.g.

[START_SECTION]emphysema. The upper border of the liver should therefore be identified
by percussion and is usually at the level of the eighth rib in the
midaxillary line. The edge of the liver can be sharp or rounded and its
surface smooth or nodular.

[START_SECTION]General
Carry out a general examination of the patient. Look for signs of liver
failure: jaundice, flapping tremor, ascites, spider naevi, liver palms,
clubbing, gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy, caput medusae, peripheral
oedema, leuconychia, Dupuytren’s contracture, xanthoma, mental
changes, coma, bruising. Look for Kayser–Fleischer rings (Wilson’s
disease).

Congestion
Signs of CCF. Peripheral oedema. Tense tender liver. JVP ↑. With Budd–
Chiari syndrome, there will be acute ascites and right upper quadrant
pain. In constrictive pericarditis, there will be right heart failure
associated with ascites. The JVP rises paradoxically with inspiration.
Pulsus paradoxus. Hypotension.

Biliary tract disease
Deep jaundice. There may be a palpable mass associated with the
primary malignancy. The gall bladder may be palpable with carcinoma
of the head of the pancreas (Courvoisier’s law). With primary biliary
cirrhosis, there will be clubbing, xanthomata, arthralgia, hirsutism,
portal hypertension and skin pigmentation.

Storage disease
With haemochromatosis, there will be signs of portal hypertension and
skin pigmentation.

Malignancy
Jaundice and ascites may be present. There may be an abdominal mass
representing the primary malignancy. With myeloproliferative
disorders, in addition to hepatomegaly, there will be splenomegaly and
lymphadenopathy.

General Investigations

[START_SECTION]General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ malignancy, myeloproliferative disorders. WCC ↑ infection,
leukaemia. Platelets ↓ leukaemia. ESR ↑ infection and malignancy.
■ U&Es
Creatinine. Often deranged in liver failure. Renal failure may occur with
amyloidosis.
■ LFTs
Liver enzymes deranged in hepatitis. Alkaline phosphatase grossly
raised in obstruction. The pattern varies according to the cause of
hepatomegaly.
■ Clotting screen
PT ↑ absence of clotting factors.
■ Hepatitis serology
Raised according to cause.

Specific Investigations
■ Serum iron, TIBC and serum ferritin
Abnormal in haemochromatosis.
■ Blood, urine, CSF culture
Positive in leptospirosis.
■ Antibody screen
Antimicrosomal antibodies raised in primary biliary cirrhosis.
■ Bone marrow aspiration
Myelofibrosis. Leukaemia.
■ US
Cirrhosis. Secondaries. Amoebic abscess. Hydatid cyst. Riedel’s lobe.
■ CT
Pancreatic lesions. Cirrhosis. Liver cysts.
■ MRCP
Ductal abnormalities, e.g. stricture, stone.
■ Liver biopsy
Establish cause, e.g. malignancy, amyloid.

[START_SECTION]• The liver edge is normally palpable during infancy until
about the end of the 3rd year. It is also palpable in thin adults.
• A normal liver can appear enlarged if displaced downwards
by lung disease, e.g. COPD.
• Remember Riedel’s lobe. It can be mistaken for pathological
enlargement of the liver. It is a normal anatomical variation.
Its presence should be confirmed by ultrasound scan.

[START_SECTION]Hiccups
Hiccups (hiccoughs) are the characteristic sounds produced by the
involuntary contractions of the diaphragm terminated by sudden closure
of the glottis. In the majority, it is a self-limiting condition. The most
common cause of hiccups is thought to be gastric distension after rapid
ingestion of food, fluid or air. The causes of intractable hiccups are listed
below.

Causes
Phrenic Nerve Irritation
• Oesophageal carcinoma
• Lung tumour
• Thoracic surgery

Diaphragmatic Irritation
• Lower lobe pneumonia
• Empyema
• Subphrenic abscess
• Diaphragmatic hernia
• Gastric distension

Cns Conditions
• Meningitis
• Tumours
• Intracranial haemorrhage
• Brainstem stroke

[START_SECTION]• Encephalitis

Others
• Uraemic
• Hysterical
• Toxic

History
The causes of hiccups predominantly originate in the respiratory,
abdominal and nervous systems, therefore the history is structured
similarly.

Respiratory history
The presence of cough with purulent sputum production implies
respiratory tract infection. However, patients with pneumonia tend to be
more unwell and may complain of rigors with high temperatures.
Following pneumonia or thoracic surgery, chronic pyrexia and pleuritic
chest pains with failure of resolution of symptoms of the original
infection may herald the onset of an empyema. Hiccups may (rarely)
complicate routine thoracic surgery. When a chronic cough is associated
with haemoptysis and weight loss in a smoker, bronchial tumour is the
most likely diagnosis.

Abdominal history
Symptoms of rapid progressive painless dysphagia (p. 109) may be due
to oesophageal carcinoma. At birth, a diaphragmatic hernia may present
with respiratory distress; adults with diaphragmatic hernias may,
however, be completely asymptomatic, the hernia being detected
incidentally on a chest X-ray. Unremitting pyrexia and malaise in
patients after abdominal surgery, or following localised inflammatory

[START_SECTION]conditions such as appendicitis and cholecystitis, may have developed
an intra-abdominal abscess. The subphrenic region is the most common
site of a collection of pus. This is associated with intractable hiccups and
pain referred to the shoulder, scapula or neck. A pleural effusion may be
an accompanying feature.

Neurological history
Pyrexia, headache, photophobia and neck stiffness are associated with
meningitis. Patients with encephalitis tend to present with confusion,
alterations in consciousness and seizures. The brainstem is a very
anatomically complex structure, therefore symptoms of infarction or
tumour may be very variable, depending on distribution of involvement
of the lower cranial nerves. The presenting features may be diplopia,
difficulty swallowing, dysarthria and facial sensory loss. Cortical
lesions arising from infarction or haemorrhage may present with
aphasia, visual field defects and hemiplegia. The principal
differentiating feature between infarction and tumour is the speed of
onset; in general, stroke presents suddenly and tumours progressively.

Others
Amelioration of hiccups by sleep, bizarre accompanying symptoms and
inconsistencies in the history are suggestive of hysterical hiccups.
Uraemia may be responsible for hiccups.

Examination
A substantial number of causes of intractable hiccups are associated
with pyrexia. High swinging fevers are suggestive of collections of pus,
such as empyema and subphrenic abscesses.
An abdominal examination should be performed. Areas of tenderness
may suggest appendicitis or cholecystitis as a predisposing cause for a
subphrenic abscess. More specifically, an abdominal abscess may point
to the skin surface, or present with tenderness over the lower chest wall.

[START_SECTION]Respiratory examination may reveal tracheal deviation with a large
empyema or pleural effusion from carcinoma. Areas of percussion
dullness correspond to consolidation, effusion and empyema. A large
diaphragmatic hernia may elevate the diaphragm sufficiently to produce
clinical signs suggestive of an effusion. Localised coarse crepitations
may be auscultated, corresponding to areas of consolidation by
pneumonia. Vocal resonance is increased with consolidation but
attenuated with effusion and empyema.
A neurological examination is performed to identify the presence of
and define the anatomical territory of any deficit. Specialised tests
should be performed for meningitis. This will include Kernig’s sign
(pain on extension of the knee from a flexed hip and knee position) and
Brudzinski’s sign (flexion of the neck produces flexion of the hip and
knee).

General Investigations
In the absence of features in the history to guide specific investigations,
the following general investigations should be performed.
■ FBC
WCC ↑ with infection, malignancy.
■ ESR
↑ infection, malignancy.
■ U&Es
↑ urea, ↑ creatinine with renal failure.
■ CXR
Peripheral shadow or cavitation, hilar mass, collapse of a lobe may
suggest carcinoma. Consolidation is seen with pneumonia. Fluid with a
meniscus may be due to empyema, effusion from malignancy or as a
result of a subphrenic abscess. Elevation of a hemidiaphragm may be
due to phrenic nerve palsy from carcinomatous infiltration or apparent
elevation due to the presence of a diaphragmatic hernia.

Specific Investigations

[START_SECTION]■ Upper GI endoscopy and biopsy
Oesophageal carcinoma.
■ Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy
Biopsy for bronchial carcinoma.
■ CT thorax
Biopsy for bronchial carcinoma, definition and identification of
loculations with empyema.
■ US abdomen
Subphrenic abscess; aspiration and drainage may also be performed.
■ CT/MRI head
Infarction and tumour may be appreciated as low-density areas. Mass
effects may be produced by tumour or bleeding causing midline shifts.
Intracranial bleeding may be identified as a high-density area. Cortical
swelling may be seen with encephalitis. Raised intracranial pressure can
be identified and is a contraindication to lumbar puncture.
■ EEG
Encephalitis – periodic complex formation and slowing of the
background rhythm.
■ Lumbar puncture
Meningitis. Encephalitis – high lymphocyte count as the majority are
due to viral aetiology.
• If hiccups are persistent, chronic, interfere with work, eating
or sleep, or are associated with weight loss, a full
investigation is required to exclude a serious underlying
disorder.

[START_SECTION]Hirsutism
Hirsutism is the presence of male-pattern hair growth in women. This is
not synonymous with virilism, which, in addition to hirsutism, is
associated with the development of male secondary sexual
characteristics in women. Hypertrichosis refers to the excessive growth
of hair and may occur in either sex.

Causes
Physiological
• Senility
• Familial (varies with ethnicity)

Pathological
Drugs
• Ciclosporin
• Antiepileptic drugs, e.g. phenytoin
• Corticosteroids
• Progestogens
• Testosterone (including anabolic steroids)
• Minoxidil

Pituitary
• Prolactinoma
• Cushing’s disease
• Acromegaly

Ovarian

[START_SECTION]• Polycystic ovarian syndrome
• Menopause
• Androgen-producing ovarian tumour

Adrenal
• Cushing’s syndrome
• Androgen-producing adrenal tumours
• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

Other
• Anorexia nervosa

History
General
The onset and duration of hirsutism are useful features in the history to
help determine the aetiology. Onset in childhood is suggestive of
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, whereas sudden onset of hirsutism in
adult females raises concerns of androgen-producing tumours of the
ovaries or adrenal glands. Enquiries should be undertaken as to whether
any relatives have similar problems as the aetiology may be familial.
However, beware of family cancer syndromes, such as BRCA gene
mutation, which is associated with familial ovarian carcinoma.
Excessive androgens may result in virilisation, producing symptoms
such as acne and deepening of the voice.

Menstrual history
A detailed history regarding the onset, periodicity and regularity of the
menstrual cycle should be taken, as amenorrhoea is a feature of
polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and
prolactinomas. In addition, galactorrhoea may also be an accompanying
feature of prolactinomas.

[START_SECTION]Drug history
A drug history may identify the use of progestogen-containing hormone
replacement therapy or oral contraceptive pills. Hirsutism may also
result as a side-effect of anabolic steroid use by body builders;
phenytoin for epilepsy; minoxidil for hypertension and ciclosporin as an
immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation.

Associated symptoms
Weight gain may result from Cushing’s syndrome, but is also a common
complaint with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Symptoms such as
headaches, vomiting and visual field loss are suggestive of a pituitary
adenoma, which can result in acromegaly, Cushing’s disease or
hyperprolactinaemia (prolactinoma). Additional symptoms that may
accompany Cushing’s syndrome are easy bruising of the skin,
abdominal striae and proximal muscle weakness. Patients with
acromegaly may also complain of muscle weakness, joint pains,
enlarging features of the face, jaw, hands and feet, with corresponding
increases in hat, glove and shoe sizes. Paraesthesia may also result as a
consequence of entrapment neuropathies. Infertility may result from
hyperprolactinaemia and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

Examination
An assessment should be made regarding the pattern of hair
distribution. With a degree of normal variation, the distribution of hair
growth with hirsutism is on the face, chin, chest and extremities. The
pubic hair may adopt a male pattern, and male type frontal balding can
also be present. Careful inspection for virilism may identify increased
shoulder-girdle muscle mass and enlargement of the clitoris. Truncal
obesity is a feature of Cushing’s syndrome, and generalised obesity
occurs with polycystic ovarian syndrome. This may also be
accompanied by acanthosis nigricans.
Inspection is then continued to identify co-existing endocrine disease.

[START_SECTION]Features of acromegaly are thick greasy skin, prominent supraorbital
ridging, broad nose, prognathism, macroglossia, poor jaw occlusion,
wide interdental separation, enlarged hands and feet. Features of
Cushing’s syndrome are moon-like facies, truncal obesity, buffalo hump,
skin bruising, striae and proximal muscle weakness. Hypertension,
diabetes and visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopia) are associated
with both Cushing’s disease and acromegaly. In addition, visual field
defects may also result from a prolactinoma. Hypertension is also
associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Following this, an abdominal and pelvic examination should be
performed to exclude a mass, which may be suggestive of a large
adrenal or ovarian tumour.

General Investigations
■ Urine dipstick
The presence of glucose may be due to diabetes, which is a feature of
Cushing’s syndrome and acromegaly. In addition, polycystic ovarian
disease is also associated with insulin resistance.
■ U&Es
↓ potassium with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
■ Serum glucose
Diabetes or insulin resistance with Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly
and polycystic ovarian disease.
■ Serum testosterone and DHEA
A marked increase in both suggests an excess of androgens from a
neoplastic origin and warrants detailed investigation.

Specific Investigations
■ 24-hour free urinary cortisol
↑ with Cushing’s syndrome.
■ Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
Failure of suppression occurs with Cushing’s syndrome.

[START_SECTION]■ Oral glucose tolerance test with serial growth hormone estimations
Failure of suppression or increasing growth hormone concentrations
occur with acromegaly.
■ IGF-1
↑ with acromegaly.
■ Plasma prolactin
↑ with prolactinomas.
■ Plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone
↑ with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
■ CA125
↑ with ovarian carcinoma.
■ US abdomen and pelvis
Polycystic ovaries, ovarian carcinoma.
■ CT abdomen and pelvis
Adrenal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma.
■ CT/MRI head
Pituitary tumour.
• Rapid onset or severe hirsutism may give a clue to
underlying serious pathology, e.g. androgen-producing
tumours of the ovaries or adrenal glands.
• Pituitary tumours may present with hirsutism and
associated visual field defects.

[START_SECTION]Hypertension
Hypertension is the elevation of blood pressure. An individual is
classified as hypertensive when there is a sustained rise in blood
pressure to more than 140/90 mmHg on three or more readings, each at
least one week apart. Most patients have essential hypertension and an
underlying cause is identified in less than 10%.

Causes
Renal
• Renal parenchymal diseases, e.g. glomerulonephritis
• Diabetic nephropathy
• Renal artery stenosis (Fig. 35)
• Chronic pyelonephritis
• Polycystic kidney disease
• Connective tissue disease (especially systemic sclerosis)

FIGURE 35 MRA renal arteries.

[START_SECTION]The patient presented with poorly-controlled hypertension. Subsequent
examination revealed a bruit inferior to the left costal margin. MRA
revealed a tight stenosis close to the origin of the left renal artery (arrow).
The stenosis was successfully treated with angioplasty and stenting.

Endocrine
• Adrenal
• Cushing’s syndrome
• Conn’s syndrome
• Phaeochromocytoma
• Acromegaly

Drugs
• Oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives
• Glucocorticoids – corticosteroids
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tyramine
• Mineralocorticoids – liquorice
• Sympathomimetics – nebulised salbutamol

Cardiovascular
• Coarctation of the aorta

Other
• Pregnancy (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia)

History
Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension are asymptomatic
and are identified only in the course of routine physical examination;
however, patients with secondary hypertension may complain of
symptoms from the underlying disorder.
Patients with chronic pyelonephritis may have experienced recurrent
urinary tract infections, with loin pain, pyrexia and rigors or have a

[START_SECTION]history of childhood urinary tract infections or prolonged enuresis.
Hypertension can also complicate glomerular disease; in particular it is
associated with acute nephritic syndrome. Patients with nephritic
syndrome may have experienced an acute illness with fatigue, malaise,
haematuria, oliguria and oedema.
With Conn’s syndrome, patients may complain of muscle weakness
and fatigue due to hypokalaemia and polyuria from impaired urineconcentrating ability. Paroxysms of headache, sweating, palpitations
with flushing may be experienced by patients with
phaeochromocytoma. Classically, these patients have attacks of
hypertension; however, in the majority, the hypertension is sustained.
Weight gain, hair growth, acne, abdominal striae, muscle weakness,
back pain and depression may be some of the symptoms experienced by
patients with Cushing’s syndrome. With acromegaly, patients may
complain of headaches, galactorrhoea, deepening of the voice, muscle
weakness and joint pains. Hats and rings may no longer fit due to
increasing size of the cranium and hands.
A complete drug history will identify offending drugs that may
precipitate hypertension.

Examination
Inspection
On inspection, patients with acromegaly may have thick greasy skin,
large hands, feet and tongue. Prominent supraorbital ridging with a
large nose and protruding jaw accompanied by interdental separation
may be noted on close inspection of the face and teeth. Confrontational
testing of the visual fields may reveal bitemporal hemianopia, which
may also be present with Cushing’s syndrome owing to compression of
the optic chiasma by a pituitary adenoma. Additional features of
Cushing’s disease include truncal obesity, acne, moon-like facies,
bruising, striae, kyphosis and proximal muscle weakness.

[START_SECTION]Palpation and auscultation
In coarctation of the aorta, radiofemoral delay may be appreciated with
simultaneous palpation of the radial and femoral arteries; bruits may be
auscultated across collateral blood vessels along the axilla, chest wall
and scapula. A systolic bruit may also be auscultated over the fourth left
posterior intercostal space. Wide discrepancy of measured blood
pressure may exist between the arm and leg.
Palpation of the abdomen may reveal bilateral ballotable masses due
to enlarged polycystic kidneys, and bruits may be auscultated over
stenosed renal arteries.

General Investigations
■ Urinalysis
Dipstick may indicate the presence of blood and protein. Urine
microscopy is necessary to confirm the presence of red blood cells and
also casts.
■ U&Es
Levels of serum potassium may be reduced with Conn’s syndrome due
to hyperaldosteronism. High levels of creatinine and urea are found
with renal failure.
■ Blood glucose
Atherosclerosis, renal vascular disease and nephropathy may be
associated with diabetes. All of these may contribute to hypertension.
Moreover conditions such as Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly and
phaeochromocytoma are associated with hyperglycaemia.
■ Serum lipids
Serum lipid estimation is used to screen for risk factors for
atherosclerosis, and therapy may be initiated for the prevention of
cerebrovascular and ischaemic heart disease.
■ ECG
A 12-lead ECG is recommended for all patients to provide a baseline and
screen for left ventricular hypertrophy, which may result as a
complication of hypertension.

[START_SECTION]Specific Investigations
■ Autoantibodies
Anti-GBM and ANCA may be positive with glomerulonephritis. ANA
for connective tissue diseases.
■ Plasma catecholamines
Elevated in phaeochromocytoma.
■ Urinary catecholamines, metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid
Elevated in phaeochromocytoma.
■ 24-hour urinary free cortisol
Excess cortisol in Cushing’s syndrome.
■ Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test
Failure of suppression of cortisol occurs in Cushing’s syndrome.
■ Oral glucose tolerance test
Failure of suppression of serum growth hormone occurs in acromegaly.
■ Plasma renin and aldosterone
Hypersecretion of aldosterone in the presence of low plasma renin
levels confirms autonomous secretion in Conn’s syndrome.
■ Pregnancy test
Hypertension occurring with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.
■ US abdomen
Polycystic kidneys. Duplex Doppler can screen for renal artery stenosis.
■ Renal angiography
Renal artery stenosis.
■ Renal biopsy
Renal causes of hypertension.
■ MRA
This is increasingly useful in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis and
avoids the need for potentially nephrotoxic radiocontrast
administration.
■ Cardiac catheterisation
Coarctation of the aorta.
• Severe hypertension must be investigated and treated

[START_SECTION]urgently due to the poor prognosis.
• Improvement in cardiovascular outcomes has been clearly
shown when hypertension is adequately controlled.

[START_SECTION]Impotence
Impotence is failure in the adult male to sustain an adequate erection for
vaginal penetration. Impotence leads to psychological problems, often
with marital breakdown. Psychological causes of impotence are
common but the most common organic disease is diabetes mellitus. The
term ‘loss of libido’ should be reserved for sexual dysfunction relating
from a loss of sexual desire or sexual drive.

Causes

• Aortoiliac disease (Leriche’s syndrome)

Neurological
• Spinal lesions
• Neuropathies, e.g. diabetes
• Spina bifida
• Pelvic surgery (damage to nervi erigentes)

History
Is there a clear history of stress to account for the onset of
impotence? Does the patient experience erections at any time,
especially during the night? History of peripheral vascular
disease, especially buttock claudication (Leriche’s
syndrome)? History of neurological disease? Take a full drug
history, including any recreational drugs. Check for a history
of diabetes, hypothyroidism, Addison’s disease or Cushing’s
disease. Pelvic surgery, e.g. abdominoperineal resection of
the rectum with damage to the nervi erigentes. Check for any
local, painful conditions of the penis. History of malignant
disease. History of chronic renal failure: nausea, lethargy,
nocturia, peripheral oedema, pulmonary oedema, dyspnoea,

[START_SECTION]vomiting, hiccups, convulsions.

Examination
Vascular
Check all the pulses in the lower limb. Listen for bruits in the abdomen
and pelvis.

Neurological
Carry out a full neurological examination.

Endocrine
There will usually be a clear history of diabetes. Complications may be
apparent. Check for peripheral neuropathy. Check for hypothyroidism:
weight gain, dislike of cold weather, hoarse voice, lethargy,
constipation. Check for Cushing’s syndrome – thin skin, cushingoid
facies, abdominal striae, obesity, buffalo hump, hypertension. Check for
Addison’s disease – weakness, weight loss, pigmentation of palmar
creases and buccal mucosa, hypotension. Examine the testes for
hypogonadism. Check for development of male secondary sexual
characteristics.

Local painful conditions
Examine the penis for phimosis, Peyronie’s disease or short frenulum.

Systemic disease
Malignant disease may be obvious. Check for chronic renal failure:
pallor of skin, peripheral oedema, pericarditis, pleural effusions,

[START_SECTION]hypertension. Check for cirrhosis, liver palms, spider naevi, ascites,
leuconychia, flapping tremor, testicular atrophy, Dupuytren’s
contracture.

General Investigations
History and examination suggests the diagnosis in most cases.
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ anaemia, e.g. chronic renal failure and malignancy. ESR ↑
malignancy.
■ U&Es
Creatinine raised in chronic renal failure.
■ LFTs
Abnormal in cirrhosis.
■ Blood glucose
Diabetes mellitus.
■ TFTs
↑ TSH ↓ T4 in hypothyroidism.
■ Doppler studies
Peripheral vascular disease. Penile-brachial pressure index<0.6 suggests
a vascular cause.

Specific Investigations
■ Nocturnal penile tumescence study
Erection versus no erection.
■ Intracorporeal injection of papaverine
If no abnormality of arterial inflow, this should cause an erection. If
there is excessive venous leakage, the penis remains flaccid.
■ MRI or CT head
Pituitary abnormality.
■ Arteriography
May show vascular lesion, especially isolated narrowings of the internal
iliac arteries.

[START_SECTION]■ Serum prolactin
Hypoprolactinaemia.
■ Serum testosterone
Low in hypogonadism.
■ Serum FSH and LH
Low in pituitary dysfunction.
■ ACTH stimulation test
Addison’s disease.
■ Urinary cortisol assay
Cushing’s syndrome.
■ Plasma cortisol
Cushing’s syndrome.
• Loss of libido may be an early manifestation of significant
depressive illness.
• Thorough investigation for possible organic or psychogenic
disease is necessary.

[START_SECTION]Intestinal Obstruction
Mechanical obstruction of the bowel may be simple (one-point
obstruction) or closed loop (obstruction at two points enclosing a
segment of bowel). If the bowel is viable, the obstruction is termed nonstrangulating. If the arterial blood supply is compromised, strangulating
obstruction occurs with subsequent infarction of the bowel. Intestinal
obstruction is a common surgical emergency.

Causes
Small Bowel
In the Lumen
• Gallstone ileus
• Food bolus (after pylorus-destroying or bypass surgery)

In the Wall
• Crohn’s disease
• Atresia
• TB • (common in areas of the world where TB is endemic)
• Tumour, e.g. lymphoma, carcinoma

Outside the Wall
• Hernia

• Volvulus
• Intussusception

Large Bowel

[START_SECTION]In the Lumen

Adynamic Obstruction (Paralytic Ileus)
• Peritonitis
• Postoperative
• Hypokalaemia
• Spinal and pelvic fractures
• Retroperitoneal haemorrhage
• Retroperitoneal malignancy
• Drugs, e.g. ganglion blockers, anticholinergics
• Immobilisation

History
Small bowel
Central abdominal colicky pain. Vomiting – food, bile, faeculent,
depending upon the level of obstruction. Distension – degree depends on
level of obstruction. There may be very little distension with high small
bowel obstruction. It may be gross with low small bowel obstruction.
Constipation. There may be a history of abdominal surgery to suggest
adhesive obstruction. The patient may be aware of a hernia.

[START_SECTION]Large bowel
Central (right colon to two-thirds of the way along the transverse colon)
or lower abdominal colicky pain (remainder of the colon). Constipation.
Vomiting is a late feature with large bowel obstruction. Abdominal
distension. There may be a previous history of change in bowel habit
and bleeding PR to suggest carcinoma. A long history of constipation
(years) and abdominal distension suggest Hirschsprung’s disease.
Development of a constant severe pain suggests infarction.

Adynamic obstruction
Carefully check the drug history. Patients on anticoagulants may have
retroperitoneal haemorrhage. Precipitating cause may be obvious, e.g.
recent surgery or spinal fracture. The abdominal distension may be
painless but uncomfortable. Vomiting, constipation. The elderly
immobilised in bed are especially vulnerable.

Examination
Small bowel
Observe for scars. Exclude obstructed incisional hernia. Check hernial
orifices. It is easy to miss a small femoral hernia in an obese patient.
Distended tympanitic abdomen usually non-tender. High-pitched
tinkling obstructed bowel sounds. Pyrexia, tachycardia and localised
tenderness suggest impending infarction. A palpable mass in the right
iliac fossa may suggest Crohn’s disease or caecal carcinoma
(obstructing the ileocaecal valve and causing small bowel obstruction).
Carry out a digital rectal examination.

Large bowel
Distended tympanitic abdomen, which may be very tense. Obstructed
bowel sounds. Rectum may be empty on examination PR unless

[START_SECTION]obstruction is due to faecal impaction. A mass may be palpable to
suggest an obstructing carcinoma. A palpable, tense, tender caecum
suggests closed loop obstruction with a competent ileocaecal valve.
Caecal perforation may be imminent.

Adynamic obstruction
Abdominal distension. Tense tympanitic abdomen. Absent bowel
sounds. Evidence of previous surgery, trauma, retroperitoneal
haemorrhage and peritonitis, fractures.

General Investigations
■ Hb, FBC
Hb ↓ malignancy. WCC ↑ infection, infarcted bowel.
■ U&Es and creatinine
Dehydration. Hypokalaemia leading to paralytic ileus.
■ Clotting screen
May be abnormal with retroperitoneal haemorrhage, especially if
patient on anticoagulants.
■ AXR
Distended loops of bowel in central abdomen. Proximal small bowel
shows lines closely together completely crossing the lumen of the bowel
(valvulae conniventes) (Fig. 36). These get progressively further apart
until there are none seen in the terminal ileum. Gas in the biliary tree
(gallstone ileus). Large bowel obstruction – distended bowel with airfluid levels at the periphery of the abdomen. Sigmoid volvulus –
distended loop of bowel, the shape of a ‘coffee bean’, arising out of the
pelvis on the left side.
■ Sigmoidoscopy
Tumour at rectosigmoid. Sigmoid volvulus may be decompressed by
careful insertion of sigmoidoscope. Biopsy – carcinoma, absence of
ganglion cells in Hirschsprung’s disease.

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 36 Small bowel obstruction.
Distended loops of small bowel are visible in the central abdomen. These are
identifiable as small bowel as the valvulae conniventes (arrows) cross the entire lumen
of the bowel.

Specific Investigations
■ Barium enema
Limited barium enema may show ‘apple core’ lesion of carcinoma.
‘Bird’s beak’ sign of sigmoid volvulus. Intussusception.
■ Small bowel enema
Crohn’s disease. TB of the terminal ileum. Small bowel carcinoma.
■ CT
Retroperitoneal haemorrhage. Retroperitoneal tumour.
• Tachycardia, pyrexia, localised tenderness and neutrophil
leucocytosis are signs of impending infarction. Urgent
surgical exploration is required.
• In large bowel obstruction, a tense, tender palpable caecum
is a sign of closed loop obstruction, with a risk of impending
caecal perforation. Urgent laparotomy is required.
• A radiological diameter of the caecum of over 10 cm is a
sign of imminent rupture of the caecum. Urgent laparotomy is
required.
• It can be difficult to distinguish between pseudo-obstruction
(ileus or adynamic obstruction) and large bowel obstruction.
Gaseous distension all the way along the large bowel,

[START_SECTION]including rectum, suggests pseudo-obstruction. A sharp ‘cutoff’ of the gas shadow in the colon suggests obstruction, e.g. in
the LIF with recto-sigmoid carcinoma.

[START_SECTION]Jaundice
Jaundice is yellow discoloration of the tissues, noticed especially in the
skin and sclera (Figs 28, 37), due to accumulation of bilirubin. For
jaundice to be clinically apparent, the circulating bilirubin levels should
be in excess of 35 µmol/L. Jaundice may be prehepatic (due to
haemolysis), hepatic (due to intrinsic liver disease) or cholestatic (due to
either intrahepatic cholestasis or post-hepatic biliary tract obstruction).

FIGURE 37 Jaundiced sclera in a patient with hepatitis.
Mild jaundice is evident in the sclera. There is no obvious jaundice in the skin. Jaundice
in the sclera is usually clinically apparent when the circulating bilirubin levels are in
excess of 35 μmol/L.

History

[START_SECTION]General
Fever, malaise, weight loss, dark urine, pale stools, itching.

Newborn
Biliary atresia presents as deepening jaundice within 2–3 days of birth.
Liver failure develops over 3–6 months. Physiological jaundice is
common and is due to immaturity of liver function. It usually settles
within the first week of life.

Prehepatic
Ask about family history, racial origin, drugs, haematuria, history of
anaemia. Gilbert’s disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant. There
is a failure of uptake of unconjugated bilirubin by the hepatocyte.
Crigler–Najjar syndrome is a failure of conjugation within the
hepatocyte.

Hepatocellular
Occupation. Contact with jaundice. Travel. Alcohol. Sexual activity.
Drugs (tablets, injections, anaesthetic agents, drug abuse). Exposure to
industrial solvents. Previous episodes of jaundice. Infection. Influenzalike symptoms. Rashes. Joint pains. Blood transfusions.

Cholestatic
Drugs, e.g. chlorpromazine. Travel abroad. Severe upper abdominal
pain preceding jaundice (biliary colic followed by impaction of stone in
common bile duct). Insidious onset of painless jaundice (malignancy).
Dark urine, pale stools, itching.

Examination

[START_SECTION]Prehepatic (haemolytic)
Often the jaundice is not intense, with only a mild lemon tinge.
Anaemia. Splenomegaly.

Hepatic
Tender liver in hepatitis. Signs of liver failure: spider naevi, palmar
erythema, leuconychia, clubbing, gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy,
ascites, peripheral oedema, bruising, Dupuytren’s contracture, caput
medusae, liver flap. Haematemesis may have occurred from bleeding
oesophageal varices.

Cholestatic
Hepatomegaly – usually smooth liver with ‘sharp’ edge. Palpable gall
bladder (Courvoisier’s law – in the presence of obstructive jaundice if
the gall bladder is palpable, the cause is unlikely to be due to
gallstones). Epigastric mass, e.g. carcinoma of the pancreas. Other
abdominal masses, e.g. carcinoma of the stomach and carcinoma of the
colon with secondary deposits in the porta hepatis. Recent surgical
scars. Scratch marks on abdomen from itching.

• Painless progressive jaundice suggests carcinoma of the
pancreas, especially in the presence of a palpable gall bladder
(Courvoisier’s law).
• Ask about foreign travel contact, drug abuse contact and
sexual history in patients with sudden onset of jaundice and
fever.

[START_SECTION]Jaw Pain and Swellings
Pain and/or swelling of the jaw results most commonly from dental
conditions. In the upper jaw, pain may also result from infection of the
paranasal sinuses. The latter condition is considered under Facial
swellings (p. 134).

Causes
Traumatic
Infective
• Dental abscess
• Acute osteomyelitis
• Actinomycosis

Temporomandibular Joint
• Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Osteoarthritis
• Dislocation

Cystic
• Dental cysts (Fig. 38)
• Dentigerous cysts

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 38 A large dental cyst in the mandible.
The cyst arose from tooth-forming epithelial remnants in the apical area of
the lower left 2nd premolar tooth, which was extracted several months
beforehand due to chronic periapical infection.

Neoplastic
Benign
• Giant cell granuloma

Locally Invasive
• Ameloblastoma

Malignant
• Osteogenic sarcoma
• Burkitt’s lymphoma • (endemic in equatorial Africa)
• Secondary deposits

Other
• Referred pain (e.g. myocardial ischaemia)
• Giant cell (temporal) arteritis
• Post-herpetic neuralgia
• Osteonecrosis of the mandible, e.g. steroid therapy,
bisphosphonates for osteoporosis, radiotherapy

[START_SECTION]History
Traumatic
History of trauma, e.g. fights, road traffic accidents. Fracture of the
mandible is the most common.

Infective
Dental abscess presents with a dull ache in the jaw, becoming throbbing
and severe. There is often accompanying malaise and loss of appetite.
Previous history of dental caries. Acute osteomyelitis of the mandible is
rare. It may follow dental infection or tooth extraction. There may be a
history of fractures, irradiation, leukaemia, diabetes, malnutrition,
alcoholism or immunosuppression. There is a severe, throbbing deepseated pain. The patient has difficulty opening the mouth and
swallowing due to muscle oedema. Actinomycosis presents with
swelling of the jaw with persistent low-grade infection.

Temporomandibular joint
Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome results from
grinding and clenching the teeth. The patient may have had a stressrelated illness. Pain arises in the region of the temporomandibular joint
or ear, which may be associated with a clicking noise and is aggravated
by wide opening of the mouth, as with yawning and chewing.
Rheumatoid arthritis of the temporomandibular joint is rare. Other signs
and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are usually apparent.
Osteoarthritis usually causes pain, swelling and limitation of jaw
movement. Temporomandibular joint dislocation may be recurrent,
habitual or isolated. The condyle is displaced forwards and upwards
into the temporal fossa. The patient’s mouth remains open and cannot be
closed following yawning, tooth extraction or general anaesthesia. The
condition may be unilateral or bilateral. The patient presents with an
open mouth, which he or she cannot close, and pain due to muscle

[START_SECTION]spasm.

Cystic
Cysts often present as asymptomatic lucencies on radiographs.
Otherwise, they present as painless swellings, which may reach a large
size. If the cyst becomes infected, the patient presents with pain,
swelling and discharge. Occasionally pathological fractures occur. A
dental cyst is attached to the root of a normally erupted but decayed
tooth; the swelling grows slowly. Dentigerous cysts contain an
unerupted tooth.

Neoplastic
The patient presents with a jaw swelling which grows steadily and often
painlessly. Giant cell granuloma may erode through bone to produce a
soft-tissue purplish swelling on the gum. Ameloblastomas usually occur
around the age of 30–50 years and are symptomless until the swelling
becomes obtrusive. Osteogenic sarcoma of the jaw is extremely rare.
Initially it is painless but becomes painful as it grows. Teeth may be
loosened. The patient may complain of paraesthesia due to involvement
of the mental nerve. Coughing may be a symptom if lung metastases
have occurred. Burkitt’s tumour is associated with EBV. It is a malignant
tumour of B lymphocytes. It is endemic in certain parts of Africa and
New Guinea. Most commonly it affects children below the age of 12
years. The child presents with a progressive painless swelling of the jaw.
Secondary deposits in the jaw are uncommon but may arise from lung,
breast, thyroid, prostate or kidney.

Others
With post-herpetic neuralgia, there is usually a history of herpes zoster
in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. The pain tends to be
distributed in a division of the trigeminal nerve. Pain may involve a
large area of the face, rather than just the region of the jaw. Referred pain

[START_SECTION]to the jaw is common with angina. The patient usually complains of
associated chest pain and radiation of the pain down the left arm. With
giant cell arteritis, there will be pain in the jaw on chewing (jaw
claudication). In addition, there will be other symptoms of temporal
arteritis, e.g. headache precipitated by touch and tenderness in the
temporal area. With osteonecrosis of the jaw, ask about steroid and
bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis and past history of
radiotherapy.

Examination
Traumatic
Check for a normal bite. Bruising, swelling, crepitus, tenderness.
Bloodstained saliva. Broken teeth. Step deformities in occlusion.

Infective
With dental abscesses, there is reddening of the mucosa with a firm, hot,
acutely tender, boggy swelling. The dental abscess may point on the
outer side of the jaw. There may be associated dental caries and
gingivitis. Cervical lymphadenopathy is usually present. With acute
osteomyelitis, there is usually difficulty in opening the mouth and
swallowing due to muscle oedema. There is a tender, red, painful
swelling overlying the mandible. In actinomycosis, there may be
multiple discharging sinuses, usually near the angle of the jaw, on which
characteristic ‘sulphur granules’ may be seen discharging.

Temporomandibular joint
Diagnosis of temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome is usually
made from the history. There is usually trismus and spasm around the
joint. In rheumatoid arthritis, there may be tenderness and swelling over
the joint. In osteoarthritis, there may be swelling over the joint and
limitation of movement. In temporomandibular joint dislocation, the

[START_SECTION]condyles are palpable anterior to the articular eminence. The mouth is
gagged open.

Cystic
Often the only abnormality on examination is a swelling in the bones.
Sometimes the bone is so thin that it crackles when touched, like a
broken eggshell. With dentigerous cysts, the tooth remains unerupted
and therefore a tooth will be missing when the teeth are counted.

Neoplastic
Often the only abnormality is a bony swelling, which grows steadily,
initially without pain. With giant cell granuloma it may rarely erode
through the bone to produce soft-tissue purplish swelling on the gum.
Osteogenic sarcoma is initially painless but as it grows, it may loosen
the teeth. Check for loose teeth and paraesthesia in the distribution of the
mental nerve. Examine the lung for metastases. With Burkitt’s
lymphoma, there is progressive painless swelling. The eye may be
displaced and the mouth partly occluded by the swelling. Secondary
deposits often present as painful lesions within the bone. Check for a
previous history of malignancy and check the lungs, breast, prostate,
kidney and thyroid for the site of a primary.

Other
The diagnosis of post-herpetic neuralgia is usually made on the history,
as is referred pain from myocardial ischaemia.

[START_SECTION]Joint Disorders
Disorders of joints are common problems. They may be acute, as in gout
or rheumatic fever, or chronic, as in osteoarthritis. Some acute disorders
go on to become chronic, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. The first part of this
section deals with causes of arthropathy in general; the second part
deals with disorders of specific joints. The list of causes of arthropathies
is legion and only the more common ones will be mentioned.

Causes
Congenital
• Achondroplasia (dwarfism)
• Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
• Marfan’s syndrome
• Osteogenesis imperfecta

Acquired
Infective
• Pyogenic arthritis
• Viral
• TB • (very common in the developing world and on the increase
in developed countries)
• Rheumatic fever • (very common in developing countries)
• Endocarditis
• Brucellosis
• Typhoid • (very common in developing countries)

[START_SECTION]Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Polymyalgia rheumatica (predominantly in Caucasian
women)
• Psoriatic arthropathy
• Henoch–Schönlein disease
• Reactive arthritis (Reiter’s disease)

• Connective tissue disease

Degenerative
• Osteoarthritis (Fig. 39)

FIGURE 39 Osteoarthritis of the right hip joint.
The joint space is diminished and there is sclerosis of the surrounding
bone. On the left side, the patient has had an arthroplasty (hip
replacement).

Neoplastic
• Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy

Other
• Avascular necrosis of bone
• Sarcoidosis
• Behçet’s disease • (more common in certain Mediterranean
countries)

History
Congenital
Premature osteoarthritis may occur in achondroplasia. In Ehlers–Danlos
syndrome, a genetic disorder of connective tissue, patients display

[START_SECTION]hypermobile joints and hyperextensible skin. They may present with
joint subluxation, dislocation and swelling due to effusions. They may
also present with the bleeding complications of Ehlers–Danlos
syndrome. In Marfan’s syndrome, generalised joint laxity occurs with
patients presenting with joint pain and swelling due to effusions. In
osteogenesis imperfecta, bony fracture is common.

Acquired
Infective
Septic arthritis usually presents as a monoarthritis with a red, swollen,
painful, immobile joint. Spread has usually occurred by the
haematogenous route but may occur from adjacent osteomyelitis.
Organisms responsible include Staphylococcus aureus streptococci,
gonococcus, Brucella and Salmonella spp. With TB, the patient usually
presents subacutely with swelling and stiffness of the joint. It is not as
erythematous or warm as with acute septic arthritis. Patients on steroids
or who are immunosuppressed are particularly at risk from infective
arthritis. Viral arthritis may occur with rubella, mumps, hepatitis and
certain enteroviruses. Rheumatic fever usually follows a streptococcal
infection, e.g. scarlet fever or tonsillitis. There is a migratory
polyarthritis, together with carditis, erythematous skin lesions and
subcutaneous nodules.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis most often presents with swollen, painful, stiff
hands and feet. Eventually characteristic hand deformities with swelling
of the metacarpophalangeal joints, swan-neck and boutonnière
deformities, and ulnar deviation occur. Large joints are also involved.
The patient may complain of extra-articular manifestations, i.e.
rheumatoid nodules, pulmonary disease and eye changes. Psoriatic
arthropathy usually follows several years after the skin lesions.
Reactive/Reiter’s disease may present with a mono- or oligoarthritis. A
history of gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection is present with

[START_SECTION]associated urethritis and conjunctivitis. Ankylosing spondylitis most
commonly affects young males and initially presents with morning
stiffness in the lower spine. The sacroiliac joints are invariably involved.
Eventually, bony ankylosis occurs with a fixed kyphotic spine. The
patient may also complain of symptoms in peripheral large joints.
Arthritis may occur in SLE. Other manifestations may be present, e.g.
cutaneous, pulmonary or renal. Polymyalgia rheumatica occurs in
elderly Caucasian women. There is aching and morning stiffness with a
mild polyarthritis. Henoch–Schönlein purpura presents with a purpuric
rash, often over the buttocks and extensor surfaces. There may be
associated nephritis and abdominal pain. Pain, swelling and stiffness in
the joints, usually the ankles and knees, is transient.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis usually occurs after the age of 50 years, unless it is
secondary to previous joint pathology. The patient complains of pain on
movement, worse at the end of the day, together with stiffness and
instability of joints. Bony swelling may be present.

Enteropathic
Check for a history of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. There may
also be a history of gastric bypass surgery. The spine or the peripheral
joints may be affected.

Endocrine
Acromegaly will lead to arthralgia. The patient will usually complain of
other symptoms, namely enlarged hands and feet (increase in shoe size)
and deepening of the voice.

Metabolic
Gout usually presents with severe pain, redness and swelling in the first
metatarsophalangeal joint; however, any joint may be affected. There
may be a history of polycythaemia, leukaemia or medication with

[START_SECTION]cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs. With haemochromatosis, the
diagnosis will usually be apparent when the patient presents. There will
be cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiomyopathy and skin pigmentation.

Neuropathic
The patient usually complains of swollen joints, which are unstable but
painless. There may be a history of diabetes, tabes dorsalis (syphilis),
syringomyelia or leprosy.

Haematological
Bleeding into joints (haemarthrosis) occurs in haemophilia. The history
will be apparent. Eventually crippling arthropathy occurs. Pain in bones
and joints may occur in both childhood and adult leukaemia. In sickle
cell disease, painful crises may occur in bones and joints. Avascular
necrosis of bone may occur.

Drugs
Anticoagulants may cause bleeds into joints. Steroids may lead to septic
arthritis or avascular necrosis of bone, with subsequent secondary
degenerative disease.

Neoplastic
Rarely, a patient will present with direct infiltration of a joint with
malignant disease. However, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy
is more common, occurring usually in association with bronchial
carcinoma, but it may occur in association with congenital heart
disease.

Other
Avascular necrosis of bone may lead to secondary arthritis. The most
common sites are the head of the femur, proximal tibia, proximal
scaphoid, talus and lunate. Check for a history of steroid use. Avascular
necrosis of the scaphoid will follow scaphoid fracture, and avascular

[START_SECTION]necrosis of the head of the femur may follow fractures of the neck of the
femur or slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Arthralgia may occur in
sarcoidosis. The patient presents with fever, malaise and
lymphadenopathy and erythema nodosum. Behçet’s disease may present
with arthritis. Usually there are eye signs, mouth ulcers and genital
ulcers. CNS involvement with meningoencephalitis may occur.

Examination
Congenital
Achondroplasia is obvious. In Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, there will be
hypermobile joints and hyperextensible skin. There may be evidence of
dislocation or subluxation of joints. In Marfan’s syndrome, the patient
will be tall with long extremities, long fingers (arachnodactyly), higharched palate, lens dislocation and aortic incompetence. Diagnosis of
osteogenesis imperfecta will usually be obvious. There is stunted
growth due to repeated fractures with deformities. The patient has blue
sclerae and often hypotonia.

Acquired
Infective
With infective arthritis there is usually a red, painful, swollen, tender
joint, which has virtually no active or passive movement. The patient
will be pyrexial. Usually, a single joint is involved. With viral infections,
there may be signs of childhood illness, e.g. mumps (swollen salivary
glands), rubella (rash), hepatitis (jaundice). With rheumatic fever, there
will be carditis with changing murmurs, migratory polyarthritis,
subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum and occasionally chorea
(Sydenham’s).

Inflammatory
With rheumatoid arthritis, there will be swelling of the

[START_SECTION]metacarpophalangeal, PIP and wrist joints. Swan-neck and boutonnière
deformities will be apparent, as will ulnar deviation. There may be
subluxation at the wrist. Tendon ruptures may occur. Large joint
involvement is common and atlantoaxial subluxation with myelopathy
may develop. General signs include anaemia, nodulosis and eye signs.
With psoriatic arthropathy psoriasis of the skin is usually present. With
reactive/Reiter’s disease, there may be urethritis, conjunctivitis,
keratoderma blenorrhagica, circinate balanitis, plantar fasciitis and
Achilles tendonitis. With ankylosing spondylitis, there may be minimal
signs initially, the first sign usually being a reduced range of movement
of the lumbar spine, but eventually there will be involvement of the
sacroiliac joints together with a loss of the lumbar lordosis and a fixed
kyphotic spine. Reduced respiratory excursion may occur. SLE may
present with malaise, arthralgia, myalgia, a butterfly rash on the face,
Raynaud’s phenomenon, splenomegaly, pleurisy, pleural effusion,
pericarditis. Polymyalgia rheumatica is associated with tender muscles,
mild polyarthritis and there may be associated temporal arteritis.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis usually involves the distal interphalangeal joints
(Heberden’s nodes), the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, the
first metatarsophalangeal joint, the cervical spine, the lumbar spine, the
hips and knees. There will be joint tenderness and limitation of
movement.

Enteropathic
There is normally spondyloarthritis with sacroiliitis. Large joint
monoarthropathy is common, although many peripheral joints may be
involved.

Endocrine
With acromegaly, there will be large hands and feet, a macroglossia,
prognathism, arthralgia, kyphosis, deep voice and heart failure. There

[START_SECTION]may be signs of the pituitary tumour, i.e. bilateral hemianopia due to
local pressure on the optic chiasma.

Metabolic
There is an acutely painful, red, swollen joint with gout. The first
metatarsophalangeal joint is most often involved (podagra) but any joint
may be affected. There may be evidence of gouty tophi, e.g. pinna,
tendons, joints. With haemochromatosis, in addition to arthropathy,
there may be evidence of hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, diabetes,
cardiomyopathy and skin pigmentation.

Neuropathic
Deformed, painless joints with subluxation may occur. There is usually
no warmth or tenderness in relation to the joint. Abnormal movement
may occur. Neurological examination may reveal dorsal column signs.
If the condition is due to syphilis (tabes dorsalis), there may be Argyll
Robertson pupils.

Haematological
With haemophiliacs, the patient will present with an acute, painful,
immobile joint following a bleed. Eventually, there will be deformed
joints. Joints may be involved in leukaemia and acute sickle cell crises.

Drugs
Steroids may cause avascular necrosis, especially of the hips. There will
be pain and limitation of movement. Osteoarthritis develops eventually.
Patients on anticoagulants may have acute haemarthroses.

Neoplastic
Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy usually occurs in association
with bronchial carcinoma. The ends of long bones are affected by
symmetrical but irregular widespread thickening. Clubbing usually
occurs. Pain from local tumours is constant and may progress to a

[START_SECTION]pathological fracture.

Other
With avascular necrosis of bone, there is usually severe pain, tenderness
and limitation of movement. Ultimately osteoarthritis develops. With
sarcoidosis, there is usually fever, lymphadenopathy,
hepatosplenomegaly, erythema nodosum, eye signs, cardiac signs and
CNS involvement. With Behçet’s disease, there will be arthritis, keratitis,
uveitis, mouth ulcers, genital ulcers and occasionally CNS involvement.

Individual Joints
The following section covers individual joints. It must be appreciated
that the conditions covered in joint disorders (above) can involve almost
any joint; however, the conditions described under the individual joints
(below) will refer to those conditions that normally affect, or cause pain
in, the region of the particular joint.

Shoulder
Causes
Congenital
• Klippel–Feil syndrome

Acquired
Traumatic
• Dislocation
• Fracture of the neck of the humerus
• Fracture of the clavicle
• Fracture of the scapula

Degenerative
• Supraspinatus tendinosis
• Impingement syndromes

[START_SECTION]• Rotator cuff tears
• Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)
• Osteoarthritis
• Acromioclavicular
• Glenohumeral

Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Crystal disease (gout, pseudogout)

Infective
• Septic arthritis
• Tuberculous arthritis

Neoplastic
• Metastases in the upper end of the humerus/ribs/neck

Referred Pain
• Cervical spondylosis
• Diaphragmatic irritation
• Pancoast’s tumour

Neurological
• Winged scapula

History
Congenital
In Klippel–Feil syndrome, the neck is short and there are anomalies of
the cervical vertebrae; the scapula is placed superiorly.

Acquired
Traumatic

[START_SECTION]With dislocation of the shoulder, there is usually a history of a fall on
the outstretched hand. Recurrent dislocation may occur. The patient
presents in pain supporting the arm, which is abducted. Anterior
dislocation is the most common, but posterior dislocation is often
missed and can occur after trauma such as fits or electric shocks. With
dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint, there is usually a history of a
fall on the shoulder (common in rugby players). Fracture of the surgical
neck of the humerus occurs with a fall on the shoulder. The patient
presents with pain, deformity and inability to move the shoulder.
Clavicular fracture is usually caused by a fall on the outstretched hand
or point of the shoulder. Scapular fractures are usually high-energy
injuries often due to RTAs.

Degenerative
Supraspinatus tendinosis results from degeneration, inflammation or
calcification of the tendon. There may be sudden pain or there may be
just a painful arc at the initiation of movement. With impingement
syndromes, the rotator cuff becomes compressed under the acromion or
acromioclavicular joint, resulting in pain on abducting the arm. A
painful arc suggests subacromial pathology. Rotator cuff tears often
occur in older patients and probably relate to degeneration of the cuff. In
the younger, fit patient, the rotator cuff tear may be due to violent
trauma with rupture of supraspinatus. The patient is unable to initiate
abduction of the arm but passive movement is normal. Frozen shoulder
(adhesive capsulitis) usually affects the middle-aged and there may be a
history of minor injury. There is pain and limitation of both active and
passive movement of the shoulder. The pain is often severe and disturbs
sleep. It may occur in the elderly following immobilisation of the arm,
e.g. following a Colles’ fracture or stroke. It is more common in
diabetics. Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint presents as pain
associated with overhead movement and a high painful arc (>140°).
Osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint may be idiopathic or follow
avascular necrosis, or radionecrosis following radiotherapy for
carcinoma of the breast. The patient complains of pain on shoulder

[START_SECTION]movement and night pain.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis is more common than osteoarthritis in the
shoulder joint. There is usually a history of rheumatoid arthritis
elsewhere. A history of gout or pseudogout may be evident.

Infective
The patient presents with a painful, red, swollen joint with limited
movement. TB of the shoulder is extremely rare in the UK. There are
systemic symptoms of malaise and fever and there is usually wasting of
the muscle around the shoulder joint.

Neoplastic
Secondary deposits may occur in the upper end of the humerus, giving
rise to pain. Pathological fractures may occur. Check for a history of
carcinoma of the bronchus, breast, thyroid, prostate or kidney.

Referred pain
This is an extremely common cause of shoulder pain. Cervical
spondylosis often results in referred pain to the upper part of the
shoulder. Check for a history of neck pain with limitation of movement
of the neck. Irritation of the diaphragm may refer pain to the dermatome
C4 at the shoulder tip. This may be due to peritonitis below the
diaphragm or pleurisy above. The symptoms of peritonitis will be
obvious. A history of chest problems should be sought if Pancoast’s
tumour is suspected, especially if Horner’s syndrome is present.

Neurological
Winged scapula may cause difficulty with shoulder movements. Check
for recent surgery to the neck or axilla, e.g. axillary clearance in breast
carcinoma, which may damage the long thoracic nerve. Carrying heavy
loads on the shoulders over a prolonged period of time may also be

[START_SECTION]responsible.

Examination
Congenital
Klippel–Feil syndrome. The patient will present with a short neck and a
highly placed scapula. Other congenital conditions may be present.

Acquired
Traumatic
With dislocation of the shoulder, the patient supports the arm. The
normal contour of the shoulder is lost. Check for axillary nerve damage
(anaesthesia over the ‘badge’ area). With acromioclavicular dislocation,
there will be a palpable lump at the site of dislocation. With fracture of
the surgical neck of the humerus, there will be pain and tenderness, and
inability to abduct the arm due to pain. Check for axillary nerve damage.
With fractures of the clavicle, the patient supports the weight of the arm
with the other hand. The site of the break is usually palpable.

Degenerative
There will be limitation of movement. Check for a painful arc. Check for
the ability to initiate abduction (supraspinatus tendon tears). With
frozen shoulder and osteoarthritis, there is limitation of active and
passive movements. Check for mastectomy scars or signs of
radiotherapy. With osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint, there is
usually obvious prominence of the joint, with localised tenderness and a
high painful arc.

Inflammatory
With rheumatoid arthritis, there are often signs elsewhere. There may be
fever, malaise and heat in the joint. Glenohumeral movements may
cause crepitus. Features of gout may be evident such as the presence of

[START_SECTION]tophi.

Infective
There will be a red, hot, swollen, tender joint. There may be a focus of
infection elsewhere in the body.

Neoplastic
There may be little to find on examination or there may be a
pathological fracture with pain, local tenderness and limitation of
movement.

Referred pain
Check for movements of the cervical spine. Carry out a full neurological
examination. With referred pain from the diaphragm, examine the
abdomen for tenderness, guarding and rigidity. Examine the chest for
signs of pneumonia, pleurisy or tumour.

Neurological
Check for scars in the neck or axilla. Note the winging of the scapula
when the patient pushes the hand against a wall with the arm forward
flexed to 90° (protraction of the scapula).

Elbow
Causes
Traumatic
• Supracondylar fracture of the humerus
• Dislocation of the elbow
• Pulled elbow
• Fracture of the radial head
• Fractured olecranon
• Fractured epicondyle/condyle
• Myositis ossificans

Degenerative
• Osteoarthritis
• Osteochondritis dissecans

Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis

[START_SECTION]Neurological
• Nerve entrapment, e.g. ulnar, posterior interosseous and
median

Other
• Olecranon bursitis
• Tennis elbow
• Golfer’s elbow
• Cubitus varus/valgus

History
Traumatic
Supracondylar fracture is chiefly a fracture of childhood. There is a
history of a fall on the outstretched hand followed by pain and swelling
around the elbow. This is a significant injury with several serious
complications. Dislocation of the elbow may occur in children or adults.
The symptoms are similar to those of supracondylar fracture. Pulled
elbow occurs in children aged 2–6 years. The radial head slips out of the
annular ligament. The child may have been ‘swinging’ with the parents
holding the hands. Fractures of the olecranon may result as a fall on the
point of the elbow or by sudden contraction of the triceps. Condylar and
epicondylar fractures are rare and easily missed. With myositis
ossificans, there will be a history of a supracondylar fracture or
dislocation of the elbow. A calcified haematoma forms in front of the
joint. Movement of the joint, especially flexion, is affected. It may follow
ill-advised physiotherapy with passive stretching of the joints after
trauma or after surgery.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis of the elbow may occur in heavy manual workers or

[START_SECTION]following complicated fractures involving the joint. Osteochondritis
dissecans may cause elbow pain and restrict movement because of a
loose body in the joint.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis may affect the elbow joint. There will usually be
signs of rheumatoid arthritis elsewhere. If there is gross disorganisation
of the joint with deformity, the ulnar nerve may be involved and there
may be symptoms of ulnar nerve palsy. Gout may affect the elbow joint.

Neurological
Various nerve entrapment syndromes can occur around the elbow.
Symptoms may present in the distribution of ulnar, median or posterior
interosseous nerves.

Other
Olecranon bursitis results in painful or painless swelling over the
olecranon. It is common in carpet layers and students (students rest their
heads in their hands, while studying late into the night with their elbows
resting on the desk). The bursa may become infected with a red, tender,
hot swelling. Tennis elbow is common between the ages of 30 and 50
years. It presents with pain on the lateral side of the elbow. It affects
tennis players and anyone whose job involves extending and twisting
the forearm. The pain is often worse on gripping. Golfer’s elbow is
similar to tennis elbow but affects the medial epicondyle. The patient
complains of pain and tenderness over the medial epicondyle and also of
pain on hyperextending the fingers and wrists. Cubitus valgus/varus
may follow fractures around the elbow in childhood. Cubitus valgus
may progressively stretch the ulnar nerve, with a slowly developing
ulnar nerve palsy.

Examination

[START_SECTION]Examination
Traumatic
With supracondylar fractures, there will be swelling around the elbow
joint and limitation of movement. The olecranon, medial epicondyle and
lateral epicondyle preserve their normal relationship with one another
in an equilateral triangle. Damage to the brachial artery and median or
radial nerve may occur. With posterior dislocation at the elbow, the
triangular relationship referred to above is lost. Otherwise, the findings
are similar. It is important to check the distal circulation and to assess
for median and radial nerve palsies. With a fracture of the olecranon,
there is swelling and tenderness directly over the olecranon. With
damage to the medial epicondyle, it is important to test the integrity of
the ulnar nerve. With myositis ossificans, a calcified mass occurs in
front of the elbow joint and there will be limitation of flexion. With
radial head fractures, the patient will be focally tender over the radial
head and there will be lack of full extension.

Degenerative
With osteoarthritis, there are often few signs. There may be bony
swelling of the joint with loss of movement and crepitus. With
osteochondritis dissecans, there may be restriction in movement,
crepitus and locking of the joint due to a loose body.

Inflammatory
With rheumatoid arthritis, there will often be signs elsewhere. In
longstanding arthritis, there will be a swollen, disrupted joint with
deformity. Check the integrity of the ulnar nerve. Tophi may be present
in gout.

Neurological
Examine carefully in the distribution of the median, ulnar and radial
nerve.

[START_SECTION]Other
With olecranon bursitis, there will be a swelling over the olecranon.
This is fluid-filled and exhibits fluctuation and transilluminates. With
infection it may become red and tender. With tennis elbow, there is
tenderness over the lateral epicondyle. Pronating the forearm while
extending the elbow exacerbates the pain. With golfer’s elbow, there is
tenderness over the medial epicondyle. With cubitus valgus/varus, the
deformity is usually obvious. With cubitus valgus, it is important to
check the integrity of the ulnar nerve.

General Investigations

Hb ↓ anaemia of chronic disease, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. WCC ↑ septic
arthritis. ESR and CRP ↑ in infection/inflammatory disease.

[START_SECTION]Wrist
Causes
Traumatic
• Distal radial fracture, e.g. Colles’, Smith’s
• Scaphoid fracture
• Dislocations
• Carpal dislocations

Degenerative
• Osteoarthritis

Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis

Other
• Ganglion
• Tenosynovitis
• de Quervain’s
• Extensor tenosynovitis
• Carpal tunnel syndrome
• Avascular necrosis of the lunate (Kienböck’s disease)

History
Traumatic
The patient with a Colles’ fracture is usually an elderly osteoporotic
woman. There is a history of a fall on the outstretched hand (extended
wrist). The patient presents with pain and deformity. A Smith’s fracture
is the reverse of a Colles’ (fall onto flexed wrist). Again there is pain and

[START_SECTION]deformity. Dislocations of the carpus are rare, the most common being
dislocation of the lunate. This is usually due to a fall on the dorsiflexed
hand. There may be involvement of the median nerve. Fracture of the
scaphoid results from a fall on the outstretched hand or a blow to the
palm of the hand. The patient presents with a painful, swollen wrist.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis of the wrist is uncommon and usually a sequel to injury,
e.g. a fracture of the scaphoid. The patient complains of pain and
stiffness in the wrist.

Inflammatory
The wrist is commonly affected in rheumatoid arthritis. In the early
stages, there will be swelling, heat, pain and stiffness. Ultimately, ulnar
deviation of the wrist and palmar subluxation occur.

Other
A ganglion is a painless lump, usually on the dorsum of the wrist. de
Quervain’s tenosynovitis usually occurs in the middle-aged. It involves
the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. The patient
complains of pain on movement of the wrist and a weakness of the grip.
Extensor ‘tenosynovitis crepitans’ follows excess activity and may affect
all or only one of the extensor tendons. The patient usually complains of
pain and tenderness over the dorsum of the wrist occurring with
activity. With carpal tunnel syndrome there is often a history of
pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis,
anterior dislocation of the lunate or an arteriovenous fistula created for
dialysis. Middle-aged women are most affected with carpal tunnel
syndrome. There is pain in the distribution of the median nerve in the
hand, worse in bed at night. It is relieved by hanging the hand out of bed
and shaking the hand. The patient often complains of clumsiness with
fine movements due to median nerve involvement. With avascular

[START_SECTION]necrosis of the lunate, there may be a history of trauma. The patient is
usually a young adult who complains of ache and stiffness.

Examination
Traumatic
With a Colles’ fracture, there is a classical ‘dinner fork’ deformity. The
distal fragment is displaced backwards and radially. With Smith’s
fracture, there is forward angulation of the distal fragment. Pain,
limitation of movement and swelling occur. With dislocation, there is a
swollen wrist. Test the median nerve. Scaphoid fractures result in
swelling around the wrist, with localised tenderness in the anatomical
snuff box.

Degenerative
With osteoarthritis, the wrist may appear normal. There may be limited
painful movement with crepitus.

Inflammatory
With rheumatoid arthritis, there may be gross swelling with increased
local heat, pain and stiffness. Ultimately, ulnar deviation occurs and
there may be palmar subluxation with a significantly reduced
movement.

Other
A ganglion is a well-defined cystic non-tender lump which
transilluminates. With tenosynovitis, there is usually localised
tenderness and occasionally swelling. Often there is little else to find
except for a weak grip. Look for a precipitating cause for carpal tunnel
syndrome, e.g. pregnancy, hypothyroidism. The diagnosis is often made
on the history. There may be wasting of the thenar eminence and

[START_SECTION]sensory abnormalities in the distribution of the median nerve. Tinel’s
sign (percussion over the median nerve in the carpal tunnel causes
paraesthesia in the median nerve distribution) and Phalen’s sign
(paraesthesia following prolonged wrist flexion) may be positive. With
Kienböck’s disease, there will be localised tenderness and limited
dorsiflexion.

Hip

[START_SECTION]Causes
Congenital
• DDH (formerly congenital dislocation of the hip)

Acquired
Traumatic
• Fractured neck of femur
• Fracture of the pubic ramus
• Dislocation of the hip
• Acetabular fracture

Infective
• Acute pyogenic arthritis
• TB • (common in developing countries)

Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Reactive/Reiter’s syndrome
• Ankylosing spondylitis

Degenerative
• Osteoarthritis (Fig. 39)

• Avascular necrosis

Neoplastic
• Metastases
• Leukaemia in childhood

Other
• Transient synovitis
• Perthes’ disease
• Slipped upper femoral epiphysis

[START_SECTION]• Transient osteoporosis of the hip

History
Congenital
DDH is usually picked up on routine examination of the neonate with
Ortolani’s test and confirmed by US scan. If the diagnosis is missed on
routine testing, the child may present with a limp and waddling gait
(Trendelenburg gait). There is an increased risk of DDH if one parent
has a history of the disease and it is commoner with breech delivery,
primigravidas and female infants. Check for other congenital anomalies.

Acquired
Traumatic
Fracture of the neck of the femur usually occurs in an elderly female.
The trauma may be minor, e.g. tripping over the carpet. The patient
presents with pain in the hip, especially with movement and weightbearing is often impossible. In the young patient, there is usually a
history of major trauma. Dislocation of the hip, which is usually
posterior, is associated with other severe injuries. It often occurs with
road traffic accidents, the knee striking the dashboard. Pelvic fractures
(usually pubic rami) are usually a result of a fall in the elderly. The
patient feels deep-seated pain in the region of the hip. Walking is
painful. Acetabular fractures usually result from direct violence, e.g. a
fall on the side, or indirect, such as a fall on the feet or from impact of
the knee on a car dashboard.

Infective
The infection is usually blood-borne. It may occur in children where the
metaphysis is intracapsular, as in the hip. Check for a history of steroid

[START_SECTION]medication or other immunosuppression. The patient presents with a
hot, painful, tender joint. There is limitation of movement and weightbearing is painful. With TB, there is usually a history of contact. The
patient presents with malaise, weight loss and night sweats. There is
local pain and swelling with limitation of movement and local muscle
atrophy.

Inflammatory
Reactive/Reiter’s disease presents with a history of genitourinary or
gastrointestinal infection, urethritis and conjunctivitis. There may be a
history of sexual contact or dysentery. Rheumatoid arthritis usually
presents with a symmetrical small joint polyarthritis; however, the hip
may be involved. Ankylosing spondylitis may affect the hips. Spinal
stiffness is usually the presenting symptom.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis presents with pain and stiffness and the patient often has
difficulty walking. Secondary osteoarthritis may follow a history of
fractures, Perthes’ disease, slipped upper femoral epiphysis, avascular
necrosis, haemophilia. Avascular necrosis of the head of the femur may
occur following intracapsular fractures of the neck of the femur. It may
also occur in patients on steroid therapy.

Neoplastic
The upper end of the femur near the neck is a common site for
metastases. Hip pain in children may be due to leukaemic infiltration.

Other
Transient synovitis gives rise to an irritable hip with a limp, pain and
restriction of movement. Perthes’ usually occurs with a maximum
incidence around 7–8 years. There is pain in the hip and a limp. The
patient is otherwise well. The pain may be referred to the knee joint.
Slipped upper femoral epiphysis usually presents between 11 and 16

[START_SECTION]years. It occurs more commonly in boys. There is usually pain in the hip
and a limp and it may present with referred pain to the knee. Transient
osteoporosis of the hip may occur during pregnancy and is a selflimiting condition.

Examination
Congenital
Ortolani’s test is carried out after birth. The hips and knees are flexed to
a right angle and the thighs are abducted. There is a ‘clunk’ as the head
of the femur slips into the joint over the acetabulum (Ortolani’s test). In
Barlow’s test, the surgeon holds the upper femur between the middle
finger on the great trochanter and the thumb in the groin and levers the
femoral head in and out of the acetabulum, readily demonstrating
dislocation.

Acquired
Traumatic
The patient with a fractured neck of femur classically shows shortening,
adduction and external rotation of the leg. If the fracture is undisplaced,
limb alignment may be normal; however, movements are painful. With
dislocation, the patient is usually shocked with other injuries. With
posterior dislocation, the thigh is flexed, adducted and internally rotated.
Check for sciatic nerve injury. There may be associated injury to femur
or patella. With isolated fractures of the pubic ramus, there may be little
to find on examination, although a second fracture/joint injury is
common at the back of the pelvic ring.

Infective
Acute pyogenic arthritis presents with a hot, tender, painful swollen hip.
All movements are painful. There is spasm in the surrounding muscles.
The patient usually has a high fever. TB presents with local tenderness,

[START_SECTION]swelling and effusion. There is muscle wasting and spasm. There is
usually a constitutional upset with malaise and fever.

Inflammatory
With reactive/Reiter’s disease, there is usually associated urethritis and
conjunctivitis. With rheumatoid arthritis, other joints are usually
involved and the patient may describe constitutional symptoms. The hip
is often held in flexion and movements are painful. Ankylosing
spondylitis usually presents with a stiff spine with a limited range of
movement, although the hips may also be stiff.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis usually presents with a limp. The leg lies externally
rotated and appears shortened because of fixed adduction. There is
usually a degree of fixed flexion. Restriction in movement occurs:
abduction, extension and internal rotation loss occurring early and
being most restricted. There is apparent shortening. Avascular necrosis
results in distortion of joint shape with stiffness, limitation of movement
and ultimately secondary osteoarthritis.

Neoplastic
Check for localised pain over the hip joint. Check for any tumour of
breast, bronchus, thyroid, prostate or kidney. In children with leukaemic
infiltration, there may be other signs, e.g. spontaneous bruising,
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.

Other
Transient synovitis presents with a limp. There is no systemic upset.
There is limitation of movement at the joint. Perthes’ disease presents
with a limp and a decreased range of joint movement. With slipped
upper femoral epiphysis the leg lies in external rotation and passive
internal rotation is diminished. Limitation of movement due to pain is
usually present in transient osteoporosis of the hip.

• Chondromalacia patellae

History
Traumatic
With fractures around the knee joint, there will usually be an obvious
history of trauma. Fractures of the patella may arise because of violent
contraction of quadriceps or because of direct blows to the patella. With
ligamentous tears, there is often a history of damage during sport, e.g.
footballers. The patient will present with a painful, swollen knee joint.
Posterior cruciate ligament injury is usually due to a force drawing the
tibia backwards on the femur with the knee flexed, e.g. in a car accident
when the upper tibia strikes the dashboard. Meniscal tears often occur in
sportsmen when the knee is twisted while it is flexed. The patient
presents with a swollen knee with pain and tenderness on the side on
which the meniscus is torn. The knee may be ‘locked’, i.e. lacks the last
10–15° of extension. Very rapid swelling indicates bleeding into the
joint, and hence fracture or cruciate damage or peripheral meniscal
detachment.

Infective

[START_SECTION]Infective
Usually blood-borne. More common in children. May occur in adults on
steroids or who are immunosuppressed. The patient presents with a hot,
painful, tender joint with malaise and fever. The patient is reluctant to
move the joint.

Inflammatory
In rheumatoid arthritis, the patient complains of pain, swelling and
stiffness together with constitutional upset. Symptoms of rheumatoid
arthritis may be present elsewhere. Reactive/Reiter’s syndrome may
present with swelling and discomfort in the knee. There is often a
history of urethritis, conjunctivitis or dysentery. Ankylosing spondylitis
may present with knee joint involvement. Usually the patient also
complains of stiffness of the spine.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis is common in the knee. The patient may be overweight
and elderly. There is pain on movement, stiffness and deformity. There
may be a history of previous joint pathology, e.g. septic arthritis,
meniscal tear, meniscal surgery or osteochondritis dissecans.

Metabolic
Gout may present with pain and swelling of the knee. Pseudogout
(pyrophosphate deposition disease) may also present in the knee joint.
The condition is associated with chondrocalcinosis, i.e. there is
calcification visible in hyaline and fibrocartilage.

Neuropathic
The patient presents with a painless joint, which is grossly deformed
and hypermobile. There may be a history of diabetes, syphilis or
leprosy.

[START_SECTION]Neoplastic
The lower end of the femur and the upper end of the tibia are common
sites of osteogenic sarcoma. The patient is usually male and under the
age of 30 years. There is pain, swelling and deformity around the knee.
The patient may also complain of cough due to lung metastases.

Other
Bursitis
Bursitis presents with swelling, either in front of or behind the knee. The
swelling may be painless. Patients who work on their knees leaning
forwards, e.g. carpet fitters, may get prepatellar bursitis (housemaid’s
knee). Infrapatellar bursitis occurs in those who sit back on their heels
(e.g. vicars praying, hence the name clergyman’s knee). A semimembranosus bursa presents behind the knee on the medial side. A
bursa may become infected, in which case the patient will present with a
tender, red, hot swelling.

Baker’s cyst
Baker’s cyst presents in the midline of the popliteal fossa. The patient
will notice a lump and reduced flexion of the knee. There may also be
pain associated with concurrent osteoarthritis of the joint.

Disorders of alignment
With genu varum, the patient presents with bow legs. In children, this is
usually associated with a disorder of growth, often with a bony injury to
the area of epiphyses. In adults, there may be a history of rickets, Paget’s
disease, rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. In genu valgum (knock knee), the
patient is often a child who has flat feet. In adults, there may be a history
of rheumatoid arthritis.

Patellofemoral instability
Dislocation of the patella may occur. In the acute form, there may be a

[START_SECTION]history of a blow to one side of the knee. Recurrent dislocation of the
patella affects adolescent girls. It is usually associated with flattening of
the lateral condyle, a high-riding patella (patella alta) or genu valgum.

Referred pain
It is very common for pain to be referred from the hip or the back to the
knee. Always enquire about hip and back symptoms.

Osteochondritis dissecans
This occurs most commonly in the second decade of life. A segment of
bone undergoes avascular necrosis, separates and forms a loose body in
the joint. The patient complains of pain, swelling and intermittent
‘locking’ of the joint.

Osgood–Schlatter’s disease
The patient is usually a boy aged between 10 and 14 years. There is a
history of physical activity, e.g. football. Pain and swelling occur,
accurately located to the area of the tibial tuberosity.

Chondromalacia patellae
The patient presents with ill-localised pain in front of the knee. It is most
common in females in the 15–35 years age group. There may be a
history of injury. There is usually some swelling, and pain occurs,
especially when climbing stairs. The knee tends to give way.

Examination
Traumatic
Fractures will usually be obvious. There will be pain, tenderness,
deformity and crepitus. With supracondylar fractures, it is important to
check the distal circulation. With ligamentous injuries, test for joint
stability, effusion and tenderness over the affected ligament. Testing for
active straight-leg raising will exclude injury to the extensor mechanism

[START_SECTION](rupture of quadriceps, rupture of patellar tendon, patellar fracture).
Valgus and varus strain testing may be necessary to diagnose
ligamentous injury. Test for anterior and posterior drawer signs and
carry out Lachman’s test. With meniscal injuries, there is tenderness,
swelling and effusion in the acute phase. The joint may be locked, i.e.
loss of the last 10–15° of extension. In the chronic phase, there will be
wasted quadriceps, effusion, tenderness over the meniscus in the joint
line. McMurray’s test will be positive with medial meniscus injury,
although it is rarely carried out these days.
In acute knee injuries, little examination can be performed at the time
due to pain and re-assessment at 10 days is appropriate.

Infective
The patient will be febrile, with a hot, red, tender, painful, swollen joint.
There will be spasm in the surrounding muscles and no active or passive
movement will be possible (occasionally, movements are possible in
diabetics and patients on steroids and immunosuppressive drugs).

Inflammatory
With rheumatoid arthritis, there will be fever, pain and swelling with
decreased range of movement and synovial thickening. There will often
be signs of rheumatoid arthritis in other joints. With reactive/Reiter’s
syndrome, there will be swelling and reduced movements. Urethritis
and conjunctivitis may be apparent. Ankylosing spondylitis may affect
the knee joints, in which case there will be swelling and stiffness. There
is usually reduced movement of the spine.

Degenerative
With osteoarthritis, there will be swelling due to osteophytes, and
possibly thickened synovium or effusion. There will be wasting of
quadriceps, reduced mobility of the joint and gait is invariably
disturbed. Alignment may be distorted if only one side of the joint is

[START_SECTION]affected.

Metabolic
With gout, the joint is red, hot and swollen and there is limitation of
movement. A similar appearance occurs in pseudogout.

Neuropathic
The joint will be grossly swollen and deformed. There will be abnormal
mobility which is painless. Test for abnormality of dorsal column
sensation (joint position sense).

Other
Bursitis – soft, fluctuant swelling in front of the patella (prepatellar
bursitis) or below the patella (infrapatellar bursitis). Semi-membranosus
bursitis presents as a cystic swelling on the medial aspect of the
popliteal fossa. If the bursa becomes infected, then the swelling becomes
hot, red and tender. With osteochondritis dissecans, there will be joint
swelling due to effusion, and intermittent locking of the joint. Genu
valgum and genu varum will be apparent on examination.
Patellofemoral instability may result from acute or chronic dislocation.
With acute dislocation, the patella is visibly displaced laterally with the
knee flexed. There will be localised tenderness and swelling. With
chronic dislocation, the knee locks in semiflexion. Spontaneous
reduction often occurs. The patella may feel too high or too small. With
Osgood–Schlatter’s disease, there is tenderness and swelling over the
tibial tuberosity. With chondromalacia patellae, there is slight swelling
and pain when the patella is rocked against the femur. Always
remember to examine the hip joint and spine as pain may be referred.
Baker’s cyst is a soft, diffuse swelling in the popliteal fossa. Pain occurs
if the cyst ruptures and can mimic a DVT.

[START_SECTION]Ankle
Causes
Traumatic
• Sprains (lateral ligaments)
• Fractures around the ankle
• Rupture of the Achilles tendon

Infective
• Pyogenic arthritis
• TB

Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis

Degenerative
• Osteoarthritis

Others
• Tenosynovitis
• Footballer’s ankle
• Tarsal tunnel syndrome
• Osteochondritis of the talus

History
Traumatic
History of recent injury. Sprains usually affect the lateral ligament. With
fractures, there will be swelling, deformity, bruising and crepitus
around the ankle. With tibiofibular diastasis, there may be a high fibular
fracture. Rupture of the Achilles tendon often occurs during sport

[START_SECTION](occasionally in bed!), particularly in middle-aged men. Patients feel as
though they have been kicked in the back of the heel.

Infective
Pyogenic arthritis will result in a red, hot, tender joint. Tuberculous
arthritis is rare. There will be pain on walking. There is usually a
history of TB elsewhere.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis is the commonest cause of chronic pain and
swelling at the ankle joint. There will invariably be other symptoms of
rheumatoid arthritis. Fever and malaise may also be present.

Degenerative
Primary osteoarthritis of the ankle is rare. Osteoarthritis is often a
sequel to an imperfectly reduced fracture or avascular necrosis of the
talus. Symptoms are often mild.

Others
Tenosynovitis may occur in the tendons behind either the lateral or
medial malleolus. Pain is present on either side of the ankle, particularly
during inversion or eversion. Footballer’s ankle, as the name implies,
occurs in those who play football. The patient presents with poorly
localised pain in front of the ankle. Osteochondritis of the talus is rare. It
occurs in teenagers and young men. There is often severe pain in the
ankle. In tarsal tunnel syndrome, the tibial nerve may be compressed as
it passes beneath the flexor retinaculum, giving rise to paraesthesia and
a burning pain in the medial aspect of the sole of the foot and toes.

Examination

[START_SECTION]Traumatic
In fractures, there will be deformity, a palpable swelling, tenderness and
crepitus. With ruptures of the Achilles tendon, there is usually an
obvious gap in the Achilles tendon, and a weakness of plantar flexion of
the foot against resistance. Apply the Thomson squeeze test. Normally,
when the calf is squeezed, the foot plantar flexes. This does not occur
with rupture of the Achilles tendon.

Infective
In pyogenic arthritis, there will be a hot, tender, swollen, painful ankle.
With TB, the ankle will be swollen, with wasting of calf muscles.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis seldom affects the ankle only. It presents with a
swollen, tender ankle but there will be signs of arthritis elsewhere.

Degenerative
In osteoarthritis, there is swelling, with a decreased range of movements
of the ankle with crepitus.

Others
With tenosynovitis, there is a puffy swelling and tenderness along the
tendons. There may be pain on forced eversion (peroneus longus) and
inversion (tibialis posterior). With footballer’s ankle, there is tearing of
the anterior capsule of the joint with subsequent calcification.
Examination often reveals restriction in dorsiflexion. With
osteochondritis of the talus, there is ankle swelling and tenderness.
Loose bodies may present in the joint.

General Investigations

[START_SECTION]■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ anaemia of chronic disease, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. WCC ↑
infection, e.g. pyogenic arthritis. ESR and CRP ↑ infection/inflammatory
disease.
■ Ankle X-ray

• Septic arthritis is an emergency. Immediate assessment and
management is required in order to avert long-term joint
damage.
• New onset inflammatory arthritis dictates rapid referral to a
specialist, as early intensive intervention has been shown to
markedly improve prognosis.

[START_SECTION]Kidney Swellings
Kidney swellings are not uncommon. They may present silently or may
be associated with haematuria, urinary tract infections and pyrexia.

Causes
Congenital
• Polycystic kidney

Acquired
Infective
• Perinephric abscess
• TB • (common where TB is endemic)

Obstructive
• Hydronephrosis
• Pyonephrosis

Degenerative
• Solitary cyst

Neoplastic
• Hypernephroma (Fig. 40)
• Nephroblastoma

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 40 Abdominal CT scan.
A large renal cell carcinoma (hypernephroma) of the right kidney can be
seen (arrow).

History
Congenital
There will often be a family history with adult polycystic kidney
disease; however, it does not usually present until the third or fourth
decade, when the patient may present with an abdominal mass,
haematuria, loin pain (infection or bleeding into a cyst) or chronic renal
failure. Hypertension may be a presenting symptom. Rarely,
hydronephrosis may present at birth. Hydronephrosis in infants may be
a cause of failure to thrive.

Acquired
There may be a history of TB. The patient may present with haematuria,
dysuria or pyuria. With perinephric abscess, there may be a history of
diabetes. Nephroblastoma presents with an abdominal mass, pain,
haematuria, pyrexia and weight loss within the first three years of life.

Examination
A mass may be palpated in either the right or the left loin. This moves
with respiration and is palpable bimanually and ballotable. Generally, a
kidney swelling is dull to percussion, but there may be a strip of

[START_SECTION]resonance across the swelling due to the gas-filled overlying transverse
colon. A solitary cyst may be large, tense and smooth. Polycystic
kidneys may be very large and extend down to the groin. They are
smooth and embossed with many cysts. They may be tender if the cysts
are infected or tense following bleeding. Hydronephrotic kidneys may
be very large, smooth and tense. Perinephric abscesses may be
associated with redness, swelling and oedema in the loin. Occasionally,
they may point in the loin, but this is rare nowadays. Hypernephromas
are usually firm, irregular, nodular, and may be fixed. A
nephroblastoma presents with a large mass in the loin and abdomen.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↑ (hypernephroma may be associated with polycythaemia). Hb ↓
blood loss due to haematuria. WCC ↑ pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess.
ESR ↑ hypernephroma, nephroblastoma, TB, infection.

there may be a past history of deaths in the family from
chronic renal failure.

[START_SECTION]Leg Pain
This section deals with causes of pain arising from local lesions within
the leg, or referred into the leg. Pain in the leg is a common complaint
and the majority of cases are of vascular or orthopaedic origin. Joint
problems are dealt with in the section on Joint disorders (p. 267).

Causes
Traumatic
• Fractures
• Dislocations
• Crush injuries

Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Reiter’s disease
• Ankylosing spondylitis

Infective
• Cellulitis
• Septic arthritis
• Myositis
• Osteomyelitis

Degenerative
• Osteoarthritis
• Meniscal lesions
• Baker’s cyst

[START_SECTION]Vascular
• Intermittent claudication
• Deep venous thrombosis
• Acute arterial occlusion

Neurological
• Sciatica
• Peripheral neuropathy
• Neurogenic claudication

Metabolic
• Gout

Neoplastic
• Osteogenic sarcoma
• Secondary deposits

Other
• Cramp
• Polymyalgia rheumatica
• Strenuous exercise

History
Traumatic
Obvious history of trauma.

Inflammatory
History of joint swelling, stiffness, limitation of movement. Pain on
walking. There may be an obvious history of rheumatoid arthritis with
signs elsewhere, e.g. the hands. Reiter’s disease – conjunctivitis,

[START_SECTION]urethritis. Ankylosing spondylitis – stiffness of the spine, especially in
the morning; hip and knee involvement.

Infective
Cellulitis may arise from puncture wounds, e.g. insect bites or in a
lymphoedematous leg. The patient presents with pain, redness,
tenderness, malaise and fever. Myositis may occur in association with
collagen diseases, e.g. scleroderma, dermatomyositis. Osteomyelitis is
rare but more common in childhood. History of immunosuppression or
diabetes. Recent history of infection elsewhere. Pain aggravated by
movement. Swelling and redness of the affected area. Septic arthritis
presents with a red, hot, tender, painful joint. More common in children.
In adults, enquire about a history of steroid therapy or diabetes.

Degenerative
Osteoarthritis presents with pain, stiffness and deformity. The pain is
often worse on starting walking and then improves. Baker’s cyst
presents with a lump behind the knee. The patient may complain of pain
and swelling of the calf if the cyst ruptures. With meniscal lesions, there
is usually a history of twisting the knee, e.g. playing football. The knee
may lock.

Vascular
Deep venous thrombosis presents with painful swelling of the leg. There
may be a history of the contraceptive pill, prolonged immobilisation,
recent surgery, malignancy. Acute arterial occlusion results in sudden
onset of severe pain in the affected limb. The patient is unable to move
the leg and complains that the leg feels cold. With intermittent
claudication, there is pain on walking, relieved by rest. It may affect the
calf, thigh or buttock. Rest pain in the foot may occur with advanced
arterial disease. The pain is often worse in bed at night and the patient
obtains relief by hanging the foot out of bed.

[START_SECTION]Neurological
Pain down the back of the leg (sciatica) often made worse by coughing,
movement or straining. The patient may also complain of backache with
painful spasm in the back muscles. There are restricted movements of
the spine. Neurogenic claudication results from central spinal canal
stenosis. Symptoms improve with flexion, as this increases the diameter
of the canal. Therefore, patients find it easier to cycle than walk and
easier to walk upstairs than downstairs. With neurogenic claudication,
the claudication distance becomes progressively shorter with each bout
of pain during one walk but not with vascular claudication. It also takes
the pain of neurogenic claudication longer to settle than the pain of
vascular claudication. The two forms of claudication may co-exist,
making diagnosis difficult.

Metabolic
Gout presents as acute severe pain with redness and swelling of a joint.
There may be a history of previous episodes. History of trauma, surgery,
infection, diuretics, polycythaemia, leukaemia, cytotoxic therapy or
immunosuppressive therapy.

Neoplastic
Osteogenic sarcoma usually presents in men between 20 and 40 years
old. There is usually swelling around the knee, the commonest sites of
the tumour being the lower femur or upper tibia. The patient often
complains of bone pain, swelling or cough due to lung secondaries. Pain
or pathological fractures may be due to secondary deposits. These may
occur from the breast, lung, thyroid, prostate or kidney. Check for
symptoms related to these or previous surgery for malignancy.

Other
Polymyalgia rheumatica usually occurs in elderly women. There is

[START_SECTION]aching, morning stiffness in proximal muscles and often associated
arthritis. Cramp is painful muscle spasm. The patient often complains of
severe pain in the legs, especially at night or after exercise. It may occur
with salt depletion, myopathy or muscle ischaemia. It is common in
chronic renal failure.

Examination
Traumatic
Pain, loss of function, tenderness, deformity, crepitus, abnormal
mobility. Check for associated nerve and vascular injuries.

Inflammatory
Pain in joints, swelling, tenderness, loss of movement, fixed deformities,
disturbances of gait. Signs of rheumatoid arthritis elsewhere. Reiter’s
disease – conjunctivitis, urethritis. Ankylosing spondylitis – stiffness of
the spine, reduced thoracic excursion, fixed kyphotic spine,
hyperextended neck.

Infective
In acute cellulitis, there is redness and tenderness over the affected area.
Inguinal lymphadenopathy may be present. With acute osteomyelitis,
there is tenderness and heat over the site of infection. With myositis,
there is tenderness and wasting of the muscles. There may be other signs
of collagen diseases, e.g. polyarteritis nodosa, SLE, scleroderma or
dermatomyositis. In septic arthritis, there is a hot, tender, painful,
swollen joint and all movements are painful. Surrounding muscle spasm
is present.

Degenerative
In osteoarthritis, there is deformity, synovial thickening, bony

[START_SECTION]enlargement due to osteophytes, effusion, loss of movement and fixed
deformities. Baker’s cyst presents as a swelling in the popliteal fossa. If
it has ruptured there is pain and swelling of the calf. Meniscal lesions
present with swelling of the knee and tenderness over the joint line in the
early phase. Later, there may be a continued effusion with wasted
quadriceps and a positive McMurray sign.

Vascular
Deep vein thrombosis presents with pain, tenderness, swelling and heat,
usually over the calf. There is ankle oedema. With iliofemoral
thrombosis, there may be phlegmasia alba dolens (white leg) or
phlegmasia cerulea dolens (painful blue leg). Acute ischaemia presents
with the five Ps: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paraesthesia and paralysis.
Check for atrial fibrillation. With intermittent claudication, examine for
absent pulses. Buerger’s test.

Neoplastic
There is usually a hot, tender swelling around the knee joint in either the
lower femur or upper tibia. Examine the chest for lung metastases. With
secondary deposits, check the lung, breast, thyroid, prostate and kidney.

Neurological
Lordosis, limited straight leg raising, restricted back movements.
Reduced reflexes in the lower limb. Areas of absent sensation.

Metabolic
With gout, there will be a tender, red, swollen joints with limitation of
movement. Check for gouty tophi elsewhere.

Other

[START_SECTION]Polymyalgia rheumatica presents with tenderness over muscles and
arthritis. Occasionally there is associated giant cell arteritis.
Examine the temporal artery for tenderness. With cramp, there may be
signs of chronic renal failure.

• Always carefully examine the pulses. Vascular disease in
the lower limbs is a common condition.
• Acute ischaemia presents with the five Ps (see above).
Treatment is urgent.
• Vague swelling and thickening around the knee joint in 20–
40 year olds may be due to osteogenic sarcoma. Refer for Xray.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Leg Swellings
Swelling of the lower limb may be unilateral or bilateral. Bilateral
swellings are usually due to medical conditions such as cardiac, renal or
hepatic failure. Unilateral swellings are commonly due to trauma,
venous disease or lymphatic disease.

Causes
Local
Acute Swelling
• Trauma
• DVT (Fig. 42)
• Cellulitis
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Allergy

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 42 Phlegmasia cerulea dolens.
The painful, swollen, blue leg results from a massive ilio-femoral venous
thrombosis. It may lead to venous gangrene unless the resulting high
tissue pressure is relieved by thrombectomy. In this patient, blood-filled
blisters and gangrene of the toes have already developed. This is a
relatively rare presentation of deep vein thrombosis.

Chronic Swelling
• Venous
• Varicose veins
• Obstruction to venous return, e.g. pregnancy, pelvic
tumours, IVC obstruction, post-phlebitic limb
• Dependency
• Lymphoedema
• Congenital malformations, e.g. arteriovenous fistulae
• Paralysis (failure of muscle pump)

General
• Congestive cardiac failure
• Hypoproteinaemia, e.g. liver failure, nephrotic syndrome,
malnutrition
• Renal failure
• Fluid overload

[START_SECTION]• Myxoedema

History
Bilateral leg swelling is usually due to systemic conditions, e.g. cardiac
failure, while unilateral leg swelling is more often due to local causes,
e.g. DVT, cellulitis. Pain will be associated with trauma, DVT, infection
or complications of varicose veins. Other causes of swelling of the lower
limb may be painless, although the limb may be uncomfortable if the
oedema becomes tense. Evidence of the following should be sought in
the past medical history: trauma to the limb, recent pregnancy (DVT),
abdominal or pelvic malignancy, previous surgery or radiotherapy to
lymph nodes, thyroid disease, congestive cardiac failure, renal failure,
liver failure, malnutrition, poliomyelitis in childhood, nerve lesions.
With primary lymphoedema, the leg may have been swollen since birth
or oedema may have developed at puberty (lymphoedema praecox) or in
the third decade (lymphoedema tarda).

Examination
The presence of fracture, contusion or haematoma should be obvious.
With cellulitis, the limb will be red, swollen, hot and tender. A puncture
wound may be visible. DVT may be suspected if the limb is tender and
swollen, particularly the calf, with a positive Homans’ sign, i.e. pain in
the calf on dorsiflexion of the foot. Tenderness may be present over the
femoral vein with femoral vein thrombosis. The limb may be pale and
swollen to the groin (phlegmasia alba dolens) or tense and purplish and
extremely painful (phlegmasia cerulea dolens) with iliofemoral
thrombosis. Bilateral swelling with dilated collateral veins on the
abdominal wall suggests IVC thrombosis. Swelling and tenderness over
the joints may suggest rheumatoid arthritis. Lymphoedema pits in the
early stages but in the later stage, it becomes non-pitting, when the skin
and subcutaneous tissue become thick and eventually hyperkeratotic

[START_SECTION]and warty. Previous scars in the groin, a mass of malignant nodes or
signs of previous radiotherapy will suggest lymphoedema as a possible
cause.
In the presence of an arteriovenous fistula, there will be dilated veins
which do not collapse on elevation of the limb. The limb will be warmer
than the opposite limb; palpation will reveal a thrill and auscultation
will reveal a continuous machinery bruit.
Localised swelling of the limb may be due to a tumour. There may
also be associated distal swelling due to venous or lymphatic
obstruction.
Swelling due to neurological damage, e.g. nerve lesions or
poliomyelitis, will result in wasting, which should be apparent.
Examination of the abdomen may reveal hepatomegaly or an abdominal
mass, which could obstruct the venous outflow. It is appropriate to carry
out a rectal examination for a pelvic tumour, which may be causing
back pressure on the venous and lymphatic system or may have resulted
in a ‘frozen’ pelvis.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
A large haematoma associated with trauma or fracture may result in a
low Hb. WCC ↑ will suggest infection. Haematoma may be associated
with a reduced platelet count.
■ Urinalysis
Proteinuria may suggest a renal cause.
■ U&Es and creatinine
Raised urea and creatinine will be associated with renal failure.
■ LFTs
May indicate impaired liver function with associated
hypoalbuminaemia.
■ Blood glucose
Cellulitis or other infections of the leg may be associated with diabetes.
■ CXR

[START_SECTION]Findings suggestive of cardiac failure are cardiomegaly, pulmonary
oedema and pleural effusions. Pulmonary oedema may be associated
with fluid overload associated with renal failure. Secondary deposits
may be seen in association with sarcoma of the limb.
■ Limb X-ray
May show fracture, tumour or gas in the tissues associated with gas
gangrene.

Specific Investigations
■ Clotting screen
There may be abnormal clotting associated with coagulopathy,
resulting in spontaneous haematoma.
■ TFTs
Myxoedema
■ US
Haematoma or soft-tissue sarcoma.
■ CT
Haematoma or tumour.
■ MRI
Soft-tissue sarcoma.
■ US or CT pelvis
May show an abdominal or pelvic mass causing extrinsic pressure on
the veins.
■ Duplex Doppler
Will show DVT or arteriovenous fistula.
■ Venography
Will confirm DVT.
■ Arteriography
Will confirm the presence of an arteriovenous fistula.
■ Lymphangiography
May demonstrate the cause of lymphoedema, e.g. hypoplasia or
obstruction.
■ Lymph node biopsy

[START_SECTION]Infection or tumour.
• Patients with unexplained DVT may have underlying
malignancy. Take a full systematic history.
• In the young patient with unilateral oedema of slow onset,
always consider lymphoedema. Lymphoedema does not pit.

[START_SECTION]Leg Ulcers
An ulcer is a discontinuity of an epithelial surface. Leg ulcers are
common and the site of an ulcer on the leg may provide a clue to its
aetiology.

Causes
Infective
• Syphilis
• TB • (common where TB is endemic)

Neoplastic
• Squamous cell carcinoma
• Malignant melanoma
• Basal cell carcinoma

Vascular
• Venous stasis ulcers (Fig. 43)
• Arterial (ischaemic) ulcers
• Arteriovenous fistulae

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 43 Venous stasis ulcer.
The ulcer is in a characteristic position on the distal medial aspect of the
lower limb.

Neuropathic
• Diabetes
• Leprosy
• Tabes dorsalis (syphilis)

Autoimmune/Vasculitic
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• SLE

Haematological
• Sickle cell anaemia
• Polycythaemia rubra vera
• Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

Other
• Dermatitis artefacta (self-inflicted)
• Pyoderma gangrenosum

History
A history of trauma may be apparent. In self-inflicted injury, it may not.
Pain suggests trauma, ischaemia or infection. Lack of pain suggests a
neuropathic cause, e.g. diabetes mellitus or tabes dorsalis. A history of
varicose veins or DVT suggests a venous stasis ulcer. A prior history of
intermittent claudication suggests ischaemic ulcers, as does a history of
atrial fibrillation or subacute bacterial endocarditis (embolic). The

[START_SECTION]presence of a longstanding venous ulcer with recent change in the shape
of the ulcer suggests development of a squamous cell carcinoma
(Marjolin’s ulcer).
A history of rheumatoid arthritis or collagen disease may suggest a
vasculitic lesion. A pigmented ulcerating lesion arising at the site of a
previous mole or de novo may suggest a malignant melanoma,
especially if there is a history of prolonged exposure to the sun or
sunburn. A history of any haematological conditions should be sought.
Pyoderma gangrenosum may occur in association with Crohn’s disease
or ulcerative colitis.

Examination
Site
The site of an ulcer may give a clue to the aetiology. Venous stasis ulcers
usually occur on the medial aspect of the lower third of the leg, usually
over the medial malleolus. Arterial ulcers occur over the metatarsal
heads, tips of the toes, lateral aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal,
around the heel, in between the toes and on the tips of the toes. Diabetic
ischaemic ulcers occur at the same sites. Diabetic neuropathic ulcers
usually occur at pressure points, e.g. under the heel, under the heads of
the first and fifth metatarsals and under the toes. They are often
associated with callosities.

Edge
Classically, five types are described. A sloping edge suggests a healing
ulcer, e.g. venous stasis ulcer. A punched-out edge suggests an
ischaemic ulcer or a syphilitic gummatous ulcer (rare). An undermined
edge suggests a tuberculous ulcer (rare). A rolled edge is characteristic
of a rodent ulcer, while an everted edge is suggestive of a malignant
ulcer, e.g. squamous cell carcinoma.

[START_SECTION]Base
This may contain slough or granulation tissue. Ischaemic ulcers may
contain no granulation tissue but have black necrotic tissue, or tendon or
bone visible in the base. Syphilitic ulcers have a classical appearance of
slough in the base, which resembles a wash leather.

Surrounding tissues
Is the surrounding skin pink and healthy with normal innervation? Are
there black satellite lesions associated with malignant melanoma?
Examine the regional lymph nodes for sites of secondary infection or
metastases. Examine for varicose veins, changes following DVT or the
absence of pulses and the presence of bruits. Examine the whole patient,
e.g. signs of rheumatoid arthritis.
Remember that, although the initial lesion may have been caused by
trauma, other abnormalities may be present to prevent healing, e.g. poor
circulation, malnutrition or steroid therapy. Ulcers over the shin in
elderly women with thin skin may have been due to minor trauma.
However, the fact that the skin there is poorly supported on the
periosteum of the underlying bone means that they may be extremely
slow to heal. Ulcers occurring in inflammatory bowel disease may be
due to pyoderma gangrenosum. The ulcers may be multiple and may
have started as pustules.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ suggests haematological disease. WCC ↑ infection. ESR ↑ collagen
diseases (vasculitis), syphilis, TB.

■ Antibody screen
e.g. ANCA (SLE).
■ VDRL
Syphilis.
■ Doppler studies
Venous disease. Arterial disease.
■ Biopsy
Incision biopsy for possible squamous cell carcinoma or diagnosis of
the cause of an obscure ulcer. Excision biopsy is required for suspected
malignant melanoma.
■ Venography
Assess varicose veins. Deep venous patency.
■ Arteriography
Assess arterial tree.
• Always carefully describe the ulcer in the notes, especially
the edge. Rolled everted edges suggest malignancy.
• Deep ulcers punched out with tendon or periosteum in the
base suggest an arterial aetiology.
• Painful ulcers usually have an arterial aetiology.
• Neoplastic change may occur in an existing benign ulcer
(Marjolin’s ulcer). This is rare.

[START_SECTION]Lip Lesions
Lip lesions are common. They may be extremely painful and interfere
with speech and feeding. They may be socially embarrassing for the
patient. They may also prevent appropriate contact with a partner,
leading to emotional problems. In the elderly, carcinoma is a common
cause of a lump on the lip, especially in those with outdoor occupations.

Causes
Congenital
• Cleft lip (hare lip)

Acquired
Flat Lesions
• Junctional naevus
• Peutz–Jeghers syndrome
• Telangiectasia (hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia)

Raised Lesions
• Mucous retention cysts
• Warts
• Pyogenic granuloma
• Squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 44)
• Malignant melanoma
• Syphilitic chancre
• Vascular malformations

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 44 A squamous cell carcinoma on the lower lip.
The patient, a man of 60, had smoked a pipe for most of his life. He
presented with a non-healing ulcer of the lip, which proved to be a welldifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma on biopsy.

Erosions
• Herpes simplex
• Impetigo
• Pemphigus

Swelling
• Trauma, e.g. burns, bites, assault
• Angioneurotic oedema
• Drug reactions
• Crohn’s disease

Cheilitis
• Infection, e.g. candidiasis
• Contact dermatitis, e.g. lipstick, pen-sucking
• Lip-licking (especially in children)

History
Congenital
Cleft lip occurs due to failure of fusion of the nasal and maxillary

[START_SECTION]processes which form the upper lip and the maxilla. The only
abnormality may be a slight indentation in the outer part of the middle
third of the upper lip. However, it may extend to the anterior nares. It
may be associated with a cleft palate. The condition may be unilateral or
bilateral. Abnormal phonation occurs.

Acquired
Flat lesions
Junctional naevi develop at or before puberty. Ensure that there has been
no change in a junctional naevus to suggest development of malignant
melanoma. In Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, pigmentation will be on the
gums as well as the lips. There will usually be a family history
(autosomal dominant). These pigmented lip lesions do not become
malignant. There may be associated history of bowel problems, e.g.
bleeding or intussusception. In hereditary telangiectasia, the patient may
also have noticed lesions in the mouth and on the skin, especially the
fingertips.

Raised lesions
Mucous retention cysts may occur at any age. The patient complains of
a lump on the inner aspect of the lip, which interferes with eating. With
warts, pyogenic granuloma and squamous cell carcinoma, the patient’s
only complaint is usually of a lump on the lip. With carcinoma, there
may be a history of leucoplakia, betelnut chewing or pipe smoking.
Classically, it used to relate to clay-pipe smoking. There may also be a
history of exposure to sunlight, and carcinoma is common in outdoor
workers, e.g. sailors, farmers, fisherman and fair-skinned people in
sunny climates. Ulcerating and bleeding of the lesion may be a
presenting complaint. Syphilitic lesions are now extremely rare. A
primary chancre may present on the lip. They are highly contagious. A
gummatous lesion on the lip is extremely rare. Malignant melanoma
may present as a black, ulcerating or raised lesion at the site of a
junctional naevus.

[START_SECTION]Erosions
The commonest are herpes simplex lesions. Small painful ulcers, which
itch, may be present on the lips. They are common in
immunocompromised patients. Impetigo is common around the mouth
and face of children but may affect any age. Pemphigus is a blistering
disorder, which affects the mucosa and skin.

Swelling
Swelling of the lips may be due to a variety of causes. Trauma is
probably the most common, usually following assault, but may arise as
a result of burns (hot fluids), sun rays or angioneurotic oedema, which is
rare and may affect the tongue and other parts of the body. Drug
reactions may cause oedema when associated with urticaria. They
usually affect the whole face rather than just the lips. Crohn’s disease
may also cause swelling of the lips. Other symptoms and signs of
Crohn’s disease, e.g. diarrhoea, abdominal pain or perianal sepsis, may
be present.

Cheilitis
This usually refers to inflammation of the lips and may occur at the
angles of the mouth, i.e. angular cheilitis or angular stomatitis. Contact
dermatitis may be apparent from either lipstick or pen-sucking. A
history of lip-licking should be sought, especially in children. Candida
may cause cheilitis in the immunocompromised, infants, those with
dentures and those with iron-deficiency anaemia.

Examination
Congenital
Cleft lip is obvious at birth. Cleft palate is discovered on routine
inspection soon after birth or may be discovered when difficulties occur
with feeding. Beware missing a submucous cleft in which the palate
initially appears intact. Late presentation may occur with speech and

[START_SECTION]hearing difficulties.

Acquired
Flat lesions
Junctional naevi are flat, pigmented lesions. The lesions of Peutz–
Jeghers syndrome are also flat lesions but, in addition to occurring on
the lips, occur also on the gums. In hereditary telangiectasia,
telangiectasia may also be present in the mouth, on the palate and on the
skin, especially the fingertips.

Raised lesions
Mucous retention cysts tend to occur on the inner aspects of the lips.
They are generally pale pink with a grey glairy appearance when the
cyst contents show through the stretched overlying mucosa. They are
usually smooth, well localised and rarely get bigger than 2 cm in
diameter. A warty lesion is usually obvious, with a rough
hyperkeratotic surface. Warts may be pedunculated. A pyogenic
granuloma is a firm, small, cherry-red nodule consisting of hyperplastic
granulation tissue. A squamous cell carcinoma is usually a hard
ulcerated lesion with a raised everted edge. The regional lymph nodes
may be palpable due to metastases. Malignant melanoma may arise de
novo or in a pre-existing junctional naevus. The lesion is usually raised,
pigmented, occasionally friable and bleeds easily. There may be satellite
nodules and regional nodes may be palpable due to metastases.
Syphilitic lesions are rare nowadays. A chancre associated with primary
syphilis may occur on the lips. The initial lesion is elevated, flat, hard
and painless. Eventually, however, ulceration may occur, to give a
slightly painful ulcer which crusts over. The regional lymph nodes
become enlarged and tender, usually 7–10 days after the appearance of
the chancre.

Erosions

[START_SECTION]Herpetic lesions begin as a patch of painful, itchy erythema. Vesicles
form subsequently, which dry up and crust over after 4–5 days, the crust
eventually separating, leaving tiny scars. Impetigo causes goldencoloured crusts, usually on the faces of children. In pemphigus, blisters
erode quickly and become painful erosions on the mucous membrane
and skin.

Swellings and cheilitis
These are usually diagnosed from the history. They usually cause
reddening and inflammation of the lips.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ iron-deficiency anaemia (associated with cheilitis). WCC ↑
infection. WCC ↓ immunosuppression. ESR ↑ Crohn’s disease, syphilis,
malignancy.
■ Swab

■ Colonoscopy

[START_SECTION]Peutz–Jeghers syndrome. Mucosal lesions.
• Ulcers on the lips in the elderly are likely to be malignant.
Biopsy is indicated.
• Recurrent herpetic lesions suggest an immunosuppressed
state. Further investigation is necessary.

[START_SECTION]Lymphadenopathy
Lymphadenopathy is a common presenting condition. It may be
localised or generalised. The causes are multiple but a careful history
and clinical examination will often simplify the diagnosis.
Lymphadenopathy, especially cervical, is extremely common in children
who are otherwise healthy. Painful tender nodes are usually associated
with infection. Firm or hard, painless nodes are commonly the seat of
malignancy. Only the commoner causes, which the student would be
expected to know, are described in this section.

Causes
Primary Infection
Viral
• Infectious mononucleosis
• HIV
• CMV
• Rubella
• Measles

Bacterial
• TB • (common in parts of the world where TB is endemic)
• Syphilis
• Brucellosis
• Cat scratch disease
• Septicaemia

[START_SECTION]Protozoal
• Toxoplasmosis

Parasitic
• Filariasis • (common in tropical regions of Asia, Africa)

Secondary Infection
• e.g. tonsillitis with cervical lymphadenitis, abscess with
regional lymphadenitis

Primary Malignancy
• Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
• Chronic lymphatic leukaemia
• Hodgkin’s disease
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
• Myeloproliferative disorders

Secondary Malignancy
• Metastases from local malignancy
• Metastases from distant malignancy

Others
• Sarcoidosis
• SLE
• Rheumatoid arthritis

History
Infection
Local infections will be usually obvious, e.g. dental abscess with
cervical lymphadenopathy. With generalised lymphadenopathy, there
may be a history of malaise, lethargy and fever. Check for exposure to
TB, which may be a cause of lymphadenopathy in the

[START_SECTION]immunocompromised patient. Check for visits abroad. Check if there are
animals in the household, e.g. cats (cat scratch fever) or dogs
(toxoplasmosis). In the case of cat scratch fever, the scratches are often
healed before the patient presents. Note any history of local trauma.

Primary malignancy
There will normally be a history of malaise, fever or night sweats. The
patient may have noticed lumps at several sites. Spontaneous bruising
and bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia may also be present.

Secondary malignancy
The primary may be obvious or may be very small and have not been
noticed by the patient (e.g. a malignant melanoma in an inaccessible
site). There may be a history of malignancy that has been treated several
years previously with metastases presenting late (e.g. axillary
lymphadenopathy or cervical lymphadenopathy occurring several years
after an apparently curative operation for carcinoma of the breast).
Occasionally the lymph node swelling is distant from the primary, e.g.
cervical lymphadenopathy (left supraclavicular fossa) from testicular
cancer; Virchow’s node in gastric cancer.

Other conditions
Sarcoidosis causes bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy but may present
with lymphadenopathy at other sites. Check for a history of SLE or
rheumatoid arthritis.

Examination
Examine the enlarged lymph nodes. Are they painful and tender,
suggesting infection, or are they firm and painless, suggesting
malignancy? Check the sites draining to these nodes for a site of
infection or primary malignancy. Check for linear scratches suggestive

[START_SECTION]of cat scratch disease. Examine for bruising. Examine all other sites of
potential lymphadenopathy: cervical, axillary, inguinal, popliteal and
epitrochlear nodes. Check for splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Carry
out a full general examination.

General Investigations

■ Biopsy
Lymph node, e.g. Hodgkin’s disease, secondary deposit. Biopsy of local
lesion, e.g. infective versus malignant.
• An enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node in a patient
with weight loss suggests gastrointestinal malignancy.
• Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy with night sweats
suggests lymphoma or AIDS.
• Persistent cervical lymphadenopathy in the older patient
suggests malignancy and, in the absence of an obvious cause,
an ENT assessment is required.
• A solitary left supraclavicular node in a young male should
prompt examination of the testes.

[START_SECTION]Melaena
Melaena is the passage of altered blood PR. A melaena stool is black and
tarry and has a characteristic smell. The blood is degraded by
hydrochloric acid and intestinal enzymes high in the gastrointestinal
tract. Melaena is unlikely to occur if bleeding comes from lower than
the jejunum, although occasionally melaena may result from a bleeding
Meckel’s diverticulum.

Causes
Swallowed Blood
• Epistaxis
• Haemoptysis

Oesophagus
• Reflux oesophagitis
• Oesophageal varices
• Oesophageal carcinoma

Stomach
• Peptic ulceration
• Acute gastric erosions
• Mallory–Weiss syndrome
• Carcinoma
• Leiomyoma (gastrointestinal stromal tumour – GIST)
• Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia
• Vascular malformations

[START_SECTION]Duodenum
• Peptic ulceration
• Duodenal diverticulae
• Aortoduodenal fistulae
• Invasive pancreatic tumours
• Haemobilia

Small Intestine
• Leiomyoma (gastrointestinal stromal tumour – GIST)
• Meckel’s diverticulum

Bleeding Disorders
• Liver disease-associated
• Thrombocytopenia
• Haemophilia

Drugs
• Anticoagulants
• Aspirin
• NSAIDs
• Steroids

Others
• Uraemia
• Connective tissue disorders

Other Causes of Dark Stools
• Iron therapy
• Bismuth preparations
• Liquorice
• Charcoal biscuits
• Red wine (large quantities)

[START_SECTION]History
Swallowed blood
Check for a recent history of epistaxis or haemoptysis.

Oesophagus
There may be a history of excess alcohol consumption or a history of
other liver disease to suggest oesophageal varices. Check for
retrosternal burning pain and heartburn, which would suggest
oesophagitis. Check for a history of dysphagia. The bleeding associated
with varices is often torrential. That associated with oesophagitis is
minor.

Stomach
History of epigastric pain to suggest peptic ulceration. There may be a
history of steroid or NSAID medication. Mallory–Weiss syndrome
usually occurs in the younger patient who has had a large meal with
much alcohol and has a forceful vomit. The first vomit contains food, the
second contains blood. Acute gastric erosions may occur with stressful
illnesses, e.g. major surgery, acute pancreatitis, burns (Curling’s ulcer),
head injuries (Cushing’s ulcer). It is unusual to get a large bleed with a
carcinoma. Anaemia is a common presentation, and there may be ‘coffee
ground’ vomit. Leiomyoma causes a moderate haematemesis. There is
usually no preceding history. There will also be no preceding history
with vascular malformations. Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is
rare. The patient may present with a history of the condition, or it may
be apparent from the telangiectasia around the lips and oral cavity.

Duodenum
Melaena tends to be a more common symptom than haematemesis with
duodenal lesions. There may be a history of chronic duodenal

[START_SECTION]ulceration, although often presentation may be acute with little
background history. Bleeding from invasive pancreatic tumours is rare.
The patient will present with malaise, lethargy, weight loss and
vomiting. Haemobilia is rare. Aortoduodenal fistula is rare and usually
follows repair of an aneurysm with subsequent infection of the graft.
There is massive haematemesis and malaise.

Small intestine
Leiomyomas are rare but may bleed, resulting in melaena. Bleeding
from a Meckel’s diverticulum, if it occurs fast enough, usually causes
dark-red bleeding rather than characteristic melaena.

Other causes of dark stools
Take a full dietary and drug history.

Examination
Depending upon the severity of the bleed, there may be shock. The
patient will be cold, clammy, with peripheral vasoconstriction; there
will be a tachycardia and hypotension.

Swallowed blood
Check for blood around the nose. Examine the chest for a possible cause
of haemoptysis.

Oesophagus
There may be little to find on examination except clinical signs of
anaemia and weight loss, unless the cause is oesophageal varices, in
which case there may be jaundice, abdominal distension due to ascites,
spider naevi, liver palms, clubbing, gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy,
caput medusae, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly.

[START_SECTION]Stomach
There may be little to find on examination. There may be an epigastric
mass with a carcinoma, or a palpable left supraclavicular node
(Virchow’s nodes). There may be epigastric tenderness. With hereditary
haemorrhagic telangiectasia, there may be telangiectasia on the lips and
mucous membrane of the mouth.

Duodenum
Again, there may be little to find on examination other than epigastric
tenderness. In the rare case where duodenal bleeding comes from an
invasive pancreatic carcinoma, there may be a palpable mass in the
region of the pancreas.

Small intestine
Often there is little to find. Leiomyomas may be palpable.

Bleeding disorders
There may be sites of bruising or bleeding from other orifices.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ anaemia due to chronic bleeding, e.g. from carcinoma. ESR ↑
connective tissue disease.
■ U&Es
Urea and creatinine will be raised in uraemia. Urea may be raised due to
absorption of blood from the bowel.
■ LFTs
Liver failure, oesophageal varices, haemobilia.
■ Clotting screen
Liver disease. Bleeding diatheses. Anticoagulants.

[START_SECTION]Specific Investigations
■ OGD
Will demonstrate most lesions, e.g. varices, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer,
gastric erosions, Mallory–Weiss tear, carcinoma and rarer causes of
bleeding. Biopsy may be carried out where necessary.
■ Angiography
Vascular malformations. Also may diagnose rarer distal duodenal
causes, e.g. aortoduodenal fistulae.
■ Technetium scan
Meckel’s diverticulum containing gastric mucosa.
■ Labelled red cell scan
Rare small bowel causes of bleeding.
■ Small bowel enema
Leiomyoma. Meckel’s diverticulum.
• Melaena is altered blood PR. It is black and tarry and has a
characteristic smell. Take care to distinguish it from rectal
bleeding, which is either bright red or dark red and free from
odour.
• Melaena is unlikely to occur if bleeding comes from lower
down than the jejunum, although occasionally melaena may
result from a bleeding Meckel’s diverticulum.

[START_SECTION]Mouth Ulcers
Ulceration in the mouth is common. It is important to be able to
distinguish between simple benign ulcers, e.g. traumatic or aphthous,
and those that are malignant. Tongue lesions are dealt with on p. 463.

Causes
• Traumatic
• Aphthous (Fig. 45)

FIGURE 45 Aphthous ulcers.
These commonly occur in isolation, but they may be an indication of an
underlying intestinal disease such as gluten enteropathy or inflammatory
bowel disease.

Inflammatory
• Crohn’s disease

Infective
Bacterial

[START_SECTION]• Acute ulcerative gingivitis (Vincent’s angina)
• Syphilis

Neoplastic
• Squamous cell carcinoma
• Haematological disorders
• Agranulocytosis

Skin Disease-Associated
• Lichen planus
• Pemphigus
• Pemphigoid
• Bullous erythema multiforme

Connective Tissue Disease
• SLE

Other
• Behçet’s syndrome
• Reiter’s disease

History
Traumatic
Diagnosis usually obvious, such as ill-fitting dentures or sharp teeth and
ulcers heal when the precipitating cause is removed.

[START_SECTION]Aphthous
Patient presents with small, painful ulcers, usually inside the cheeks or
lips. They heal in about one week but others may occur while the initial
ulcers are healing. A number of patients will have a history of
gastrointestinal disease, e.g. coeliac disease or Crohn’s disease. They
may also arise in patients with debilitating disease.

Inflammatory
Chronic granulomatous disease (Crohn’s) may affect the oral cavity. The
patient may complain of painful ulcers, swelling of the lips or gum
swelling.

Infective
Vincent’s angina (acute ulcerative stomatitis) presents with swollen
gums with small ulcers, which may spread to the buccal mucosa. The
patient will complain of bleeding gums, together with constitutional
upset with fever and malaise. Syphilis is now rarely seen but chancres,
snail-track ulcers and gummas may occur within the mouth. Candida is
not uncommon in the oral cavity. There may be a history of debilitating
disease, diabetes or immunosuppressive therapy. Herpes simplex
presents as painful vesicles, which ulcerate. The patient may be
immunocompromised. Herpes zoster may occur on the palate in the
distribution of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. There will
be severe pain and ulceration.

Neoplastic
Squamous cell carcinomas occur as ulcers with hard edges, which bleed.
They tend to occur in the older patient. There may be a history of
leucoplakia or the six Ss: syphilis, smoking, sharp tooth, spirits, spices,
sepsis.

Haematological disorders

[START_SECTION]Haematological disorders
Agranulocytosis may be due to drugs or marrow infiltration. Take a
careful drug history. The ulceration may be due to bacterial infection
consequent on the low WCC. Leukaemia may also present with mouth
ulcers.

Skin disease-associated
These include lichen planus, pemphigus pemphigoid and bullous
erythema multiforme. The reader is referred to a textbook of
dermatology for the characteristics of these conditions.

Connective tissue disease
Oral ulceration may be associated with SLE. The patient may present
with other features of this disease, e.g. skin lesions, joint pains or renal
failure.

Other
Although Behçet’s disease may present with mouth ulcers, the patient
may also complain of arthritis, eye disease, scrotal or labial ulcers. With
Reiter’s disease, the patient will also complain of urethritis,
conjunctivitis and arthritis. There will usually be a history of sexual
contact.

Examination
Traumatic
There will be ulceration related to ill-fitting dentures or sharp teeth.
Observe for healing when the precipitating cause has been removed.

Aphthous
Small, white, circular, deep, painful ulcers with surrounding erythema.

[START_SECTION]There may be signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal disease or other
debilitating disease, or they may occur in otherwise healthy patients.

Inflammatory
With Crohn’s disease, there may be lip swelling, nodular thickening of
the buccal mucosa, diffuse granular gingival swelling or painful linea
oral ulcers.

Infective
Vincent’s angina presents with red, swollen, bleeding gums covered
with yellowish ulcers. The ulcers may also be seen on the buccal
mucosa and occasionally on the tonsils. There is usually tender
lymphadenopathy. With syphilis, there may be a chancre, snail-track
ulcers or gummas. Herpes simplex presents with small 2-mm vesicles,
which ulcerate and coalesce and produce erosions with surrounding
erythema. Herpes zoster shows small ulcers surrounded with erythema
in the distribution of the maxillary nerve on the palate. There will
usually be skin lesions in the distribution of the nerve. Candidiasis
appears as red patches on the buccal mucosa, which are covered with
white patches of desquamated epithelium mixed with fungus.

Neoplastic
There will be an ulcer with hard, everted edges which bleeds on
touching. Cervical lymphadenopathy may be present.

Haematological disorders
These present with bleeding gums and ulceration.

Skin disease-associated
The reader is referred to a textbook of dermatology for the characteristic

[START_SECTION]features of these.

Connective tissue disorders
Oral ulceration may occur with SLE. Other features may be present on
examination, e.g. skin, joint or renal disease.

Other
Behçet’s disease presents with painful ulcers. Other features may be
apparent on examination, e.g. arthritis, keratitis, iritis, scrotal or labial
ulcers. With Reiter’s syndrome, there will be urethritis, conjunctivitis
and balanitis, as well as mouth ulcers.

associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
• Mouth ulcers may be associated with vitamin and iron
deficiency. Check for associated glossitis and angular
cheilitis.
• Medication, e.g. carbimazole, may be associated with
agranulocytosis. Oral ulceration may be the first sign.

[START_SECTION]Muscle Weakness and Wasting
Muscle weakness and wasting may be caused by a variety of conditions
both systemic and those confined to muscles. Subjective weakness is
common and may not indicate significant illness.

Causes
Localised
• Peripheral nerve lesions
• Peripheral nerve compression
• Motor neuropathy
• Peripheral nerve transection
• Disuse atrophy
• Anterior horn cell lesions
• Previous poliomyelitis • (common in developing countries)

Generalised
Nutritional Deficiency
• Vitamin D deficiency

Systemic Disease
• Malignancy
• Cardiac and/or respiratory cachexia
• Thyrotoxicosis
• Sarcoidosis
• Guillain–Barré syndrome
• Cushing’s disease

[START_SECTION]• Addison’s disease

Muscle and Motor End Plate Disorders
• Myasthenia gravis
• Muscular dystrophies
• Motor neurone disease
• Myotonic dystrophy
• Polymyositis/dermatomyositis/inclusion body myositis

Drugs and Toxins
• Alcohol
• Statins
• Steroids
• Ciclosporin

History
Onset
Muscle weakness and wasting in childhood is often due to congenital
disease such as inherited muscular dystrophies (e.g. Duchenne’s
muscular dystrophy), a diagnosis further supported by a positive family
history of a first-degree relative with similar problems. With myotonic
dystrophy, first symptoms occur around the age of 15–30 years, while
with motor neurone disease, the peak age of onset is in the 50 s.

Site
The distribution of muscle wasting may characterise the disease.
Atrophy may be confined to the motor supply of a single nerve, such as
the thenar eminence with the median nerve affected by carpal tunnel
syndrome. It may also occur with a group of muscles such as the leg,
with polio. The distribution may be generalised in conditions such as
motor neurone disease. Distal weakness ascending to involve proximal

[START_SECTION]muscles is characteristic of Guillain–Barré syndrome.

Precipitating factors
Precipitating factors such as trauma may result in transection of a
peripheral nerve such as the ulnar nerve, commonly at the wrist.

Past medical history
The presence of carcinoma or chronic cardiorespiratory disease may
give rise to peripheral muscle wasting from cachexia. Previous infection
with polio is significant because, in a minority of affected individuals,
degeneration of anterior horn cells with subsequent paralysis and
muscle wasting occurs (post-polio syndrome). Disuse atrophy can be
localised or generalised. Conditions that result in immobility such as a
long-bone fracture will cause disuse atrophy of the surrounding
muscles; this is commonly seen upon removal of plaster casts. Localised
disuse atrophy may also result from joint pains such as quadriceps
wasting with painful knee disorders. Prolonged immobility will result
in generalised muscle wasting. Conditions such as diabetes and renal
failure are associated with neuropathy. Poor diet and lack of sun
exposure may lead to vitamin D deficiency.

Associated symptoms
Most of the causes are associated with weakness of the affected muscles.
Diplopia, ptosis and fatiguability are associated features suggestive of
myasthenia gravis. Motor neurone disease may present with progressive
weakness and wasting of the hand or leg accompanied with dysarthria
and dysphasia. Cushing’s disease may be associated with weight gain,
hair growth, acne, abdominal striae, muscle weakness, back pain and
depression.

Examination

[START_SECTION]Inspection will identify the areas of muscle wasting. Central obesity
with limb wasting occurs with Cushing’s disease. Generalised uniform
muscle wasting should lead to a careful examination of the organ
systems for malignancy and organ failure. Muscle tenderness may occur
with polymyositis.
Characteristic features of myotonic dystrophy are frontal balding,
ptosis, temporal and facial muscle wasting. Cataracts may be seen with
inspection of the eyes. Ptosis may also be a feature of myasthenia gravis;
this is accompanied by diplopia, facial weakness and a weak nasal
voice. Muscle wasting with fasciculations occurs with motor neurone
disease, no sensory loss is experienced and mixed upper and lower
motor neurone signs may be present.
Assessment of tone, reflexes and pattern of weakness will determine
whether it is an upper or lower motor neurone lesion. Delayed
relaxation of muscle contraction occurs with myotonic dystrophy and
proximal muscle weakness occurs with Cushing’s disease. With
localised muscle wasting, examination of each muscle will allow you to
determine whether the lesion arises from a single nerve or a nerve root.
Weakness, areflexia and sensory loss are seen with Guillain–Barré
syndrome.
The joint surrounded by wasted muscles should be examined for
deformity or pain that may restrict movement. Measurements of
circumference can be obtained to assess asymmetrical muscle wasting
of the limbs.
Proximal muscle weakness may be more evident than distal weakness
in many of the conditions listed. Specific assessment for this, such as
rising from a low chair or from a squatting position, is required.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Nail Abnormalities
Nail abnormalities are common and can give invaluable clues to
underlying systemic illness. Clubbing is dealt with in a separate section
(p. 64).

Causes
Congenital
• Epidermolysis bullosa

Acquired
Infections
• Fungal infection (onychomycosis)
• Chronic paronychia

Traumatic
• Nail biting
• Nailbed trauma

Systemic Illness
• Severe systemic illness (Beau’s lines)
• Iron deficiency anaemia (koilonychia)
• Chronic liver disease (leuconychia)
• Diabetes mellitus (leuconychia)
• Psoriatic arthritis
• Plummer–Vinson syndrome (koilonychia)

Dermatological

Wright and the EULAR Image Database.)

Other
• Onychogryphosis
• Raynaud’s syndrome
• Autoimmune disease
• Yellow nail syndrome

History
Congenital
A history of severe skin disease from birth will be apparent with
epidermolysis bullosa.

Acquired
Infections
A history of discoloration of the nail will be present with chronic fungal

[START_SECTION]infections. Chronic paronychia leads to pain, swelling and tenderness in
the area of the nailfold.

Traumatic
A history of severe or recurrent damage to the nail may be present.
Enquiry as to whether the patient is a nail-biter is important.

Systemic illness
The patient must be asked about severe illness of any description, as this
may have led to trophic nail changes with transverse ridges (Beau’s
lines), which may occur up to three months following the insult.
Symptoms of joint pain, stiffness and swelling will be present with
psoriatic arthritis. In iron deficiency anaemia, patients often describe
lethargy, shortness of breath and/or chest pain on minimal exertion.
Frank blood loss (haematemesis, melaena) will usually be volunteered
by the patient; however, history of dyspepsia or vague upper abdominal
pain may be a clue to occult blood loss. Plummer–Vinson syndrome
occurs in middle-aged women. It is an iron deficiency anaemia
associated with koilonychia, a smooth tongue and dysphagia. A history
for the possible causes of chronic liver disease should be sought such as
alcohol abuse or hepatitis. Symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia and
lethargy suggest diabetes mellitus.

Dermatological
The scaly rash of psoriasis is classically found on the knees, elbows and
scalp; however, lesions may be described in the external meatus,
umbilicus, glans penis and natal cleft. An eczematous rash may be
present diffusely and is often itchy.

Other
Onychogryphosis is a ‘ram’s horn’ deformity of the nail. It usually
affects the great toenail. The nail thickens and curls over as it grows.
Common in the elderly, it may follow trauma to the nail in the younger

[START_SECTION]patient. The nail is greatly deformed and difficult to cut. In autoimmune
disease, the patient may describe hair loss in alopecia areata and
sclerodactyly in systemic sclerosis. In classic Raynaud’s phenomenon,
the fingers turn white, blue, then red upon exposure to cold
environments. In yellow nail syndrome, the nails are typically slow
growing with yellow discoloration. It is associated with lymphoedema,
pleural effusions and in some cases, bronchiectasis and chronic
sinusitis.

Examination
Congenital
Severe skin disease will be apparent with epidermolysis bullosa.

Acquired
Infections
A discolored, thick and possibly malformed nail will be seen with
chronic fungal infections. A swollen, red, tender nailfold will be present
with chronic paronychia.

Traumatic
A malformed nail will be seen. Severe nail-biters will have nails bitten
back to the nailbed.

Systemic illness
Swollen deformed joints may be seen with psoriatic arthritis. Check for
associated psoriatic plaques. If the patient suffered from severe systemic
illness, this may have resolved; however, trophic nail changes may be
seen following this. In iron deficiency anaemia, pallor, angular cheilitis
and spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia) may be present. Features of
chronic liver disease might be present along with leuconychia.
Leuconychia may also be seen with diabetes.

[START_SECTION]Dermatological
Scaly, silvery plaques of psoriasis will be seen, which may be localised
or diffuse. Eczema may also be present either as localised or diffuse
lesions.

Other
A grossly deformed, usually great toenail, will be seen with
onychogryphosis. The nail thickens and curls over as it grows. Distal
finger atrophic changes may be seen following longstanding Raynaud’s
phenomenon. In yellow nail syndrome, the nails are typically slow
growing with yellow discoloration. Lymphoedema usually affects the
lower limb. Examine the chest for signs of bronchiectasis and pleural
effusions. Abdominal examination may reveal ascites.

General Investigations
The diagnosis of most nail abnormalities is made on clinical
examination alone.
■ FBC
↓ Hb, ↓ MCV, ↓ MCHC.
■ Blood film
Microcytic RBCs in iron deficiency.
■ Serum iron and TIBC
↓ serum iron, ↑ TIBC with iron deficiency.
■ Serum ferritin
↓ iron deficiency anaemia.
■ Blood glucose
Diabetes.
■ LFTs
Cirrhosis.
■ Urinalysis
Diabetes.

Specific Investigations

[START_SECTION]Specific Investigations
■ Nail clippings
Fungal infections.
■ Skin biopsy
Psoriasis, eczema.
■ Hand X-rays
Psoriatic arthritis.
■ CXR
Chest abnormalities with yellow nail syndrome, e.g. bronchiectasis,
pleural effusion.
■ ANA
Systemic sclerosis.
• Always examine the nails. It may be necessary to ask female
patients to remove nail varnish.
• It may be difficult to differentiate between psoriatic nail
dystrophy and fungal infections. Always confirm the
diagnosis with nail clippings before starting a patient on a
lengthy course of anti-fungal treatment.

[START_SECTION]Nasal Discharge
Nasal discharges are common. The most frequent causes are the
common cold and allergic rhinitis. Persistent bloodstained nasal
discharge is a serious symptom requiring urgent investigation.

Causes
Congenital
• Choanal atresia

Acquired
Infective
• Common cold (coryza)
• Chronic rhinitis
• Sinusitis
• Adenoiditis (large adenoids)
• Viral infections
• Chronic infections
• Fungal infections
• Syphilis
• AIDS • (common in certain developing countries)

Allergic
• Allergic rhinitis

Inflammatory
• Nasal polyps
• Non-eosinophilic vasomotor rhinitis

[START_SECTION]• Eosinophilic vasomotor rhinitis

Neoplastic
• Carcinoma
• Nasopharynx • (common in South-east Asia)
• Sinuses
• Lymphoma (malignant granuloma)

Granulomatous Disease
• Wegener’s granulomatosis
• Churg–Strauss syndrome

Traumatic
• Foreign body
• Fracture of the anterior fossa
• Irritant gases, e.g. chlorine, tobacco smoke

Degenerative
• Senile rhinorrhoea

History
Congenital
Choanal atresia is rare. Check for other congenital abnormalities.
Bilateral choanal atresia is a life-threatening condition in newborn
infants. Unilateral atresia may not be picked up until 5–10 years of age,
when it becomes apparent that one nostril is blocked and there is a thick
mucus discharge.

Acquired
Infective
The patient will often have a common cold. There is a mucoid nasal

[START_SECTION]discharge, which settles rapidly once the cold has settled. With chronic
rhinitis, there may be a chronic purulent discharge. This is often thick
and mucoid. There may be a history of immunological deficiency or
cystic fibrosis. With sinusitis, there may be pain or discomfort over the
maxillary sinuses or a headache with pain over the frontal sinuses. With
large adenoids, there may be a complaint of mouth breathing, recurrent
pharyngeal infections, snoring and recurrent ear infections. Fungal
infections of the nose are rare, occurring in immunosuppressed patients.
Candida albicans and Aspergillus spp. are the most common organisms.
Chronic infective lesions include syphilis. Secondary syphilis can affect
the nose and cause a catarrhal rhinitis. Usually, other lesions of syphilis
will be present. AIDS may be associated with a watery nasal discharge.
Check for HIV risk factors. Other symptoms of AIDS may be present.

Allergic
Allergic rhinitis
There may be a history of infantile eczema, allergic asthma, nasal or
conjunctival allergy. It may be seasonal with an allergy to pollen or
perennial with exposure to animal dander (cats) or house-dust mites.
The patient complains of watery rhinorrhoea, sneezing attacks, nasal
obstruction, conjunctival irritation and lacrimation. There is usually a
family history.

Inflammatory
Vasomotor rhinitis
Eosinophilic vasomotor rhinitis presents with a watery nasal discharge
and sneezing. No type I allergic reaction is involved in this condition.
The condition is associated with nasal polyps, aspirin sensitivity and
asthma.
Nasal polyps
These occur in non-allergic eosinophilic vasomotor rhinitis. The patient

[START_SECTION]will complain of nasal obstruction and discharge.
Non-eosinophilic vasomotor rhinitis
The patient presents with watery nasal discharge, nasal obstruction and
sneezing attacks. This condition may be associated with: (1) certain
antihypertensive drugs, particularly ganglion blockers and vasodilators;
(2) hormonal disturbances; (3) congestive cardiac failure; (4) anxiety
states; (5) occupational irritants, e.g. ammonia, smoke.

Neoplastic
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is rare in Europe but is common in Southeast Asia. The patient presents with nasal obstruction and bloodstained
discharge. Unilateral otitis media may occur from eustachian tube
blockage. Nerve palsies may occur due to invasion of the base of the
skull. The patient may complain only of a swelling in the neck due to
lymphadenopathy; lymphatic spread occurring at an early stage. With
this disease, unilateral deafness, cervical lymphadenopathy and cranial
nerve palsies are often diagnostic.
Carcinoma of the maxillary sinus
This is often diagnosed late. Early presenting symptoms include
bloodstained nasal discharge and unilateral nasal obstruction. Later,
swelling of the cheek occurs, with ulceration of the palate. Epiphora
may occur due to invasion of the nasolacrimal duct. Erosion into the
orbit results in proptosis and diplopia. Pain may be referred to the ear.
Malignant granuloma
Malignant granuloma (now thought to be lymphomatous) presents with
slowly progressive ulceration, starting in the region of the nose. The
chronic inflammatory reaction causes a nasal discharge.

Granulomatous disease

[START_SECTION]Wegener’s granulomatosis and Churg–Strauss syndrome affect the nose
and are associated with disease of the kidneys, lungs and respiratory
tract. The patient may present with either lung manifestations or renal
failure.

Traumatic
The commonest trauma causing a nasal discharge is a foreign body. The
patient is usually a child aged between 1 and 5 years, or rarely, a
psychiatrically-disturbed adult. The child is usually miserable with a
smelly, bloodstained nasal discharge. In adults, rhinolith may occur.
This results in unilateral obstruction and discharge. There is usually a
large concretion blocking the nose, which may have a foreign body at
the centre, with calcium and magnesium laid down around it. Following
fracture of the anterior fossa, sustained during head injury, the patient
may complain of a clear nasal discharge (CSF rhinorrhoea) or a
bloodstained nasal discharge. Irritant gases, e.g. chlorine, which may be
industrial or in excess in swimming pools, may cause irritation of the
nasal mucosa, with discharge.

Degenerative
Senile rhinorrhoea occurs in the elderly. It is thought to be due to failure
of vasomotor control.

Examination
Choanal atresia
Pass a probe or catheter into the nasal cavity. It will not pass. Posterior
rhinoscopy under general anaesthetic will confirm the diagnosis.

Infective
With a common cold, there will be oedematous nasal mucosa with clear
mucus in the nose. With chronic rhinitis, there will be thick mucus or a

[START_SECTION]purulent nasal discharge. With enlarged adenoids, mirror examination
will reveal the diagnosis.

Allergic
Allergic rhinitis reveals an oedematous nasal mucosa with clear mucus
in the nose.

Inflammatory
The appearance of eosinophilic vasomotor rhinitis is similar to that of
allergic rhinitis, except that nasal polyps may be seen. Nasal polyps are
usually pink and smooth or a yellowish-grey and pedunculated. With
non-eosinophilic vasomotor rhinitis, excessive secretions will be noted
on examination, with engorgement of the inferior turbinates. Often the
signs are not as severe as the symptoms would suggest.

Neoplastic
Examination should include visualisation of the post-nasal space, under
general anaesthetic if necessary. A full examination of the cranial nerves
must be made. With carcinoma of the maxillary sinus, there may be
swelling of the cheek with ulceration of the palate. Epiphora may occur
due to invasion of the nasolacrimal duct. Check for proptosis and
diplopia due to invasion into the orbit. Examine the neck for cervical
nodes. With malignant granuloma, there is slowly progressive
ulceration of the face, starting in the region of the nose.

Granulomatous disease
With Wegener’s granulomatosis or Churg–Strauss syndrome, necrotic
mucosal ulceration occurs. There may be co-existing otitis media,
ulceration of the mouth or involvement of the trachea or larynx. There
may be lung involvement, eye involvement and renal disease.

[START_SECTION]Traumatic
Examination with a nasal speculum will usually reveal the foreign body.
With CSF rhinorrhoea, it may be difficult to distinguish bleeding from
blood mixed with CSF. Place a drop of the bloodstained discharge on a
clean white gauze. If CSF is present, there will be a spreading yellowish
ring around the central stain of blood (halo sign). With irritant gases,
there will be redness and oedema of the nasal mucosa. There will almost
certainly be eye irritation and a skin reaction accompanying it.

Degenerative
With senile rhinorrhoea, there are usually no physical signs apart from
the nasal drip.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR and CRP
Hb ↓ malignancy, granulomatous disease. WCC ↑ infection, e.g.
adenoiditis. ESR and CRP ↑ infection, malignancy, granulomatous

• Persistent bloodstained nasal discharge is a serious sign and
further investigation is required to exclude malignancy.

[START_SECTION]Neck Lumps
A lump in the neck is a common problem in surgical practice. It is
necessary to be able to distinguish the different causes, which may vary
from a simple benign swelling to part of a generalised malignant
condition.

Causes
Superficial
• Sebaceous cyst
• Lipoma
• Abscess
• Dermoid cyst

Lymph nodes
• Superficial
• Deep

Anterior Triangle
Move on Swallowing
• Thyroid
• Thyroglossal cyst (Fig. 47)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 47 Thyroglossal cyst.
There is a midline swelling in the neck, which moved on swallowing, and
tongue protrusion.

Do not Move on Swallowing
• Salivary glands
• Branchial cyst
• Carotid body tumour
• Carotid aneurysm
• Sternomastoid ‘tumour’

Posterior Triangle
• Cervical rib
• Subclavian artery aneurysm
• Pharyngeal pouch
• Cystic hygroma

History
Symptoms
The diagnosis of superficial swellings of the neck should be obvious. A
sebaceous cyst will usually have grown slowly and may have been
painful and red if infected. Lipomas tend to grow slowly. An abscess
will be obvious from pain and tenderness. Lymphadenopathy may be
associated with a recent pyrexial illness, local lesions in the head and
neck, generalised infection or generalised malignancy. Swelling during
mastication suggests a salivary gland origin. Blackouts or dizziness
may suggest a carotid body tumour. A lump in the lower part of the
posterior triangle, increasing in size after eating, and gurgling when full,

[START_SECTION]suggests a pharyngeal pouch. The patient may experience bouts of
coughing or choking when lying down as the pouch empties itself and
aspiration occurs. Neurological or vascular symptoms in the upper limb
may be associated with a cervical rib. Sternomastoid tumours are rare
and occur in the neonate. Cystic hygromas are rare and occur in infancy.

Past medical history
A history of HIV infection, TB and malignancy is relevant. Breech or
forceps delivery may be relevant to the development of a sternomastoid
tumour.

Examination
Decide whether the swelling is superficial or deep. Decide whether it is
likely to be due to lymphadenopathy. If the swelling is deep, decide
whether it is in the anterior triangle of the neck or the posterior triangle.
If it is in the anterior triangle, decide whether it moves on swallowing
(thyroid-associated) or not.

Sebaceous cyst
This is usually obvious, being in the skin and having a punctum.

Lipoma
May occur anywhere in the neck but often occurs in the midline
posteriorly. Lipomas are soft and lobulated and not fixed to the skin.

Dermoid cyst
These may be congenital or acquired. The congenital ones are most
common in the head and neck and occur where skin dermatomes fuse.
They are not unlike sebaceous cysts on examination but lack a punctum.
Acquired implantation dermoids usually occur in relation to scars.

[START_SECTION]Abscess
The diagnosis will usually be obvious. There will be a tender, red,
inflamed swelling. They may occur in relation to lymph nodes or
salivary glands.

Lymphadenopathy
Depending upon the cause of the condition, lymph nodes will be
enlarged and tender; non-tender and firm or rubbery or small, hard and
matted together. A check should be made for enlarged lymph nodes
elsewhere in the body and for hepatosplenomegaly. Generalised
lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly will occur with blood dyscrasias.

Thyroid
Thyroid swellings move on swallowing. Associated lymphadenopathy
will suggest malignancy. The thyroid status of the patient should be
checked on clinical examination.

Thyroglossal cyst
This is a painless cystic swelling in the midline of the neck that moves
on swallowing. It also moves on protrusion of the tongue. It is
commonly attached to the body of the hyoid bone. Occasionally it may
become infected, with pain, tenderness and increased swelling.

Salivary gland
Swelling of the submandibular salivary gland is most frequently due to
obstruction of the submandibular duct. Swelling will be noted on
mastication. A stone may be palpated in the submandibular duct in the
floor of the mouth. Swelling of the parotid gland may be due to duct
obstruction, although tumour is more common with this gland.
Malignant tumours of the parotid gland may be associated with facial

[START_SECTION]nerve palsy.

Branchial cyst
A branchial cyst feels soft and putty-like and abuts from the anterior
border of sternocleidomastoid at the junction between its upper and
middle thirds.

Carotid body tumour
This feels firm and is located at the bifurcation of the common carotid
artery.

Carotid aneurysm
These are extremely rare. False ones may follow surgery or trauma to
the neck. A tortuous carotid artery may be mistaken for a carotid
aneurysm.

Sternomastoid ‘tumour’
This appears only in babies and is a result of birth trauma. There is a
swelling in the middle third of the sternomastoid. The head becomes
turned to the opposite side and tilted towards the shoulder on the side of
the lesion.

Cervical rib
A bony, hard swelling may be palpable in the posterior triangle of the
neck.

Subclavian artery aneurysm
Obvious as a pulsatile, expansile swelling in the lower part of the
posterior triangle. Often associated with a cervical rib.

[START_SECTION]Pharyngeal pouch
Presents behind the lower border of sternomastoid in the posterior
triangle. It may fill after a meal and empty after lying down. Signs of
aspiration pneumonitis may be present.

Cystic hygromas
This is a collection of dilated lymphatics, which presents in infancy. It is
soft, lobulated, fluctuant, compressible and brilliantly transilluminable.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ malignancy. WCC ↑ infection and leukaemia. ESR ↑ infection and
malignancy.
■ CXR
May show TB or primary or secondary tumour. Tracheal deviation may
be associated with thyroid swellings. A cervical rib may be seen. Count
the ribs. If there are 13, it is likely that there is a cervical rib.
■ US
This may be helpful in almost any lump in the neck. It will also
distinguish between solid and cystic swellings, e.g. in the thyroid.

Specific Investigations
A detailed history and examination may suggest the aetiology of the
swelling. Further confirmatory investigations may be required for
specific cases.
■ Paul–Bunnell test
For glandular fever.
■ Toxoplasma screen
Toxoplasmosis.
■ Mantoux test
For TB.

[START_SECTION]■ Viral titres
For any viral infection that may cause cervical lymphadenopathy.
■ HIV screen
AIDS.
■ TFTs
If clinical examination reveals a swelling to be a goitre.
■ FNAC
Especially useful for swellings of lymph nodes, thyroid or salivary
glands.
■ CT
Helpful with the diagnosis of almost any mass but particularly helpful
with confirming the diagnosis of carotid body tumours.
■ Duplex Doppler
For suspected carotid artery aneurysm or subclavian artery aneurysm.
■ Floor of mouth X-ray
Will identify a calculus in the submandibular duct.
■ Sialography
Contrast study of salivary duct to locate possible cause and site of
obstruction, e.g. stone or stricture.
■ Barium swallow
To confirm the presence of a pharyngeal pouch. Never perform an
endoscopy if a pouch is suspected, as perforation of the pouch may
result.
■ OGD
To check for a primary oesophageal or gastric carcinoma causing
cervical lymphadenopathy.
■ Bronchoscopy
Check for carcinoma of the lung associated with cervical gland
metastases.
• If cervical lymphadenopathy is thought to be due to
malignancy, the patient should be referred for an urgent ENT
opinion.
• Dysphagia in association with a neck swelling is likely to

[START_SECTION]represent serious underlying pathology.

[START_SECTION]Neck Pain
Neck pain is a common problem. The majority of cases are due to poor
posture or cervical spondylosis. If there has been a history of trauma,
extreme care must be exercised in examination of the neck and any Xrays must be strictly supervised.

Causes
Congenital
• Torticollis
• Klippel–Feil syndrome

Acquired
Traumatic
• Fractures
• Dislocations
• Whiplash injury

Inflammatory
• Rheumatoid arthritis

Infective
• TB • (common where TB is endemic)

Degenerative
• Cervical spondylosis (Fig. 48)
• Cervical disc lesion

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 48 A lateral radiograph of the cervical spine showing cervical
spondylosis.
There is gross anterior lipping of C5, 6 and 7. There is marked narrowing
of the disc spaces. There will be pain and stiffness in the neck with pain
radiating down the arm in the distribution of the nerve roots affected.

Neoplastic
• Secondary deposits

Other
• Postural
• Exposure to cold
• Meningitis
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage

History
Congenital
Torticollis may be congenital and present at birth due to sternomastoid
‘tumour’. This is a rare condition often associated with breech delivery.
Klippel–Feil syndrome is rare and is characterised by developmental
abnormalities of the cervical vertebrae and a high-riding scapula.

[START_SECTION]Acquired
Traumatic
History of trauma may be evident and it is important to screen for any
neurological sequelae, e.g. arm pain or weakness or bladder symptoms.
Whiplash injuries are common. These occur in road traffic accidents
where the car is struck from behind. The neck extends with sudden
acceleration and flexes forward with sudden deceleration.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis frequently affects the neck, particularly the
atlantoaxial joints, which may undergo subluxation. There will usually
be a history of rheumatoid arthritis elsewhere. The patient complains of
pain in the neck, difficulty in walking and there may be progressive
bladder involvement.

Infective
TB of the cervical spine is rare in the UK. There is usually a history of TB
elsewhere.

Degenerative
Cervical spondylosis is the commonest condition involving the neck.
The patient complains of neck pain and stiffness with radiation of pain
into the occiput, shoulder or arms. There may be complaints of
weakness of grip and wasting of the hand. Acute cervical disc lesions
may cause acute neck pain, with referred pain to the arm with weakness.
Central disc protrusion may cause bladder problems or even paraplegia.

Neoplastic
Primary tumours of the cervical vertebrae are extremely rare. Secondary
deposits may occur from breast, bronchus, lung, prostate or kidney. The
patient may have had surgery for carcinoma of one of these organs. If
not, check for a history suggesting a lesion. The patient will present with
pain and collapse of a vertebra, perhaps with neurological symptoms.

[START_SECTION]Other
Postural neck pain is common and relates to changes in neck posture,
the patient often complaining of sleeping in an ‘awkward’ position. The
pain is usually across the neck and shoulders. The patient may also
complain of exposure to cold, e.g. ‘sitting in a draught’. Meningitis may
cause a stiff neck with pain, as does subarachnoid haemorrhage. The
diagnosis of these will usually be obvious from the history. The
headache radiates into the neck and causes neck stiffness.

Examination
Congenital
Torticollis – the head is pulled down to the affected side and often
rotated to the opposite side. Klippel–Feil syndrome presents with a short
neck and a high-riding scapula.

Acquired
Traumatic
Treat the patient as for spinal injury, with stabilisation of the neck.
Carry out a full neurological examination. Any X-ray examination
should be strictly supervised by an experienced orthopaedic surgeon.
With whiplash injuries, there is usually only ligamentous and soft-tissue
damage. Localised tenderness may be present. Check for pain and
paraesthesia in the arms and hands.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis will be apparent elsewhere, e.g. hand deformities,
ulnar deviation. Carry out a full neurological examination.

Infective
With TB, the patient will be generally unwell with spasm in the neck
muscles. There may be evidence of paravertebral abscess. Carry out a

[START_SECTION]full neurological examination.

Degenerative
There will be reduced neck movements. Carry out a full neurological
examination. There will often be weakness of grip, muscle wasting and
reduced reflexes. Acute disc lesions result in pain and spasm of the neck
muscles. There may be weakness of the arm and reduced reflexes. Carry
out a full neurological examination.

Neoplastic
Examine the possible sites of primary tumours, e.g. breast, bronchus,
prostate, thyroid, kidney. Carry out a full neurological examination.

Other
With postural neck pain or cold exposure, there is usually little to find
on examination. There may be some localised muscular tenderness.
With meningitis, the patient is usually ill, with photophobia, headache,
stiff neck and a positive Kernig’s sign. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is
usually diagnosed from the history.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ anaemia of chronic disease, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. WCC ↑
infection. ESR ↑ rheumatoid arthritis, TB, malignancy.
■ Rheumatoid factor
Rheumatoid arthritis.
■ X-ray
Fractures (supervised X-rays), cervical spondylosis – narrowing of joint
spaces, osteophytes. Rheumatoid arthritis – atlantoaxial subluxation.
Secondary deposits. Congenital anomalies.

Specific Investigations

[START_SECTION]■ CT
Disc lesion. TB. Subarachnoid haemorrhage.
■ MRI
Disc lesions – cord compression.
■ Bone scan
Secondary deposits. Acute arthritis.
■ Lumbar puncture
Meningitis. Subarachnoid haemorrhage.
• If there has been a history of trauma, extreme care must be
exercised in examination of the neck and any X-rays must be
strictly supervised.
• Neck pain and stiffness may be early signs of meningitis.
Check carefully for petechiae.

[START_SECTION]Nipple Discharge
This is a common problem. It is embarrassing for the patient, as
discharge may leak through and stain clothing. Bloodstained nipple
discharge may be due to an underlying carcinoma.

Causes
Serous
• Early pregnancy
• Fibroadenosis

Milky
• Late pregnancy
• Lactation
• Lactorrhoea of the newborn (witch’s milk)
• Puberty
• Prolactinoma (tumour of the anterior pituitary gland)

Coloured
Yellow, Brown, Green
• Fibroadenosis

Thick and Creamy
• Duct ectasia

Purulent
• Retroareolar abscess
• Breast abscess

[START_SECTION]• TB

Bloodstained
• Intraduct carcinoma
• Intraduct papilloma
• Paget’s disease of the nipple
• Jogger’s nipple

History
Pregnancy or lactation will be apparent. Discharge may occur from the
nipples of newborn babies of either sex (witch’s milk). It is due to the
passage of female hormones across the placenta. Discharge, either
serous or milky, may occur at puberty. Cyclical mastalgia with a
coloured discharge, especially greenish, suggests fibroadenosis. A
patient in the fifth decade with a history of retroareolar pain and a thick
creamy discharge may have duct ectasia. A bloodstained discharge must
be taken seriously and fully investigated. The patient may describe this
as frank, red blood or altered blood, which may be darkish brown. It is
important to know whether it has come from one duct or several. Does
the patient have an underlying lump? Profuse milky discharge
associated with amenorrhoea will suggest the possibility of
prolactinoma of the anterior pituitary gland. Jogger’s nipple is fairly
common in male athletes. It is more common in male athletes than
females, since most women wear a bra when working out and that
protects the nipple. Jogger’s nipple occurs when the nipple and the
areola become irritated as the nipple rubs up against damp, rough
fabric. Crusting, soreness and even bleeding of the nipple tissue occur.

Examination
Is the discharge obvious? It may have stained the clothes and the colour
of it may be apparent. Is it associated with a painful and lumpy breast to

[START_SECTION]suggest fibroadenosis? Is it possible to express the discharge by manual
pressure? Occasionally it is possible, by manual pressure on specific
areas of the breast, to express blood from one particular duct. Is there an
underlying discrete lump suggestive of a carcinoma? Is there
retroareolar tenderness, lumpiness and nipple retraction, suggestive of
duct ectasia? Are there any signs of infection or abscess? Has the nipple
been destroyed, as in Paget’s disease? If prolactinoma is suspected
(galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea, infertility), the visual fields should be
checked, as a macroadenoma of the anterior pituitary gland may
impinge on the optic chiasma. In jogger’s nipple, there will be crusting,
fissuring and bleeding from nipple tissue.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
WCC ↑ in infection. ESR ↑ in tumour and TB.
■ Swab
C&S. Infection, abscess, TB.
■ FNAC
Carcinoma.
■ Dipstick testing
Blood versus other fluid.

Specific Investigations
■ Mammography
Carcinoma, duct ectasia.
■ Microdochectomy
If bleeding is localised to an individual duct, this is an appropriate
surgical investigation. It may demonstrate intraduct papilloma or
intraduct carcinoma.
■ CT head
Prolactinoma of the pituitary gland.

[START_SECTION]• A bloodstained nipple discharge is serious. An underlying
carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis. Referral to a breast
surgeon for full assessment is required.
• Always remember pregnancy in the patient with bilateral
serous discharge.
• If the discharge is bilateral and not bloodstained, serious
breast disease is unlikely.
• Destruction of the nipple suggests Paget’s disease.
• Nipple discharge in a male is always abnormal. Full
investigation is required.

[START_SECTION]Oedema
Oedema is the accumulation of excessive fluid in the subcutaneous
tissue. When oedema results from lymphatic stasis, the term
lymphoedema is used. Oedema may be pitting or non-pitting.
Subcutaneous oedema is referred to as pitting when, after pressure is
applied to a small area, the indentation persists for some time after
release of the pressure (Fig. 49). Pitting oedema is caused by either
systemic diseases (generalised) or local conditions involving just the
affected extremities. The most common systemic diseases involve the
heart, liver and kidneys. In these diseases, oedema occurs primarily
because of water retention or fluid leaking into the interstitial spaces.
The most common local conditions that cause oedema involve venous
obstruction, e.g. varicose veins, DVT. Non-pitting oedema is observed
when the indentation does not persist, e.g. lymphoedema, myxoedema.

FIGURE 49 (A,B) Pitting oedema in a patient with cardiac failure.
A depression (‘pit’) remains in the oedema for some minutes after firm fingertip
pressure is applied.

Causes

[START_SECTION]Generalised
Increased Plasma Hydrostatic Pressure
• Congestive cardiac failure
• Vasodilatory drugs – nifedipine

Decreased Plasma Oncotic Pressure
• Liver disease
• Renal disease, e.g. nephrotic syndrome
• Malnutrition/malabsorption • (very common in the developing
world)

Impairment of Lymphatic Drainage*
• Congenital deficiency of lymphatics

• Angio-oedema – anaphylaxis, e.g. secondary to drugs
(ACEI)

Localised

[START_SECTION]• Local infection
• Trauma

• Animal bites/stings
• Hypothyroidism
*Indicates the causes of lymphoedema.

History
Site and distribution
Enquiries should be made regarding the site of oedema, as localised and
demarcated sites of oedema are usually due to trauma or infection.
Oedema may be confined to both lower limbs, for example with IVC
obstruction and pregnancy, or affect only a single limb, such as the leg
with unilateral DVT or arm following axillary lymph node clearance.

Precipitating factors
Precipitating factors such as trauma and infection may be obvious from
the history, and should be excluded. Angio-oedema may be precipitated
by a known allergen. Lymphoedema may result as a complication of
infection with filarial nematodes while travelling in endemic areas such
as Africa, Asia and Australia. Lymphoedema may also be congenital,
occurring shortly after birth (Milroy’s disease) or at puberty
(lymphoedema praecox) or in the third decade (lymphoedema tarda).

Past medical and drug history
Interruption to lymphatic drainage may result as a complication of
irradiation or surgery, especially in the region of the axilla and groin.
Obstruction of lymphatic flow can also result from direct involvement
of the lymph nodes by lymphoma, or secondary to metastatic lymphatic

[START_SECTION]infiltration from tumours. A detailed drug history will identify any
offending drug.

Associated symptoms
If there is no obvious precipitating factor in the history, then specific
enquiries should be undertaken for each system. Symptoms suggestive
of malignancy, in particular, should be sought. In addition, it is
important to exclude the following conditions.

Cardiac failure
Lethargy, dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea,
cough, ankle oedema and abdominal distension from ascites may be
some symptoms experienced by patients with cardiac failure.

Liver disease
Symptoms of jaundice, pruritus, ankle oedema, abdominal distension,
haematemesis and confusion (encephalopathy) should be sought to
determine the presence of liver disease.

Renal disease – nephrotic syndrome
Severe generalised oedema is the prominent feature with nephrotic
syndrome. Patients may also complain of frothy urine due to
proteinuria.

Malabsorption
Weight loss, diarrhoea and steatorrhoea may be some of the features
associated with malabsorption.

Venous thrombosis
Unilateral leg swelling and pain are the main symptoms of DVT.
Occasionally with iliofemoral vein thrombosis, the entire leg may
appear blue (phlegmasia cerulea dolens) or white (phlegmasia alba

[START_SECTION]dolens). Bilateral leg oedema with the onset of dilated superficial
collateral veins on the trunk and abdomen is suggestive of IVC
obstruction.

Examination
Inspection
Assessment of the distribution of oedema may narrow the differential
diagnosis. Generalised causes tend to present with dependent oedema,
with fluid accumulating in the ankles in ambulant patients and the
sacrum in recumbent patients.

Cardiovascular system
With cardiac failure, palpation of the pulse may reveal tachycardia with
pulsus alternans. The measured blood pressure may be low due to
systolic failure. The JVP is elevated and a third heart sound with
bilateral coarse pulmonary crepitations may be auscultated.
Hepatomegaly due to liver congestion and ascites may also be present.

Abdominal examination
Generalised wasting from malabsorption or malignancy may be
appreciated on inspection. Clubbing, palmar erythema, Dupuytren’s
contracture, jaundice, spider naevi and gynaecomastia are signs of liver
disease. Dilated collateral veins on the abdomen may be due to portal
hypertension or IVC obstruction; therefore, determine the direction of
blood flow. Below the umbilicus, the direction of blood flow is inferior
with portal hypertension, and superior with IVC obstruction.
Organomegaly due to carcinoma may be present and predispose to
venous thrombosis. Pelvic malignancy may also result in venous
outflow obstruction.

Legs

[START_SECTION]Check if the oedema is pitting or non-pitting. The legs are examined for
the presence of tenderness and swelling. Circumferences of both the
thighs and calves are compared. Marked painful erythematous
unilateral swelling may be indicative of a DVT.

General Investigations
■ Urinalysis
Heavy proteinuria with nephrotic syndrome.
■ FBC
WCC ↑ infection and DVT. Hb ↓ malabsorption.
■ U&Es
Urea and creatinine ↑ with renal failure.
■ LFTs

■ Pelvic ultrasound or CT
Pelvic tumours.
• Sudden onset of oedema in the lower limb is highly
suggestive of deep venous thrombosis. Urgent investigation
and treatment is required to prevent pulmonary embolism.

[START_SECTION]Oliguria
Oliguria is the passage of less than 400 mL of urine in 24 hours. Anuria
is failure to pass any urine.

Causes
Renal Circulatory Insufficiency
• Dehydration, e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea
• Shock, e.g. haemorrhage, burns

Renal Causes
• Nephrotoxins
• Acute tubular necrosis
• Acute cortical necrosis
• Acute glomerulonephritis
• Acute interstitial nephritis
• Vascular lesions

Post-Renal (Obstructive)
• Prostatic hypertrophy
• Calculi
• Pelvic tumours
• Retroperitoneal fibrosis

Others
• Mismatched transfusion (haemoglobinuria)
• Crush injuries (myoglobinuria)

[START_SECTION]Anuria
• Blocked catheter
• Ureteric damage (bilateral)
• Stone in solitary functioning kidney

History
Renal circulatory insufficiency
There will usually be a recent history of a condition which causes renal
hypoperfusion. This may include haemorrhage, burns or dehydration,
e.g. from vomiting, diarrhoea or acute pancreatitis.

Renal causes
In the absence of adequate resuscitation, shock will proceed to cause
damage to the tubules, resulting in acute tubular necrosis. Acute cortical
necrosis may arise as a result of antepartum haemorrhage, eclampsia or
septic abortion. It may also follow insults similar to those that cause
acute tubular necrosis. Vascular lesions may also lead to acute renal
failure; these include renal vein thrombosis, renal artery stenosis and
intravascular coagulation occurring in haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
Other forms of acute renal failure usually present with swelling of the
eyelids, ascites and peripheral oedema. Later, there may be vomiting,
confusion, bruising, gastrointestinal bleeding and eventually fitting and
coma. Volume overload may result in pulmonary oedema. With acute
interstitial nephritis, there may be a history of drug ingestion, e.g.
antibiotics, NSAIDs or diuretics, or there may be a history of infection.
Nephrotoxins may cause acute renal failure and among the drugs
implicated are the aminoglycosides, amphotericin and radiographic
contrast media. Organic solvents, particularly carbon tetrachloride used
in carpet cleaning, may be responsible. Paraquat, snake bites and
mushrooms may also cause acute renal failure.

[START_SECTION]Post-renal
Often the patient will present with complete anuria. This may occur if
there is ureteric damage following surgery or a stone impacted in the
ureter of a solitary functioning kidney. The patient may have a history of
calculous disease or may have recently suffered an attack of ureteric
colic. There may be a history of pelvic tumour or symptoms of prostatic
hypertrophy, e.g. difficulty in starting and a poor stream.
Retroperitoneal fibrosis often develops insidiously.

Others
Oliguria may follow a mismatched transfusion, due to
haemoglobinuria, or crush injuries, due to myoglobinuria. The history
will usually be obvious.

Anuria
Before diagnosing anuria, make sure that the patient does not have a
palpable bladder (if he or she is not catheterised) and is not therefore in
acute retention, or, if the patient is catheterised, that the catheter is not
blocked. As indicated above, anuria is more likely to be a symptom of
an obstructive lesion rather than one of renal hypoperfusion or an
intrinsic renal lesion.

Examination
General
If the patient has a catheter in situ, make sure that it is not blocked. If the
patient does not have a catheter in situ, palpate the lower abdomen for a
distended bladder associated with acute retention. Palpate the abdomen
to exclude swelling of the kidneys and perform a rectal examination to
exclude prostatic hypertrophy.

[START_SECTION]Specific
All causes of oliguria are likely to have some common features on
examination. The patient will be dyspnoeic due to pulmonary oedema
and will either have sacral oedema (if confined to bed) or ankle oedema
(if ambulant). There may be confusion, drowsiness, fitting or coma.
Hypertension and arrhythmias may be present. The patient will be
nauseated, may be vomiting, have hiccups and there may be evidence of
gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Spontaneous bruising may eventually
occur.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ anaemia, renal failure, haemorrhage. WCC ↑ infection. ESR ↑ some
causes of glomerulonephritis.
■ U&Es
Urea ↑, creatinine ↑ in renal and post-renal causes. These may rise in
renal hypoperfusion if not adequately treated.
■ ECG
Arrhythmias. Associated with electrolyte imbalance, e.g.
hyperkalaemia.
■ CXR
Pulmonary oedema. Cardiomegaly.
■ ABGs
Metabolic acidosis.
■ MSU
Red cells, casts and protein in intrinsic renal disease. Hb-positive but no
red blood cells suggests myoglobinuria or haemoglobinuria.

[START_SECTION]Palpitations
Palpitation is an awareness of the heartbeat; although benign in the vast
majority, palpitations are occasionally a manifestation of a lifethreatening disorder.

Causes
Sinus Tachycardia
• Anxiety/emotional stress
• Caffeine
• Nicotine
• Alcohol

Cardiac Arrhythmia
• Premature ventricular contractions (ventricular ectopic
beats)*
• Premature atrial contractions (atrial ectopic beats)*
• Atrial fibrillation* (Fig. 50)
• Supraventricular tachycardia
• Ventricular tachycardia

FIGURE 50 ECG of atrial fibrillation.
The irregularly irregular QRS complexes occur in the setting of a sawtooth baseline of uncoordinated atrial activity.

[START_SECTION]*Indicates causes that tend to present as irregular palpitations.

History
A variety of symptoms is used to describe palpitations and this includes
‘fluttering’, ‘pounding’ and ‘skipping a beat’. Symptoms may also be
experienced in the neck. Important aspects are the frequency, regularity
of palpitation (e.g. fast and irregular) and precipitating factors. Asking
the patient to tap the rate and rhythm of the palpitation (on a table for
example) can be very informative. Arrhythmias associated with
irregular palpitations are listed above.
Knowledge of precipitating factors is important. Palpitations can be a
normal manifestation of anxiety or panic reactions. However, it is
vitally important that an organic cause is excluded as it is common for
anxiety disorders to co-exist in a patient with supraventricular
tachycardia. Exercise is associated with excess catecholamines and also
a precipitator of arrhythmia (supraventricular tachycardia, atrial
fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia usually originating from the
right ventricle). Excessive caffeine, smoking and alcohol intake are also
thought to be precipitators of arrhythmia.
A history of any underlying heart disorder is important, as arrhythmia
is associated with ischaemic heart disease (ventricular arrhythmia),
hypertensive heart disease (atrial fibrillation), heart failure (ventricular
arrhythmia), heart valve disease.
Early age of onset of arrhythmia (childhood or teenage years)
suggests the presence of a congenital abnormality such as a bypass tract
that can lead to supraventricular tachycardia. The reader should consult
a cardiology textbook for further details.

Additional features
Dizziness or syncope (p. 443) is usually associated with serious

[START_SECTION]arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia and occasionally
supraventricular tachycardia.

Examination
Examination during an episode of palpitation is very informative, as
assessment of the rhythm and rate of the pulse can be determined.
Auscultation of the rate at the cardiac apex is more accurate as not all
beats are conducted to the pulse (e.g. in atrial fibrillation).
It is important to measure the blood pressure and screen for any
evidence of underlying structural heart disease, especially mitral valve
prolapse (systolic murmur and a systolic click), as this condition is
associated with supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.

Initial Investigations
12-lead ECG
All patients should have a resting ECG. It is very unlikely that any
arrhythmia can be picked up during this investigation; however,
conditions that predispose to arrhythmia may be diagnosed. The
presence of an accessory pathway (and hence predisposition to
supraventricular arrhythmia) is indicated by a short PR interval (less
than 0.12 seconds).
Also, the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy can indicate
underlying structural heart disease (hypertensive heart disease,
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy). Ischaemic heart disease can
be suggested by Q waves, or ST segment/T wave abnormalities.
Occasionally, atrial or ventricular premature contractions (ectopic
beats) may be evident.

Further Investigations
Further investigations are best reserved for those who are at high risk of
arrhythmia: patients with evidence of underlying structural heart

[START_SECTION]disease, family history of arrhythmia, regular palpitations (especially
during sleep) and dizziness or syncope associated with palpitations.

Ambulatory ECG monitoring
Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring is an excellent method to
detect and identify arrhythmia. Upon further investigation, ventricular
and atrial premature contractions (ectopic beats) are the most
commonly identified arrhythmia. Sinus rhythm is the usual remaining
finding. A serious arrhythmia is detected in approximately 7%. The
reader is advised to consult ECG textbooks for a detailed discussion of
the numerous configurations of each arrhythmia.
• Although palpitations are benign in the vast majority of
cases, they can occasionally be a manifestation of lifethreatening disorders.
• Sudden onset of tachycardia in childhood or teenage years
associated with breathlessness, dizziness and chest pain,
suggests supraventricular tachycardia. Suspect a congenital
anomaly.

[START_SECTION]Penile Lesions
Penile lesions are common. They interfere with sexual intercourse. The
majority of surgical conditions of the penis relate to problems with the
foreskin and glans and the need for circumcision. Carcinoma of the
penis and Peyronie’s disease are rare.

Causes
Foreskin and Glans
• Phimosis
• Paraphimosis
• Balanoposthitis
• Balanitis xerotica obliterans
• Herpes genitalis
• Condylomata (warts)
• Trauma (bite)
• Carcinoma (Fig. 51)
• Erythroplasia of Queyrat
• Chancre (syphilis)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 51 Carcinoma of the penis, revealed with the foreskin retracted.

Shaft of the Penis
• Peyronie’s disease
• Priapism

Urethra
• Epispadias
• Hypospadias

History
Foreskin and glans
Phimosis
In most cases, phimosis is congenital. The foreskin has been tight since
birth and the patient complains that it will not retract over the glans. In
children, this may cause ballooning of the foreskin during micturition,
with resulting balanoposthitis. In adults, the complaint is that it
interferes with sexual intercourse.

Paraphimosis
This is a result of a patient having a phimosis. The foreskin is pulled

[START_SECTION]back over the glans while washing and then is not returned. It may also
occur during sexual intercourse. In hospital practice, it may occur while
the patient is being catheterised and the foreskin is not returned to its
correct place following this procedure. The foreskin forms a tight
constriction around the glans, interfering with venous return and
causing swelling of the glans and foreskin. The patient presents with
considerable pain and a swollen glans penis.

Balanoposthitis
This is inflammation of the glans and foreskin. The patient complains of
an attack of inflammation of the foreskin and glans. It may be associated
with poor hygiene, but in children it is often associated with phimosis
and collection of urine under the foreskin. In diabetics, it is often due to
candida.

Balanitis xerotica obliterans
The patient will complain of thickening and tightening of the foreskin,
and the inability to retract it.

Herpes genitalis
The patient will complain of painful vesicles on the foreskin or glans
penis. There will usually be a history of sexual contact.

Condylomata (warts)
The patient may present with warts on the glans and contiguous surface
of the prepuce. They are usually of venereal origin.

Trauma
There may be a history of trauma, often of an unusual nature. Love bites
may be responsible.

Carcinoma
This usually presents in old age. It is virtually unknown in those who

[START_SECTION]are circumcised. Most patients present with a lump or an ulcer which
may be painful. In uncircumcised patients who cannot retract the
foreskin, there may be a bloodstained purulent discharge from under the
foreskin.

Erythroplasia of Queyrat
The patient will present having noticed a dark, velvety, red, flat patch on
the skin of the glans.

Syphilitic chancre
A chancre presents as a painless, hard ulcer on the penis.

Shaft
Peyronie’s disease
The patient may have noticed a subcutaneous lump along the penis. He
may complain that when he has an erection, the penis appears bent.

Priapism
The patient will present with a persistent painful erection. This is
unassociated with sexual desire. There may be a history of leukaemia,
sickle cell disease, disseminated pelvic malignancy, or the patient may
be on haemodialysis. Priapism may also result from alprostadil
overdose for erectile dysfunction.

Urethra
Epispadias
This is rare. The patient, a baby or child, usually presents with the
urethra opening on the dorsal surface of the glans penis.

Hypospadias
This is more common than epispadias, the patient presenting with the

[START_SECTION]urethral opening on the ventral or undersurface of the penis. In both
epispadias and hypospadias, the patient will complain of a problem
with micturition.

Examination
Foreskin and glans
Phimosis
The foreskin is tight and has a pinhole orifice. It will be impossible to
retract it over the glans penis. There may be associated balanoposthitis.

Paraphimosis
The diagnosis is usually obvious. The glans penis is swollen and
oedematous and there is a deep groove just proximal to the corona
glandis, where there is a tight constricting ring of skin. The patient is
obviously in pain.

Balanoposthitis
There is inflammation of the glans (balanitis) and often associated
inflammation of the foreskin (posthitis). There may be a discharge from
under the foreskin. In the case of candidiasis, there are itchy red patches
on the glans. There may be evidence of poor personal hygiene.

Balanitis xerotica obliterans
The foreskin is thickened, with loss of elasticity and fibrosis. It is
usually not possible to retract it over the glans.

Herpes genitalis
Initially, there will be itchy vesicles but these develop into shallow,
painful erosions. There may be associated painful inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

[START_SECTION]Condylomata (warts)
There will be a bunch of warts, usually around the junction between the
foreskin and the glans and extending onto the glans.

Trauma
Appearance will depend upon the type of trauma. Teeth marks may be
apparent.

Carcinoma
The lesion is usually at the junction of the foreskin and glans. There will
be a lump or ulcer. If there is an ulcer, it will have raised everted edges
and a necrotic base. It feels hard. The inguinal lymph nodes may be
affected, either by metastases or by secondary infection. In patients in
whom the foreskin cannot be retracted, it may be necessary to carry out
circumcision to make the diagnosis.

Erythroplasia of Queyrat
There is a dark-red, flat, velvety, indurated patch on the glans penis. It is
a premalignant condition and represents carcinoma in situ.

Syphilitic chancre
There will be a painless, hard ulcer with a sloping edge. The inguinal
nodes will be enlarged, rubbery, discrete and non-tender.

Shaft
Peyronie’s disease
There are plaques of fibrosis in the corpora cavernosa. These may be felt
as hard lumps along the corpora cavernosa. The patient will volunteer
the information that the penis becomes bent on erection.

Priapism

[START_SECTION]The diagnosis will be obvious, there being a painful erection.

Urethra
The diagnosis of epispadias and hypospadias will be obvious. In
hypospadias, the opening of the urethra may be anywhere along the line
of the urethra, from a few millimetres from the tip of the penis to the
perineum. In epispadias, which is rare, the urethral opening is on the
dorsal surface of the glans penis.

• Always take a full sexual history. Enquire about foreign
travel and sexual encounters. If STD is suspected, refer to a
GUM clinic.
• A persistent solitary ulcer needs thorough investigation as
malignancy is likely.
• Recurrent candidal balanitis may reflect underlying
diabetes. Check the blood sugar.

[START_SECTION]Polyuria
The volume of urine produced per day varies in each individual and is
affected by the amount of fluid intake, physiological requirements and
insensible losses. Polyuria is arbitrarily defined as urine output of more
than three litres in 24 hours.

Causes
Diuretics
Therapeutic
• Frusemide
• Bendrofluazide
• Amiloride

Osmotic
• Hyperglycaemia
• Hypercalcaemia
• Mannitol
• Urea

Diabetes Insipidus
Cranial
• Head injuries
• Neurosurgery
• Brain tumours (especially of pituitary)
• Idiopathic deficiency of ADH production
• Inherited (dominant or recessive)

[START_SECTION]• Pituitary granulomas, e.g. sarcoidosis, TB •
(commoner where TB is endemic)
• Opiates

Nephrogenic
• Drugs
• Lithium
• Demeclocycline
• Hypokalaemia
• Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis
• Recovering acute tubular necrosis
• Recovering obstructive uropathy
• Chronic hypercalcaemia
• Inherited (X-linked)

Excessive Fluid Intake
• Drug-induced thirst – anticholinergics
• Psychogenic
• Hypothalamic disease

History
General
Polyuria is often accompanied by polydipsia, and, as with all waterlosing states, severe thirst is often a side-effect. Frequency of micturition
(frequent passing of small amounts of urine) should be differentiated
from polyuria (frequent passing of large amounts of urine). Diabetes
insipidus may be hereditary and other family members may be affected.

Drug history
A detailed drug history is invaluable, as a significant number of drugs

[START_SECTION]precipitate polyuria by various mechanisms. Therapeutic diuretics are
used in a range of disorders, such as hypertension and cardiac failure.
Opiates inhibit ADH secretion and may produce cranial diabetes
insipidus, whereas drugs such as lithium and demeclocycline may
produce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A side-effect of
anticholinergics is dryness of the mouth; patients may therefore ingest
excessive quantities of water, causing polyuria. Nephrotoxic drugs, such
as aminoglycosides, ciclosporin, NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors, may
precipitate acute tubular necrosis, which can result in severe polyuria in
the recovery phase.

Past medical history
Hyperglycaemia causes an osmotic diuresis, therefore polyuria and
polydipsia are common presenting features of diabetes mellitus.
Malignancy and hyperparathyroidism are common causes of chronic
hypercalcaemia, which can cause polyuria by an intrinsic osmotic effect
or by precipitation of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Cranial diabetes
insipidus can result from severe, blunt head injuries,
craniopharyngiomas, pineal gland tumours or as a transient
postoperative complication following neurosurgery. Renal ischaemia
from conditions such as sepsis and haemorrhage predisposes to acute
tubular necrosis. Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis can result from
reflux nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, gout and multiple
myeloma.

General Investigations
■ Urine dipstick
+++glucose with diabetes mellitus.
■ 24-hour urine collection
>3 litres confirms polyuria and helps differentiate from urinary
frequency.
■ U&Es

[START_SECTION]Plasma urea and creatinine levels ↑ renal failure. Sodium ↑ with
uncompensated polyuria (inadequate water intake). Sodium ↓ with
urea/creatinine ↓ indicates polydipsia as the primary cause. Potassium ↓
may cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
■ Urine and plasma osmolality
Urine osmolality low and plasma osmolality normal in pituitary and
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Urine osmolality low and plasma
osmolality normal to low in compulsive water drinking.
■ Serum calcium
↑ calcium causes osmotic diuresis and chronic tubulointerstitial
nephritis.
■ Serum glucose
↑ diabetes.
The above tests may be all that is required to differentiate between
osmotic diuresis, excess fluid intake and diabetes insipidus. If the
differentiation between primary polydipsia and diabetes insipidus
cannot be made confidently, then proceed with the following two tests.
The reader is advised to consult a reference source regarding the
precautions and safety measures to be observed in the water deprivation
and DDAVP tests.
■ Water deprivation test
Do not perform this test in volume-depleted patients or in the presence
of hypernatraemia.
After overnight water restriction, the plasma osmolality is measured:
Plasma osmolality ↓: primary polydipsia
Plasma osmolality ↑: stop test and measure urine osmolality
Urine osmolality ↑: no diabetes insipidus
Urine osmolality ↓ in three consecutive samples: diabetes insipidus.
■ DDAVP test
Arginine vasopressin is administered:
Urine osmolality ↑: cranial diabetes insipidus
No urine osmolality ↑: nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Specific Investigations

[START_SECTION]■ CT/MRI head
Tumours, hypothalamic disease.
■ Renal biopsy
Acute tubular necrosis, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis.
• Polyuria accompanied by polydipsia is often the first
presentation of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Urgent investigation is required.
• Diabetes mellitus is not the only cause of polyuria
accompanied by thirst. If urinalysis is negative for sugar,
diabetes insipidus or hypercalcaemia are possible diagnoses.

[START_SECTION]Popliteal Swellings
Popliteal swellings are not uncommon. The majority are easily
diagnosed on clinical examination alone.

Causes
Superficial
• Sebaceous cyst
• Lipoma
• Varix of the short saphenous vein

Deep
• Lipoma
• Lymphadenopathy
• Semi-membranosus bursa
• Baker’s cyst
• Popliteal artery aneurysm (Fig. 52)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 52 Femoral angiogram of a patient who presented with a
pulsatile, expansile swelling in the right popliteal fossa.
There is a popliteal aneurysm (arrow).

Bony
• Exostoses
• Osteogenic sarcoma

History
Superficial
Sebaceous cyst
A sebaceous cyst will present as a firm swelling in the skin. It may be
tender if it becomes inflamed and there may be a discharge from it.

Lipoma
This presents as a soft lobulated swelling in the subcutaneous tissue.

Varix of the short saphenous vein
This presents as a soft swelling behind the knee, usually associated with
varicose veins of the short saphenous system.

Deep
Lipoma
Deeper lipomas are difficult to feel because of the tough overlying
fascia. They do not always feel soft and lobulated, as superficial ones do.

Lymphadenopathy
There may be several palpable lumps within the popliteal fossa. The
patient will usually draw attention to a lesion distally, either on the leg

[START_SECTION]or on the foot, usually on the lateral margin of the foot or the back of the
leg. Other groups of nodes may be enlarged.

Semi-membranosus bursa
The patient complains of a swelling behind the knee that interferes with
knee movement, particularly flexion.

Baker’s cyst
A Baker’s cyst is a pulsion diverticulum of the knee joint caused by
chronic disease within the joint. The patient will usually give a history
of a painful knee joint and may have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid
arthritis. Occasionally the cyst ruptures and the patient complains of
severe pain in the calf, which has to be carefully distinguished from
venous thrombosis.

Popliteal artery aneurysm
These often get quite large before they are noticed. The patient may be
aware of a pulsatile swelling behind the knee but often notices it when
crossing the legs, the upper of the crossed limbs moving with each pulse.

Bony
Exostoses
Exostoses may grow in the region of the epiphyseal cartilage of the
femur. There is a well-defined bony swelling in the popliteal fossa.

Osteogenic sarcoma
This may affect either the lower end of the femur or the upper end of the
tibia. There is a diffuse swelling around the knee joint. Pain may be a
presenting symptom. There may also be general malaise and weight
loss. Occasionally pulmonary metastases have occurred at presentation,
and there may be cough and haemoptysis.

[START_SECTION]Examination
Superficial
Sebaceous cyst
There will be a small, well-defined swelling in the skin with a punctum.
If it is infected, the surrounding skin will be red and there may be
discharge.

Lipoma
There will be a soft, lobulated swelling in the popliteal fossa.

Varix of the short saphenous vein
This is not uncommon. There will be a soft, compressible dilatation at
the termination of the short saphenous vein. There may be an expansile
cough impulse. A fluid thrill will be palpable when the short saphenous
vein lower down the leg is tapped.

Deep
Lipoma
A deep lipoma in the fat of the popliteal fossa may be difficult to define
accurately. It does not always have the soft, lobulated appearance of a
more superficial lipoma.

Lymphadenopathy
There may be a number of discrete glands palpable or they may be firm
and matted together. Check for a lesion distally on the leg or foot, e.g.
malignant melanoma. Check for lymphadenopathy elsewhere.

Semi-membranosus bursa
The swelling lies above the level of the knee joint line, slightly to the
medial side of the popliteal fossa. It tends to be firm in consistency and
transilluminates.

[START_SECTION]Baker’s cyst
Baker’s cysts occur more often in elderly patients with longstanding
arthritis or in younger patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The lump is
below the level of the knee joint and deep to gastrocnemius. It may
transilluminate. Pressure over the lump may reduce it into the knee joint.
Examination of the knee joint reveals changes consistent with arthritis,
i.e. limited movements, crepitus and occasionally an effusion.

Popliteal artery aneurysm
An expansile, pulsatile mass will be palpable in the popliteal fossa. They
are often bilateral. Check the distal circulation. Popliteal aneurysms
may thrombose with distal ischaemia, or may throw off small emboli
causing ischaemic toes or ischaemic ulcers on the tips of the toes.
Palpate the abdomen: there is an association between popliteal
aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Bony
Exostoses
A bony mass may be felt in the popliteal fossa.

Osteogenic sarcoma
The overlying skin may be reddened, with dilated subcutaneous veins.
There may be tenderness. The swelling is usually smooth until it spreads
into the surrounding tissues, when it becomes irregular. The swelling
feels firm but is not usually bony hard.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ lymphadenopathy, e.g. part of generalised lymphadenopathy
associated with reticulosis. WCC ↑ reticulosis. ESR ↑ reticulosis,
osteogenic sarcoma with secondaries.

[START_SECTION]■ US
Lipoma. Semi-membranosus bursa. Baker’s cyst. Popliteal artery
aneurysm.
■ Knee X-ray
Exostoses. Osteoarthritis (Baker’s cyst). Rheumatoid arthritis (Baker’s
cyst). Osteogenic sarcoma – bone destruction, grows out of cortex,
elevating periosteum with reposition of subperiosteal bone (Codman’s
triangle), radiating spicules of bone (‘sunray’ spicules).
■ CXR
Secondary deposits from osteogenic sarcoma. Hilar lymph nodes with
generalised lymphadenopathy.

Specific Investigations
■ Duplex Doppler
Varix of short saphenous vein. Popliteal artery aneurysm.
■ CT
Shows invasion of osteogenic sarcoma. Lung secondaries.
■ MRI
Baker’s cyst. Bone tumour.
■ Arteriography
Popliteal aneurysm. Distal circulation.
• There is an association between popliteal artery aneurysms
and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Always examine the
abdomen.
• If the lump is thought to be a gland, always examine the sole
of the foot, between the toes and under the toenails to exclude
a primary lesion, e.g. melanoma.
• Vague generalised swelling around the knee in a young
patient may suggest an osteogenic sarcoma.

[START_SECTION]Pruritus
Pruritus is itching of the skin. There are a vast number of dermatological
causes of pruritus, which are usually visible on inspection. The
following are causes of generalised pruritus in the absence of skin
disease. A description of dermatological disorders is beyond the scope
of this book.

Causes
• Obstructive jaundice
• Chronic renal failure

Haematological Disease
• Iron deficiency
• Polycythaemia

Internal Malignancy
• Bronchial carcinoma
• Hodgkin’s disease

Endocrine Disease
• Hyperthyroidism
• Hypothyroidism
• Diabetes mellitus

Drugs
• Oral contraceptive pill (cholestasis)
• Opiates (histamine release)
• Alcohol and drug withdrawal

[START_SECTION]History
When approaching a patient with generalised pruritus, enquiries are
made regarding the site and duration of symptoms. Occasionally the
onset of pruritus will correlate with the initiation of drug treatment,
allowing you to exclude the offending medication. It may also occur as a
side-effect of alcohol or drug withdrawal. Pruritus after a hot bath
classically occurs with polycythaemia. Iron deficiency, even in the
absence of anaemia, can cause pruritus; therefore symptoms of blood
loss in each system should be carefully elicited.
Haemoptysis, chronic cough and weight loss in smokers may be due
to underlying bronchial carcinoma, which is an important subgroup of
internal malignancies that present with pruritus. The presence of
localised lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats and weight loss should
lead to the consideration of Hodgkin’s disease. Patients with obstructive
jaundice (p. 256) may present with pruritus (due to the accumulation of
bile salts), even while the jaundice is not clinically apparent. With
complete obstruction, patients may notice pale stools and dark urine.
Lethargy, anorexia, nocturia, oliguria, polyuria, haematuria, frothy
urine from proteinuria, skin fragility, oedema and bone pains are some
of the multisystemic features suggestive of chronic renal disease.
Interestingly, pruritus seldom occurs with acute renal failure.
As pruritus may be due to thyroid disease, clinical assessment of the
thyroid status is an important aspect of the history. Features of
hyperthyroidism are tremor, heat intolerance, palpitations, increased
appetite with weight loss, anxiety and diarrhoea. Features of
hypothyroidism are cold intolerance, mental slowing, weight gain,
constipation and menorrhagia.

Examination

[START_SECTION]Inspection
Wide, staring eyes with lid lag and tremor may be present with
thyrotoxicosis. Pallor of the conjunctivae may be evident in severe
anaemia, whereas, with polycythaemia, conjunctival insufflation and
facial plethora occur. The sclera should also be examined for the
presence of jaundice. Sallow skin with easy bruising and uraemic frost
may be seen with chronic renal failure. Spoon-shaped nails of iron
deficiency may be accompanied by angular cheilitis. Clubbing may be
due to bronchial carcinoma.

General Examination
Asymmetrical, non-tender, localised lymphadenopathy in the absence of
infection is suggestive of Hodgkin’s disease. The thyroid gland is
palpated for abnormalities, such as enlargement, nodularity and
asymmetry. A respiratory examination is performed; features of
bronchial carcinoma include monophonic inspiratory wheeze (partial
endoluminal bronchial obstruction), lobar collapse of the lung, pleural
effusion and Horner’s syndrome with apical lung tumours. Chest wall
tenderness may also occur as a result of tumour infiltration.
Splenomegaly may occur with Hodgkin’s disease and polycythaemia
rubra vera.

General Investigations
■ Urine dipstick
Protein and blood with renal disease.
■ FBC and blood film
Microcytic hypochromic anaemia with iron deficiency, normochromic
normocytic anaemia with Hodgkin’s, ↑ Hb with polycythaemia.
■ U&Es
Urea and creatinine ↑ renal failure.
■ Glucose
↑ with diabetes mellitus.

[START_SECTION]■ LFTs
Bilirubin ↑, alkaline phosphatase ↑ with obstructive jaundice.
■ TFTs
TSH ↓ and T4 ↑ thyrotoxicosis; TSH ↑ and T4 ↓ hypothyroidism.
■ CXR
Bronchial carcinoma, hilar lymphadenopathy with Hodgkin’s disease.

Specific Investigations
■ Excisional biopsy of lymph node
Hodgkin’s disease: Reed–Sternberg cells.
■ US abdomen
Dilated bile ducts with obstructive jaundice, the site and cause of
obstruction may be visualised. The size of the kidneys may be decreased
with chronic renal disease, and multiple cysts visible with polycystic
kidney disease.
■ Serum iron, serum ferritin, protoporphyrin
Serum iron ↓, serum ferritin ↓, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin ↑ iron
deficiency.
■ CT chest and abdomen
Hilar lymphadenopathy in lymphoma. Chest lesion in bronchial
carcinoma.
• Persistent pruritus may be the presenting symptom of
lymphoma or other malignancy. Always examine the
abdomen and lymph nodes.

[START_SECTION]Pruritus Ani
Pruritus ani is itching around the anal canal. It is a common symptom
and in approximately half of the cases, no cause can be found.

Causes
Anal Discharge
• Haemorrhoids
• Fistula-in-ano
• Skin tags
• Warts (Fig. 53)
• Carcinoma
• Polyps
• Gonococcal proctitis

FIGURE 53 Anal warts (condylomata acuminata).

[START_SECTION]Faecal Soiling
• Incontinence
• Poor hygiene
• Diarrhoea

Skin Disease
• Candidiasis
• Tinea cruris
• Lichen sclerosus
• Contact dermatitis
• Scabies
• Psoriasis
• Eczema

Parasites
• Threadworms

Psychogenic
• Anxiety

History
Anal discharge
Any cause within the anus or lower rectum that produces moisture and
sogginess of the anal skin may cause pruritus ani. Patients may
volunteer the information that they have haemorrhoids or perianal
warts. They may have noticed an anal discharge, which soils the
underwear. Check for a history of anal sexual exposure.

Faecal soiling
The patient may complain of incontinence. This may be associated with

[START_SECTION]poor hygiene. Chronic diarrhoea may be responsible. There may be an
underlying cause for the chronic diarrhoea, e.g. colitis or Crohn’s
disease. Excessive sweating in hot weather may be associated with
pruritus ani.

Skin diseases
If the patient is diabetic or immunosuppressed, candidiasis may be
responsible. Recent oral antibiotic therapy may result in candidiasis.
Check whether the patient has an itchy rash anywhere else. This may be
particularly so with scabies or eczema. Contact dermatitis may result
from the use of deodorants or a change in washing powder for the
underwear. Psoriasis is not usually itchy but sometimes considerable
itching occurs, especially if the area becomes infected. Lichen sclerosus
is uncommon, occurring chiefly in women, when it may involve both the
vulva and the perineum. In men, this may be associated with balanitis
xerotica obliterans, so enquire if there is any abnormality of the
foreskin.

Parasites
Threadworms usually occur in children. The parents may have noticed
them.

Psychogenic
Idiopathic pruritus may occur in people with anxiety states. An itchscratch cycle may occur, which is difficult to break.

Examination
Anal discharge
Inspection of the anus may show skin tags, the external opening of a
fistula-in-ano, perianal warts or haemorrhoids. Digital rectal

[START_SECTION]examination may reveal a carcinoma of the anal canal or fibrous anal
polyps. Proctoscopy and sigmoidoscopy will confirm any associated
anal or rectal lesion. Take a swab if purulent discharge.

Faecal soiling
Soiling of the underwear may be apparent. General poor hygiene may
also be apparent in the patient. Carry out a digital rectal examination to
check for sphincteric tone.

Skin diseases
Candidiasis may occur in those on long-term antibiotics, diabetics and
the immunosuppressed. Tinea cruris is more common in men. The
infection often involves the groin and perineum in addition to the
perianal areas. The patient may also have co-existing tinea pedis. With
lichen sclerosus, there are well-defined plaques of superficial atrophy of
the epidermis with a whitish colour. In the male, check the penis for
balanitis xerotica obliterans. With contact dermatitis, there may be
changes in the skin in other areas apart from the perianal area. With
scabies, there are usually lesions on other parts of the body. Burrows 5–
10 mm deep appear as long ridges, which may be ‘S’-shaped. Isolation of
the organism with a pin and examination under the microscope will
confirm the diagnosis. With psoriasis there will usually be lesions on
other areas of the body, and this will also be so with eczema.

Parasites
Threadworms may be visible around the anus.

Psychogenic
There may be an obvious history of psychiatric illness or the patient
may appear anxious or depressed.

[START_SECTION]General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
These are usually normal.
■ Urinalysis
Positive for sugar – diabetic.
■ Blood glucose
Diabetic.
■ Stool culture
Ova, parasites and cysts, cause of diarrhoea.
■ Anal swab
Gram stain – Gram-negative intracellular diplococci in gonorrhoea.
■ Skin scrapings
For mycotic infection, microscopy and culture.
■ Nocturnal ‘Sellotape swab’
Threadworms.
■ Biopsy
Anal carcinoma. Lichen sclerosus.
• Always perform a digital rectal examination.
• Perianal candidiasis suggests diabetes. Check the blood
sugar.
• Perianal warts imply an STD. Refer to a GUM clinic.
• Always take a full sexual history, including unusual sexual
practices.
• Suspicious anal lesions should be biopsied to exclude anal
cancer.

[START_SECTION]Pyrexia of Unknown Origin
Most pyrexias result from a clearly defined illness, e.g. acute
pyelonephritis or acute appendicitis, or from self-limiting viral
infections, e.g. common cold. Pyrexia of unknown origin is defined as a
temperature>38.3°C on several occasions, accompanied by more than
three weeks of illness and failure to reach a diagnosis after one week of
inpatient investigation. Most cases of pyrexia of unknown origin are
unusual presentations of common diseases, e.g. tuberculosis,
endocarditis, rather than rare or exotic illnesses.

Causes
Bacterial
• Abscess, e.g. subphrenic, pelvic
• Subacute bacterial endocarditis
• TB
• Brucellosis
• Typhoid
• Leptospirosis
• Q fever
• Cat scratch disease

Viral
• Influenza
• Glandular fever
• HIV
• CMV

[START_SECTION]Fungal
• Candidiasis
• Aspergillosis
• Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly carinii)

Protozoal
• Malaria • (common in Africa)
• Amoebiasis
• Toxoplasmosis

Neoplasia
• Hypernephroma
• Lymphoma
• Hepatoma
• Acute leukaemia

Connective Tissue Disease
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• SLE
• Polyarteritis nodosa and other vasculitis
• Temporal arteritis

Granulomatous Disease
• Crohn’s disease
• Sarcoidosis

Others
• Myocardial infarction
• Post-immunisation
• Drug induced
• Pulmonary embolism
• Familial Mediterranean fever
• Munchausen’s disease (factitious)

[START_SECTION]History
A full and extensive history should be taken, noting especially travel
abroad, contact with infection, contact with animals, bites, abrasions,
rashes, diarrhoea. Check the drug history, including non-prescription
drugs and drug abuse. Check for any recent history of surgery,
particularly abdominal surgery. Is there any history of recent
immunisations? Has the patient experienced night sweats, weight loss
and general malaise?

Examination
A full physical examination should be carried out. This should be
directed at every system of the body, checking particularly for
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Rectal and vaginal
examination should be carried out.

Investigations
It may be necessary to carry out numerous and repeated investigations.
It may also be necessary to withhold any drugs one at a time, to see if
the temperature settles.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ malignancy, anaemia of chronic disease, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis.
WCC ↑ infection, leukaemia. Lymphocytes ↑ viral infection. Platelets ↓
leukaemia. ESR ↑ malignancy, connective tissue disease, TB.
■ U&Es
Connective tissue disease affecting the kidneys.
■ LFTs
Biliary tract or liver disease, e.g. cholangitis, hepatitis.
■ Blood glucose
Diabetes – infections are more common in diabetics.

[START_SECTION]■ Blood culture
Streptococcus viridans suggests infective endocarditis. Isolation of
coliforms suggests the possibility of intra-abdominal sepsis.
■ Viral antibodies

■ Sputum culture
Microscopy for tubercle bacilli and C&S.
■ Urine microscopy and culture
Microscopic haematuria in endocarditis. Haematuria in hypernephroma

• Pyrexia of unknown origin presents a diagnostic challenge.
Clinical signs are often non-specific and may fluctuate in
severity and alter with chronicity.
• Empirical treatment is not advocated in cases of pyrexia of
unknown origin with the following exceptions: cases meeting
the criteria for culture-negative endocarditis; cases suggestive
of cryptic disseminated TB and cases in which temporal
arteritis is suspected.

[START_SECTION]Rectal Bleeding
Rectal bleeding is a common symptom. The majority of patients with
rectal bleeding have a simple condition such as haemorrhoids, but the
symptoms should always be taken seriously and investigated. Rectal
bleeding with a change in bowel habit and colicky abdominal pain
should be regarded as due to colorectal cancer until proved otherwise.

Causes
Anus
• Haemorrhoids
• Fissure-in-ano
• Carcinoma
• Trauma

Colon and Rectum
• Carcinoma (Fig. 54)
• Polyps
• Diverticular disease
• Inflammatory bowel disease
• Ulcerative colitis
• Crohn’s disease
• Ischaemic colitis
• Rectal prolapse
• Angiodysplasia
• Irradiation colitis or proctitis
• Solitary rectal ulcer

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 54 Carcinoma of the rectum.

Upper Gastrointestinal Tract
• Massive haemorrhage, e.g. duodenal ulcer

Others

• Bleeding diatheses
• Uraemia

History
Anus

[START_SECTION]Haemorrhoids
Piles occur at any age. Bleeding from piles is noted either on the toilet
paper or as splashes in the toilet after defecation. Uncomplicated piles
are not painful.

Fissure-in-ano
Fissure-in-ano is most common under the age of 40 years. It is quite
common in children. The patient experiences pain on defecation, which
may persist for minutes or hours afterwards. Constipation is usually a
precipitating cause, the constipation being made worse by the fissure as
the patient avoids defecation because of pain. Blood is noticed on the
toilet paper or streaked on the stool.

Carcinoma of the anal canal
Carcinoma of the anal canal usually occurs in the elderly. It presents
with pain on defecation and streaking of blood on the stools and blood
on the toilet paper. Initially, in the early stages, it may be mistaken for a
fissure-in-ano.

Trauma
There may be a history of a penetrating injury to the anal canal. Sexual
abuse or homosexual practices may be relevant.

Colorectal
Carcinoma
With colonic carcinoma, the blood may be mixed with the stool. There is
usually a history of accompanying change in bowel habit and colicky
abdominal pain. With rectal cancer, the blood is usually streaked on the
stool and there may be a history of tenesmus, i.e. a sense of incomplete
evacuation of the rectum.

Polyps

[START_SECTION]The history may be similar to that of carcinoma.

Diverticular disease
Bleeding associated with diverticular disease is typically acute, massive
and fresh. There may be a past history of diverticular disease.

Inflammatory bowel disease
With ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, there is often sudden onset
of diarrhoea with watery, brown motions containing mucus and fresh
blood. There is usually colicky abdominal pain. With ulcerative
proctitis, the patient may complain of tenesmus.

Ischaemic colitis
This usually occurs in the elderly. There is colicky abdominal pain
associated with the passage of dark-red venous blood PR.

Angiodysplasia
The patient is usually elderly. There is bleeding PR, which may be
torrential but is more often repeated small bleeds.

Irradiation proctitis or colitis
There will be a history of irradiation, often for carcinoma of the cervix.
The patient passes blood and mucus PR and complains of tenesmus.

Rectal prolapse
The patient will be aware of something hanging out of the back passage
that comes down on defecation. Bleeding is due to trauma.

Solitary rectal ulcer
Bleeding occurs after defecation, usually in small volumes. This may be
associated with mucus discharge and a feeling of a lump in the anus.

[START_SECTION]Small bowel
Meckel’s diverticulum
This usually results in painless bleeding in young adults. The blood
tends to be dark red and may on occasions have the characteristics of
melaena.

Intussusception
This usually occurs in infants, but may rarely occur at any age. The
child has colicky abdominal pain and draws the legs up, screams and
passes a stool consisting of mixed blood and mucus (‘redcurrant jelly’
stool).

Mesenteric infarction
The patient is usually elderly, or a younger patient who has a history of
heart disease (embolism). The patient develops severe central
abdominal, colicky pain associated with diffuse tenderness and later
collapse and shock.

Aortoenteric fistula
This usually occurs following repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm
with a Dacron graft. The Dacron graft becomes infected, the fistula
forms between the aorta and duodenum. Depending on the speed of the
bleed, there may be either melaena or profuse red rectal haemorrhage
with shock.

Upper gastrointestinal tract
Massive haemorrhage from the upper gastrointestinal tract, e.g.
bleeding oesophageal varices, duodenal ulcer, may present with brightred bleeding PR. This is due to extremely fast intestinal transit and the
patient will always be shocked.

Others

[START_SECTION]Check for a history of anticoagulants. The patient may have a bleeding
disorder. Check for bleeding from other sites or spontaneous bruising.

Uraemia
Rectal bleeding may occur in uraemia and this may be related to a
platelet defect. Rarely, rectal bleeding may occur with collagen diseases,
particularly polyarteritis nodosa.

Examination
Anus
Haemorrhoids
There may be obvious prolapsed haemorrhoids; however,
sigmoidoscopy and proctoscopy are usually required to make the
diagnosis.

Fissure-in-ano
Separate the buttocks. A chronic fissure-in-ano with a sentinel pile may
be seen in the midline posteriorly, or more rarely, in the midline
anteriorly. Digital rectal examination, if attempted, will be extremely
painful.

Carcinoma
This may show a hard ulcer in the anal canal with everted edges;
however, in the early stages, carcinoma of the anal canal may be
difficult to distinguish from a chronic fissure-in-ano. Biopsy should be
undertaken.

Trauma
Bruising may be apparent around the anal canal. There may be a split in
the skin or mucosa. Digital rectal examination will be painful.

[START_SECTION]Colon and rectum
Carcinoma
An abdominal mass may be palpable. There may be signs of intestinal
obstruction. Digital rectal examination may reveal a hard, irregular,
ulcerating mass.

Polyps
A polyp may be palpable in the rectum. There may be no findings on
physical examination.

Diverticular disease
The patient may be tender in the left iliac fossa. Often, there are no
abdominal findings.

Inflammatory bowel disease
There may be a palpable abdominal mass with Crohn’s disease. There
may be localised abdominal tenderness. If toxic dilatation has occurred,
the abdomen will be distended and tender, and there may be signs of
peritonitis if perforation has occurred.

Ischaemic colitis
Physical examination may show left-sided abdominal tenderness and
the patient may be shocked.

Angiodysplasia
There may be little to find other than rectal bleeding. There are usually
no abdominal signs.

Irradiation colitis or proctitis
There may be some abdominal tenderness. Digital rectal examination
will reveal a granular mucosa and blood on the glove.

[START_SECTION]Rectal prolapse
There will be obvious prolapse of the rectum with ulcerated, bleeding
rectal mucosa.

Solitary rectal ulcer
There are no abdominal findings. Digital rectal examination may give
the impression of a polypoid swelling just inside the rectum, which may
be mistaken for carcinoma. Proctoscopy will reveal redness and oedema
of the mucosa and, in about 50% of patients, frank ulceration will be
noted.

Small bowel
Meckel’s diverticulum
There will usually be nothing to find on abdominal examination.

Intussusception
A mass may be palpable in the right iliac fossa. Eventually, as the
intussusception proceeds, the right iliac fossa becomes ‘empty’.

Mesenteric infarction
The patient may be in atrial fibrillation and this suggests embolism.
There will be diffuse abdominal tenderness, later accompanied by
collapse and shock.

Aortoenteric fistula
There will usually be the long midline scar of a recent aortic aneurysm
repair. Otherwise, there will be little to find on abdominal examination.

Upper gastrointestinal tract
Massive haemorrhage
There may be signs of liver failure associated with a massive bleed from

[START_SECTION]varices. There may be epigastric tenderness associated with duodenal
ulceration.

Others
With anticoagulants there may be bleeding from other orifices, as may
also occur with bleeding diatheses. Look for signs of bruising. Uraemic
bleeding is often seen in patients with established uraemia and they may
already be on dialysis and have an arteriovenous fistula or a CAPD tube
in situ. Rectal bleeding from collagen diseases is rare. Polyarteritis
nodosa is probably the most common. Bleeding is due to necrotising
vasculitis and there may be signs of vasculitis elsewhere, e.g. skin.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ may occur in almost any type of rectal bleeding. WCC ↑
inflammatory bowel disease, ischaemic colitis, aortoenteric fistula.
Platelets ↓ in bleeding diatheses. ESR ↑ carcinoma, collagen disease.
■ U&Es
Urea and creatinine raised with uraemic bleeding. The urea may be
raised due to absorption of blood from the bowel. Usually in this case,
the creatinine is normal.

cause, always consider non-accidental injury.

[START_SECTION]Scalp Lesions
Lesions on the scalp are common; the most common are sebaceous
cysts, which are often multiple.

Causes
Traumatic
• Haematoma
• Cephalhaematoma

Cystic
• Sebaceous cysts (epidermal cysts) (Fig. 55)

FIGURE 55 A large epidermal cyst (sebaceous cyst) of the scalp.

[START_SECTION]Neoplastic
Benign
• Ivory osteoma

Malignant
Primary
• Basal cell carcinoma
• Squamous cell carcinoma
• Malignant melanoma
• Leukaemia
• Myeloma
Secondary
• Breast
• Bronchus
• Thyroid
• Prostate
• Kidney

Infective
• Tinea capitis
• Cock’s peculiar tumour

Other
• Psoriasis
• Seborrhoeic dermatitis

History
Traumatic
Check for a history of trauma. A boggy haematoma may overlie a skull
fracture. A cephalhaematoma is seen in a newborn baby. It follows a

[START_SECTION]traumatic delivery. The haematoma is below the periosteum of the skull.

Sebaceous cyst
These may be multiple. The patient usually notices them when combing
the hair.

Neoplastic
With an ivory osteoma, the patient may notice a rock-hard swelling on
the scalp. The patient is usually a young adult and is asymptomatic.
Malignant ulcers may occur on the scalp. The patient will notice a lesion
when combing the hair and bleeding may occur. These lesions present
earlier in bald patients. Bony tenderness and swelling may be a
presenting symptom of secondary deposits. There may be a history of a
primary, or a careful history must be taken to establish the site of a
primary.

Infective
With Cock’s peculiar tumour, the patient may notice a sore, bleeding
lesion on the scalp. Cock’s peculiar tumour is due to a sebaceous cyst
suppurating and granulation tissue appearing on its surface. It may be
mistaken for a squamous cell carcinoma. Tinea capitis usually occurs in
childhood. There is an itchy, red, scaly patch on the scalp and the hairs
break easily, leaving patches of stubble.

Other
Psoriasis may affect the scalp. There is usually a history of lesions
elsewhere on the body. Seborrhoeic dermatitis presents with a fine,
scaly rash on the scalp. Hair growth is usually normal with both these
lesions.

Examination

[START_SECTION]Examination
Traumatic
A knock on the head may cause a boggy haematoma. X-ray is required
to exclude an underlying fracture. Cephalhaematoma occurs in the
newborn; the haematoma spreads beneath the periosteum of the skull
and is therefore limited by the skull suture lines.

Sebaceous cyst
Sebaceous cysts are spherical, tender, firm swellings in the scalp. They
may be multiple. Rarely is a punctum visible with sebaceous cysts on
the scalp.

Neoplastic
An ivory osteoma is a bony, hard, smooth swelling, arising from the
outer table of the skull. The skin is freely mobile over it. A squamous
cell carcinoma presents as an ulcer with a hard, everted edge. A
malignant melanoma is usually pigmented, ulcerated and bleeds. In both
these conditions, cervical lymphadenopathy may be present. A basal cell
carcinoma is a raised ulcer with a rolled edge with a pearly appearance,
often with superficial telangiectasia. Lesions in the skull may be
secondaries from lung, breast, thyroid, prostate and kidney. Each of
these areas should be examined for a possible primary. Myeloma may
present with painful lesions in the skull. There may be areas of localised
tenderness.

Infective
Cock’s peculiar tumour presents as an open, granulating sebaceous cyst.
It appears angry and swollen and may be mistaken for a squamous cell
carcinoma. In tinea capitis, there are red, scaly patches on the scalp,
with broken hairs giving a stubbled appearance.

[START_SECTION]Other
With psoriasis, there are well-demarcated areas of scales heaped up over
red plaque. The hair grows normally through the plaques. Check for
psoriatic lesions elsewhere. Seborrhoeic dermatitis shows fine scales
but the hairs remain intact.

General Investigations
The diagnosis of most of these lesions is made on clinical examination
alone.
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ malignancy. WCC ↑ leukaemia. ESR ↑ myeloma and other
malignancies.
■ CXR
Primary tumour. Secondary malignancy, e.g. secondaries from
malignant melanoma.
■ Skull X-ray
Fracture. Ivory osteoma. Pepper-pot skull – myeloma. Secondary
deposits – osteolytic from lung, breast and thyroid. Osteosclerotic from
prostate and occasionally kidney.

Specific Investigations
■ Serum protein electrophoresis
Monoclonal gammopathy with myeloma.
■ Bone scan
Bony secondaries.
■ Scalp scrapings
Fungal infection, e.g. tinea capitis.
■ Biopsy
Malignant lesions. Cock’s peculiar tumour.
• The scalp is a common site of tumour, especially in elderly,
bald men and those with outside occupations. Biopsy is

[START_SECTION]essential to confirm the diagnosis.

[START_SECTION]Scrotal Pain
This may be due to lesions on the scrotal skin, within the scrotum, or
may, rarely, be due to referred pain.

Causes
Skin
• Infected sebaceous cyst
• Irritation (urine/faeces in the incontinent)
• Dermatitis
• Herpes simplex
• Behçet’s disease
• Fournier’s gangrene (Fig. 56)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 56 Fournier’s scrotal gangrene.
This 64-year-old diabetic presented with scrotal pain and high pyrexia.
Within a few hours of admission, black necrotic areas appeared on the
scrotum. Treatment was with antibiotics, wide excision of all necrotic
tissue, the wound being left open to heal by second intention.

Internal Scrotal Swellings
• Strangulated hernia
• Testicular torsion
• Epididymo-orchitis
• Torsion of testicular appendage
• Haematocele
• Varicocele

Referred
• Groin strain
• Ilioinguinal nerve entrapment after hernia repair
• Idiopathic cord neuralgia
• Spinal nerve irritation

History
Skin
The patient may have noticed a skin lesion, which is itchy, sore or
painful. In the elderly, confused and incontinent, pain and soreness may
be due to the irritant effect of faeces and urine with superadded
infection. Previous history of a superficial swelling may suggest an
infected sebaceous cyst. There may be a history to suggest contact
dermatitis. Painful vesicular lesions may suggest herpes. Behçet’s
syndrome may cause painful ulcerative lesions of the scrotum and the
patient may also have similar lesions on the penis. Fournier’s gangrene
usually has acute onset in a young, healthy male with rapid progression
to gangrene of the skin. There is often absence of a discernible cause.

[START_SECTION]Internal scrotal swellings
There may be a previous history of an inguinal hernia descending into
the scrotum. Sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and irreducibility
may suggest the development of a strangulated inguinal hernia. Sudden
onset of pain, redness and swelling in a teenager or young male suggests
a diagnosis of testicular torsion. This may come on during vigorous
exercise. This is a surgical emergency and needs urgent surgery.
Gradual onset of pain, redness and tenderness will suggest epididymoorchitis. Check for symptoms of urinary tract infection, e.g. dysuria or
frequency, which may accompany epididymo-orchitis. Orchitis may be
associated with mumps and this may be apparent, the patient
complaining of bilateral painful parotid and submandibular glands,
together with painful cervical lymphadenopathy and constitutional
illness. A history of trauma will suggest haematocele. A dull ache, often
poorly localised, may be associated with a varicocele.

Referred pain
Rarely, the patient may complain of pain in the scrotum, with no visible
or palpable abnormality. Check for a history of previous inguinal hernia
repair, which may have resulted in ilioinguinal nerve entrapment.
Idiopathic cord neuralgia may occur but is rare. Occasionally ‘groin
strain’ may cause scrotal pain. Referred pain from spinal lesions may
rarely cause scrotal pain.

Examination
Skin
A red, scaly lesion will suggest dermatitis. There may be superadded
infection. In the elderly and incontinent, the diagnosis of irritation from
urine or faeces will usually be apparent. An infected sebaceous cyst will
present as a localised, tender, red swelling on the scrotum. There may be
purulent discharge. Herpes simplex will present with vesicular lesions.

[START_SECTION]They may be present elsewhere, e.g. on the penis. Behçet’s disease will
present with painful ulcerative lesions on the scrotum as well as on the
penis. There may be other signs of Behçet’s disease, e.g. arthritis,
keratitis, iritis, mouth ulcers. With Fournier’s gangrene, there is usually
a tense, glossy oedema developing over the scrotum. Crepitations
develop later before subcutaneous gangrene occurs. The gangrene may
spread over the inguinal area and the lower abdominal wall. In the
advanced case, the skin will have completely disappeared, leaving the
testes hanging naked in the scrotum.

Internal scrotal swellings
There may be a tense, tender scrotal mass, which it is impossible to ‘get
above’. This would suggest a strangulated hernia. The presence of an
enlarged tender testicle drawn up towards the groin suggests testicular
torsion. An enlarged tender testis with redness and scrotal oedema
suggests epididymo-orchitis. The parotid and submandibular glands
should be checked to exclude mumps. Occasionally, torsion of a
testicular appendage may occur and cause pain and scrotal swelling out
of all proportion to the size of the lesion, which may be less than a few
millimetres in diameter. A tender swelling with scrotal bruising and
oedema following trauma will suggest a haematocele (a collection of
blood between the layers of the tunica vaginalis). A varicocele may not
be obvious until the patient has been standing up for 10–15 seconds.
Classically, it feels like a ‘bag of worms’ with the warm blood filling
dilated veins, which are palpable through the scrotal skin. It is more
common on the left-hand side. Rapid onset of a left-sided varicocele may
be associated with carcinoma of the left kidney, the tumour growing
down the left renal vein and obstructing the left testicular vein. Examine
the abdomen for a left renal mass.

Referred pain
Check for the scar of an inguinal hernia repair. In ilioinguinal nerve
entrapment, there will be anaesthesia/paraesthesia below the scar and

[START_SECTION]on the anterior aspect of the scrotal skin. In the rare case where scrotal
pain may be referred from a spinal lesion, a full neurological
examination should be carried out. Examine the lumbosacral spine for
localised tenderness.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
WCC ↑ infection. ESR ↑ infection, tumour.
■ US
Testicular lesion. Haematocele.
■ MSU
Urinary tract infection associated with epididymo-orchitis.
■ Swab
Ulcer, C&S.

Specific Investigations
■ Lumbosacral spine X-ray
Referred pain due to degenerative disease or metastases.
■ Laser Doppler
Check for testicular blood flow. Absent in testicular torsion.
■ Technetium scan
Testicular torsion (no outline of testis) versus epididymo-orchitis (good
testicular blood flow).
■ US abdomen
Left renal carcinoma (varicocele).
■ MRI
Spinal lesion.
■ Surgery
Diagnostic between torsion and infection. There is rarely the time or
equipment to carry out laser Doppler or a technetium scan. If a testicular
torsion is not dealt with within six hours of onset, there is likely to be
permanent damage to the testis. If there is any doubt in the diagnosis,

[START_SECTION]assume that it is torsion and explore the scrotum surgically.
• It is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between
torsion and epididymo-orchitis. Urgent referral and surgical
exploration is required.

[START_SECTION]Scrotal Swellings
Scrotal swellings are a common presenting complaint in the outpatient
clinic. They are also therefore common in clinical examinations. It is
important to be able to make a rapid diagnosis of testicular torsion and
take appropriate action, i.e. surgery. It is also important to distinguish
between those swellings that have underlying serious pathology
(testicular tumour) and those that are simple and benign (epididymal
cysts).

Causes
• Sebaceous cyst
• Indirect inguinal hernia
• Hydrocele
• Epididymal cyst (spermatocele) (Fig. 57)
• Epididymo-orchitis
• Testicular torsion
• Testicular tumour
• Varicocele
• Haematocele
• Sperm granuloma
• TB • (common where TB is endemic)
• Gumma

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 57 Epididymal cyst.
The swelling is being transilluminated. A 3 cm soft rounded swelling of
the upper pole of epididymis can be seen. The fact that it transilluminates
confirms the presence of an epididymal cyst containing clear fluid. A
spermatocele, because of its opaque contents, does not transilluminate.

History
Sebaceous cyst
The patient may complain of several painful lumps on the scrotal skin.
There may be a history of one or more of them becoming red, inflamed
and tender with discharge.

Indirect inguinal hernia
The patient will be often aware of what the lump is. He may be able to
reduce it. The hernia may present with a painful, irreducible swelling
and signs of intestinal obstruction.

Hydrocele

[START_SECTION]An idiopathic hydrocele usually presents as a painless scrotal swelling
which may become quite large. They usually occur over the age of 50
years. Occasionally, there may be pain and discomfort if there is
underlying testicular disease. A younger patient presenting with a
hydrocele should raise the suspicion of an underlying malignancy.

Epididymal cyst
This presents as a painless scrotal swelling. Epididymal cysts may
slowly enlarge over many years. They may be bilateral.

Epididymo-orchitis
The patient complains of pain and swelling, usually unilaterally. There
are usually constitutional symptoms of malaise and fever. It may be
accompanied by urinary tract infection with dysuria and frequency.

Testicular torsion
This usually occurs around puberty. It is rare over 25 years of age. There
is sudden onset of pain in the scrotum and groin, which may radiate into
the lower abdomen. This may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
There may be a history of violent exercise, e.g. straining in the
gymnasium, lifting or even masturbation. Always ascertain the exact
time of onset of symptoms. To be sure of testicular salvage, surgery
should be carried out within 6–8 hours of onset of symptoms.

Testicular tumour
Teratomas occur between 18 and 30 years, seminomas between 30 and
45 years. The common presentation is a feeling of heaviness in the
scrotum accompanied by a painless swelling. Occasionally, symptoms
are due to secondary deposits, e.g. abdominal pain from enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Occasionally, distant lymphadenopathy,
e.g. cervical, may be a presenting symptom.

[START_SECTION]Varicocele
The patient (or partner) may notice varicose veins in the scrotum. Often
the only symptom is a dragging ache in the scrotum and groin.
Subfertility may be a presentation and is associated with bilateral
varicoceles. A varicocele is more common on the left.

Haematocele
There will be a clear history of trauma.

Sperm granuloma
This may develop 2–4 months after vasectomy. The patient will
complain of a small tender nodule at the site of vasectomy.

TB
This is now rare in the UK. A scrotal lump with associated dull, aching
pain is the usual presentation. There may be a history of pulmonary or
renal TB. There may be malaise, weight loss, haemoptysis or
haematuria.

Gumma
This is extremely rare. There is a painless swelling of the testis. It needs
to be distinguished from a testicular tumour. Other signs of syphilis may
be present.

Examination
Sebaceous cyst
A small swelling or multiple small swellings occur in the scrotal skin.
They are tense and spherical. Because of the thinness of the scrotal skin

[START_SECTION]stretched over the swelling, the cheesy yellow material contained within
them can be seen. There may be a small punctum surmounting the cyst.

Indirect inguinal hernia
Hernias that descend in the scrotum are invariably indirect. They may
be reducible. It is impossible to get above the swelling. There is an
expansile cough impulse and bowel sounds may be heard over the
hernia.

Hydrocele
A hydrocele is usually unilateral. It may become very large. A hydrocele
is fluctuant, transilluminates and is dull to percussion. If large enough
there may be a fluid thrill. The testis cannot be palpated separately from
the hydrocele. It is possible to get above the swelling except with
infantile hydroceles, when the fluid extends up to the deep inguinal ring.

Epididymal cyst
An epididymal cyst usually occurs above and behind the testis. The
testis can be palpated separately from it. An epididymal cyst frequently
feels lobulated because often the fluid is in locules. They are fluctuant.
Those containing clear fluid transilluminate. Those containing a milky
opalescent fluid are called spermatoceles and do not transilluminate.

Epididymo-orchitis
The scrotal skin is hot, red and oedematous. The tenderness is initially
confined to the epididymis but eventually spreads to involve the testis.

Testicular torsion
The scrotal skin is usually hot, red and oedematous. The testis is
extremely tender and is often drawn up towards the groin.

[START_SECTION]Testicular tumour
There is a firm, irregular swelling in the scrotum. Often the patient
notices the lump when it is very small but in other cases it may become
very large before the patient presents. Rarely the tumour has been
allowed to advance so far that it is attached to the scrotal skin. Check for
palpable para-aortic nodes. Examine the cervical nodes, especially in the
left supraclavicular fossa. Testicular tumours metastasise to the paraaortic nodes, to the mediastinal nodes, and occasionally into the cervical
nodes. Inguinal nodes are not involved unless the tumour has invaded
the scrotal skin, which is rare.

Varicocele
This can only be palpated with the patient standing up. The dilated veins
then become visible and palpable. They are said to feel like ‘a bag of
worms’ but actually feel more like lukewarm spaghetti. The left side is
more commonly affected.

Haematocele
There is a tense, tender, fluctuant swelling. There may be obvious
scrotal bruising. The testis cannot be felt separately as the blood
surrounds it within the layers of the tunica vaginalis.

Sperm granuloma
There is a small, tender, painful nodule at the site of previous vasectomy.

Tuberculosis
The swelling is usually confined to the epididymis, where there is a hard
lump. The spermatic cord and vas are thickened. Occasionally a sinus
may have formed. Check the chest for signs of pulmonary TB. Check the
neck for scars (lymph node drainage for cold abscess) or

[START_SECTION]lymphadenopathy.

Gumma
A gumma is a painless swelling of the whole testis. Other signs of
syphilis may be present.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ chronic disease, e.g. TB. WCC ↑ inflammation, e.g. epididymoorchitis, torsion. ESR ↑ TB, syphilis, tumour.
■ CXR
TB. Secondary deposits from testicular tumour.
■ MSU
UTI associated with epididymo-orchitis.
■ US
Solid versus cystic. Hydrocele versus epididymal cyst. Always arrange
an ultrasound of the underlying testis in the young patient with a lax
hydrocele as there may be an underlying tumour.

Specific Investigations

TB.
■ VDRL
Gumma.
■ US abdomen
Carcinoma of left kidney invading the left renal vein, associated with left
varicocele.
■ Laser Doppler*

[START_SECTION]■ Technetium scan*
Torsion versus epididymo-orchitis.
■ Surgery
Distinction between torsion and epididymo-orchitis.
■ MRI
Abdominal and chest MRI scan may confirm lymphadenopathy
associated with secondary deposits from testicular tumours.
• It is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between
torsion and epididymo-orchitis. Urgent surgical exploration is
required.
• A hydrocele in a fit young male should raise the suspicion
of an underlying malignancy. Arrange a US scan.
• A feeling of heaviness, discomfort, or a dragging sensation
in the scrotum may be presenting symptoms of testicular
cancer. Examine the testes carefully. If any doubt, arrange a
US scan.
• Always examine the scrotum with the patient lying and
standing. Allow at least 10 seconds for a varicocele to appear.

*There is rarely time or equipment to carry out these investigations. If there is any doubt about
the diagnosis, assume that it is torsion and explore the scrotum surgically.

[START_SECTION]Shock
Shock is an abnormality of the circulation that results in inadequate
organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation.

Causes
Hypovolaemic
• Haemorrhage
• Burns
• Gastrointestinal losses

Cardiogenic
• Myocardial infarction
• Acute valvular damage
• Arrhythmia

Distributive
• Sepsis
• Anaphylaxis
• Neurogenic shock (spinal injury)

Obstructive
• Massive pulmonary embolism
• Tension pneumothorax
• Cardiac tamponade

[START_SECTION]History
Trauma
Trauma is a pertinent feature in the history, as haemorrhage invariably
accompanies penetrating trauma. The site and approximate amount of
blood loss should be assessed. Blunt trauma to the chest is associated
with tension pneumothorax, myocardial contusion and cardiac
tamponade. Trauma to the pelvis and long bones can result in closed
fractures, causing significant haemorrhage that may not always be
apparent to the observer. Thermal injury can occur with patients
involved in fires, water-heater explosions and gas explosions. Acute
onset of paralysis following trauma may be due to spinal or peripheral
nerve injury. Disruption to the descending sympathetic pathways with
spinal injuries, results in loss of vasomotor tone and consequently
hypotension.

Dyspnoea
Although tachypnoea is a physiological accompaniment to blood loss,
when dyspnoea is the predominant symptom you should consider
pulmonary oedema from the causes of cardiogenic shock. In addition,
dyspnoea is also a prominent feature of all the causes of obstructive
shock.

Chest pain
The consequences of blunt trauma to the chest have been described
above. In the absence of trauma, the presence of chest pain should lead
you to consider myocardial infarction (central crushing) and pulmonary
embolism (pleuritic).

Precipitating factors
Occasionally patients may be aware of allergens that provoke

[START_SECTION]anaphylaxis. In the community, food products (shellfish, eggs, peanuts)
and insect venom (bees, wasps) are common causes. In hospital,
penicillin, anaesthetic agents and intravenous contrast media are the
major provoking factors. Detailed systemic enquiry for presence of
infection may elucidate the offending focus for patients in septic shock.
A history of profuse vomiting, diarrhoea or intestinal obstruction
(vomiting, constipation, colicky abdominal pain and distension) would
indicate gastrointestinal losses as the cause for hypovolaemia.

Examination
Inspection
A thorough systematic inspection should be undertaken; burns and sites
of bleeding from penetrating trauma may be obvious. Cyanosis is a
feature of large pulmonary emboli and tension pneumothoraces.
Patients with anaphylaxis often exhibit angio-oedema and urticaria.

Temperature
Patients in shock are generally cold and clammy. With septic shock,
however, the skin is warm to the touch and the patient is usually
pyrexial.

Pulse
A tachycardia is the earliest measurable indicator of shock; however, it
may not be elevated in cases of neurogenic shock. The character of the
pulse is usually weak. The rhythm may suggest an arrhythmia as the
precipitating factor in cardiogenic shock. Pulsus paradoxus (decrease in
amplitude of the pulse on inspiration) is consistent with cardiac
tamponade.

JVP

[START_SECTION]A low JVP is a useful discriminator for hypovolaemic shock, as it will
usually be elevated with all causes of cardiogenic and obstructive shock.

Auscultation
Bronchospasm, and consequently wheezing, may be prominent in
anaphylactic shock. Unilateral absent breath sounds indicate a
pneumothorax, while muffled heart sounds are features of cardiac
tamponade. The presence of a new murmur can be due to acute valvular
insufficiency as a cause for cardiogenic shock.

General Investigations
■ Pulse oximetry
Although low saturation per se is not very discriminatory, severe
impairment of oxygen saturation is associated with pulmonary embolus
and pneumothorax. This may be confirmed with ABGs.
■ FBC
With blood loss, a low Hb may be noted, although this will not be
evident immediately. A raised WCC occurs with infection.
Unfortunately, it will also be raised in most causes of acute
physiological stress.
■ U&Es
With significant gastrointestinal losses, low serum sodium and
potassium accompanied by raised urea and creatinine are the usual
abnormalities.
■ ECG
The ECG may reveal myocardial infarction or the presence of an
arrhythmia as the precipitating aetiology. Electrical alternans
(alternating large and small QRS complexes) is a specific indicator of
pericardial tamponade. Widespread low-amplitude complexes are
common in significant pericardial effusion.
■ CXR
May reveal a pneumothorax with deviation of the trachea (although the

[START_SECTION]diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax should be clinical and relieved
before a chest X-ray is performed). The cardiac silhouette may be
globular in the presence of a pericardial effusion; however, tamponade
is still possible with a normal-appearing chest film.

Specific Investigations
■ Blood cultures
Blood and site-specific cultures are essential in suspected septic shock.
The underlying organism may be isolated.
■ Echocardiography
An echocardiogram will be able to demonstrate valvular dysfunction,
the presence of tamponade and massive pulmonary embolism (when
right heart failure is present).
■ CT pulmonary angiography
For the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the presence of shock.
Emergency therapeutic measures (such as thrombolysis) may require a
formal contrast pulmonary angiogram.
■ CT/MRI spine
May be required to assess the extent and confirm the level of injury.
• When assessing patients in shock, it is important to
appreciate that low blood pressure is a relatively late feature.
• In patients with massive haemorrhage, low blood count is
also a late feature and cannot be relied upon to assess the
initial degree of blood loss.

[START_SECTION]Splenomegaly
The spleen must be enlarged to about three times its normal size before
it becomes clinically palpable. The lower margin may feel notched on
palpation. The spleen may become so massive in size that it is palpable
in the right iliac fossa. Massive splenomegaly in the UK is likely to be
due to chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis or lymphoma.
Splenomegaly may lead to hypersplenism, i.e. pancytopenia as cells
become trapped and destroyed in an overactive spleen.

NON-PARASITIC CYSTS

History
Infective
Most infective causes present with fever, malaise and anorexia. With
typhus, there will be a history of foreign travel. Typhus is conveyed
between hosts by arthropods. The patient complains of severe
constitutional symptoms with headache, vomiting, photophobia and
toxaemia. With typhoid, there will usually be a history of foreign travel
or it will occur in the immigrant population. There will be a history of
malaise, headache, fever, cough, constipation initially and then
diarrhoea. Epistaxis and abdominal pain may occur. TB usually presents
with weight loss, night sweats and a cough. If septicaemia is
responsible, there will usually be an obvious cause, and the patient may
already be hospitalised. With splenic abscess, there may be a history of
endocarditis, lung abscess, drug abuse or it may occur in an
immunocompromised host. Syphilis is rare and there may be a history
of contact. With leptospirosis, there is often a history of contact with

[START_SECTION]rats, particularly when swimming in rivers where there are rats by the
riverside. Fever, jaundice, headache, haemoptysis and haematuria are
presenting symptoms. With malaria, there is usually a history of travel
to an area where it is endemic. The patient usually presents within two
months of travel abroad with malaise, myalgia, sweating, coldness,
followed by rigors, high fever and drenching sweats. Hydatid disease
occurs most frequently in rural sheep-farming regions, e.g. Wales. The
commonest presentation is with a cyst in the lung causing dyspnoea,
haemoptysis or anaphylaxis.

Inflammatory
Rheumatoid arthritis may be apparent. Sarcoidosis may present with
lymphadenopathy, fever and malaise, as well as hepatosplenomegaly.
Lupus may present with protean manifestations with cutaneous,
musculoskeletal, renal, pulmonary and haematological problems.
Amyloid may be primary or secondary. There may be cutaneous,
cerebral, cardiac or endocrine manifestations. With secondary
amyloidosis there may be a history of chronic infection, e.g. TB or
inflammatory disease, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. There may also be a
history of neoplasis. Secondary amyloidosis usually affects the kidney
and liver as well as the spleen.

Neoplastic
There will often be generalised signs of malignancy. Often there will be
general malaise with weight loss, and with lymphoma, there will be a
history of night sweats. There may also be a tendency to spontaneous
bruising. Primary tumours of the spleen and splenic metastases are rare.

Haemolytic disease
Haemolytic disease usually presents with the symptoms of anaemia,
namely tiredness and malaise. Jaundice may be present, although is
often not very deep, merely giving a lemonish tinge to the skin. With

[START_SECTION]excessive breakdown of red blood cells, pigment stones may form in the
gall bladder and the disease may present with acute cholecystitis.

Storage diseases
Apart from variable hepatosplenomegaly, these may present with
neurological problems, skeletal deformities or mental deterioration.

Deficiency diseases
There may be a history of pernicious anaemia. Splenomegaly is usually
mild. With iron-deficiency anaemia, there may be dietary deficiency,
malabsorption or blood loss. Check for a history of blood loss.

Splenic vein hypertension
There may be an obvious history, with cirrhosis and signs of liver
failure. Isolated splenic vein thrombosis is rare.

Non-parasitic cysts
These are rare but may arise from organised haematomas, infarcts or
inflammation. They are usually isolated findings when the patient is
being investigated for other conditions.

Examination
General
The spleen appears from below the tip of the left tenth rib and enlarges
towards the umbilicus. It is firm and smooth and usually has a notch on
its upper edge. It moves with respiration, is dull to percussion and it is
impossible to get above it.

Infective

[START_SECTION]With typhus, there is only moderate splenomegaly. The patient will
often be toxic with a generalised maculopapular rash. With typhoid,
there is moderate splenomegaly, the patient being pyrexial with a tender
abdomen and with rose spots on the trunk. Again with TB, the
splenomegaly is only moderate. There may be chest signs. With
septicaemia, there is usually an obvious cause and again there is only
moderate splenomegaly. With splenic abscess, again there is only
moderate splenomegaly and the spleen may be tender and feel irregular.
With glandular fever, the patient will be pyrexial with
lymphadenopathy, and occasionally there is a rash, especially if the
patient has been given ampicillin. Splenomegaly is moderate. With
syphilis, there may be fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy and a rash on
the trunk, palms and soles. Rarely, there may be hepatitis, meningism
and uveitis. With leptospirosis ictohaemorrhagica, the patient is usually
ill with pyrexia, jaundice and purpuric rash. There may be signs of
meningitis. There also may be tender muscles (myositis). There may be
signs of acute renal failure. With malaria, there is often anaemia,
jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. With hydatid disease, the liver is
usually more affected than the spleen. There may be hepatomegaly in
addition to splenomegaly.

Inflammatory
With inflammatory disease, the spleen is rarely grossly enlarged.
Changes of rheumatoid arthritis may be apparent elsewhere in the body.
With sarcoidosis, there may be lymphadenopathy as well as
hepatosplenomegaly. With lupus, there may be cutaneous
manifestations as well as musculoskeletal, renal and pulmonary
manifestations. With amyloid, in addition to hepatosplenomegaly, there
may be signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, purpura
and a large tongue.

Neoplastic
There may be massive splenomegaly associated with chronic myeloid

[START_SECTION]leukaemia, myelofibrosis and lymphoma. Other signs such as
lymphadenopathy and spontaneous bruising may be present.

Haemolytic disease
The patient may have a mild jaundice together with moderate
splenomegaly. A purpuric rash may be apparent with thrombocytopenic
purpura.

Storage diseases
These are rare. There may be signs of cardiac failure, skeletal deformity
or neurological deficits.

Splenic vein hypertension
Signs of liver failure, e.g. spider naevi, liver palms, caput medusae and
jaundice may be present.

Non-parasitic cysts
The only finding may be splenomegaly.

splenomegaly should begin in the right lower quadrant.

[START_SECTION]Steatorrhoea
Steatorrhoea refers to the passing of excessive amounts of fat in the
faeces. The causes are listed below, according to pathogenesis.

Causes
Lipase Deficiency
• Impaired secretion – chronic pancreatitis
• Inactivation – excess gastric acid

Bile Deficiency
• Underproduction – liver disease
• Obstruction – obstructive jaundice
• Increased degradation – bacterial overgrowth

Mucosal Disease
• Coeliac disease
• Ileal resection
• Crohn’s disease

Impaired Fat Transport
• Abetalipoproteinaemia

Lymphatic Deficiency
• Lymphoma
• Whipple’s disease

Drugs

[START_SECTION]• Orlistat

History
Patients with steatorrhoea often pass bulky, sticky and greasy stool that
floats and is often difficult to flush away. Diarrhoea is the usual
accompanying symptom (p. 100) for most of the causes. Jaundice with
pale stools and dark urine implies obstruction to the flow of bile, which
is essential for the absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. The causes
and diagnostic approach to jaundice are found on p. 256.

Abdominal pain
Vague epigastric abdominal pain experienced by patients with chronic
pancreatitis may radiate to the back and is usually worse with food.
Epigastric pain exacerbated by food may be a symptom of Zollinger–
Ellison syndrome, which results in excessive gastric acid production
(lowering the pH of gastric chyme), inactivating lipase. It usually
presents with symptoms of peptic ulceration refractory to medical
treatment. Abdominal pains associated with Crohn’s disease are often
felt in the right iliac fossa due to regional ileitis.

Associated symptoms
Patients with coeliac disease may also suffer with growth retardation
and nutritional deficiencies causing anaemia and muscle wasting. Other
symptoms may include bone fracture due to demineralisation, cerebellar
ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. Joint pains, pyrexia, skin
pigmentation and peripheral lymphadenopathy are among the varied
symptoms of Whipple’s disease, resulting from infection with the
bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. Steatorrhoea is the primary
manifestation of intestinal lymphoma. It may be accompanied by
abdominal pains and pyrexia and occasionally present with intestinal

[START_SECTION]obstruction. Mouth ulcers, perianal abscesses, right iliac fossa pains and
blood PR are some of the symptoms experienced by patients with
Crohn’s disease. Ataxia and night blindness from retinitis pigmentosa
may result from abetalipoproteinaemia, which is caused by the absence
of apolipoprotein B and therefore results in defective chylomicron
formation.

Past medical history
Previous surgical resection involving the terminal ileum will predispose
an individual to malabsorption of fat due to decreased enterohepatic
circulation of bile salts. Moreover, with decreased length of absorptive
intestine, intestinal transit time decreases and there is a decrease in
concomitant fat absorption. Conditions associated with intestinal stasis,
hypomotility and decreased gastric acid secretion predispose to
intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased degradation of bile salts.

Drug history
Ask about Orlistat medication used in the treatment of obesity (prevents
absorption of fats from the diet).

Examination
Steatorrhoea is often associated with malabsorption and therefore
patients may appear emaciated. Mouth ulcers may be due to Crohn’s or
coeliac disease. Clubbing is associated with Crohn’s, liver cirrhosis,
coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis, which is associated with pancreatic
exocrine insufficiency. Jaundice may be present with bile duct
obstruction and liver disease. Bruising may result from impaired
clotting due to vitamin K deficiency. The classical rash of dermatitis
herpetiformis may be seen with coeliac disease. Erythema nodosum is a
feature of Crohn’s disease and may be accompanied by right iliac fossa
tenderness, perianal abscesses and fistulae. Hepatomegaly may be found
in liver disease, and splenomegaly with intestinal lymphoma.

[START_SECTION]General Investigations
■ Faecal fat estimation
Stool collections over a period of three days are performed with a diet
consisting of≥50 g fat per day. The normal value of faecal fat is<7 g per
day.
■ FBC and blood film
WCC ↑ with active inflammation. Acanthocytes are present on the blood
film with abetalipoproteinaemia.
■ ESR
↑ with acute Crohn’s disease.
■ LFTs
Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase ↑ obstructive jaundice.
Transaminases ↑ liver parenchymal disease. Albumin ↓ malabsorption
syndromes.
■ Blood glucose
↑ with diabetes, a complication of chronic pancreatitis.
■ Serum amylase
Usually normal with chronic pancreatitis, but may be elevated if
associated with recurrent acute attacks of pancreatitis.
■ Antigliadin, antiendomysial and antireticulin antibodies
To detect coeliac disease.
■ AXR
Calcification with chronic pancreatitis.
■ Jejunal biopsy
Subtotal villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia with coeliac disease,
which are reversible on a gluten-free diet. Dilated lymphatics and PASpositive macrophages in Whipple’s disease. Absent villi with
lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria and histological evidence
of malignancy with intestinal lymphoma.

Specific Investigations
■ Tropheryma whipplei serology

[START_SECTION]Positive in Whipple’s disease
■ 14C-labelled bile acid breath tests
Screening test for bacterial overgrowth.
■ Serum gastrin assay
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.
■ Small bowel enema
Strictures, skip lesions, fissures and fistulae with Crohn’s disease.
■ Colonoscopy
Mucosal hyperaemia, friability, ulceration and contact bleeding with
Crohn’s disease.
■ CT abdomen
Abdominal lymphadenopathy with lymphoma.
• Always take a careful history as the patient may actually
complain of diarrhoea. In steatorrhoea, the stool is classically
described as pale, fatty and offensive and difficult to flush
away. Clear distinction between diarrhoea and steatorrhoea is
important.

[START_SECTION]Stridor
Stridor is a high-pitched inspiratory sound produced by upper airway
obstruction.

Causes
Congenital
• Laryngomalacia (congenital flaccid larynx)

Acquired
• Foreign body
• Infection
• Epiglottitis
• Retropharyngeal abscess
• Iatrogenic
• Post-tracheostomy stenosis
• Post-intubation stenosis
• Post-thyroid surgery
• Goitre
• Laryngeal oedema
• Anaphylaxis
• Inhalational injury
• Cricoarytenoid rheumatoid arthritis
• Relapsing polychondritis
• Fractured larynx

Malignancy
• Intraluminal obstruction

[START_SECTION]• Larynx
• Trachea
• Bronchus
• External compression
• Malignant nodes

Bilateral vocal cord palsy
• Brainstem stroke
• Thyroid carcinoma
• Oesophageal carcinoma

History
Onset
Instantaneous onset of stridor usually implies an inhaled foreign body.
This is accompanied by violent bouts of coughing, and a clear history
may be obtained from a witness. Stridor indicates partial obstruction, as
complete occlusion of the upper airway is silent. Stridor that develops
over a period of a few seconds to minutes may be due to laryngeal
oedema from an anaphylactic reaction. This may be accompanied by
urticaria and facial oedema. Enquiries should immediately determine
known allergens and treatment can be initiated without delay. The most
common cause of infantile stridor is laryngomalacia. During
inspiration, there is extreme infolding of the epiglottis and aryepiglottic
folds due to inadequate cartilaginous support. Head flexion aggravates
the stridor, whereas patency of the airway is improved by the prone
position and head extension. The stridor gradually resolves in most
infants within 2–3 months.

Precipitating factors
Iatrogenic causes of stridor may have clear precipitating factors.

[START_SECTION]Tracheal stenosis may complicate a long period of intubation or
tracheostomy. Upper airway obstruction occurring immediately after
thyroid surgery may be due to laryngeal oedema, haematoma and
bilateral recurrent nerve injury. Patients who have been rescued from
fires may suffer inhalation injuries due to the high temperature of
inhaled gases.

Associated symptoms
Respiratory obstruction may occur with massive enlargement of the
tonsils, e.g. in glandular fever, or when complicated by a
retropharyngeal abscess. Patients may notice swelling of the neck in the
presence of a goitre and may be either euthyroid or complain of
symptoms of abnormal thyroid function (p. 176). Symptoms of joint
pains, stiffness and deformities occur with rheumatoid arthritis.
Associated stridor can result from cricoarytenoid involvement. Weight
loss can be an accompanying feature of malignancy. Hoarseness of the
voice is an early symptom of laryngeal carcinoma; stridor occurs as a
late feature. Chronic cough with haemoptysis in a chronic smoker
usually heralds the onset of bronchial carcinoma. The location of the
carcinoma may alter the quality of the wheeze. Partial intraluminal
upper airway obstruction from bronchial carcinoma produces stridor,
whereas partial lower airways obstruction produces the inspiratory
monophonic wheeze. Rapid progressive painless dysphagia occurs with
oesophageal carcinoma.

Examination
Inspection
With acute partial upper airway obstruction, patients will often appear
very distressed. Immediate assessment for generalised urticaria, facial
oedema, hypotension and widespread wheezing will allow the
diagnosis of anaphylaxis to be made and appropriate treatment initiated.
Soot on the face and singed nasal hair from thermal exposure may be

[START_SECTION]present with inhalational injuries. A large goitre will be visible on
inspection. Bilateral symmetrical deforming arthropathy involving the
small joints of the hands (MCP, PIP) is suggestive of rheumatoid disease.
Clubbing may be present in the fingers with bronchial carcinoma.
The cause of stridor may be visible on inspection of the throat. Further
information is obtained on inspection using indirect laryngoscopy. With
bilateral vocal cord palsy, the cords lie in a cadaveric position. A small
glottic aperture is seen and does not widen on attempted inspiration.
Supraglottic and glottic carcinomas may be readily visible.

Palpation and auscultation
The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy may be due to infection or
carcinoma of the larynx, pharynx, bronchus or oesophagus. A goitre
may also be palpable in the neck, skewing the trachea to one side due to
compression effects. The chest is examined for monophonic wheezing,
collapse of a segment, pleural effusion and rib tenderness, which are the
thoracic manifestations of bronchial carcinoma.

General Investigations
General investigations should be tailored to the clinical findings.
■ FBC
WCC ↑ infection.
■ ESR
↑ with infection and malignancy.
■ TFTs
↑, ↓ or normal with goitres.
■ Lateral soft-tissue neck X-ray
Radio-opaque foreign bodies.
■ CXR
Both frontal and lateral views are required to identify radio-opaque
foreign bodies. Bronchial carcinoma may present as a central mass,
peripheral mass, collapse of a segment, consolidation of a lobe or as a

[START_SECTION]pleural effusion. Hilar lymphadenopathy may be apparent, causing
external compression of trachea or bronchus.

Specific Investigations
■ Fibreoptic laryngoscopy
Visualisation of the vocal cords, tumour masses, tracheal stenosis and
allows biopsies to be taken.
■ Bronchoscopy
To screen for lesions in the distal trachea and proximal airways.
■ Upper Gl endoscopy
To determine the presence of carcinoma that may be infiltrating both
recurrent laryngeal nerves when associated symptoms of dysphagia are
present.
■ FNAC of a goitre
To determine the underlying aetiology of a goitre.
■ CT neck and thorax
Define the extent and assist in staging of laryngeal carcinoma, thyroid
carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma and bronchial carcinoma.
• Stridor can be a symptom of impending airways obstruction
and asphyxia. Urgent cricothyroidotomy may be required.
• The toxic child with stridor, severe sore throat, respiratory
distress and difficulty in swallowing has acute epiglottitis
until proved otherwise. Urgent admission and treatment is
required.
• If the onset of stridor is very sudden, consider an inhaled
foreign body.

[START_SECTION]Sweating Abnormalities
Excessive sweating is often brought to the attention of the physician
when it becomes socially unacceptable, the underlying cause ranging
from trivial to serious.

Causes
Excessive Sweating
• Primary hyperhidrosis
• Hypoglycaemia

Infections
• Any systemic infection

Malignancy
• Brain tumours
• Hodgkin’s lymphoma

Endocrine
• Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
• Menopause
• Thyrotoxicosis
• Carcinoid syndrome
• Phaeochromocytoma

Psychiatric
• Substance dependency/withdrawal
• Anxiety states

[START_SECTION]Deficient Sweating
• Heat stroke
• Miliaria
• Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia
• Sympathetic tract lesions

History
Apart from heat stroke, the causes of deficient sweating are rare and
usually arise from congenital disorders of the sweat glands, such as
hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a condition associated with poor
hair and teeth formation. Absent sweating can also be caused by
miliaria, which is caused by plugging or rupture of the sweat ducts.
Excessive sweating is commonly encountered as it is a physiological
accompaniment to pain, nausea, vomiting (p. 494) and shock (p. 421).
The causes in the absence of these symptoms have been listed above.
Excessive sweating may be episodic or constant. Episodic bouts of
sweating may be due to hypogylcaemia, phaeochromocytoma,
carcinoid syndrome or menopause. Patients with hypogylcaemia often
complain of associated tremor, dizziness, anxiety and hunger.
Paroxysmal release of catecholamines by phaeochromocytomas may
produce attacks of sweating, hypertension, palpitations, headaches and
anxiety. It usually comes to medical attention presenting as a result of
hypertension. Carcinoid syndrome is produced by a variety of hormones
secreted by enterochromaffin tumours, originating from the small bowel
in the presence of hepatic metastases. Episodic sweating is associated
with brick-red flushing, diarrhoea, wheezing and occasionally rightsided heart lesions.
Hot flushes and sweating may also be prominent symptoms
experienced by women reaching the menopause; the aetiology has often
been attributed to alterations in the concentrations of female
reproductive hormones.

[START_SECTION]Patients with night sweats may complain of waking up with their
clothes and bed sheets drenched in perspiration. Classically, these
features are reported with TB and Hodgkin’s disease. The accompanying
symptoms of pulmonary TB include weight loss, cough and
haemoptysis. With Hodgkin’s disease, patients may complain of
localised lymphadenopathy, weight loss, pruritus, fever and malaise.
Constant sweating and heat intolerance are features of thyrotoxicosis.
This may result from increased metabolic rate and may be accompanied
by symptoms of increased appetite with weight loss, emotional lability,
diarrhoea and palpitations. Rarely, excessive sweating may result from
tumours encroaching on the hypothalamus.
Enquiries should be undertaken regarding substance dependency, as
withdrawal states can produce severe sweating and hallucinations.

Examination
A psychological examination is required if an anxiety disorder is
suspected. The following are specific features in the examination that
may suggest an underlying cause.

Temperature
The presence of pyrexia (p. 395) would suggest infection as the
underlying cause for sweating. However, it can also occur with
Hodgkin’s disease.

Inspection
Wide, staring eyes with lid lag may result from thyrotoxicosis causing
sweating; in addition, the presence of exophthalmos or ophthalmoplegia
specifically indicates Graves’ disease as the underlying cause. Episodic
brick-red flushing of the face may be experienced with carcinoid
syndrome.

[START_SECTION]Palpation and auscultation
The thyroid is palpated to exclude enlargement of the gland. Regional
lymph nodes are examined for enlargement, which may be due to
infection or malignancy. A tachycardia is present with thyrotoxicosis
and systemic infection. A rapid pulse may also be palpated during
paroxysmal attacks with phaeochromocytoma, and the blood pressure
will be markedly elevated. With primary pulmonary TB, pleural effusion
or segmental collapse may be the only features found on examination.
Detection of a new or changing heart murmur may imply endocarditis.
However, either stenosis or regurgitation of the tricuspid or pulmonary
valve have been reported with carcinoid syndrome. The presence of
splenomegaly on abdominal examination may be due to Hodgkin’s
disease.

General Investigations
■ BM stix
Rapid assessment of blood sugar and may be confirmed by blood
glucose estimation. Glucose may be ↑ with phaeochromocytoma.
■ FBC and blood film
WCC ↑ infection.
■ ESR and CRP
↑ with infection, malignancy and lymphoma.
■ TSH and free T4
TSH ↓ and T4 ↑ with thyrotoxicosis.
■ CXR
TB, bronchial carcinoid, chest infection.

Specific Investigations
■ Mantoux test/ELISpot assay
Diluted Mantoux test if no previous BCG immunisation has been
performed to screen for TB. Serological testing is now available for TB.

[START_SECTION]■ Urinary 5HIAA
↑ with carcinoid tumours.
■ Urinary catecholamines and metanephrines
↑ with phaeochromocytoma.
■ Lymph node excision biopsy
Reed–Sternberg cells with Hodgkin’s disease.
■ MRI head
Hypothalamic tumours.
• Drenching night sweats are serious as the underlying
diagnosis may be lymphoma or chronic infection such as TB.
Urgent investigation is required.

[START_SECTION]Syncope
Syncope is the transient loss of consciousness due to impaired cerebral
blood flow.

Causes
Cardiovascular
• Myocardial infarction
• Pulmonary embolism
• Cardiac outflow obstruction
• Carotid sinus syndrome

Vasovagal Syncope
• Situational syncope
• Micturition syncope
• Cough syncope

Orthostatic Hypotension
• Prolonged bedrest
• Drug-induced
• Hypovolaemic
• Autonomic failure

Arrhythmia
• Supraventricular tachycardia
• Ventricular tachycardia
• Sick sinus syndrome
• Stokes–Adams attack

[START_SECTION]Neurological
• Seizure
• Hysterical syncope

Metabolic
• Hypoxia
• Hypoglycaemia

History
Vasovagal syncope (the common faint) is the most common cause of
syncope. It is associated with peripheral vasodilatation and a vagally
mediated slowing of the heart rate. It may be precipitated by situations
such as fear, emotion, prolonged standing or pain. The patient may
complain of nausea, weakness and blurred vision, and appear pale with
bradycardia on examination. Palpitations (p. 370) preceding collapse
may suggest an arrhythmia. Situational syncope are faints classified
according to the precipitating factors and are often due to an excessive
vagal response to the offending stimuli.
Orthostatic hypotension is a drop in blood pressure on standing. This
causes a transient decrease in cerebral perfusion and therefore loss of
consciousness. Prolonged bedrest can result in the deconditioning of the
baroreceptors in the body, resulting in a postural drop of blood pressure.
A drug history may exclude offending medication such as
antihypertensives and opiates. Hypovolaemia is also a cause of postural
hypotension (see Shock, p. 421); it is associated with a pallor,
tachycardia and a low urine output. Disease states such as diabetes
mellitus and Guillain–Barré syndrome can result in autonomic failure
and inability of the body to maintain an appropriate blood pressure.
Cardiac outflow obstruction, which occurs with aortic stenosis and
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, will result in syncope on
effort as the cardiac output cannot be increased on demand.

[START_SECTION]In carotid sinus syndrome, the receptors of the carotid sinus are more
sensitive than normal, thus minor stimulation, such as turning the head
or pressure from a tight collar, may elicit the carotid sinus reflex and
precipitate syncope.
Seizures are paroxysmal discharges in the cortex, which are sufficient
to produce clinically detectable events, e.g. convulsions, loss of
consciousness or behavioural symptoms. Although it is not strictly
syncope, atonic seizures may present in a similar fashion, with a sudden
loss of muscle tone and collapse. Patients may be incontinent during a
seizure and drowsy or confused during the post-ictal phase.
Hysterical syncope tends to be very dramatic with normal
examination findings during the attack.
Hypoglycaemia causes faintness and even results in loss of
consciousness. It tends to be more common with insulin-treated
diabetics but may also occur in normal individuals after an alcohol
binge. Symptoms usually occur when the glucose is below 2.5 mmol/L.

Examination
Appearance
Vasovagal syncope often results in pallor of the complexion and
clamminess. Convulsions may occur.

Blood pressure
Should be taken supine and standing, only then will a postural drop be
noted.

Pulse
During the attack of syncope, taking the pulse is a good way to detect an
arrhythmia. Bradycardia is the usual finding in vasovagal syncope.
Stokes–Adams attacks result from complete heart block causing a
transient period of asystole, with full recovery. The sick sinus syndrome

[START_SECTION]is associated with alternating episodes of bradycardia and tachycardia.
Shock, supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias may result in very
rapid heart rates.
Pressure on the carotid sinus, located at the bifurcation of the carotid
arteries, will cause syncope in patients with carotid sinus syndrome.

Auscultation
The soft second heart sound and an ejection systolic murmur radiating
to the carotids characterises aortic valvular stenosis. An ejection systolic
murmur can also be auscultated in hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy, where the outflow of blood from the left ventricle is
obstructed owing to hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle.

General Investigations
■ BM stix
Testing the blood for glucose with BM stix is a simple and very rapid
way of obtaining a blood glucose level. More accurate readings can be
confirmed with a serum sample.
■ FBC
Will indicate anaemia when haemorrhage is the underlying cause of
hypovolaemia. Septic shock with peripheral vasodilatation may be
associated with an elevated white cell count.
■ U&Es and serum glucose
Electrolyte abnormalities will predispose to seizures.
■ Blood glucose
Hypoglycaemia.
■ ECG
When obtained during an attack, an ECG may reveal an arrhythmia.
Pulseless ventricular tachycardia should be treated as ventricular
fibrillation and cardiac resuscitation should commence. Q waves and ST
elevations may be seen with myocardial infarction.

[START_SECTION]Specific Investigations
■ EEG
Although epilepsy is essentially a clinical diagnosis, seizures associated
with specific electrical changes in the cortex can be used to confirm the
diagnosis. A negative EEG does not, however, exclude epilepsy.
■ 24-hour ECG
May be able to document arrhythmias associated with episodes of
syncope.
■ Echocardiography
Allows assessment of the aortic valve and diagnosis of hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy.
■ V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiography
Allows diagnosis of the majority of acute pulmonary emboli.
■ Tilt table testing
This is usually reserved for patients with recurrent syncope of
indeterminate cause. In patients with vasovagal syncope, a 60° tilt will
produce hypotension, bradycardia and syncope within 30 minutes.
• Syncope should never be ignored due to the potential
serious consequences of this symptom. Any suggestion of a
cardiac cause requires urgent investigation and treatment.

[START_SECTION]Thirst
True thirst as a symptom, is usually associated with two other
symptoms, i.e. drinking excessive amounts of water (polydipsia) and
excessive urination (polyuria).

Causes
Inadequate Fluid Intake
• General debility
• Neurological disease
• Anorexia

Excessive Fluid Loss
• Vomiting
• Fever
• Diarrhoea
• Blood loss sufficient to decrease blood volume
• Excessive sweating
• Burns

Endocrine and Metabolic
• Diabetes mellitus
• Diabetes insipidus (cranial and nephrogenic)
• Chronic renal failure

Drugs
• Diuretics (especially overdose)
• Ecstasy

[START_SECTION]Causes of Dry Mouth
• Sjögren’s syndrome
• Drugs, e.g. anticholinergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors
• Post head and neck radiotherapy

Psychiatric
• Psychogenic polydipsia

Diet
• Salty foods
• Spicy foods

History
It is important to distinguish between thirst and a dry mouth. Enquire
about the onset of thirst, whether it is acute or chronic. Take a full
dietary history, including salt intake and ingestion of spicy foods. A
history of tiredness and lethargy with weight loss will suggest diabetes
mellitus. Check for signs of infection. Check for a history of vomiting or
diarrhoea. A full drug history should be taken, as some drugs, e.g.
anticholinergics, can result in dryness of the mouth and therefore
patients may ingest excessive quantities of water, giving rise to polyuria.
A history of any salivary gland swelling in association with dry eyes,
dry mouth and arthritis should be sought, which would suggest
Sjögren’s syndrome. A history of any chronic blood loss should be
sought. Malignancy and hyperparathyroidism are a common cause of
chronic hypercalcaemia, which can lead to polyuria by an intrinsic
osmotic effect or by precipitation of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Cranial diabetes insipidus can result from severe, blunt head injuries,
craniopharyngioma, pineal gland tumours or as a transient
postoperative complication following neurosurgery. Full psychological
assessment may be required if psychogenic polydipsia is suspected.

[START_SECTION]Examination
Check the temperature. Look for signs of dehydration, e.g. dry coated
tongue, loss of skin turgor. Look for evidence of recent weight loss. Look
for signs of Sjögren’s syndrome, i.e. symmetrical enlargement of the
salivary glands both parotid and submandibular. Check for dry eyes and
arthritis.

General Investigations
■ Urinalysis
Diabetes. Sugar and ketones in the urine.
■ FBC
PCV ↑ dehydration. Hb ↓ blood loss. WCC ↑ infection.

[START_SECTION]■ Renal biopsy
Renal failure.
• It is important to distinguish between true thirst and a dry
mouth.
• Thirst in an acute illness may be due to dehydration. It may
also herald acute onset of diabetes. Always carry out a
urinalysis to exclude diabetes mellitus.

[START_SECTION]Throat Conditions
A sore throat is an extremely common symptom, especially in children
and young adults. Prolonged sore throat in an elderly patient is a cause
for concern, as it may indicate the presence of neoplasia.

Causes
Infective
• Tonsillitis (Fig. 59)
• Bacterial, e.g. streptococcus, gonococcus
• Viral, e.g. glandular fever
• Pharyngitis
• Viral
• Fungal
• Quinsy

FIGURE 59 Follicular tonsillitis.
Bacterial tonsillitis with exudative pus coating inflamed tonsils.

Inflammatory
• Thyroiditis

[START_SECTION]Neoplastic
• Carcinoma
• Tonsil
• Posterior third of the tongue
• Larynx • (common in Hong Kong, Singapore)
• Lymphoma
• Haematological disorders

Neurological
• Glossopharyngeal neuralgia

Referred Pain
• Angina
• Oesophageal spasm

Other
• Reflux oesophagitis
• AIDS

History
Infective
Sore throat, dysphagia, referred pain to ear, headache, malaise. A history
of oral sex may suggest oropharyngeal gonorrhoea. Quinsy is a
peritonsillar abscess. There is usually a history of acute tonsillitis but
the patient becomes more ill with a high temperature, dysphagia and
referred pain to the ear. In glandular fever, the patient can present with a
severe membranous tonsillitis but usually has malaise and
lymphadenopathy elsewhere.

Inflammatory

[START_SECTION]Subacute thyroiditis presents with a swelling of the thyroid, with neck
pain, fever, weakness and malaise. It is a rare condition.

Neoplastic
Carcinoma of a tonsil presents with painful ulceration with induration.
There is often referred pain to the ear and the patient may spit blood.
Occasionally, the presenting symptom is a lump in the neck
representing metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy. Carcinoma of the
posterior third of the tongue may present with a feeling of soreness in
the throat with difficulty in swallowing. The patient may spit blood and
pain may be referred to the ear. Supraglottic carcinoma may present
with a feeling of a lump in the throat but there is usually a change in
voice and early cervical lymphadenopathy. Lymphoma of the tonsil
rarely causes pain, the patient presenting with enlargement of one tonsil.
Patients with a blood dyscrasia may present with a sore throat resulting
from infection consequent upon neutropenia.

Neurological
Glossopharyngeal neuralgia presents as a sharp stabbing pain at the
root of the tongue, radiating into the throat and ear, triggered by
swallowing or touching the pharynx.

Referred pain
Angina may cause pain in the throat. It is usually associated with
exercise. There may also be pain in the chest, radiating into the jaw and
down the left arm. Occasionally, diffuse oesophageal spasm gives rise to
chest pain radiating into the throat and jaw.

Other
Sore throat may occur with AIDS. It may be due to a variety of infective
organisms, e.g. viral or fungal. Reflux oesophagitis may cause a burning

[START_SECTION]pain in the throat or a sensation of a lump in the throat.

Examination
Infective
With tonsillitis, there is usually pyrexia, foetor and pus exuding from the
tonsillar crypts. The pharyngeal mucosa is often inflamed. Cervical
lymphadenopathy. Check for lymphadenopathy elsewhere, and
splenomegaly, which may be associated with glandular fever. Quinsy is
associated with trismus and the tonsil is pushed downwards and
medially by the quinsy. The uvula is usually oedematous.

Inflammatory
Thyroiditis presents with a tender, diffuse swelling in the thyroid gland,
which moves on swallowing. It is rare.

Neoplastic
Carcinoma of the tonsil presents as a hard, ulcerated swelling on the
tonsil. Cervical lymphadenopathy may be present. In carcinoma of the
posterior third of the tongue and supraglottic larynx, there is usually an
indurated ulcer. Laryngoscopy is required as part of the examination.
Check for cervical nodes and other sites for metastases, e.g. lung, liver.
Lymphoma usually presents as a painless enlargement of the tonsil.
Blood dyscrasias may present with lymphadenopathy and
hepatosplenomegaly. Agranulocytosis results in ulceration and
membrane formation on the tonsils and oral mucosa.

Neurological
The diagnosis of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is usually made from the
history. Touching the palate may trigger the symptoms.

[START_SECTION]Referred pain
Angina and oesophageal spasms are usually diagnosed from the history.

Others
Pharyngitis and tonsillitis may occur as part of AIDS, due to either viral
or fungal infections. Other signs of AIDS, e.g. malaise, fever, weight loss,
chest infections, Kaposi’s sarcoma. Diagnosis of reflux oesophagitis is
usually made on a history. There is little to find on examination.

more serious disorder, e.g. diabetes, agranulocytosis or
malignancy.
• Prolonged and persistent sore throat in an elderly patient is
a cause for concern as it may be an indication of malignancy.

[START_SECTION]Tiredness
Persistent tiredness or physical fatigue with no obvious cause is a
common complaint. It is normal to feel tired at times, e.g. after working
long hours, unaccustomed exertion or sleepless nights. It is important to
differentiate between tiredness due to excessive normal activities and
tiredness due to disease.

[START_SECTION]History
The history is most important in the diagnosis. It is necessary to define
exactly what is meant by tiredness or fatigue. Fatigue is sometimes
known as ‘tired all the time syndrome’. Take a full history to decide
whether tiredness is of a physical, psychological or social nature. Note
the duration of the problem. Is it getting worse? Was there any
precipitating factor? Ask about previous levels of energy and how this
compares with the present. Has the patient noticed any other changes,
e.g. in appetite, increased urine output or thirst or sleep disturbances?
Has there been any recent change in medication, e.g. beta blockers
causing lethargy? Chronic fatigue syndrome is more common in
teenagers and young adults, especially students. It is uncommon after
early middle age. Depression is more common in women aged 30 and
over. In middle-aged and elderly people the symptoms of chronic fatigue
are more likely to represent underlying organic disease.
A history of previous illnesses such as infectious mononucleosis or
influenza should be sought. Ask about bereavement. Weight loss may
suggest malignancy or depression with episodes of fever, suggesting
chronic infection, e.g. TB. Cold intolerance suggests myxoedema. Heat
intolerance suggests thyrotoxicosis. In chronic fatigue syndrome, the
illness may fluctuate from week to week and may occasionally be
relieved by rest. In malignancy, the symptoms are progressive and
deterioration occurs. The same is true for endocrine disorders. Tiredness
associated with depression may fluctuate considerably with changing
circumstances. Ask about the patient’s lifestyle. Is there an excessive
consumption of alcohol? Alcohol itself may cause tiredness but if
alcohol is being used as a coping mechanism for stress-related illness, it
is likely to aggravate rather than alleviate the problem. Ask about
recreational drugs. Ask about work. Have the patient’s work
circumstances changed and are they working very long hours together
with home commitments. Take a full neurological history to exclude
conditions such as multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis. Ask about
excessively hard training in runners, weight trainers and athletes. The
over-training syndrome may lead to persistent fatigue. Carbon

[START_SECTION]monoxide poisoning is rare but does occur occasionally and it is
appropriate to take a history about any change of health of other
members of the household as carbon monoxide poisoning would be
likely to affect them also.

Examination
Meticulous examination is essential. Look at the patient. Is the patient
someone who looks systemically unwell or has lost weight? Is there any
evidence of anxiety, tiredness or sleep deprivation? Pyrexia may indicate
the presence of systemic illness, e.g. TB, HIV. In chronic fatigue
syndrome and in depression, there will be no abnormal physical signs.
A slight tachycardia may occur with anxiety and stress. Check for
clinical signs of anaemia. Check for signs of hyperthyroidism or
hypothyroidism. Anaemia and thyrotoxicosis will produce a bounding,
hyperdynamic pulse. In malignancy, there may be enlarged lymph
nodes or the liver may be palpable. A detailed neurological examination
is required to exclude neurological disease as a cause of symptoms.
Postural hypotension may occur in Addison’s disease.

• Only 20–30% of cases will have a discernable physical
cause. Up to 50% of cases have a mainly psychological cause,
with tiredness as a main feature of depression.
• Tiredness as a presenting symptom in the absence of other
symptoms, e.g. weight loss or weight gain, is unlikely to have
a physical cause.
• Tiredness and weight loss should be taken seriously and
thoroughly investigated – malignancy and hyperthyroidism
are possible diagnoses.

[START_SECTION]Toe Lesions
Lesions of the toes are extremely common. They are caused by a variety
of conditions ranging from simple ingrowing toenails to severe pain
caused by ischaemia. Deformities of the toes are also exceptionally
common, particularly in the elderly.

Causes
Toenails
• Ingrowing toenail (Fig. 60)
• Subungual haematoma
• Subungual melanoma
• Subungual exostosis
• Onychogryphosis

FIGURE 60 Ingrowing toenails of both great toes.
Both medial and lateral aspects are affected in the right great toe but only
the lateral aspect of the left great toe. The patient had suffered repeated
infections. There is overgrowth of granulation tissue and a purulent

[START_SECTION]discharge. Bilateral Zadik’s operation (avulsion of the toenail and ablation
of the germinal matrix) cured the condition.

History
Nails
Ingrowing toenail usually presents with pain at the sides of the nail and
often with infection and local inflammation. With infection, the toe is
painful and throbs, especially in bed at night. With subungual
haematoma, there is a history of injury to the nail. Bleeding occurs
beneath the nail, which is extremely painful, and occasionally the
patient may faint with the pain. Subungual melanoma presents with
pigmentation under the nail. With subungual exostosis, there is lifting of
the nail with deformity. Onychogryphosis is a ‘ram’s horn’ deformity of
the nail. The nail thickens and curves over the end. It is common in the
elderly but may occur in young people after injury to the nailbed.

Deformities
A patient with hallux valgus normally presents with a ‘bunion’. The first
metatarsal deviates medially. It is more common in females. The patient
may complain that the great toe overrides the second toe. Unsuitable,
tight footwear may be a precipitating cause. Hallux rigidus is
osteoarthritis of the first MTP joint. It occurs in young adults. The
patient complains of pain on walking, especially when ‘pushing off’, and
stiffness in the joint. Hammer toe usually affects the second toe. There is
a fixed flexion deformity of the PIP joint and compensatory
hyperextension of adjacent joints. The patient merely complains of a
deformed toe, and may also complain of painful callosities that have
developed where the deformed toe presses against the footwear. With
clawed toes both IP joints are flexed. The tips of the toes may develop

[START_SECTION]painful callosities.

Ulcers
Ulcers are usually ischaemic (painful) or neuropathic (painless). Check
for a history of intermittent claudication, smoking, Raynaud’s disease,
cardiac disease, diabetes. With neuropathic ulcers, there may be a
history of diabetes, nerve injuries, spinal cord lesions. Ulcers usually
occur on the pressure points over the tips of the toes. Neoplastic ulcers
on the toes are extremely rare. Melanoma may occur on the toes but is
usually subungual.

Discoloration
Painful discoloration, either red or shiny, white, blue or black
(gangrene), suggests ischaemia. Chilblains occur in childhood and early
adult life, usually in females. They are more likely in those with outdoor
occupations. Painful swelling occurs on the toes, which may become
itchy. They are often multiple and may develop into shallow ulcers.

Examination
Nails
With ingrowing toenails, there is often a serous discharge or purulent
discharge from the nailfold. The toe becomes red and swollen.
Granulation tissue may be apparent at the nailfold. Subungual
haematoma is usually obvious. Occasionally however, the patient
forgets the injury and presents with a brownish discoloration under the
nail and this has to be distinguished from a melanoma. Haematoma is
usually reddish-brown with sharp edges, the melanoma being
brownish-grey with an indistinct edge. A haematoma grows out with
the nail. A melanoma does not. With suspected melanoma, examine the
regional lymph nodes and liver for secondaries. Subungual exostosis
results in deformity of the nail, which is pushed up and deformed. The

[START_SECTION]swelling between the toe and the end of the nail eventually becomes
obvious. Onychogryphosis is obvious with a thick discoloured nail,
which curves over at the end (ram’s horn deformity).

Deformities
With hallux valgus, the first metatarsal bone deviates medially, the great
toe laterally. There may be a thickened bursa over the medial aspect of
the joint (bunion). The great toe may override the second toe. In hallux
rigidus, there is a stiff, painful, enlarged, first MTP joint. With hammer
toe, the second toe is usually affected. There is a fixed flexed deformity
of the PIP joint and compensatory hyperextension of the adjacent joint.
Check for the presence of corns and callosities. In claw toes both IP
joints are flexed (see Foot deformities, p. 160).

Ulcers
Punched out, painful ulcers over pressure points suggest ischaemic
ulcers. Check for discoloration of the toe, capillary return and absence of
foot pulses. Neuropathic ulcers are painless; the circulation is usually
good, but sensation is absent or blunted locally. Carry out a full
neurological examination.

Discoloration
With ischaemic toe, it may be shiny red, blue, white or black with
gangrene. Examine the pulses. Chilblains are usually reddish-blue, the
skin being oedematous and blistering may occur, which bursts, leaving
superficial ulcers.

• A pigmented lesion below the nail (subungual) may be a
haematoma or melanoma. Check carefully for a history of
trauma. A haematoma grows out with the nail; a melanoma
does not.
• Arteriopaths who develop painful toes need urgent
investigation. It may be due to the development of critical
ischaemia or may be embolic.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Tongue Disorders
Tongue disorders are extremely common, ranging from minor furring of
the tongue to extensive inflammation and malignancy. Tongue disorders
are often a manifestation of systemic disease.

Causes
Furring
• Gastrointestinal disease
• Dehydration
• Mouth breathers
• Smokers
• Antibiotics

Colour Change
• White patches, e.g. leucoplakia, thrush
• Pallor (anaemia)
• Blue (central cyanosis)
• Red
• Pernicious anaemia
• Vitamin B deficiency
• Pigmented
• Addison’s disease

Swelling (Macroglossia)

FIGURE 61 Ulcerating squamous cell carcinoma on the lateral margin of
the tongue.

Wasting

[START_SECTION]• Bulbar palsy
• Hypoglossal nerve palsy

History
Furring
A history of gastrointestinal disease, dehydration, mouth breathing,
smoking or antibiotics.

Colour change
White patches on the tongue are suggestive of leucoplakia or
candidiasis, the last being associated with antibiotic therapy,
chemotherapy or immunosuppression. Hairy leucoplakia is associated
with EBV and is found almost exclusively in patients with HIV. A pale
tongue may indicate anaemia, a blue tongue central cyanosis. The
patient may present with a red, painful tongue, which may occur in
pernicious anaemia or other forms of vitamin B deficiency.
Pigmentation may be a sign of Addison’s disease.

Swelling
The patient may present with a swollen tongue, which may or may not
be painful. Difficulty in articulation or swallowing may be apparent.
Congenital hypothyroidism (formerly known as cretinism) will be
obvious (extremely rare nowadays), as will Down’s syndrome. A
swollen tongue may be a presentation of myxoedema. Other symptoms
of myxoedema may be present, e.g. slowness, weight gain, dry skin,
hoarse voice, constipation, lethargy, dislike of cold weather.
Acromegaly may be obvious, the patient having noticed an increase in
shoe size, change in voice and jaw changes. Infection (see below) may
present with swelling, as may allergies or trauma, especially burns with

[START_SECTION]hot fluids or caustic substances. Infection will result in a painful tongue,
the classical predispositions to chronic superficial glossitis being the six
Ss: syphilis, smoking, spices, spirits, sepsis, sharp teeth.

Chronic superficial glossitis
There is a sequence of chronic inflammatory, degenerative and
hypertrophic changes in the tongue, which terminate in the development
of a carcinoma. There may be a history of the six Ss: syphilis, smoking,
sharp tooth, spirits, spices and sepsis. The patient is usually over the age
of 50 and presents with a tongue that has become shiny or white, or has
developed a lump on the tongue. There is usually no pain and no
interference with eating.

Ulceration
Ulceration is common. Aphthous ulcers are painful and are often
associated with chronic debilitating disease. Dental trauma from a sharp
tooth or ill-fitting dentures may cause ulcers. Chancre and gumma
associated with syphilis are rare. Carcinoma has a peak incidence at 60–
70 years and presents with a painless ulcer on the tongue, often at the
margins on the dorsal surface. Carcinoma of the posterior third of the
tongue may present with referred pain to the ear, the pain being referred
from the lingual branch of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies the
tongue, to the ear, via the auriculotemporal nerve.

Wasting
Wasting of the tongue is caused by paralysis of the hypoglossal nerve.
Check for a history of recent trauma or surgery to the neck, which may
have damaged the hypoglossal nerve. Atrophy of the tongue occurs on
the same side as the lesion.

Examination

[START_SECTION]Furring
Examination will reveal uniformed furring of the tongue. Note its
colour. Look for signs of gastrointestinal disease.

Colour change
This will usually be obvious. White patches on the tongue may be due to
leucoplakia. The white plaques may fissure with time. This is a premalignant condition. Other white patches may be due to candidal
infection (thrush). Unlike leucoplakia, these white plaques may be
rubbed off, revealing ulcerated buccal mucosa underneath. Colour
changes may be uniform (pallor and cyanosis) or patchy (the
pigmentation of Addison’s disease). In pernicious anaemia the tongue is
red, bald and painful.

Swelling
The tongue is large and tends to protrude in Down’s syndrome. Other
signs of Down’s syndrome will be apparent, e.g. epicanthic folds, mental
retardation. Look for signs of congenital hypothyroidism, e.g. stunted
growth, relatively large head, thick eyelids, thick broad nose, thick lips,
widely spaced eyes. With myxoedema, there will be dry skin, dry hair,
goitre, slow relaxing reflexes, congestive cardiac failure and non-pitting
oedema. With acromegaly, there will be large feet, prognathism, thick
spade-like hands, deep voice and possibly cardiac failure. In generalised
infections, the tongue will be red and swollen. Allergies may present
with a swollen tongue, lips, larynx, bronchospasm and rash. There will
usually be a history of exposure to an allergen. The ingestion of
corrosive or hot fluids will result in inflammation not only to the tongue
but also to the rest of the mouth and the pharynx.

Chronic superficial glossitis
Examination reveals a thin, grey transparent film on the tongue in the

[START_SECTION]early stages. Leucoplakia occurs next and eventually overt carcinoma
develops.

Ulceration
Aphthous ulcers start as tender vesicular lesions with a hyperaemic
base, which ulcerate leaving a small, white, circular, deep, painful ulcer.
Dental trauma will usually result in ulcers at the lateral margins of the
tongue adjacent to a sharp tooth. Chancres and gummas are rare, as is
tuberculous ulcer of the tongue. A carcinomatous ulcer usually occurs
on the upper surface of the tongue, most often at the lateral margins. It
feels hard, has an everted edge, is friable and bleeds. Local lymph nodes
may be palpable, due to either secondary infection or metastases.

Wasting
Ask the patient to protrude the tongue. Wasting will be noted on the
affected side and the tongue deviates to the side of the lesion. Check for
scars on the neck to suggest hypoglossal nerve damage.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR, CRP
Hb ↓ anaemia (microcytic, macrocytic). WCC ↑ infection. ESR and CRP ↑

• A mouth ulcer which does not settle requires further
investigation for malignancy, especially in smokers.
• Candidal infection may be the first manifestation of diabetes
or an immunosuppressive disease, e.g. HIV infection.

[START_SECTION]Tremor
A tremor is a rhythmic oscillation of a body part and usually refers to
the movements around the small joints of the hands.

Causes
Resting Tremor
• Parkinson’s disease

Action Tremor
• Idiopathic
• Benign essential tremor
• Physiological
• Anxiety
• Exercise
• Chronic respiratory disease
• Thyrotoxicosis

Drugs
■ Caffeine
■ Alcohol (including alcohol withdrawal)
■ Drug withdrawal (benzodiazepines, opiates)
■ Beta agonists
■ Lithium
■ Phenytoin
■ Ciclosporin
■ Anti-psychotic medications

[START_SECTION]Intention Tremor
• Cerebellar disease

History
Tremor is divided into three groups: (1) resting tremor; (2) an action
tremor, which is evident when the hand is held in a sustained position or
against gravity; and (3) an intention tremor, which is present during
movement. Physiological causes of tremor usually have clear
precipitating factors, such as anger and exercise.
An action tremor that resolves when the limb is fully supported
against gravity is characteristic of benign essential tremor; in addition it
may also be relieved by alcohol and is attenuated during movement. Up
to one-third of patients with benign essential tremor have a family
history of it. In addition to tremor, patients with thyrotoxicosis may also
complain of heat intolerance, palpitations, increased appetite with
weight loss, anxiety and diarrhoea.
A detailed drug history will easily allow you to identify any drug that
may potentially cause tremor. Enquiries should also include the amount
of coffee and alcohol intake.
Associated symptoms of slowness, difficulty initiating and stopping
walking, muscle rigidity and muscle fatigue (especially with writing)
may be present with Parkinson’s disease. With cerebellar disease,
difficulties may be experienced with balance and coordination.

Examination
Tremor
Observe the patient at rest: the presence of a pill-rolling tremor is
suggestive of Parkinson’s disease. In addition, there may be
expressionless facies, titubation and drooling of saliva. Thyrotoxic
patients will be thin, with wide, staring eyes, lid lag, a goitre and

[START_SECTION]exophthalmos with Graves’ disease.
The arms are then held outstretched; all other causes of tremor will
now be visible. Fine tremors can be accentuated by placing a piece of
paper on the outstretched hands. The arm should be fully supported and
this will cause resolution of benign essential tremor. An intention
tremor is demonstrated by the finger–nose test; a tremor is markedly
increased when the finger approaches the target. In addition, there may
also be past-pointing, where the finger overshoots the target.

General
Following this evaluation, further examination may be required to
determine the underlying cause. The gait is assessed (p. 172) and
differences between the parkinsonian and ataxic gait of cerebellar
disease will be obvious. Further features of cerebellar dysfunction are
scanning speech, dysdiadochokinesia, nystagmus and pendular reflexes.
When thyrotoxicosis is suspected, the thyroid gland is palpated, ocular
movements assessed and the thyroid gland auscultated for a bruit
associated with Graves’ disease. Features of prolonged alcohol excess
may be present (signs of chronic liver disease) and alcohol may lead to
cerebellar degeneration.

General Investigations
■ TSH and free T4
↓ TSH and ↑ T4 with thyrotoxicosis.
■ LFTs
Abnormalities of synthetic liver function may be present in chronic
alcohol excess.
■ ABGs
Hypoxia and CO2 retention in respiratory disease.

Specific Investigations

[START_SECTION]■ CT/MRI head
For the evaluation of patients with impaired coordination suggestive of
cerebellar disease.
• The tremor of Parkinson’s disease is often subtle and
therefore other features of this condition should be sought.
• Always consider alcohol excess as a possible cause of
tremor.

[START_SECTION]Urethral Discharge
Any inflammatory condition within the urethra may cause a discharge.
It is important to diagnose venereal conditions so that appropriate
treatment is given, not only to the patient but also to sexual contacts.

Causes
• Prostatitis
• Non-gonococcal urethritis
• Bacterial
• Coliforms
• Gonorrhoea
• Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid)
• TB
• Syphilis (chancre)
• Reiter’s disease
• Traumatic
• Instrumental
• Accidental
• Foreign body
• Chemical
• Neoplastic

History
General

[START_SECTION]For any sexually transmitted disease, check for a history of sexual
contact, time of last sexual intercourse, contraceptive methods, number
and duration of relationships, sexual practices and unusual sexual
practices.

Prostatitis
Urethral discharge is rare with acute prostatitis. With chronic
prostatitis, there may be a clear white urethral discharge. The patient
may also complain of suprapubic pain, low back pain, perineal
discomfort and pain referred to the testicles.

Non-gonococcal urethritis
The patient complains of urethral discharge, which may be thinner than
with gonorrhoea. The presentation may be less acute than with
gonorrhoea.

Gonorrhoea
The patient will complain of a thickish, purulent urethral discharge and
dysuria. Prostatitis and epididymitis may occur, the patient complaining
of deep perineal pain or scrotal swelling.

Other bacterial
Urethritis may occur with urinary tract infections. Infection with
Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid or soft sore. It is a tropical
infection causing painful genital ulcers and swelling of the inguinal
glands. The soft sores may affect the terminal urethra, resulting in
dysuria and a profuse, thin, watery discharge. TB of the urethra is very
rare. It is usually secondary to TB elsewhere in the genitourinary tract. A
syphilitic chancre is now rare but presents as a painful swelling
involving the terminal urethra.

[START_SECTION]Reiter’s disease
The patient is usually a young male with recent non-specific urethritis,
or it may follow an attack of dysentery. Apart from a urethral discharge,
there may be a history of conjunctivitis and joint pains.

Trauma
Urethral instrumentation or prolonged catheterisation may cause
urethritis. There will be a clear history of this. Foreign bodies may be
introduced by the patient. The variety of these defies description! Other
foreign bodies include stones passing from the bladder or fragments of
urethral catheters. The patient may also be too embarrassed to confess
that s/he has introduced a foreign body into the urethra.

Chemical
Chemical urethritis is more common in females. There may be a history
of change of soap or bath oils.

Neoplastic
Urethral carcinoma is rare. The patient will complain of dysuria and
bloodstained urethral discharge.

Examination
Prostatitis
There may be a tender, occasionally boggy prostate on digital rectal
examination.

Non-gonococcal urethritis
Pus may again be seen at the external urethral meatus. Check for
prostatitis and epididymitis.

[START_SECTION]Gonorrhoea
Often a bead of pus may be seen at the external urethral meatus. It is
appropriate to check for evidence of proctitis or anal discharge
(homosexuals). There may be evidence of prostatitis, there being a
tender, boggy prostate on digital rectal examination. Palpation of the
scrotum may reveal epididymitis.

Other bacterial
Other forms of urethritis may show a discharge at the external urethral
meatus. With chancroid, there may be sores on the genitals with sores
around the meatus. Check for inguinal lymphadenopathy. Urethral TB is
very rare. Check for evidence of TB elsewhere, e.g. lungs, kidneys,
epididymis. With a syphilitic chancre the meatus is oedematous and
swollen. There may be inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Reiter’s disease
Examine for conjunctivitis and arthritis. There may be co-existent
plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis. Examine for abscesses on the
soles of the feet and palms of the hands (keratoderma blenorrhagica).

Traumatic
Feel along the course of the urethra for tenderness or palpable stone or
foreign body.

Neoplastic
A hard lump may be felt along the course of the urethra. Pressure on it
may cause a bloodstained urethral discharge.

General Investigations

[START_SECTION]■ FBC, ESR
WCC ↑ in infection, e.g. gonorrhoea. ESR ↑ inflammation, e.g. syphilis.
■ Swab
Microscopy and culture and sensitivity of urethral discharge. This may
grow gonococcus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas spp, Ureaplasma
urealyticum. Secondary infection, e.g. with candida or coliforms, may
occur. Haemophilus ducreyi may be grown in chancroid. Dark-ground
microscopy may reveal treponemes in syphilis.

Specific Investigations
■ EMSU
TB.
■ Prostatic massage
C&S of discharge in chronic prostatitis.
■ VDRL
Syphilitic chancre.
■ Cystourethroscopy
Foreign body. Urethral carcinoma.
• Always take a full sexual history, including unusual sexual
practices and, if STD is suspected, refer to a GUM clinic for
full assessment and contact tracing.

[START_SECTION]Urinary Incontinence
Urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine from the bladder.
Loss of urine occurs at times and places which are inconvenient,
inappropriate and socially embarrassing. Stress incontinence is loss of
urine during coughing or straining. Urge incontinence is the inability to
maintain urinary continence in the presence of frequent and persistent
urges to void. Overflow incontinence occurs when the detrusor muscle
becomes flaccid and often insensitive to stretch and the bladder distends.
Weakness of the sphincter mechanism eventually leads to overflow,
when urine leaks out through the urethra.

History
Stress incontinence

[START_SECTION]History of multiple childbirth. Difficult delivery. Recent prostatectomy.
History of loss of urine during coughing and straining.

Urge incontinence
The patient is unable to maintain urinary continence in the presence of
frequent and persistent urges to void. Recent prostatectomy. Recurrent
attacks of cystitis with dysuria and frequency. Past history of pelvic
radiotherapy. History of TB. History of ureteric colic. Persistent
suprapubic discomfort and haematuria associated with stone.
Haematuria associated with tumour.

Overflow incontinence
History of spinal injury involving lumbar vertebra (sacral centre, cauda
equina). History of pelvic surgery, e.g. abdominoperineal resection of
rectum with damage to pelvic nerves. History of diabetes. History of
prostatism with chronic retention with overflow. The patient may still
be able to void reasonably normally but feels the bladder is not
emptying and leakage continues.

Neurological
With upper motor neurone lesions, there may be a history of spinal
trauma affecting the cord above the sacral centre. History of head injury,
CVA, multiple sclerosis or syringomyelia.

Anatomical
Ectopia vesicae will be obvious at birth with an abdominal wall defect
and the ureter opening into exposed bladder mucosa on the lower
abdominal wall. Duplex ureter may be associated with an ectopic
opening of the ureter into the vagina. Vesicovaginal fistula may follow
pelvic surgery or pelvic radiotherapy. It may occasionally be the
presenting symptom of pelvic malignancy. Rarely, ureterovaginal fistula

[START_SECTION]may occur from an erosion of a ureteric calculus into a vaginal fornix.
With duplex ureter, vesicovaginal fistula or ureterovaginal fistula, urine
dribbles from the vagina continuously.

Other
Nocturnal enuresis occurs in up to 5% of 10-year-old children. Bedwetting after puberty usually indicates the presence of an unstable
bladder or other pathology.

Examination
Stress incontinence
Observe leakage when patient coughs. A cystocele or complete prolapse
may be seen.

Urge incontinence
There may be little to find on examination.

Overflow incontinence
There may be a palpable bladder. Carry out a full neurological
examination. Digital rectal examination may reveal prostatic
hypertrophy.

Neurological
Reflex emptying of the bladder occurs. Carry out a full neurological
examination.

Anatomical
Ectopia vesicae – ureters opening into bladder mucosa on the abdominal
wall. With vesicovaginal fistula, examination with a vaginal speculum

[START_SECTION]may indicate the site of the fistula.

General Investigations
■ FBC
WCC ↑ in infection.
■ MSU
C&S for infection.
■ IVU
Assess upper tracts, obstruction, bladder lesions, fistula.

Specific Investigations
■ Cystoscopy
Bladder stone. Neoplasia.
■ Cystography
Vesicovaginal fistula.
■ Urodynamics
Uroflowmetry – measures flow rate. Cystometry – detrusor
contractions. Videocystometry – leakage of urine on straining in stress
incontinence – urethral pressure profiles – sphincter function and outlet
obstruction.
■ CT
Cord lesion. Spinal tumour.
■ MRI
Cord lesion. Disc lesion. Spinal tumour. Syringomyelia.
• Continuous incontinence suggests a fistula, chronic outflow
problems or a neurological cause.
• Incontinence with leg weakness and saddle anaesthesia
suggests a cauda equina lesion. Urgent neurosurgical referral
is required.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Urinary Retention
Retention of urine may be acute, chronic or acute-on-chronic. Patients
with acute retention present as surgical emergencies. Acute retention is
the sudden inability to pass urine, with the presence of painful bladder.
Chronic retention is the presence of an enlarged, painless bladder with
or without difficulty in micturition.

Causes
Local
Urethral lumen or bladder neck
• Stones
• Blood clot
• Tumours
• Urethral valves
• Meatal ulcer

Urethral or bladder wall
• Urethral trauma
• Urethral stricture
• Urethral tumour

Outside the wall
• Prostatic enlargement (Fig. 62)
• Faecal impaction
• Pregnant uterus
• Pelvic tumour

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 62 MRI (sagittal section) of a patient who presented with acute
urinary retention.
The bladder (short arrow) is distended and there is an enlarged benign
prostate (longer arrow).

General
Postoperative
Neurogenic
• Spinal cord injuries
• Spinal cord disease
• Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
• Multiple sclerosis
• Spinal tumour
• Tabes dorsalis

Drugs
• Anticholinergic drugs
• Antidepressants
• Alcohol

[START_SECTION]History
Local
Check for a history of problems with micturition, e.g. difficulty in
starting, poor stream, nocturia, frequency, dysuria. Is there any history
of urinary tract infection, urethritis, ureteric colic (to suggest a stone
which may have passed into the bladder and then impacted into the
bladder neck or urethra) or haematuria? Is there a past history of
prolonged catheterisation to suggest a urethral stricture? A history of
trauma will be apparent. Has the patient fallen astride an object? Has
trauma caused a pelvic fracture? Is the patient constipated, to suggest
faecal impaction? A pregnant uterus will be obvious.

General
Postoperative acute retention is common, especially in elderly men. This
may be due to anxiety, embarrassment, supine posture, pain, drugs, fluid
overload or previous unrecognised prostatism, with minimal symptoms.
After urological procedures, it may be due to blood clot in the bladder.
Check for a history of neurological disease. Has the patient suffered
spinal cord injury? Check the drug history.

Examination
Local
The patient may have a tender, palpable, painful bladder with sudden
onset of retention. In acute retention, the bladder rarely extends far
above the pubic symphysis. In chronic retention, the distended bladder is
often painless and more markedly distended than in acute retention,
often reaching to the umbilicus. With chronic retention, there may be
overflow incontinence. Feel along the course of the urethra for a stone or
stricture. Perform a digital rectal examination to check for prostatic
hypertrophy or pelvic tumour. Following pelvic trauma with urethral
injury, there will be a high ‘floating’ prostate on rectal examination.

[START_SECTION]Check the urethral meatus for ulcer or stone. Examine the patient for
signs of uraemia, which may be present with chronic retention.

General
Postoperative retention will be obvious. Occasionally it is difficult to
palpate the bladder because of pain and guarding related to a surgical
incision. Neurological causes of acute retention or those related to
spinal trauma are often obvious. Carry out a full neurological
examination.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ in chronic renal failure, tumours, haematuria. WCC ↑ infection.
ESR ↑ malignancy and infection.
■ MSU
Microscopy. C&S for UTI. Cytology to confirm malignancy.
■ U&Es
Renal failure. Obstructive uropathy.
■ CXR
Pulmonary oedema (chronic renal failure). Possible tumour metastases.
■ US
Bladder size confirms diagnosis. Dilated upper urinary tract due to back
pressure. Pregnant uterus.

Specific Investigations
■ Urethrography
Urethral valves. Stricture. Urethral trauma.
■ PSA
Carcinoma of the prostate.
■ Cystoscopy
Stone, tumour, stricture.

[START_SECTION]■ Urodynamics
Identification and assessment of neurological or bladder neck problems.
• Digital rectal examination is mandatory in the patient with
retention.
• Faecal impaction in the elderly may be a cause of urinary
retention.
• A history suggestive of disc prolapse with urinary retention
suggests cord compression. An urgent neurosurgical opinion
is required.
• Following catheterisation for chronic retention, do not
empty the bladder rapidly. This may result in brisk
haematuria from the sudden decompression. Controlled
drainage is required.

[START_SECTION]Vaginal Discharge
Vaginal discharge can occur at any age but is usually a symptom of
reproductive years.

Causes
• Candidiasis
• Bacterial vaginosis
• Trichomonas vaginosis (Fig. 63)
• Cervicitis, e.g. gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, herpes
• Excessive normal secretions
• Retained foreign body, e.g. tampon, pessary
• Intrauterine contraceptive device
• Salpingitis
• Infection of Bartholin’s glands
• Neoplasm, e.g. vagina, vulva
• Pyometra
• Colovaginal fistula

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 63 Trichomoniasis.
Typical vulvovaginitis, with perfuse foul-smelling purulent frothy discharge.

History
Obtain a full history of the discharge, including timing, colour,
consistency, smell and the presence or absence of itch. Intensive itch
suggests thrush. An offensive smell occurs with trichomonal and
bacterial vaginosis. Ask whether the patient experiences pain on
intercourse. Pelvic pain, tenderness and fever suggest pelvic
inflammatory disease. Take a full sexual history (young women, change
of partner, multiple partners). Excessive normal secretions just feel wet.
There is no discomfort.

Examination
A red, swollen, sore and itchy vulva suggests candidiasis. The character
of the discharge is important. A thick yellow-brown discharge from the
cervix occurs with gonorrhoea; a thinner yellow-brown cervical
discharge occurs with Chlamydia; a thin greeny-yellow and often frothy
discharge with an unpleasant fishy smell occurs with trichomoniasis; a
thin grey-white fishy smelling discharge suggests bacterial vaginosis; a
thick white odourless discharge occurs with candidiasis. Carry out a PV
and speculum examination. This will show an inflamed cervix with
trichomonal vaginosis and also with cervicitis due to gonococcus,
Chlamydia and herpes.

General Investigations
■ Gram stain
Gram stain on cervical or urethral exudate – Gram-negative intracellular
diplococci in gonorrhoea.

[START_SECTION]■ Vaginal pH testing
pH>4.5 in bacterial vaginosis. pH<4.5 in candidiasis.
■ Triple swabs
High vaginal swab – bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, trichomonal
vaginalis.
Endocervical swab – gonorrhoea.
Endocervical swab – Chlamydia DNA amplification for Chlamydia
trachomatis.
■ Urine analysis (first catch)
DNA amplification for Chlamydia.

Specific Investigations
■ Hysteroscopy
Malignancy/menorrhagia.
■ D&C
Malignancy.
■ Barium enema
Colovaginal fistula.
■ MRI
Colovaginal fistula.
• Malignancy is a likely cause of vaginal discharge in
postmenopausal years. Always perform a full pelvic
examination.
• Always take a full sexual history and, if sexually
transmitted disease is suspected, refer to the GUM clinic for
full assessment and contact tracing.
• Vaginal discharge is rare before puberty. Consider foreign
body or sexual abuse.
• Recurrent thrush may be a presenting symptom of diabetes
mellitus.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Visual Problems
As the sense of sight is critical, patients who present with visual
disturbance are often very distressed. Below is a list of common
conditions that may give rise to visual problems, grouped according to
symptoms.

Causes
Visual Disturbances (Flashing Lights or Floaters)
• Migraine
• Retinal detachment
• Vitreous haemorrhage
• Vitreous detachment

Blurring of Vision
• Refractive errors
• Head injuries
• Acute angle-closure glaucoma
• Blunt trauma to the eye

Loss of Vision
Partial Loss
• Homonymous hemianopia – stroke, tumour
• Peripheral field loss – glaucoma, papilloedema
• Central field loss – macular degeneration
• Bitemporal hemianopia – pituitary tumour
• Horizontal field loss – retinal vascular occlusion

[START_SECTION]Total Loss
Acute
• Amaurosis fugax
• Papilloedema (Fig. 64)
• Raised intracranial pressure
• Malignant hypertension
• Temporal arteritis
• Optic neuritis
• Central retinal vein occlusion
• Central retinal artery occlusion
• Posterior uveitis

FIGURE 64 Papilloedema.
Note the blurring of the optic disc, retinal oedema, flame haemorrhages
(small arrow) and exudates (large arrows).

Gradual
• Cataract
• Glaucoma
• Diabetic retinopathy
• Hypertensive retinopathy
• Age-related macular degeneration
• Retinitis pigmentosa
• Infectious

[START_SECTION]• Trachoma (Chlamydia trachomatis) • (common in
underdeveloped countries)
• Onchocerciasis (nematode infection) • (common in
underdeveloped countries)
• Vitamin A deficiency • (common in underdeveloped countries)

History
First establish if visual loss is monocular or binocular. Ocular or optic
nerve pathology generally causes monocular visual loss, whereas
lesions at the optic chiasma or more posteriorly cause binocular loss
that will respect the vertical meridian. Loss of central vision may be due
to macular or optic nerve pathology. Retinal lesions cause a ‘positive’
scotoma (the patient is aware that part of the field is obstructed),
whereas damage posterior to the retina causes a ‘negative’ scotoma (the
patient does not see that a segment of the visual field is missing).

Visual disturbances
Bilateral flashing lights and zigzag lines are often reported by patients
suffering with attacks of migraine. This is accompanied by throbbing
headache, nausea, vomiting and photophobia. Posterior vitreous
detachment, vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment are all
associated with floaters and flashing lights. Visual acuity and visual
fields are normal at first but may be impaired with a large vitreous
haemorrhage or advanced retinal detachment.

Blurring of vision
Errors of refraction (long- or short-sighted) are the most common cause
of blurring of vision. This is a common problem and is usually corrected
with glasses by optometrists. Head and eye injuries may also give rise to
transient blurring of the vision. With acute angle-closure glaucoma,

[START_SECTION]corneal oedema will give rise to the appearances of haloes around lights
and is associated with a red and painful eye.

Loss of vision
Visual loss may be partial or total. The description of the area of partial
visual field loss is very informative. Complaints of vertical visual field
losses are due to lesions posterior to the optic chiasma and most
commonly caused by strokes, although similar effects can be produced
by space-occupying lesions such as cerebral tumours. Horizontal visual
field losses imply that the cause lies within the retina and is usually due
to retinal vascular occlusions. Patients with glaucoma may complain of
tunnel vision, and patients with macular degeneration may experience
sudden central visual field loss.
Sudden total visual loss is usually due to a vascular aetiology.
Amaurosis fugax is sudden transient monocular blindness due to
atheroembolism of the ophthalmic artery. Patients classically complain
of a ‘curtain descending across the field of vision’. With giant cell
arteritis affecting the ophthalmic artery, sudden onset of blindness can
occur in conjunction with the symptoms of temporal headache, jaw
claudication and scalp tenderness. It is often associated with
polymyalgia rheumatica. Papilloedema may cause transient visual loss,
lasting seconds, related to posture.
Monocular blindness due to optic neuritis may occur with multiple
sclerosis; it is often associated with retro-orbital pain that worsens with
eye movements and starts with a progressive dimming of vision over a
few days.
Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of blindness in
Western society. In addition, diabetics are also more prone to develop
cataracts and glaucoma. In the elderly, gradual onset of visual loss may
be due to cataracts, glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration.
Owing to the gradual onset of symptoms, these groups of patients may
present very late. A cataract may be visible on examination of the eye.

[START_SECTION]Examination
Visual acuity unaided and corrected with a pinhole should be assessed
with a Snellen chart. If visualisation of the largest letter is not possible,
then assess vision by counting fingers. Further tests to use are those of
movement and, finally, the ability to discriminate between light and
dark. With refractive errors, vision can be corrected by viewing the
Snellen chart through a pinhole. Visual fields are examined by
confrontational testing, and the extent of visual field loss can be assessed
approximately.
Pupillary response to light (direct and consensual) allows the
assessment of the visual pathway. Direct light reflex may be lost in
lesions involving the unilateral optic nerve and with central retinal
artery occlusion.
Colour vision will be reduced disproportionately compared with
visual acuity in optic nerve diseases. This may be assessed with the use
of Ishihara plates.

Fundoscopy
A wealth of information is obtained on fundoscopy. The red reflex is lost
with cataracts. Examination of the retina may reveal background
retinopathy with diabetes, consisting of dot and blot haemorrhages with
cotton-wool spots. With hypertensive retinopathy, silver wiring,
arteriovenous nipping, retinal haemorrhages and eventually
papilloedema may be appreciated. Growth of new vessels on the retina
indicates proliferative retinopathy. An infarcted retina appears
oedematous and pale; the macula appears prominent and red (cherry-red
spot). Detached retinal folds may be seen, and clots of blood are visible
with vitreous haemorrhage. The margins of the optic disc become
blurred with papilloedema and optic neuritis but later may appear pale.
A cupped optic disc appearance occurs with chronic glaucoma.
Upon completion of the examination of the eye, a neurological
examination should be performed, followed by a cardiovascular
examination to exclude sources of emboli. The rhythm of the pulse is
assessed for atrial fibrillation and the heart and carotids are auscultated

[START_SECTION]for murmurs. The blood pressure is measured to exclude hypertension.

General Investigations
■ ESR and CRP
Giant cell arteritis.
■ Blood glucose
Glucose ↑ diabetes.
■ Intraocular pressure measurements
↑ with glaucoma.
■ Perimetry
Formal charting of visual fields. Arcuate scotomas are found with
glaucoma. Central scotomas may be seen with optic neuritis. Bitemporal
hemianopias/homonymous hemianopias and quadrantanopias in
neurological pathology.

Specific Investigations
■ CT/MRI head
Tumours, stroke, multiple sclerosis.
■ Carotid Doppler
Atherosclerotic plaque with amaurosis fugax.
■ Temporal artery biopsy
Temporal arteritis.
■ US
To assess retina if no visualisation of fundus behind cataract or vitreous
haemorrhage.
• Sudden onset of visual disturbance or loss is an emergency
and must be investigated immediately.
• If temporal arteritis is suspected, immediate treatment with
corticosteroids is required to avoid catastrophic irreversible
blindness.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Voice Disorders
Voice disorders can be caused by a number of conditions. Change in the
quality of the voice ranges from mild hoarseness to aphonia. It is
extremely important to exclude laryngeal carcinoma, which is easily
treated in the early stages but has a poor prognosis once metastatic
spread has occurred.

Causes
Infective
• Laryngitis

Traumatic
• Blunt trauma
• Excessive vocal use

Neoplastic
• Laryngeal papilloma
• Laryngeal carcinoma (Fig. 65)

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 65 Laryngeal carcinoma.
There is a verrucous squamous cell carcinoma of the left vocal folds. The
entire length of the vocal fold is involved by this exophytic growth.

Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy
• Goitre
• Bronchial carcinoma
• Postoperative – thoracic, parathyroid and thyroid surgery
• Oesophageal carcinoma
• Thoracic aortic aneurysm

Autoimmune Disease
• Myasthenia gravis

Other
• Psychogenic

History
Onset
The temporal profile of deterioration in quality of the voice is useful in
discriminating between the causes. Infection and excessive vocal use
may result in transient deterioration. Progressive deterioration may be

[START_SECTION]due to tumours, and sustained hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal
nerve palsy.

Precipitating factors
Viral infections usually precede and cause acute laryngitis. It is most
commonly due to the influenza virus. Smoking and vocal cord trauma
from excessive use by singers, or simply excessive shouting, are often
enough to precipitate hoarseness. A history of blunt trauma to the larynx
may be evident and hoarseness from resulting laryngeal fractures may
be the first indication of a precarious airway.

Past medical history
Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy associated with a goitre is usually due
to thyroid malignancy. Tumour infiltration of the recurrent nerve may
also result from malignancy occurring in oesophagus and lung.
Hoarseness of the voice may be the first complaint of patients with a
thoracic aneurysm. Previous thyroid or thoracic surgery may have
resulted in vagus or recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries.

Associated symptoms
Sore throat from pharyngitis may accompany acute laryngitis. Pain
referred to the ear or dysphagia can be late presenting features of
laryngeal carcinomas. Rapidly progressive dysphagia is also a symptom
of oesophageal carcinoma. Nasal voice may be accompanied by ptosis,
diplopia and muscle fatigue with myasthenia gravis. Bizarre associated
symptoms with impaired voice intensity but normal coughing ability
should lead to the consideration of a functional cause; however, this
should be a diagnosis of exclusion.

Examination
Indirect laryngoscopy is performed with a mirror and headlamp. If

[START_SECTION]unsuccessful, the larynx can easily be examined with a flexible fibreoptic
laryngoscope under local anaesthetic. A dry erythematous larynx is seen
with acute laryngitis. Vocal cord papillomas and supraglottic
carcinomas may be readily visible. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury will
result in paralysis of the unilateral vocal cord. Upon observing this, a
detailed examination is undertaken to determine the underlying cause.
The neck should be examined for the presence of a goitre. Palpable
supraclavicular lymphadenopathy may arise from oesophageal
carcinoma. The chest is carefully examined for signs of collapse and
effusion, which may be secondary to bronchial carcinoma.

General Investigations
■ FBC
↑ white count with laryngitis.
■ ESR
↑ with laryngitis, carcinoma.
■ CXR
Bronchial carcinoma, widened mediastinum with thoracic aneurysm.

Specific Investigations
■ Tensilon test
Myasthenia gravis.
■ Endoscopy
Oesophageal carcinoma.
■ CT neck
Diagnosis and staging for laryngeal and thyroid carcinoma.
■ CT thorax
Lung tumours, thoracic aneurysms.
■ Arch aortography
Thoracic aneurysm.
■ FNAC
Thyroid carcinoma.

[START_SECTION]• Abnormality of the voice in association with dysphagia,
especially in a smoker, is of grave concern and urgent
assessment for carcinoma is necessary.

[START_SECTION]Vomiting
Vomiting is the forceful ejection of gastric contents through the mouth. It
occurs when the vomiting centre in the medulla oblongata is stimulated.
This may be due to direct stimulation of the centre (central vomiting) or
via afferent fibres (reflex vomiting). Haematemesis (vomiting blood) is
dealt with in a separate chapter on p. 195.

Causes
Central Vomiting
• Drugs, e.g. narcotic analgesics, chemotherapeutic agents
• Acute infections, especially in children
• Endocrine/metabolic
• Pregnancy
• Uraemia
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Hypercalcaemia
• Addison’s disease

Reflex Vomiting
Gastrointestinal disease
Inflammation/irritation
• Appendicitis
• Cholecystitis
• Pancreatitis
• Peptic ulceration/acute gastritis (Fig. 66)
• Peritonitis

[START_SECTION]• Biliary colic
• Ureteric colic
• Gastroenteritis
• Viral
• Bacteria, e.g. Campylobacter, Salmonella spp
• Drugs, e.g. aspirin, NSAIDs, alcohol, iron, antibiotics
• Emetics, e.g. sodium chloride, ipecacuanha
• Poisons, e.g. arsenic

FIGURE 66 Peptic ulcer.
There is a benign gastric ulcer on the lesser curvature of the stomach,
seen at gastroscopy.

Obstruction
• Small bowel obstruction
• Pyloric stenosis
• Large bowel obstruction

CNS causes
• Raised intracranial pressure
• Labyrinthine disorders
• Head injury

[START_SECTION]• Migraine
• Motion sickness
• Ménière’s disease

Psychogenic
• Offensive sights and smells
• Psychiatric disorders, e.g. hysterical, bulimia nervosa,
anorexia nervosa

Others
• Myocardial infarction
• Severe pain, e.g. testicular torsion, fractures
• Irradiation
• Widespread malignant disease
• Severe coughing, e.g. chronic bronchitis

History
General
Nature of the vomiting
Bright-red blood, e.g. bleeding peptic ulcer. Altered blood (coffee
grounds). Bile (high small bowel obstruction), faeculent (low small or
large bowel obstruction). Recently eaten food. Food several days old
(pyloric stenosis), projectile vomiting (infantile pyloric stenosis).

Time of vomit
Soon after meal (gastric ulcer, gastric carcinoma). Early morning
(pregnancy). Chronic chest infection (after bout of coughing).

Relief of pain by vomiting
Peptic ulcer disease.

[START_SECTION]Central vomiting
Take a careful drug history. It will be obvious if the patient is having
chemotherapy. Acute infections in children will usually be obvious.
Check for pregnancy. Endocrine and metabolic disorders will largely be
determined by the result of blood tests.

Reflex vomiting
Gastrointestinal
There will usually be a clear history of a gastrointestinal problem, e.g.
localised tenderness of peritonitis or colicky abdominal pain associated
with obstruction. Take a careful drug history for irritant drugs, e.g.
aspirin. Check for abuse of emetics, e.g. bulimia.

CNS
With raised intracranial pressure, there will usually be headache,
drowsiness and fits in addition to vomiting. With labyrinthitis, there
will be nausea, vomiting, vertigo and often a hearing defect. Ménière’s
disease presents with vertigo, tinnitus and deafness. The tinnitus is
usually constant but more severe before an attack. Tinnitus may precede
other symptoms by many months. Attacks of Ménière’s disease may last
from minutes to hours. Migraine will present with a visual aura with
unilateral throbbing headache and sometimes photophobia. With
motion sickness, the history is usually obvious.

Psychogenic
Bulimia is eating followed by self-induced vomiting. Vomiting may also
occur in anorexia nervosa but failure to eat is usually the prominent
feature. Hysteria may be responsible for vomiting. Full psychiatric
assessment is recommended.

Others
For other causes, the history will usually be obvious. There will usually

[START_SECTION]be severe chest pain in myocardial infarction, and severe pain associated
with testicular torsion or trauma. A history of a fracture will be obvious.
There may be a history of severe chest infection, e.g. bronchitis or
bronchiectasis, associated with coughing bouts followed by vomiting.
There may be a recent history of radiotherapy for malignant disease.
Widespread malignant disease may cause vomiting.

Examination
Gastrointestinal
A full gastrointestinal examination should be carried out. Look for signs
of localised tenderness or signs of intestinal obstruction.

CNS
With raised intracranial pressure, there will be listlessness, irritability,
drowsiness, and the pulse rate will be low with a rising blood pressure.
Check for papilloedema. Ultimately, coma and irregular breathing will
occur. With acute labyrinthitis, there may be nystagmus to the opposite
side from the lesion. The fistula test will be positive (pressure on the
tragus causes vertigo or eye deviation by reducing movement of the
perilymph). Sensorineural deafness may occur in purulent labyrinthitis.
With Ménière’s, there will be rotatory nystagmus and unsteadiness of
stance and gait during an attack, together with past-pointing.

Psychogenic
In anorexia nervosa, a wasted hirsute female will present, often with
anxious parents.

Others
With myocardial infarction, there may be signs of acute congestive
cardiac failure. With causes of severe pain, attention will normally be

[START_SECTION]drawn to the appropriate area, e.g. scrotum with testicular trauma or
torsion. With irradiation, there may be skin signs of recent radiotherapy.
With widespread malignant disease, the patient is often cachectic. A site
of the primary may be obvious. With severe coughing, chest signs may
be obvious.

• Although vomiting is a frequent symptom, with most cases
being self-limiting, it may be a clue to serious pathology.
Further investigation is required urgently if there are any
associated systemic signs, e.g. neurological, abdominal.
• Diabetics need careful monitoring, as vomiting may lead to
poor sugar control.

[START_SECTION]Weight Gain
Weight gain is extremely common and the most frequent cause is simple
obesity. Excessive weight gain itself has deleterious effects on general
health. With the exception of simple obesity and pregnancy, other
conditions account for less than 1% of patients presenting with weight
gain.

Causes
Increased Fat
• Simple obesity
• Hypothyroidism
• Cushing’s syndrome (Fig. 67)
• Polycystic ovarian syndrome
• Hypothalamic disease

[START_SECTION]FIGURE 67 (A,B) Cushing’s syndrome.
Note the central rather than peripheral obesity. This patient also has
typical facial features and a ‘buffalo hump’.

Increased Fluid
• Cardiac failure
• Hepatic failure with ascites
• Renal failure – nephrotic syndrome
• Lymphatic obstruction

Increased Muscle
• Athletes, e.g. weightlifters
• Androgenic steroids
• Growth hormone

Other
• Pregnancy
• Depression
• Drugs, e.g. insulin and gliclazide

History
General
Enquire about the possibility of pregnancy and any changes in dietary
habits that may result in simple weight gain. Rapid weight gain is often
secondary to increased fluid, as opposed to an increase in dry weight. A
drug history is taken to exclude the use of anabolic steroids and growth
hormone, especially in body builders. Enquire about a family history,
diet and amount of activity in relation to simple obesity.

[START_SECTION]Cushing’s syndrome
Patients with Cushing’s syndrome present with moon face, ‘buffalo
hump’ (deposits of fat on the back of neck and shoulders), hair growth,
acne, abdominal striae, muscle weakness, back pain, amenorrhoea, thin
skin, bruising and depression. A drug history should be taken to exclude
exogenous corticosteroids as the cause.

Hypothyroidism
With hypothyroidism, patients may complain of lethargy, anorexia, cold
intolerance, goitre, dry hair, dry skin, constipation and menorrhagia.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome
Women with this condition present with hirsutism, obesity and
menstrual irregularities. It is also associated with insulin resistance.

Hypothalamic disease
Prior history of neurosurgery, craniopharyngioma or other brain
tumours may have resulted in damage to the hypothalamus. As it is the
regulatory centre for appetite, uncontrolled excessive eating may result.

Cardiac failure
Fluid retention from cardiac failure may be accompanied by symptoms
of exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
Ascites and peripheral oedema may also result from congestive heart
failure.

Renal failure
Patients with renal failure may present with lethargy, fragile pigmented

[START_SECTION]skin, peripheral oedema, periorbital oedema, thirst and polyuria.

Ascites
See p. 35.

Examination
Inspection
The distribution of body fat should be noted. Patients with Cushing’s
syndrome have truncal obesity with proximal muscle wasting.
Hirsutism is a feature of both polycystic ovarian syndrome and
Cushing’s syndrome. With hypothyroidism, there may be loss of the
outer third of the eyebrows and a ‘peaches and cream’ complexion.
Inspection of the trunk may reveal thin skin with easy bruising in both
Cushing’s syndrome and renal failure. In addition, striae and thoracic
kyphosis may be present with Cushing’s from wedge fractures caused
by osteoporosis.
Proximal muscle weakness is found in both Cushing’s syndrome and
hypothyroidism. Check for the physique of a ‘body builder’.

Palpation and auscultation
Peripheral oedema may be a feature of fluid overload with renal, hepatic
and cardiac failure. Non-pitting oedema is characteristically found with
hypothyroidism. The JVP should be examined and will be elevated with
congestive cardiac failure and fluid overload with renal or hepatic
failure. The pulse is taken and bradycardia may be noted with
hypothyroidism. The blood pressure is measured and hypertension may
be due to incorrect cuff size or may occur as a complication of Cushing’s
disease. A third heart sound may be present with cardiac failure, and
widespread pulmonary crepitation suggests pulmonary oedema from
cardiac failure or fluid overload in renal or hepatic failure.
Further examination of the abdominal system may reveal the presence

[START_SECTION]of ascites (p. 35), which may result from liver disease, malignancy or
cardiac failure. A complete neurological examination is performed to
screen for neurological deficits, which will warrant diagnostic imaging
to look for lesions involving the hypothalamus. If there is any suspicion
that a patient is taking body-building drugs, e.g. anabolic steroids, check
for testicular atrophy and prostatic hypertrophy.

General Investigations
■ Urine dipstick
+++glucose – diabetes from Cushing’s syndrome or as a complication of
obesity.+++protein is present with nephrotic syndrome. Blood may be
present with renal disease.
■ U&Es
K+ ↓ Cushing’s. Urea and creatinine ↑ renal failure.
■ LFTs
Deranged with liver disease.
■ TFTs
Screen for hypothyroidism.
■ Random cortisol
↑ evening levels may suggest Cushing’s syndrome; a normal result does
not exclude it. Although commonly performed, has little diagnostic
value.

Specific Investigations
■ 24-hour urinary free cortisol
↑ with Cushing’s.
■ 24-hour urine collection for protein
>3.5 g with nephrotic syndrome.
■ Low-dose dexamethasone test
Failure of cortisol suppression with Cushing’s.
■ US abdomen and pelvis
Renal disorders, polycystic ovaries, ascites.

[START_SECTION]■ Echocardiography

■ CT/MRI head
Hypothalamic disease.
■ Renal biopsy
To determine the aetiology of renal parenchymal disease.
• Every opportunity should be taken to modify compliance in
order to reduce weight to an appropriate level. Advice
regarding diet and exercise is a crucial first step.

[START_SECTION]Weight Loss
Unintentional weight loss is often a manifestation of significant
underlying disease and should never be ignored.

Causes
Systemic Disease
• Malignancy
• Cardiac failure
• Chronic respiratory disease
• Renal failure
• Liver failure
• Malabsorption
• Connective tissue disease (e.g. SLE, rheumatoid arthritis)

Endocrine
• Diabetes mellitus
• Hyperthyroidism
• Addison’s disease

Infective
• TB • (very common in the developing world and on the increase
in the developed world)
• HIV • (very common in the developing world)
• Helminth (worms) infection • (very common in endemic
areas)

Psychiatric

[START_SECTION]• Depression
• Anorexia nervosa

Other
• Any terminal illness
• Substance abuse (e.g. laxatives, amphetamines, opiates)
• Drugs, e.g. excessive thyroxine replacement
• Malnutrition (Fig. 68) • (common in developing countries)

FIGURE 68 Malnutrition.
Note the obvious signs of weight loss with widespread muscle and softtissue wasting.

History
General
The timeframe and amount of weight loss should be noted. A dietary
history is required to determine the amount and type of food ingested.
Decreased dietary intake may result from loss of appetite or loss of
interest in eating due to depression. On the other hand, patients with
thyrotoxicosis lose weight, despite a voracious appetite.
Enquiries should be undertaken regarding perception of body image,

[START_SECTION]as patients with anorexia nervosa believe that they are overweight,
despite being severely underweight. Risk factors for HIV should be
screened for and a sexual history as well as information regarding
intravenous drug use should be obtained. Systemic enquiry is required
to identify features suggestive of malignancy or organ failure in each
system to account for unintentional weight loss. A butterfly rash may be
present in cases of SLE.

Cardiorespiratory system
Dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and peripheral
oedema are symptoms suggestive of congestive cardiac failure. With
longstanding cardiac failure, cardiac cachexia results from loss of total
body fat and lean body mass. Currently, the most common aetiology is
end-stage heart failure. Dyspnoea without accompanying orthopnoea or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea suggests respiratory disease. With any
chronic respiratory disorder, basal metabolic rate is increased as a
result of the increased work of breathing. The presence of haemoptysis
may be due to malignancy or TB. A long smoking history is a strong
predisposing factor for the development of bronchial carcinoma and
COPD. Night sweats and weight loss may be accompanying features of
both TB and Hodgkin’s disease.

Gastrointestinal system
Lethargy, diarrhoea, steatorrhoea (p. 431) and abdominal discomfort are
various symptoms suggestive of malabsorption. Jaundice, dark urine,
pale stools, itching, prolonged bleeding, abdominal swelling from
ascites and confusion are symptoms associated with liver disease.
Vague abdominal pains, change in bowel habit, tenesmus, blood or
mucus mixed with the stools may be due to gastrointestinal malignancy.
Patients with helminth infections, such as ascaris, may complain of
perianal itching and notice worms in their faeces. Although this is rare
in the UK, it may be encountered in patients returning from foreign
travel.

[START_SECTION]Renal system
Lethargy, anorexia, nocturia, oliguria, polyuria, haematuria, frothy urine
from proteinuria, skin fragility, pruritus, oedema and bone pains are
some of the multisystemic features suggestive of renal disease.

Haematological system
Localised non-tender lymphadenopathy from Hodgkin’s disease may be
accompanied by pyrexia and pruritus. Persistent generalised
lymphadenopathy, however, is a recognised presenting feature of HIV.

Endocrine system
Polydipsia and polyuria with weight loss may be presenting features of
diabetics. Patients with thyrotoxicosis may complain of tremor, staring
eyes, heat intolerance, palpitations and diarrhoea. With Addison’s
disease, anorexia, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or syncope from
postural hypotension may be experienced.

Connective tissue diseases
Arthritis is a very common presentation of connective tissue disease,
including rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. Patients may also complain of
early morning joint stiffness, lethargy and poor mobility.

Examination
The causes of weight loss are varied. The following specific features
identified on examination may be useful in determining an underlying
cause.

Inspection
Signs suggestive of endocrine disorder may be obvious; a goitre may be

[START_SECTION]visible with thyrotoxicosis, accompanied by exophthalmos and tremor.
Pigmentation of the skin creases and buccal mucosa in a cachectic
patient with postural hypotension are the usual findings with Addison’s
disease. Jaundice, caput medusae, spider naevi and gynaecomastia may
be seen with liver disease. Tachypnoea and pursed-lip breathing may be
evident with COPD. Clubbing may be a feature of bronchial carcinoma,
suppurative lung disease, cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease.
The JVP is elevated with congestive cardiac failure. Swelling and
deformity of the small joints of the hand may be seen with connective
tissue disease. In addition, a rash will frequently be present with SLE.

Palpation and auscultation
Peripheral oedema may be present with cardiac failure, malabsorption,
renal and liver disease. Auscultation of the chest may reveal widespread
crepitations with pulmonary oedema from cardiac failure, or uniformly
decreased breath sounds with COPD. Palpation of the abdomen may
reveal hepatomegaly and ascites with liver disease; ascites may also
occur with cardiac failure and gastrointestinal malignancies. Lying and
standing blood pressure should be measured, as a postural drop is
present with Addison’s disease. Joint tenderness is present with
connective tissue disease.

General Investigations
■ Urine dipstick
Glucose with diabetes. Protein and blood with renal disorders.
■ FBC
Hb ↓ chronic disease, malabsorption, renal and liver failure and
connective tissue disease.

[START_SECTION]Hypercalcaemia
Hypercalcaemia is a serum calcium>2.62 mmol/L (normal range 2.12–
2.62 mmol/L). It may be an asymptomatic laboratory finding. Symptoms
usually become apparent with levels>3.50 mmol/L.

Causes
• Malignancy
■ Solid tumour with lytic bony metastases, e.g. Ca breast,
bronchus
■ Solid tumours with humoral mediation, e.g. inappropriate
PTH secretion with carcinoma of the bronchus,
carcinoma of the kidney
■ Multiple myeloma
• Hyperparathyroidism (primary, secondary, tertiary)
• Sarcoidosis
• Drugs, e.g. thiazide diuretics, lithium
• Excess intake of vitamin A, vitamin D or calcium
• Prolonged immobilisation
• Milk-alkali syndrome (excess calcium intake)
• Hyperthyroidism
• Addison’s disease
• Paget’s disease of bone
• Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia

[START_SECTION]Symptoms and Signs
These depend on the patient’s age, duration and rate of increase of
plasma calcium and the presence of concurrent medical conditions.
Symptoms and signs include nausea and vomiting, fatigue, depression,
confusion, psychosis; abdominal pain, constipation, acute pancreatitis,
peptic ulceration, polyuria/nocturia, haematuria, renal colic, renal
failure, bone pain, hypertension and arrhythmias. Classical symptoms of
hypercalcaemia in association with hyperparathyroidism include
‘stones, bones, abdominal groans and psychiatric overtones’.

• In a patient with depression or psychosis, always check the
serum calcium. Hyperparathyroidism may be a cause.
• In a patient presenting with polyuria, if diabetes has been
excluded, check the serum calcium.

[START_SECTION]Hyperglycaemia
Hyperglycaemia is defined as a plasma glucose>7.0 mmol/L. By far the
most common cause is diabetes mellitus.

Causes
Endocrine
• Diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2)

Drugs
• Corticosteroids
• Beta blockers
• Thiazide diuretics
• Niacin
• Pentamidine
• Protease inhibitors
• L-asparaginase
• Antipsychotic agents

Systemic Disease
• Cushing’s syndrome

Severe Stress
• Stroke
• Myocardial infarction

Psychogenic
• Bulimia nervosa

[START_SECTION]Physiological
• Infection
• Inflammation

Other
• Pregnancy

Symptoms and Signs
The most common symptoms include polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia,
fatigue, weight loss and blurred vision. Acute hyperglycaemia may
present as hyperventilation, stupor or coma as part of a diabetic
ketoacidotic crisis. Recurrent infections are common, especially of the
skin.
The patient may have a history of diabetes or the symptoms may be
the first presentation of the disease. Type 1 diabetes usually occurs in
younger age groups, whereas type 2 generally affects older individuals,
with obesity being a common accompanying condition.
A thorough drug history is important. Steroids are used for a large
number of conditions and therefore the dose and duration of treatment
should be evaluated. The patient may complain of features of Cushing’s
syndrome such as excessive appetite, weight gain and weakness.
Enquire about recent severe illness such as heart attack or stroke.
Hyperglycaemia may develop during the binge phase of bulimia when a
large caloric load is ingested. Ask about episodes of binge eating,
vomiting, significant shifts in weight over time and possible abuse of
emetics. The history of bulimia may be obtained from relatives. Enquire
about current or recent pregnancy.
Examination may reveal complications of diabetes such as vascular
disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and Charcot joints may be present. Skin
infection is common in diabetes, especially boils and abscesses. Obesity
is frequent in type 2 diabetics. Look for the features of Cushing’s

[START_SECTION]syndrome, including central obesity, moon face, hirsutism, cataracts,
weakness, striae and hypertension. Complications of myocardial
infarction may be present such as heart failure. Neurological
examination will reveal upper motor neurone signs following stroke.
Examination findings in bulimia include tooth decay, oral trauma,
dehydration and swollen salivary glands. The latter stages of pregnancy
should be self-evident.

Investigations

• Diabetic ketoacidosis is an emergency which is identified
by clinical features and a significantly raised blood sugar
level with glucose and ketones in the urine. This may be the
first presentation of diabetes or may occur in a known
diabetic.

[START_SECTION]• Causes for diabetic ketoacidosis, e.g. intercurrent infection
or poor glucose control, should be further explored.

[START_SECTION]Hyperkalaemia
Hyperkalaemia is an elevated blood level of potassium>5.0 mmol/L.
Hyperkalaemia is a medical emergency due to the risk of potentially
fatal arrhythmias.

Causes
• Excess administration of potassium, especially rapidly
• Renal failure
• Haemolysis
• Massive blood transfusion
• Crush injuries (rhabdomyolysis)
• Tissue necrosis, e.g. burns, ischaemia
• Metabolic acidosis
• Adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease)
• Drugs interfering with urinary excretion: ACE inhibitors
and angiotensin receptor blockers, potassium-sparing
diuretics (spironolactone and amiloride), NSAIDs (ibuprofen,
naproxen), calcineurin inhibitors for immunosuppression
(ciclosporin and tacrolimus), trimethoprim, pentamidine

Symptoms and Signs
Cardiac arrest. Mild breathlessness (hyperkalaemia associated with
metabolic acidosis). Paraesthesiae, areflexia. Weakness. Palpitations.
Abdominal pain. Hypoglycaemia. Hyperpigmentation associated with

[START_SECTION]Addison’s disease.

Investigations
■ U&Es

levels) – exclude haemolysis. Chronic renal failure.
■ FBC
Exclude haemolysis.
■ Blood gases

■ Plasma cortisol
↓ adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease).
• Hyperkalaemia is a medical emergency. The first sign of
hyperkalaemia may be cardiac arrest due to an arrhythmia.

[START_SECTION]Hypokalaemia
Hypokalaemia is a reduced blood level of potassium<3.5 mmol/L.

Causes
Inadequate Intake
• Potassium-free i.v. fluids
• Reduced oral intake, e.g. coma, dysphagia

Excessive Loss
• Renal
• Diuretics
• Renal tubular disorders
• Gastrointestinal
• Diarrhoea
• Vomiting
• Fistulas

• Steroid therapy
• Hyperaldosteronism

Symptoms and Signs

[START_SECTION]Muscle weakness. Myalgia. Constipation. Paralytic ileus. Cardiac
arrhythmia (ranging from ectopics to serious arrhythmias with sudden
death at very low levels of potassium).

Investigations
■ U&Es
Serum K+<3.5 mmol/L.
■ Blood bases
Metabolic alkalosis – pH↑HCO3− ↑. Blood glucose. Diabetic
ketoacidosis.
■ ECG

Mg↓(magnesium is required for adequate processing of K+).
■ Plasma aldosterone
Raised in Conn’s syndrome.
■ Plasma renin
Low in Conn’s syndrome.
■ Plasma cortisol
Diurnal variation lost in Cushing’s syndrome.
■ Plasma aldosterone
Raised in Conn’s syndrome.
■ Urinary free cortisol
Elevated in Cushing’s syndrome.
■ ACTH levels
High in pituitary-dependent cases, low or undetectable with adrenal
tumour; may be very high with ectopic ACTH secretion.
• In a patient with prolonged ileus postoperatively, always
remember to check serum potassium.
• In a patient presenting with unexplained lethargy, fatigue
and muscle weakness, check the serum potassium. Conn’s
syndrome is a possible diagnosis.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Hypernatraemia
The normal serum sodium level is 135–145 mmol/L. Hypernatraemia
refers to a serum sodium level>145 mmol/L.

Causes
Decreased Water Intake
• Confusion
• Coma

Non-Renal Water Losses
• Gastrointestinal losses (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea)
• Pyrexia
• Burns

Renal Water Losses
• Osmotic diuresis
• Hyperglycaemia
• Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
• Drugs (e.g. lithium)
• Bence Jones proteins
• Post-relief of obstructive uropathy
• Recovering acute tubular necrosis
• Congenital diabetes insipidus

Sodium Excess
• Excessive intravenous sodium therapy
• Chronic congestive cardiac failure

[START_SECTION]• Cirrhosis of the liver
• Steroid therapy
• Cushing’s syndrome
• Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome)

Symptoms and Signs
Thirst usually occurs when the plasma sodium rises by 3–4 mmol/L
above the upper limit of normal. Severe symptoms such as coma,
seizures, muscular tremor and rigidity arise when the level is above
158 mmol/L.

Investigations
■ U&Es
Na+ 150–170 mEq/L usually indicates dehydration.
Na+>170 mEq/L usually indicates diabetes insipidus.
Na+>190 mEq/L usually indicates long-term salt ingestion.
■ Urine osmolality
Central versus nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
■ CT head
Central diabetes insipidus, e.g. cerebral tumour/trauma.
• Rapid correction of hypernatraemia can lead to cerebral
oedema.
• Lack of thirst is associated with central nervous system
disease.

[START_SECTION]Hyponatraemia
The normal serum sodium level is 135–145 mmol/L. Hyponatraemia
refers to serum sodium levels of<135 mmol/L, and serum sodium
of<120 mmol/L is considered severe.

Causes
Hypovolaemic
• Gastrointestinal losses
• Diarrhoea
• Vomiting
• Fistula
• Small bowel obstruction
• Paralytic ileus
• Renal sodium losses
• Diuretics
• Osmotic diuresis (e.g. hyperglycaemia)
• Renal failure
• Other sodium losses
• Burns
• Ascites
• Crush injuries
• Peritonitis

Euvolaemic
• Endocrine
• Severe hypothyroidism

[START_SECTION]• Addison’s disease
• Water load
• Intravenous infusions
• Water drinking (excessive)
• TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) syndrome
• SIADH
• Pulmonary disease (e.g. pneumonia, lung cancer)
• Drugs (e.g. carbamazepine)
• Intracranial disease (e.g. tumour, head injuries)

Oedematous
• Cardiac failure
• Nephrotic syndrome

Symptoms and Signs
Symptoms of hyponatraemia are related to how low the serum sodium
is, and how rapidly it has developed. They can range from
asymptomatic to mild nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise to
diminished reflexes, seizures, stupor or coma.

Investigations
■ U&Es
↓ Na+.↑ urea and creatinine (renal failure). ↑ K+ (Addison’s disease).
■ Paired serum and urine osmolality
SIADH is suggested by inappropriately concentrated urine
(>100 mOsm/kg) with serum hypo-osmolality (<270 mOsm/kg).
■ Paired serum and urinary sodium
SIADH is suggested with inappropriately concentrated urinary sodium
(>20 mmol/L).
• Falsely low sodium values can occur with high circulating

[START_SECTION]levels of lipids, proteins and in severe hyperglycaemia.
• Most patients with hyponatraemia do not require treatment
with intravenous sodium chloride, but, if this is required, the
rate of correction of serum sodium levels must be carried out
with great care to minimise the risk of central pontine
demyelination.

[START_SECTION]Hypoglycaemia
Hypoglycaemia is defined as a plasma glucose<2.5 mmol/L. The actual
glucose level at which symptoms develop varies markedly.

Causes
Drugs
• Insulin
• Sulfonylurea
• Alcohol
• Aminoglutethimide
• Quinolones
• Pentamidine
• Quinine

Endocrine
• Pituitary insufficiency
• Addison’s disease

Neoplastic
• Pancreatic islet cell tumours; insulinoma
• Non-pancreatic tumours; retroperitoneal fibrosarcoma,
haemangiopericytoma

Liver Disease
• Inherited glycogen storage disorders
• Cirrhosis
• Acute liver failure

[START_SECTION]• Alcohol

Other
• Post-prandial dumping syndrome (post-gastrectomy, postvagotomy and drainage)
• Immune-mediated (e.g. anti-insulin receptor antibodies in
Hodgkin’s disease)

Symptoms and Signs
The most common symptoms include sweatiness, palpitations,
weakness, hunger, drowsiness, restlessness, tremor, seizures and coma.
Occasionally personality changes may be a presenting symptom. By far
the most common cause of hypoglycaemia is an excess of insulin or oral
hypoglycaemic agents in a known diabetic. Enquire about a history of
diabetes mellitus and medication. Occasionally relatives of diabetics
may be covertly ingesting hypoglycaemic agents. Insulin has been used
by athletes to improve stamina. Alcohol excess without food may lead to
hypoglycaemia. A full medication history is important.
There may be a history of pituitary dysfunction. Causes of pituitary
failure include tumour, trauma, pituitary surgery and infection. The
symptoms of Addison’s disease include weakness, weight loss,
dizziness and pigmentation of the buccal mucosa and palmar creases.
Islet cell tumours may produce symptoms of hypoglycaemia
intermittently and to varying degrees. Classically, the symptoms
develop during fasting. Personality or neurocognitive changes may
develop. Diagnosis of insulinoma depends on the classical diagnostic
triad, i.e. Whipple’s triad: (1) attacks precipitated by fasting; (2) blood
sugar is low during the attack; (3) symptoms are relieved by
administration of glucose. Check for a history of liver failure. Dumping
syndrome may occur following gastric surgery when a high osmotic
load is delivered to the jejunum. A history of lymphoma may be present
in immune-mediated hypoglycaemia.

[START_SECTION]Examination may reveal classic signs of hypoglycaemia. Look for
complications of diabetes. Look for evidence of chronic liver disease in
alcoholics. Pituitary insufficiency may lead to a variety of examination
findings depending upon the deficiency and may include hypotension,
loss or gain of weight, breast atrophy, hypogonadism, weakness, central
obesity or dry skin. Retroperitoneal tumours may lead to renal
impairment. Look for features of chronic liver disease.
Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly may be apparent in
Hodgkin’s disease.

Investigations
■ BM stix
↓ glucose.
■ Blood glucose
Hypoglycaemia.
■ LFTs
↑ bilirubin and transaminases with liver failure.
■ Toxicology screen
Alcohol.
■ U&Es
↑ urea and creatinine with renal failure associated with retroperitoneal
disease.
■ Insulin and C-peptide levels
Normal or ↑ insulin (insulinoma, sulfonylurea treatment). Absent Cpeptide with exogenous insulin.↓insulin (non-pancreatic neoplasm,
insulin receptor antibodies), alcohol, pituitary or adrenal failure.
■ Pituitary hormone levels
Reduced in pituitary failure (e.g. GH (growth hormone), TSH, LH, FSH,
prolactin).
■ Prolonged oral glucose tolerance test
To identify dumping syndrome.
■ i.v. insulin suppression test
Insulinoma.

[START_SECTION]■ Arterial stimulation with venous sampling
Insulinoma.
■ CT/MRI
Insulinoma.
• Profound hypoglycaemia is an emergency with potentially
serious sequelae. It can be easily and rapidly identified by a
BM stix glucose estimation.

[START_SECTION]Hypocalcaemia
Hypocalcaemia is a serum calcium of<2.0 mmol/L with an ionised
fraction<0.8 mmol/L.

Causes
Associated with High Serum Phosphate
• Renal failure
• Hypoparathyroidism
• Rhabdomyolysis
• Phosphate therapy

Associated with Low or Normal Serum Phosphate
• Hypomagnesaemia
• Acute pancreatitis
• Critical illness including sepsis, burns
• Osteomalacia
• Overhydration
MASSIVE BLOOD TRANSFUSION DUE TO CITRATEBINDING
HYPERVENTILATION WITH RESPIRATORY
ALKALOSIS AND REDUCTION IN IONISED PLASMA
CALCIUM

Drugs
• Bisphosphonates
• Calcitonin

[START_SECTION]Symptoms and Signs
Circumoral paraesthesia, peripheral tingling and paraesthesia, cramp,
tetany (carpo-pedal spasm), hypotension, hyperactive tendon reflexes,
Chvostek’s sign (tapping over the facial nerve causes facial spasm),
Trousseau’s sign (inflating blood pressure cuff to above systolic
pressure causes carpal spasm), laryngospasm (life-threatening), cardiac
arrhythmias and rarely dystonia and psychosis.

Investigations
■ Serum calcium and phosphate
Ca ↓ PO4 may be low, normal or high.
■ U&Es
↑ creatinine ↑ urea. Renal failure.
■ ABGs
pH ↑ (hypocalcaemia associated with respiratory alkalosis).
■ Serum amylase
Ca ↓ associated with acute pancreatitis.
■ Serum magnesium
↓ Mg – magnesium deficiency may lead to hypocalcaemia.
■ PTH levels
Hypoparathyroidism.
■ Serum Vitamin D
Vitamin D deficiency.
■ ECG
Prolonged QT interval.
• The first symptom of hypocalcaemia is circumoral
paraesthesia. If this occurs after thyroid or parathyroid
surgery, it is an indication for an urgent check of the serum
calcium and appropriate treatment.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Hypomagnesaemia
The normal range of serum magnesium is 0.7–1.0 mmol/L.
Hypomagnesaemia refers to a serum level below 0.7 mmol/L.

Causes
Excessive Losses
• Diuretics
• Severe diarrhoea
• Prolonged vomiting
• Polyuria (poorly controlled diabetes)
• Prolonged and excessive nasogastric aspiration

Inadequate Intake
• Starvation
• Alcoholism
• Malabsorption syndrome
• Parenteral nutrition

Symptoms and Signs
Symptoms of low magnesium levels are very similar to those of low
calcium with muscle weakness, lethargy, irritability, confusion, seizures
and arrhythmias. In addition, there may be co-existing symptoms due to
hypocalcaemia or hypokalaemia. Severe symptoms do not usually occur

[START_SECTION]until serum levels drop below 0.5 mmol/L.

Investigations
■ Serum magnesium
Serum magnesium level is diagnostic and can indicate level of severity.
■ U&Es
↓ K+ (Mg+ and K+ tend to move in and out of cells in the same direction).
■ Serum Ca
↓ Ca (present in up to 60% of cases).
• If symptoms related to hypocalcaemia and hypokalaemia
are resistant to calcium and potassium supplements,
respectively, remember to check the serum magnesium level.

[START_SECTION]Metabolic Acidosis
Metabolic acidosis is caused by increased production of hydrogen ions
from metabolic causes or from excessive bicarbonate loss (pH ↓, HCO3−
↓).
Compensatory mechanisms are:
■ ↓ pCO2 by hyperventilation
■ ↓ H+ by kidneys (unless in renal failure).

Causes
Excessive Production of H+
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Lactic acidosis secondary to hypoxia, e.g. shock, ischaemic
gut
• Septicaemia
• Starvation
• Drugs, e.g. ethanol, salicylates

Decreased H+ Excretion
• Renal failure

Excessive Loss of Base
• Diarrhoea
• Fistula – pancreatic, intestinal or biliary

Excessive Intake of Acid
• Parenteral nutrition

[START_SECTION]Symptoms and Signs
These may be non-specific. Specific symptoms include chest pain,
palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss.
Deep rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations) classically associated
with diabetic ketoacidosis. Extreme acidosis may result in lethargy,
stupor, coma, seizures, arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia.

Investigations
■ Arterial blood gases
pH usually<7.35. Bicarbonate usually<12 mmol/L.
■ FBC
WCC ↑ in sepsis, infarction, septicaemia.
■ U&Es
↑ K+.
■ Blood glucose
↑ in diabetic ketoacidosis.
■ Serum salicylate
Salicylate poisoning.
To distinguish between the main types of metabolic acidosis it is
necessary to measure the anion gap.

This is normally about 8–16 mmol/L. An elevated anion gap,
i.e.>16 mmol/L, may indicate a particular type of acidosis.

Increased anion gap
■ Lactic acidosis.
■ Ketoacidosis.
■ Chronic renal failure.
■ Intoxication, e.g. salicylate, ethanol, ethylene glycol, metformin.
■ Massive rhabdomyolysis.

[START_SECTION]• Rapidly increasing metabolic acidosis over minutes or
hours is not due to renal failure. Severe sepsis, tissue
hypoperfusion or tissue necrosis should be suspected,
especially when there is an associated clinical deterioration.

[START_SECTION]Metabolic Alkalosis
Metabolic alkalosis is caused by an increase in HCO3− or decrease in H+
(↑ pH,↑HCO3−). Compensatory mechanisms are:
■ ↑ pCO2 by hypoventilation (limited by hypoxia)
■ ↓ HCO3− by kidneys.

Causes
Excess Loss of H+
• Vomiting
• Nasogastric aspiration
• Gastric fistula
• Diuretic therapy (thiazide or loop)
• Cushing’s syndrome (mineralocorticoid effect)
• Conn’s syndrome (mineralocorticoid excess)

Excessive Intake of Base
• Antacids, e.g. milk-alkali syndrome
• Ingestion of HCO3− (usually iatrogenic)

Symptoms and Signs
The patient is usually asymptomatic, although if breathing
spontaneously will hypoventilate.

[START_SECTION]Investigations
■ Blood gases
pH>7.54 confirms diagnosis. HCO3− normally high>29 mmol/L.
■ U&Es
K+, Na+ and CI− usually fall below normal range.
■ Plasma cortisol
Diurnal variation lost in Cushing’s syndrome.
■ Plasma aldosterone
Raised in Conn’s syndrome.
• Metabolic alkalosis will cause a left shift of the
oxyhaemoglobin curve, reducing oxygen availability to the
tissues.

[START_SECTION]Respiratory Acidosis
Respiratory acidosis is caused by CO2 retention due to inadequate
pulmonary ventilation (↓ pH,↑pCO2). Compensatory mechanisms are:
■ ↑ HCO3− by bicarbonate buffer system
■ ↓ H+ by kidneys (can take several days).

Causes (Any Cause of Hypoventilation)
Cns Depression
• Head injury
• Drugs, e.g. opiates, anaesthetics
• Coma
• Stroke
• Encephalitis

Neuromuscular Disease
• Myasthenia gravis
• Guillain–Barré syndrome

Skeletal Disease
• Kyphoscoliosis
• Ankylosing spondylitis
• Flail chest

Artificial Ventilation (Uncontrolled and
Unmonitored)
Impaired Gaseous Exchange

[START_SECTION]• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
• Alveolar disease, e.g. pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory
distress syndrome)
• Thoracic injury, e.g. pulmonary contusions

Symptoms and Signs
A history of the underlying disorder may be evident such as trauma or
drug ingestion. The symptoms of respiratory acidosis can range from
anxiety, disorientation, confusion, or lethargy to somnolence. On
examination, tachycardia and a bounding arterial pulse can occur with
carbon dioxide retention. In severe disease, cyanosis and hypotension
can result. Papilloedema may be a feature of underlying raised
intracranial pressure. Features of a flail chest or any severe chest wall
deformity may be evident.

Investigations
■ ABGs
pH<7.35.
pCO2>5.8 kPa.
↑ HCO3−.
■ CXR
Underlying pulmonary disease.
■ Pulmonary function tests
COPD, which usually manifests as an obstructive defect (FEV1 ↓, FVC
normal). Skeletal disease (reduced chest movement).
■ EMG and nerve conduction studies
Myasthenia gravis and Guillain–Barré syndrome.
■ CT/MRI head
Central (brain stem) lesion.

[START_SECTION]• Associated hypoxaemia secondary to hypoventilation is the
major threat to life and must be reversed rapidly.

[START_SECTION]Respiratory Alkalosis
Respiratory alkalosis is a common disorder in critically ill patients. It
occurs when carbon dioxide is lost via excessive pulmonary ventilation
(↑ pH,↓PCO2). Compensatory mechanisms are:
■ ↓ HCO3− by bicarbonate buffer system
■ ↑ H+ by kidneys (slow process – may take several days).

Causes (Any Cause of Hyperventilation)
Central Nervous System
• Pyrexia
• Pain
• Anxiety
• Hysteria
• Head injury
• Stroke
• Encephalitis

Respiratory Disorders
• Pneumonia
• Pulmonary oedema
• Pulmonary embolus

Physiological
• Pregnancy
• High altitude
• Severe anaemia

[START_SECTION]Drugs
• Salicylates

Other Causes
• Sepsis
• Mechanical ventilation
• Metabolic acidosis (overcompensation)

Symptoms and Signs
Symptoms may include light headedness, circumoral paraesthesia,
dizziness and numbness of the hands and feet. Acute development of
low carbon dioxide levels can occasionally cause cerebral
vasoconstriction leading to confusion, syncope, fits.

Investigations
■ ABGs
pH>7.45.
PCO2<4.4 kPa.
↓ HCO3− (compensatory mechanism due to bicarbonate buffer system).
■ Serum calcium
↓ Ca2+ (due to increased calcium binding to serum albumin).
■ Serum salicylate level
If overdose is suspected.
■ CT/MRI head
Intracranial lesion as a cause of hyperventilation.
• Prolonged artificial ventilation with inadequate monitoring
should be remembered as a cause of respiratory alkalosis.

[START_SECTION][START_SECTION]Urea (Blood)
Blood urea is a useful test of renal function. However, other factors such
as liver failure, dehydration and protein breakdown may alter levels of
blood urea. The normal level of blood urea is 2.5–6.6 mmol/L. However,
values may be lower in pregnancy and the newborn, and in the elderly,
values may be slightly increased due to lack of renal concentration.

Causes
Increased Blood Urea
• Renal failure (acute and chronic)
• Dehydration
• Shock
• Congestive cardiac failure
• Gastrointestinal haemorrhage (digested blood increases
blood urea)
• Excessive protein intake
• Excessive protein catabolism

Decreased Blood Urea
• Malnutrition
• Liver failure
• Overhydration, e.g. prolonged i.v. fluids
• Pregnancy (increased plasma volume)
• Impaired protein absorption
• SIADH
• Anabolic steroid use

[START_SECTION]Symptoms and Signs
■ Signs of uraemia, e.g. oliguria, anuria, fatigue, confusion, thirst,
bronze colour of skin, oedema (peripheral and pulmonary), uraemic
frost (rare)
■ Signs of dehydration, e.g. dry skin, loss of skin turgor
■ Signs of congestive cardiac failure, e.g. oedema, JVP ↑. GI
haemorrhage, e.g. tachycardia, hypotension, haematemesis and
melaena. Decreased intake, e.g. oedema, ascites
■ Signs of liver failure. SIADH, e.g. head injury, small cell lung cancer.

Investigations

[START_SECTION]Anaemia
Anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin concentration of<13.5 g/dL in men
and<11.5 g/dL in women. Classification of anaemia according to red cell
indices is useful because specific investigations can be tailored
accordingly.

Causes
Microcytic (MCV<80 fL)
• Iron deficiency
• Anaemia of chronic disease
• Thalassaemia (more common in certain groups)

Normocytic (MCV 80–95 fL)
• Acute blood loss
• Haemolytic anaemia
• Hereditary spherocytosis
• Sickle cell disease (most common in sub-Saharan Africa)
• G6PD deficiency (varies with ethnicity)
• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
• Malaria (geographic variability)
• Drugs (e.g. dapsone, quinine, sulphonamides)
• Red cell trauma (burns, mechanical heart valves)
• Mixed deficiencies
• Secondary anaemia (liver and renal disease)
• Bone marrow failure
• Pregnancy

[START_SECTION]Macrocytic (MCV>95 fL)
• Megaloblastic anaemia
• Pernicious anaemia
• Vitamin B12 deficiency
• Folate deficiency
• Alcoholism
• Liver disease
• Hypothyroidism
• Hyperthyroidism (Graves’ disease)
• Addison’s disease
• Marrow infiltration
• Drugs, e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate.

Symptoms and Signs
Important aspects of the history are to enquire about symptoms
suggestive of the diagnosis of anaemia, and to establish any underlying
cause.

Symptoms of anaemia
The symptoms of anaemia are dependent on the degree of anaemia,
speed of onset, age and the presence of co-existing disease. Mild to
moderate chronic anaemia may be asymptomatic in young, fit
individuals. Symptoms of anaemia include tiredness, lethargy and
dyspnoea. Anaemia can precipitate or worsen angina and lower limb
claudication.

History of the underlying disorder
Blood loss is a common cause of iron deficiency anaemia and frank
bleeding can easily be established from the history. Occult bleeding

[START_SECTION]from the gastrointestinal tract is an important cause of chronic blood
loss. Patients may have melaena and may also experience upper
abdominal pains from peptic ulceration, gastritis, gastro-oesophageal
reflux or gastric carcinoma (p. 3). The causes of lower gastrointestinal
bleeding are detailed on p. 399. The amount and frequency of blood loss
with menstruation should be documented and the presence of
haemoptysis and haematuria should be ascertained. Malabsorption can
cause a deficiency of substrate or coenzyme requirements for the
synthesis of haemoglobin. Gastrectomy or atrophic gastritis with
pernicious anaemia may impair both iron and vitamin B12 absorption
due to alterations in pH and effects on intrinsic factor, respectively.
Impairment of vitamin B12 absorption may also result from extensive
disease or resection involving the terminal ileum and predisposes to
megaloblastic anaemia. A history of travel to areas where malaria and
hookworm infections are endemic should be sought.

Dietary history
It is important to take a dietary history, as folate deficiency results from
poor dietary intake. This is in contrast to iron, as dietary deficiency of
iron alone rarely results in anaemia unless accompanied by increased
utilisation or blood loss. Owing to intrinsic stores of vitamin B12, dietary
deficiencies may take up to two years before becoming clinically
apparent. The amount of alcohol intake should also be noted because
alcohol excess may result in a macrocytic anaemia.

Past medical and drug history
A number of chronic diseases can result in anaemia but it is important to
exclude other concomitant causes before attributing anaemia to the
effects of the primary illness. Diseases predisposing to macrocytic
anaemia have been listed above. Aplasia of the marrow may occur as a
complication of viral hepatitis or exposure to radiation and result in
aplastic anaemia. Drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents,

[START_SECTION]chloramphenicol and sulphonamides may also precipitate bone marrow
failure. Respiratory tract infections with mycoplasma, infectious
mononucleosis, lymphomas and connective tissue disease are associated
with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.

Family history
Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease may
be inherited. Alternatively, hereditary enzyme defects (G6PD) or red cell
membrane defects (hereditary spherocytosis) may also result in
intravascular haemolysis.

Examination
Classically, patients with anaemia have pallor of the palmar skin
creases and conjunctivae; however, diagnosis based solely on these
findings is unreliable. With iron deficiency, spoon-shaped nails
(koilonychia) may be noted; these findings may be accompanied by
angular cheilitis and glossitis. Jaundice can be a complication of
haemolytic anaemia or can result from chronic liver disease.
Subacute combined degeneration of the cord is a complication of
severe vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological examination reveals
symmetrical loss of light touch, vibration and proprioception of the feet
due to dorsal column involvement. In addition, Romberg’s sign may be
elicited. Less common features are peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy
and dementia.
With anaemia, examination of the cardiovascular system may reveal
evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation with tachycardia, bounding
pulse and a systolic flow murmur.
Splenomegaly is associated with hereditary spherocytosis,
thalassaemia and sickle cell disease.

Specific Investigations

[START_SECTION]Microcytic anaemia
■ FBC and blood film
Low haemoglobin concentration occurs with microcytosis (MCV<80 fL)
and hypochromia (MCH<27 pg). The platelet count may be raised when
anaemia is associated with acute bleeding. Microcytic, hypochromic red
blood cells with accompanying pencil cells may also be seen on the
blood film.
■ Serum iron and TIBC
Serum iron reduced and TIBC raised with iron deficiency. With chronic
disease, both are reduced and with thalassaemia, both are normal.
■ Serum ferritin
Concentration of serum ferritin, a protein-iron complex, will be reduced
with iron deficiency. It is not affected by chronic disease or
thalassaemia.
■ Faecal occult blood and faecal microscopy
Detects blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract. Hookworm ova can be
identified on microscopy.
■ Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin
Iron is added to protoporphyrin to form haem; therefore, in the presence
of iron deficiency, protoporphyrin levels will be raised. It is a sensitive
indicator of iron deficiency and is unaffected by chronic disease or
thalassaemia.
■ Hb electrophoresis
Allows the specific diagnosis and classification of thalassaemia and
sickle cell disease.

Normocytic anaemia
■ FBC and film
Low haemoglobin levels are accompanied by normal red cell indices
(MCV 80–95 fL, MCH>27 pg), which can also occur in the presence of
co-existing microcytic and macrocytic anaemia (mixed deficiency),
although this will usually be picked up on the blood film. Certain
haematology laboratories report RDW, which is increased in the

[START_SECTION]presence of differing red corpuscle sizes. The reticulocyte count will be
increased with haemolytic anaemia and following acute blood loss, and
the blood film may reveal evidence of damaged red cells or sideroblasts.
■ Tests for haemolysis
Unconjugated bilirubin, urine urobilinogen and faecal stercobilinogen
are raised with all causes of haemolysis. Serum haptoglobins are absent.
Plasma haemoglobin is raised specifically with intravascular
haemolysis. Reference to haematology textbooks will be required for
confirmatory tests for individual haemolytic disorders.
■ Urinalysis
Haemosiderin and haemoglobin will be present in the urine, specifically
with intravascular haemolysis.
■ Bone marrow aspiration
Aspiration of the bone marrow will reveal erythroid hyperplasia with
haemolytic anaemia; with aplastic anaemia, bone marrow hypoplasia
with fat replacement results.

Macrocytic anaemia
■ FBC and film
Low haemoglobin is accompanied by macrocytosis (MCV>95 fL). The
reticulocyte count is low and accompanying low platelet and white cell
counts may indicate megaloblastic anaemia. Hypersegmented
neutrophils may be seen on the blood film.
■ Serum vitamin B12 assay
Serum levels of vitamin B12 can be estimated and deficiency readily
ascertained. If the aetiology of vitamin B12 deficiency is not apparent, a
Schilling test can be performed to clarify if the problem lies within the
stomach, terminal ileum or is due to intrinsic factor.
■ Antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies
Pernicious anaemia results from lack of intrinsic factor production or
blocking antibodies.
■ Serum and red cell folate
Both of these tests are low with folate deficiency; however, in the

[START_SECTION]presence of vitamin B12 deficiency, the red cell folate may actually be
increased.
■ Bone marrow aspiration
Megaloblasts are seen in marrow aspirates with vitamin B12 or folate
deficiency.
■ Further tests
Further tests for individual diseases responsible for macrocytosis or
secondary anaemia need to be tailored according to the clinical
presentation.
• Examination of the peripheral blood film is an important
guide to the type of anaemia, the underlying cause and the
response to treatment.
• Remember that shortness of breath may be an early
presenting symptom of anaemia.

[START_SECTION]Clotting Disorders
Congenital disorders of clotting usually present with complications
related to prolonged blood loss, whereas acquired disorders are usually
discovered during coagulation testing.

Causes
Congenital
• Haemophilia
• von Willebrand’s disease

Acquired
• Vitamin K deficiency
• Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
• Obstructive jaundice
• Fat malabsorption
• Liver disease
• Autoimmune diseases, e.g. SLE
• Drugs – heparin, warfarin, thrombolytic therapy
• DIC
• Massive transfusion

Symptoms and Signs
Onset and duration

[START_SECTION]The duration of symptoms and age of presentation is very useful in
determining the underlying aetiology. Bleeding in the first few days of
life occurs as a result of deficient vitamin K synthesis by the neonatal
liver, due to immaturity. Patients with haemophilia usually present at a
young age with excessive blood loss following injuries or surgical
procedures, such as circumcision. Muscle haematomas and painful
haemarthroses may be accompanying features.

Past medical history
Concomitant disease constitutes the majority of causes of acquired
coagulation disturbances. As coagulation factors are synthesised in the
liver, disease of the liver naturally predisposes to clotting abnormalities.
Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for the production of
clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Conditions, such as obstructive
jaundice, pancreatic or small bowel disease, that impair the absorption
of fat will result in decreased production of the aforementioned factors.
Patients with SLE may produce antibodies such as the lupus
anticoagulant, which, although prolongs clotting in in-vitro testing,
predisposes to thrombosis in vivo.
Severe infections, malignancy, obstetric complications and burns may
give rise to DIC. This is characterised by widespread consumption of
clotting factors and platelets, resulting in severe coagulation
disturbances.

Drug history
Coagulation abnormalities may be iatrogenic. Therapeutic
anticoagulation is achieved with heparin and warfarin. Thrombolytic
agents produce severe derangement of clotting as a side-effect of
therapy. Coagulation disturbances can result from dilution from
massive blood transfusions (when the patient’s entire circulating volume
has been replaced by transfusion within 24 hours).

Examination

[START_SECTION]Examination
A general examination is performed to identify any stigmata from
haemophilia. Early-onset osteoarthritis and pseudotumours may result
from episodes of repeated haemorrhage. Skin necrosis and haematomas
may be seen with warfarin overdosage. In acquired coagulation
disorders, signs of liver disease may bring attention to the underlying
disorder.

General Investigations
■ FBC
Low platelet count or abnormal platelet function result in prolonged
bleeding time but not clotting results.
■ Clotting screen
PT, APTT and TT are measured. Abnormalities are listed in the Table
below.

PT, prothrombin time; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; TT, thrombin time; N, within normal range.

■ Bleeding time
Allows the differentiation of a primary clotting disorder (normal
bleeding time) and platelet disorders causing prolonged bleeding.

Specific Investigations
■ Clotting factor assays
Clotting factor assays are required to differentiate between haemophilia
A, haemophilia B and von Willebrand’s disease. Low levels of factor VIII
are found in both haemophilia A and von Willebrand’s disease. Low
levels of factor IX indicate haemophilia B. As the name implies, von
Willebrand’s factor is low in von Willebrand’s disease and the bleeding
time is also prolonged.

[START_SECTION]■ Fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products
With DIC, the platelet count and serum fibrinogen levels are low,
whereas the fibrin degradation products such as D-dimers are increased.
• Prolonged bleeding can result from abnormal platelet
function, despite normal platelet counts.

[START_SECTION]Leucocytosis
Leucocytosis is an increase in the absolute count of circulating white
blood cells. The normal range is 4–11 × 109/L. It may involve any of the
types of white cells, but a polymorphonuclear leucocytosis, i.e.
neutrophilia, is the most common.

Symptoms and Signs
It is important to seek a history of symptoms of infection and to examine
the patient for signs of infection or an underlying haematological
malignancy. A full description of the signs and symptoms of
haematological disease is beyond the scope of this book and the reader
is referred to a textbook of haematology.

• In patients with leucocytosis it is important to seek a history
of symptoms of infection and to examine the patient not only
for signs of infection, but also for the possibility of an
underlying haematological disorder, i.e. exclude
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.

[START_SECTION]Leucopenia
Leucopenia is a reduction in circulating white blood cells. The normal
range is 4–11×109/L. In practice, the common form is neutropenia – a
deficiency of neutrophil granulocytes. Neutropenia may be selective or
part of a pancytopenia.

Symptoms and Signs
The history and physical examination provide a guide to the subsequent
management of a patient with neutropenia. Simple observation is
appropriate initially for an asymptomatic patient with an isolated mild
neutropenia who has an unremarkable history and examination. Take a
full drug history. Check for any recent infections or surgery. Check
particularly for recent viral illnesses. Severe leucopenia may result in
opportunistic infections. Patients with neutropenia may present with
recurrent stomatitis, gingivitis, oral ulceration, sinusitis and perianal
infection.

Investigations

Hb ↓ in malignancy, bone marrow depression. WCC ↓ – type of white
cell involved.

life-threatening sepsis, e.g. candidiasis, septicaemia,
opportunistic infections. Patients in this group require febrile
illnesses treated with broad spectrum i.v. antibiotics.

[START_SECTION]Polycythaemia
Polycythaemia is an increase in red cell concentration above the normal
limit, usually accompanied by a corresponding increase in haematocrit
and haemoglobin concentration. Polycythaemia can be ‘real’ due to a
true increase in red cell concentration or ‘apparent’, due to low plasma
volume (e.g. dehydration). Primary polycythaemia (polycythaemia vera)
is due to a neoplasm of the myeloid series and secondary polycythaemia
is due to raised erythropoietin levels and may be appropriate (chronic
low oxygenation) or inappropriate (erythropoietin production from
renal tumours).

Causes
True Polycythaemia (Increased Red Cell Mass)
• Primary polycythaemia
• Polycythaemia vera
• Secondary polycythaemia
• Appropriate erythropoietin production (hypoxia)
• Smoking (due to carbon monoxide exposure)
• Chronic respiratory disease
• Long-term exposure to high altitude
• Cyanotic heart disease
• High-affinity haemoglobinopathy
• Inappropriate erythropoietin production
• Renal carcinoma or cysts
• Renal artery stenosis
• Renal amyloidosis

[START_SECTION]• Hepatocellular carcinoma
• Massive uterine fibroids
• Cerebellar haemangioblastoma

Apparent Polycythaemia (Reduced Plasma Volume,
Normal Red Cell Mass)
• Low plasma volume polycythaemia
• Dehydration
• Burns
• Enteropathy
• Gaisböck’s syndrome

Symptoms and Signs
The condition may be asymptomatic for months or years. Presenting
features of polycythaemia vera are fatigue, aquagenic pruritus (skin
itching after a hot bath), sweating and, occasionally, weight loss.
Patients may also present with complications such as stroke, deep vein
thrombosis or hyperviscosity (headache, blurred vision and confusion).
On examination, there is plethora and, occasionally, cyanosis. Scratch
marks or spontaneous bruising may be visible on the skin. The
conjunctival vessels are engorged and dilated retinal veins may be
evident on funduscopy. Splenomegaly may be palpable on examination
of the abdomen.

Investigations
■ FBC
Hb 17.5 g/dL in men and 15.5 g/dL in women with accompanying rise in
red cell count. Haematocrit>55% in men and 47% in women.
Thrombocytosis and neutrophil leucocytosis present in up to 50% of
cases of polycythaemia vera.
■ Blood film

[START_SECTION]Occasional metamyelocytes and myelocytes on blood film and
polycythaemia vera.
■ Serum uric acid
↑ uric acid in polycythaemia vera due to increased cell turnover.
■ ABG
O2 concentration in blood is normal in primary polycythaemia but
reduced in secondary polycythaemia, due to respiratory failure or
cardiac disease with right to left shunt.
■ Total red cell volume
Red cells, in a sample of blood from the patient, are tagged with 51Cr,
and the labelled red cells are re-injected. The dilution of the isotope in a
subsequent venous blood sample is used to calculate the red cell mass.
The normal range is 25–35 mL/kg in men and 22–32 mL/kg in women.
In the presence of ongoing blood loss (there is a predisposition to
bleeding and peptic ulceration), iron-deficient polycythaemia results
and the haemoglobin and haematocrit may be normal or low. The
condition should be suspected when there are obviously iron-deficient
red cells (low MCV) without anaemia and with a very high red cell
count.
■ Plasma volume
125
I-albumin is used to estimate total plasma volume, the normal range is
35–45 mL/kg. This is usually performed in conjunction with the
estimation of total red cell volume to distinguish between real and
apparent polycythaemia (the latter is due to low plasma volume).
■ Bone marrow aspiration
In polycythaemia vera, there is a hypercellular bone marrow with
erythroid hyperplasia. Megakaryocytes may be prominent and
increased reticulin deposition is common.
• In polycythaemia vera, the higher the haematocrit, the
greater the risk of thrombotic episodes. Repeated phlebotomy
is required to maintain the haematocrit below 45%.

Thrombocytopenia is a low platelet count below 150×109/L. The causes
of a low platelet count can be grouped according to reduced production,
decreased survival or sequestration in the spleen.

Causes
Reduced Production
• Aplastic anaemia
• Drugs, e.g. tolbutamide, alcohol, cytotoxic agents
• Viral infections, e.g. EBV, CMV
• Myelodysplasia
• Bone marrow infiltration, e.g. carcinoma, leukaemia,
myeloma, myelofibrosis
• Megaloblastic anaemia
• Hereditary thrombocytopenia

Decreased Platelet Survival
Immune
• ITP
• Drugs, e.g. heparin, quinine, sulphonamides, penicillins,
gold
• Infections
• Post-transfusion

Non-Immune
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

[START_SECTION]• Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
• Haemolytic uraemic syndrome

Hypersplenism
• Sequestration of platelets

Symptoms and Signs
Drug history including over-the-counter drugs, e.g. quinine. Alcohol
intake. Easy or spontaneous bruising, petechial rash, epistaxis,
haematuria, mucosal bleeding. Cirrhosis/hypersplenism. History of
malignancy with marrow infiltration. DIC.
Petechiae and bruising on examination. Signs of infection.
Lymphadenopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly.

Investigations
■ FBC
Isolated thrombocytopenia is likely to be due to increased destruction.
Thrombocytopenia due to marrow failure is likely to be associated with
anaemia, leucopenia.
■ Blood film
Red cell fragmentation (DIC). Platelet size (large in ITP and some
hereditary conditions). WBC (atypical lymphocytes/lymphoblasts).
■ Bleeding time
Prolonged if platelet count<80×109/L.
■ Coagulation screen
Clotting times normal in autoimmune thrombocytopenia but may be
abnormal in other causes, e.g. DIC.
■ Platelet function test
Associated abnormal platelet function, e.g. uraemia.
■ Serology
Antinuclear antibodies (autoimmune disease). Monospot (glandular

[START_SECTION]fever). Antiplatelet antibodies (unreliable). Paul–Bunnell test (glandular
fever). CMV serology.
■ U&Es, creatinine
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
■ LFTs
Hepatitis, e.g. due to EBV, CMV.
■ Bone marrow
Megakaryocytes increased in number and size in ITP. Absence or
reduction in megakaryocytes rules out ITP. Aplastic anaemia.
Leukaemia. Marrow infiltration (carcinoma, lymphoma, myeloma).
• Primary haemostasis is only impaired when platelet count
falls to<80×109/L.
• Spontaneous bruising, purpura and mucosal bleeding are
rare until the platelets are<20×109/L, unless there is also a
defect in platelet function.
• Always take a careful and detailed drug history.
• In the pale patient with purpura, a serious underlying bone
marrow disorder is likely.

[START_SECTION]Thrombocytosis
Thrombocytosis is a high platelet count>450×109/L. It may be secondary
to another pathological process or it may be due to a myeloproliferative
disorder.

Causes
Reactive (Secondary)
• Haemorrhage
• Haemolysis
• Trauma
• Surgery
• Postpartum
• Chronic inflammation, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease
• Iron deficiency anaemia
• Infection
• Malignant disease
• Hyposplenism (splenectomy, splenic atrophy)

Essential (Primary)
• Essential thrombocythaemia (myeloproliferative disorder)
• Other chronic myeloproliferative disorders, e.g. chronic
myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis, polycythaemia rubrum
vera.

[START_SECTION]Symptoms and Signs
History of trauma, blood loss, surgery, splenectomy, chronic
inflammatory disease. Infection and malignancy. Increased platelet
count at routine blood test. Episodes of spontaneous arterial or venous
thrombosis, e.g. stroke, DVT, venous thromboembolism.
Hepatosplenomegaly.

Investigations
■ FBC
Platelets ↑. Hb ↓ (iron deficiency anaemia). Hb ↑ (polycythaemia
rubrum vera). MCV ↓ (iron deficiency anaemia). PCV ↑ (polycythaemia
rubrum vera). WBC ↑ (infection, chronic myeloid leukaemia).
■ Blood film
Microcytic hypochromic anaemia in iron deficiency. Thrombocytosis,
giant platelets, platelet clumping, megakaryocyte fragments in essential
thrombocythaemia.
■ ESR
Chronic inflammation. Malignancy. ESR very high in myeloma.
■ Serum iron and TIBC
Serum iron ↓ TIBC ↑ in iron deficiency.
■ Serum ferritin
Reduced in iron deficiency. Not affected by chronic disease.
■ Bone marrow
Essential thrombocythaemia – hypercellularity, increased
megakaryocytes, large megakaryocytes. Polycythaemia rubrum vera –
increased cellularity due to hyperplasia for erythropoietic cells,
granulocytopoietic cells and megakaryocytes. Chronic myeloid
leukaemia – marked hypercellularity due to myeloid hyperplasia.
Myelofibrosis – ‘dry tap’ (aspiration unsuccessful).
• In myeloproliferative disorders associated with
thrombocytosis, there is not only an increased risk of

[START_SECTION]thrombosis but also an increased risk of haemorrhage.
• Platelet counts over 750×109/L are serious enough to
warrant investigation and treatment.

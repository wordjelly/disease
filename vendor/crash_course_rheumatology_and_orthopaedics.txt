Preface

It has been estimated that musculoskeletal problems are responsible for one in four GP
consultations. No matter what medical or surgical career you choose to follow, you are
guaranteed to be exposed to patients with orthopaedic or rheumatological conditions.
Despite this, teaching in these specialities can be neglected in the undergraduate curriculum.
As a medical student going home for Christmas you will be asked for an opinion on your
mate’s injured knee, your auntie’s bunions and your father’s sciatica. (All these scenarios
happened to us!) Hopefully this book will prepare you for these embarrassing situations!
The book is designed to give medical students a head start on the wards and make the
exciting world of orthopaedics and rheumatology fun and easy to learn. It is also of use to
foundation doctors (and will help pass your workplace based competency assessments!),
physiotherapists, occupational therapists and nurses.
We hope you enjoy the book, pass your exams, and then follow a career in orthopaedics
or rheumatology.

More than a decade has now passed since work began on the Crash Course series. Medicine
never stands still, and the work of keeping this series relevant for today’s students is an
ongoing process. This second edition builds upon the success of the preceding books and
incorporates a great deal of new and revised material, keeping the series up to date with the
latest medical research and developments in pharmacology and current best practice.
As always, we listen to feedback from the thousands of students who use Crash Course and
have made further improvements to the layout and structure of the books. Each chapter
now starts with a set of learning objectives, and the self-assessment sections have been
enhanced and brought up to date with modern exam formats. We have also worked to
integrate material on communication skills and gems of clinical wisdom from practising
doctors. This will not only add to the interest of the text but will reinforce the principles
being described.
Despite fully revising the books, we hold fast to the principles on which we ﬁrst developed
the series: Crash Course will always bring you all the information you need to revise in
compact, manageable volumes that integrate pathology and therapeutics with best clinical
practice. The books still maintain the balance between clarity and conciseness, while
providing sufﬁcient depth for those aiming at distinction. The authors are junior doctors
who have recent experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the
material is checked by senior clinicians and faculty members from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Objectives
In this chapter you will learn to:
• Recognize important features in the history and examination for back pain.
• Give a differential diagnosis for back pain including sinister causes and know how to
investigate these.
• Recognize patterns of upper limb and neck pain in order to be able to make an
accurate diagnosis.
• Understand the relevant anatomy of the knee and ankle and be able to list a
differential diagnosis for pain.
• Know how to investigate regional pain in the spine, upper and lower limbs
appropriately.

BACK, HIP AND LEG PAIN
One of the most common presentations to a GP is
that of back, hip and/or leg pain. 80% of the population will have an episode of back pain at some
time in their lives.
The patient may have one or any combination of
the three symptoms. An important point to note is
that many patients do not know where the hip joint
is and most will point to the iliac crest or further
posteriorly towards the sacroiliac joint and tell you
this is their hip! Other misconceptions abound: one
patient may tell you his sciatica is playing up or
another that her slipped disc has ‘popped out
again’.
So when faced with such a patient the physician
must decide, on the basis of the history and examination, whether the pain is from the back or the hip
joint and if what the patient is telling you is
correct!

Differential diagnosis
•
•
•
•
•
•

Simple low back pain (see Ch. 21).
Osteoarthritis (see Ch. 8).
Hip.
Spine.
Prolapsed intervertebral disc (see Ch. 21).
Rheumatoid or other inﬂammatory arthritis
(see Chs 9 and 10).

•
•
•
•
•
•

Vertebral crush fracture (see Ch. 12).
Avascular necrosis of hip.
Spinal stenosis/spondylolisthesis (see Ch. 21).
Malignancy (see Ch. 20).
Discitis (see Ch. 21).
Abdominal causes (referred, e.g. pancreatitis/
dissecting aortic aneurysm).
• Trochanteric bursitis.
• Paget’s disease.

History focusing on back,
hip and leg pain
There are essentially four different presentations
(Fig. 1.1):
•
•
•
•

Back pain.
Back and leg pain.
Hip pain with or without leg pain.
Leg pain.

Back pain
Simple low back pain
Acute low back pain without radiation into the leg
suggests simple low back pain—particularly if the
patient gives a history of lifting or straining, and the
pain is worse on movement and activity (so-called
‘mechanical pain’). The pain is usually described as
a band across the back and may be extremely
severe.

Regional pain
Fig. 1.1 Patterns of pain around the
back, leg and hip.

Hip

Sciatica

Signs of sinister back pain
Figure 1.2 shows ‘red ﬂag’ signs that should alert the
clinician to the possibility of serious spinal pathology. Malignancy such as spinal metastases is not
uncommon. A history of fever might suggest discitis.
Night sweats and weight loss are associated with
malignancy and also tuberculosis.
Pain may radiate to the back from intra-abdominal
pathology.

Beware of ‘yellow ﬂag’ signs.
These are based on
psychosocial factors which can
increase the chronicity of back
pain. Examples include a patient’s negative attitude
that back pain is harmful and disabling. Ongoing
compensation proceedings regarding a back injury,
depression, social and ﬁnancial problems, or an
expectation that passive treatment such as bed rest
is better than active treatment can also have
adverse effects on prognosis.

Back and leg pain
Back and leg pain suggests that there is nerve root
entrapment.

Fig. 1.2 Red ﬂag signs of sinister back pain.

Sciatica
True sciatica radiates down the back of the leg and
into the foot. It may be of acute onset from a speciﬁc
incident, and is typically constant with acute exacerbations lasting seconds. The nature of the pain is
like an electric shock and can be very severe. It is
aggravated in certain positions such as standing
straight and by sneezing or coughing and relieved
by bending forward with the knee ﬂexed. Over time
the pain usually settles.
Spinal stenosis
In spinal stenosis the patient typically has back pain,
and the leg pain comes on after walking and is
relieved by rest and leaning forward, so called spinal
claudication.

Back, hip and leg pain
Facet joint osteoarthritis
Facet joint osteoarthritis of the spine can also radiate
into the leg but the pain does not extend below the
knee and is aching in character.
Hip pain with or without leg pain
True hip joint pain is felt in the groin and can radiate
down the front of the thigh to the knee. The pain of
an arthritic hip is of gradual onset, deep and
gnawing. It can be unrelenting and persistent. Night
pain may be present.
A fractured hip is a common emergency presentation in elderly patients. Usually there is a clear
history of a fall but this is not always the case, particularly in confused patients.
Leg pain
Occasionally a prolapsed intervertebral disc presents
with leg pain only (sciatica) without the back pain.
Loss of function/degree of disability
Patients will complain of limitation of certain activities, which may be recreational, work related or
more basic activities of daily living.
It is important to know how much impact the
disorder has on normal day-to-day living.
Back pain is the leading cause of sickness from
work.
Associated symptoms
It is essential to ask about urinary or bowel disturbance in any patient with back pain. Incontinence of urine or faeces suggests a cauda equina
syndrome needing urgent investigation and surgical
decompression.
Numbness, pins and needles and weakness of the
foot should be elicited in the history and suggest
true sciatica.
Weight loss and a history of previous malignancy
indicate possible malignancy.

1

• A very stiff spine may be simple low back pain
or ankylosing spondylitis.
• Fixed ﬂexion of the hip with an antalgic or
Trendelenburg gait is likely to be hip pathology.
There may be a limb length discrepancy.
• Look for deformity of the spine, previous scars,
wasting and any lower limb deformity.
Perform the Trendelenburg and Thomas tests as
described in Chapter 27. These are tests aimed at
examining the hip and, if positive, suggest hip
pathology.

Palpation
• With the patient standing, palpate the spine and
surrounding muscles for tenderness. In simple low
back pain, often the area around the posterior
superior iliac spine and sacroiliac joint is tender.
• The hip is too deep to palpate but feel around
the greater trochanter for bursae.

Movement
• Assess movements of the spine. Diminished
movement is likely if pathology is present. It
may be impossible for the patient to comply
because of pain.
• Hip movements will be reduced if an arthritic
process is present. Usually internal rotation and
abduction are the ﬁrst to be lost.

Special tests
Straight leg raising will be diminished with a positive sciatic stretch test if the nerve root is irritated by
a prolapsed disc or spinal stenosis.
A peripheral nervous system examination may
show weakness and sensory loss in a single nerve
root pattern.

Examination focusing on back,
hip and leg pain

Investigation of a patient with
back, hip and leg pain

General examination

Blood tests

Look at the patient: weight loss, anaemia and general
ill-health may suggest malignancy.
Look at the posture and gait:

These are not always necessary but should be performed to exclude sinister causes in patients over 55
years of age or as guided by clinical suspicion.
Full blood count may reveal:

• A stooped posture with ﬂexion of the knee
suggests sciatica.
• A frail old lady with a stooped posture may
have osteoporotic fractures.

• Raised white cell count if infection is present
such as in discitis.
• Anaemia in malignancy.

5

Regional pain
Biochemistry is required only to exclude abdominal
causes and help conﬁrm cases of malignancy.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Creactive protein (CRP) are elevated in infection
and malignancy.
• Patients presenting with metastatic disease and an
unknown primary need thorough investigation.
Biopsy specimens should be taken at surgery.
• Alkaline phosphatase is elevated in Paget’s
disease.

Plain X-ray
This may show:
• Normal appearances in simple low back pain,
prolapsed disc and even in malignancy or
infection if early in the disease process (it is
therefore not a good screening test and some
departments have stopped routine spinal X-rays
in young patients).

The winking owl sign occurs when
the pedicle is destroyed due to
metastasis. The missing ‘eye’
represents bony destruction of the
pedicle by tumour, so always look
closely at the pedicles.

6

• Osteoarthritic changes in the hip and spine.
• A spondylolisthesis.
• Destruction of the vertebral body, classically the
pedicle (winking owl sign) (Fig. 1.3), indicating
malignancy.
• Fracture.
• Erosion of vertebral body around the disc due
to infection.
Further special tests may be needed if there is doubt
about the diagnosis or to plan surgery:
• Isotope bone scanning: hot spot in infection
and malignancy.
• CT scanning: for looking at bony structures in
detail, e.g. spondylolisthesis.
• Magnetic resonance imaging: useful for looking
at soft tissue structures, including identiﬁcation
of disc prolapse and nerve root prior to surgery;
and early detection of malignancy and
infection.

and 1.5.

KNEE PAIN
Knee pain is a very common presenting complaint,
accounting for over a third of all referrals to orthopaedic surgeons.

Differential diagnosis
• Osteoarthritis (see Ch. 8).
• Meniscal injuries (see Ch. 22).
• Ligament injury.

• Rheumatoid or other inﬂammatory arthritis
(including crystal arthritis).
• Referred from hip or spine.
• Osteochondritis.
• Bursitis (see Ch. 24).
• Septic arthritis (see Ch. 16).
• Anterior knee pain/patellofemoral disorders.

History focusing on knee pain
The ﬁrst thing to consider is the patient’s age
and occupation. A young athletic patient with a
recent injury is unlikely to have rheumatoid arthritis
(think of meniscal/ligamentous injuries). Similarly
an elderly patient with gradual onset of pain over
many years will most likely have an arthritic
process.

The characteristics of the pain will give clues to
the underlying diagnosis.

Site of pain
Pain can be generalized or localized.
Generalized pain (‘all over’) suggests an arthritic
process affecting the whole joint. Large effusions
such as after an injury or in sepsis also give a tense
painful joint.
Localized pain depends on the site. Commonly
painful areas around the knee are shown in Figure 1.6.

8

• Anterior: patellofemoral pain is felt here. Pain
is felt at the front of the knee in prepatellar
and infrapatellar bursitis as well as the obvious
diagnosis of anterior knee pain.
• Medial or lateral: localized pain to either joint
line could be osteoarthritis (particularly so
in varus knees on the medial joint line) or
from meniscal tears and collateral ligament
sprains.
• Posterior pain is less common but could be
related to a large Baker’s cyst or bursitis.

Fig. 1.6 Anatomical structures in the knee that cause pain.

• Pain down the back of the knee could be
referred from the spine.
• Pain down the front of the thigh and into the
knee suggests hip pathology.
The mode of onset is usually gradual, over a few
weeks or months. If there is a sudden onset the most
likely cause is an injury to the knee such as a meniscal tear or fracture. A history of spontaneous pain
over days is most likely due to septic or crystal
arthritis but could signal a ﬂare-up of inﬂammatory
conditions.
Pain and stiffness in the morning improving
through the day suggest an inﬂammatory arthritis.
Pain originating from knee pathology rarely
radiates but hip pain is commonly felt in the knee,
particularly in children.

Nature of pain
Meniscal tear often gives a sharp stabbing pain.
Arthritic pain is usually a deep gnawing pain.
Constant pain that is not affected by activity is
often a feature of anterior knee pain.

Aggravating/relieving factors
Arthritic pain is generally worse on activity and
relieved by rest.
Classically patellofemoral pain is worse on
walking up or down stairs.

Meniscal tears may give more trouble in deep
ﬂexion or when twisting.
In an acute crystal or septic arthritis the pain
is intense and any movement exacerbates this
considerably.
Pain from prepatellar bursitis is worse on
kneeling.

Loss of function
Patients may have signiﬁcant disability due to their
knee pain. They may notice decreased movement or
loss of full extension.
Athletic patients with a meniscal tear or cruciate
ligament injury will tell you they don’t trust the knee
during certain sporting activities and may be unable
to do them at all.

Deformity (see Ch. 5)
Patients with arthritis may notice that they are gradually becoming more ‘bow-legged’ or ‘knock-kneed’.
A windswept deformity (one valgus knee and
one varus knee) is more common in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA).

Associated symptoms
It is important to ask some closed questions when
taking a history in a patient with knee pain.

9

Regional pain
Ask about any generalized symptoms of ill health
such as a fever.
Any history of injury is important, as often a
sportsman/woman will ignore a knee injury for
many years prior to seeking help. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) may have been torn, so take a
detailed history about what happened.

• Look for previous scars around the knee,
wasting (particularly quadriceps), swelling and
erythema.
• Swelling can be localized, such as a prepatellar
bursa (a boggy swelling in front of the knee) or
more generalized, such as an effusion.

• Ask if the patient heard a ‘snap’.
• Ask how long the swelling took to appear (very
sudden swelling suggests ACL rupture).
• Ask whether the patient could play on (unlikely
if signiﬁcant injury occurred).
• A history of locking suggests meniscal injury or
loose body.
• Giving way may be due to a ligamentous
problem such as ACL rupture.

Palpation

Past medical history
Of particular interest will be any previous operations or fractures to the knee, such as meniscectomy
or arthroscopy.

Drug history
Ask about medications such as analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Examination
As with any orthopaedic examination, the principles
are look, feel and move.
Remember to examine the other knee as a comparison. This will give you an idea of how lax they
are normally (this varies considerably) and how
much movement they have.

Remember to examine the hip when
examining the knee.

General inspection could reveal signs of rheumatoid arthritis.
Watch the patient walk into the room, look for
an antalgic or Trendelenburg gait.

Inspection
• Look at the patient on standing, as any
deformity will be more obvious. A varus
deformity is more common than a valgus one.

10

• Palpate for an effusion as described in Chapter
27.
• Palpate for tenderness around the knee; joint
line tenderness is common in a patient with a
meniscal tear. A meniscal cyst may also be
found.
• Palpate behind the knee for a bursa or Baker’s
cyst.
• Patellofemoral crepitus can be felt (and sometimes heard) on ﬂexing and extending the knee
in osteoarthritis.

Movement
• A locked knee results in lack of full extension
but often ﬂexion is normal. This can be quite
subtle so compare with the other side.
• Fixed ﬂexion deformity (common in
osteoarthritis) also causes loss of full extension
but the history is more gradual.
• Arthritis results in variable amounts of
decreased ﬂexion.
• See if any deformity is correctable.

Special tests (see page 199–201)
• Collateral ligament tears are apparent on
abnormal opening up of the joint on the
affected side.
• Anterior cruciate ligament laxity is
demonstrated by positive Lachmann’s and
anterior drawer tests.
• Posterior cruciate ligament laxity is seen as a sag
of the tibia at 90° and can be misdiagnosed as
an ACL tear when performing the anterior
drawer test (the abnormal forward movement
of the tibia is due to its sagging back in the ﬁrst
place).
• Maltracking of the patella can be seen when
observing the knee bending from ﬂexion to
extension (so-called J sign).
• Patella apprehension will be positive in a
patient with previous dislocation.

Investigations
Figure 1.7 provides an algorithm for the investigation of knee pain.

Blood tests
A full blood count (FBC) and measurements of ESR
and CRP should be performed in suspected cases of
infection and will show raised inﬂammatory markers
and a high white cell count (WCC).

X-rays
X-ray images should be taken standing (joint space
narrowing becomes more obvious) and include
anteroposterior (AP), lateral and skyline views.

The X-ray may:
• Conﬁrm rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.
• Show a fracture.
• Be normal.
Remember to consider an X-ray of the hip based on
your history and examination ﬁndings.

Further imaging
This is only warranted under certain conditions:
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): useful to
conﬁrm meniscal or ligamentous pathology.
• Computed tomography (CT): gives detailed
information on bony structures; also useful to
visualize patellar tracking.

11

Regional pain
• Isotope bone scanning: occasionally used if
unsure about diagnosis. It will show ‘hot spots’
due to increased activity in many conditions
including osteoarthritis, but also rarer causes
such as osteomyelitis and bone tumours. It is a
sensitive test but not speciﬁc. A normal bone
scan is reassuring if one suspects sinister
pathology.

Always send ﬂuid obtained to
microbiology for microscopy, culture and
sensitivities (M, C + S) and ask the
laboratory to look for crystals.

Aspiration
Aspiration of joint ﬂuid is a very simple method of
investigation and can give clues to the diagnosis.
Look at the ﬂuid obtained:
• Straw/yellow ﬂuid: likely to be a
simple effusion or possibly a crystal
arthropathy.
• Green or dirty ﬂuid: likely to be pus, and
septic arthritis is likely.
• Blood: a haemarthrosis occurs after injury or
occasionally in bleeding disorders or patients
on warfarin. Blood and fat globules
(a lipohaemarthrosis; Fig. 1.8) are present
in fracture or ACL rupture.

Such exploratory operations used to be very
common but now most surgeons will have a clear
idea about the diagnosis before operating in such
a way.
Often, based on clinical ﬁndings, the surgeon
is sure of the diagnosis and will operate without
the need for further investigations such as MRI
scanning. This is particularly true in a locked
knee.

ANKLE AND FOOT PAIN

Arthroscopy

Differential diagnosis

Knee arthroscopy involves ‘keyhole’ surgery to look
into the joint to see if there is any pathology.

The differential diagnosis of pain in the ankle and/
or foot is shown in Figure 1.9.

Lipohaemarthrosis

Presence of associated symptoms
• Back or knee pain suggest that the pain may be
referred.
• Coldness and pallor of the foot may be due to
peripheral vascular disease.
• Paraesthesiae or ‘burning’ pain can occur with
Morton’s neuroma, painful diabetic neuropathy
or tarsal tunnel syndrome.

Pain due to the following causes can
be felt at various sites in the foot:

Detailed past medical history

• tarsal tunnel syndrome
• referred pain from the back or knee

• Plantar fasciitis is associated with
spondyloarthropathies, so ask about a history
of psoriasis or inﬂammatory bowel disease.
• Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is rare in the ankle
or subtalar joints, so OA at these sites is usually
secondary to previous ankle instability or
fracture.
• Diabetes mellitus may be complicated by a
painful neuropathy.
• Smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus
are risk factors for peripheral vascular disease.

Hallux valgus
Hallux rigidus
Acute gout

Fig. 1.9 Differential diagnosis of ankle and/or foot pain.

History
The following points should be covered when taking
a history from patients with ankle or foot pain:

Site and chronological pattern of pain
(see Fig. 1.9)
• Recurrent self-limiting pain suggests crystal
arthropathy (e.g. gout).
• Chronic pain with soft-tissue swelling suggests
inﬂammation or infection.

It is important to enquire what
impact pain in the ankle or
foot has on a patient’s
function and lifestyle. Achilles
tendinopathy can ruin the career of an athlete, but
may interfere little with the activities of a patient
who leads a more sedentary lifestyle.

Presence of any precipitating factors
• Repetitive trauma due to running, jumping or
other athletic activities can predispose to
Achilles tendinopathy or plantar fasciitis
(‘policeman’s heel’).
• A recent illness or initiation of diuretic therapy
may trigger an acute attack of gout.

Examination

The ankle and foot should be inspected
during weight-bearing as well as in the
neutral position. Some clinical signs are
more obvious when the patient is standing.

Inspection
Inspection of the foot and ankle may reveal the following signs:
• Callus under metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints
(common in rheumatoid arthritis).

13

Regional pain
• Valgus deformity at the ﬁrst MTP joint (hallux
valgus).
• Erythematous swelling of a joint (acute gout or
inﬂammatory arthritis).
• Swelling in the region of the Achilles tendon
(Achilles tendinopathy).
• Ischaemic changes due to peripheral vascular
disease.
• Plaques of psoriasis.

Palpation
Palpation of the foot and ankle should assess the
following:
• Swelling: is it bony or soft?
• Joint tenderness.
• Tenderness of the plantar fascia and Achilles
tendon.
• Tenderness between the metatarsal heads
and/or the nodular swelling of a Morton’s
neuroma.
• Tenderness over the posterior tibial nerve
posterior to the medial malleolus (common
in tarsal tunnel syndrome).
• Strength of the peripheral pulses.

Movement
Movement of the foot and ankle should be compared to that on the opposite side. Passive dorsiﬂexion of the ankle will exacerbate the pain of
Achilles tendinopathy. Restriction of movement and
crepitus of the ﬁrst MTP joint is seen with hallux
rigidus.

Examination of other joints
This must include the knee, hip and lumbar spine.

Neurological examination
Neurological examination of the lower limbs is
essential if there is any suspicion that the pain might
be referred from the lumbar spine. Sensation should
be tested. Diabetic neuropathy will cause sensory
loss in a stocking distribution, whereas in Morton’s
neuroma it is localized to the borders of adjacent
toes. Tarsal tunnel syndrome usually causes numbness in the sole of the foot.

14

Investigations
Blood tests
• The ESR and CRP will be elevated in most cases
of inﬂammatory arthritis and crystal
arthropathy.
• Serum uric acid levels are usually raised during
acute attacks of gout.
• The ﬁnding of a positive rheumatoid factor in a
patient with synovitis is suggestive of
rheumatoid arthritis.

Radiological investigations
• Plain X-rays may show signs of an
inﬂammatory or degenerative arthritis.
• Ultrasonography can identify abnormalities of
the Achilles tendon and Morton’s neuromas.
• Magnetic resonance imaging can also be used
to assess tendons and neuromas. MRI of the
lumbosacral spine is the investigation of choice
in patients with ankle or foot pain that is
thought to be due to nerve root compression.

Synovial ﬂuid examination
Synovial ﬂuid examination under polarized light
microscopy should be performed if there are any
pointers to a crystal arthropathy, such as acute erythema, pain and swelling in the ﬁrst MTP joint,
midfoot or ankle.

Nerve conduction studies
These are useful in conﬁrming the diagnosis of tarsal
tunnel syndrome or peripheral neuropathy.

NECK AND/OR UPPER LIMB PAIN

Differential diagnosis
Figures 1.10–1.13 give the differential diagnoses
that should be considered when patients present
with neck, shoulder, elbow, or wrist and hand
pain.

Remember that pain in any bone or joint
can be due to trauma, sepsis or
malignancy.

Complex regional pain syndrome
This is also referred to as reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy, algodystrophy, or Sudeck’s atrophy. It is not
common, but can affect any part of the musculoskeletal system. It is included in this section, as
the distal forearm and hand are most often involved.
The key features are of pain, hypersensitivity and
autonomic disturbances, which can affect the integrity of the skin.

The following points should be covered when taking
a history from a patient with neck or upper limb
pain:

Onset of pain
• Subacute in polymyalgia rheumatica or crystal
arthropathy.
• Gradual in osteoarthritis.

History of recent trauma or
strenuous activity
• A fall on an outstretched hand, particularly in
an elderly person, may result in a Colles
fracture or rotator cuff tear.
• Trauma can trigger complex regional pain
syndrome.
• Unaccustomed repetitive upper limb use, such
as painting a ceiling, may provoke rotator cuff
tendinopathy or lateral epicondylitis.

The presence of any other
precipitating factors
• Raynaud’s phenomenon is provoked by cold
weather.
• Acute gout may be precipitated by the
introduction of drugs that affect the serum
urate level.

Site of pain
• The site of pain may give a clue to its origin.
Figure 1.14 shows how the site of shoulder
pain varies with the cause.
• Carpal tunnel syndrome causes pain in the
radial three and a half digits.

• A painful response to stimuli that do not
usually cause pain (e.g. light touch) is called
allodynia and occurs in complex regional pain
syndrome.
• Fever, weight loss and general malaise raise the
possibility of sepsis, malignancy or
inﬂammatory conditions such as polymyalgia
rheumatica.
• Some symptoms will give a clue to the presence
of disease that may be causing referred pain
(e.g. haemoptysis in a patient with a Pancoast’s
tumour).
A suggested algorithm for the examination and
investigation of patients with neck and/or upper
limb pain is shown in Figure 1.15.

Examination
Inspection
Inspection of the affected joint and surrounding
area is important. This may reveal:
Fig. 1.14 Many structures can give rise to shoulder pain.
These diagrams show how the site of pain varies with the
origin.

Movements that aggravate the pain
• Shoulder pain due to rotator cuff pathology
will be exacerbated by abduction of the
shoulder.
• Shoulder pain that is referred from the neck
will be exacerbated by neck movements.

Presence of associated symptoms
• Stiffness is found in inﬂammatory conditions
such as inﬂammatory arthritis or polymyalgia
rheumatica.
• Referral of neck pain to the upper limbs or the
presence of paraesthesiae may be due to cervical
nerve root irritation.
• Weakness or clumsiness of the lower limbs or
urinary symptoms may result from cervical cord
compression.
• Dizziness may occur as a result of vertebral
artery compression in severe degenerative
disease.
• Paraesthesiae usually accompany pain in
median or ulnar nerve entrapment.

16

• Loss of the normal cervical lordosis due to
cervical spondylosis or muscle spasm.
• Wasting of the shoulder muscles from chronic
rotator cuff tendinopathy.
• Shiny, erythematous swelling of the elbow or
wrist due to acute gout or pseudogout.
• Heberden’s or Bouchard’s nodes in
osteoarthritis.
• Synovial swelling of the small hand joints or
tendon sheaths in rheumatoid arthritis.
• Rheumatoid nodules.
• Plaques of psoriasis.
• Gouty tophi.
• Wasting of the thenar or hypothenar muscles
resulting from median or ulnar nerve
compression respectively.
• Ischaemic changes in the digits due to
Raynaud’s phenomenon.
• Changes in skin colour, with atrophy and
reduced hair growth as features of complex
regional pain syndrome.

Palpation
As well as accurately identifying tender structures,
palpation also helps in the assessment of swelling.
Hard, bony swelling as seen in osteoarthritis should
be distinguished from the softer boggy, synovial
swelling of inﬂammatory arthritis. Inﬂamed tendon

sheaths in the hand or wrist may feel thickened or
nodular and palpation may produce crepitus.

Assessment of joint movement
Assessment of joint movement is valuable in a hunt
for the source of pain.
• In the shoulder, a reduction in passive and
active movement suggests arthritis or capsulitis
of the joint. A reduction in active movement,
with normal passive movement, suggests a
rotator cuff problem.
• Movement of the elbow in lateral epicondylitis
will probably be normal, but resisted

dorsiﬂexion of the wrist will exacerbate the
pain.

Examination of other body systems
Neurological examination of the cranial nerves
and all four limbs is essential in a patient with neck
pain and any neurological symptoms. Cervical
radiculopathy and cord compression should be
excluded. Motor and sensory function of the median
and ulnar nerves should be assessed in cases of
hand and wrist pain (Fig. 1.16). Tinel’s and Phalen’s
tests may be abnormal in carpal tunnel syndrome
(see Fig. 25.3, p. 182).

Fig. 1.16 Nerve entrapment in the upper limb can cause
pain, paraesthesiae or sensory loss in the hand. The digit(s)
affected give a clue as to which nerve is involved.

Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory
and abdominal systems may reveal a source of
referred pain.

X-rays are of little value in cervical
spondylosis. There is poor correlation
between the severity of radiographic
signs and symptoms. Many people develop
radiographic signs of spondylosis with increasing
age, yet never suffer from neck pain.

Investigations
The choice of investigations depends on the clinical
examination ﬁndings. In some cases, the diagnosis
is obvious from examination and further investigation is not required. For example, a 75-year-old man
who complains of pain in his digits and has squaring of his ﬁrst carpometacarpal joint and Heberden’s
nodes has osteoarthritis. Plain X-rays will conﬁrm
the diagnosis, but will not alter his management in
any way.

Blood tests
• ESR and CRP may be raised in inﬂammatory,
infectious or malignant conditions.
• The ﬁnding of a positive rheumatoid factor in a
patient with synovitis is suggestive of
rheumatoid arthritis.
• Serum uric acid is likely to be raised in cases of
gout.

Synovial ﬂuid examination
• Polarized light microscopy may detect urate or
calcium pyrophosphate crystals.

18

Ultrasound scans
Ultrasound scanning can demonstrate thickening
and oedema of tendon sheaths in tenosynovitis.
MRI and CT scans
These are useful in the following circumstances:
• Imaging the cervical cord and nerve roots.
• Detecting rotator cuff inﬂammation or
degeneration.
Isotope bone scans
Isotope bone scans show increased tracer uptake
in areas of accelerated bone turnover, such as
inﬂammation, infection, malignancy or fracture.
The ﬁnding of a ‘hot spot’ should be followed by
MRI or CT scanning.
Nerve conduction studies
These can help to exclude cervical radiculopathy in
patients with neck pain and upper limb paraesthesiae. Those with abnormal nerve conduction should
proceed to an MRI or CT scan. Reduced nerve conduction velocities are seen in median and ulnar
nerve entrapment.

Widespread
musculoskeletal pain

2

Objectives
In this chapter you will learn to:
• List the causes of widespread musculoskeletal pain.
• Recognize how pain and stiffness due to inﬂammatory disease varies in severity
throughout the day.
• Select appropriate investigations for the assessment of patients with widespread
musculoskeletal pain.

Differential diagnosis

Timing of pain

Patients sometimes present with widespread musculoskeletal pain. The differential diagnosis is shown
in Figure 2.1.
The age, sex and race of the patient will give some
guide to the likely diagnosis. For example, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) rarely affects people under
the age of 60 years, ﬁbromyalgia and systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) are more common in women
than in men and osteomalacia is more prevalent in
Asian than in Caucasian populations.

As a rule, pain that is worse in the mornings and
improves throughout the day is more likely to be
inﬂammatory in origin.

Paraneoplastic rheumatic syndrome
This is a rare, but important, cause of musculoskeletal pain. Patients with lymphoma, leukaemia or
other malignancies sometimes present with rheumatic symptoms. These can mimic inﬂammatory
polyarthritis or PMR.

History
A thorough history should be taken, covering the
following points:

Onset of pain
A relatively sudden onset (over 1–2 days) is
common in PMR and can occur in inﬂammatory
arthritis. A more gradual onset (over days to weeks)
is more typical of the other diagnoses shown in
Figure 2.1.

Site of pain
Patients may ﬁnd it hard to distinguish whether
the pain is arising from their muscles or joints. In
ﬁbromyalgia, pain originates from the muscles
and soft tissues, but many patients will complain
that it is their joints that are hurting. Pain in the
region of the shoulder and pelvic girdles is typical
of PMR.

Presence of stiffness
Patients with musculoskeletal pain due to any cause
may complain of stiffness. Signiﬁcant stiffness that
is maximal in the mornings and lasts for more than
30 minutes suggests inﬂammatory arthritis, SLE or
PMR.

Associated symptoms
• Temporal headaches or jaw claudication are
suggestive of giant cell arteritis associated with
PMR.
• A history of skin rashes, mouth ulcers or
Raynaud’s phenomenon raises the possibility of
SLE.

Widespread musculoskeletal pain

Examination
Examination can help make the decision as to
whether the pain is arising from the joints, muscles
or soft tissues. The joints should be examined for
signs of inﬂammation. Power in all four limbs
should be measured and the soft tissues palpated for
areas of tenderness.
Examination of other systems is also important.
The presence of livedo reticularis and a facial rash
would suggest SLE, whilst the discovery of hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy would raise the suspicion of malignancy.

Investigation
Investigations should be guided by the examination
ﬁndings. It is important to remember that they may
be normal in the early stages of disease and should
be repeated if symptoms persist. For example, the
radiological signs of inﬂammatory arthritis may take
months to appear.

Blood tests
• The ESR is likely to be raised in cases of PMR,
inﬂammatory arthritis, SLE or malignancy.

2

• Serum calcium levels may be low in
osteomalacia.
• Parathyroid hormone levels should be checked
in the presence of hypercalcaemia to exclude
hyperparathyroidism.
• Serum alkaline phosphatase may be elevated in
osteomalacia. It can also rise in response to
inﬂammation.
• An immunology screen, including measurement
of antinuclear and anti-double-stranded DNA
antibodies and immunoglobulin levels, will be
abnormal in active SLE.
• Rheumatoid factor is found in the serum of up
to 90% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Radiological investigations
X-rays of the small joints may show the erosive
changes of inﬂammatory arthritis. Radiographs of
the long bones and pelvis should be taken if the
patient has risk factors for osteomalacia, such as
reduced sunlight exposure or intestinal malabsorption. Looser’s zones may be seen.
Other radiological tests (e.g. chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound scan) may be necessary if there is any
suspicion of malignancy.

An acute hot swollen joint

3

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Give a list of differential diagnoses for a hot swollen joint.
• Take a history from a patient picking out relevant details.
• Understand how to investigate a hot swollen knee.

Differential diagnosis
• Septic arthritis.
• Crystal synovitis.
—Gout
—Pseudogout.
• Inﬂammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis or
seronegative spondyloarthropathy).
• Transient synovitis.
• Haemarthrosis.
The phrase ‘acute hot swollen joint’ implies that the
patient has presented as an emergency with rapid
onset of symptoms and a large painful effusion.

History focusing on the acute hot
swollen joint
Pain
Patients with acute gout or septic arthritis classically
have very severe pain. However, it is difﬁcult to differentiate these conditions from other causes of hot
swollen joints as the majority of patients will present
with intense pain that is worse on movement.

• Gout commonly affects the ﬁrst
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint of the foot.
• Pseudogout is common in the knee and
wrist.
• Multiple joint involvement points to an
inﬂammatory disorder such as rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) or juvenile idiopathic arthritis
(JIA).

Is the patient ill?
Fever, night sweats, rigors and general ﬂu-like symptoms suggest likely infection but it is possible to
have the same symptoms in an acute ‘ﬂare-up’ of an
inﬂammatory arthropathy.

Previous history
This is likely in gout as 90% of patients with an
acute attack will have recurrent episodes.
It is unlikely in septic arthritis unless the patient
has a predisposing factor such as sickle cell disease
(see Ch. 18).

Patient age and sex
All of the above conditions could present in the
adult patient, whereas only septic arthritis, reactive
arthritis and possibly inﬂammatory arthritis are
likely causes in children.
Gout is more common in men, and rheumatoid
arthritis is more common in women.

Which joint?
Certain joints are more commonly affected by
speciﬁc disorders (Fig. 3.1):

Be careful. Patients with
known inﬂammatory or crystal
arthritis can present with joint
infection and due to the
effects of immunosuppressant drugs may not mount
the usual inﬂammatory response. As such the joint
may not have the typical features associated with
infection.

Associated symptoms

Past medical history

Patients with an inﬂammatory disorder may
have systemic features of the disease process such
as sacroiliac joint pain in ankylosing spondylitis
or painful metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints
in RA.
Eye symptoms can occur in:

Gout is linked with increased cell turnover and
therefore any illness can predispose to it due to
increase in breakdown products.
Patients with malignancy having chemotherapy
are particularly prone to gout due to vast numbers
of cells being ‘killed’ (see Ch. 14).
As mentioned in Chapter 18, certain conditions
also predispose to joint infection, e.g. intravenous
drug use (IVDU).
Patients with a bleeding disorder (such as haemophilia) or on warfarin are at risk of developing
an acute haemarthrosis (bleeding into a joint).
These patients can present in such a way with an
acutely swollen tender joint.

• Reiter’s syndrome (conjunctivitis).
• Rheumatoid arthritis (keratoconjunctivitis).
• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (uveitis).
Patients with a history of recent sexually transmitted
disease or diarrhoea are likely to have Reiter’s
syndrome.
Also consider gonococcal arthritis in patients
with a history of sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs).
A recent viral illness can result in a reactive
arthritis.

24

Drug history
Diuretics and low dose aspirin can increase uric acid
levels, predisposing to gout.

An acute hot swollen joint
Patients on steroids or other immunosuppressants are at increased risk of infection.

Social history
Alcohol excess predisposes to gout and high purine
diets also contibute.

Examination of a patient with an
acute hot swollen joint
General
• Most patients presenting in such a way will
look unwell, be uncomfortable and may be
agitated.
• A pyrexia suggests infection but mildly elevated
temperatures can be present in gout and
inﬂammatory arthritis.
• The patient should be examined for general
signs of inﬂammatory arthritis.
• Patients with gout may have gouty tophi; these
are commonly found on extensor surfaces of
the elbow and ﬁngers.

The joint
• The knee is the most commonly affected joint
overall.

3

• Any affected joint will have a tense effusion
and be exquisitely tender to any passive
movement.
• A full examination of the joint is unnecessary
and impossible!
• A thorough examination of other joints
should be performed to make sure the patient
has a monoarthritis (i.e. no other joints are
involved).

Investigation of a patient with an
acute swollen joint
An algorithm for the investigation of a patient with
an acute swollen joint is shown in Figure 3.2.

Blood tests
The aim of initial investigation is to conﬁrm or
exclude septic arthritis. Do not rely on blood tests
alone which may be normal.
• A raised white cell count (WCC) suggests
infection but can be raised due to inﬂammatory
causes.
• Inﬂammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP)
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can
be raised in all the conditions listed above,

An acute hot swollen joint
particularly septic arthritis and inﬂammatory
arthritis.
Normal inﬂammatory markers cannot completely
exclude infection.
• Serum urate may be elevated, normal or low in
patients with acute gout.
• Serum calcium should be checked as
pseudogout can be caused by
hyperparathyroidism.
• If haemarthrosis is suspected a clotting screen
should be performed and patients on warfarin
should have their international normalized
ratio (INR) checked.

X-rays
Plain X-rays of the affected joint may show:
• Normal appearances.
• Chondrocalcinosis (found in pseudogout due
to calcium deposition in menisci).
• Bony erosions associated with gout or
inﬂammatory arthritis.

26

Of all the investigations the most
important is aspiration of the joint.

Aspiration/synovial ﬂuid analysis
• A superﬁcial joint such as the knee is simple to
aspirate, particularly when there is a tense
effusion.
• Deeply situated joints such as the hip require
ultrasound or X-ray guidance.
• In every case ﬂuid aspirated must be sent to
microbiology for urgent microscopy, culture
and sensitivity (usually written as M, C and S).
In addition to this the technician should look
for crystals.
• The general appearance of the aspirate should
be described (see Chs 1 and 30).

Ultrasound
Ultrasound scanning is useful to detect an effusion,
particularly in the hip.

A child with a limp

4

Objectives
You should be able to:
•
•
•
•

Give a list of the most likely differential diagnoses according to the age of the child.
Understand what to look for on examination of the neonate, infant and child.
Investigate a child with a limp to rule out serious conditions.
Differentiate between an ill and a well child.

Differential diagnosis

Is the child ill?

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

To answer this question the general state of the child
must be noted. Systemically unwell children will
show little interest in play or food and simply will
not be themselves. Fever, rigors and night sweats
should be noted as well as duration of symptoms.
An unwell child suggests infection or juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Septic arthritis.
Irritable hip.
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).
Perthes disease.
Slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE).
Osteomyelitis.
Occult trauma.
Neuromuscular causes.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Malignancy (very rare).

History focusing on the child
with a limp
There is a big difference between an infant aged
15 months and an adolescent aged 15 years.
Infants will not give an accurate history and if very
unwell may be distressed and uncooperative. The
majority of children do, however, give a good
history.

Age
The most important factor in assessing a child with
a limp is the age of the child. Figure 4.1 shows the
likely differential diagnosis depending on the age of
the child.

Sex
The sex of the child can also give clues to the diagnosis; for example, Perthes disease is much more
common in boys than in girls.

Pain
Most children limp because of pain.
Any child complaining of knee pain must be suspected of having hip pathology.
The history in Perthes disease is often of a vague
gradual onset of pain and limp.
More sudden onset of pain is more likely due to
trauma or infection.
The classic history for a slipped upper femoral
epiphysis is often a background of hip pain for
weeks followed by sudden increase in pain.
Transient synovitis of the hip gives pain in the
groin and mimics septic arthritis.
Occasionally sinister causes of pain (such as bone
tumours) present with gradually increasing pain
(including night pain) not relieved by simple
analgesia.

Painless limp
• Late-presenting DDH presents with a limp and
leg length discrepancy.

• Neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy
result in poor gait due to muscle imbalance
rather than pain.
• Cerebral palsy can present as developmental
delay but milder forms can present later in
childhood as the weakness becomes more
apparent.
• Muscular dystrophy can also present with
gradual onset of weakness and limp.

Examining a child with a limp
General
Systemic features of ill-health such as pyrexia,
drowsiness and irritability should be noted and will
point towards infection as the cause.
Multiple joint problems may be obvious initially,
suggesting juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Neuromuscular disorders may be obvious or
detected on neurological examination.

Associated symptoms
History of injury may be elicited in occult trauma
but in non-accidental injury (NAI) this will not be
forthcoming.
Multiple joint aches and pains suggest juvenile
arthritis.
A recent history of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or otitis media is often found in patients
with transient synovitis.
In JIA the eyes can be involved as part of the systemic effects of the disease. If left untreated blindness can result.

Past medical history

Inspection
Gait
• An antalgic gait is present in painful conditions
such as Perthes or irritable hip.
• A Trendelenburg gait (see Ch. 27) is present in
a toddler with late DDH.
• Neuromuscular disorders give a variety of
patterns of gait abnormality.
• A worrying sign is a child too ill or in too much
pain to weight-bear.

Family history

Standing
• An abnormal single large posterior skin crease
is present in DDH.
• In slipped upper femoral epiphysis or
infection, the hip is often held in an abnormal
position of external rotation and ﬂexion
(Fig. 4.2).

A family history of Perthes disease and DDH also
leads to an increased risk.

Further inspection could reveal scars, swelling or
erythema.

Any previous history of Perthes disease or slipped
upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE) is very important
as these patients are at increased risk of developing
disease in the opposite hip.

28

4

A child with a limp

• Perthes disease results in loss of abduction and
ﬂexion. Complete loss of abduction is a
worrying sign in Perthes as this may indicate
subluxation of the joint.
• In septic arthritis any movement gives extreme
pain.

Investigating a child with a limp
Figure 4.3 provides an algorithm for the investigation of a child with a limp.

Blood tests

Left

rotated right leg in slipped upper femoral epiphysis.

Fixed ﬂexion
If the Thomas test is positive (a ﬁxed ﬂexion deformity) suspect signiﬁcant pathology such as advanced
Perthes, DDH or SUFE.
Limb length discrepancy
• A short leg is typical of DDH.
• Apparent shortening (see Ch. 27) will be
present if there is any ﬁxed ﬂexion deformity.

Markedly raised white cell count (WCC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein
(CRP) are present in infection but these inﬂammatory markers can also be mildly increased in synovitis or JIA.
Very rare causes of abnormal blood tests include
leukaemia. Creatinine kinase is raised in muscular
dystrophy.

X-rays
A plain X-ray is often unnecessary in the younger
child, particularly in cases of transient synovitis.
A hip radiograph may show:
•
•
•
•

A dislocated hip.
Perthes disease.
A slipped upper femoral epiphysis.
Evidence of infection (remember X-rays are
initially normal).
• A fracture.

Palpation
Palpate any tender areas for effusion, warmth and
localized pain.
Tenderness over the tibial tubercle is likely to be
due to Osgood–Schlatter disease.
The hip joint cannot be palpated because it is a
deep joint
Palpation around the knee will reveal joint line
tenderness in conditions such as osteochondritis or,
in older children, meniscal tears.

If a slipped upper femoral epiphysis is
suspected, request a frog lateral X-ray.

Movement

If you are sure the problem is from the knee then
anteroposterior (AP) and lateral knee X-rays should
be performed and may show:

• Loss of hip movements indicates pathology.
• DDH results in loss of abduction compared
with the other side.

• Osgood–Schlatter disease.
• Osteochondritis dissecans.
• A fracture.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound is a very useful investigation for suspected joint problems, particularly of the hip, which
is deeply situated.
The scan will show an effusion in:
• Septic arthritis.
• Transient synovitis.
• Perthes disease (early).

Isotope bone scanning
If hot, this is likely to be signiﬁcant and possible
causes are:

4

• Osteomyelitis—the scan will also show any
seeding of infection.
• Malignancy.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI is not a ﬁrst-line investigation in children but
is useful in:
• Diagnosis of knee disorders (see Ch. 22).
• Bone and soft tissue tumours.
• Osteomyelitis.

Deformity

5

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Describe clinical deformities of a limb.
• Understand how congenital and acquired deformity can occur.
• Give examples of common deformities.

Deﬁnition
A deformity is due to an abnormal alignment or
appearance of bone, joint or soft tissues.
A deformity can be correctable (able to return to
original position) or ﬁxed.
• Valgus deformity—bent away from the
midline.
• Varus deformity—bent towards the midline.
Valgus and varus deformities of the knee are
illustrated in Figure 5.1.

Causes of deformity
There are many causes of deformity and rather than
list all of them the different causes have been listed
as three groups, as follows:
1. Soft tissue:
—Scarring
—Swelling
—Wasting
—Overgrowth, e.g. Dupuytren’s contracture.
2. Bone:
a. Congenital
b. Acquired:
—Previous fracture
—Infection
—Tumours
—Metabolic bone disease, e.g. sabre tibia in
Paget’s disease
—Growth plate injury.
3. Joint:
—Contracture (e.g. Volkmann’s ischaemic
contracture)
—Muscle imbalance (e.g. polio)

—Chronic arthritis (varus knee in
osteoarthritis).

History focusing on deformity
Patients present with deformities for different
reasons:
• Pain (usually associated with arthritic
conditions).
• Disability (e.g. shortening of limb).
• Appearance (e.g. scoliosis).
Deformities in children are usually noted by the
parents and often these patients have normal variations of growth and simply need reassurance (see
Ch. 15).
It is important to recognize whether the deformity is due to a generalized disease process or only
affects one limb.
An important initial question would be to ask if
any other joints or limbs are involved.

Congenital deformities
Congenital deformities usually present at birth and
are noted at delivery, although some will now be
picked up on antenatal scanning.
An obstetric, birth and family history (the deformity could be present in siblings or either parent)
should be noted.
Patients (or parents, if a child) will usually tell
you they have ‘had it since birth’.
If this is the case ask what has changed to make
the patient seek help now.
The deformity may have progressed or become
painful.

33

Deformity

Genu varum

Genu valgum

Paget’s disease can also present with painful
deformity.
Painless deformity
Painless deformity is common with neurological
causes (such as ulnar claw hand) or in Dupuytren’s
disease.
Such conditions affecting the hand can cause signiﬁcant disability due to loss of function.
Following a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) a
patient has deformity due to muscle spasticity.

Fig. 5.1 Genu varum and genu valgum.

Cerebral palsy produces variable clinical deformities as the child grows.
Late presentation of developmental dysplasia of
the hip (DDH; see Ch. 15) can occur, in which case
the child will present with a limp.

Acquired deformities
Post-fracture, injury or sepsis

As a general rule deformities resulting
from injuries are unilateral (i.e. you
usually only injure one limb) and
deformities from arthritis are bilateral (e.g. hand
disease in rheumatoid arthritis).

This is usually progressive unilateral deformity following a speciﬁc injury.
Patients can often ‘manage’ very well with severe
deformity until many years after an injury and
then present with pain as secondary osteoarthritis
becomes symptomatic.
Painful deformities
A painful deformity suggests an arthritic process but
the patient is much more likely to present with pain
before deformity becomes apparent. Typical deformities are varus knees and Heberden’s nodes in
osteoarthritis.

34

Loss of function
There is a wide variation in the effects of the deformity on function. Simple things such as being
unable to wear a pair of shoes because of toe deformities can cause signiﬁcant disability. Patients with
severe Dupuytren’s disease have difﬁculty washing
their face (sometimes poking themselves in the
eye!).
Appearance
Often patients simply complain about the appearance of the deformity.
Scoliosis causes a prominent rib hump which is
unsightly, and as most patients are of adolescent age
signiﬁcant distress results. If very severe, spinal
deformity can result in chest complications due to
decreased expansion.
One of the most common deformities seen is
hallux valgus (bunions) and patients may ‘only’
complain that they have difﬁculty ﬁnding shoes to
ﬁt (not a good reason to operate)!
Associated symptoms
Generalized joint swelling and pain with deformity
suggest inﬂammatory arthropathy.
Progression of deformity
The timing of events is important. Patients may have
had the deformity for some years and present
because there has been sudden progression or interference with day-to-day activities.

Examination of a patient with
a deformity
There are features common to all deformities but
the majority involve assessment of a limb or digit as
described in Chapter 27.

Is the deformity correctable?
A deformity can be ﬁxed or mobile.

5

Deformity
• A mobile deformity will return to its original
position when stressed. Only joint deformities
can be mobile; an example is early varus
deformity in osteoarthritis of the knee.
• A ﬁxed deformity will not return to the original
position. Most deformities are ﬁxed. An
example of a ﬁxed deformity is a malunited
tibial fracture.

Is there an associated condition?
Examine the whole patient to look for any generalized conditions associated with deformities such as
an inﬂammatory arthritis.
• A patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may
have several typical deformities (usually in the
hand).
• Patients with psoriatic arthropathy often present
with very severe hand deformities (arthritis
mutilans).
• A patient with cerebral palsy needs regular
assessment, as deformity due to muscle
imbalance can lead to ﬁxed deformity (see Ch.
15, Fig 15.8) and secondary bone changes.

Common joint deformities
We will now look at each joint, looking for common
deformities.

Hand
Examination of the hand may show:

• Thickened palmar fascia with ﬁxed ﬂexion
deformity of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP)
and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints (most
commonly of the little and ring ﬁngers),
indicating Dupuytren’s disease (Fig. 5.2).
• Heberden’s nodes in osteoarthritis.
• Ulnar drift of the MCP joint, boutonnière
deformity and swan-neck deformity, indicating
rheumatoid arthritis.
• Ulnar claw hand.

Elbow
The most important deformities at the elbow are
cubitus valgus and cubitus varus (Fig. 5.3) and they
are usually secondary to childhood fractures (supracondylar fracture of the elbow).

Shoulder
• A dislocated shoulder results in an abnormal
contour (see Ch. 22).
• A winged scapula results from a long thoracic
nerve palsy and the scapula is lifted off the
chest wall on pushing forward.

Spine
• A torticollis (muscle spasm of the
sternocleidomastoid muscle) causes the head to
turn to the affected side.
• A kyphosis is a ﬂexion deformity of the spine
(Fig. 5.4).

• Fixed ﬂexion of the hip gives patients an
abnormal posture with the knee ﬂexed and they
often stoop to the affected side.

Knee
The knee is one of the most common sites for
obvious clinical deformity.

Fig. 5.4 A thoracic kyphosis.

• A scoliosis is a lateral and rotational curvature
of the spine.

• Varus or valgus knees can be constitutional
(inherited) or secondary to degenerative
change.
• Fixed ﬂexion deformity of the knee results in
loss of full extension and commonly occurs in
osteoarthritis.

Foot and ankle
Hip
• Hip conditions may present with leg length
discrepancy.

36

Deformities of the foot and ankle are also common
(Figs 5.5 and 5.6). Common deformities of the forefoot are shown in Figure 29.14 (p. 202).

Deformity

Investigation of a deformity
The majority of simple deformities need little or no
investigation.
• Blood tests. If inﬂammatory arthropathy is
suspected check erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid
factor (RhF), autoantibodies.
• Abnormal biochemistry is present in Paget’s
disease (see Ch. 12).

5

• X-rays. The joint or limb involved will usually
require X-ray examination.
• Nerve conduction studies are useful in assessing
deformity secondary to peripheral nerve injury,
e.g. ulnar claw hand.
• Computed tomography (CT) scans are
sometimes used to reconstruct complex
deformities (3-D CT reconstruction).

A limb swelling

Objectives
You should be able to:
•
•
•
•
•

Give a list of differential diagnoses for a limb swelling.
Take a focused history from a patient with a limb swelling.
Examine and describe a limb swelling.
Know how to investigate a limb swelling.
Recognize sinister features of a limb swelling.

Differential diagnosis
It is helpful to consider differential diagnoses in
relation to the anatomical location.
• Skin or subcutaneous:
—Rheumatoid nodule
—Lipoma
—Bursitis
—Neuroﬁbroma
—Cyst.
• Joint:
—Joint effusion
—Ganglion
—Baker’s cyst.
• Bone:
—Bone tumour
• Muscle/deep soft tissues:
—Sarcoma.
Patients commonly present with lumps, bumps
and swellings. The majority of these are benign, but
it is important not to overlook very rare tumours
presenting in this way.

History focusing on a swelling
The following points are important:
Duration of symptoms
How long has the patient had the lump or swelling,
and when did the patient ﬁrst notice it?
Increase in size
Has it increased in size recently or grown rapidly?
Tumours may present in this way.

Solitary or multiple
Does the patient have more than one lump or swelling and if so where? Neuroﬁbromata or rheumatoid
nodules are often multiple.
Variability
Does the swelling come and go and if so over what
period? Classically a ganglion will disappear and
then recur.
Is it painful?
A tense effusion will be painful, as may bursitis.
Deep pain related to a bony or soft tissue mass may
be sinister. The majority of such lesions are not
painful.
Loss of function
Does the swelling or lump inhibit the patient in any
way. Swellings around the hand can be a nuisance
to patients and those on the foot can rub when
shoes are worn.

Associated symptoms
Usually there will be none.
The general health of the patient should be ascertained with weight loss, fatigue and poor health
being sinister symptoms.
Occasionally large swellings or masses can compress vessels or nerves, e.g. osteochondroma.
Patients presenting with joint swelling may have
other symptoms related to the underlying disease
process, such as pain in the joint if arthritic.
A patient may have painless joint swelling as a
presenting feature of a more generalized inﬂamma-

39

A limb swelling
tory condition. It is important therefore to ask about
other joints such as those in the hand.
A patient with a Baker’s cyst may have pain in the
knee.

Diffuse or discrete
Some swellings are large without clear margins and
appear to merge with the surrounding structures,
whereas others are more easily palpable.

Occupational history

Surface
Is the surface of the lesion smooth or irregular?

Patients who kneel frequently, such as carpet ﬁtters,
are very prone to developing prepatellar bursitis.

Patients will often think that
their swelling is a cancer. Ask
them if they are worried
about it and if you are sure it
is nothing to worry about (as the vast majority are)
then tell them! Often patients don’t mind having a
small lump such as a lipoma or ganglion and just
need reassurance.

Examination focusing on
a swelling
The affected area or joint should be examined and
also the local lymph nodes.
The following points relate to a swelling or mass
rather than a joint effusion, which should be obvious
on clinical examination.
When examining a lump or swelling the following points should be elicited.
Site
Which limb is affected and where is the lesion?
Size
Sinister pathology should be suspected in any lump
larger than 5 cm.
Skin
• Is the lesion within the skin, in the
subcutaneous tissue or deep to the fascia?
Painful deep lesions are suspicious and need
investigation.
• Is the skin normal over the lesion, inﬂamed or
abnormal?
Consistency
Is the lesion soft, ﬁrm or hard? A lipoma is often
described as ﬁrm.

40

Mobile or ﬁxed
A discrete mass may be ﬁxed to the underlying
structures, like a ganglion, or more mobile, e.g. a
lipoma.
Fluctuance
Fluctuant lesions contain ﬂuid, such as a Baker’s
cyst.
Pulsatile
Pulsatile and
aneurysms.

expansile

lesions

are

vascular

Transillumination
Fluid-ﬁlled or soft lesions (e.g. lipoma) will transilluminate when tested with a pen torch if the ﬂuid
is clear.

The patient presenting with joint
swelling only
This has been covered in Chapters 2 and 3.
Occasionally a patient will present with swelling
of a single large joint and this can be the onset
of a generalized condition such as rheumatoid
arthritis.
Therefore examine other joints such as the hand
(if rheumatoid arthritis is suspected) or the spine
(if ankylosing spondylitis).

Investigation of a patient with
a swelling
We will consider joint swelling as a separate condition from a discrete swelling or mass.

Joint swelling (effusion)
Exclude infection (see Ch. 3).
Blood tests should be carried out, including
rheumatoid factor and autoantibodies to look for
inﬂammatory arthritis.
X-rays may show osteoarthritis/rheumatoid
arthritis or be normal.
Synovial ﬂuid analysis is performed for gout and
pseudogout.

Further investigation may be unnecessary.
For example, a patient has a cystic lesion on the
volar aspect of the wrist, which comes and goes and
is ﬁxed to deep structures. The lesion is ﬁrm, smooth
and transilluminates. This patient has a ganglion
and this can be conﬁrmed by aspirating jelly-like
ﬂuid.
Further investigation is necessary if there is doubt
about a diagnosis.
• If bony pathology is suspected an X-ray of the
affected limb should be performed. A benign or
malignant bony lesion may be found.

Refer to
specialist

• A deeply situated soft tissue lesion may be
a sarcoma and if so needs further
investigation.
• An initial ultrasound scan may be useful to
conﬁrm the presence of a mass and whether it
is ﬂuid ﬁlled or solid.
• However, an MRI scan with contrast gives detail
regarding the exact nature of the lesion.
• If doubt still exists, the patient should be
referred to a specialist sarcoma service and the
next step would be a biopsy.
• An algorithm for the investigation of a limb
swelling is given in Figure 6.1.

An incidental bone lesion
on X-ray

7

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Describe a bone lesion on X-ray.
• Understand the difference between benign and malignant lesions on X-ray.
• Investigate a patient with an incidental bone lesion on X-ray.

It is quite common for patients to present with bony
lesions on X-ray. These are usually incidental ﬁndings (the X-ray was taken for another reason such as
minor trauma and an abnormality is found) and
cause great concern to patients.
Examples include a chest X-ray taken for respiratory disease showing a lesion in the clavicle or a
pelvic X-ray taken for hip disease showing metastatic prostate carcinoma.

Differential diagnosis of a lesion
on X-ray
Benign lesions are quite common.
Primary bone malignancy is extremely rare.
Secondary bone tumours are common in the
elderly.
Infection can present as a bone lesion.

Benign tumours/disorders
•
•
•
•
•

Osteochondroma.
Osteoid osteoma.
Enchondroma.
Bone cysts.
Fibrous dysplasia.

Malignant tumours
• Primary:
—Osteosarcoma
—Ewing’s sarcoma
—Chondrosarcoma.
• Secondary—metastatic deposit:
—Breast
—Lung
—Prostate

—Renal
—Thyroid
—Bowel.
• Haemopoietic diseases:
—Myeloma
—Lymphoma.

Infection
• Osteomyelitis.

Metabolic bone disease
• Paget’s disease.

Describing bone lesions on X-ray

Practise describing bone defects and
lesions whenever possible.

1. Name and age of patient.
2. Site—which bone and where in the bone:
• The lesion can be in the diaphysis (shaft),
metaphysis (cancellous bone between the
growth plate and shaft) or epiphysis
(between the growth plate and the joint).
• The lesion can primarily affect either the
cortex or medulla of the bone.
3. Appearance:
• The lesion can be lytic (e.g. breast
metastasis) (Fig. 7.1), sclerotic (e.g. prostate
metastasis), mixed or calciﬁed
(enchondroma).

43

An incidental bone lesion on X-ray

Fig. 7.2 Fibrous dysplasia (from Klippel J H, Dieppe P A
(eds) 1998 Rheumatology, 2nd edn. Mosby, London).

Fig. 7.1 Lytic lesion (proximal radius) is suggestive of
malignancy.

• Ground glass (ﬁbrous dysplasia) (Fig. 7.2).
• Abnormal bony architecture, e.g.
post-osteomyelitis.
4. Zone of transition:
• A well-deﬁned border between the lesion
and the normal bone suggests a benign
slow-growing lesion (it is clearly
demarcated).
• A broad, irregular or indistinct zone of
transition where the change from abnormal
to normal is poorly deﬁned suggests a
malignant process (Fig. 7.3).
5. What is the bone doing in response?
• A signiﬁcant periosteal reaction with
Codman’s triangle (see Fig. 22.4, p. 159),
onion skinning and sunray spicules
(Fig. 7.4) is a feature of malignancy.
• Infection can also cause a periosteal
reaction.

44

6. What is the lesion doing to the bone?
• Cortical destruction is typical of a malignant
process.
• Cortical thinning does occur in benign
disease due to expansion.

History of incidental
X-ray ﬁnding
When the patient returns following the X-ray the
following points must be elicited in the history,
looking for clues as to the diagnosis.

Age of patient
Certain lesions such as bone cysts are more common in children, and other benign bone lesions
such as enchondroma usually occur in young
adults.
Overall, primary malignant tumours are very
rare and metastatic bone disease is a disease of the
elderly.

Pain
Although the patient may not have offered pain as
a symptom initially, when a lesion is discovered the
patient must be asked if the area is painful. The

An incidental bone lesion on X-ray
patient may have ignored any pain or just put it
down to ‘arthritis playing up’.
Pain that is severe and does not respond to simple
analgesia, particularly if night pain is a feature, suggests a malignant process.

Swelling
Benign lesions are more likely to present with
swelling, particularly osteochondroma, a lesion
commonly found around the knee.
Malignant tumours may have pain and swelling
but it is rare for a bone tumour to present with
swelling only.

General health
General features of ill-health such as tiredness,
weight loss, poor appetite and fever suggest a
systemic illness such as malignancy, haemopoietic
disorders or infection.
Primary bone malignancy is unlikely to present
with widespread features of malignancy as patients
will usually present with pain and swelling before
these general features have developed.
It is important to ask about any other areas of
pain in the musculoskeletal system, particularly if
considering widespread metastatic disease.

Past medical history
A previous history of carcinoma is extremely important when dealing with such a patient. The lesion
should be treated as a metastatic lesion until proven
otherwise.
Breast malignancy can be dormant for many
years prior to re-presenting with metastases.

Examination focusing on a
patient with an X-ray
abnormality

Tenderness, redness and swelling would be
present in:
• Impending or actual fracture associated with a
bone metastasis.
• Osteomyelitis.
• Osteoid osteoma.
• Malignant primary bone tumour.
Malignant secondaries or bone lesions from haemopoietic diseases rarely show any external features.

Generalized
In secondary malignancy with unknown primary, it
is important to examine:
• Breast (for carcinoma).
• Chest (for lung tumours).
• Abdomen (for renal or bowel tumours and
evidence of haemopoietic disease such as liver
and spleen enlargement).
• Per rectum (PR) (prostate).
• Thyroid (for carcinoma).

Investigation of a bone lesion
on X-ray
The X-ray
It is important to obtain two views taken at 90° to
one another and to obtain full-length views of the
entire bone (to ensure there are no further lesions
along the same bone).
Most benign lesions need no further investigation and repeat X-rays after 6 months are useful to
ensure the bone lesion does not change in appearance and develop any sinister features.

Further investigation
Further investigation is only necessary if there is
doubt about the diagnosis or to conﬁrm or exclude
malignancy.

Site
Different lesions are more common in certain locations, for example enchondromas are more common
in the hand.
Secondary bone metastases tend to be found in
the central skeleton.

Limb examination
Examination of the affected limb will usually be
normal.

46

It is not uncommon for
patients to present with a
lesion on X-ray to ﬁnd they
have metastatic disease from
an unknown primary. Make sure this news is broken
in the right way, preferably once all the information
is available and with relatives and nursing staff
present.

An incidental bone lesion on X-ray
Blood tests
• A full blood count (FBC) may show anaemia of
chronic disease.
• Liver function tests (LFTs) could be deranged if
liver metastases are present.
• The calcium proﬁle is often raised in
generalized malignancy, and alkaline
phosphatase is raised in Paget’s disease.
• C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) are raised in infection
or malignancy.
• A very high ESR suggests myeloma. It is
conﬁrmed with serum electrophoresis and
urinary Bence Jones proteins.
• Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) is elevated in
prostate malignancy.
• Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is elevated in
bowel carcinoma.
Isotope bone scan
This is a very useful tool to detect further lesions in
malignancy or to see if a lesion is active (i.e. hot on

7

bone scan). Infection will show up ‘hot’ as will
malignant lesions.
Of the benign lesions only osteoid osteoma will
show increased uptake.
Computed tomography (CT)
CT is used to conﬁrm osteoid osteoma.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI can detect early metastatic lesions before X-ray
features are apparent.
It is also used to deﬁne the extent of malignant
bone tumours and can help to distinguish between
benign and malignant lesions.
Biopsy
It can be very difﬁcult to be certain of the diagnosis
in some cases. A biopsy will prove whether the
tumour is benign or malignant and exclude infection as the cause.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Recognize patterns of neurological pain from the history and examination.
• Give a differential diagnosis for neurological symptoms affecting the upper and lower
limbs.
• Know common investigations used to investigate neurological conditions.

Neurological symptoms occur when there is a nerve
lesion. Patients may complain of numbness, pins
and needles, electric shock type pain, burning,
hypersensitivity, pain, and weakness. The pattern of
these symptoms will help diagnose which nerve is
causing the problem.

Differential diagnosis
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Carpal tunnel syndrome.
Ulnar nerve entrapment.
Morton’s neuroma.
Tarsal tunnel syndrome.
Post surgery, e.g. superﬁcial radial nerve
neuroma.
Spinal pathology
—Disc prolapse
—Osteoarthritis
—Cervical rib
—Malignancy.
Nerve tumours, e.g. neuroﬁbroma,
schwannoma.
Medical causes, e.g. multiple sclerosis.
Peripheral neuropathy, e.g. alcoholism, diabetes
mellitus, drugs, vitamin B12 deﬁciency.
Complex regional pain syndrome.

History
The following points should be covered:

Site
Global or speciﬁc.
Very important in determining which nerve is
affected (see examination section).

Onset of symptoms
• Acute onset usually occurs with disc prolapse
where pain may be the main feature.
• Gradual onset where there is gradual increase in
nerve compression, e.g. spinal stenosis.
• May occur after trauma, e.g. carpal tunnel
syndrome after distal radius fracture.
• Accidental laceration to a nerve during surgery
can result in a painful neuroma and is most
common at the elbow (ulnar nerve) and wrist
(superﬁcial radial nerve).

Nature of symptoms
Exacerbating features
Sneezing and coughing often exacerbate symptoms
of leg pain with disc prolapse.
Relieving features
• Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome often get
night pain which is relieved by hanging their
hand down off the bed.
• Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis suffer pain,
and numbness in their legs after walking short
distances (spinal claudication) which is relieved
by sitting forward.
Associated features
• Loss of bowel or bladder function in patients
with back pain should be treated as cauda
equina syndrome until proven otherwise.
• Check for constitutional features such as weight
loss, malaise, or haemoptysis (lung cancer) if
malignancy is suspected. Pancoast’s tumour can
present with shoulder symptoms.

49

Altered sensation and weakness
• Patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus
may have weight loss, polyuria and polydipsia
associated with peripheral neuropathy.

Past medical history

peripheral nerve lesions know the sensory distribution and motor function. Some special tests may
reproduce nerve symptoms such as tapping a nerve
(Tinel’s test). Café au lait spots are characteristic of
neuroﬁbromatosis.

The following can predispose to nerve lesions:
• Pregnancy can predispose to carpal tunnel
syndrome (see page 181 for other predisposing
conditions).
• Malignancy.
• Previous surgery.
• Trauma.
• Osteo and rheumatoid arthritis.
• SLE.
Drug history
Some chemotherapy agents can cause peripheral
neuropathy.
Social history
Manual jobs may trigger ulnar or carpal tunnel
symptoms.
Alcohol.
Family history
Neuroﬁbromatosis (Von Recklinghausen’s disease).

Examination
Knowledge of myotomes and dermatomes will
help determine the level of a spinal cord lesion. For

50

Patients with severe carpal
tunnel syndrome will often be
having sleepless nights. They
look tired, unhappy and even
depressed. It is important not to underestimate the
effect this has and take this into consideration when
planning treatment. Simple splints may allow them a
good night’s sleep.

Investigation
Plain radiographs of the spine will show osteophytes
causing nerve root compression. MRI provides very
detailed soft tissue images and is commonly used to
investigate spinal pathology such as a disc prolapse.
Ultrasound can diagnose a Morton’s neuroma.
Nerve conductions studies are used routinely to
conﬁrm carpal tunnel syndrome and can be used to
diagnose other peripheral nerve lesions.

Deﬁne and classify osteoarthritis (OA).
List the causes of secondary OA.
Outline the pathological processes in the development of OA .
Describe the clinical features of OA.
Describe the X-ray features of OA.
Understand the basic conservative and surgical treatments for OA.

Deﬁnition
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a non-inﬂammatory disorder
of synovial joints characterized by articular surface
wear and formation of new bone (attempts at
repair). It is also known as degenerative joint disease
and characterized by joint pain, stiffness and swelling of joints.

Incidence
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease,
affecting up to 85% of the population at some time
in their lives. It is often asymptomatic and the true
prevalence of symptomatic OA in the western world
is around 20%.

Pathology and aetiology
Histologically the weight-bearing cartilage surface
degenerates and eventually wears away completely,
exposing the subchondral bone, which becomes
eburnated (Fig. 9.1). Cysts occur because of microfracture of the articular surface and new bone laid
down (sclerosis) in the surrounding bone. Disorganized new bone is produced at the margins of joints
(osteophytes) as the disease progresses. In addition
to this, the synovial lining becomes thickened and
inﬂamed, often producing excess synovial ﬂuid
(an effusion).

These changes explain the four cardinal
features seen on X-ray of joint space:
narrowing, sclerosis, cysts and osteophytes.

Osteoarthritis is described as primary where no
underlying cause is found or secondary where there
is a clear predisposing factor.
Primary osteoarthritis has many aetiological
factors but the exact cause is not known. A variety
of genetic and environmental factors are implicated
in causing osteoarthritis. This type of arthritis is
more common in women and increases with age.
In secondary osteoarthritis a cause is clearly identiﬁed and these are shown in Figure 9.2.

Clinical features
The presenting complaints of patients with osteoarthritis are variable. The patient is usually systemically well and complains of pain which is usually
aching or burning in nature and localized to the
joint but may be referred to the joint below.
The history is often of gradually increasing, asymmetrical joint pain over several years, the level of
which is variable but can be severe. The pain is

worse after activity and relieved by rest, and as
the disease progresses night pain can be a feature.
Occasionally patients present with rapidly destructive OA, which can mimic a septic or inﬂammatory
arthritis.

Classically pain in the hip can be referred
to the knee.

54

Patients can present with only one or multiple
joint involvement.
Other symptoms include swelling, deformity
(bow legs—varus knee), stiffness and weakness
(usually secondary to wasting). Patients will also
complain they are unable to do certain activities,
which may be recreational or more basic activities
of daily living (for example, patients with severe
osteoarthritis of the hip are unable to put on socks
or cut their own toenails).
Almost any synovial joint can be affected by
osteoarthritis, most commonly the knee, hip, hands
(often the ﬁrst carpometacarpal joint), ﬁngers (distal
interphalangeal (DIP) joints) but also the spine,
shoulder, elbow and wrist (Figs 9.3 and 9.4).
The examination begins as the patient enters the
room.
• Look for a limp, use of a stick and how reliant
the patient is on relatives for simple tasks such
as undressing for examination.
• Deformity may be obvious but also note
previous scars, redness, swelling and wasting of
muscles on inspection.
• Palpate for an effusion, joint line tenderness
and crepitus (cracking noise can be heard in
severe cases).
• The range of movement of the particular joint
will be diminished and there may be ﬁxed
deformity.
• The joints above and below should be
examined.

In many cases the diagnosis is clear from the history
and clinical examination, and apart from a plain Xray further investigation may be unnecessary.
Blood tests may be required to exclude septic or
inﬂammatory arthritis in atypical cases if the treating doctor is not certain of the diagnosis.
X-rays will usually show decreased joint space,
sclerosis, subchondral cysts and osteophytes
(Fig. 9.5).

Management
There is no cure for osteoarthritis and treatment is
aimed at relieving pain and maintaining function.
The treatment for osteoarthritis can be conservative
or surgical.

Fig. 9.3 Joints commonly affected by osteoarthritis.

A detailed social history is
very important in patients
who have osteoarthritis. Ask
about occupation, activities of
daily living and hobbies. What is their normal
mobility? These type of questions help to assess
patients’ quality of life and how their condition
affects them.

and practice of medicine, 19th edn. Churchill Livingstone,

Classic features of osteoarthritis include
Herberden’s nodes of the DIP joint and a
Baker’s cyst behind the knee.

• Initially lifestyle advice including weight loss,
regular exercise and avoidance of impact
loading activities is given. Non-steroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs such as diclofenac are
good in the early stages providing the patient
does not have a history of peptic ulceration.
Other regular analgesia such as codeine and
paracetamol should be prescribed if required.
• Physiotherapy improves gait and function of an
affected limb, and simple measures such as a
walking stick reduce pain on walking.
• Glucosamine is widely taken by the population
at large but the small beneﬁcial effect shown in
some studies is probably a placebo effect.
• Injections of corticosteroids are useful for
temporary relief, especially in patients unﬁt for
surgery; however, there is a small risk of
infection. New treatments such as hyaluronic

acid derivatives given by injection are expensive
and not yet proven.

Surgical
Surgical treatments for osteoarthritis depend on the
age of the patient, the joint involved and the level
of pain and disability experienced. This is dealt with
in more detail in Chapter 20.
The decision to operate can be difﬁcult to make,
as all surgery has risks and complications. Surgery
may help when the patient says, ‘I cannot cope any
longer with the pain.’

Osteoarthritis

Arthroplasty surgery is not risk
free and patients should be
told that although the pain
should improve, the joint will
never function like a normal joint. Surgery can also
have serious complications including infection and
thromboembolism which in a small percentage of
patients may be fatal. This must be explained during
the consent process.

There are ﬁve things a surgeon can do to a
joint:
1. Debride and washout. This is usually done for
osteoarthritis of the knee and gives temporary
relief in some patients although there is little
evidence to support this.
2. Joint replacement (arthroplasty). This is most
commonly of the hip or knee. It gives excellent
pain relief in 90% of patients for at least 10
years.
3. Joint fusion. The two sides are removed and
fused together. This is most commonly used

around the foot and ankle; good pain relief is
achieved provided fusion occurs but obviously
movement is lost.
4. Joint excision. This is less commonly used
nowadays. It is still used occasionally in the
ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and
where other methods have failed (e.g. hip—
Girdlestone’s procedure).
5. Realignment surgery. Increased load passing
through a joint because of a deformity often
leads to osteoarthritis. The surgeon can realign
the limb by breaking the bone above or below
the joint, removing a wedge of bone and
correcting the deformity. The most common
site for this procedure is the knee. The patient
will usually have a varus deformity of the knee
(bow legs). The tibia is realigned to redistribute
the load more evenly, slowing the progression
of osteoarthritis. See Figure 9.6.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the role that cytokines play in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA).
• Describe the usual distribution of joint inﬂammation in RA.
• Recognize the common hand deformities caused by RA.
• Understand that RA causes systemic symptoms in addition to joint pain.
• List the causes of anaemia in RA.
• Describe the four main radiological signs of RA.
• Recognize the importance of the multidisciplinary team in the care of patients
with RA.
• Name some disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs used in the treatment of RA.

Deﬁnition
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common inﬂammatory condition. It is characterized by polyarticular
arthritis and follows a chronic course, resulting
in signiﬁcant disability. RA is a multi-system
disease and is associated with a reduction in life
expectancy.

RA has a major impact on patients’ lives.
After 20 years, 80% of patients are
disabled. Life expectancy is reduced by
between 3 and 18 years.

and environmental factors having an important
inﬂuence.

Genetic factors
Genetic factors contribute approximately 50% to the
aetiology. The inheritance of certain human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes increases RA susceptibility
and severity. HLA-DR4 is particularly important.

Environmental factors
Environmental inﬂuences on the development of
RA are not well understood. People have examined
the effects of various infections, occupations and
lifestyle factors, but no links have been found.

Incidence and prevalence

Immunological abnormalities

RA affects females more commonly than males.
Most studies show a female-to-male excess of
between two and four times. The annual incidence
in the UK is 0.1–0.2/1000 in males and 0.2–0.4/1000
in females. RA prevalence in Europeans and North
American Caucasians is close to 1%.

In rheumatoid arthritis, the immunological mechanisms that usually protect the body by ﬁghting infections and destroying malignant cells target normal
tissue, resulting in joint damage. T-lymphocytes
play a key role in the initiation of inﬂammation in
RA (Figs 10.1–10.3).
The activated cells produce cytokines (intercellular messenger proteins), e.g. tumour necrosis factorα (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1). These cytokines
have many actions, including those shown in Figure
10.4.

Aetiology
The aetiology of RA has not been explained. It
appears to be multifactorial, with both genetic

Rheumatoid factor is found in the serum of
approximately 80% of patients with RA. High levels
are associated with more severe disease and the presence of extra-articular features.

Pathology
The main pathological abnormality in RA is synovitis. As inﬂammatory cells inﬁltrate the synovium, it

60

proliferates. Chronically inﬂamed tissue (pannus)
extends from the joint margins, and erodes the
articular cartilage (Fig. 10.5). Extensive erosion of
cartilage and bone, with concomitant involvement of ligaments and joint capsules, leads to joint
deformity.
Subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules are found in
up to 20% of patients. They usually accompany
severe disease and are possibly due to small vessel

vasculitis. Histology reveals a central area of ﬁbrinoid necrosis surrounded by ﬁbroblasts.

Clinical features
RA can develop at any time of life from infancy to
old age. The peak age of onset is in the fourth and
ﬁfth decades. Symptoms usually begin gradually,
developing over weeks or months. However, some
people experience an acute onset.
The clinical features of RA can be divided into:

Fig. 10.6 The joints most commonly affected by RA.

• Articular features.
• Extra-articular features:
—Systemic
—Periarticular
—Affecting distant organs.

Articular features of RA
The usual presenting symptoms of rheumatoid
arthritis are joint pain, stiffness and swelling. Stiffness is usually noticed on waking in the morning
and tends to improve as the day progresses. The
duration of this early-morning stiffness is a useful
marker of disease activity. RA predominantly targets
small and medium joints in a symmetrical fashion
(Fig 10.6), but sometimes other patterns of joint
involvement are seen.
Monoarthritis
Occasionally, a patient presents with a monoarthritis of a larger joint such as the knee or shoulder.

Palindromic rheumatism
Synovitis appears to move rapidly from one region
to another. Inﬂammation of one or more joints
begins acutely, lasts for hours or days and then
settles quickly. Patients experience recurrent attacks
and many go on to develop typical RA.
Pain and stiffness lead to varying degrees of functional loss. Even in the early stages of the disease,
patients can struggle with everyday tasks such as
dressing and turning on taps because of active synovitis. In established RA, joint destruction results in
further limitations.

61

Rheumatoid arthritis

Ulnar deviation
Fig. 10.7 The hands of a patient with RA. Note the synovitis
of the wrists, metacarpophalangeal and proximal
interphalangeal joints.

Patients usually feel extremely
frustrated by their loss of
function. It is important that
doctors listen sympathetically
to their concerns and help them to ﬁnd solutions.
For example, the secretary who struggles to type
because of her wrist pain may beneﬁt from input
from an occupational therapist and some wrist
splints.

Fig. 10.8 Ulnar deviation.

Boutonnière

Swan-neck

Fig. 10.9 Boutonnière and swan-neck deformities.

Synovitis causes ‘boggy’ joint swelling. The skin
overlying an affected joint is usually warm and red
due to increased local blood ﬂow. On palpation, the
swelling is tender and has a similar consistency to
that of a grape.
The effects of RA on speciﬁc joint regions
The rheumatoid hand and wrist The hands and
wrists are almost always involved in RA (Fig. 10.7).
Synovitis typically occurs in the wrists, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal
(PIP) joints, sparing the distal interphalangeal
(DIP) joints. This inﬂammation can weaken the
ligaments and tendons, producing well-recognized
deformities.
Ulnar deviation of the ﬁngers results from
metacarpophalangeal joint synovitis (Fig. 10.8).
Subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joints can
occur, with the proximal phalanges drifting in an
ulnar and volar direction.

62

Boutonnière and swan-neck deformities of the
digits are due to proximal interphalangeal joint
synovitis and laxity and/or contractures of the
extensor and ﬂexor apparatus (Fig. 10.9). The boutonnière deformity is characterized by PIP ﬂexion
and DIP hyperextension. With swan-neck deformity
there is MCP ﬂexion, PIP hyperextension and DIP
ﬂexion.
Radial deviation of the wrist occurs to compensate partly for ulnar deviation of the ﬁngers. Subluxation of the wrist results in prominence of the ulnar
styloid.
The foot Forefoot synovitis and damage are common in rheumatoid arthritis. The proximal phalanges sublux dorsally and the metatarsal heads become
eroded and displaced towards the ﬂoor. They can be
easily palpated through the sole of the foot and

often experience other musculoskeletal problems.

make weight-bearing very uncomfortable. Patients
often feel as though they are ‘walking on marbles’.
Hindfoot involvement can also cause problems,
with subtalar arthritis. Patients with established
disease develop valgus deformities here.
The cervical spine Inﬂammation and erosive disease, affecting the uncovertebral joints and stabilizing ligaments of the ﬁrst two cervical vertebrae, can
result in atlantoaxial subluxation. The atlas slips
forward on the axis, reducing the space around the
spinal cord (Fig. 10.10). This produces neck pain
that radiates to the occiput. Upper motor neuron
damage resulting in a spastic quadriparesis is a rare
complication.
Damage to the articulation between the occiput
and atlas may allow the odontoid peg to move
upwards, through the foramen magnum. This can
threaten the cervical cord and brainstem, sometimes
resulting in sudden death after minor jolts to the
head and neck.

It is important to take lateral ﬂexion Xrays of the cervical spine in RA patients
requiring a general anaesthetic. The
anaesthetist must be aware of any cervical instability
so that precautions can be taken during intubation.

Rheumatoid nodules Rheumatoid nodules are ﬁrm
subcutaneous swellings that tend to develop in areas
affected by pressure or friction, such as the ﬁngers,
elbows and Achilles tendon. They are seen in patients
who test positive for rheumatoid factor. Nodulosis
at any site can be complicated by infection.
Tenosynovitis and bursitis Tendon sheaths and
bursae are lined with synovium. This can become
inﬂamed in RA, resulting in tenosynovitis and bursitis. The ﬂexor tendons of the ﬁngers are often
affected by tenosynovitis. The olecranon and subacromial bursae are common sites of bursitis.
Carpal tunnel syndrome Synovitis can cause entrapment of peripheral nerves. Median nerve compression resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome is
common.
Systemic features of RA
As well as causing joint pain and swelling, active RA
makes people feel generally unwell. The inﬂammation can result in systemic symptoms such as fever,
weight loss and lethargy. These can be prominent,
particularly in people with acute-onset RA, in whom
infection and malignancy are important differential
diagnoses.

When patients with RA ﬁrst
present, they have often felt
fatigued for several months.
They ﬁnd it reassuring to hear
that that systemic symptoms are common and
usually improve when the joint inﬂammation is
treated.

The effects of RA on distant organs
RA can affect many body systems (Fig. 10.11). Extraarticular disease can be serious and is associated
with an increase in mortality.
Anaemia Anaemia of RA can be due to:
• Anaemia of chronic disease.
• Autoimmune haemolysis.
• Felty’s syndrome.

Drugs used in the treatment of RA can also induce
anaemia. Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
can cause iron deﬁciency as a result of chronic blood
loss from gastrointestinal inﬂammation. Diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs sometimes produce
anaemia via bone marrow suppression.
Felty’s syndrome Felty’s syndrome is the association of RA with splenomegaly and leucopenia. It
usually occurs in patients who are rheumatoid factor
positive. The leucopenia leads to frequent bacterial
infections. Lymphadenopathy, anaemia and thrombocytopenia can also occur.
Rheumatoid lung disease Although pulmonary
disease is common in RA, it does not always produce
symptoms. Males are more frequently affected than
females.
Pleural effusions can occur early in the disease,
sometimes preceding the arthritis. Rheumatoid
factor can be detected in the ﬂuid, which is a transudate. Lung nodules are found in patients who are
seropositive and usually have subcutaneous nodules.

64

They rarely cause symptoms, but can cavitate or
become infected. Pneumonitis can lead to pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
Cardiac disease Pericardial inﬂammation is common in RA, but rarely symptomatic. Pericardial effusions can occur. Myocarditis is a rare manifestation
of RA. Coronary arteritis is also rare and usually
occurs as part of a generalized vasculitis.
Eye disease Keratoconjunctivitis sicca affects at
least 10% of patients with RA. Eyes are dry because
of reduced tear production and the cornea and
conjunctiva can become damaged. Episcleritis and
scleritis are less common. Both cause redness
and often pain of the eye. Severe scleritis can rarely
result in spontaneous scleral perforation, so needs
treating aggressively.
Amyloidosis Secondary amyloidosis develops as a
result of chronic inﬂammation. Many organs can be
inﬁltrated, including the kidneys, heart, liver and
gastrointestinal tract. Proteinuria due to renal disease

Rheumatoid arthritis
is the commonest manifestation of amyloidosis in
RA. Prognosis is poor.
Vasculitis Vasculitis occasionally complicates RA.
It predominates in patients who are seropositive for
rheumatoid factor and have severe disease. Common
clinical features include leg ulcers and peripheral
neuropathy. Rarely, there is involvement of coronary or cerebral vessels which leads to cardiac or
cerebral ischaemia.

Investigations

10

Radiological investigations
Plain X-rays should be obtained to look for signs of
RA (Fig. 10.12). These tend to be seen ﬁrst in the
small joints of the hands and feet (Figs 10.13 and
10.14).
Radiological changes are often not apparent
when patients ﬁrst present with RA. In patients with
normal X-rays, but persistent symptoms, it is useful

The four main radiological signs of RA

The following investigations are useful:

Blood tests
Full blood count may show anaemia of chronic
disease, thrombocytosis secondary to inﬂammation
or leucopenia of Felty’s syndrome.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein
and plasma viscosity are usually raised in the presence of synovitis and they are useful markers of
response to treatment.
Rheumatoid factor is found in the serum of
70–90% of RA patients, but is often not detectable
during the ﬁrst few months of the disease. Those
patients who lack the antibodies are sometimes
described as having ‘seronegative rheumatoid arthritis’. It is important to remember that rheumatoid
factor is also found in at least 1% of the normal
population. Patients with positive rheumatoid factor
are more likely to have systemic involvement and
have a worse prognosis.
Another serological test is now available to help
with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-CCP
(cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies can be
present in patients who are rheumatoid factor negative and are felt to indicate a worse prognosis. They
are not associated with systemic features.

Patients with joint pain are often told
that they have RA on the basis of a
positive rheumatoid factor alone.
Rheumatoid factor can be present in ‘healthy’
people. The diagnosis of RA should only be made
after interpreting the ﬁndings of a detailed clinical
history and examination, and the results of all
investigations.

to repeat the X-rays after several months. Erosions
can be detected sooner using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging.
The tests discussed above are always useful in the
investigation of patients with possible RA. However,
different clinical presentations often require additional investigations.

Management
Patients with RA should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. Figure 20.8 (p. 147) lists the operations commonly performed on patients with RA.
Figure 10.15 lists the professionals involved in the
care of RA patients and gives details of the roles they
play.

Drug treatment
There are two main aims of drug treatment in RA:
• Reduction of symptoms.
• Prevention of damage by control of disease.
Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
NSAIDs can improve joint pain and stiffness, but
have no effect on disease activity or progression. If
a patient does not respond to one NSAID, it is worth
trying another.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids can swiftly improve pain and swelling in RA. Low doses of oral prednisolone are often
used to control symptoms early in the disease before
DMARDs (see below) become effective. Corticosteroids can be given intra-articularly to treat local
synovitis and are sometimes given via the intramuscular or intravenous route for a generalized ﬂare of
rheumatoid arthritis.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs)
DMARDs are capable of suppressing disease activity
and may slow progression of erosive joint damage.
Some DMARDs suppress the immune system; others
inhibit cell replication. However, for many of these
drugs, the mechanism of action is not completely
understood.

ing DMARD therapy. The monitoring protocol
depends on the drug prescribed. For example, a
patient taking methotrexate should have a full blood
count and tests of liver and renal function performed
at intervals of 4–8 weeks.
Biological therapies
Biological therapies that target inﬂammatory mediators in RA are now widely used. Three agents that
are currently available inhibit TNF-α. Etanercept is
a soluble TNF-α receptor, and inﬂiximab and adalimumab are monoclonal antibodies against TNF-α.
These drugs produce good clinical results but are
expensive and carry an increased risk of infection.
The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)
have issued strict guidelines for the use of these
drugs in the UK. Disease activity scoring systems are
employed to demonstrate that the biological drugs
are producing good clinical responses. There is some
evidence to suggest that patients who do not respond
to one anti-TNF agent may respond if they are
switched to another.
Drugs that manipulate other cytokines are in
various stages of development. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against B cells which is used in the
treatment of RA when anti-TNF therapy
has failed. Abatacept is a T cell co-stimulation
modulator.

Further reading
DMARDs are slow-acting and take several weeks
to produce a clinical effect. If a patient does not
respond adequately to one DMARD, a second can
be added or substituted.
Like many drugs, DMARDs can cause minor sideeffects, including nausea, headache and rashes
(Fig. 10.16). More serious complications such as
bone marrow suppression, abnormal liver function
and renal impairment are rarer, but well recognized.
It is therefore important to monitor patients receiv-

Spondyloarthropathies

11

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Recognize the skeletal features of the spondyloarthropathies.
• Understand how to differentiate between mechanical and inﬂammatory back pain on
history.
• List the extraskeletal features of ankylosing spondylitis.
• Recognize the different patterns of joint involvement in psoriatic arthritis.
• Understand the differences between reactive arthritis and septic arthritis.

Deﬁnition
The term ‘spondyloarthropathy’ (SPA) (or ‘spondyloarthritis’) describes a group of related and often
overlapping inﬂammatory joint disorders (Fig.
11.1). The SPAs are characterized by enthesitis as
well as synovitis, and occur in patients who are
seronegative for rheumatoid factor. For this reason,
they are sometimes referred to as ‘seronegative spondyloarthropathies’. An enthesis is the insertion of a
tendon, ligament or capsule into bone.

Aetiology
All types of SPA are genetically associated with HLAB27, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class 1 antigen. HLA-B27 is more closely linked
with some SPAs than others. It is most prevalent in
ankylosing spondylitis, affecting 85–95% of these
patients. The antigen is carried by approximately
10% of healthy Caucasians.
The true aetiology of the SPAs is unknown. Infection is thought to be important. Bacterial DNA and
proteins have been detected in joints affected by
reactive arthritis (see below) and it is thought that
infection may play a role in the development of
other SPAs. It is possible that bacteria trigger an
immune reaction in genetically predisposed people.
There is an association with inﬂammatory bowel
disease, which may be explained by an increase in
the permeability of the gut to pathogens.

Pathology
The entheses are the key sites of inﬂammation
in SPA. Initial inﬂammation and erosions are

followed by ﬁbrosis and ossiﬁcation, which can
result in ankylosis of joints. In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the outer ﬁbres of the vertebral
discs become inﬂamed where they attach to the
corners of the vertebral bodies. Erosions cause
squaring of the vertebrae, and ossiﬁcation leads
to formation of syndesmophytes (bony bridges).
The sacroiliac joints are commonly affected
and often become fused. Synovitis is another
feature of the SPAs. Peripheral joints tend to be
more commonly involved in psoriatic and reactive arthritis than in enteropathic arthritis and
AS.
Pathological changes are not always conﬁned to
the musculoskeletal system. Cardiac and pulmonary
abnormalities can occur.

ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

Clinical features
The prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
amongst Caucasians is 0.5–1%. It is three times
more common in men than in women and tends to
be more severe in men. It usually develops in early
adulthood, with the peak age of onset being in the
mid-20s. Presentation after the age of 45 years is
rare.
Clinical features can be divided into two
groups:
• Musculoskeletal.
• Extraskeletal.

69

Spondyloarthropathies

Musculoskeletal features
Most symptoms in AS are due to spinal and sacroiliac disease. The typical patient presents with a
gradual onset of lower back pain and stiffness.
Symptoms are worse early in the morning and after
long periods of rest. They usually improve with exercise. Involvement of the thoracic spine and enthesitis at the costochondral junctions may cause chest
pain. Disease of the costovertebral joints can reduce
chest expansion and restrict breathing.

Lower back pain is common
and usually due to mechanical
or degenerative problems. It is
important to consider the
possibility of spinal inﬂammation, particularly when
assessing young patients with troublesome back
pain. Always ask about the presence of morning
stiffness.

In the early stages of the disease, patients may
have few clinical signs. The sacroiliac joints are often
tender and pain can be reproduced by applying
physical stress to the joints. This can be achieved by

applying pressure on the anterior superior iliac
spines whilst the patient is lying supine.
Mobility of the lumbar spine is reduced. The
Schober test is used to assess forward ﬂexion in this
region of the spine (see Fig. 11.2). With a pen, a
mark is made on the skin at the lumbosacral joint,
level with the dimples of Venus. A second mark is
made 10 cm above. The patient bends forward with
the legs straight and attempts to touch the ﬂoor. The
distance between the two marks should increase by
at least 5 cm.

Some patients with AS have an
abnormal Schober test, but are able to
touch their toes because of good hip
ﬂexion.

Most patients with AS experience exacerbations
and remissions. In those with severe disease, the
spine becomes progressively stiffer and posture
deteriorates (Fig. 11.3). The normal lumbar lordosis
is lost and the thoracic and cervical spines become
increasingly kyphotic. The resulting stooped posture
further restricts chest expansion and causes the
abdomen to protrude. It is sometimes referred to
as the ‘question-mark posture’. Spinal disease can
be complicated by atlantoaxial subluxation and
fractures.
The peripheral joints are involved less commonly
than the axial skeleton in AS. Inﬂammation tends
to target medium/large joints such as the shoulders,
hips or knees. Pain and tenderness due to enthesitis

can occur at many sites. Achilles tendonitis and
plantar fasciitis are common examples of this.

Investigations

Extraskeletal features
Systemic
Systemic features such as anorexia, fever, weight loss
and fatigue trouble some patients, particularly early
in the disease.
Extraskeletal features can be thought of as the
four As.
Acute anterior uveitis Acute anterior uveitis (also
called iritis) occurs in approximately one-third of
patients with AS and does not correlate with the
disease activity in the spine. The eye becomes red
and painful and vision is blurred. It can be treated
with steroid eye drops.

Patients suffering from any
spondyloarthropathy should
be warned of the risk of
uveitis and told to seek
medical help if they develop a painful, red eye.

Aortic incompetence/Ascending aortitis This occurs
less frequently and usually late in the disease.

Amyloidosis This is a rare complication.

Blood tests
• A full blood count may reveal an anaemia of
chronic disease.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Creactive protein (CRP) are often raised during
active phases of the disease.
• Serological tests for rheumatoid factor are
negative.
• Genotyping for HLA-B27 is expensive and
unnecessary for diagnosis, which can be made
on clinical and radiological ﬁndings.

Radiological investigations
X-rays are useful in the diagnosis of AS. An anteroposterior view of the pelvis will show the sacroiliac joints. These appear normal initially, but later
sclerosis and erosions are seen, sometimes progressing to complete fusion (Fig. 11.4). Views of
the lumbar spine may show squaring of the vertebrae and formation of syndesmophytes (Fig
11.5). These are due to ossiﬁcation of the longitudinal ligaments and produce a bamboo appearance. Radiographs taken at other sites of enthesitis
may show erosions, for example at the insertion
of the plantar fascia or Achilles tendon. MRI scans
of the sacroiliac joints and spine enable inﬂammation to be seen at an earlier stage and may
help in deciding which patients will beneﬁt from
aggressive treatment.

sis factor) drugs are now being used for severe AS
and seem quite promising.

Surgery
There are several indications for surgical intervention in AS. Joint replacement surgery is often performed in patients with hip involvement. Spinal
osteotomy can help improve posture when severe
spinal curvature interferes with forward vision. Cervical fusion is sometimes required for atlantoaxial
subluxation.

REACTIVE ARTHRITIS
Reactive arthritis is an aseptic arthritis that develops
after an anatomically distant infection. It mainly
affects young adults and the triggering infection
is usually of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary
tract.

Fig. 11.5 Lateral radiograph showing syndesmophyte
formation in the lumbar spine of a patient with advanced
AS.

Remember that Salmonella and
Neisseria can cause a true septic arthritis,
so it is important to exclude this.

Management
Patients with AS should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team (see Fig. 10.15).

Physiotherapy
This is the most important element in the management of AS. Each patient should follow a long-term
exercise programme with the aim of maintaining
normal posture and physical activity. Hydrotherapy
is also beneﬁcial.

Drug treatment
Drug treatment can help to minimize pain and
stiffness. Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) can be effective (probably should not
recommend regular use in view of cardiovascular
side-effects). Indometacin is a particularly popular
choice. Many disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs) have been tested in AS. There is
little evidence to support their use, but sulfasalazine
is sometimes used in an attempt to gain control of
peripheral joint synovitis. Anti-TNF (tumour necro-

Clinical features
Symptoms start a few days to a few weeks after the
infection. The onset is sometimes acute with high
fever and fatigue.

Musculoskeletal features of
reactive arthritis
The arthritis is typically asymmetrical and oligoarticular. It tends to target the large weight-bearing
joints, ﬁngers and toes. Dactylitis is often seen. This
is involvement of an entire ﬁnger or toe, creating
what is often called a ‘sausage digit’ . Enthesitis is
common and some patients experience pain in the
sacroiliac region.

Extraskeletal features of reactive arthritis
Patients with reactive arthritis can develop the
uveitis and cardiac problems seen in AS, as well as
other extra-articular features.

Enteropathic arthritis
Conjunctivitis
This is sterile and can be unilateral or bilateral.

11

Neisseria may help identify the organism
responsible for the infection.

Urethritis
Sterile inﬂammation in the urogenital tract can
cause symptoms of frequency, dysuria and sometimes urethral discharge. Cervicitis or prostatitis can
occur.

• Synovial ﬂuid from any affected joints should
be examined and a Gram stain and culture
performed. Cultures are negative in reactive
arthritis, but it is important to exclude septic
arthritis.

Skin and mucosal lesions
Circinate balanitis can accompany urethritis. Some
patients with reactive arthritis develop a sterile pustular rash on the palms of the hands and soles of
the feet. This looks similar to pustular psoriasis and
is called keratoderma blenorrhagica. Erythema
nodosum is another recognized association.

• A cervical swab, midstream specimen of urine
and stool sample should be obtained for
bacterial culture.

Reiter’s syndrome
The term ‘Reiter’s syndrome’ is used to describe the
triad of arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis in a
patient with dysentery.

You must enquire about the
presence of genitourinary
symptoms and any history of
sexually transmitted infections
in patients presenting with asymmetrical
oligoarticular inﬂammatory arthritis. Patients may
feel embarassed or threatened by this. It is helpful
to start by explaining that joint inﬂammation can be
triggered by genitourinary infections and that you
routinely ask patients these questions.

Clinical course of reactive arthritis
The symptoms of reactive arthritis vary in severity
and usually last for weeks to months. Relapses are
common and often occur several years later. At least
60% of patients have two or more attacks. Permanent joint damage can occur, but is rare.

Investigations

• X-rays are initially normal. Later, ﬂuffy
periostitis may be seen in the calcaneus, digits
or pelvis. Plantar spurs are common, but
erosions are rare. Sacroiliitis and typical AS
changes develop in some patients.

Management of reactive arthritis
As in AS, NSAIDs can help. Local corticosteroid
injection can help enthesitis or synovitis. Sulfasalazine, azathioprine or methotrexate may be useful for
persistent, severe disease.

Septic arthritis must be excluded before
using corticosteroids.

Antibiotic therapy should be given if an organism
is isolated. This probably has little inﬂuence on the
disease course, but will help stop the spread of
infection.

ENTEROPATHIC ARTHRITIS
Arthritis occurring in association with inﬂammatory
bowel disease (IBD) is known as enteropathic arthritis. It occurs in approximately 10–20% of patients
with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.

• Full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) show a
similar picture to that of AS.

Clinical features

when the severity of the bowel disease increases and

PSORIATIC ARTHROPATHY

Enthesopathy

Psoriatic arthropathy (PsA) is an inﬂammatory
arthritis associated with psoriasis. Psoriasis occurs in
1–3% of the population, and approximately 10% of
those affected develop psoriatic arthritis. It is particularly common in patients with nail involvement
(Fig. 11.6) and affects men and women with a
similar frequency.

This can accompany axial or peripheral joint
disease.

Clinical features

Spondylitis and sacroiliitis
These are not related to the activity of the bowel
inﬂammation and often predate the onset of Crohn’s
disease or ulcerative colitis.

Investigations
X-rays show typical spinal changes of AS. The peripheral arthritis causes few radiological changes.

Management
Treatment of the IBD is the main priority and will
help the arthritis. Drugs, such as corticosteroids and
sulfasalazine should improve both the bowel and
joint disease.

NSAIDs often aggravate gastrointestinal
symptoms in IBD. They should be used
with caution and replaced with other
forms of analgesia if poorly tolerated.

Fig. 11.6 Psoriatic nail pitting.

74

Psoriatic arthritis may precede the diagnosis of psoriasis and does not correlate with the severity of the
skin lesions. Five different patterns of joint disease
are seen (Fig. 11.7).
Patients present with joint pain, stiffness and
sometimes swelling. Dactylitis and enthesitis are
common features. Involvement of a distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint is usually associated with pitting
or onycholysis of the nail. Arthritis mutilans is
extremely destructive and, fortunately, uncommon.
Reabsorption of bone at the metacarpals and phalanges causes telescoping of the digits. They appear
shortened but can be passively extended to their
original length. Psoriatic spondylitis tends to cause
milder symptoms than classical AS, and sacroiliitis
is often asymmetrical and asymptomatic. The
uveitis and cardiac lesions seen in other SPAs can
occur.

Investigations
Blood tests
Full blood count, ESR and CRP show a similar
picture to that of AS. Rheumatoid factor is usually
absent.

Radiological investigations
The radiological changes of PsA are asymmetrical
and target the small joints of the hands and feet,
particularly the DIP joints (Fig. 11.8). X-ray changes
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Erosions with proliferation of adjacent bone.
Reabsorption of the terminal phalanges.
Pencil-in-cup deformities.
Periostitis.
Ankylosis.
New bone formation at entheses.

Peripheral joint arthritis and spinal disease in PsA
are treated in the same way as in RA and AS
respectively. Physiotherapy, NSAIDs and DMARD
therapy are all commonly used. Anti-TNF treatment is now widely used and has shown promising results.

Prognosis
The prognosis of PsA is usually good. Joint function is well preserved in most cases, but in some,
a chronic, progressive, deforming arthritis may
develop.

Objectives
In this chapter you will learn:

•

To recognize the clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Which autoantibodies are associated with SLE.
How to regognize, investigate and treat inﬂammatory muscle disease.
The differences between limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis.
The wide variety of ways in which patients with systemic vasculitis can present.

There is no strict deﬁnition of a connective tissue
disease. The term is usually used to describe multisystem, inﬂammatory diseases that are associated
with immunological abnormalities. There is overlap
between these disorders, which share many clinical
features (Fig. 12.1).

SYSTEMIC LUPUS
ERYTHEMATOSUS

Deﬁnition
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an inﬂammatory disease that can involve almost any organ or
system of the body.

Prevalence
SLE has a worldwide prevalence of 10–50 per
100 000. It affects women at least 10 times more
frequently than it affects men, and is more common
in Asian and Afro-Caribbean people than in
Caucasians.

Aetiology
There are genetic, environmental and hormonal
contributions to its aetiology. SLE can be induced
by drugs, such as minocycline or hydralazine. Druginduced lupus tends to be mild, spares the kidneys
and settles when the offending drug is withdrawn.

Pathology
Immune function in SLE is abnormal, with abnormal cell-mediated immunity, B-cell hyperactivity

and impaired immune complex clearance from
tissues. A wide variety of autoantibodies have been
described. The coagulation system may be abnormal
and vasculopathy is frequent.

Clinical features
SLE usually develops between 15 and 40 years of
age. The clinical features are diverse and the severity
of the disease varies over time. Initial symptoms
may be mild and rather vague, but it is the exacerbations of SLE and resultant tissue damage that cause
signiﬁcant ill-health. Severe lupus ﬂares can result
in life-threatening problems, including renal failure
or cerebral vasculitis. Factors that may trigger ﬂares
of SLE are listed in Figure 12.2.

Non-speciﬁc features
Fatigue, malaise, fever and weight loss are common
in SLE. The fatigue can be quite disabling and is
difﬁcult to treat.

Hypothyroidism is more common in SLE
than in the general population and
should be considered in patients with
severe lethargy.

Musculoskeletal features
Approximately 90% of patients with SLE experience
arthralgia or arthritis, usually polyarticular. The
arthritis is not erosive and the symptoms are usually

more dramatic than the signs. If deformity occurs,
it is due to tenosynovitis and ﬁbrosis, rather than
cartilage or bone erosion. Jaccoud’s arthropathy is
the name given to this deformity in the hands, as it
resembles the deformity of rheumatic fever.
Myalgia is a common symptom of SLE. Avascular
necrosis of bone can occur, as can osteoporosis, but
they are usually a consequence of corticosteroid
treatment, rather than of the disease itself. Septic
arthritis is a rare, serious, outcome.

SLE can present with urticarial lesions, livedo reticularis, palpable purpura and splinter haemorrhages.

Cardiovascular features
Dermatological features
There are many cutaneous manifestations of lupus.
Photosensitivity is common (c. 60%) The characteristic ‘butterﬂy’ rash develops over the nose and
cheeks (Fig. 12.3). Discoid lupus (demarcated, pigmented or atrophic plaques) can develop with no
systemic features (Fig. 12.4).
Hair loss reﬂects disease activity and alopecia
may develop. Mucosal ulceration may affect the

78

Serositis is common in SLE and pericarditis is the
commonest cardiac manifestation. Myocarditis may
accompany myositis and can present with arrhythmias or cardiac failure. Libman–Sacks endocarditis
is due to non-infective vegetations and seldom
causes clinical problems.
At least one-third of patients with SLE suffer
from Raynaud’s phenomenon. Vasospasm, usually
provoked by the cold, causes peripheral ischaemia.

Systemic lupus erythematosus
This can be seen in the digits, tip of the nose and
ear lobes, which become pale and numb, before
turning blue. The ﬁnal phase is of redness and
ﬂushing due to eventual vasodilatation. Vasculitis
presents with skin rashes or ulcers and can rarely
affect internal organs, such as the lungs and
brain.

Pulmonary features
Amongst the pulmonary features of lupus, pleurisy
and pleural effusions are common. Acute pneumonitis can mimic pneumonia. Chronic pneumonitis
causes pulmonary ﬁbrosis. Pulmonary hypertension
is rare.

Renal features
Glomerulonephritis is the commonest cause of
lupus-related death in patients with SLE. Nephritis
does not cause clinical symptoms until there is signiﬁcant renal damage. It is therefore important to
monitor patients’ blood pressure and check their
urine for protein, red cells and casts, so that renal
disease can be detected early.

12

It is important to consider SLE
as a possible cause of
arthralgia, particularly in
young women. Always ask
about the presence of symptoms such as skin
rashes, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, headaches,
depression, Raynaud’s phenomenon and pleurisy.

Overlap with other diseases
It is common for patients with SLE to develop secondary Sjögren’s syndrome or the antiphospholipid
antibody syndrome (see below).

Investigations
Serological tests
SLE is characterized by the presence of serum
autoantibodies against nuclear components (see
Fig. 12.5).

Neurological features

Other tests

SLE can involve the central nervous system, cranial
and peripheral nerves, producing a wide range of
clinical features. These include headaches, psychiatric problems, seizures, neuropathies and chorea.
Headaches are common and often migrainous.
Psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression
and psychosis are also well-recognized effects of
lupus.

• A full blood count should be performed
regularly to screen for anaemia, leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia.
• The urine should be checked with a dipstick
that detects blood and protein to look for signs
of nephritis.
• Urea, creatinine and electrolyte levels should
also be monitored.
• The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) will
rise during a ﬂare of SLE (Fig. 12.6), but may
sometimes be high when the patient feels quite
well. The C-reactive protein (CRP) tends to
remain normal unless infection, synovitis or
serositis is present.
• Complement levels (C3 and C4) are usually
depressed in active SLE.
• Coombs’ test will be positive in patients with
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
• Skin biopsy shows deposition of IgG and
complement at the dermal–epidermal junction
in patients with rashes (lupus ‘band’ test).
• Renal biopsy is sometimes performed to aid
diagnosis or to establish prognosis in patients
with abnormal renal function.

Haematological features
Lymphopenia is usual in active SLE. It is sometimes
difﬁcult to distinguish whether other cytopenias,
such as leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, are due
to high disease activity or bone marrow suppression
by drugs. Anaemia can be due to chronic inﬂammation or to autoimmune haemolysis, which affects at
least 5% of lupus sufferers.

Gastrointestinal (GI) features
Aseptic peritonitis can present with abdominal pain
and nausea, with or without ascites. Mild hepatosplenomegaly and vasculitis affecting the mesenteric
vessels are other possible GI manifestations.

Always consider SLE as a possible
diagnosis in a patient with multisystem
symptoms, particularly if the patient has
a raised ESR and normal CRP.

Management
General measures
Education about SLE is essential. Patients are best
advised to avoid factors that can precipitate lupus
ﬂares (see Fig. 12.2). They should wear long-sleeved
clothes and use complete sunblock in any sunny
weather. Infections should be promptly treated.

Pharmacological treatment
The choice of drug therapy in SLE depends on the
severity and nature of the disease.
Mild SLE
Patients with symptoms such as arthralgia, lethargy
or a faint rash may respond to non-steroidal anti-

80

inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or antimalarial
drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine.
Moderate SLE
Patients with more severe clinical features, such as
serositis, severe arthritis, nephritis, autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neurological or psychiatric problems often require
treatment with corticosteroids. Steroid sparing
agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil can be used.
Severe SLE
Flares of SLE that cause severe renal, neurological or
haematological problems should be treated with
cytotoxic drugs combined with corticosteroids.
Cyclophosphamide is very effective. Tacrolimus and
mycophenolate mofetil are alternatives.
Adjunctive treatment
Hypertension due to nephritis should be treated
aggressively. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusions may help immune thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. Antiplatelet drugs or warfarin are required
for patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (see below). Anticonvulsants may be required
in CNS disease.

Prognosis
The outlook for patients with SLE is improving. 5year survival is at least 90%. When deaths do occur,
they are usually a consequence of lupus nephritis,
although some are due to serious infections precipitated by cytotoxic drugs.

THE ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID
SYNDROME

Deﬁnition
The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by recurrent vascular thrombosis, fetal loss and
thrombocytopenia associated with persistently
elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies.
Antiphospholipid antibody production can complicate other autoimmune diseases, especially SLE. In
these circumstances, patients are said to have secondary antiphospholipid syndrome.

coagulant assay. Anticardiolipin antibodies bind to
cardiolipin or β2 glycoprotein-1. The lupus anticoagulant assay measures the ability of antiphospholipid antibodies to prolong clotting tests such as
the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).
Serological tests for syphilis (e.g. Venereal Disease
Research Laboratory (VDRL)) are often false biological positives. Thrombocytopenia may occur.

Pathology

Management

The two main antiphospholipid antibodies are
lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies.
Their role in thrombosis is currently being investigated. They appear to induce a procoagulant state
by binding to antigens on endothelial cells. Placental infarction is thought to be the mechanism behind
fetal loss.

General advice

Asymptomatic patients

The major features of antiphospholipid syndrome

because there is a risk of recurrent thrombosis.

results in duct dilatation, acinar atrophy and
interstitial ﬁbrosis. There is marked activation of
B-cells, resulting in increased immunoglobulin
production.

Clinical features
Sjögren’s syndrome predominantly affects people in
the fourth and ﬁfth decades. The main symptoms
are ocular or oral.

Ocular symptoms

SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME

Deﬁnition
Sjögren’s syndrome is a chronic autoimmune
disease, characterized by inﬂammation of exocrine
glands. The salivary and lacrimal glands are predominantly affected, resulting in dryness of the eyes
and mouth. Sjögren’s syndrome can be primary or
secondary (associated with other diseases). Causes
of secondary Sjögren’s syndrome are shown in
Figure 12.9.

Prevalence
The prevalence of Sjögren’s syndrome is 1–3%. It is
nine times commoner in women than men.

Aetiology
The aetiology is unknown. The primary disease has
a strong genetic association with HLA-DR3. It is
thought that some environmental factor (probably
a virus) may trigger Sjögren’s syndrome in people
with a genetic susceptibility.

Pathology
All organs affected by Sjögren’s syndrome are inﬁltrated by lymphocytes. In the salivary glands, this

Reduced tear secretion results in the destruction of
the corneal and conjunctival epithelium (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Patients complain that their eyes
feel dry, sore or gritty and they are usually red. Bacterial conjunctivitis is common.

Oral symptoms
Xerostomia (dryness of the mouth) leads to difﬁculties in swallowing dry food or talking for long
periods. On examination of the oral cavity, the
mucosa is dry, there is very little saliva and the
tongue may be ﬁssured. Dental caries is often seen
and oral candidiasis is common. Intermittent parotid
swelling affects at least half of patients with primary
Sjögren’s syndrome (Fig. 12.10), but is less common
in secondary disease.

Other symptoms of exocrine dysfunction
Secretion from other exocrine glands may be diminished, producing a variety of clinical effects. For
example, vaginal dryness can cause dyspareunia and
lack of GI mucus secretion can result in oesophagitis
or gastritis. There is an association with autoimmunity (e.g. thyroid disease).

Systemic features
Primary Sjögren’s syndrome is a systemic disease
and many patients develop extraglandular
manifestations.
• Constitutional features include fatigue, weight
loss and fever.
• Arthritis is episodic, non-erosive and very
similar to the joint disease seen in SLE.
• Raynaud’s phenomenon affects up to 50% of
patients.
• Interstitial lung disease is mild and often
subclinical.

soaked by tears is measured after 5 minutes. Wetting
of less than 5 mm suggests reduced secretion.

Rose Bengal staining
This is used to detect keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Rose
Bengal is a dye that stains damaged corneal and
conjunctival epithelium. This is seen clearly on slitlamp examination.

Salivary ﬂow rate monitoring
Salivary ﬂow rate can be monitored with an isotope
scan. This measures the rate at which a radiolabelled
dye is taken up and excreted by the salivary glands.
Both uptake and excretion are delayed in Sjögren’s
syndrome.

Labial gland biopsy and histology
Biopsy and histology of the labial glands from
behind the lower lip is a very useful test. Lymphocytic inﬁltration can be seen.

Blood tests

• Interstitial nephritis can lead to renal tubular
acidosis or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
• Vasculitis affects approximately 5% of patients
and usually causes cutaneous lesions: purpura
and ulcers.
• Neurological features vary widely. Peripheral
neuropathies result from small vessel vasculitis.
Cranial neuropathies, hemiparesis, seizures and
movement disorders can also occur.
• Lymphomas, usually B-cell, are commoner in
patients with Sjögren’s syndrome than in the
general population. They develop in the salivary
glands, reticuloendothelial system, GI tract,
lungs or kidneys.

The ESR is usually high.
A mild normocytic anaemia is common.
Immunoglobulin levels are very high.
Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, rheumatoid

Do not assume that every patient with
arthralgia and a positive rheumatoid
factor has RA. Titres of rheumatoid
factor can be very high in Sjögren’s syndrome and
patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome are often
misdiagnosed as having RA.

Management
Treatment of Sjögren’s syndrome is topical and
symptomatic. Tear substitutes such as hypromellose
eye drops help to lubricate the eyes. Occlusion of
the canaliculi can help to block the drainage of tears

weeks to months. Patients ﬁnd certain tasks increasingly difﬁcult, such as rising from a chair, climbing
the stairs or reaching for things above head
height.
Involvement of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm can affect ventilation and lead to type 2
respiratory failure. Dysphagia and regurgitation of
food result from weakness of the pharyngeal muscles
and upper third of the oesophagus. Patients may
complain of muscle pain and tenderness. Muscle
bulk and tendon reﬂexes appear normal, except in
advanced disease.

Deﬁnition

Cutaneous manifestations

Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are
autoimmune, inﬂammatory muscle diseases. DM
also affects the skin.

The skin rashes of DM usually precede the weakness.
Typical lesions are:

Xerostomia can be treated with saliva substitutes.
Pilocarpine tablets may help, but cause cholinergic
side-effects such as sweating and abdominal cramps.
Careful dental hygiene is essential to help prevent
premature caries.
Hydroxychloroquine can help the arthritis. Corticosteroids are prescribed for serious complications
like vasculitis and neurological problems.

Incidence
Both muscle diseases are rare, with a combined incidence of between 2 and 10 cases per million per
year. There is a female preponderance of 2 : 1.

Aetiology
The aetiology of PM and DM is unknown. Family
studies support a genetic predisposition. Associations with various HLA types have been reported,
but are weak.

Pathology
In both conditions, muscle ﬁbres are inﬁltrated by
inﬂammatory cells and there is subsequent degeneration, necrosis and phagocytosis. The pattern of
inﬁltration and predominant cell type allows PM to
be distinguished from DM. Skin biopsy in DM
shows the same histological features as in lupus. The
autoantibodies commonly associated with inﬂammatory muscle disease will be discussed later.

Clinical features
Inﬂammatory muscle disease can affect people of
any age, but the peak age of onset is 40–60 years.
DM is often seen in children, but PM is unusual in
this age group.

Myositis
PM and DM are characterized by symmetrical
proximal muscle weakness that develops over

84

• Gottron’s papules—erythematous, scaly papules
or plaques over the MCP and PIP joints and
also over the extensor surfaces of the knees and
elbows.
• A heliotrope rash develops on the skin over the
eyelids; lilac discoloration is often accompanied
by periorbital oedema.
• A macular erythematous rash may develop on the
face, neck, chest, shoulders and hands.
• Calcinosis—this occurs more commonly in
juvenile dermatomyositis than in adult
disease.
• Cutaneous vasculitis—can cause ulceration.
• Periungual telangiectasia may be seen and the
cuticles are often thickened and irregular.
Some patients develop typical cutaneous features of
DM without the muscle disease. They are said to
have ‘amyopathic DM’.

Extramuscular features of PM and DM
Constitutional features
Fatigue, malaise, weight loss and fever are
common.
Skeletal features
Many patients develop polyarthralgia as well as
myalgia.
Pulmonary features
Interstitial lung disease occurs in up to 30% of
cases. Ventilatory failure can result from weakness of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm.
Aspiration pneumonia is a risk in patients with
dysphagia.

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
Cardiovascular features
Myocarditis can present with cardiac failure or
arrhythmias, but most cases are asymptomatic.
Raynaud’s phenomenon and vasculitis can accompany myositis.
GI features
Vasculitis that can result in intestinal haemorrhage
or perforation is particularly common in juvenile
dermatomyositis.
Malignancy
Approximately 5–15% of adults with inﬂammatory
muscle disease have an underlying malignancy. The
association is thought to be much stronger for DM
than for PM. Malignancies reported in association
with DM include:
•
•
•
•
•

Lung.
Oesophagus.
Breast.
Colon.
Ovary.

Investigations
Serum levels of muscle enzymes
Serum levels of muscle enzymes are elevated due to
myositis. The creatine kinase is measured most commonly and in active disease is at least 10 times the
upper limit of normal.

12

Electromyography and nerve
conduction studies
Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can
show that the weakness is due to a myopathic
process, but do not give a speciﬁc diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging
MRI can identify areas of muscle inﬂammation, but
again is non-speciﬁc.

Management
Corticosteroids are used to control myositis. They
are initially prescribed at high doses. Serum creatine kinase is monitored and, as it falls, the corticosteroid dose is gradually reduced. Although the
muscle enzymes respond quickly to treatment, the
improvement in muscle strength is usually much
slower. Many patients with PM or DM require additional immunosuppressive therapy. Methotrexate
and azathioprine are commonly used. Cyclophosphamide may be prescribed for patients with severe
interstitial lung disease. Physiotherapy plays an
extremely important role in the rehabilitation of
patients with inﬂammatory muscle disease. If an
underlying malignancy is found, it should be treated
appropriately.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
The ESR is usually raised, but does not correlate well
with disease activity.

Autoantibodies
Serum autoantibodies to nuclear and/or cytoplasmic antigens are found in more than 80% of patients.
The ANA are usually positive. Approximately 30%
of patients with PM or DM have myositis-speciﬁc
antibodies. These can help predict a patient’s
prognosis and response to treatment. Anti-Jo-1 is
an anticytoplasmic antibody and is associated with
interstitial lung disease, arthralgia and Raynaud’s
phenomenon.

Muscle biopsy
This is the most deﬁnitive investigation. Histology
shows the typical inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration of
either PM or DM.

Steroid myopathy is a common
complication of treatment. It may be
difﬁcult to distinguish from active
myositis, but should be considered in patients with
normal creatine kinase levels whose muscle strength
is deteriorating.

Prognosis
The 5-year survival rate of patients with PM and
DM has improved and is currently over 80%.
However, many patients are left with signiﬁcant
persisting symptoms as a result of their disease or
therapy.

Connective tissue diseases

SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS AND
RELATED CONDITIONS

Deﬁnition
The term ‘scleroderma’ means hardening of the skin.
This is a feature of several disorders (see Fig. 12.11).
Localized cutaneous scleroderma is conﬁned to the
skin and soft tissues, whereas systemic sclerosis
(SSc) involves internal organs as well.

Incidence and prevalence
These are rare conditions. The incidence of scleroderma is 0.6–1.9 per million per year. The UK prevalence is approximately 100 per million. Women are
affected four times as often as men.

Aetiology
In most patients, the aetiology is unknown. Speciﬁc
HLA types are associated with certain subsets of
disease, but not with the disease as a whole. Exposure to certain chemicals or drugs has been associated with SSc.

Pathology
The two main pathological processes in SSc are
ﬁbrosis and microvascular occlusion. Overactive
ﬁbroblasts produce excessive extracellular matrix in
the dermis. Perivascular inﬂammatory inﬁltration
and intimal proliferation lead to narrowing of
arteries and arterioles and obliteration of capillaries. There is immune activation and release of
cytokines.

Clinical features
Localized cutaneous scleroderma
Localized scleroderma presents with painful, erythematous lesions, which later become ﬁbrotic. The
two main types are morphoea and linear scleroderma. Morphoea varies from small, discrete lesions
to large, conﬂuent patches that are uncomfortable
and disﬁguring. Linear scleroderma is commoner in
childhood. Bands of sclerosis affect the limbs and
lead to growth defects.

Systemic sclerosis
In addition to causing disﬁguring skin changes, SSc
can have profound effects on many other organs.
The disease is divided into limited cutaneous SSc
and diffuse cutaneous SSc. Limited disease is twice
as common as diffuse and is sometimes referred to
as CREST syndrome (CREST = Calcinosis, Raynaud’s
phenomenon, oEsophageal disease, Sclerodactyly
and Telangiectasia). Symptoms develop most commonly in the ﬁfth decade of life.

Skin manifestations
Scleroderma begins with an inﬂammatory phase.
The skin becomes puffy and feels tight and sometimes itchy. These symptoms typically affect the
forearms, hands and feet initially. Over several
months, skin thickening and induration develop.
Common features found on examination are:
•
•
•
•

Sclerodactyly (Fig. 12.12).
Microstomia (Fig. 12.13).
Furrowing of skin around the lips (Fig. 12.13).
Loss of normal skin creases.

changes in the ﬁngertips and possibly gangrene.
The toes, ears, nose and nipples can also be
involved.

Tethering of skin to underlying structures.
Skin hypo- or hyperpigmentation.
Flexion contractures of joints.
In the late stages of scleroderma, the skin
becomes thin and atrophic.

The skin changes differ between diffuse and limited
cutaneous systemic sclerosis. The main differences
are outlined in Figure 12.14.

The effects of systemic sclerosis on other
body systems
Involvement of internal organs is more frequent in
diffuse than in limited disease.
Cardiovascular manifestations
Raynaud’s phenomenon This occurs in nearly every
case of SSc. Severe disease may cause ischaemic

Fig. 12.13 This patient with systemic sclerosis has
microstomia and furrowing of the skin around her mouth.

Cardiac disease Disease is due to myocardial or
pericardial involvement. Myocardial ﬁbrosis can
cause cardiac failure and arrhythmias. Pericarditis is
often clinically silent.
Pulmonary disease
Pulmonary disease is the most frequent cause of
death in SSc.
Fibrosing alveolitis This affects approximately
25% of patients with limited disease and up
to 40% of those with the diffuse cutaneous
form.
Pulmonary hypertension This affects 10–20% of
patients. It can be primary (not associated with
other lung pathology) or secondary to pulmonary
ﬁbrosis. Primary pulmonary hypertension is more
common in limited cutaneous SSc, and secondary
pulmonary hypertension is more common in diffuse
cutaneous SSc.
Renal disease
Scleroderma renal crisis This implies rapidly
progressive renal failure, usually with accelerated
hypertension. It tends to occur in patients
with diffuse cutaneous disease within 5 years
of onset and is often preceded by deterioration
of skin disease. Patients present acutely with
headaches, visual disturbance and sometimes
seizures. Left ventricular failure can occur and

Connective tissue diseases
death from renal failure is likely without rapid
intervention.

• Antitopoisomerase-1 (Scl-70) antibodies are
associated with diffuse disease and a higher risk
of lung ﬁbrosis and renal involvement.

Management
Scleroderma renal crisis is a lifethreatening medical emergency that
needs urgent treatment.

GI manifestations
Scleroderma can affect any part of the GI tract, but
oesophageal problems are particularly common.
Reﬂux oesophagitis and oesophageal dysmotility
cause heartburn and dysphagia. Hypomotility can
cause bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel and
constipation in the large bowel.
Musculoskeletal complications
Most patients suffer with arthralgia and joint
stiffness at some time in their disease. Flexion
contractures of the interphalangeal joints are
common.
Scleroderma sine scleroderma
A small minority of patients have the typical vascular or internal organ features of systemic sclerosis
without skin sclerosis. They are said to have scleroderma sine scleroderma.

Investigations
The diagnosis of scleroderma is clinical. It is important to establish whether patients with SSc have
diffuse cutaneous or limited cutaneous disease, as
this determines prognosis.

Disease-modifying and
antiﬁbrotic therapy
Researchers are still trying to ﬁnd effective therapies
to modify the disease process underlying SSc. Many
drugs that affect the immune response have been
tested, but none has been very effective. Antiﬁbrotic
drugs, such as penicillamine and interferon-α, may
help prevent visceral and skin ﬁbrosis if given
early.

Screening for complications
This is a very important part in the management of
SSc. The blood pressure and renal function should
be regularly monitored. Pulmonary function tests
and echocardiography will help to detect pulmonary involvement.

Treatment of complications
A lot can be done to treat the organ-related complications. Please see Figure 12.15.

Prognosis
The survival of patients with systemic sclerosis is
improving. This probably reﬂects better management of complications. Estimates of the 5-year survival rate range from 35% to 70%.

THE VASCULITIDES

Serological tests

Deﬁnition

Antinuclear antibodies are found in 95% of patients.
The presence or absence of other autoantibodies can
help predict complications and prognosis.
For example:

Vasculitis is inﬂammation of blood vessels. It is a
feature of many illnesses and can be primary or
secondary. The primary vasculitides are uncommon
diseases in which vasculitis is the predominant
feature. Secondary vasculitis complicates other
established diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis
(RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or HIV
infection. Only primary vasculitis will be discussed
here.

• Anticentromere antibodies are associated with
limited disease and a relatively good prognosis.
They signify a risk of pulmonary hypertension,
but not pulmonary ﬁbrosis.

Aetiopathology
Vasculitis is characterized by inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration of the blood vessel wall, resulting in ﬁbrinoid necrosis. For this reason, the term ‘necrotizing
vasculitis’ is sometimes used. There is often associated granuloma formation. Vascular inﬂammation
can have severe consequences:
• Aneurysm formation can lead to rupture of
vessels and haemorrhage.
• Vessel stenosis or occlusion can lead to distal
infarction.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are
particularly speciﬁc for vasculitis and are helpful for
diagnosis and classiﬁcation. They are antibodies
that bind to antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophils. There are two types of ANCA:
• Cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) is found in
patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis and is
highly speciﬁc.
• Perinuclear staining ANCA (p-ANCA) is found
in polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis
and Churg–Strauss syndrome.

Connective tissue diseases

Clinical features
Many types of primary vasculitis are rare, and
detailed knowledge of these individual diseases is
beyond the scope of this book. This section will
therefore discuss the effects of vasculitis in general,
then describe the diseases, allocating the most space
to those that occur more frequently.
Vasculitis is potentially life-threatening. The clinical features depend on the size, site and number of
blood vessels involved. The most serious problems
are due to haemorrhage or infarction of internal
organs.

Constitutional features
All primary vasculitic illnesses can cause systemic
upset. Features such as fatigue, anorexia, weight loss
and fever are common.

Features due to involvement of different
body systems
Vasculitis can affect any system of the body
(Fig. 12.17). The patient pictured in Figure 12.18
has digital vasculitis.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and
polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)
Clinical features
Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a large vessel vasculitis.
It often co-exists with polymyalgia rheumatica

(a non-vasculitic illness) which is why they are
discussed together here. They have an incidence of
approximately 1–5 in 10 000. They both target
people over 60 years of age and are twice as
common in females than in males. About 50%
of patients with GCA have symptoms of PMR
and 20–50% of patients with PMR have GCA
symptoms.

GCA
Most symptoms are due to inﬂammation of the
carotid artery or its branches, although other large
arteries can be involved. The onset of GCA can be
insidious or abrupt, with symptoms often appearing
overnight. Patients complain of headache, scalp tenderness and sometimes pain on chewing food (jaw
claudication). The temporal artery is thickened and
tender on examination, sometimes with absent
pulsation.
The most feared complication of GCA is blindness. This is due to ischaemic optic neuritis, caused
by arteritis of the posterior ciliary artery and branches
of the ophthalmic arteries. Patients may experience
transient disturbance of vision ﬁrst. Stroke is another
serious potential complication.

PMR
Patients present with symmetrical pain and stiffness
in the shoulder and pelvic girdles. Proximal muscles
may be tender. Peripheral synovitis affecting
medium-sized joints is common.

The vasculitides

Patients with PMR often
complain of muscle weakness.
Muscle strength is usually
normal in PMR, but patients
feel weak because movements are limited by pain.

Investigations
The diagnosis of PMR is clinical. It is important to
exclude malignancy and other connective tissue diseases, which can mimic PMR.
Temporal artery biopsy is the investigation of
choice for GCA, but it is not always helpful. The
arteritis is patchy and if a ‘skip lesion’ is biopsied,
histology will be normal. Inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration, giant cells and granulomata should be seen.
The ESR is usually raised in both conditions,
often to at least 70 mm/h. However, a normal
ESR does not exclude the diagnoses. Anaemia is
common.

Management
Both GCA and PMR should be treated with corticosteroids. Prednisolone at a dose of 10–20 mg is
usually prescribed for PMR. Higher doses are
required for GCA, particularly in patients with visual
symptoms. They should be started promptly to
reduce the risk of blindness.
There is usually a dramatic response to corticosteroid therapy with symptoms improving within a
few days. Once the disease activity has been suppressed, the corticosteroid dose can be gradually
tapered. The slower the dose reduction is, the less
likely the patient is to relapse. Azathioprine and
methotrexate are sometimes used as steroid-sparing
agents if weaning off prednisolone is proving
difﬁcult.

Corticosteroids reduce the inﬂammatory
inﬁltrate within days, so a temporal
artery biopsy should be done as soon as
possible.

12

Most patients with GCA or PMR will be
taking corticosteroids for at least 1 year.
Prescription of bone-protective drugs for
the prevention of osteoporosis should be
considered.

Takayasu’s arteritis
This is a rare disease that predominantly affects
young women. The arteritis affects the aortic arch
and its branches. Symptoms are due to vascular ischaemia and include claudication, dizziness, visual
loss and stroke. Immunosuppression may help the
acute symptoms. Vascular surgery is often required
to bypass obliterated vessels.

Polyarteritis nodosa
Polyarteritis nodosa is a necrotizing arteritis that
leads to aneurysm formation. It affects men more
frequently than it does women. It is associated
with hepatitis B infection. Clinical features include
skin ulceration and rashes, peripheral neuropathy, renal disease and gut infarction, which
presents with bleeding and abdominal pain.
Angiography may show microaneurysms, which
are usually found in renal arteries and the coeliac
axis. Renal, rectal or sural nerve biopsies can be
diagnostic.
Polyarteritis nodosa is treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Cyclophosphamide
is usually used and has improved prognosis.

Kawasaki disease
(mucocutaneous lymph
node syndrome)
This vasculitis predominantly affects children
under the age of 5 years. It was ﬁrst described in
Japan, where most cases occur. It is rare in the
western world. Systemic symptoms are prominent.
Other features include desquamation of the skin
of the hands and feet, conjunctival congestion,
cervical lymphadenopathy, arthritis and coronary
arteritis, which can lead to acute myocardial
infarction.

Wegener’s granulomatosis
Wegener’s granulomatosis is a granulomatous
disorder associated with necrotizing vasculitis. It is
strongly linked with the presence of c-ANCA. The
peak age of onset is in the fourth and ﬁfth decades.
Many systems can be affected (Fig. 12.19), but it is
respiratory and renal complications that are the
most serious. Survival in Wegener’s granulomatosis
has improved dramatically since the introduction of
cyclophosphamide therapy, which is usually given
in conjunction with corticosteroids. Some patients
with limited, non-life-threatening Wegener’s granulomatosis can be treated less aggressively.

Churg–Strauss syndrome
In Churg–Strauss syndrome, granulomatous, necrotizing vasculitis is found in association with asthma
and eosinophilia. Recurrent pneumonia, heart
failure, skin lesions, mild renal impairment and
peripheral neuropathies can also occur.

Microscopic polyangiitis
Severe renal disease is the main feature of microscopic polyangiitis. Rashes, arthralgia and myalgia
are common and lung involvement can present with
asthma, pleurisy or haemoptysis.

The risk factors and diseases associated with the development of osteoporosis.
The common fractures that occur in osteoporotic patients.
Strategies for fracture prevention in osteoporosis.
The clinical features and potential complications of Paget’s disease.
The pathways of vitamin D metabolism.
The differences between rickets and osteomalacia.

OSTEOPOROSIS
Because of the ageing population, fractures resulting
from osteoporosis put enormous pressure on hospital services and incur vast costs.

Deﬁnition
Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by
decreased bone mass, leading to increased risk of
fracture. Bone mineral density (BMD) is expressed
as a T-score. This is the number of standard deviations by which the BMD varies in relation to the
mean value for young normal adults. The World
Health Organization deﬁnes osteoporosis as a Tscore of less than −2.5. Osteopenia is deﬁned as a
T-score of between −1 and −2.5.

Aetiology and pathology
Peak bone mass is usually attained by the age of 30
and thereafter declines (Fig. 13.1). Bone loss is
accelerated in osteoporosis due to an imbalance
between the rates of bone resorption and formation,
which are governed by activity of osteoclasts and
osteoblasts respectively (Fig. 13.2). Risk factors for
osteoporosis can be modiﬁable or non-modiﬁable
(Fig. 13.3).
Osteoporosis is divided into primary (idiopathic
or age-related) and secondary (resulting from
another disease process). The causes of secondary
osteoporosis are shown in Figure 13.4.

Clinical features
Patients either present with pain, deformity or
immobility due to fractures, or they are detected
by screening measurements of their BMD. Osteoporotic fractures are usually provoked by lowenergy injuries. The most common fractures are
of the spine, wrist and hip and are discussed
below.

Vertebral fractures
Vertebral compression (or wedge) fractures
(Fig. 13.5) usually present with thoracic back pain
after a minor fall. They are frequently multiple and
result in loss of height and a kyphotic deformity.
Some patients do not experience pain, but complain
that they are shrinking or becoming ‘roundshouldered’.
These are stable fractures and treatment is aimed
at controlling symptoms with analgesia. Braces are
sometimes used, but are poorly tolerated. Newer
treatments for controlling pain include vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Both involve the injection
of cement into the fractured vertebra.

Wrist
The Colles’ fracture results from a fall onto the outstretched hand (FOOSH) resulting in a dinner fork
deformity at the wrist. There is dorsal angulation
and displacement of the fracture with radial angulation and shortening (Fig. 13.6).

95

Metabolic bone disease
The fracture is usually manipulated under local
or regional anaesthesia and placed into a plaster
cast. More complex fractures may require surgery,
particularly in active patients.
The Smith’s fracture is displaced in the opposite
direction, i.e. volar or palmar displacement (Fig.
13.6). Such fractures are usually the result of a fall
onto a ﬂexed wrist.

Peak bone
mass
≈30 years

Treatment of a Smith’s fracture is difﬁcult in a
plaster cast alone and most orthopaedic surgeons
would now treat a Smith’s fracture with internal
ﬁxation.

Hip
Of the three common types of osteoporotic fracture,
hip fractures place the greatest demand on resources
and have the greatest impact on patients in terms of

mortality, disability and loss of independence.
Approximately one-third of patients with a hip fracture will die within a year of injury.
In the vast majority of cases, femoral neck
fractures are treated surgically rather than conservatively. The risk of surgery is balanced against
the risks of prolonged bed rest or traction, such as
bedsores, deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia.
Postoperative patients are mobilized early to minimize these complications. Even when faced with a
bed-bound nursing home resident, surgeons still
usually operate to provide pain relief.
Hip fractures can be divided into:
• Intracapsular fractures.
• Extracapsular fractures.

• In an intracapsular fracture (Fig. 13.7A and B),
the fracture line is between the blood supply
and the head, leading to a risk of avascular
necrosis.
• In an extracapsular fracture (Fig. 13.7C), the
head is in continuity with its blood supply and
therefore the head does not have a risk of
avascular necrosis.
This pathophysiology guides the treatment. Intracapsular fractures can be divided into undisplaced
and displaced.
• Undisplaced fractures can be treated with
internal ﬁxation.
• Displaced fractures (Fig 13.8) are treated with
hemiarthroplasty, the femoral head is removed,
leaving the artiﬁcial head articulating with the
normal acetabulum.
Extracapsular fractures are trochanteric or subtrochanteric and are treated with internal ﬁxation with
either a dynamic hip screw or an intramedullary
nail.

departments to measure BMD at the lumbar spine
and hip. BMD cannot be assessed on X-ray, but Xrays are often required to look for fractures.
A full history and examination should be performed when assessing a patient with low BMD. It
is important to enquire about risk factors for osteoporosis and to consider the presence of any underlying illnesses, such as those listed in Figure 13.4.
Osteoporosis in males and young people is more
likely to be due to a secondary cause.
Investigations to exclude a secondary cause will
be necessary in some patients. These should include
full blood count (FBC), erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR), serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase,
creatinine, electrophoresis, thyroid stimulating
hormone and parathyroid hormone. Serum testosterone should be measured in men.

Management
The aim is to reduce the risk of fractures. This can
be achieved by the following methods:

Modiﬁcation of risk factors
for osteoporosis
Patients should change any modiﬁable risk factors
for osteoporosis that they have (see Figure 13.3), for
example by stopping smoking and increasing the
amount of weight-bearing exercise they do.

Drug therapy to increase bone mass

Fig. 13.8 Displaced intracapsular hip fracture.

The subtrochanteric region is a common
place for metastatic deposits and care
must be taken not to miss these.

Diagnosis and investigation
There are several methods available for measuring
BMD. These include dual X-ray absorptiometry
(DEXA), quantitative computed tomography and
quantitative ultrasound. DEXA is used in most

98

First line therapy is usually with a bisphosphonate
in combination with calcium and vitamin D
supplements. Bisphosphonates are anti-resorptive
and work by inhibiting osteoclasts. Oestrogenreplacement therapy or raloxifene (a selective
oestrogen receptor modulator) can be used in postmenopausal women. Other agents for the treatment
of osteoporosis include calcitonin, strontium and
parathyroid hormone.

Osteoporosis is often
asymptomatic, so the
importance of treatment to
prevent fractures in the future
must be emphasized to patients.

Paget’s disease

13

Prevention of falls

Clinical features

The majority of osteoporotic fractures occur as a
result of falls. These are more common in the elderly
for a number of reasons:

Only one-third of patients are symptomatic. They
present with bone pain, deformity or fracture. Paget’s
disease can affect a single part of the skeleton or
multiple sites. The commonest sites are the pelvis,
lumbar spine, femur, skull and tibia. The affected
area may be tender and warm due to increased
blood ﬂow.
Paget’s disease is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients when an X-ray is performed for another
reason. For example, pagetic changes may be noticed
in the pelvis on an abdominal X-ray.
Figure 13.10 demonstrates some of the possible
complications of Paget’s disease. Many of these are
due to bone overgrowth which can cause localized
problems, such as deafness due to auditory nerve
entrapment. Osteosarcomas can occur in pagetic
bone, but are rare.

1. Intrinsic factors:
• Ageing process—leads to slower reaction
times (patients unable to stop falling)
• Poor mobility—patients often have other
conditions such as OA
• Poor eyesight
• Medical co-morbidity, e.g. syncope/cardiac
arrhythmia.
2. Extrinsic factors:
• Lack of social services
• Inadequate housing/unsafe local
environment.
Falls can be reduced by various interventions such
as the avoidance of drugs that have a sedative effect
or cause hypotension, the use of walking aids for
people with poor mobility and the removal of
obstacles in the home.

PAGET’S DISEASE

Diagnosis and investigation

and correlate with the extent of skeletal

Deﬁnition
Paget’s disease is a disorder of bone remodelling.

Aetiology

Large multinucleated
osteoclasts

The cause of Paget’s disease is unknown, but clustering of cases within families has been observed, suggesting a strong genetic contribution. Another
hypothesis suggests that it is triggered by a viral
infection.

Pathology
There is a dramatic increase in bone resorption,
mediated by large multinucleated osteoclasts. Osteoblasts then respond by producing weak, disorganized bone. Repeated cycles of this activity lead to
areas of bone becoming abnormally large and
deformed with increased vascularity (Fig. 13.9).

• Osteosarcoma—these tumours are highly
aggressive with a poor prognosis.
If the appendicular skeleton is involved,
resection or amputation is required
followed by chemotherapy.

Treatment
Bisphosphonates are very effective at inhibiting
bone resorption and reducing symptoms of Paget’s
disease. Calcitonin is sometimes used, but is less
well tolerated.
Surgical treatment is reserved for complications
of:
• Fracture—needs surgical stabilization.

have softening and frontal bossing of the skull.
There may be swelling of the epiphyses of the wrists
and at the costochondral junctions (the ‘rickety
rosary’). Older children develop bowing of the
long bones and valgus or varus deformities at the
knee.

Aetiology
Vitamin D deﬁciency is the commonest cause of
both conditions. Hypophosphataemia is a much
rarer cause. Figure 13.11 illustrates the pathways of
vitamin D metabolism. The causes of vitamin D
deﬁciency are shown in Figure 13.12.

Osteomalacia
Osteomalacia tends to present with vague bone
pain, especially in the long bones and pelvis. Severe,
localized pain may be due to fracture. The myopathy
is usually proximal.

Diagnosis and investigation

Histological examination of bone biopsies in both
conditions shows an increased amount of osteoid
with deﬁcient mineralization.

The many causes of hyperuricaemia.
The clinical features of acute and chronic gout.
How to investigate and manage episodes of acute gout.
The articular manifestations of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate disease (CPPD).

GOUT

Deﬁnition
Gout is a consequence of hyperuricaemia and uric
acid crystal formation. Clinical features include:
•
•
•
•

Arthritis.
Crystal deposition in the soft tissues.
Renal disease.
Urolithiasis.

Hyperuricaemia is usually due to reduced renal
urate excretion, rather than increased production
(Fig. 14.2). Diuretic therapy is probably the commonest cause of gout. Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deﬁciency is a rare
inherited disorder that causes gout in childhood.
Complete deﬁciency of HGPRT occurs in the Lesch–
Nyhan syndrome.
Some conditions are associated with gout, but do
not cause hyperuricaemia. They are shown in Figure
14.3.

Prevalence
Gout affects between 0.5 and 2.5% of people in the
western world. It used to be at least 10 times more
common in men than in women. The incidence in
women is increasing. There are important links
between blood urate and insulin resistance (syndrome X), so musculoskeletal gout may be the tip
of a cardiovascular risk ‘iceberg’.

Aetiology
Gout is caused by a sustained increase in serum uric
acid levels. Uric acid is derived from the breakdown
of purine bases, which are components of nucleic
acids. It is present in two forms in the body: uric
acid and monosodium urate. Synthesis mainly
occurs in the liver (Fig. 14.1).
Daily turnover of uric acid is high and approximately two-thirds is renally excreted. Serum levels
are related to age, sex, body mass, diet and genetic
factors. They are higher in males than in females
from puberty until the menopause, when the difference lessens.

It is important to take a
detailed drug and alcohol
history from patients
presenting with gout. Elderly
women presenting with gout are likely to be taking
diuretics, whereas younger men often have a history
of excessive alcohol consumption.

Pathology
Prolonged hyperuricaemia leads to the formation of
urate crystals. These are deposited in the synovium,
other connective tissues and the kidney. Joint inﬂammation occurs when crystals are shed from deposits
within the joint and phagocytosed by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Urate deposition in the kidney
can cause interstitial nephritis, renal stones and
acute tubular damage.

Fig. 14.4 Factors that can precipitate attacks of gout.

Clinical features
Acute gout
Acute gout is extremely painful. It typically presents
as a rapidly accelerating monoarthritis. Symptoms
often develop overnight and include severe pain and
swelling. The skin overlying the joint is usually
shiny, warm and red and the joint is extremely
tender. Attacks subside spontaneously within a few
days to a couple of weeks.
The ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is the
commonest to be affected, but the ankle, knee,
elbow, wrist and hand joints can also be involved.
A polyarticular presentation, mimicking rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is rare. Acute gout can also affect
bursae and is a common cause of olecranon bursitis.
Several factors can provoke an acute attack of gout.
These are shown in Figure 14.4.
Initially, acute attacks resolve, leaving the patient
free of symptoms. Some people have no further
problems, but most will have a further attack within
a few years. Without treatment, the acute attacks can
become more frequent, sometimes merging into
each other.

The majority of people with
hyperuricaemia never develop gout.
Asymptomatic hyperuricaemia is much
more common.

Gout

14

Investigations
Synovial ﬂuid analysis
This is the single most important test in the diagnosis of suspected gout. Synovial ﬂuid should be
obtained by needle-aspiration of symptomatic joints
and examined with a microscope under polarized
light. Monosodium urate crystals are needle-shaped
and show strong negative birefringence. This means
that crystals parallel to the plane of light appear
yellow, whereas those at right angles are blue. Aspirated material from tophi can be examined in a
similar way. Synovial ﬂuid Gram stain and culture
should be performed to exclude infection.

Synovial ﬂuid should be examined soon
after aspiration to increase the chance of
seeing crystals.

Blood tests
Fig. 14.5 Tophus formation in the pinna.

Serum uric acid should be measured, but the discovery of hyperuricaemia is not diagnostic of gout. The
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) are usually raised in acute gout and
a full blood count may reveal a polymorphonuclear
leucocytosis.

Chronic gout
Musculoskeletal features
Chronic gout occurs in patients with uncontrolled
hyperuricaemia, who have had recurrent attacks
of acute gout for years. It is characterized by
tophus formation and joint destruction. Tophi
are soft tissue deposits of urate. They commonly
develop in the digits, helix of the ear (Fig. 14.5),
bursae and tendon sheaths. They can interfere
with function and sometimes ulcerate, discharging chalky white material. Cartilage destruction
and bony erosion in chronic gout can lead to
deformities.
Renal disease
Urate deposition in the renal interstitium and
collecting tubules can cause a nephropathy.
Uric acid stones can also form in the urinary
tract.

Radiology
Radiological changes do not usually appear until
years of recurrent gouty attacks have elapsed. Radiographs show soft tissue swelling and opacities due
to tophi. Erosions may be seen. They typically have
overhanging edges and, unlike in RA, the surrounding bone is sclerotic.

Management
Management of acute gout
Acute gout should be treated promptly with one of
the following drugs:
• Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) are used most commonly, and
should be continued until the pain and
inﬂammation subside.

• Colchicine should be used at a dose of 500 μg
twice or thrice daily as higher doses often cause
gastrointestinal side-effects.
• Corticosteroids are a useful therapy for patients
who are unable to tolerate NSAIDs or
colchicine. They should not be used for longterm treatment.

Prophylactic therapy
Drugs that lower serum urate can be used to
prevent attacks of gout: indications for prophylactic treatment are listed in Figure 14.6. Allopurinol
is the most popular drug. It reduces uric acid synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase.
Other drugs work by increasing renal urate
excretion.
Changes in the serum urate can precipitate episodes of gout. Urate-lowering therapy should not be
commenced until an acute attack has settled completely and NSAIDs or colchicine should be coprescribed for the ﬁrst few months.

Prevalence
CPPD disease is less common than gout, but estimates of prevalence vary greatly. It is predominantly
a disease of the elderly and has a slight female
preponderance.

Aetiology
The cause of CPPD deposition is unknown. Associations with osteoarthritis (OA) and various metabolic diseases are recognized (Fig. 14.7), but not
well understood.

Pathology
CPPD crystals are deposited mainly in cartilage, but
also in the synovium, joint capsule and tendons.

Clinical features
The two main clinical presentations of CPPD disease
are:

Correction of risk factors

• Acute synovitis (pseudogout).
• Chronic arthritis (pyrophosphate arthropathy).

Attempts should be made to identify each patient’s
risk factors for gout. The factors listed in Figure 14.4
that are known to precipitate acute attacks should
be avoided if possible.

Pseudogout

CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE
DIHYDRATE (CPPD) DISEASE

Deﬁnition
CPPD disease is an arthropathy associated with
the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate
crystals. It can present as an acute synovitis,
often referred to as ‘pseudogout’, or as a chronic
arthritis.

106

This is the commonest cause of acute monoarthritis
in the elderly. Patients present with an acute onset
of joint pain, stiffness and swelling, sometimes
accompanied by fever. The knee is the commonest
site, but the ankle, wrist, elbow and shoulder are
also targets. Attacks rarely affect more than one joint
at a time. As with gout, examination reveals a
swollen, erythematous and tender joint. Attacks
usually resolve within a few weeks.

Chronic pyrophosphate arthropathy
This has many similarities to OA. Onset is gradual
and symptoms include pain, stiffness and loss of

14

Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) disease
function. Commonly affected joints are knees, hips,
shoulders, elbows, wrists and metacarpophalangeals
(MCPs; particularly the 2nd and 3rd). Some patients
develop acute attacks of synovitis. Examination
reveals signs of OA, at times with synovitis. Pyrophosphate arthropathy can be distinguished from
OA by the involvement of wrists, elbows and ankles
and the episodes of synovitis.

Investigations
Synovial ﬂuid examination
Synovial ﬂuid examination with polarized light
microscopy is the key to the diagnosis. The CPPD
crystals are either rhomboid or rod-shaped and
show weak positive birefringence. Gram stain and
culture of synovial ﬂuid should be performed to
exclude infection.

Radiology
CPPD causes the following radiographic signs:
• Chondrocalcinosis.
• OA-like changes.
Calciﬁcation of cartilage (chondrocalcinosis) is
often seen in the menisci of the knee, triangular
cartilage of the wrist (Fig 14.8) and the symphysis
pubis. The cartilage loss, sclerosis, cysts and osteophytes seen in OA all occur in pyrophosphate
arthropathy.

Other investigations
CPPD deposition in younger patients is unusual and
should be investigated by screening for the underlying associated metabolic disorders (see Fig. 14.7).

Management
Attacks of pseudogout should be treated with
analgesics. Joint aspiration and corticosteroid
injection often produce rapid relief of symptoms,
and colchicine can also be effective. Unlike gout,
there is no speciﬁc treatment for chronic pyrophosphate arthropathy. It should be managed in
a similar way to OA, with emphasis on weight

triangular cartilage.

reduction, physiotherapy, pain control and, when
necessary, joint replacement. Episodes of synovitis
can be improved by intra-articular corticosteroid
injection.

Objective
You should be able to:
• Describe normal variations of gait and joints commonly referred to paediatric clinics.
• Recognize the clincal features of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and
know how to investigate and treat it.
• Recognize and describe features of Perthes disease and a slipped upper femoral
epiphysis (SUFE).
• Describe the different ages that the three childhood hip conditions usually present
and know how to treat these conditions.
• Recognize the clinical features of clubfoot.
• Describe features and management of osteogenesis imperfecta.
• Understand the common causes of knee pain in children including Osgood–Schlatter
disease and osteochondritis dissecans.
• Deﬁne and describe the features of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and understand the
management principles.
• Know the orthopaedic problems associated with cerebral palsy.

Of all the joint disorders affecting children the most
important to the orthopaedic surgeon are those
affecting the hip. Many of these children will require
hip replacement surgery in adult life with the most
severely affected having such surgery in their 20s or
30s.

Toe walkers

NORMAL VARIANTS

In-toeing gait

The majority of referrals to paediatric orthopaedic
surgeons are for normal variations in growth of a
healthy child brought in by anxious parents. The
single most reassuring feature is the symmetrical
appearance of the limb. If the child has only one
side affected then the condition is much more likely
to be pathological.
Examples of normal conditions commonly
referred are:

Flat feet
This condition is usually physiological, painless and
may be associated with laxity of ligaments. Simple
advice only is required as even the use of insoles is
questionable and most children develop normally
regardless. Pain or ﬁxed deformity suggests an
underlying pathological condition.

Often a child who is beginning to walk does so on
tiptoes. Usually the child ‘grows out’ of this but
examination is required to exclude a tight Achilles
tendon or an underlying condition such as cerebral
palsy.

Causes of in-toeing are at three levels: the hip, the
tibia and the foot.
Persistent femoral torsion leaves the patient with
an excessive internal rotation and the child often
sits in a W position rather than cross-legged (Fig.
15.1).
The natural history of this condition is of spontaneous resolution as the child grows, but a small
number require femoral osteotomy.
Internal tibial torsion also results in in-toeing but
almost always resolves with no treatment.
In the foot, metatarsus adductus (inwardly pointing forefoot) is the cause of in-toeing and again this
usually resolves over time.

Bow legs (genu varum)
It is normal for toddlers to have bow legs and they
almost always grow out of this over time. Very rarely,

109

Paediatric joint disease

majority of these settle, stabilize and develop normally without treatment.

Aetiology and pathology
The condition is seven times more common in
females. It is also more common in certain races
(northern Italy and North American indigenous
population).
DDH is associated with:
• Breech presentation.
• Family history.
• Other congenital deformities.

Fig. 15.1 Child sitting in the ‘W’ position in excessive
femoral anteversion.

pathological conditions such as rickets can cause
bowing but the child is usually older and the disease
on one side only.

Knock knees (genu valgum)
Older children 3–8 years old gradually become
more valgus as they grow normally, and again the
majority straighten spontaneously. Pathological
genu valgum is rare, usually asymmetrical, severe
and progressive.

PAEDIATRIC HIP DISORDERS

Developmental dysplasia of the
hip (DDH)
Introduction
Previously called CDH (congenital dislocation of
the hip) this disorder is due to failure of normal
development of the acetabulum resulting in abnormal hip anatomy. This disorder encompasses the
spectrum of disease from a frankly dislocated hip to
acetabular dysplasia (in which the slope of the acetabulum is too steep).

The left side is more commonly affected but the
condition is bilateral in 20%.
The acetabulum relies on the presence of the
femoral head for normal development. In DDH
there is excessive laxity of the joint with a shallow
acetabulum (socket) (Fig. 15.2). This allows the
femoral head to develop out of the socket, in severe
cases forming a false acetabulum (located above the
normal one).

Clinical features
The majority are picked up on routine baby check
and referred appropriately.
Late-presenting DDH can occur as the child
begins to walk. The child will have a limp and shortness of one leg (if unilateral).
The clinical ﬁndings of DDH include:
• Loss of abduction.
• Leg length discrepancy.
• Asymmetrical posterior skin crease.
The special tests for dislocated hips are called Barlow’s and Ortolani’s tests.

Incidence

Barlow’s test
This is an attempt to dislocate a reduced hip.
The examiner’s hand is placed so that the child’s
knee is ﬂexed to 90° and the examiner’s thumb is
on the medial aspect of the thigh with the middle
ﬁnger on the trochanter (Fig. 15.3). The child’s hip
is ﬂexed to 90° and slightly adducted with a slightly
downward force applied to try to dislocate the hip.
A clunk is felt if positive.

The incidence is approximately 2 per 1000, although
at birth 5–20 per 1000 hips will be unstable. The

Ortolani’s test
This is an attempt to reduce a dislocated hip.

Both hips are examined together. The hand is
placed in a similar position and the hip is ﬂexed to
90° and then gently abducted. The test is positive if
the hip reduces with a clunk.

Diagnosis and investigation
All babies are screened clinically by examination at
birth but unfortunately this is unreliable. At-risk
babies with the factors listed above are screened
with ultrasound. If there is doubt this investigation
can be repeated.
An older child should be investigated with X-rays,
which once the femoral head has ossiﬁed should
clearly show if there is a dislocation (Fig. 15.4).

Management
This depends on whether the hip is dislocated and,
if so, whether the hip is easily reducible.

Conservative
A Pavlik harness abducts the leg, keeping the hip in
joint.
Surgical
If the hip is not reduced, closed or open, reduction
is performed.
A variety of surgical osteotomies to the pelvis or
femur can be used to maintain reduction and ‘normalize anatomy’.

Prognosis
The outcome depends upon the degree of dysplasia
and whether or not complications such as osteonecrosis develop. Secondary osteoarthritis is common
in this group of patients.

Introduction
This is a rare disease in which there is segmental

initially showing collapse and fragmentation followed by repair and eventual remodelling, which
may take many years.
Variable amounts of the head are involved and
this has an effect on outcome. Sometimes the head
migrates out of the joint (subluxation).

Clinical features
The child (usually a boy) presents with a gradual
history of hip or knee pain associated with a limp.
Clinical features will show loss of hip motion,
particularly abduction, and there may be ﬁxed deformity. Complete loss of abduction is a worrying sign
and may signify subluxation of the hip.

Diagnosis and investigation
Perthes disease in an acutely presenting child could
be confused with septic arthritis and therefore blood
tests including white cell count (WCC) and inﬂammatory markers should be performed (all normal in
Perthes disease).
A plain X-ray (Fig. 15.5) is the mainstay of diagnosis. The features of Perthes on X-ray are:
• Loss of epiphyseal height.
• Increased density.
• Subchondral fracture, partial collapse and
fragmentation of the head.

112

Fig. 15.5 X-ray of Perthes disease.

• Abnormal shape and size of femoral head.
• Subluxation.

Treatment
This depends upon the age of the patient and the
extent of the disease.
Conservative
75% of children require no treatment and will have
a good long-term outcome. Young patients with less
than 50% involvement of the femoral head have a
good prognosis.
Surgical
Older patients (8 years) with greater than 50%
involvement have a poor prognosis, and signiﬁcant
early osteoarthritis is likely. These children may
require containment of the femoral head with
surgery, e.g. a pelvic or femoral osteotomy.

Slipped upper femoral
epiphysis (SUFE)
This condition is a disorder in which there is structural failure through the growth plate of an immature hip.

Incidence
Approximately 3 per 100 000 children are affected.
It is more common in boys than in girls, usually
occurring during the early adolescence growth spurt
between 11 and 14 years of age.

Aetiology and pathology
Classically the boy is overweight and has delayed
puberty.

Congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)
The exact cause is not known but may relate to
failure of the epiphyseal cartilage to mature as the
child grows. Some hormonal conditions are
associated.
The slip results in the epiphysis lying posterior
and inferior to the femoral neck.
Approximately 60% are bilateral.

Clinical features
The child presents with groin or knee pain (or both)
and a limp. The history can be acute or gradual.
Examination ﬁndings reveal an external rotation
deformity with limitation of most movements.
There may be a slight leg length discrepancy. Check
for evidence of hypogonadism, hypopituitarism and
hypothyroidism.

Diagnosis and investigation
Diagnosis is based on X-ray changes. An anteroposterior (AP) X-ray is taken, but it is the frog lateral
which most clearly demonstrates the pathology (Fig.
15.6).

Management
Surgical
All slips should be urgently ﬁxed in situ to prevent
further displacement.
Attempts to reduce severe slips are associated
with avascular necrosis.

Prognosis
There is a high incidence of secondary degenerative
osteoarthritis.

15

The age of the child at presentation
gives the biggest clue to the diagnosis.
DDH is diagnosed at birth. Septic
arthritis usually occurs between the ages of 0 and 5
years. Perthes disease presents between the ages of
4 and 10 years. SUFE usually presents in overweight
adolescent boys approximately 11–14 years old.

CONGENITAL TALIPES
EQUINOVARUS (CLUBFOOT)
Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) encompasses a deformity of the lower limb with calf
wasting and the classical inwardly pointing foot.

Incidence
The incidence is approximately 1 per 1000 live
births. Males are affected twice as often as
females.

Aetiology and pathology
The exact aetiology is not known but arrest of normal
limb bud development in utero may be the cause.
Genetic factors play a role, with family history being
important.
The basic pathology is at the level of the subtalar
joint with a cavus deformity (high arch) and metatarsus adductus (Fig. 15.7). The Achilles tendon is
also tight, resulting in an equinus deformity.
Associated soft tissue contractures occur on the
medial side.

Clinical features
The condition is easily noted at birth as a ﬁxed
varus and equinus deformity of the foot. The calf is
underdeveloped when compared with the normal
side.
The baby should be examined for associated syndromes or conditions (such as DDH).

Diagnosis and investigation
Fig. 15.6 X-ray of SUFE.

The diagnosis is a clinical one and X-rays are usually
taken after initial treatment or surgery.

113

Paediatric joint disease

Aetiology and pathology
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is usually inherited as
an autosomal dominant condition, although sporadic and recessive cases can occur.
There are four different types of OI.
The primary abnormality is a defect in the synthesis of type 1 collagen.

Clinical features
The child may present with a low-energy fracture
and the diagnosis is made subsequently, following
examination and investigation.
Blue sclera are pathognomonic but not always
present. Children are usually small with bony deformities (including scoliosis) and joint abnormalities.
Associated features include deafness and joint
laxity.

Diagnosis and investigation
X-rays may show:
• Multiple fractures.
• Deformity.
• Thin-looking cortex.
Fig. 15.7 Untreated talipes.

Management
Conservative
Initial treatment is with serial casting changed
weekly for up to 3 months.
Surgical
Surgery is reserved for those that fail to correct fully
or for later recurrence.

Prognosis
The foot and limb will never be normal in terms of
appearance but most patients lead a normal life.

Treatment
Conservative
Gentle handling is needed to prevent fractures.
Bisphosphonates such as pamidronate can be
given intravenously to try to improve bone
strength.
Surgical
Shefﬁeld intramedullary telescoping rods are the
mainstay of treatment for prevention of deformity
and further fracture.
Established deformity is treated with osteotomy.

Prognosis
The outcome depends on the type of OI; some are
incompatible with life.

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA
Also known as brittle bone disease, this disorder
predisposes to multiple fractures.

CEREBRAL PALSY (CP)
Deﬁnition

Incidence
The condition is rare.

114

This is a non-progressive neuromuscular disorder
that results from injury to an immature brain.

Paediatric knee conditions

Incidence
2 per 1000 births.

Aetiology and pathology
The cause is often unknown, but can include prematurity, perinatal anoxia, perinatal infection including meningitis, and kernicterus.

Clinical features
There is a mixture of muscle weakness and spasticity. This leads to characteristic joint deformities (see
Fig. 15.8). There may be athetosis and ataxia. This
can be associated with varying degrees of cognitive
impairment and emotional disturbance. Children
may also develop seizures.

Diagnosis and investigation
CP is a clinical diagnosis which is based on a thorough birth and developmental history and is
normally apparent within the ﬁrst 2 years of life.
MRI of the brain may show periventricular
leukomalacia.

Management
Conservative
Depending upon the severity of the disease, children
will beneﬁt from physiotherapy, occupational
therapy, speech and language therapy and other
forms of special needs care.
Surgical
In children who have not developed ﬁxed contractures, intramuscular botulinum injections can temporarily reduce spasticity. For ﬁxed deformity, soft
tissue release or tendon lengthening is required to
improve function. Severe muscle imbalance can
result in bone deformity, sometimes requiring corrective osteotomy.

15

NON-ACCIDENTAL INJURY
Non-accidental injury (NAI) is becoming increasingly recognized and is often diagnosed late but it
is important as the child may die.

Clinical features
The history is often vague, inappropriate or changes
each time it is told. In young children (<2 years) it
is rare for accidental fractures to occur, particularly
in long bones. Late presentation is often a feature of
NAI.
The child may have external features of abuse
such as bruising in other areas of the body away
from the fracture. The child may be withdrawn, particularly when the parents are present.

Diagnosis and investigation
In suspected cases a skeletal survey or bone scan is
performed to look for occult fractures. Certain fractures such as of the rib or tibial metaphysis are
typical of NAI.
Conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta can
be confused with NAI.

Management
The child should be admitted for protection if NAI
is strongly suspected and the fracture should be
treated in the usual way.
Paediatricians and social workers are involved.

Prognosis
A child left in an abusing environment has a 5% risk
of death.

Incidence
The condition is common, usually in adolescent
boys.

Surgery is used only for a painful ossicle.

Prognosis

Osteochondritis dissecans
Deﬁnition
Osteochondritis dissecans is a small area of avascular bone on an articular surface, usually of the
knee.

Incidence
Fig. 15.9 Osgood–Schlatter disease.

The incidence is 4 per 1000.
Presentation is between 10 and 20 years of age
and is more common in boys.

Aetiology and pathology

Aetiology and pathology

It occurs during a period of rapid growth and is
related to the pulling force of the patellar ligament
on the tibial tuberosity (Fig. 15.9).
It is more common in athletic individuals.

The condition is most common in the knee (medial
femoral condyle) but can affect other joints.
It is thought to be due to repeated trauma in a
susceptible patient.

Clinical features

Clinical features

The patient complains of localized pain over the
tubercle. The pain is usually made worse by activity
and relieved by rest.
Clinically a tender swollen tuberosity is found.

The patient has intermittent ache, swelling and
‘catching’ in the knee. The patient may complain of
the knee giving way owing to acute sharp episodes
of pain.

Diagnosis and investigation
Fragmentation and sclerosis of the tibial tuberosity
is present.
Sometimes a visible ossicle remains.

Management
Conservative
Treatment is with rest if the knee is very inﬂamed,
with simple analgesia and modiﬁcation of
activities.
Parents are usually very worried and need
reassurance.
The child may choose to ‘put up’ with the pain
and continue sporting activities but this has no detrimental effect and will not prolong the natural
history of the disease process.

116

Diagnosis and investigation
X-rays show a variably sized lesion on the medial
femoral condyle, which is fragmented in the child
but in mature adults the lesion shows as a clear,
demarcated sclerotic zone. The lesion can be attached
or be a loose body.
CT scan further deﬁnes the lesion, although MRI
has superseded this. An isotope bone scan conﬁrms
the presence of activity and hence healing
potential.

Management
Conservative
Activity modiﬁcation with avoidance of sporting
activity is adequate to allow small well-ﬁxed lesions
to heal.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Surgical
Lesions that become detached or give signiﬁcant
persistent symptoms require surgical stabilization. If
the fragment becomes a loose body, removal may
be the only option.

JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS
Deﬁnition
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is persistent inﬂammatory arthritis occurring in childhood. It does not
include ‘speciﬁc’ diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or the arthritis of inﬂammatory
bowel disease.
JIA has been classiﬁed into seven subtypes (see
Fig. 15.10). This classiﬁcation is based partly on the
number of joints involved 3 months into the disease
process. It is useful as it gives a guide to prognosis.

Clinical features
Joint disease
Children develop symptoms and signs of joint
inﬂammation similar to those in adults, including
joint pain, stiffness and swelling. Presentation
depends on the joints affected and the age of the
child. A 12-year-old with knee synovitis will complain of pain, whereas a 2-year-old may just be irritable and reluctant to mobilize.
Eye disease
Some forms of JIA can be associated with anterior
uveitis. Acute anterior uveitis presents with pain and
redness of the eye. Chronic anterior uveitis, however,
is more insidious and can cause signiﬁcant visual
loss.
Constitutional symptoms
Fatigue, malaise and other systemic symptoms affect
JIA patients, in particular those with systemic onset

disease. Growth retardation is an important consequence of prolonged inﬂammation in childhood.
JIA subtypes
Oligoarticular disease Between one and four joints
are affected, commonly in the lower limb. The prognosis is good; many children ‘grow out of it’. This
group of patients has the greatest risk of developing
chronic anterior uveitis.
Extended oligoarticular disease Initially fewer than
four joints are involved, but these patients gradually
develop a polyarthritis after the ﬁrst 3 months. The
outcome is often poor.
Polyarticular disease More than four joints are
affected from an early stage. There are two types.
Rheumatoid factor negative arthritis targets small
and large joints and tends to persist into adult life.
Rheumatoid factor positive arthritis is the equivalent of adult RA. It is seen mainly in teenage girls
and frequently has a poor outcome.
Systemic onset disease This arthritis is characterized
by prominent systemic symptoms. It was previously
known as Still’s disease. Patients present with a
swinging fever, plus any of the following features:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Evanescent rash.
Hepatomegaly.
Splenomegaly.
Anaemia.
Lymphadenopathy.
Serositis, especially pericarditis.

The differential diagnosis includes infection and
malignancy. Joint involvement may be mild or
absent initially.
Enthesitis-related arthritis Inﬂammation of entheses, e.g. Achilles tendonitis, is a prominent feature.
Enthesitis-related arthritis encompasses juvenile
ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A positive family
history of AS or related diseases is common and
patients are often HLA-B27 positive.
Psoriatic arthritis This is usually oligoarticular and
often involves weight-bearing joints. A personal or
family history of psoriasis is common.

Investigations
The diagnosis of JIA is essentially clinical. X-rays are
helpful in excluding other causes of joint pain, such
as malignancy, but are usually normal in early JIA.

117

Paediatric joint disease
Blood tests are useful, but not diagnostic. Full blood
count may reveal anaemia or thrombocytosis and
the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Creactive protein (CRP) are usually elevated. Serum
rheumatoid factor should be measured. It is also
important to know if the patient has positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), as they are associated
with an increased risk of uveitis.

Management

All children with JIA should be seen by a
specialist.

Physiotherapy
This is vital to maintain mobility and function.
Hydrotherapy is commonly used and is popular
with children. Splinting is sometimes required to
prevent deformity.
Drug treatment
Initial treatment is with non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Disease-modifying therapy with drugs

118

such as methotrexate is used when symptoms persist.
Corticosteroids may be necessary in severe or systemic onset disease. Biological agents, such as the
anti-tumour necrosis factor-α drugs, are indicated
for seriously ill children with persistent major synovitis or systemic features.
Eye screening
Children should have their eyes examined regularly
by an ophthalmologist.

Eye screening is particularly important in
young children with JIA, as they do not
reliably report visual disturbance to their
parents.

Fractures

16

Objectives
You should be able to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Understand the terms ‘fracture’ and ‘pathological fracture’.
Classify and describe fractures.
Recognize the clinical features of a broken bone and know how to investigate this.
Understand the basic principles of fracture management.
Describe some of the common methods of surgical ﬁxation of fractures.
Describe the complications of fractures.

In this chapter we will discuss the basic principles
of managing fractures.
Advanced trauma life support and the management of a multiply injured patient is covered in
Chapter 17.

Incidence
Fractures are very common and most of us will have
at least one during a lifetime. They occur in peaks
during childhood, young adult life and again in the
elderly when osteoporosis has weakened bony structure (see Ch. 13).

Deﬁnition
A fracture is a break in the continuity of the cortex
of the bone.

Pathology and aetiology
Fractures can occur through normal bone if the
force applied is large enough, or be pathological
and occur through abnormal or diseased bone.
Figure 16.1 shows the causes of pathological
fractures.
In children the fracture may occur through the
growth plate (physis), and these injuries are classiﬁed as shown in Figure 16.2.
The mechanism of injury dictates the fracture
pattern. A twisting injury produces a spiral fracture
and a direct blow from the side a transverse or
oblique fracture. See Figure 16.3.

As the force applied increases so does the severity
of injury; a patient falling 50 feet will have more
serious injuries than one twisting an ankle. A bone
fails because the load exceeds its strength.
Fractures can be open (associated with a wound;
see Fig. 16.4 and Ch. 17) or closed (skin intact).
Open fractures allow contamination of the bone
ends, predisposing to deep bony infection (see
Ch. 18).
Injuries may also involve the joint surface (intraarticular) or the bone may be in lots of pieces
(comminuted).
A segmental fracture occurs in the diaphysis
(shaft) at two levels, leaving a ‘ﬂoating segment’.
When concentrating on the bone it is easy to
forget the soft tissues surrounding the bone. It is the
soft tissues that will eventually provide a healing
environment via blood vessel attachment to the
injured bone.

Clinical features
The patient almost always gives a clear history of an
injury such as falling off a slide, playing football or
a simple trip. Difﬁculty can arise if the patient
cannot give a history (e.g. because of dementia), in
which case the history may be obtained from the
carer or a relative but sometimes there is no history
of a fall.
Patients will complain of severe pain and they
may have noticed a deformity (e.g. ‘my ankle pointed
the wrong way, doctor’).

Fig. 16.1 Underlying causes in pathological fractures.

The whole patient should be examined for associated injuries and then the injured limb.
The affected limb will be swollen and bruised
with signiﬁcant tenderness to palpation. Fracture
crepitus can be felt and heard on movement but this
is cruel and unnecessary (plus moving the fracture
excessively may further damage soft tissues).
It is very important to note:
• Skin condition (i.e. open or closed, but also
note blisters and abrasions).
• Peripheral nerve function—any weakness or
numbness of the hand or foot.
• Distal vascular status—assess peripheral pulse
and capillary reﬁll.
Compare the abnormal with the normal limb.
The patient may also have a clinical deformity
associated with a particular fracture, such as a dinner
fork deformity in Colles’ fracture.
Patients with suspected spinal injuries need to be
log-rolled for examination and a full peripheral
nervous system examination performed.

Diagnosis and investigation
X-rays should be taken in two planes at 90° to each
other (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral) to give accurate information on the suspected fractured bone
(Fig. 16.5). If there may be an associated joint injury,
X-rays of the joint are needed. Special views are taken
for certain fractures (e.g. scaphoid views).

120

Type IV
Fracture crosses physis and
involves joint interface
Requires accurate reduction to
prevent growth problems
leading to deformity
Type V
Crush injury
Difficult to initially diagnose
becomes obvious later when
growth arrest occurs

Fig. 16.2 The Salter–Harris classiﬁcation of fractures of the
growth plate (physeal fractures).

Computed tomography (CT) scans are helpful to
plan surgery in very severe multi-fragmentary intraarticular fractures.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or isotope
bone scans are occasionally used to diagnose a fracture where doubt exists. MRI is also useful in the
follow-up of certain fractures to look for avascular
necrosis.

Describing fractures
This is something all medical students are very bad
at!

• General condition of patient
• Skin (open or closed)
• Neurovascular status.

Often the decision about
whether or not to operate on
a patient’s wrist fracture is
difﬁcult. If non-operative
treatment is chosen it is important to warn the
patient if a deformity is likely once they come out
of plaster. Most patients function very well without
pain despite having a “crooked looking wrist” and
are happy to accept this if it is explained clearly.

• Stabilization (maintain reduction until healing
occurs).
• Rehabilitation (rehabilitate the limb and the
person back to normality).

Reduction
Reduction can be performed open or closed.

The basic principles for the treatment of any fracture
are:

• Closed reduction is performed by manipulating
the fracture into position. A Colles’ fracture is a
good example of a fracture treated with closed
reduction.
• Open reduction is performed in the operating
theatre and involves a surgical procedure to
open up the fracture site and accurately reduce
the bones under direct vision.

• Reduction of any deformity (displacement,
angulation, rotation), i.e. put the bones back
into the correct place.

Intra-articular fractures are treated with open reduction so that the joint can be accurately reduced,
minimizing the risk of secondary osteoarthritis.

Stabilization

Operative

The fracture can be stabilized by conservative or
operative treatment. The choice of treatment depends
on the bone and fracture characteristics.
Internal ﬁxation allows early mobilization and
prevents displacement but there are risks of
surgery.
Plaster casts avoid the risk of surgery but there is
a chance the fracture will re-displace, and deformity
may result if malunion occurs.

Operative treatment is always required for open
fractures and displaced intra-articular fractures.
Other fractures may be treated in this way, particularly if they are unstable.
There are several different methods of surgical
stabilization (Fig. 16.7):

Conservative
A plaster of Paris cast is the most common form of
conservative treatment used.
The cast should immobilize the joint above and
below the fracture and be moulded into position
in order to minimize the position ‘slipping’ in a
cast.
Traction used to be widespread on orthopaedic
wards but is rarely used nowadays. Traction uses
weight to pull fracture fragments into alignment and
maintain reduction. The disadvantage of traction is
the prolonged treatment with risks of bedsores, deep
vein thrombosis (DVT) and chest complications.

1. Percutaneous wiring: commonly performed at
the wrist. Wires are passed across the fracture
site to hold the bone reduced. They are
removed at 4–6 weeks.
2. Internal ﬁxation: a plate and screws hold the
fracture rigidly.
3. Intramedullary nail: a nail is passed in the
medullary cavity and locked at both ends. This
is commonly used in the tibia and femur.
4. External ﬁxation: pins or wires inserted into the
bone are held by a ‘frame’ externally.

Rehabilitation
Following healing, or if the fracture is stable, the
limb can be mobilized and range of movement
exercises begun. The physiotherapist may need to

instruct the patient in the use of crutches for restricted
weight bearing.
Rehabilitation of the limb may often take as
much time as the fracture took to heal.
Following a hip fracture elderly patients require
intensive input from physiotherapy, occupational
therapy and social workers in order to become selfcaring and safe prior to discharge.

Complications of fractures
Any complication can be local or general, and
immediate, early or late.

Immediate
Local
Initial displacement can cause the skin to tear,
resulting in an open fracture. Fracture fragments
may press on nerves, producing a nerve palsy
(common in the humerus, resulting in radial nerve
palsy) or blood vessels, producing ischaemia (e.g.
femur—popliteal vessels). See Figure 16.8.
Very occasionally nerves and blood vessels are
torn completely and repair is needed.
General
Haemorrhage from fractures can be excessive, especially from femoral, pelvis, open or multiple fractures. Hypovolaemic shock may result.

Fractures

Early
Local
Compartment syndrome This is an important complication and results from excessive pressure developing in closed fascial muscle compartments.
Following a fracture, swelling can cause the blood
supply to the muscle to be impaired. This occurs at
the level of small vessels, and peripheral pulses are
usually still present. The patient will complain of
excessive pain (more than normal) and pain on
passive movement of the digits is demonstrated.
Paraesthesia develops early as a result of ischaemia
of the nerves. The diagnosis is clinical (sometimes
conﬁrmed with pressure monitoring), and if present
requires urgent surgical fasciotomy (release of
compartments).
Infection This can occur early or late following
operative stabilization or open fracture. See Chapter
18.
Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) This
unusual condition can occur after any injury or
operation. The exact cause is not known but is
thought to relate to the sympathetic nervous
system.
Usually the upper limb is affected. The patient
has red, swollen shiny ﬁngers with excessive joint
stiffness. Atypical pain is also a feature. Physiotherapy is the mainstay of this difﬁcult condition.
General
Deep vein thrombosis DVT can occur after any
lower limb injury. Prevention in the form of
mechanical (foot pumps, graduated compression
stockings) or chemical (heparin, aspirin) agents is
routinely used.
Diagnosis is often difﬁcult as the limb will be
swollen and may be painful because of the injury.
If in doubt obtain a duplex scan or venogram. Some
at-risk patients are treated prophylactically with
warfarin.
Fat embolus This important condition is common
after long bone fractures (particularly of the femur)
and occurs due to fat entering the circulation and
embolizing to the lungs. The condition occurs
because the medullary canal of long bones contains
fat. Early stabilization of fractures reduces the
risk.

16

The patient presents with shortness of breath,
petechial haemorrhages and sometimes confusion
from low circulating Po2 usually 2–3 days after
injury.
This condition is potentially very serious and
may lead on to acute adult respiratory failure
(ARDS), which can be fatal.
Treatment is supportive with oxygen and ﬂuids.
Transfer to a high-dependency unit is advised.

Late
Delayed union/non-union
Some fractures are slow to unite or fail to do so
despite adequate treatment. Certain fractures (e.g. of
the tibia) are more prone to this and it is more likely
if the initial injury was high energy or complicated
by compartment syndrome. Further surgery may be
required to encourage the bone to heal.
Malunion
The fracture heals but in an abnormal position. This
is usually due to inadequate stabilization of the fracture. The resulting deformity may reduce movement
in an associated joint and predisposes to late
arthritis.
Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis, which is discussed in Chapter 9, is
more common after intra-articular fractures.
Stiffness
Prolonged immobilization can result in severe joint
stiffness.
Contracture
Untreated compartment syndrome or vascular complication can result in contracture. Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture is an example.
Growth disturbance
Fractures occurring through the growth plate can
cause deformity if the growth arrest is partial (i.e.
one side of the limb grows, the other does not) or
shortness of the limb if complete. Treatment of such
problems is complex.

Objectives
You should be able to:
•
•
•
•

Understand the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS).
Deﬁne and understand the management of open fractures.
Understand basic spine anatomy and recognize structures that can be injured.
Understand the signs and consequences of pelvic trauma.

When taking a history from a multiply
injured patient, the assessment should
be rapid to avoid delays in diagnosis of
life threatening conditions. Speciﬁcally ask about
signiﬁcant past medical history or illnesses, allergies,
and drug history. Seek a collateral history from
others such as paramedics or people at the scene
for clues about the mechanism (e.g. damage to the
car) and to gain an idea of the patient’s initial
condition.

Deﬁnition
Trauma can refer to any bodily injury but in the
context of surgery normally refers to a patient with
major isolated or multiple injuries.

Incidence
Trauma is the leading cause of death in the ﬁrst four
decades of life, the majority from road trafﬁc
accidents.

Clinical features
The Advanced Trauma Life Support
(ATLS) program and the Golden Hour
This system prioritizes interventions so that life
threatening injuries are treated ﬁrst. This can be
remembered simply as ‘ABCDE’ and is summarized
in Figure 17.1. The golden hour is the ﬁrst hour after
injury and it is during this period a number of treatable complications of trauma manifest clinically.

Airway
Lack of oxygenated blood delivered to the brain and
other major organs causes rapid death in the injured
patient. A protected, unobstructed airway is a priority in order to avoid hypoxia. A patient’s airway can
be compromised with:
• A decreased level of consciousness (head injury,
hypoxia, hypovolaemia, drugs).
• Facial trauma.
• Neck trauma.
• Aspiration of vomit or teeth.
• Swelling of subcutaneous tissues associated
with burns or smoke inhalation.
Assessment of airway patency should be rapid (see
Fig. 17.2). All trauma patients should receive oxygen
initially.
C spine control
All trauma patients should be assumed to have
unstable neck injuries until proven otherwise, especially in those with an altered conscious level or
with injuries above the level of the clavicle. The
cervical spine can be immobilized manually or with
an appropriately sized hard collar, sandbags and
tape across the patient’s forehead.
Breathing
Adequate ventilation is required in order to oxygenate blood and therefore major organs such as
the brain. Causes of ventilatory compromise
include:
• Central nervous system depression (head injury,
alcohol, drugs, cervical spine injury).
• Tension pneumothorax (needs immediate
decompression before a chest X-ray!).
• Open pneumothorax.

• Rib fractures.
• Haemothorax.
• Flail chest.
Fig 17.2 shows some signs of airway and ventilatory
compromise.
Circulation
Shock is deﬁned as inadequate organ perfusion and
tissue oxygenation. The most common cause of this
in the trauma patient is hypovolaemia secondary to
haemorrhage.
It is important to recognize hypovolaemic shock
so that treatment is not delayed. The patient should
have capillary reﬁll, pulse rate, blood pressure,
urinary output and conscious level closely monitored. Clinical ﬁndings allow the doctor to estimate
the circulating blood volume (approximately 5 L in

128

adults). Blood pressure can be normal with up to
30% blood loss, but as the patient decompensates,
there is tachycardia, hypotension and confusion.
There are ﬁve areas to look at for potential blood
loss—chest, abdomen, pelvis, long bones . . . and
on the ﬂoor (e.g. arterial bleeding).
Conscious level
This is based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and
ranges from 3 to 15. This should be monitored regularly to observe for deterioration in the patient’s
condition. A simpler method to determine conscious level is AVPU (see Fig. 17.3).
Exposure and secondary survey
Look from head to toe for other injuries.
This includes log-rolling the patient (with C spine
control) to assess for trauma to the back and spine.

Investigations
A trauma series of X-rays (performed in the resuscitation area) should include at least chest and pelvis
ﬁlms, and if indicated C spine ﬁlms. Blood tests
include full blood count, urea and creatinine, clotting and blood should be grouped and saved in case
the patient needs a blood transfusion.

Treatment
Treat life threatening conditions ﬁrst, in the order of
ABCDE. It is then important to identify all other
injuries through the secondary survey so that they
can be managed by the relevant surgical
specialties.

OPEN FRACTURES

Deﬁnition
This is when there is an external wound leading to
the fracture site potentially allowing contamination
with bacteria (see Fig. 16.4).

17

Spinal injuries

Incidence
Approximately 23 per 100 000 patients per year.

Aetiology and pathology
Most open fractures are high energy injuries, and are
associated with signiﬁcant damage to soft tissues.
They can also occur when the fracture is grossly
angulated or displaced, and the sharp fracture end
exits through the skin. The greatest risk to the bone
is infection and the development of chronic
osteomyelitis.

Clinical features
Check ABCDE. Assess the fractured limb for deformity and neurovascular status. Any wound around
the fracture site should be assumed to communicate
with the bone. Also assess for evidence of compartment syndrome (still possible in open fractures).

Management
Photograph and then dress the wound with a betadine soaked swab. Splint the limb and start intravenous antibiotics as soon as possible. Give tetanus
prophylaxis if immunizations are not up to date.
The wound should be aggressively debrided in
theatre within 6 hours to avoid bacterial infection
of the fracture. The fracture can then be stabilized
with a suitable method of internal or external
ﬁxation.

SPINAL INJURIES

Deﬁnition
Includes fractures and subluxations/dislocations of
vertebrae. Also includes damage to the spinal cord
even in absence of a fracture.

ﬂexion and lumbar injuries which commonly occur
from falls from a height. Thoracolumbar injuries
classically occurred as a result of wearing a lap belt
in an RTA. In elderly patients with osteoporosis, low
energy trauma can result in simple wedge fractures
(Fig. 13.5).
The stability of the spine depends on the bony
structures and the integrity of strong ligaments. It
can be thought of as two columns (Fig. 17.4). Fractures involving one column only such as anterior
wedge fractures are stable (Fig. 13.5) and can be
treated conservatively. Fractures involving both
columns such as a high energy burst fracture (Fig.
17.5) are often unstable. Injuries may involve the
bony structures only, both ligaments and bones or
purely ligaments. This means even if the X-ray is
normal you cannot assume the spine is stable as all
the ligaments may be torn!

Incidence
Common injury in the trauma patient. 10–20% of
patients with a spinal fracture will have a second
spinal fracture at another level.

Aetiology and pathology
Most often occur after road trafﬁc accidents (RTA).
Other examples include neck injuries from diving
into a shallow pool, thoracic injuries from hyper-

Be careful with spinal injuries. It is very
distressing for the patient and staff if
fractures are missed. To exclude injury
you need good X-rays (and/or CT) and an awake
patient who has not just had morphine to allow
proper examination. If in doubt get senior help.

Trauma

Clinical features

Treatment

The conscious patient will complain of pain at the
level of injury (beware in patients with decreased
conscious level). Patients with facial or head injuries should be presumed to have a signiﬁcant neck
injury until proven otherwise.
Clinical examination may reveal tenderness, a
boggy swelling, bony step, or a gibbus. The patient
should be log-rolled with C spine control in order
to examine the thoracic and lumbar spine. Check
limbs for abnormal neurology. A full neurological
examination should include a rectal examination
for anal tone and sensation (sacral nerves). Knowledge of dermatomes and myotomes will guide
the doctor to the level of spinal cord injury if
present.
Remember that spinal injury may cause bradycardia and hypotension (spinal shock). These patients
should receive intravenous ﬂuids cautiously.

This depends on the stability of the fracture.
Stable fractures can be mobilized.
Unstable fractures require immobilization (e.g.
halo vest), bracing or possibly internal ﬁxation.

Prognosis
The patients with spinal cord damage have the worst
prognosis and often require extensive rehabilitation
on a spinal unit.

PELVIC FRACTURES
These are high energy injuries commonly associated
with massive bleeding, urethral, bladder and abdominal injuries.

Incidence
Diagnosis and investigation
Neck—AP, lateral (to at least T1) and odontoid peg
views.
Thoracic and lumbar spine AP and lateral views
if indicated.
X-rays can be normal, even with spinal cord
trauma.
Further imaging includes CT for fractures
and MRI to look for ligament and spinal cord
damage.

Rare injuries but careful assessment of the polytraumatized patient is necessary to avoid missing such
injuries. Most deaths in polytrauma patients occur
as a result of pelvic fractures.

Aetiology
The pelvis can be thought of as a stable ring formed
from the sacrum, ilium and pubis bones held
together by strong ligaments. The basic mechanisms
of injury are anteroposterior compression (blow
from the front; Fig. 17.6), lateral compression (side

Clinical features
The patient will have pain and may be shocked due
to blood loss.
Clinical examination may reveal blood at the urethral meatus (urethral tear) and bruising in the
scrotal region. Rectal examination may reveal blood
or a boggy, high riding prostate (urethral tear). Bone
fragments may be palpable. Do not assess pelvic
stability by bi-manual compression of the iliac
wings (‘springing’ the pelvis) as this may displace a
clot and cause re-bleeding.

Diagnosis and investigation
An AP X-ray of the pelvis should be checked for
fractures, symmetry and normal contours. Once
stable a CT scan more accurately deﬁnes the
fracture.

not respond are likely to have ongoing bleeding.
There is haemorrhage from bones, the pelvic venous
plexus and rarely, arteries.
Bleeding can be reduced by stabilizing the pelvis.
This can be done immediately by tying a bed sheet
around the pelvis to close the pelvic ring. Emergency
external ﬁxation can then be applied. If this fails,
angiography and embolization of bleeding vessels
is performed.
Stable fractures require pain relief and
mobilization.
Unstable fracture patterns require surgical
ﬁxation.

Prognosis
Mortality can be high, especially when the patient
has associated head, chest or abdominal injuries.
Complications such as urethral tears, sciatic nerve
damage or persistent sacroiliac pain can affect
quality of life in the long term.

Infection of bones
and joints

18

Objectives
You should be able to:
• List the common organisms associated with osteomyelitis.
• Know how osteomyelitis develops and understand the terms ‘sequestrum’ and
‘involucrum’.
• Recognize the clinical features of septic arthritis in children and adults.
• Describe the treatment and complications of septic arthritis.
• Know useful investigations for the diagnosis of bone and joint sepsis.
• Describe the features of tuberculosis and how these differ from other orthopaedic
infections.

Introduction

Aetiology and pathology

Bone and joint infection has become much less
common in western society over the last century.
This is explained by increasing use of antibiotics and
the general improvement in nutrition and health of
the population as a whole.
Infection does still occur and needs to be recognized and treated promptly to avoid potentially
serious complications.
In this chapter we will talk about osteomyelitis
(infection in bone) and septic arthritis (infection in
a joint).
Blood supply to bone is from the endosteum and
periosteum.

In children there is often a history of preceding
trauma, which may predispose the limb to infection. The most common infecting organism overall
is Staphylococcus aureus, but streptococcal (neonates
particularly) and Gram-negative infections can also
occur. If unusual organisms are present, consider
speciﬁc predisposing factors as listed in Figure 18.2,
for example patients with AIDS can get fungal
infections.
The three most common causes of osteomyelitis
are:

OSTEOMYELITIS
Infection of bone can be caused by direct
inoculation (exogenous) or blood-borne bacteria
(haematogenous).
In childhood or adolescence osteomyelitis is
usually caused by haematogenous spread of bacteria. In adults the source is more likely to be exogenous, most commonly due to infection developing
after surgery or after injury (particularly in the case
of an open fracture).

Incidence
Osteomyelitis is now uncommon.

• Post-trauma osteomyelitis.
• Post-surgery osteomyelitis.
• Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis.

Post-trauma osteomyelitis
An open fracture means the skin is broken allowing
bacteria direct access to the bony surfaces. Large
dirty wounds associated with high-energy injuries
are more likely to result in post-trauma osteomyelitis. Urgent surgical debridement and lavage are
required in order to remove contaminated material
and dead bone. Inadequate or delayed surgery often
leads to osteomyelitis due to bacteria being harboured within dead bone. In these circumstances
the fracture will often fail to heal.

Post-surgery osteomyelitis
Many surgical procedures in orthopaedics involve
using implants such as hip replacements or plates

133

Infection of bones and joints
Fig. 18.1 Sequence of events in
osteomyelitis. The primary focus
of infection (A) has spread
through bone, causing the death
of cortical bone and formation of
a subperiosteal abscess (B).
Infection can spread into the joint
(C) causing septic arthritis. Death
of a segment of bone
(sequestrum) occurs (D), and the
area is surrounded by new
subperiosteal bone (involucrum).

and screws. These ‘foreign bodies’ can harbour infection if at the time of surgery bacteria are introduced.
For this reason orthopaedic surgeons are strict about
aseptic techniques in the operating theatre and use
antibiotics as prophylaxis. Despite this, infection
does still occur and may spread around the implant,
devitalizing bone.

Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis
This form of osteomyelitis is usually seen in children and may develop spontaneously.
The pathogenesis of acute haematogenous osteomyelitis is as follows (Fig. 18.1):
1. Trauma to affected limb.
2. A bacteraemia that settles in the metaphysis of
a long bone.
3. The metaphysis has a good blood supply but
is thought to have very few phagocytic cells
capable of ﬁghting infection, therefore
allowing the infection to develop.
4. Inﬂammation and pus formation within the
bone.
5. Pus escapes through small holes in bone
(harversian canals) to form a subperiosteal
abscess.

134

D

6. Pus is now present on both sides of the bone,
causing this part of the bone to die.
7. Dead bone, now called the sequestrum,
harbours infection.
8. Periosteal new bone called involucrum forms
as the body tries to ﬁght the infection.
9. In older children the physis (growth plate)
acts as a barrier, preventing further spread of
infection.
10. In neonates and infants spread can occur
across the physis via the epiphyseal artery.
11. In some joints the capsule extends down to
the metaphysis. If pus escapes here, then septic
arthritis will result.
Acute osteomyelitis can easily become chronic if the
sequestrum is neglected or not completely excised
at surgery.

Other conditions associated
with osteomyelitis
The above three causes of osteomyelitis are the most
common but it also occurs in the other conditions
listed in Figure 18.2.
Sadly we are now seeing more and more cases of
bone and joint infection in intravenous drug users.

HIV/AIDS

Fig. 18.2 Conditions associated with osteomyelitis.

When you consider that these patients are often
malnourished, immunosuppressed (possibly HIV
positive), frequently inject themselves deeply with
dirty needles and often neglect small abscesses it is
not difﬁcult to understand why.

Clinical features
Acute osteomyelitis causes pain, fever and loss
of funtion (often a limp if the lower limb is
involved).
It is more common in the tibia and femur. The
limb will be tender to palpate, erythematous and
possibly swollen.
At the extremes of age (neonate, infant or elderly)
the symptoms and signs are often non-speciﬁc (such
as general malaise). These patients can be seriously
ill and it can be extremely difﬁcult to pinpoint the
exact site of the problem.
Occasionally a patient presents with multiple
sites affected or there may be another focus of infection which has then spread from or to bone, for
example infective endocarditis. This is called seeding
of infection.
In post-surgery and post-trauma osteomyelitis
the wound will be painful, red and inﬂamed.
Normally, once postoperative pain has settled,
patients are comfortable and can mobilize without
pain. If pain persists or increases, infection is a
possible cause. Eventually wounds will break
down and discharge. If left untreated a sinus will
result.
A limb with chronic osteomyelitis will be swollen
and have thickened ‘woody’ skin. Here the focus of
infection remains within the bone as a sequestrum
and the infection remains quiet for a period of time
(can be many years) and then ﬂares up unexpectedly, often producing an abscess. A chronic discharging sinus can result.

Fig. 18.3 Brodie’s abscess.

Diagnosis and investigation
The diagnosis may be obvious on clinical features,
particularly if the history reveals a clear predisposing
factor.
A raised white cell count (WCC), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein
(CRP) will be present on blood tests.
Initially X-rays will be normal, but after 10 days,
features of lysis, periosteal elevation and new bone
formation are seen. Later the sequestrum may be
seen as a sclerotic area. A Brodie’s abscess may be
seen in the distal femur (Fig. 18.3).
Early osteomyelitis can be detected before X-ray
changes, using bone scanning (shows increased
uptake) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
It is very important to send microbiology specimens such as blood cultures prior to starting
antibiotics.

Management
Conservative
The patient needs adequate analgesia, splintage of
the affected limb and appropriate antibiotics. Consultation with the microbiologist is advisable.

135

Infection of bones and joints
As the majority of infections are with Staph. aureus,
ﬂucloxacillin and fusidic acid are usually the ﬁrst-line
antibiotics, given initially intravenously for 6 weeks.
Antibiotic-resistant strains such as MRSA are
becoming more prevalent and if suspected then vancomycin is usually the antibiotic of choice (consult
a microbiologist).
Provided the patient does not have an abscess or
dead bone present, then antibiotics will sufﬁce.

Surgical
If an abscess is present this should be drained surgically. Dead bone, the sequestrum, needs to be
removed.
In a chronic case if the patient and surgeon decide
to attempt to cure the infection, extensive surgery is
required to remove the implant and all infected
bone. Techniques for doing this vary depending on
the extent of involvement and the site.
It is possible to simply treat the ‘ﬂare-ups’ and suppress the infection with antibiotics when required.

Complications
Complications occur if:
• Osteomyelitis persists.
• The physis is damaged, leading to growth
disturbance and deformity.
• The infection spreads to the joint, causing septic
arthritis.

Prognosis
For acute osteomyelitis the outcome is good and the
majority make a full recovery provided none of the
above complications occur. In chronic cases following surgery or trauma many surgical procedures are
often required and amputation is not an uncommon outcome.

Chronic osteomyelitis is very
difﬁcult to treat. It may
remain dormant for many
years and then ﬂare up
intermittently causing pain and loss of function.
These ﬂare-ups are often managed simply with
antibiotics. Some people cannot tolerate long-term
loss of function of the limb in which case
amputation may be indicated.

136

SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Septic arthritis is infection within a synovial joint.

Incidence
The condition is uncommon, but is seen more often
in children, young adults and the elderly. It is more
common in the developing world and in patients
with a predisposing factor. In children, it is less
common than osteomyelitis.

Aetiology and pathology
Infection reaches a joint via the haematogenous
route, direct spread from the metaphysis or penetrating trauma/surgery. Associated conditions are
similar to those for acute osteomyelitis (see Fig.
18.2) with the addition of rheumatoid arthritis and
crystal arthropathy.
Certain organisms are more common at different
ages. Haemophilus inﬂuenzae used to be the most
common infecting organism in infants prior to the
introduction of the vaccination programme. In
young sexually active adults the most likely infecting
organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
In haematogenous septic arthritis the bacterium
settles in the synovium, which may be inﬂamed due
to trauma or disease. Proliferation of bacteria causes
an inﬂammatory response by the host with numerous leucocytes migrating into the joint. The variety
of enzymes and breakdown products produced
damages the delicate articular cartilage very quickly
(within hours) and if left unchecked permanent
damage will ensue (Fig. 18.4).

Clinical features
The patient will have an acutely hot swollen joint
with a fever and be systemically unwell. An infant
or young child will be distressed, unwell and difﬁcult to assess. There may be a history of recent infection such as otitis media.
Septic arthritis is more common in the hip and
knee but can present in the shoulder, elbow and
wrist.
Any movement at all causes intense pain, and
weight bearing will not be tolerated. If the joint is
superﬁcial an effusion is palpable.
In neonates and infants the diagnosis may be
less obvious, particularly if the joint is deeply

• If available, ultrasound scanning is useful to see
if there is a joint effusion where the hip is the

situated such as the hip. These patients may be
seriously ill.

If treated promptly, prognosis is good, but if joint
destruction occurs it is very poor.

TUBERCULOSIS

Incidence
Patients with an infected joint will not
let you put the joint through a passive
range of movement. It is too painful!

Diagnosis and investigation
• WCC, CRP and ESR will be raised.
• X-rays will be normal initially and show joint
destruction late.

Tuberculosis (TB) is common in global terms and
causes signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality in Africa
and Asia.
TB is making a ‘comeback’ in the UK with over
10 000 cases per year, most of which are in the Asian
community.

Aetiology and pathology
TB is due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis infection.

137

Infection of bones and joints
Histologically the classical appearance is of
caseating necrosis.
Musculoskeletal tuberculosis results when
primary TB (lung) becomes widespread or when
later reactivation or reinfection occurs (immunosuppressed patients).

Clinical features
Patients have general symptoms of ill-health such as
malaise, weight loss, cough and loss of appetite. The
most common musculoskeletal sites affected by TB
are the spine, hip and knee.
Unlike other orthopaedic infections, TB presents
with gradual symptoms of pain and may be initially
diagnosed as osteoarthritis or inﬂammatory
arthritis.

Diagnosis and investigation
The two commonest tests are the Mantoux and Heaf
tests, which are skin hypersensitivity tests.
For conﬁrmation, large samples of bone or synovial ﬂuid are required which need to be cultured for
a prolonged period (6 weeks).

138

If mycobacterial infection is suspected, samples
should be submitted to a Ziehl–Neelsen stain and
the mycobacteria appear as red acid–alcohol-fast
organisms.
X-rays show variable amounts of joint destruction with periarticular osteopenia.
In the spine, vertebra plana may be found with
almost complete collapse of the vertebral body
(see Fig 23.9).

Treatment
Drugs commonly used are rifampicin, isoniazid and
ethambutol.
A spinal abscess may need drainage with stabilization of the spine.
Ankylosed joints from old treated TB can be
replaced (usually the hip).

Fibromyalgia

19

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Recognize the common symptoms of ﬁbromyalgia.
• Understand the strategies employed in the management of patients with
ﬁbromyalgia.

Deﬁnition
Rheumatologists meet many patients suffering from
chronic widespread pain that cannot be explained
by an inﬂammatory or articular problem. There are
often associated symptoms such as depression,
fatigue and sleep disturbance. Fibromyalgia is a
diagnosis used to describe this collection of clinical
features, particularly when they are accompanied by
the ﬁnding of soft tissue tenderness on examination.
However, the existence of ﬁbromyalgia as a disease
is a matter of debate. Many physicians recognize the
clinical features above, but feel that giving patients
a label may reinforce their illness behaviour.

Prevalence
Fibromyalgia is common. The prevalence is estimated to be between 2 and 5%.

Aetiology
The aetiology of ﬁbromyalgia is unknown, but
several risk factors for the condition are recognized.
These include:
• Female sex.
• Middle age.
• Stress.
There is some overlap between the features of ﬁbromyalgia and other syndromes that have a functional
component (Fig. 19.1).

Pathogenesis
The roles of various neurotransmitters, hormones
and peptides have been examined in ﬁbromyalgia;

in spite of much research, the pathogenesis has not
been explained.

Clinical features
Fibromyalgia predominantly affects women between
the ages of 30 and 60 years. Patients usually report
a long history of widespread pain which responds
poorly to analgesia. Other common symptoms are
shown in Figure 19.2.
Fatigue is often severe and follows minimal exertion. Sleep disruption is common and patients frequently complain that they wake feeling unrefreshed.
Psychiatric problems, such as anxiety and depression, are thought to affect as many as 20% of ﬁbromyalgia sufferers.
The only signiﬁcant ﬁnding on musculoskeletal
examination is the presence of soft tissue tenderness, usually at multiple sites. Common sites of tenderness are shown in Figure 19.3.

Investigations
Fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis based on recognition of symptoms and tender points. The only role
of investigations is in the exclusion of other conditions. Certain diseases can mimic ﬁbromyalgia,
including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
hypothyroidism, osteomalacia and polymyalgia
rheumatica.

Management
There is no speciﬁc treatment for ﬁbromyalgia.
Quality of life for most patients remains poor. The
following treatment strategies may help.

139

Fibromyalgia

Education
• Informs patients about the condition.

Physiotherapy
A graded aerobic exercise regime can improve ﬁtness
and reduce pain and fatigue.

It is important to give patients
with ﬁbromyalgia information
about the condition when you
make the diagnosis. Many
patients are told that the news is good, they don’t
have arthritis and can ‘get on with their lives’. They
often leave clinic thinking that the doctor hasn’t
taken them seriously and thinks the pain is ‘in their
head’. It is helpful to explain that the pain is real,
but is arising from the tendons, ligaments and
muscles rather than the joints. Although certain
activities will be painful, gentle exercise will not
harm them and, if continued, can lead to an
improvement in symptoms.

Surgical principles in the
treatment of bone and
joint disease

20

Objectives
You should be able to:
•
•
•
•

Describe how to reduce the risk of infection in orthopaedics.
Understand the basic priciples of joint surgery for osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis.
Understand the term ‘osteotomy’ and give an example of its use.
Understand what is meant by arthroscopy and on which joints this is most commonly
performed.
• Understand the term arthroplasty and know the main indication for this type of
surgery.
• Describe which joints are commonly fused and why.

Orthopaedic operations are very common and this
chapter outlines the principles of surgery.

STERILITY
Infection is the major concern in elective orthopaedic surgery. Deep infection in joint replacement
surgery is disastrous when it occurs as simple measures such as antibiotics and abscess drainage will
not eradicate the infection. The patient may be
worse off than before surgery and require lengthy
hospital stays with extensive further surgery and signiﬁcant risks.
The risk of infection is minimized by the following preoperative, perioperative and postoperative
factors.

Preoperative factors
• Cleaning the skin.
• Avoidance of concurrent infection (e.g. urinary
tract infection).
• Preoperative antibiotics on induction of
anaesthesia.
• A healthy, well-nourished patient.

Perioperative factors
• Clean laminar airﬂow theatre (air is specially
ﬁltered).
• Adequate skin preparation and impervious
exclusion drapes.

• Exhaust suits (enclosed clothing with air
evacuation to prevent skin contaminants falling
onto the wound).
• Sterile instruments and prostheses.
• Careful surgical technique (including
haemostasis).
• The use of antibiotic loaded cement in joint
arthroplasty

Postoperative factors
• Wound dressing.
• Prophylactic antibiotics for possible
bacteraemia (e.g. during catheterization).
• Postoperative antibiotics.

OPERATIONS
There are several things a surgeon can do for a
painful joint.

Joint debridement
A diseased joint can be debrided surgically in an
attempt to improve range of movement or to reduce
symptoms such as pain and swelling.
Debridement means removing diseased tissue.
Osteophytes are often removed in osteoarthritis but
debriding a joint does not cure or stop the progression of the disease process.
Examples of joints where debridement is performed include the ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal (MTP)
joint in hallux rigidus. See Figure 20.1.

may still be painful.

Joint arthrodesis
Fig. 20.1 Joint debridement.

Arthroscopy
‘Keyhole surgery’ techniques have become routine
in recent years.
In the past, arthroscopy was seen as a diagnostic
procedure but now a number of operations are possible by purely arthroscopic means. Examples are
stabilization or rotator cuff repair in the shoulder,
and meniscal repair or anterior cruciate ligament
reconstruction in the knee.
It is now commonplace for many joints to be
arthroscoped, including the shoulder, ankle, hip
and wrist.

Joint excision (excision
arthroplasty)
This operation has been mostly superseded by joint
replacement. It is still occasionally performed for
severe arthritis of the ﬁrst MTP joint (Keller’s procedure) and also in the hip (Girdlestone’s procedure)
if the patient has had an infected joint. See Figure
20.2.

144

Arthrodesis or fusion is performed to make the
bones ‘heal’ together across a joint. Movement is
obviously lost but if the fusion is sound then the
joint will be pain-free.
Bones are most commonly fused around the foot
and ankle or hand and wrist, usually in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis. Examples include ankle
fusion, subtalar fusion and wrist fusion.
Fusion can be achieved by different means, such
as:
• Internal ﬁxation (screws, staples, plates) (Fig.
20.3, top).
• Intramedullary nail (Fig. 20.3, bottom).
• External ﬁxation.
A bone graft may be used.

Joint arthroplasty
Almost any joint can now be replaced. The primary
reason to replace a joint is pain.
The advantage of replacement over fusion is that
movement is maintained and therefore function can
return to near normality.
Implants are usually a combination of a metal
and high-density polyethylene bearing to keep
frictional forces to a minimum. The joint surfaces
are also highly polished for low friction.

145

Surgical principles in the treatment of bone and joint disease
The most common reasons for failure of an
implant are loosening, infection and fracture (Fig.
20.6).

Osteotomy/deformity correction
An osteotomy is an operation to break a bone and
realign the joint or deformity.
As described in Chapter 9, the most common
place for this to occur is at the knee to ofﬂoad the
medial compartment, which may be arthritic.
Deformity can occur for other reasons (see Ch. 5)
and correction of such deformity is an important
part of orthopaedic surgery. The two most common
reasons for deformity needing correction are malunion of fractures (tibia and femur) and congenital
deformity (e.g. clubfoot). This is an expanding area
of orthopaedics with a lot of interest in correction
of complex multiple deformities.
It is also possible to lengthen bones gradually
with external ﬁxation usually in the form of circular
frames with a variety of hinges and movable rods.
See Figure 20.7.

Synovectomy
The aim of this operation is to remove the synovial
lining of the diseased joint or the tenosynovium
around tendons. The procedure needs to be performed early and has three possible beneﬁcial
effects:
1. Reduction of swelling.
2. Slowing of disease progression.
3. Prevention of tendon rupture.
Unfortunately it is impossible to remove the whole
synovium with synovectomy, and symptoms often
return. This procedure is usually performed around
the wrist.
Operations commonly performed on rheumatoid patients are shown in Figure 20.8.

Pre- and postoperative care

21

Objectives
You should be able to:
• List ways to prevent complications from orthopaedic surgery.
• Understand the purpose of preoperative assessment and think of examples of
important conditions that may be discovered at this stage.
• Classify complications of surgery.
• List the local and general complications of surgery.
• Outline basic postoperative care.
• Treat low blood pressure and low urine output postoperatively.
• Deﬁne shock and know the ﬁve major causes.

Orthopaedics is a surgical speciality and one of the
tasks of a junior doctor is to assess patients prior to
surgery and look after them postoperatively.
Any surgical procedure has risks and complications, and knowledge of these helps minimize and
prevent them.
Patients now need to be made aware of these
important complications before informed consent
is obtained.
Complications are divided into:
• Local (speciﬁc to that operation), and
• General (common to any operation).
We further subdivide complication on the basis of
the time that has elapsed after surgery, into:
• Immediate (within 24 hours).
• Early (days/weeks).
• Late (months/years).

PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT
Complications can be minimized by careful preoperative preparation. Any concurrent medical problems need to be stabilized and new conditions
identiﬁed, investigated and treated appropriately.
Elective patients are seen a few weeks before
surgery in the preoperative assessment clinic. The
following should be recorded.

General
• Observations (BP, pulse, temperature): the
patient may have undiagnosed atrial ﬁbrillation
(AF) or hypertension.
• History including past medical history and drug
history: the patient may be on warfarin and will
need this to be stopped prior to surgery and
may need admission for intravenous heparin.
• Detailed systemic enquiry: the patient may have
shortness of breath on exertion and chest pain
(angina). Such a patient following investigation
may even go on to have coronary bypass
surgery prior to the orthopaedic operation.
• Examination: e.g. the patient may have a heart
murmur.
• Blood tests (unnecessary in young, ﬁt patients
for simple surgery): full blood count (FBC),
glucose, urea and electrolytes (U&E), liver
function tests (LFTs) and clotting screen. Sickle
cell test for patients of Afro-Caribbean origin.
Arterial blood gases may be required if the
patient has chest disease.
• Blood can be grouped and saved and crossmatched if signiﬁcant blood loss is expected.
• Urinalysis for diabetes mellitus or urinary tract
infection (UTI). If a patient has an UTI, it
should be treated prior to any orthopaedic
operation.
• Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray (if
indicated).

149

Pre- and postoperative care
• Further investigations should be ordered if
required, e.g. cardiac echo in aortic stenosis.

Check sensation, perfusion, pulses and function
of digits distal to the operative ﬁeld.
After major surgery requiring an inpatient stay,
patients will need:
• FBC and U&E checked the day after surgery.
• X-rays of the joint operated upon.

Informed consent should be taken by a
surgeon capable of performing the
operation so that particular risks and
expectations can be explained to the patient. This
means the pre-registration House Ofﬁcer is not the
best person for the job!

Local
The patient should be asked if the limb is still
painful because the surgery may be unnecessary.
The limb is examined.
Note skin condition (there may be a rash or skin
breakdown over the operation site), pulses, range of
movement and look for any distal infection. For
example, a knee replacement procedure should not
be carried out in a patient with an infected ingrowing toenail.

IMMEDIATE PREOPERATIVE CARE
Additional monitoring such as an arterial line and
central venous line can be inserted in the anaesthetic
room for patients expected to have a complicated
anaesthetic.
A urinary catheter is important to assess ﬂuid
balance in patients who may lose signiﬁcant
amounts of blood.
Intravenous antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis are also given if necessary.

BASIC POSTOPERATIVE CARE

General
Patients are taken to recovery until fully awake, then
transferred to a high-dependency unit (HDU) or the
ward.
Regular recordings are made of BP, pulse and
oxygen saturation.
Adequate pain relief is very important.

150

Once patients are well, every effort is made to mobilize them and encourage early safe discharge. DVT
prophylaxis is continued until patients are mobile.
A multidisciplinary approach is needed to achieve
this, with physiotherapy, occupational therapy,
social workers, nursing staff and sometimes physicians having input.
Home modiﬁcations are required for patients
having a joint arthroplasty.

Local
Elevation in a Bradford sling (for an arm) or on a
Braun’s frame (Fig. 21.1) is very important to reduce
swelling.
Distal neurovascular observations are performed
to check the perfusion and function of the limb
distal to the operation.
As soon as possible, physiotherapy is encouraged,
to mobilize the limb.

COMPLICATIONS

General
Respiratory
Chest infections
Complications affecting the respiratory system are
very common postoperatively.
A chest infection typically presents early with
fever and shortness of breath. Elderly patients may
be confused.
There may be signs of consolidation on examination and a low Po2.
Treatment is with physiotherapy, nebulizers and
antibiotics.
Pulmonary embolus
Immobile orthopaedic patients with traumatized
limbs are very susceptible to deep vein thrombosis.
Risk is reduced by mechanical (foot pumps, graduated compression stockings) and chemical agents
(heparin, clexane, aspirin, warfarin) and early
mobilization.

Complications

21

It is important not to give too much ﬂuid, particularly to elderly patients with little physiological
reserve.
These patients present with shortness of breath,
and signs include a raised jugular venous pressure
(JVP) and bibasal crackles. Simple measures such as
sitting the patient up and giving oxygen can dramatically improve the patient’s condition. Further
treatment includes diuretics and nitrates.

Blood loss and blood transfusion

Fig. 21.1 Braun’s frame used to elevate a lower limb.

If the clot propagates and then breaks off it travels
to the lungs (a pulmonary embolus), which can be
fatal. The patient becomes acutely short of breath
and has pleuritic chest pain with signs of tachycardia, tachypnoea and a low PO2. An ECG may show
a sinus tachycardia, arrythmias or the classical but
rare S1Q3T3.
Treatment should be started immediately in the
form of low molecular weight subcutanous heparin
if suspected and diagnosis is proven with a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)

Cardiac
Myocardial infarction (MI)
MI is a relatively common postoperative complication, particularly in the elderly or those with preexisting heart disease. Patients do not always have
typical central crushing chest pain radiating to the
left arm associated with sweating and nausea and
the cardiac event may be silent or occur during
anaesthesia. This should be suspected in any patient
with unexplained hypotension.
Diagnosis is made based on raised troponin
cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms (ECGs).
Treatment includes oxygen and aspirin. Further
agents may be used based on an opinion from the
physicians (it is usually impossible to give thrombolytic drugs to postoperative patients owing to the
risk of bleeding).
Left ventricular failure
This can result from a cardiac event or from aggressive ﬂuid management over the perioperative period.

Most patients do not require a blood transfusion postoperatively, even after a total hip or
knee replacement. Blood transfusions are expensive (£400 per unit) and are associated with
transfusion reactions, transmission of infections
(hepatitis, HIV, vCJD) and immunosuppression.
Therefore blood should be prescribed sparingly.
Most patients can tolerate a Hb of 8 g/dL
even if they have pre-existing ischaemic heart
disease.

Gastrointestinal
Bleeding
The most important complication of the gastrointestinal (GI) system is bleeding, and the most
common reason for this on the orthopaedic wards
is non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID)
therapy.
Patients with haematemesis or melaena have a
suspected upper GI bleed until proven otherwise.
Diagnosis is conﬁrmed with upper GI endoscopies
performed as soon as possible. Supportive measures
including starting a proton pump inhibitor (PPI),
cross-matching of blood, ﬂuid resuscitation, careful
observations and oxygen are required.
Referral to a gastroenterologist or surgeon is
needed.
Paralytic ileus
This is a less serious complication presenting with
abdominal distension and nausea. Operations or
trauma to the spine predispose to ileus, which
usually spontaneously corrects after a few days on
intravenous ﬂuids and a nasogastric tube.

Renal
Renal failure
Pre-existing renal impairment is common in orthopaedic patients and the additional insult of a

151

Pre- and postoperative care
fracture or surgery with the associated blood loss
can tip the balance, causing renal failure.
Factors inﬂuencing the development of renal
failure include drugs (diuretics, NSAIDs) and hypovolaemia. It is very important to keep patients well
hydrated with enough ﬂuid to prevent prerenal
failure.
Careful monitoring of ﬂuid input with hourly
urine output and daily urea and electrolyte measurement are important when assessing such a
patient.

Low urinary output postoperatively is
almost always due to hypovolaemia and
patients require ﬂuid. It is very important
to carefully assess ﬂuid balance, so that diuretics are
not given to such patients just to increase the
output. This may precipitate renal failure!

Urinary tract infection
Urinary tract infections postoperatively are very
common. Diagnosis is made on urinalysis and a
midstream urine (MSU) sample is sent to microbiology. Antibiotics are started until culture and sensitivity results are known.

Local
Figure 21.2 lists local complications, their timing,
causes, signs and symptoms, and management.

SHOCK
Shock is deﬁned as an inability to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
Every doctor should be able to recognize shock.
On the orthopaedic wards the most likely causes
are hypovolaemic, septic and cardiogenic shock,
although neurogenic shock can occur after spinal
cord injury. Anaphylactic shock is less common,
but possible if patients are allergic to drugs or
latex.

152

Hypovolaemic
Haemorrhage is the most likely cause of hypovolaemic shock, which is due to inadequate circulatory volume. These patients require intravenous
ﬂuids and sometimes blood to restore blood
pressure.

Cardiogenic
The heart is unable to maintain adequate cardiac
output, usually because of infarction. Intravenous
ﬂuids may further overload the heart and positive inotropes such as noradrenaline may be
required.

Neurogenic/spinal
This is due to peripheral vasodilatation secondary
to spinal cord injury.
It is important not to overload such a patient
with ﬂuid in an attempt to raise the blood pressure (the BP remains low because of loss of
peripheral resistance). A sytolic blood pressure of
100 mmMg is normally acceptable in these
patients.

Septic
Peripheral vasodilatation is due to bacterial endotoxins in severe infection.

Anaphylactic shock
This occurs in patients already sensitized to an
allergen. There is an aggressive immune response
resulting in massive histamine release from basophils. The patient may rapidly deteriorate, and
develop a generalized urticaria, with stridor (upper
airway narrowing), wheeze and shortness of
breath. There is massive vasodilatation and a
tachycardia associated with hypotension. Treatment should be rapid including emergency airway
procedures, oxygen, nebulizers, intravenous hydrocortisone, antihistamines (chlorphenamine) and
intramuscular or intravenous adrenaline and ﬂuid
resuscitation.

Treatment
Basic treatment of shock should be instituted
immediately and includes oxygen therapy and

• Give a prognosis for individual malignant tumours.

This chapter concerns bone tumours (primary and
secondary) and other malignant conditions presenting as a musculoskeletal disorder.
You will notice that we have listed secondary
bone tumours before primary. This is because metastatic disease of bone is far more common than
primary malignancy.
• Secondary bone tumours—metastasis from:
—Lung
—Breast
—Prostate
—Kidney
—Thyroid
—Bowel.
• Primary bone tumours:
—Osteosarcoma
—Ewing’s sarcoma
—Chondrosarcoma.
• Soft tissue sarcomas.
• Haemopoietic diseases:
—Myeloma
—Leukaemia
—Lymphoma.

SECONDARY BONE TUMOURS

Incidence
Secondary bone tumours are the most common
bone-destroying lesions in the older patient.

Aetiology and pathology
The tumours most likely to metastasize to bone are
listed above. Metastatic lesions are most commonly
found in the spine, pelvis, ribs and proximal long
bones.
The mechanism of metastasis is shown in Figure
22.1.
Bone is destroyed by metastatic disease and weakened, predisposing to fracture. The majority of
metastases appear osteolytic but those from prostate
cancer appear sclerotic.

Clinical features
Patient with a known primary
The patient has a clear history of previous malignancy, which in the case of breast carcinoma may
have been many years previously. Unrelenting bone
pain in the axial skeleton then makes the patient
seek medical help. Night pain is often a feature that
does not respond to simple analgesia. There may be
constitutional symptoms such as weight loss and
malaise.

Patient with no known primary
The patient presents with bone pain as described
above but with no history of previous malignancy.
In this case it is important to ask about symptoms
suggestive of malignancy such as cough and haemoptysis (lung), urinary symptoms (prostate) or

Patients with maligancy can present ‘off their legs’
with weakness and a demonstrable spinal level
(change in sensation corresponding to the vertebral
level affected). There may be a history of preceding
spinal bony pain and then weakness, numbness
and then loss of bladder and bowel control. Urgent
radiotherapy may shrink the tumour and preserve
spinal cord function.

It can be a very difﬁcult decision
whether or not to operate on a patient
with spinal cord compression in the
presence of malignancy. There are signiﬁcant risks of
surgery but most spinal surgeons will try to stabilize
the spine if at all possible to preserve the patient’s
mobility and dignity. The patient will know they are
terminally ill but will not want to spend the last few
months of life immobile and incontinent.

change in bowel habit (bowel). Patients often do
not have any symptoms of the primary. Clinical
examination should concentrate on likely sources of
primary tumours; therefore examine:
•
•
•
•
•

Breast.
Chest.
Prostate (per rectum).
Thyroid.
Abdomen (kidney and bowel).

Fracture
Usually the patient has a history of bone pain preceding the event (usually minor trauma) that caused
the fracture. The patient is then either admitted or
seen in a fracture clinic.

Patients who present with signiﬁcant
fractures after a very minor injury (e.g.
after lifting a suitcase) may have a
malignancy.

156

Spinal bony pain in patients with known
metastatic disease needs investigation
and treatment before spinal cord
compression results.

Diagnosis and investigation
Any bone-destroying lesion could be due to infection or malignancy. Therefore:
• Check the white cell count (WCC) and
inﬂammatory markers—C-reactive protein
(CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR). These are raised in infection but may
also be raised in malignancy (myeloma).
• Further blood tests may identify the primary
such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or
prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA).
• Plain X-rays will usually show an osteolytic
lesion; however, signiﬁcant bone loss (> 50%) is
needed before it is apparent on X-ray
examination.
• If strong clinical suspicion exists then an MRI
scan is more sensitive.

Primary bone tumours
• Cortical thinning suggests impending fracture.
• A bone scan will be hot and is useful to exclude
further lesions.
• In an unknown primary, further investigation to
ﬁnd the primary is warranted (see Algorithm for
the investigation of sinister back pain, Fig. 1.5).

Treatment
Treatment depends on the primary and on the life
expectancy of the patient. A multidisciplinary
approach is required involving oncologists.

Conservative
• Adequate analgesia and splintage.
• Radiotherapy is used frequently for bony
metastatic pain.
• Chemotherapy may have a role in certain
tumours.
• Hormonal therapy is useful in breast disease.
• Intravenous bisphosphonates are now being
used to inhibit osteoclastic resorption of
bone.

Surgical
• Intramedullary ﬁxation of long bones is
performed for fracture or impending fracture.
• Joint arthroplasty is sometimes used around the
hip and shoulder.
• Spinal decompression and stabilization for
acute cord compression.

Enchondroma
An enchondroma is a benign bone lesion of cartilaginous origin.
Incidence
They are quite common, occurring usually in
adulthood.
Aetiology and pathology
Enchondromas develop from aberrant cartilage
(‘chondroma’) left within bone (‘en’). They are
usually found in the metaphysis of long bones
(femur or humerus) but are also common in the
hand. See Figure 22.2.
Clinical features
An enchondroma is usually asymptomatic and may
be found incidentally. Large lesions causing cortical
erosion can be painful and the patient may notice a
swelling, particularly in the hand.
Diagnosis and investigation
Typical features on X-ray show a well-demarcated
calcifying lesion in the metaphysis of the bone.
Serial X-rays may be obtained to make sure the
lesion is not growing rapidly.

Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the primary.

Patients with renal tumours and a
solitary metastasis may be cured by
resection of both.

PRIMARY BONE TUMOURS
Enchondroma

Primary tumours of bone can be benign or
malignant.

Bone tumours/malignancy
Treatment
Usually no treatment is required, but if the lesion is
signiﬁcantly painful or associated with fracture, excision or curettage may be performed.

Osteochondroma
Incidence
This is the most common benign bone lesion, presenting from childhood through to adult life.
Aetiology and pathology
The lesion develops from aberrant cartilage remaining on the surface of the cortex. It is usually found
around the knee, most commonly on the distal
femur.
The pathological appearance is of a bone
lesion continuous with the cortex of the bone,
capped with hyaline cartilage. It can be sessile
or pedunculated.

Clinical features
Patients have intense pain, particularly at night.
Tenderness over the lesion is usual. In the spine a
scoliosis may be present.
Diagnosis and investigation
X-ray features show a radiolucent nidus surrounded
by a dense area of reactive bone.
CT scans conﬁrm and accurately locate the lesion
(Fig. 22.3).
Treatment
Pain is typically relieved by aspirin.
CT-guided ablation is now preferred over surgical
excision.
Prognosis
The tumour is eventually self-limiting.

Fibrous dysplasia
This is not strictly speaking a bone tumour.

Clinical features
The majority are asymptomatic, presenting incidentally or as a swelling. Rarely, pain or pressure effects
on nerves or vessels occur.
Diagnosis and investigation
The typical appearance of a pedunculated lesion in
continuity with the cortex clinches the diagnosis. If
there is doubt, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reassure.

Incidence
Fibrous dysplasia is relatively common, usually presenting in the ﬁrst three decades.
Aetiology and pathology
It is most commonly found in the tibia, femur
and ribs, and is caused by developmental
abnormality of bone with numerous ﬁbrous
proliferations.

Treatment
Usually no treatment is needed; rarely, excision is
carried out, if symptomatic.
Prognosis
It is extremely rare for either osteochondroma or
enchondroma to undergo malignant change.

Osteoid osteoma
Osteoid osteoma is a painful self-limiting benign
bone lesion.
Incidence
The lesion is uncommon, usually presenting between
5 and 30 years of age.
Aetiology and pathology
It is caused by a nidus of osteoblasts located in the
cortex of bone, and is usually found in the tibia,
spine or femur.

158

Primary bone tumours

22

Clinical features
The condition is usually asymptomatic, discovered
as an incidental ﬁnding, but can present with pain,
swelling, deformity or fracture.
Diagnosis and investigation
A typical ground glass appearance is diagnostic.
Treatment
No treatment is usually required, but if signiﬁcant,
curettage and bone grafting can be performed.

Malignant primary bone tumours
Primary malignant bone tumours are very rare
indeed. We will discuss two of those most likely to
be encountered.

Osteosarcoma
Incidence
There are approximately 1–2 cases per million of
population. Presentation is in adolescence and
young adulthood or in the elderly where they
develop in Pagetic bones.
Aetiology and pathology
Paget’s disease or radiation can predispose, but
most cases occur sporadically. The tumour is highly
malignant and secretes osteoid. Local spread occurs
quickly, destroying the cortex, but it may also
metastasize.
The most common location is around the knee;
other sites include the proximal humerus and
femur.
Clinical features
The patient presents with pain and sometimes
also swelling. Clinically there is usually warmth over
the affected area and there may be a palpable mass.
Diagnosis and investigation
X-rays (Fig. 22.4) may show:
• An ill-deﬁned lesion with an indistinct zone of
transition.
• Sclerotic or lytic areas within the lesion.
• Cortical destruction.
• Codman’s triangle (elevation of periosteum).
• ‘Sunray spicules’ (calciﬁcation within the
tumour but out of the bone).
Biopsy may be necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis.
Further investigations such as CT and MRI are
required to stage the lesion.

Fig. 22.4 X-ray of osteosarcoma (from Klippel J H, Dieppe P
A (eds) 1998 Rheumatology, 2nd edn. Mosby, London).

Treatment
A combined multidisciplinary team approach is
adopted.
Preoperative chemotherapy followed by limb
salvage surgery is performed if possible. Occasionally amputation is required.
Prognosis
5-year survival is 60%.

Ewing’s sarcoma
Incidence
Ewing’s sarcoma is extremely rare (less common
than osteosarcoma), occurring between 5 and 25
years of age.
Aetiology and pathology
Histologically this is a small cell sarcoma. It occurs
as frequently in ﬂat bones as in long bones, being
most common in the femur or tibia (long bone),
pelvis or vertebra (ﬂat bones).
These tumours are highly malignant and often
large at presentation.
Clinical features
Patients present with pain and may be unwell with
a fever. Clinically the area is warm and swelling may
be present.
Diagnosis and investigation
Diagnosis is usually made on X-ray appearance (Fig.
22.5), which is classically a lytic lesion with a laminated periosteal reaction (onion skinning).

A

CT and MRI help to stage the lesion.
Biopsy may be necessary.
Treatment
A combined multidisciplinary team approach is
adopted.
Preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by limb salvage surgery is performed if
possible.
Prognosis
5-year survival is 60%.

HAEMOPOIETIC DISEASES
Lymphoma and myeloma can present with bone
destruction.

B

Treatment
Chemotherapy and irradiation are commonly used
in conjunction.

Myeloma
Incidence
This is a rare tumour occurring between 50 and 80
years of age.

Aetiology and pathology
Lesions are due to a plasma cell malignancy, and are
found usually in the spine, ribs or clavicle.

Clinical features

Lymphoma

Bony pain is common and there may be a pathological fracture. Systemic symptoms of fatigue and fever
are very common.

Incidence

Diagnosis and investigation

Lymphoma is rare but can occur at any age.

Patients will have a high erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) and may have hypercalcaemia. Serum
electrophoresis and urinary analysis for Bence Jones
proteins conﬁrm the diagnosis.
X-rays show classic punched-out lytic lesions.

Aetiology and pathology
It is a small cell bone tumour arising from the
marrow, which can occur in any bone, most commonly around the knee.

Diagnosis and investigation
• X-rays show a long lesion with mottled bony
destruction.
• Isotope bone scanning excludes further
lesions.
• Biopsy conﬁrms the diagnosis.

160

Treatment
Chemotherapy is the mainstay with surgical stabilization or radiotherapy for impending fracture.

Prognosis
Overall prognosis is poor, with survival averaging 2
years.

Leukaemia

LEUKAEMIA
The last malignancy to mention is leukaemia—a
malignancy of white blood cells.
Leukaemia is the most common malignancy of
childhood and about one-third of patients have
bone pain. Leukaemia can also present with an
acutely hot, swollen joint very similar to septic
arthritis.

MUSCULOSKELETAL BACK PAIN
Back pain is extremely common and causes a signiﬁcant burden on the resources of westernized societies in terms of lost working days.

Deﬁnition
Musculoskeletal back pain is not a single speciﬁc
disease entity but rather a collection of ill-deﬁned
conditions presenting with low back pain. This diagnosis should only be made after other pathological
conditions have been excluded.

Incidence
60–80% of the population will have back pain at
some stage in their lives.

Implicated structures are listed in Figure 23.1.
• Facet joint arthritis shows the typical features of
osteoarthritis (OA) with joint space destruction
and osteophyte formation.
• Degenerative disc disease occurs with ageing
and is related to decreased water content in the
nucleus pulposus. The disc space narrows and
the segment is said to become more mobile. It
is this abnormal movement, together with an
inability to distribute load, that causes pain.
An interesting point is that patients rarely present
after the age of 60 and as the patient enters old age
usually the symptoms subside. This is said to be due
to stiffening of a mobile spine.

Clinical features
There are two typical clinical scenarios.

Aetiology and pathology
As back pain is so common it is difﬁcult to deﬁne
clear aetiological factors for its occurrence.
It is known, however, that patients with
chronic back pain are more likely to smoke, have a
medicolegal claim pending and be over 30 at
presentation.
There is much controversy about the exact pathology. One problem is that a lot of the pathological
changes seen will also be present in the healthy
‘normal’ population with no symptoms.

An acutely presenting patient with a
history of back pain over days or weeks
Pain is usually solely located to the back, possibly
following a precipitating incident.
Pain is severe and the patient may have difﬁculty
getting into a comfortable position. Sometimes the
patient has pain referred down the back of the leg
but this differs from true sciatica (radicular pain) in
that back pain is still the predominant feature and
the pain does not radiate to the foot.

163

Disorders of the spine

Possible causes of musculoskeletal back pain
Bone/periosteum
Paraspinous muscles spasm/sprain
Facet joint arthritis
Disc/degenerative disc disease
Posterior longitudinal ligament

Fig. 23.1 Possible causes of musculoskeletal back pain.

The pain is mechanical (i.e. worse on
movement).
Clinical examination will show muscle spasm
with loss of lumbar lordosis. The patient may ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to walk and spinal movements will be
minimal.
Sciatic stretch testing and peripheral nerve examination will be negative.

The chronic patient who has unrelenting
back pain for many years
The patient will be unable to work, may be overweight and depressed. Usually the patient has seen
numerous doctors, physiotherapists and other allied
health workers including alternative medical
practitioners.
The back pain is usually unrelenting and does not
have any relieving factors. Leg pain may or may not
be present.
Clinical examination rarely shows any signiﬁcant
features other than reduced movements. Inappropriate signs (Waddell’s signs) may be present (e.g.
increased pain on applying mild downward pressure
to the head).

Diagnosis and investigation
The majority of patients with a short history (less
than 6 weeks) and mechanical symptoms need no
further investigation.
Prolonged symptoms need investigation to
exclude sinister causes of back pain.
Blood tests including full blood count (FBC),
liver function tests (LFTs), calcium, myeloma screen,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) should all be normal in mechanical
back pain.
X-rays may show:
• Normal appearances.

164

Fig. 23.2 Osteoarthritis of the spine.

• Minor disc narrowing.
• Facet joint arthritis (Fig. 23.2).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed
tomography (CT) scanning are rarely helpful and
may be misleading if they highlight an abnormality
that may not be signiﬁcant.

Treatment
Conservative
Analgesia, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and physiotherapy are used for acute
low back pain. Prolonged bed rest should be
avoided.
Chronic patients are very difﬁcult to treat and
need a multidisciplinary approach to try to break
the pain cycle. Psychological input may be required,
as may the ‘pain team’. Occasionally facet joint injections for localized disease can relieve symptoms.

Surgical
This is controversial but some advocate spinal fusion
in a few very selected patients with degenerative disc
disease.

23

Prolapsed intervertebral disc

Prognosis
Most acute back pain episodes settle spontaneously
and the patient returns to normal.
Once chronic, the condition becomes extremely
difﬁcult to treat.

Nerve root
Disc prolapse

PROLAPSED INTERVERTEBRAL
DISC

Deﬁnition

A

A disc prolapse occurs when part of the nucleus
pulposus herniates through the annulus ﬁbrosus
and presses on a spinal nerve root.

Annulus fibrosis
Nucleus pulposus

Incidence
Disc prolapse is common—up to 3% of men and
1% of women will suffer with sciatica related to a
prolapsed intervertebral disc. Usual presentation is
between 35 and 55 years of age.

Aetiology and pathology
There is good evidence that manual workers involved
in heavy lifting have increased incidence of disc prolapse. Regular automobile use is also said to be a
risk factor.
The herniation of disc material tends to occur
posterolaterally where the annulus is thinner.
Central disc prolapse can occur and press on the
combined nerve roots, including those supplying
the bladder and bowel (cauda equina syndrome).
Prolapse can occur without spinal root involvement
in which case the patient will have symptoms of
back pain but not true sciatica.
Disc prolapse most commonly occurs at L4–L5
or L5–S1 level but can occur at any level (including
cervical and rarely thoracic). The nerve root crosses
its space before exiting the spine beneath the pedicle
(L4–L5 disc presses on L5 nerve root). See Figure
23.3.

Clinical features
Sciatica is a symptom of nerve root irritation. The
patient complains of severe pain radiating down the
leg into the toes. There may be numbness and tingling in the foot and weakness of the foot. Patients
ﬁnd it very uncomfortable to sit, and either stand or
lie down. Coughing and sneezing worsen the pain.

Nerve root
B
Fig. 23.3 Prolapsed intervertebral disc.

In cauda equina syndrome there is bladder and
bowel dysfunction with possibly urinary retention
and saddle anaesthesia.

Bilateral leg symptoms are suggestive of
impending cauda equina.

Clinically a patient will have an abnormal posture,
stooping to the affected side and standing with the
knee ﬂexed to relieve pressure on the dura (Fig.
23.4).
Nerve root tension signs such as straight leg
raising will be positive.
The crossover sign may be positive (elevation of
the opposite or normal leg gives pain shooting
down the affected leg).
Numbness in a dermatomal distribution and
weakness with loss of reﬂexes may be present.
In cauda equina there is loss of anal tone and
reduced perianal sensation.
Check for any sinister features (see Ch. 1, p. 4,
Fig. 1.2).

165

Disorders of the spine

Diagnosis and investigation
In older patients blood tests described above should
be performed to exclude any sinister causes.
X-rays are usually normal and are performed to
exclude bony pathology such as spondylolisthesis.
MRI scanning is now the investigation of choice
in patients with persistent symptoms (Fig. 23.5).

Fig. 23.5 MRI scan of prolapsed intervertebral disc at L4–L5
level.

SPONDYLOLISTHESIS

Deﬁnition
This means slipping of one vertebral body on
another.

Treatment
Conservative
A short period of bed rest followed by gentle physiotherapy with adequate analgesia (including
NSAIDs) is the initial treatment for most discs.

Surgical
The only indications for urgent surgical discectomy
are cauda equina syndrome and progressively worsening neurological deﬁcit.
If patients have prolonged symptoms (>6 weeks)
then surgery is considered.

It is easy to get confused with the
terminology. A spondylolysis is a defect
in the pars interarticularis which may
allow the vertebra to slip forward causing a
spondylolisthesis (forward slippage of one vertebra
on another).

Incidence
The condition is common (approximately 5% of the
population) but most are asymptomatic. It is more
common in Caucasian males.

Prognosis

Aetiology and pathology

70% of acute disc prolapses settle spontaneously
with conservative treatment.

Certain sports predispose to spondylolysis (gymnasts and fast bowlers in cricket).

166

23

Spinal stenosis

Spondylolysis

Fig. 23.6 Classic ‘Scottie dog’ appearance of
spondylolisthesis.

Spondylolisthesis can be caused by differing
pathology.
The slip usually occurs at the L5–S1 level. The
degree of slip is normally assessed as a percentage
and graded 1–4. There can be an associated kyphosis or scoliosis.

Clinical features
This condition is the most common cause of persistent back pain in children.
Initially back pain is the sole presentation but if
the slip becomes severe then nerve root irritation
will occur, causing sciatica. Radicular symptoms are
more common in the adult patient.
There is tenderness over the spine but sometimes
well-preserved movements (except in the arthritic
type of spondylolisthesis); classically hyperextension is painful.

Fig. 23.7 An L5–S1 spondylolisthesis with a pars defect.

Treatment
Conservative
Initial rest and restriction of activities may allow a
spondylolysis to heal before a slip occurs.
In adult patients a trial of conservative treatment
is advised with physiotherapy, analgesia and activity
modiﬁcation.

Surgical
Persistent pain, radiculopathy and signiﬁcant deformity are indications for surgery.
Fusion with metalwork and bone graft is commonly performed.

Prognosis
The outcome is variable, depending on the type and
degree of slip.

Diagnosis and investigation
Oblique X-rays may show the classic ‘collar on
Scottie dog’ appearance (Fig. 23.6), and the lateral
X-ray will show the degree of slippage (Fig.
23.7).
CT scans clearly demonstrate the lesion.
MRI should be performed if nerve root irritation
is suspected.

SPINAL STENOSIS

Deﬁnition
Spinal stenosis is caused by degenerative changes
narrowing the spinal canal and causing compression
of the nerve roots.

167

Disorders of the spine

Incidence
This is a common disorder mainly affecting men
over 50 years of age.

Aetiology and pathology

Examination will reveal stiffening of the spine
but sciatic stretch testing may be normal.
It is important to examine the peripheral vascular
system in such patients as vascular claudication
presents in a similar way.

Diagnosis and investigation

Spinal stenosis is more common in heavy manual
labourers.
It is usually secondary to degenerative changes.
Thickening of soft tissues, osteophytes and posterior
disc bulge encroach into the spinal canal (Fig.
23.8).
It is thought that ischaemia of the spinal nerves
during exercise produces the classic symptoms.

X-rays will usually show degenerative changes.
MRI shows the degree of stenosis and nerve root
involvement.
If suspected, exclude peripheral vascular insufﬁciency with Doppler scans.

Clinical features

Conservative

Typically patients present with discomfort when
walking, with pain referred to the buttock, calves
and feet. Back pain is usually present. Pain is worse
on extension and relieved by rest or ﬂexion of the
spine.

Weight loss, physiotherapy, activity modiﬁcation
and NSAIDs may relieve symptoms enough to avoid
surgery.

Treatment

Surgical
Severe symptoms not responding to conservative
measures require surgical decompression.

Prognosis
The condition tends to be progressive.

DISCITIS/VERTEBRAL
OSTEOMYELITIS

Deﬁnition
Discitis is infection of the disc space, and vertebral
osteomyelitis infection of a vertebral body.

Incidence
They are becoming more common, although still
rare.
Presentation can be at any age.

Aetiology and pathology

Fig. 23.8 MRI scan of spinal stenosis.

168

Conditions associated with other bone and joint
infection (see Ch. 18), particularly intravenous drug
use and immunocompromised patients, predispose
to spinal infection. Patients with recent sepsis
from pneumonia or urinary tract infection (UTI)
can subsequently develop discitis by seeding of
infection.

Scoliosis

23

Common infecting organisms are Staphylococcus
aureus and streptococci but tuberculosis should be
considered.

Clinical features
Patients are unwell with a pyrexia and complain of
severe unrelenting back pain.
Clinical examination may reveal a swelling and
in severe cases a gibbus. There is pain on palpation, reduced movement and possible abnormal
neurology.
Discitis commonly presents late, the patient often
having 6–12 weeks of symptoms before the correct
diagnosis is made.

Diagnosis and investigation
The white cell count (WCC), ESR and CRP are
elevated.
X-rays show narrowed disc space (discitis) and
bony destruction (osteomyelitis) (Fig. 23.9).
An isotope bone scan will be hot in the affected
area.
MRI scanning should be performed to detect any
epidural abscess.
CT guided biopsy should be obtained for culture
and sensitivity.

Treatment
Conservative

Fig. 23.9 MRI showing TB of the spine. There is complete
collapse of the vertebra (arrowed) with resultant kyphosis.

Intravenous antibiotics are given for 6 weeks.

Surgical
Any abscess should be drained and an unstable
spine with signiﬁcant deformity needs stabilization.

Prognosis
Prognosis is variable: childhood cases respond well
and should return to normality; severe adult infections can be life-threatening and surgery carries signiﬁcant risk.

Incidence
Up to 2.5% of the population are affected by idiopathic scoliosis.

Aetiology and pathology
Causes of scoliosis are listed in Figure 23.10.
In idiopathic scoliosis the exact cause is not
known.
Curves are thoracolumbar (Fig. 23.11).

Clinical features
SCOLIOSIS

Deﬁnition
This is a lateral deviation and rotational abnormality of the spine.

Pain is not usually a feature; rather the patient or
relatives complain of deformity, in the form of
an asymmetrical rib hump, spinal curve and limb
length inequality. For clinical examination, the
rib hump is more prominent on forward ﬂexion
(Fig. 23.12).

which can be life-threatening.

Diagnosis and investigation
Standing X-rays show the curve, and serial ﬁlms
are important to monitor the progress of the
curve.
A signiﬁcant increase in the severity of the curve
is often an indication for surgical stabilization.
MRI scans are performed to exclude any associated spinal cord abnormality.

170

Treatment
Conservative
The treatment depends on the angle of the curve
measured on the X-rays. In idiopathic scoliosis the
initial treatment is bracing for mild to moderate
curves.

Surgical
All congenital, most neuromuscular and severe or
progressive idiopathic curves will require surgical
stabilization, fusion and correction.

23

Prognosis

Further reading

The majority of curves are minor and require little
treatment.
Very severe neuromuscular curves can lead to
death due to cardiorespiratory compromise.

KNEE INJURIES

Introduction
The knee is commonly injured in sport—particularly soccer, rugby and skiing.
We will discuss injuries to the menisci, ligamentous injuries of the knee and patellar dislocation.

Meniscal injuries
The menisci are two semicircular ﬁbrocartilage structures that lie between the femoral and tibial articular
surfaces (Fig. 24.1). They act as ‘shock absorbers’
and are prone to injuries caused by the large forces
crossing the knee.

Incidence
Meniscal injuries are common, usually occurring in
young adult patients who participate in sports.

Pathology and aetiology
The medial meniscus is more commonly injured
because it is ﬁxed in comparison to the more mobile
lateral meniscus.

Meniscal tears can be traumatic or degenerative:
• Traumatic tears. The meniscus is normal
and injury usually occurs after landing or
twisting with the knee ﬂexed. This can be
associated with a ligamentous injury such as
an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. A
chronically unstable knee is prone to further
tears.
• Degenerative tears. These occur in an older
population through abnormal cartilage. They
may occur with little or no injury.

Types of meniscal tears (Fig. 24.2)
1. Bucket handle. The tear extends over a distance,
remaining attached at the anterior and
posterior horns. It can be displaced (in which
case the cartilage ﬂips over) or undisplaced
(the cartilage remains in its normal position).
A locked knee results when a large bucket
handle tear ﬂips over and becomes trapped in
the joint, resulting in loss of complete
extension.
2. Radial.
3. Horizontal cleavage.
4. Flap/parrot beak.

Patients usually give a history of injury while playing
sport, the incident occurring during a tackle or when
twisting or changing direction.
A patient may present immediately after injury
with a painful locked knee, or with a gradual
chronic nagging pain over months or years following minor injury. This variation reﬂects how the
different types and positions of tears manifest clinical symptoms.
Mechanical symptoms such as locking and catching suggest meniscal pathology. A ‘clicking joint’
does not necessarily mean there is pathology.
A more major injury with acute swelling and
instability suggests associated ligamentous injury.
Examination may reveal:
• A locked knee.
• An effusion:
—A large acute effusion suggests a very
peripheral tear (which bleeds) or an
associated injury
—A small chronic effusion is common.
• Joint line tenderness; this is an important part
of the examination and is usually positive in a
patient with a torn meniscus.
• A meniscal cyst, which may be palpable over
the lateral joint line.
A variety of special tests are described for meniscal
tears and none is very reliable.

Diagnosis and investigation
Meniscal cyst

Fig. 24.2 Meniscal lesions.

Of clinical importance is how peripheral the tear is.
Very peripheral tears occur through vascular tissue
and are amenable to repair, as these tears can heal.
Meniscal tears further away from the blood supply
(i.e. further into the knee) cannot heal.
Meniscal cysts result from synovial ﬂuid being
pumped into the meniscal tear. A valve effect means
the ﬂuid in the cyst cannot drain back into the knee.
See Figure 24.2.

174

In most cases the diagnosis is made solely on the
basis of history and examination.
X-rays are usually normal and are performed to
exclude osteoarthritis or other rare causes of knee
pain.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very useful
to conﬁrm the presence of torn menisci, particularly
in patients with a dubious history.
The most accurate way to conﬁrm the diagnosis
is with arthroscopy of the knee.

Management
Conservative
Initially RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) is
used for an acutely swollen knee. Early physiotherapy is essential to encourage movement.

Knee injuries
Surgical
Surgery is now performed using arthroscopic
techniques.
For peripheral bucket handle tears, meniscal
repair has the advantage of retaining the meniscus.
For tears not amenable to repair, meniscal resection is commonly performed. Partial meniscectomy
removes the damaged portion only, leaving a stable
rim and reducing the risk of osteoarthritis in the
future.

Prognosis
Removal of the meniscus leads to osteoarthritic
changes developing in the knee because of increased
load on the articular surface.
Meniscal repair is successful in 70% of cases.

Ligamentous injuries of the knee
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
Incidence
1 per 3000 of the population per year are affected.
Aetiology and pathology
The ACL is the primary restraint to anterior tibial
translation. The mechanism of injury is usually a
twisting or valgus strain pattern of injury commonly
occurring in soccer or skiing (Fig. 24.3).

Knee twist

24

The knee is usually extended or slightly ﬂexed
with the foot ﬁxed. Associated injuries to the
medial collateral ligament and either meniscus
are common.
ACL-deﬁcient knees are liable to further meniscal
tears.
Clinical features
With an acute ACL rupture, the patient will be
unable to play on and may have to be carried from
the ﬁeld. Many patients present a long time after
injury with symptoms of instability.
The patient often hears a ‘pop’ or feels ‘something
go’ inside the knee.
Swelling typically occurs within a few hours
unlike meniscal tears which swell over 24 hours,
because the ACL is more vascular than the menisci.
Once initial symptoms have settled, the patient
may complain of giving way of the knee. This occurs
when the patient tries to turn rapidly. Classically the
patient will report being able to run in a straight line
but not being able to ‘twist and turn’.
Clinically, patients have a tense effusion after an
acute injury.
The anterior drawer, Lachmann’s and pivot shift
tests are positive (see Ch. 29).
Diagnosis and investigation
The majority can be diagnosed clinically.
In some patients it is difﬁcult to elicit positive
examination ﬁndings and in those patients an MRI
scan or examination under anaesthetic (EUA) is
useful to conﬁrm the diagnosis.
X-rays will usually be normal.
Management
Conservative Initial treatment is with RICE and
physiotherapy. A proportion of patients can modify
their activities and manage with a hamstring rehabilitation programme only.

Surgical ACL reconstruction is indicated for functional instability of the knee. With modern techniques this is now performed arthroscopically using
a hamstring tendon graft. Meniscal tears can also be
addressed at the time of surgery.
Prognosis
Chronic instability associated with meniscal pathology leads to early osteoarthritis (OA). Early ACL
reconstruction can protect the knee from further
meniscal injury.

Tibia

Knee hits dashboard and

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
The PCL is the primary restraint to posterior movement of the tibia on the femur.
Incidence
PCL injuries are rare.
Aetiology and pathology
PCL injuries occur either in sporting activities or
from road trafﬁc accidents (dashboard injury) (Fig.
24.4).
Classically it is a goalkeeper’s injury in soccer, the
mechanism of injury being the knee combining
with an onrushing attacking player forcing the tibia
backwards. The PCL can also rupture when the knee
is forcibly hyperextended.
The majority of PCL tears occur in combination
with other ligamentous injuries.
Clinical features
The patient will have a substantial injury to the knee
and will usually be unable to bear weight. Swelling
is usually less obvious than with an ACL injury.
Patients complain less of instability than with
ACL injuries.
Clinically, patients will have a posterior sag and
positive posterior drawer test.
Careful assessment is needed to look for associated injuries such as lateral collateral injuries.
Treatment
Conservative Almost all isolated PCL injuries can
be treated with rehabilitation alone.

176

Surgical Patients with combined injuries or symptomatic instability require reconstruction.
Prognosis
In the short term PCL injuries often follow a benign
course and are often asymptomatic in certain sports
players (a professional rugby league team will have
several players who are PCL deﬁcient).
Osteoarthritis develops in the long term (25
years).

Lateral collateral injuries
Incidence
These are rare injuries.
Aetiology and pathology
Isolated lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injuries
occur when a varus strain is placed on the knee
(i.e. a hit from the medial side; Fig. 24.5).
Associated injuries to the PCL or ACL can occur.
Clinical features
The patient will complain of pain and possibly
instability.
In the normal knee the LCL is easily palpable as
a cord-like structure. When the LCL is ruptured, the
area is tender and indistinct.
Opening up of the joint on the lateral side will
be present on collateral testing.
Management
Almost all isolated injuries heal well with conservative treatment.

Medial collateral injuries
Incidence
These are common injuries in isolation or combined with ACL injury.
Aetiology and pathology
There is a valgus strain pattern of injury. The injury
can be complete or partial, and can be associated
with ACL injury.
Clinical features
This is usually a sporting injury; the patient may feel
‘something go’ but an effusion is not a feature of an
isolated medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear (it is
an extra-articular structure).
Tenderness over the broad attachment of the
MCL and opening up of the joint on collateral
stressing are examination features.
Management
Treatment is with physiotherapy and bracing for 6
weeks. Minor tears heal well without bracing.
Surgical advancement is sometimes required for
chronic unstable injuries.
Prognosis
The knee usually returns to normal after a period of
rehabilitation.

Patellar dislocation
Introduction
The patella is prevented from dislocation by anatomical features such as a large lateral femoral
condyle and the insertion of vastus medialis oblique
(VMO) (Fig. 24.6).

177

Sports injuries

Incidence

SHOULDER DISLOCATION

Patellar dislocation is quite common.

Incidence
Aetiology and pathology
Patellar dislocation can be habitual or traumatic.
Habitual dislocators are often young women
with ligamentous laxity and a hypoplastic femoral
condyle. This group get recurrent dislocations after
minor injuries, often without trauma, and are difﬁcult to treat.
Traumatic dislocations occur during sports, usually with the knee slightly ﬂexed with side impact. The
dislocation occurs laterally and damage may occur
to the joint surface. Structures along the medial
border of the patella are torn.

Clinical features
A ﬁrst-time dislocation is extremely painful and the
patient arrives in casualty with the patella laterally
placed.
Often there is tenderness over the medial side of
the knee and an effusion.
Later when the acute injury has settled the patient
may have patella apprehension and a J-sign (see Ch.
29). Habitual dislocators may show evidence of generalized laxity in other joints such as ﬁngers, thumbs,
elbows and knees.

The shoulder is the most commonly dislocated large
joint in the body.

Aetiology and pathology
The shoulder is at risk of dislocation because the
joint has very little inherent bony stability, with reliance instead on capsule, ligaments and rotator cuff
muscles. The joint has ‘sacriﬁced’ stability for
movement.
The dislocation can be anterior or posterior. Anterior dislocation (Fig. 24.7) accounts for 98% and
usually occurs when the arm is forced back in a
‘ball throwing’ position of external rotation and
abduction.
Posterior dislocations occur with epileptic seizures and electrocutions.
In anterior dislocation the capsule is damaged
antero-inferiorly, leaving a so-called Bankart lesion
predisposing to further dislocations. Recurrent dislocations cause a Hill–Sachs lesion due to impaction of the glenoid on the posterior part of the
humeral head.
In older patients the rotator cuff is torn rather
than a Bankart lesion developing.

Diagnosis and investigation
X-rays should be taken after reduction, including a
tunnel and skyline view looking for any osteochondral defects.
Glenoid

Management
Conservative
Initial reduction is required, usually under sedation
in the accident and emergency (A&E) department.
Physiotherapy is required once pain and swelling
allows improvement of range of movement and
quadriceps strength.
Surgical
Large osteochondral defects should be repaired or
removed arthroscopically.
Recurrent dislocations may require surgical
realignment. Repair or reconstruction of the medial
patello-femoral ligament is gaining in popularity.

24

Clinical features

Treatment

The patient is often a sports player—typically
rugby—and has an acute injury to the shoulder as
described above. The injury is intensely painful and
the shoulder is held supported by the other arm
(Fig. 24.8).
Examination ﬁndings include:

Conservative
The dislocation needs to be promptly reduced in the
A&E department under sedation.
Posterior dislocation often requires a general
anaesthetic and may need open reduction.

• Loss of normal contour.
• Palpable glenoid.
• Complete loss of movement.

A

Diagnosis and investigation
Anterior dislocation is usually obvious and conﬁrmed with X-rays (also performed to exclude a
fracture).
Posterior dislocation is often missed as the initial
anteroposterior (AP) X-ray looks normal to the
untrained eye. This should be suspected in any
patient who has ﬁxed internal rotation of the
shoulder.
The ‘light bulb sign’ (Fig. 24.9A) should raise
suspicion but the diagnosis is made on axillary view
(Fig. 24.9B) or CT scan.

impaction of the head from the glenoid rim (arrowed).

179

Sports injuries
Once the dislocation is reduced, the joint is rested
in a collar and cuff and once the pain has settled,
supervised early rehabilitation with the physiotherapist can commence.

Surgical
Surgery is reserved for the recurrent dislocations to
repair bone or labral defects.
Talus inverts
during injury

Prognosis
A young male sportsman has an 80% chance of
recurrent dislocation following anterior dislocation
of the shoulder.
In the more elderly population shoulder stiffness
is more of a problem than recurrence.

Your current textbook may advise 6
weeks’ immobilization for patellar and
shoulder dislocations to allow the ‘soft
tissues to heal’. This is old-fashioned thinking and a
short period of rest (3–5 days) is now followed by
early rehabilitation.

Lateral
ligaments
torn

Fig. 24.10 Ankle ligament rupture.

Clinically the patient has a variable amount of
swelling and tenderness over the lateral ligament
complex.
Patients may have instability of the ankle joint
with a positive anterior drawer test and opening of
the lateral side.

Diagnosis and investigation

ANKLE SPRAIN

X-rays are performed only if there is bony tenderness
or inability to weight bear (Ottowa ankle rules).

Incidence

Management

This is a very common injury.

Conservative
All sprains are treated conservatively initially with
analgesia, RICE and physiotherapy.

Aetiology and pathology
The injury is commonly found on the sports ﬁeld
but anyone can have an ankle sprain. The mechanism of injury is inversion with damage to the lateral
ligament complex.
As the talus tilts in the ankle mortice, the anterior
taloﬁbular and calcaneoﬁbular ligaments are torn
(Fig. 24.10).

Clinical features
The patient experiences pain and may feel ‘something go’; swelling occurs rapidly.
Chronic ankle instability leads to giving way of
the joint.

180

Surgical
Arthroscopy of the ankle is sometimes performed
for associated osteochondral injuries.
Rarely, ligament reconstruction is required for a
chronically unstable ankle.

Peripheral nerve lesions

25

Objectives
In this chapter you will learn:
• The conditions that predispose to carpal tunnel syndrome.
• To recognize the symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome.
• The clinical consequences of damage to the ulnar, radial and common peroneal
nerves.

CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

Deﬁnition
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) results from compression of the median nerve as it passes through
the carpal tunnel at the wrist. The carpal tunnel is
formed by the space between the transverse carpal
ligament and the carpal bones.

Don’t expect every patient
with carpal tunnel syndrome
to complain of pain radiating
from the wrist to their thumb,
index and middle ﬁngers. Patients often ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to localize their symptoms and they may
complain that their whole forearm and hand feel
painful and/or numb.

Incidence
CTS is common, especially in middle-aged and
elderly women.

Aetiology
CTS is usually idiopathic, but can be associated with
several underlying conditions (Fig. 25.1).

Clinical features
CTS presents with pain and/or paraesthesia in the
median nerve distribution (Fig. 25.2). These symptoms can radiate proximally towards the elbow.
They are often worse at night and classically wake
the patient from sleep.
Examination may reveal sensory loss in the
median nerve distribution, but can be unremarkable. The strength of the thenar muscles should be
tested. These may be weak and wasted in advanced
disease. The opponens pollicis muscle is tested by
asking the patient to touch the thumb to the little
ﬁnger and resist attempts to separate the two.
Phalen’s and Tinel’s tests may reproduce the symptoms (Fig. 25.3).

Investigations
Nerve conduction studies show reduced nerve conduction velocities across the wrist. Investigations
such as thyroid function tests should be performed
to exclude underlying medical conditions.

Management
The most successful treatment is surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel by division of the
transverse carpal ligament. This can be performed
under local anaesthetic. Wrist splints may help nocturnal symptoms, and corticosteroid injection of the
carpal tunnel may bring some relief.

ULNAR NERVE ENTRAPMENT

Deﬁnition
The ulnar nerve can become compressed as it passes
behind the medial epicondyle or through Guyon’s
canal in the wrist.

Patients develop pain and/or paraesthesiae in the
medial side of the elbow, which radiates to the
medial forearm and the ulnar nerve distribution in
the hand (see Fig. 25.2). The pain is often exacerbated by elbow ﬂexion.
Examination usually reveals reduced sensation in
the ulnar nerve distribution. Palpation of the nerve
behind the medial epicondyle may provoke the
symptoms. Motor dysfunction may result in atrophy
of the hypothenar eminence. Abduction and adduction of the ﬁngers is weak. There may be clawing of
the hand due to weakness of the intrinsic muscles
(Fig. 25.5).

Incidence

Investigations

Ulnar nerve damage at the elbow is fairly common
due to its superﬁcial position.

Nerve conduction studies conﬁrm the diagnosis and
establish the site of compression.

182

Common peroneal nerve injuries

25

Management
The wrist should be splinted immediately and the
cause of the radial nerve palsy should be assessed.
If there is no resolution, tendon transfer or nerve
grafting may be indicated.

COMMON PERONEAL
NERVE INJURIES

Aetiology
Fig. 25.5 Clawing of the hand due to ulnar nerve palsy.

Management
Ulnar nerve compression due to elbow synovitis
may respond to corticosteroid injection of the elbow.
Surgical decompression should be performed if
sensory symptoms cannot be tolerated or if there is
muscle weakness or wasting.

RADIAL NERVE INJURIES

Aetiology
Radial nerve compression at the axilla is typically
seen in a drunk person who falls asleep with an arm
hanging over the back of a chair (‘Saturday night
palsy’). The radial nerve may also be injured by
fractures of the humerus.

Clinical features
The wrist extensors are paralysed, resulting in wrist
drop. Grip strength is dramatically reduced, as the
ﬁnger ﬂexors do not function well with the wrist in
a ﬂexed position. Nerve injury in the axilla will also
lead to paralysis of the triceps. Due to nerve overlap,
sensory loss only affects a small area of skin on the
dorsum of the hand between the ﬁrst and second
metacarpals.

The common peroneal nerve winds around the neck
of the ﬁbula and is in a vulnerable position. It may
be damaged by fractures of the neck of ﬁbula or
pressure from a tight bandage or plaster cast.

Clinical features
Common peroneal nerve injury results in paralysis
of the ankle and foot extensors. Unopposed action
of the foot ﬂexors and inverters cause the foot to be
plantar ﬂexed and inverted. This is referred to as
‘foot drop’. Patients develop a high-stepping gait,
ﬂicking the foot forwards to avoid tripping over it.
There is also loss of sensation over the anterior and
lateral sides of the leg and the dorsum of the foot
and toes.

Management
Pressure on the nerve should be relieved and a splint
should be applied. If the foot drop does not resolve,
an ankle–foot orthosis can be used to maintain
some degree of dorsiﬂexion.

Soft tissue disorders

26

Objectives
In this chapter you will learn:
• About problems affecting tendons (tendinopathy, tenosynovitis and tendon rupture).
• How to recognize, investigate and treat bursitis.
• Which factors predispose to Dupuytren’s contracture.

Introduction

Clinical features

Soft tissue disorders are common. They are responsible for many days of absence from work and contribute signiﬁcantly to the workload in primary care,
accident and emergency departments, and rheumatology and orthopaedic clinics. This chapter will
discuss the presentation, diagnosis and management of some common soft tissue lesions.

The most frequent sites of tendinopathy are the:

TENDON LESIONS

• Shoulder.
• Elbow.
• Achilles tendon.
Patients complain of pain that is worsened by active
movement. Examination ﬁndings include:
• Tenderness of the tendon and its insertion.
• An increase in pain when active movement is
performed against resistance.
• Soft tissue swelling (not always present).

The three main pathologies that affect tendons are:
• Tendinopathy.
• Tenosynovitis.
• Rupture.

Tendinopathy
Deﬁnition
Pain arises from strain or injury to tendons and
their insertions to bone. The term ‘enthesopathy’ is
used to describe cases with a signiﬁcant periosteal
component, such as lateral epicondylitis (tennis
elbow).

An example: tennis elbow and golfer’s elbow
In these conditions, pain is centred around the
lateral and medial epicondyles respectively, although
it may radiate distally from the elbow. The examination ﬁndings are as follows:
Tennis elbow The origin of the forearm extensors is
tender, and pain is exacerbated by resisted wrist
extension (Fig. 26.1A). Pain on extension of the ring
ﬁnger is particularly speciﬁc for tennis elbow.
Golfer’s elbow The origin of the forearm ﬂexors is
tender, and pain is exacerbated by resisted wrist
ﬂexion (Fig. 26.1B).

Aetiopathogenesis

Investigation of tendinopathy

The pathogenesis of tendinopathy is poorly understood. Some cases occur as part of a systemic inﬂammatory condition and others are related to injury
from overuse. However, most cases of tendinopathy
are idiopathic.

Tendinopathy can be diagnosed clinically and investigations are often unremarkable. Radiographs may
show abnormalities, such as calciﬁcation in chronic
rotator cuff disease. Ultrasound may also detect
changes in the tendon and surrounding tissue.

Management of tendinopathy
The interventions shown below may lead to improvement of symptoms. The strategies at the top of the
list should be employed early in the disease process,
whilst those at the bottom should be reserved for
resistant cases:
• Rest or avoidance of precipitating cause.
• Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID)
therapy.
• Local corticosteroid injection.
• Ultrasound therapy.
• Surgery.

Tenosynovitis
Deﬁnition
Tenosynovitis is inﬂammation of the synovial lining
of a tendon sheath.

Aetiology

are the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons (De Quervain’s tenosynovitis)
and ﬁnger ﬂexors. On examination, the tendon is
swollen and tender, and crepitus may be felt on
palpation.
A trigger ﬁnger or thumb results from tenosynovitis of the ﬂexor tendons. A nodule can develop
on the tendon in response to constriction of the
tendon sheath. The nodule ‘catches’ as it enters or
leaves the ﬂexor tunnel and a ‘snapping’ or ‘ﬂicking’ movement of the digit occurs on ﬂexion or
extension.

Management
Treatment includes rest, splinting and local corticosteroid injection. Surgical decompression of the
tendon sheath may be required.

Tendon rupture
Aetiology
Tendon rupture may result from chronic inﬂammation and degeneration or trauma. For example,
rupture of the extensor tendons of the ﬁngers is
often seen in rheumatoid arthritis.

The two main causes are:

Clinical features

• Inﬂammatory arthritis.
• Trauma.

The resulting clinical features are loss of movement
at the joint to which the tendon provides power,
deformity and sometimes swelling. After rupture of
the biceps tendon, a bulge formed by the lateral
muscle belly is seen in the upper arm. Extensor
tendon rupture at the distal end of the ﬁnger can
occur when catching a cricket ball. It results in
ﬂexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint
(‘Mallet ﬁnger’) (Fig. 26.2).

Trauma usually results from repetitive or unaccustomed movement.

Clinical features
Patients present with pain in the region of the
affected tendon. Common sites of tenosynovitis

186

Dupuytren’s contracture

Management
Surgery can often be performed to repair the tendon
and restore function.

BURSITIS
Bursae are small sacs of ﬁbrous tissue that are lined
with synovial membrane, which secrete synovial
ﬂuid. They reduce friction where ligaments and
tendons pass over bone. Inﬂammation of a bursa
(bursitis) can be idiopathic, part of a systemic
inﬂammatory disease or due to injury, infection or
gout. Some types are notiﬁable industrial disorders
(e.g. coal miner’s ‘beat’ knee).
Olecranon bursitis and prepatellar bursitis are
common and their clinical features and management are discussed below.

Olecranon bursitis
This can be precipitated by excessive friction at the
elbow, for example by resting the elbow on a desk.
Septic olecranon bursitis causes pain on elbow
ﬂexion. Idiopathic and traumatic cases are usually
only painful when pressure is applied to the bursa;
movement of the elbow is not usually uncomfortable or impaired. On examination the bursa is distended and tender.
Bursal ﬂuid should be aspirated to exclude infection and improve symptoms. Local corticosteroid
injection is effective in non-septic cases. Infection
should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Soft tissue lesions are
commonly precipitated by
overuse injuries. It is therefore
important to ask patients
about their work and leisure activities.

26

develops over the front of the patella. Active knee
extension is usually quite painful. Infection and
gout should be excluded by aspirating ﬂuid. Treatment involves rest. Recurrent episodes may require
surgical excision of the bursa. Antibiotic therapy
should be given for sepsis.

DUPUYTREN’S CONTRACTURE

Deﬁnition
Dupuytren’s contracture is a common condition,
characterized by nodular ﬁbrosis of the palmar
fascia, which draws one or more ﬁngers into
ﬂexion.

Incidence
Before the age of 55, the incidence of Dupuytren’s
contracture is much higher in men than women.
After this time the incidence is equal.

Aetiology
Several factors predispose to Dupuytren’s contracture. These are shown in Figure 26.3.

Clinical features
The ulnar side of the hand is most commonly
affected. Patients complain of inability to extend
one or more ﬁngers, usually the ring and little
ﬁngers. It is rarely painful. The ﬁbrosis may remain
stable or progress. Progressive cases can result in
marked deformity and loss of function, with the
ﬁngers held in a ﬁxed position curled into the
palm.
In early cases, nodules may be felt in the palm or
on the palmar surface of the ﬁnger. In more advanced
cases, ﬂexion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP)

Management
The most effective treatment is surgery. Palmar fasciectomy is the most commonly performed procedure. There is a risk of recurrence postoperatively.

Taking a history

27

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand why history taking is so important in making a diagnosis.
• Take a detailed history of a presenting complaint using ‘open’ and ‘closed’ questions
and determine the functional impact of a condition.

Good history taking is a valuable skill and crucial to
making a correct diagnosis. It is important to establish a good rapport with patients. A relaxed, trusting
patient will ﬁnd it easier to share information with
you and answer your questions.
The ﬁrst things to document in your history are:
• The patient’s name, age, date of birth, sex and
hospital number.
• The date, time and place of the consultation
(e.g. accident and emergency department).
• The patient’s occupation and dominant hand.
• The source of referral, e.g. GP referral.

Problems affecting the dominant upper
limb will be more disabling than those
affecting the non-dominant side.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENTING
COMPLAINT

Begin your history with open
questions, e.g. ‘Tell me about
your pain’, then ask closed
questions if necessary, e.g.
‘Does your knee ever give way?’.

This should contain details of the patient’s presenting symptoms from their onset to the current time.
The following areas should be discussed when taking
a rheumatological or orthopaedic history:

Symptom onset
PRESENTING COMPLAINT
This should be a short statement, summarizing the
patient’s presenting symptoms. The following are
some examples:
• Painful right knee.
• Pain and stiffness of both arms.

• Date and time of symptom onset.
• Speed of onset—was it acute or gradual?
• Presence of any precipitating factors, such as
trauma, commencement of a new drug, etc.

Pain, swelling and stiffness
Establish the following points:

191

Taking a history
•
•
•
•
•

Site and radiation.
Nature.
Periodicity—is it continuous or intermittent?
Exacerbating and relieving factors.
Timing—is it worse at any particular time of
day?

As a rule, pain and stiffness due to inﬂammatory
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis are worse
ﬁrst thing in the morning and improve as the day
progresses. The duration of the early morning stiffness is quite a good guide to the severity of the
inﬂammation. In contrast, pain due to a mechanical
or degenerative problem tends to be worse later
in the day and associated with a milder degree of
stiffness.

Deformity
Some patients consult their doctor because they
have developed a deformity and are concerned. This
may or may not be associated with pain.

Weakness
It is important to ascertain whether this is localized
or generalized. Localized weakness suggests a focal
problem, such as a peripheral nerve lesion, whereas
generalized weakness is more likely to have a systemic cause.

Numbness
The distribution of numbness or paraesthesia should
be documented, as well as any precipitating factors.
For example, if numbness affects the radial three
and a half ﬁngers, it is probably due to carpal tunnel
syndrome. If it affects all the digits, is associated
with pallor and provoked by cold weather, Raynaud’s phenomenon is more likely.

Functional loss and disability
These are common in musculoskeletal disease and
can be due to pain, weakness, deformity or any
of the other problems discussed above. Loss of
function refers to a person’s inability to perform
an action, such as gripping an object or walking.
Disability is the result that functional loss has on
the individual’s ability to lead a full and active
life.

Always record a patient’s level of
function in the notes. It is a good marker
of progress.

Any restriction that a patient’s disease has on their
activities of daily living should be documented.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
Ask about all current and previous medical and surgical disorders, including any musculoskeletal problems. In certain situations, it is worth asking about
speciﬁc illnesses. For example, a patient with carpal
tunnel syndrome may have underlying hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus.

DRUG HISTORY
The drug history is always important, but it sometimes has great relevance to orthopaedic and rheumatological problems. Acute gout can be precipitated
by the initiation of diuretic therapy, and long-term
corticosteroid use can cause osteoporosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY
Record relevant information about the patient’s
domestic situation, degree of independence, smoking
and alcohol intake.

FAMILY HISTORY
Ask particularly about a family history of musculoskeletal disease.

SYSTEMIC ENQUIRY
This should include a brief review of any symptoms
affecting other systems of the body. It is particularly
relevant if you think the patient might have a connective tissue disease.

General principles of
examining joints

28

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Establish a rapport with the patient and remember never to hurt the patient.
• Recognize pathological gait patterns.
• Develop a logical routine for examination of a joint.

GETTING OFF TO THE
RIGHT START
It is important to establish a rapport with the patient,
and you should look smart and be polite!
Always remember to introduce yourself and start
by asking if any area is painful before you touch the
patient. The last thing you want to do is hurt the
patient. There are also speciﬁc marks for these acts
of courtesy in the Objective Structured Clinical
Examination (OSCE).
It is a cliché but the examination really does
start when the patient enters the room. One of the
ﬁrst things to notice is how the patient walks. Pathological gait patterns are shown in Figure 28.1. Also
note how the patient enters the room. The patient
could be in a wheelchair, use a stick or walk
unaided.
Watch how reliant patients are on relatives during
simple tasks such as getting undressed or getting up
from a chair.
As soon as you see the patient you should be
making a mental note of any features on inspection
such as typical features of rheumatoid arthritis in
the hands.
Start your examination as you normally would,
by looking at the hands ﬁrst and then moving to the
face and so on. Often the majority of features are
normal, as in the case of a single osteoarthritic
joint.
A thorough general examination is required for
patients presenting with:
• Polyarthritis—these patients may have an
inﬂammatory arthropathy, and a general

examination is tailored towards looking for
extra-articular manifestations. Examination of
the cardiovascular system, respiratory system
and abdomen is required.
• Widespread aches and pains—these patients
may have an inﬂammatory arthritis, connective
tissue disorder or malignancy. Examination of
other systems is required, such as the skin, eyes
and other joints.

EXAMINING JOINTS
• Start with adequate exposure.
• Stand and walk the patient.
• Position the patient for the joint to be
examined. Make the patient comfortable and
make sure you can get to the correct side of the
patient.

When examining joints make sure you
stand on the side of the joint to be
examined. Don’t lean across the patient
to examine the opposite hip or knee. A really nasty
examiner might put the couch up against the wall
and ask you to examine the knee that is beside the
wall. If this happens move the couch to the centre
of the room!

• MOVE:
—Demonstrate joint movement actively and
passively.
• Any special tests to remember?
• Examine the joints above and below.
• Don’t forget peripheral pulses.
Practise a routine on your friends.

194

Using these basic principles of examining
joints you can examine any joint.
For example, if asked, you could
examine the temporomandibular joint (I don’t
expect you to be able to do it) by applying the
basic rules.

Examination of joints

29

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Know how to examine the major joints of the upper and lower limbs and spine.
• Describe special examination tests for each joint.
• Describe the MRC grading for assessment of power and be able to perform a full
neurological examination of the limbs.

EXAMINATION OF THE HIP
Hip disease is common and examination involves
the use of a few special tests that often cause confusion. Unlike with other joints the special tests are
used ﬁrst when examining the hip.

As a general principle always examine
the joints above and below. Remember
to examine the peripheral neurovascular
system.

Gait
A Trendelenburg gait (waddling) is due to failure of
the hip abductors to elevate the pelvis on weight
bearing, causing a dipping or rolling gait. To compensate for this the trunk is swung over the weightbearing hip, which maintains balance.
Failure of hip abduction can be due to pain or
ineffectual muscle function following hip surgery
(see Fig. 29.1).
The patient may also have an antalgic gait (see
Fig. 28.1, p. 194).

Trendelenburg’s test
This is used to assess the function of the hip
abductors.
Stand face on to the patient and put your hands
on the patient’s pelvis, then ask the patient to place

their hands on your forearms to steady themselves.
Ask the patient then to lift each leg in turn and
watch for pelvic tilt. Remember it is the standing leg
you are testing and show the patient they should lift
up the leg behing them by bending at the knee. (If
the hip is ﬂexed this can tilt the pelvis)
If the abductors are not functioning the pelvis
tilts downwards towards the unsupported leg (Fig.
29.1B and D).

Thomas’ test
This is a test for ﬁxed ﬂexion of the hip.
The idea of the test is to abolish the natural
lumbar lordosis of the spine and visualize the true
degree of ﬂexion deformity at the hip.
To perform the test, the patient is positioned
supine (ﬂat on the back) and the opposite hip is
ﬂexed fully. This manoeuvre fully corrects the lordosis that is felt by placing a hand under the spine.
Now simply observe the degree (if any) of hip
ﬂexion (Fig. 29.2).

Leg length discrepancy
Ensure the patient is lying comfortably on the examination couch with the knees straight.
Measure both limbs from the anterior superior
iliac spine to the medial malleolus and compare the
values.
An idea of where any leg length discrepancy lies
can be obtained by ﬂexing both hips and knees and
placing them together. Look from the side and determine the relative positions of the knees.
If one knee is higher than the other then this
suggests tibial shortness; however, if one knee lies

Inspection
Scars from previous surgery could be present anteriorly, laterally or medially. Look for erythema, sinuses
and muscle wasting. Look at both sides of the hip
by turning the patient to the prone position.

EXAMINATION OF THE KNEE
The knee lies superﬁcially and many landmarks are
easily palpable.

Don’t forget to examine the hip if asked
to examine the knee.

Inspection
Ask the patient to stand and walk, and note any gait
abnormality.
Deformities (varus, valgus and ﬁxed ﬂexion) are
more obvious on standing.
Look for quadriceps wasting, which can be
assessed by measuring the thigh circumference and

comparing it with the measurement on the other
side.
Localized swelling anteriorly or posteriorly may
be visible (remember to inspect the back of the
knee—this is easily done with the patient standing).
Note an effusion (which can be seen by loss of
normal skin dimples at the joint line), scars, erythema or sinuses.

Palpation for an effusion
A knee effusion is important to recognize (Fig. 29.5)
as it always indicates pathology. There are two tests
commonly used.

Patella tap
Fluid is milked down from the suprapatellar pouch,
which lifts the patella away from the femur. The
patella is then pushed down onto the femur producing a ‘tap’ (Fig. 29.6).

197

Examination of joints

Wipe test

Palpation

Fluid is milked out of the medial dimple. The examining hand then sweeps the ﬂuid from the lateral
side of the knee, reﬁlling the medial dimple with a
visible bulge.

Flexing the knee to 90° allows structures to be palpated more easily.
Be methodical, starting distally over the tibial
tubercle and moving proximally, palpating in turn
the patellar tendon, proximal tibia, medial and
lateral joint lines, femoral condyles, patella, and
quadriceps tendon (Fig. 29.7). The collateral ligaments are also palpable (the lateral collateral is a
cord-like structure more easily felt with the knee in
the ﬁgure of four position).
Remember to palpate the posterior aspect of the
knee. A Baker’s cyst or bursa may be present.

Movement
Both active and passive movement should be tested.
The normal range is 0–150° (Fig. 29.8). Note any
ﬁxed ﬂexion or hyperextension of the knee. Feel for
patellar crepitus during ﬂexion.

Special tests
Different patients have different degrees of laxity of
the ligaments. It is therefore important to compare
your examination with the normal side.

Collateral ligaments
This test should be performed in full extension and
30° ﬂexion (instability in full extension is not
present in an isolated ligament rupture and therefore indicates a much more severe injury).

Examination of the knee
The foot is held between the examiner’s elbow
and body and both of the examiner’s hands are
placed on either side of the patient’s knee (Fig.
29.9). A valgus or varus strain can then be placed on
the knee and opening up of the joint noted.

199

Examination of joints
Flex the knee to 30°. Then, with the thumbs
pointing towards the patient’s hip, place one hand
around the proximal tibia and stabilize the femur
with the other. Lift up on the tibia seeing if there is
abnormal forward movement (Fig. 29.10).
Anterior drawer test
This is also a test for ACL deﬁciency but can be
misleading (the anterior drawer test can be positive

Fig. 29.10 Lachman’s test for anterior cruciate ligament
deﬁciency.

after medial meniscectomy or in posterior cruciate
ligament (PCL) deﬁciency).
The knee is ﬂexed to 90° and the hamstrings are
relaxed. The examiner sits carefully on the patient’s
foot and both thumbs are placed on the proximal
tibia and over both joint lines. The tibia is pulled
forward and if movement is excessive the test is
positive.
Pivot shift test
It can be a difﬁcult test to perform, but the pivot
shift is very useful in that it represents the way in
which an ACL-deﬁcient knee causes instability and
hence gives way.
The test relies on the knee pivoting around the
medial collateral ligament and uses the iliotibial
band to move the tibia anteriorly.
The ﬂexed knee is held in internal rotation with
a valgus force applied as the knee is extended (Fig.
29.11). As the knee comes from ﬂexion to extension
at about 15° the tibia jumps forward into a subluxed
position.

Fig. 29.11 The pivot shift test for instability of the anterior cruciate ligament.

200

Examination of the ankle and foot

29

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)

The patellofemoral joint

The posterior drawer test is performed exactly as the
anterior drawer but the knee is pushed backwards.
The classic sign for a PCL rupture is the posterior
sag. This is demonstrated by ﬂexing both knees to
90° and comparing the knee contour (Fig. 29.12). A
sag occurs as the tibia falls posteriorly and the tibial
tubercle becomes less prominent.

To examine the patellofemoral joint, sit the patient
on the edge of the couch so that the legs are free to
ﬂex. Watch the patella carefully as the knee extends
and look at how the patella tracks. Lateral maltracking is demonstrated as the patella deviates laterally
towards the end of extension.
Patella apprehension is demonstrated when the
examiner tries to push the patella laterally when
the patient’s knee is fully extended on the couch. If
the patella is unstable the patient will grimace.

Examining menisci
The most commonly used test is Mcmurray’s test. It
is difﬁcult to perform and all surgeons have a different way of doing it!
The idea of the test is to ‘catch’ a torn meniscus
between the tibial and femoral joint surface. Flex the
affected knee as much as possible and load the
medial or lateral compartment with a valgus or
varus force, apply an axial load (i.e. push the two
surfaces together) and rotate the leg as the knee is
extended. A click may be heard or felt in the presence of a tear. Be careful or you can hurt the
patient.

EXAMINATION OF THE
ANKLE AND FOOT

Inspection
Inspect the ankle and foot with the patient in both
resting and weight-bearing positions. Look at the
distribution of any swelling. Synovitis of the ankle
usually produces diffuse swelling, obscuring the
contours of the medial and lateral malleoli. Swelling
in the region of the Achilles tendon is more likely
to be due to Achilles tendinopathy or tendon
rupture.
Disease of the subtalar joint or abnormalities of
the longitudinal arch of the foot may disrupt the
alignment of the heel and Achilles tendon. This
should be vertical and is seen easily from behind
whilst the patient is standing. Pes planus (ﬂat foot)
can cause pronation of the foot and valgus deformity of the heel (Fig. 29.13).

Normal

Abnormal

positive sign. Note that the tibial tuberosity is more
prominent on the left.

Fig. 29.13 Pes planus with pronation of the feet and
hindfoot valgus.

201

Examination of joints
Forefoot problems are common. Hallux valgus is
a deformity of the great toe, which becomes abducted
at the MTP joint. Excessive pressure on the medial
side can lead to formation of a bursa, often referred
to as a ‘bunion’. Figure 29.14 shows some other
deformities that commonly affect the forefoot.
The MTP joints are commonly affected by RA and
may sublux. The metatarsal heads become prominent and callosities often form in the overlying
skin.

Palpation
Palpate the joints of the ankle and foot with the foot
in slight plantar ﬂexion to assess for swelling and
tenderness. Tenderness of the heel may be due to
plantar fasciitis. Tenderness at the insertion of the
Achilles tendon to the calcaneus occurs in Achilles
tendinopathy.

Movement
Test plantar ﬂexion and dorsiﬂexion of the ankle
with the knee ﬂexed. The subtalar joint allows inversion and eversion of the hindfoot. This is tested by
stabilizing the tibia with one hand and turning the
calcaneus inward and outward with the other. Midtarsal movements contribute to plantar ﬂexion, dorsiﬂexion, inversion and eversion. These are tested by
stabilizing the heel with one hand and moving the
forefoot with the other. Movements of the MTP, PIP
and DIP joints are best examined whilst the patient
is lying or sitting.

MTP

EXAMINATION OF THE SPINE
When examining the spine always remember to also
perform a peripheral nervous system examination.

Inspection
In acute conditions muscle spasm and loss of normal
lumbar lordosis may be seen. Look at the posture of
the patient. If the patient has sciatica the affected leg
is often ﬂexed and the patient is stooped.
Note any scars, erythema or deformity. Deformities of the spine such as scoliosis or kyphosis may
be obvious on inspection.
• In scoliosis the rib hump deformity is more
clearly seen when the patient bends forwards
(see Fig. 23.12, p. 170).
• Kyphotic deformity is best visualized from the
side (see Fig. 5.4, p. 36). A gibbus is a very
pronounced kyphotic deformity caused by
fracture, tumour or infection.

Remember the spine normally has a
lumbar and cervical lordosis and a
thoracic kyphosis.

Examination of the spine

Palpation
Palpation is performed standing and with the patient
lying prone.
The C7 spinous process is a useful landmark (the
most prominent in the upper spine).
Tenderness is elicited by palpation over the
spinous processes.

Movement
Cervical spine
Movements of the cervical spine (Fig. 29.15) are
usually stated as percentage loss when compared
with normal, if possible.
Flexion
Ask the patient to bend the head forward to put the
chin on the chest.

29

Rotation
Ask the patient to look to either side.

Thoracolumbar spine (Fig. 29.16)
Flexion
Often patients are reluctant to ﬂex the spine if it is
acutely tender. Ask patients to bend over and reach
as far as they can.
Look and feel for unfolding of the lumbar spine.
This can be measured by marking two points on the
lumbar spine and observing the increase in the distance between them on ﬂexion.
Extension
Get the patient to arch the back backwards. In conditions such as spinal stenosis this can exacerbate the
pain.

Extension
Ask the patient to look up at the ceiling.

Rotation
Stabilize the pelvis by asking the patient to sit
when examining rotation in order to abolish hip
rotation.

Lateral ﬂexion
Ask the patient to put the ear down to the
shoulder.

Lateral ﬂexion
Ask the patient to slide one hand down the side of
the leg.

Special tests
Straight leg raising
Straight leg raising is a test for nerve root irritation
(radiculopathy).
With the patient supine elevate the affected leg
passively keeping it straight. If the patient complains
of pain down the leg look at the angle that the leg
makes with the couch, e.g. 30°. The next step is to
bend the knee as this will abolish the symptoms by
relieving tension on the nerve.
For the test to be positive the pain must radiate
to the foot (often patients will complain of back
pain when elevating the leg).
The crossover sign is present with severe acute
prolapsed discs and occurs when the normal leg is

elevated causing pain radiating down the opposite
leg.
Peripheral nervous examination
Spinal cord conditions such as stenosis or prolapsed
disc can cause abnormalities of the peripheral
nervous system due to compression on nerve roots.
The most commonly affected are the L5 and S1
nerve roots.

Lower limb
Tone
Lower limb tone is usually normal but is reduced in
spinal cord compression (ﬂaccid paralysis).
Power is assessed by Medical Research Council

Reﬂexes
Always compare the reﬂexes with the opposite limb
and make sure the patient is relaxed. Reﬂexes can be
reduced, brisk or absent.
Three reﬂexes are commonly tested:

Sensation
Ask the patient if the sensation is normal and the
same as on the other side. Dermatomes are shown
in Figure 29.18.
Anal tone
In cauda equina syndrome anal tone is lost; therefore an examination per rectum (PR) is an important part of any spinal examination.
Perianal sensation
This is also reduced in cauda equina syndrome.
Chest expansion
Patients with severe scoliosis or ankylosing spondylitis have reduced lung function and may show
reduced chest expansion.

ﬂexed and the leg externally rotated. Tap the
Achilles tendon.
• Plantar: this is performed by stroking the
plantar skin with the handle of the tendon
hammer. If the toes extend this is abnormal
and called ‘up going’, indicating an upper

EXAMINATION OF THE
SHOULDER
Movement of the shoulder occurs at four joints (Fig.
29.19). The majority of the total range of movement
arises from the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic
joints.

Inspection
Look at the position and contours of the shoulder
and compare with the opposite one.

• Swelling of the shoulder is uncommon. When
it does occur, it is best seen anteriorly.
• Muscle wasting may be due to chronic shoulder
pathology, such as chronic rotator cuff
tendinopathy.
• Rupture of the long head of biceps is usually
obvious, as it produces a bulge anteriorly in the
upper arm.
• Look for winging of the scapula by asking the
patient to do a press-up against the wall.
Weakness of the serratus anterior muscle causes
the medial border to protrude backwards. This
can occur in long thoracic nerve palsy or other
causes of muscular weakness.
• Look for a step in the acromioclavicular joint
due to dislocation. This is seen best whilst
the patient’s arm is hanging in a relaxed
position.

Palpation
Feel for tenderness and swelling of the acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular and glenohumeral joints. A
gap on palpation of the acromioclavicular joint
indicates dislocation. Crepitus of the glenohumeral
or acromioclavicular joints may be felt on shoulder
movement. Palpate the muscles of the shoulder
girdle and neck to identify any tender ‘trigger’ points
of ﬁbromyalgia (see Fig. 19.3, p. 140).

206

Movement
Examine active and passive movements, looking at
the range of abduction, forward ﬂexion, and internal
and external rotation.
• A normal range of passive movements suggests
that glenohumeral disease is very unlikely.
• Normal passive movements with painful or
restricted active movements indicate a muscle
or tendon problem.
• A ‘hitch-up’ of the shoulder on active abduction
of the arm is a sign of reduced glenohumeral
range (Fig. 29.20).
• Loss of passive external rotation, and abduction
are highly indicative of adhesive capsulitis
(‘frozen shoulder’).
A quick way to evaluate active shoulder movements
is by asking patients to:
• Put their hands behind their head, with the
elbows back.
• Reach behind their back, as if to fasten a bra
strap.
• Raise their arms up to their sides and then
above their head.

The rotator cuff
The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and
subscapularis muscles make up the rotator cuff.

Examination of the shoulder
They hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid
cavity, maintain stability and initiate shoulder
abduction. Rotator cuff inﬂammation, injury and
degeneration are common. Disease of the supraspinatus especially, causes pain on abduction when the
tendon becomes compressed under the acromion.
The pain is felt at between 60° and 120° of abduc-

29

tion (Fig. 29.21). This is referred to as a ‘painful
arc’.
Resisted shoulder movements should be examined. Pain or weakness on resisted movements suggests involvement of the rotator cuff muscles and
tendons.
• Supraspinatus is tested with the arm abducted
to 30°, ﬂexed to 30° and internally rotated with
the thumb pointing downwards. Abduction is
then resisted.
• Resisted internal rotation tests the
subscapularis.
• Resisted external rotation tests the infraspinatus
and teres minor.

Apprehension testing
An unstable shoulder makes the patient apprehensive when it is put into abduction and external rotation. The patient should be supine with the arms
abducted to 90° and elbows ﬂexed to 90°. Ask the
patient to lower the hands backward (i.e. towards
90° of external rotation). The patient’s apprehension will limit external rotation of a dislocationprone shoulder.

Fig. 29.20 A ‘hitched’ shoulder. The patient is unable to
elevate her arm to the side properly, so is ‘cheating’ by
shrugging her shoulder.

Acromioclavicular joint testing
Pain arising from pathology of the acromioclavicular joint may be accentuated if the patient places the
hand on the opposite shoulder and the examiner
pulls the elbow in the same direction.

OUCH!

207

Examination of joints

EXAMINATION OF THE ELBOW
The elbow joint consists of two articulations:
• The ﬁrst is between the humerus, radius and
ulna, which allows ﬂexion to a range of 150°.
• The second is the superior radioulnar joint,
which allows rotation of the wrist through
180°.

Inspection
Inspect the elbow from behind with the patient’s
arm ﬂexed and extended. The lateral infracondylar
recess will be ﬁlled in if an effusion is present. Look
also for swelling of the olecranon bursa and the
presence of rheumatoid nodules along the border of
the ulna.

Palpation
Palpate the olecranon process and medial and lateral
epicondyles. The lateral epicondyle will be tender in
tennis elbow. The radial head is usually felt easily in
the lateral aspect of the joint and its movement can
be assessed during pronation and supination.

Movement
Test ﬂexion, extension, pronation and supination.
Extension of the elbow is to 180° or beyond in
almost all normal people. The inability to straighten
the elbow to 180° is therefore considered pathological, even if it is pain-free and unnoticed by the
patient. It will usually be a sign of arthritis. On the
other hand, many people can extend another 5–10°,
so hyperextension (as in hypermobility) is deﬁned
as extension beyond 190°.
It is best to assess pronation and supination with
the elbow ﬂexed to 90° and held close to the side of
the body. If you suspect the patient may have epicondylitis, examine resisted movements of the wrist
for pain (see Fig. 26.1, p. 186).

EXAMINATION OF THE WRIST
AND HAND

Inspection
Inspection of the hands is an important part of the
musculoskeletal examination. Look ﬁrst at the skin
and the nails.

208

• Pitting of the nails or onycholysis is commonly
found in psoriatic arthritis.
• Nail fold infarcts and digital ulcers can occur as
a consequence of vasculitis. A magnifying glass
is useful when looking for nail fold infarcts.
• Telangiectasia and sclerodactyly are features of
systemic sclerosis.
• Heberden’s nodes, gouty tophi or rheumatoid
nodules may develop in the ﬁngers.
Look next for deformities, which are common in
inﬂammatory arthritis. Arthritis mutilans is a rare,
but severe type of joint destruction in psoriatic
arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause many
deformities in the hand and wrist, including:
• Volar subluxation and radial deviation of the
carpus.
• Boutonnière and swan-neck deformities of the
ﬁngers (see Fig. 10.9, p. 62).
• Z-deformity of the thumb.
Look carefully for swelling. The distribution gives a
good clue to the cause. For example, swelling of the
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints is common in RA, whereas
distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint involvement is
more typical of osteoarthritis (OA) or psoriatic
arthritis. The swelling of tenosynovitis follows the
route of the tendon.
It is also important to note any muscle wasting.
Atrophy of the dorsal interossei occurs in RA. Carpal
tunnel syndrome can lead to wasting of the muscles
of the thenar eminence.

Palpation
Palpate any swellings to conﬁrm whether they are
hard due to bony overgrowth, or soft due to synovitis. Synovitis at the MCP joints is best felt with the
patient’s ﬁngers semi-ﬂexed and the examiner’s ﬁngertips placed at either side of the MCP joint, feeling
for soft tissue swelling. With practice, it is easily
detected, even in podgy hands. Synovitis at the PIP
joint bulges out either side of the extensor expansion. Enthesitis at the DIP joint due to psoriatic
arthritis is to be distinguished from Heberden’s
nodes; this is not always easy. Crepitus may be felt
on palpation of the ﬁrst carpometacarpal (CMC)
joint in OA. Tenosynovitis of the ﬁnger ﬂexors can
be associated with tendon nodules, which can be
felt moving on ﬁnger ﬂexion.

hand and wrist movement.

Movement
It is important to assess hand function. Active and
passive movement of the wrist and digits should be
tested, as well as the patient’s ability to perform
certain tasks. The muscles responsible for various
movements of the hand and wrist are shown in
Figure 29.22.
The ‘prayer’ sign is useful when assessing hand
and wrist function. Ask the patient to extend both
wrists and place the palms of the hands ﬂat against
each other, as if praying (Fig. 29.23). Patients with
limited wrist extension or deformities or synovitis
of their MCP or PIP joints will ﬁnd this difﬁcult.

Fig. 29.23 The ‘prayer’ sign.

Special tests
Ask the patient to pick a penny up from
the table or fasten a button. This will
give you a good idea of what their hand
function is like. It is surprising how well some
people can perform ﬁddly tasks, despite having
hand deformities.

Tinel’s and Phalen’s tests should be performed in
patients who have symptoms suggestive of carpal
tunnel syndrome. These tests are described in
Chapter 25.

Writing up a
medical clerking

30

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the importance of clear and accurate documentation in the medical
notes.
• Write up your medical clerking in a methodical and organized format.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with musculoskeletal problems usually
present to hospital in one of two ways. Many are
referred to the outpatient department by their family
doctors. Those with more urgent problems attend
the accident and emergency department.
The doctor clerking the patient should record the
history and examination in the medical notes. Clear
documentation will remind the doctor of the
patient’s problems and is valuable for other clinicians involved in their care. Good record keeping is
also extremely important for medicolegal reasons.

PRESENTATION
Notes should be legible, easily understood and
neatly ﬁled. Only well-recognized abbreviations
should be used. Diagrams may be helpful, particularly to illustrate examination ﬁndings, such as
swellings, scars or rashes.

CONTENT

The patient’s name and hospital number
should be written on every page of the
notes.

The date, time and place of the consultation should
be recorded, followed by the details of the history
and examination ﬁndings. Negative answers in the
history and normal examination ﬁndings can be as
helpful as positive ones in formulating a diagnosis.
The investigations requested should be listed, as
should the results when they arrive. A clear management plan should include details of all intended
interventions. Every entry made in a patient’s
medical notes should ﬁnish with the doctor’s signature, followed by his/her name, grade and bleep
number.

Investigations

31

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand which general and speciﬁc blood tests are useful for various orthopaedic
and rheumatological conditions.
• Describe what tests can be done on a joint ﬂuid aspirate to help make a diagnosis.
• Describe some tests useful in the diagnosis of neuromuscular conditions.
• Describe common tests used to diagnose osteoporosis and understand the
difference between an isotope and a DEXA bone scan.
• Understand the different uses and indications for X-ray imaging, CT and MRI.

BLOOD TESTS
The following blood tests are useful in the investigation of rheumatic disease.

Full blood count
• Anaemia may be due to chronic inﬂammatory
disease or iron deﬁciency from non-steroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) therapy.
• A polymorphonuclear leucocytosis may be a
consequence of infection, such as septic
arthritis or osteomyelitis. It can also be a
sign of inﬂammation or prolonged
corticosteroid use.
• Leucopenia can be a feature of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) or bone marrow
suppression from disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
• Thrombocytosis often occurs in active
inﬂammatory disease. It is sometimes referred
to as a ‘reactive thrombocytosis’.

Erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP)
• These are non-speciﬁc markers of inﬂammation
and will rise in infectious and inﬂammatory
disorders.
• The ESR measures aggregation of erythrocytes,
which increases with the concentration of
plasma proteins such as ﬁbrinogen and
immunoglobulins.
• The upper limit of normal for the ESR increases
with age.
• CRP is synthesized by the liver and rises within
6–10 hours of an inﬂammatory event.

The CRP responds more rapidly than the
ESR to inﬂammation.

Urea and electrolytes (U&E)
Renal impairment might occur in gout or connective
tissue disease.
Chronic inﬂammatory disease can cause
anaemia, but the haemoglobin rarely
drops below 9 g/dL.

Liver function tests (LFTs)
• A raised level of alkaline phosphatase is seen in
Paget’s disease.

215

Investigations
• Many drugs used for musculoskeletal problems
can be hepatotoxic, such as methotrexate and
NSAIDs.

Uric acid
• Prolonged hyperuricaemia predisposes to gout.
• Occasionally, uric acid levels are normal during
an acute attack of gout.

Calcium
• Hypocalcaemia occurs in osteomalacia.
• Hypercalcaemia can be a feature of malignancy.

Creatine kinase (CK)
• This muscle enzyme exists as three isoenzymes
(CK-MM, CK-MB and CK-BB).
• Elevated levels of CK-MM may be due to
myositis or other causes of skeletal muscle
damage.
• CK-BB is found in the brain and CK-MB in the
myocardium.

Autoantibodies
These are found in many autoimmune rheumatic
diseases. Medical students and doctors often ﬁnd
the results of autoantibody tests difﬁcult to interpret, usually because they have been requested inappropriately. Some autoantibodies can occur in
healthy people and tests for them have little diagnostic value unless they are done in appropriate
circumstances.

Example
An elderly man visits his doctor complaining of pain
in his knees that is worse in the evenings and has
been present for several years. On examination, he
has bilateral knee crepitus, without swelling, and
Heberden’s and Bouchard’s nodes in his hands. His
family doctor requests several investigations, including a test for rheumatoid factor, which is positive.
There is now confusion as to the correct diagnosis.
Does this man have osteoarthritis or rheumatoid
arthritis?
The correct diagnosis is osteoarthritis. This man
has no clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis. The
prevalence of rheumatoid factor in the ‘normal’
population is at least 1% and this increases with age.
The presence of rheumatoid factor in this case has
no relevance.

216

Autoantibody tests should only be
requested if there is real clinical suspicion
of an autoimmune disease.

Rheumatoid factor
The deﬁnition of a rheumatoid factor is an antibody
directed against the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G (IgG). Rheumatoid factors may be of
any immunoglobulin class, although IgM anti-IgG
is the rheumatoid factor that is most commonly
measured. Patients who are rheumatoid factor-positive tend to have more aggressive disease.

Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (antiCCP) antibodies
These antibodies are highly speciﬁc for RA and may
be detected years before onset of the disease. They
are associated with joint destruction and can
be present in patients who are rheumatoid
factor-negative.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)
These are antibodies to nuclear antigens. They are
detected by labelling methods, such as indirect
immunoﬂuorescence. A positive ANA simply indicates that the patient’s blood contains antibodies,
which will bind to the nuclei of a sample of cells
used in the test.
If an ANA test is positive, it is important to
examine which nuclear antigens the antibodies are
binding to. The pattern of ﬂuorescence gives a clue.
ANAs are found in 5–10% of the normal population
and 95% of SLE patients. They are also seen in other
connective tissue diseases.
Figure 31.1 lists the ANAs against speciﬁc nuclear
antigens and the diseases with which they are
associated.
Antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are
very speciﬁc for SLE. They are also useful measures
of disease activity.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic
antibodies (ANCA)
These antibodies are directed against enzymes
present in neutrophil granules. Two main patterns

of immunoﬂuorescence are seen: cytoplasmic (c-)
and perinuclear (p-).
c-ANCA and p-ANCA bind to several proteins, the
most common being proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase, respectively. Antibodies to proteinase 3 are
found in about 80% of patients with Wegener’s
granulomatosis. Those against myeloperoxidase are
found in polyarteritis nodosa and rheumatoid and
lupus vasculitis. A positive p-ANCA can also be
found with malignancy and certain infections.

Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs)
Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies
are found in the antiphospholipid syndrome.
They are associated with venous and arterial
thrombosis.

SYNOVIAL FLUID ANALYSIS
This is the most important investigation for suspected septic or crystal arthritis. Synovial ﬂuid can
be aspirated from most peripheral joints and only a
small amount is needed for analysis.

Macroscopic appearance
Normal synovial ﬂuid is pale yellow and clear.
Changes in the macroscopic appearance can give
clues to the underlying joint pathology (Fig. 31.2).

Gram stain and culture
This should be performed if there is any suspicion
of septic arthritis. The absence of organisms on
microscopy does not exclude infection.

Polarized light microscopy
For accurate identiﬁcation of crystals, synovial ﬂuid
should be examined under a polarized light microscope. Urate crystals are needle-shaped and show
strong negative birefringence. This means that crystals parallel to the plane of light appear yellow,
whereas those at right angles are blue. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals are either
rhomboid or rod-shaped and show weak positive
birefringence.

NERVE CONDUCTION
STUDIES (NCS) AND
ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG)
These electrophysiological tests are used to diagnose
and assess neuromuscular problems. They help to
differentiate between primary muscle disease and
neuropathic disorders. NCS measure the conduction
velocity of motor and sensory nerves and can localize and assess the severity of peripheral nerve lesions.
EMG records the spontaneous and voluntary electrical activity of muscle.

BIOPSY
Biopsies are occasionally performed in the investigation of musculoskeletal disease. Muscle is biopsied
in cases of suspected myositis. Evidence of vasculitis
can be obtained from biopsy of blood vessels, nerves
and skin. Renal biopsies can assess the extent of

217

renal involvement in connective tissue diseases and

diagnosis of primary bone tumours.

IMAGING

X-rays
A plain X-ray (radiograph) is usually the ﬁrst-line
investigation of any musculoskeletal disease. X-rays
are good at visualizing bone. Soft tissues can also be
seen on X-ray and give valuable information (for
example a lipohaemarthrosis in the knee) but for
detail of ligamentous or cartilage structures other
investigations are necessary.
A radiograph involves the use of electromagnetic
radiation produced by electrons striking a rotating
metal target in an X-ray tube. A narrow beam of
X-rays is produced, which then passes through
the patient, and the image is formed on an Xray-sensitive ﬁlm placed behind the patient (Fig.
31.3).
The amount of the X-ray beam absorbed by the
tissues determines the overall appearance of the
image. Bone absorbs the most and appears white on
the image, muscle absorbs some and appears dark
grey, fat is darker grey and air appears black (see Fig.
1.8).
The X-ray machine is controlled by a radiographer who will determine the amount of exposure
and the correct position of the patient.

Fig. 31.3 Production of a radiographic image.

Fluoroscopy (also known as screening) uses the
same principles as radiography but the image is
obtained on a screen and is in real time (i.e. moving).
Screening is commonly used intraoperatively in
orthopaedic surgery when ﬁxing fractures and as
guidance for joint injections.

Ultrasound
Any X-ray causes a small radiation
exposure. This effect is cumulative and
has been linked with the development of
tumours. Avoid unnecessary X-rays to minimize risk.
Avoid X-rays in pregnancy unless absolutely
necessary.

Two views are required, taken at 90° to each
other, of the joint or bone to be examined (usually
anteroposterior (AP) and lateral). Sometimes special
views are taken, such as scaphoid views when
looking for a fracture.

218

Ultrasound is used widely in orthopaedics and has
the advantages of being cheap, portable and safe,
and it allows dynamic images.
The image is produced using a transducer that
emits a beam of high-frequency sound (ultrasound)
and detects the sound waves reﬂected from the soft
tissues of the patient. Different tissues absorb or
reﬂect different amounts of the sound beam, and
the reﬂections are analysed to produce a black and
white image.
Areas commonly imaged in this way include the
shoulder for rotator cuff tears, the hip for joint effusion, and extra-articular structures around the knee
such as the patellar tendon.
Ultrasound can also be used for guidance, for
example for joint aspiration.

Imaging

Computed tomography (CT)
CT uses the basic principles of an X-ray machine but
the image is obtained when the X-ray tube is circled
around the patient in the scanner. Instead of an Xray plate the CT scanner has detectors within the
machine to collect images. A large number of images
are acquired and processed by the computer and the
resulting images are in the form of cross-sectional
slices taken in different planes.
The main role for CT in orthopaedics is the study
of bones, particularly complex fractures.
Remember that CT scans also produce a signiﬁcant radiation exposure.
It is also possible to reconstruct images in three
dimensions. Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions are useful in orthopaedics when planning
complex pelvic or hip surgery.

Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)
MRI gives excellent images of soft tissues and bone
marrow.
The images are generated by the use of a powerful
magnet, which aligns protons in the body with the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. A pulse of radiofrequency
energy then causes the protons to ‘ﬂip’ (change

31

alignment) and images are acquired when energy is
released as the protons realign themselves within
the magnetic ﬁeld. A coil collects data, which are
then reconstructed with complex computer software
to produce the image.
As a large magnet is used, any metal components
or foreign bodies may become dislodged. Patients
with cardiac pacemakers and intraocular metallic
foreign bodies must not have an MRI scan.
MRI is commonly used around the knee to look
for meniscal or ligamentous injuries (Fig. 31.4),
the shoulder for capsule or rotator cuff lesions,
and the spine for disc prolapse and nerve root
compression.
MRI is also good at assessing bone changes such
as in infection, tumour and osteonecrosis.

Isotope bone scan
An isotope bone scan involves the use of a radioactive tracer injected intravenously and taken up by
physiologically active bone. The most commonly
used is technetium-99m (99mTc) and its decay is
measured with a gamma camera. The procedure is
divided into three phases depending on the time
after injection: blood ﬂow (initial); blood pool (30
minutes); and delayed (4 hours).

B

219

Investigations
The images obtained show an outline of the body
with areas highlighted where the isotope has
accumulated.
Bone scans are useful as a tool for identifying the
presence of a disease process (sensitive) but not very
good at telling you exactly what the disease is (nonspeciﬁc). Increased uptake occurs typically in growth
plates, arthritis, fractures, metastases (commonly
used in malignancy), infection and Paget’s disease.
Decreased uptake occurs in some tumours (haemopoietic) and also in avascular bone.

Measurement of bone
mineral density
Bone mineral density is usually measured at the
lumbar spine, femoral neck or wrist. There are
several current methods in use for measurement.
These include:
• Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
• Quantitative computed tomography (QCT).
• Broad-band ultrasound attenuation (BUA).

220

Bone density is expressed in relation to a young
adult mean.
• Osteoporosis is deﬁned as bone mineral density
of greater than 2.5 standard deviations below
the mean.
• Osteopenia is deﬁned as bone mineral density
of between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below
the mean.

Arthrography
Arthrograms are investigations in which the patient
also has contrast or air injected into the joint. Plain
X-ray arthrograms have largely been superseded by
other investigations but are still used for hip conditions in the child. CT and MRI arthrograms are now
becoming widespread for the diagnosis of intraarticular pathology, particularly in the shoulder,
such as a Bankart lesion.

Instruction: You are examining the right hand of
the patients below. Look at the description of the
clinical ﬁndings and choose the most appropriate
diagnosis from the list above.
1. The muscles of the hypothenar eminence
are wasted. Abduction and adduction of
the ﬁngers is weak. Sensation over the
little ﬁnger is reduced.
2. There is pitting of the ﬁngernails. On
palpation of the distal interphalangeal
(DIP) joints of the middle and ring ﬁngers,
there is tender, boggy swelling. The whole
length of the index ﬁnger is swollen and
tender.
3. There is mild generalized swelling of the
hand. The skin is pale, cool and extremely
hypersensitive, to the extent that light touch
produces severe pain. The radial and ulnar
pulses are easily palpable.
4. When the patient opens his ﬁst to extend
his ﬁngers, the middle ﬁnger responds more
slowly than the others. In order to fully
straighten the digit, the patient has to pull
it with his other hand. The palm at the
base of the ﬁnger feels lumpy.
5. There is bony swelling of all the DIP joints
and the base of the thumb. Crepitus can
be felt on movements of the thumb.

10. The foot is plantar ﬂexed and inverted (‘foot drop’).
The patient takes high steps, ﬂicking the foot
forwards to avoid tripping over it. The common
peroneal nerve is most vulnerable to injury where it
winds around the neck of the ﬁbula.

Chronic disease.
Autoimmune haemolysis.
Felty’s syndrome.
Iron deﬁciency secondary to gastrointestinal
blood loss from non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs).
• Bone marrow suppression secondary to diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

2. The history is suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis.
Plain X-rays of the patient’s lumbar spine and pelvis
should be requested. There may be sclerosis of the
sacroiliac joints and squaring of the vertebral bodies,
with or without syndesmophyte formation. A full
blood count may reveal a mild anaemia and the
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) will be raised during active disease.

6. An ophthalmologist should examine the child’s eyes
with a slit-lamp to look for signs of chronic anterior
uveitis. She has oligoarticular JIA and a positive
ANA, which means she has a signiﬁcant risk of
developing eye disease.

• Arterial and venous thrombosis.
• Recurrent fetal loss.
• Thrombocytopenia.

Orthopaedics
1. Any postoperative complications can be:
• Immediate (within hours).
• Early (days).
• Late (months).
and:
• Local (i.e. related to that speciﬁc operation).
• General (simply because the patient is having an
operation).
Any system can be affected by postoperative
complications:
• Respiratory: e.g. chest infection.
• Cardiovascular: e.g. left ventricular failure (LVF)
or myocardial infarction (MI).
• Gastrointestinal (GI): ileus or upper GI bleeding.
• Genitourinary: urinary retention.
• Skin: pressure sores.
2. Elderly people fall because of:
• Intrinsic factors:
— Acute medical conditions: e.g. cerebrovascular
accident (CVA), transient ischaemic attack
(TIA), atrial ﬁbrillation (AF)
— Diminished senses: e.g. poor eyesight
— Reduced reﬂexes: ageing produces an inability
to recover from a slight stumble increasing
falls
— Poor mobility: e.g. arthritis or previous CVA.
• Extrinsic factors:
— Poor housing
— Lack of social services.
When elderly people do fall the three typical
osteoporotic fractures are:
1. Spine.
2. Wrist.
3. Hip.

8. A history of scalp tenderness, jaw claudication or
visual disturbance raises suspicion of giant cell
arteritis. Approximately 50% of patients have
symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica, so pain and
stiffness in the shoulder and pelvic girdles are also
suggestive.

265

SAQ answers
3. Osteoporosis results from an imbalance of
osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. If the
osteoclasts remove more bone than is being laid
down by the osteoblasts then a net loss of bone
results. The bony trabeculae become thinner with a
decreased number of connections.
Risk factors for developing osteoporosis include:
• Age.
• Female sex.
• Family history.
• Small size.
• Caucasian race.
• Early menopause.
• Smoking.
• Alcoholism.
• Lack of weight-bearing activity.
4. The X-ray features of osteoarthritis (OA) are:
• Decreased joint space.
• Subchondral sclerosis.
• Cysts.
• Osteophytes.
Treatment options available for OA can be
conservative or operative.
• Conservative: weight loss, modiﬁcation of
activity, analgesia, non-steroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physiotherapy,
glucosamine, steroid injections.
• Operative: debridement and washout, fusion,
joint excision, osteotomy, joint replacement.
5. Features in the history of an anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL) rupture are as follows. Usually the
patient is a young adult involved in sporting activity
or skiing. A twisting injury or valgus force is usually
reported; the patient may feel or hear a ‘pop’ and
swelling is rapid. Once the initial injury has settled
the patient will complain of the knee ‘giving way’,
particularly on turning.
Initial examination may be difﬁcult due to pain but
a large effusion is typical.
The anterior drawer, Lachman’s and pivot shift
tests are positive in ACL rupture.
6. Features suggestive of malignancy are:
• Cortical destruction.
• A poorly deﬁned zone of transition.
• Periosteal reaction (Codman’s triangle).
• Sunray spicules.
• Onion skinning.
Possible causes of malignancy presenting in bone:
1. Metastatic bone tumours: from breast, lung,
prostate, kidney, thyroid.
2. Primary bone tumours: osteosarcoma, Ewing’s
sarcoma, chondrosarcoma.
3. Haemopoietic disorders: myeloma, lymphoma,
leukaemia.

Features in the history, examination, and
investigations are as follows:
• History:
— In musculoskeletal back pain the pain is a dull
ache across the back with some radiation to
the thighs.
— A prolapsed disc causes severe sharp shooting
leg pain. Back pain may be a secondary
feature.
• Examination:
— In a patient with musculoskeletal back pain
there are few positive signs on examination
apart from reduced range of movement
(ROM).
— A patient with disc prolapse which is
compressing a nerve root will have a
diminished straight leg raise with positive
nerve root tension signs. Lower limb
neurological examination may show weakness
with diminished sensation in a dermatomal
distribution.
• Investigation:
— Most patients with back pain do not need
further investigation.
— An MRI will show a prolapsed disc.

8. Aspiration should be performed for any hot swollen
joint to exclude septic arthritis.
The differential diagnosis includes:
• Septic arthritis.
• Crystal arthritis (gout, pseudogout).
• Inﬂammatory arthritis (including Reiter’s
syndrome).
• Haemarthrosis.
9. Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis usually occurs
in children.
1. There may be a history of minor trauma.
2. A bacteraemia settles in the metaphysis of a long
bone, which is susceptible due to its blood
supply and lack of phagocytes.
3. Bacteria multiply and an abscess forms.
4. If pus escapes through small holes in bone
(haversian canals) a periosteal abscess is formed.
5. Pus is now present on both sides of the bone,
causing this part of the bone to die.
6. Dead bone now called the sequestrum harbours
infection.
7. Periosteal new bone called involucrum forms as
the body tries to ﬁght the infection.
8. If dead bone is present this needs to be removed
to cure the infection.

10. Think of diagnosis by age of child. Infection can
present at any age. Also remember occult trauma,
particularly non-accidental injury.
• Infant (always exclude infection):
— Transient synovitis
— Irritable hip
— Developmental dysplasia of the hip.
• Child:
— Irritable hip
— Perthes disease
— Juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

• Adolescent:
— Hip disorders: slipped upper femoral epiphysis
(SUFE)
— Knee disorders: Osgood–Schlatter disease;
osteochondritis dissecans
— General disorders: juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Ulnar nerve palsy. The ulnar nerve supplies
the muscles of the hypothenar eminence,
including the interossei, which are
responsible for ﬁnger abduction and
adduction. See Figure 25.2 (p. 182) for
the sensory distribution of the ulnar nerve
in the hand.
Psoriatic arthropathy. The patient has
inﬂammatory arthritis affecting the DIP
joints and causing a dactylitis of the
index ﬁnger. This is typical of a
spondyloarthropathy. The nail changes are
suggestive of psoriasis.
Complex regional pain syndrome. These
are classical signs of complex regional pain
syndrome. The skin may undergo dramatic
colour changes from white to purple, and
growth of hair and nails may be affected.
Trigger ﬁnger. This results from
tenosynovitis of the ﬂexor tendon.
Osteoarthritis. The ﬁrst carpometacarpal
(CMC) joint and DIP joints are classical
sites for OA. The bony swellings of the
DIP joints are called ‘Heberden’s nodes’.

Kawasaki’s disease. This is a rare form of
vasculitis that predominantly affects young
children. Other clinical features include
conjunctival congestion and coronary arteritis,
which can lead to acute myocardial infarction.
Systemic sclerosis. This woman describes the
early changes of scleroderma in her hands.
She also has Raynaud’s phenomenon,
symptoms of oesophageal involvement and
telangiectasia, which are all features of limited
systemic sclerosis.
Wegener’s granulomatosis. This is a small
vessel vasculitis that had a very high mortality
rate before the introduction of
cyclophosphamide. This patient has had a
life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage.
Renal complications can also be very serious.
Please see Figure 12.19 (p. 92) for details of
other clinical features of Wegener’s
granulomatosis.
Polymyositis. This painless, symmetrical
proximal myopathy is consistent with
polymyositis. Polymyalgia rheumatica causes
proximal pain and stiffness, so is less likely.
Primary Sjögren’s syndrome. Dryness of the
eyes and mouth, arthralgia and positive antiRo and anti-La antibodies are all features of
Sjögren’s syndrome.

Synovial ﬂuid aspiration, Gram stain and
culture. This woman has septic arthritis
until proven otherwise. Her risk factors for
this include rheumatoid arthritis and
corticosteroid therapy.
Measurement of lupus anticoagulant and
anticardiolipin antibodies. The patient’s
venous thromboembolism, recurrent
miscarriages and migraine may well be
manifestations of the antiphospholipid
antibody syndrome.
Temporal artery biopsy. The symptoms are
suggestive of giant cell arteritis, and a
temporal artery biopsy is the investigation
of choice. The patient’s ESR is likely to be
high, but this is a non-speciﬁc rather than
a diagnostic ﬁnding.
Nerve conduction studies and
electromyography. These are classical
symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Synovial ﬂuid aspiration, Gram stain and
culture. The ﬁrst and most important step
is to exclude septic arthritis in this man. It
would be dangerous to assume that this is
just another attack of gout.

Rotator cuff tendinitis. The site of the pain is
typical of a rotator cuff problem. Passive
movements of the joint are full, making
glenohumeral arthritis or capsulitis unlikely. A
painful arc is often seen with supraspinatus
tendinitis.
Acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac pain is
often referred to the shoulder and is not
always felt in the anterior chest. This man’s
pain is unaffected by movements of the joint,
making a musculoskeletal cause less likely. He
is diabetic, so has at least one risk factor for
ischaemic heart disease. The sweating and
shortness of breath are common symptoms of
cardiac ischaemia.
Ruptured long head of biceps. This is more
common in the elderly and may follow only
minimal trauma. It is painless and produces a
bulge anteriorly in the upper arm.
Polymyalgia rheumatica. This patient is elderly
and has proximal pain in both her shoulder
and pelvic girdles, associated with stiffness
and weakness. These symptoms are
consistent with PMR, a diagnosis which is
supported by the raised ESR.
Pancoast tumour. A Pancoast tumour is a
carcinoma of the lung that invades the
brachial plexus, causing pain in the upper
limb. This man has chronic lung disease and
is likely to be a smoker. The fact that his pain
continues through the night and is
unresponsive to analgesia raises the suspicion
of malignancy. Weight loss and haemoptysis
are both symptoms seen with lung carcinoma.

The level of pain is suspicious but it is the Xray features that give away the diagnosis.
Myeloma. The fracture under normal loads

skull lesions.
Osteochondroma. The history is benign, of
mild discomfort over long periods, and the Xray appearance is typical of a benign lesion,

Posterior cruciate ligament rupture. The
history is typical with a backwardly directed
force on the tibia. The posterior sag is
pathognomonic for PCL rupture.
Medial collateral sprain. The history suggests
medial ligament sprain and the fact that she
could bear weight afterwards suggests a less
serious injury. Tenderness at the joint line
would be the meniscus but above is more
likely to be medial collateral. The absence of
an effusion excludes an anterior cruciate
ligament rupture.
Osteoarthritis. The history is typical for OA
with gradually increasing pain, a varus
deformity and crepitus.
Anterior cruciate ligament rupture. The
history of a skiing injury and the patient
hearing a pop or feeling something go is
typical. The presence of an effusion makes it
more likely. Often knees such as these are
difﬁcult to examine initially but later will have
positive Lachmann’s and pivot shift tests.
Medial meniscal tear. The history of twisting
injury, things settling but persistent niggling
symptoms is typical. Joint line tenderness and
an effusion also suggest meniscal injury.
Patellar tendon rupture. In this case the
history is not helpful but examination ﬁndings
of loss of straight leg raise with swelling and
tenderness below the patella give the
diagnosis.

Paget’s disease. The abnormal bony
architecture and high alkaline phosphatase
give the diagnosis.
Rickets. The history is typical for rickets, as
are the clinical and X-ray features.
Osteoporosis, presenting with vertebral
fractures. The history with deformity and Xray features all point to osteoporotic vertebral
fractures. The normal blood tests exclude
pathological causes of fractures.
Leukaemia. The history of prolonged illness
with aches and pains suggests a generalized
disorder. The low WCC is also suggestive of a
haematological disorder and a sterile hip
washout makes septic arthritis very unlikely.
Leukaemia does occasionally present with
musculoskeletal symptoms.
Osteogenesis imperfecta. The history of
‘spontaneous’ or low-violence fractures is
typical. These cases are often initially
diagnosed as non-accidental injury but here
the X-ray shows abnormal bone.
Osteoid osteoma. The history is typical with
intense pain relieved by NSAIDs. The X-ray
and CT ﬁnding are typical.

Osteoarthritis of the ﬁrst MTP joint (hallux
rigidus). The pain in the toe-off stage is
typical as the patient has lost extension.
Walking boots can relieve the pain by
minimizing this movement. Clinical features
are typical of OA anywhere, with osteophytes
(dorsal bump) and crepitus.
Reiter’s syndrome. A syndrome of arthritis,
conjunctivitis and urethritis. It is more
common in men but does occur in women.
Psoriatic arthropathy. Commonly affects the
hands which can be signiﬁcantly deformed.
Septic arthritis. Can be a difﬁcult diagnosis to
make in the elderly. Her raised WCC and
temperature point to an infective cause.
Gout. Typical history and the usual joint. The
serum uric acid is often normal during an
acute episode.
Ankylosing spondylitis. The condition tends to
present in early adult life and the spine is
commonly affected and stiffens, eventually
ankylosing. The sacroiliac joints are commonly
involved.

Spinal stenosis. The history is typical and pain
is often worse on extension. The X-ray often
only shows osteoarthritis and a CT or MRI
scan will conﬁrm the presence of spinal
stenosis.
Spinal metastases. The history sounds sinister,
with unrelenting pain. The X-ray showing loss
of the pedicle (winking owl) means bony
destruction by tumour.
Discitis. Often this condition presents late
after the patient has had a number of normal
investigations. This patient is at risk of sepsis,
having diabetes and chronic renal failure. The
X-ray shows the typical features of longstanding discitis.
Cauda equina syndrome. This is a typical
history. Bilateral symptoms are suspicious.
Any patient with sciatica and new urinary or
bowel disturbance should be investigated
urgently.
Acute low back pain. Very common and
usually resolves. Note the absence of leg
pain.
Spondylolisthesis. Fast bowlers in cricket are

Developmental dysplasia of the hip. Latepresenting DDH presents with a painless limp
and leg length discrepancy. All the other
conditions on the list will present with pain.
Slipped upper femoral epiphysis. The patient
is the correct age and the history of pain is
typical. The femoral head in SUFE rotates
posteriorly and leaves an externally rotated
leg. The frog lateral X-ray shows the slip
more obviously than the AP X-ray.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Presentation with
a monoarthritis is common, with other joints
involved later. Generalized symptoms suggest
a systemic disorder. The presence of eye
symptoms is worrying as blindness can result.
Osgood–Schlatter disease. The disease is
often bilateral and occurs during the
adolescent years. Tender swollen tibial
tuberosities are present bilaterally.
Perthes disease. The boy is the right age to
have Perthes and the history of knee pain is
typical. The loss of abduction is worrying as it
could mean impending joint subluxation. The
sclerosis of the femoral head is due to
avascular necrosis.
Osteomyelitis. Diagnosis is difﬁcult in the very
young child. In this case the child obviously
has an infection. In the absence of an
obviously swollen joint and with a normal hip
ultrasound scan the most likely cause is
osteomyelitis.

Tension pneumothorax.This occurs after
trauma creates a one-way valve in the lung
or chest wall. This means that air ﬂows into
the chest cavity, but not out again, which
collapses the lung causing hypoxia. The
mediastinum is displaced to one side, which
reduces venous return to the heart and
therefore cardiac output. This causes
hypotension. This is life threatening and
requires immediate decompression with a
large-bore needle (before a chest X-ray is
sought!), followed by insertion of a chest
drain.

6. G

Pelvic fracture. The mechanism here suggests
that this poor man has had a heavy crush
injury to his pelvis. Venous bleeding can be
massive with pelvic fractures, and can even
be fatal. The man’s hypotension and
tachycardia are signs of hypovolaemic shock.
Associated bladder and urethral injuries are
not uncommon, and this man may have
either a ruptured bladder or a urethral tear,
which would explain the blood at his urethral
meatus, and inability to pass urine. He should
have a retrograde urethrogram before
attempted catheterization.
Lumbar spine fracture/dislocation. This is a
high energy injury, and the lumbar spine
fracture dislocation is associated in this case
with transection of the spinal cord. Therefore
there is no function below the level of the
injury, including nerves to the legs and sacral
nerves to the bladder and bowel. The
prognosis in this case is very poor.
Wedge fracture lumbar spine. This is likely to
be an osteoporotic wedge fracture. This is a
low energy fracture. It is also important to
consider other pathological causes such as
myeloma or bone metastasis from a primary
malignancy.
Unfortunately the doctor has missed the
diagnosis of a C7 fracture. This is because the
X-rays did not show the whole of the cervical
spine. Adequate trauma X-rays for neck
injuries are an AP and lateral showing C1 to
the top of the ﬁrst thoracic vertebrae and an
odontoid peg view. This patient has a
potentially unstable fracture from a signiﬁcant
hyperﬂexion injury, and there is now
compression of the right 8th cervical nerve
root (learn dermatomes!).
This is a classic case of a neck sprain. The
damage to the car suggests that this is a low
speed crash, and the delayed onset of pain is
crucial in making the diagnosis. Patients with
signiﬁcant neck injuries (fractures or ligament
tears) develop immediate pain. A neck sprain
requires simple analgesia and neck exercises
to prevent more stiffness from developing.

Realignment surgery. This man is developing
medial compartment osteoarthritis in his knee
because of his varus deformity. This results in
increased load through the medial part of the
knee joint and therefore earlier wear. He is
too young for a joint replacement but
realignment surgery will correct his deformity
so that there is less wear on the medial side.
This will hopefully slow down the progression
of his osteoarthritis, but he may require a
joint replacement when he is at a suitable
age.
Arthroscopy. This man has a locked knee
secondary to a medial meniscal tear. The
meniscus can get trapped in the joint and
tears as the knee extends. The meniscus is
not very vascular and therefore the bleeding
is slow and swelling occurs over 24 hours. An
arthroscopy will identify the tear and it can
then either be repaired or excised.
Unicompartmental knee replacement. This
man has developed medial joint line
osteoarthritis but his knee is otherwise well
preserved. A unicompartmental knee
replacement is designed to treat just the
affected area of the knee. Its advantage over
a total knee replacement is that it is a smaller
operation and has a shorter recovery time.
X-ray of the spine. The doctor has not
properly examined this lady. The X-ray
changes of the hip are very mild and would
not explain the severe pain that this lady
complains of. Numbness is more typical of
neurological pathology, and the fact that the
hip has a good range of movement rules out
major hip arthritis. This is more likely to be
referred pain from the spine and plain X-ray
may show degenerative change. Doing a hip
replacement in this woman could be
disastrous as it is a big operation and would
not treat the pain.
Total knee replacement. This man has had a
physical job for many years which has
resulted in severe osteoarthritis of the knee.
He cannot cope with his symptoms and
further conservative treatment is not going to
help. He should beneﬁt from a total knee
replacement.

Epidural anaesthesia. The effect of this can
last several hours (numb legs) and peripheral
vasodilation causes pooling of ﬂuid in the legs
which results in hypotension. Other causes of
course must be sought before it is assumed
that the cause of hypotension is the epidural,
but all other parameters are normal in this
case.
Sepsis. This man is in septic shock and
requires an emergency hip washout to treat
his septic hip. He has risk factors for infection
including type 2 diabetes mellitus and steroid
treatment (immunosuppression).
Neurogenic shock. This man appears to have
an isolated spinal injury based on his initial
examination. This has resulted in loss of
sympathetic tone to his legs and therefore
hypotension. There is no evidence that he has
any other injuries and therefore hypovolaemia
secondary to blood loss is unlikely. In patients
with spinal cord injury this blood pressure is
acceptable and intravenous ﬂuids should be
given cautiously to avoid ﬂuid overload.
Cardiogenic shock. This poor lady is having a
myocardial infarction, conﬁrmed on the ECG.
This has caused left ventricular failure and
therefore pulmonary oedema and
hypotension. Thrombolysis is contraindicated
here as she is only 4 days post surgery.
Hypovolaemia. Intraoperative haemorrhage
has resulted in hypovolaemic shock and this
man’s blood pressure has not responded to
ﬂuids. He requires an urgent blood
transfusion in order to prevent further
deterioration. Hypotension within the ﬁrst 48
hours of surgery is usually secondary to
hypovolaemia.

Anterior dislocation. 95% of shoulder
dislocations are anterior. This classically occurs
when the arm is forced into abduction and
external rotation (ball throwing position). Her
shoulder will require reduction under sedation
in casualty. She should be warned that there
is up to an 80% chance of recurrent
dislocations in her age group.
Posterior dislocation. Accounts for 2% of
shoulder dislocations and is associated with
epileptic seizures and electrocutions. It should
be suspected when the arm is held in ﬁxed
internal rotation.
Hill–Sachs lesion. Sometimes following
anterior dislocation of the shoulder the
humeral head impacts on the glenoid causing
a defect in the posterior part of the head.
The articular surface is no longer congruent
and so this defect catches on the glenoid in
certain positions. This man requires bone
grafting to restore the articular surface.
Fracture of proximal humerus. Common
fracture particularly in postmenopausal
women. Treatment depends on the degree of
displacement ranging from conservative to
operative ﬁxation or even replacement.
Rotator cuff tear. History of settling injury but
persistent weakness suggests rotator cuff tear.
Examination ﬁndings indicate weakness of
supraspinatus. Conﬁrm with ultrasound or
MRI.

Haemophilus inﬂuenzae. This used to be the
commonest cause of septic arthritis in infants
but is now rare because of a successful
vaccination programme. This unfortunate
child is not up to date, however.
E. coli. This lady has developed a septic
arthritis of her hip. This has resulted from
haematogenous spread of bacteria to the hip
from her urinary tract infection (UTI) and E.
coli is a common cause of UTIs. Always look
for a source when diagnosing septic arthritis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Travel to India
may have exposed this lady to TB which has
remained dormant for many years. This has
now become activated, however, and caused
collapse of one of her thoracic vertebral
bodies resulting in a gibbus (sharp angulated
kyphosis). She will need an MRI scan and
then biposy of the lesion to conﬁrm the
diagnosis.
Staph. aureus. This is the commonest cause
of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. This girl
seems to have developed spontaneous
osteomyelitis which will require antibiotics for
6 weeks and surgical debridement of the
bone if indicated.
Anaerobic bacteria. This man has an open
fracture which is potentially contaminated by
cattle manure amongst other things.
Anaerobic bacterial and Clostridium
perfringens (gas gangrene) infection is
important to consider here based on the
history. The fracture site should be irrigated
and debrided urgently in theatre. Heavily
soiled wounds should be covered with high
dose antibiotics including an intravenous
cephalosporin, penicillin and metronidazole.
Tetanus prophylaxis should be given if
vaccinations are not up to date.

Salter–Harris fracture. This is a fracture
around the growth plate (physis) and these
are common injuries in children.
Pathological fracture. This is a fracture
through abnormal bone. The history alone is
suspicious of this. This poor man has got lung
cancer from smoking and now has metastasis
to his right femur which has been painful.
This bone is therefore weak and low energy
activities such as walking result in fracture.
Other primary malignancies that metastasize
to bone are thyroid, kidney, breast and
prostate.
Compartment syndrome. This is unlikely to be
a fracture because he could initially walk on
his leg. Compartment syndrome can occur
with or without fractures and this man needs
urgent fasciotomies to the compartments
(within 6 hours of onset). Absent foot pulses
is a very late sign and usually indicates that
the limb needs to be amputated.
Non-accidental injury. The history is not
consistent with a healing fracture. Be very
suspicious of any fracture in children under 2
years. Take no chances, admit the child and
inform the paediatricians.
Open fracture. Any wound, no matter how
small, on the same limb as a fracture should
be assumed to be open until proven
otherwise. This lady has a puncture wound
from when the bone burst through the skin
when it was severly angulated. This lady
needs urgent debridement of the wound,
stabilization of the fracture and antibiotics to
help prevent chronic osteomyelitis.

Nerve conduction study. The distribution of
the pain is in keeping with a median nerve
lesion. The diagnosis is carpal tunnel
syndrome. This is associated with other
conditions such as diabetes mellitus and
pregnancy. Usually this is conﬁrmed with
nerve conduction studies but if the diagnosis
is very obvious the surgeon may proceed to
do a carpal tunnel decompression without
this.
MRI. This lady has sciatica, most likely from a
disc prolapse in her lumbar spine at the level
of L5/S1. X-ray may show an obvious cause
of the pain such as osteoarthritis but is often
unhelpful. MRI will provide detailed images
of the soft tissues and vertebral discs. This is
also a very useful investigation if sinister
spinal disease such as malignancy is
suspected. CT is very good at showing
detailed images of bones, e.g. for assessment
of a complex vertebral body fracture.
Venous Doppler scan. The leg may just be
swollen from surgery, but a total knee
replacement puts the patient at high risk of
deep vein thrombosis.
Ultrasound. This is likely to be a wrist
ganglion. These are usually diagnosed
clinically and excised if they cause problems,
but if the clinician is unsure, an ultrasound
scan is a simple quick non-invasive test to
provide more information. Ganglions are ﬂuid
ﬁlled and therefore can change size
depending on this. In the old days people
were encouraged to bash them with a big
book to rupture them!
Plain X-ray. This man may have metastasis to
his ulna or radial shaft and a plain X-ray
would normally show the diagnosis. Other
malignancies that commonly metastasize to
bone include thyroid, breast, lung and
prostate.

Cervical rib. Occurs in 1 in 200 people and
may be bilateral. An extra rib from C7 (may
just be a ﬁbrous band) articulates with the
ﬁrst rib or may be free distally. This may
cause vascular (subclavian artery) disturbance
such as Raynaud’s phenomenon or
neurological symptoms, normally in the
distribution of C8/T1 dermatomes. The T1
myotome supplies the small muscles of the
hand.
Pancoast’s tumour. An apical lung tumour has
resulted in compression of the sympathetic
nerves that arise from T1 and run up to
supply the eye and forehead. This results in
Horner’s syndrome (ipsilateral meiosis, ptosis
and facial anhydrosis) on the affected side.
The tumour is also compressing the T1
myotome.
Radial nerve palsy. The radial nerve runs in
the spiral groove on the posterior aspect of
the midshaft of the humerus. It is in direct
contact with the bone at this point which
makes it prone to injury.
Cervical disc prolapse C6/C7. A disc at this
level would compress the C7 nerve root
causing numbness and/or pain in the middle
ﬁnger. C7 supplies the triceps and ﬂexor carpi
radialis and there is resultant weakness of
elbow extension and ﬂexion of the wrist.
Axillary nerve palsy. This chap has sustained
an anterior dislocation of his shoulder. The
axillary nerve leaves the brachial plexus and
winds around the surgical neck of the
humerus to supply sensation to the army
badge area over the upper lateral aspect of
the upper arm, and motor function to the
deltoid. This injury is normally a neuropraxia.

Trendelenburg. This man has weakness of his
left hip abductors so when asked to stand on
his left leg, his pelvis tilts down. This results
in a Trendelenburg gait. Bilateral weakness of
the abductors results in a waddling gait when
the pelvis drops down with each step.
Foot drop. The policeman has purposefully hit
the man over his common peroneal nerve to
disable him. This nerve is very superﬁcial as it
winds around the ﬁbula neck and supplies
sensation to the dorsum of the foot and
motor supply to the dorsiﬂexors of the toes
and ankle. In order to prevent his toes
dragging on the ground he compensates by
lifting his foot high. Bilateral foot drop results
in a high stepping gait.
Ataxic. This boy has cerebral palsy secondary
to meningitis as an infant. There is a loss of
balance which is overcome by a broad based
gait.
Antalgic. Any painful condition results in an
antalgic gait. This is characterized by a
reduced stance phase (less time is spent
weight bearing on the affected side) during
walking.
Spastic. This child has cerebral palsy. Children
may display varying degrees of spasticity. Hip
adductors contract resulting in ‘scissoring’ of
the legs. The equinus deformity of his feet
will also worsen function. He may beneﬁt
from complex surgery to correct the
deformities.

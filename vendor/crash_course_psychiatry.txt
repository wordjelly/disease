Series editor foreword
The Crash Course series was first published in 1997 and now, 16 years on, we
are still going strong. Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this
series relevant for today’s students is an ongoing process. These fourth editions
build on the success of the previous titles and incorporate new and revised material,
to keep the series up-to-date with current guidelines for best practice, and recent
developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and
student reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fourth editions we have
completely re-written our self-assessment material to keep up with today’s
‘single-best answer’ and ‘extended matching question’ formats. The artwork
and layout of the titles has also been largely re-worked to make it easier on the
eye during long sessions of revision.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles on
which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all the
information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate
basic medical science and clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance
between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient depth for those aiming
at distinction. The authors are medical students and junior doctors who have recent
experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the material
is checked by a team of faculty advisors from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Just starting psychiatry? What are all these weird symptoms and wacky
questions? Why isn’t there a blood test for schizophrenia? Why is it ever
acceptable to give patients treatment they don’t want? As junior doctors who
qualified four and six years ago we well remember how difficult and confusing
psychiatry felt as medical students. Your hard-won knowledge of blood tests, ECGs
and X-rays is still required but not sufficient to do psychiatry. Instead, what you
yourself discover through observing and communicating with patients is what
matters, and for that you need to enhance your clinical skills. You have to learn
about bizarre symptoms which are hard for you to describe, let alone your patients.
You have to train your observation skills to include a patient’s mental state, not just
their physical signs. You have to learn how to comfortably ask deeply personal
questions and learn to tolerate hearing about the seemingly infinite capacity of
humans to hurt each other.
We hope this book will bring clarity to this confusion by guiding you down paths of
systematic assessments, rational diagnoses and evidence based management plans.
We’ve worked hard to always get down to the ‘clinical bottom line’, with lots of
practical tips, but we hope also to spark your interest in some of the new
neuroscientific findings in psychiatry.
If you choose a speciality with any patient contact, the communication skills
and knowledge you gain from studying psychiatry will help you be a better
doctor. We wish you the best of luck!

Faculty Advisor
If you are looking for an accessible yet comprehensive introduction to
psychiatry, this book has no rivals. The previous editions have received
well-deserved places on medical student bookshelves throughout the country,
but the current authors have substantially revised this edition to make it even
better. In particular, the self-assessment questions offer a range of carefully
constructed, realistic, clinical vignettes that focus on key diagnostic and
management decisions to help you make good decisions when you come to
work in A&E, the wards, clinics and GP surgeries. Reading this book will prepare
you well for both upcoming exams and a career in psychiatry – enjoy!

Psychiatric assessment and
diagnosis

1

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• Interview technique
• The important elements of a psychiatric history
• The mental state examination
• The importance of a physical examination in psychiatric patients
• How to present your findings
• The diagnostic classification systems used in psychiatry

The psychiatric assessment is different from a medical or
surgical assessment in that: (1) the history taking is
often longer and is aimed at understanding psychological problems that develop in patients, each with a
unique background and social environment; (2) a mental state examination is performed; and (3) the assessment can in itself be therapeutic. Figure 1.1 provides
an outline of the psychiatric assessment, which includes
a psychiatric history, mental state examination, risk
assessment, physical examination and formulation.

INTERVIEW TECHNIQUE
• Whenever possible, patients should be interviewed
in settings where privacy can be ensured – a patient
who is distressed will be more at ease in a quiet office
than in an accident and emergency cubicle.
• Chairs should be at the same level and arranged at an
angle, so that you are not sitting directly opposite the
patient.
• Establishing rapport is an immediate priority and requires the display of empathy and sensitivity by the
interviewer.
• Notes may be taken during the interview; however,
explain to patients that you will be doing so. Make
sure that you still maintain good eye contact.
• Ensure that you are seated closer to the door than the
patient to allow you an unobstructed exit should it
be required.
• Carry a personal alarm and/or know where the
alarm in the consulting room is, and check you
know how to work the alarms.
• Introduce yourself to the patient and ask them how
they would like to be addressed. Explain how long

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00001-1

the interview will last. In examination situations it
may prove helpful to explain to patients that you
may need to interrupt them due to time constraints.
• Keep track of, and ration, your time appropriately.
• Flexibility is essential, e.g. it may be helpful to put a
very anxious patient at ease by talking about their
background before focusing in on the presenting
complaint.
HINTS AND TIPS
Ensuring you have the seat closest to the door can be a
little awkward when entering a room with a patient.
One option is to reserve it in advance by placing
something on it, like a folder.

Make use of both open and closed questions when
appropriate:
Closed questions limit the scope of the response to one
or two word answers. They are used to gain specific
information, and can be used to control the length of
the interview when patients are being over-inclusive.
For example:
• Do you feel low in mood? (Yes or no answer)
• What time do you wake up in the morning? (Specific
answer)
Note that closed questions can be used at the very
beginning of the interview as they are easier to answer
and help to put patients at ease, e.g. ‘Do you live
locally?’; ‘Are you married?’ (see ‘identifying information’ below).
Open questions encourage the patient to answer freely
with a wide range of responses and should be used to

in detail below.

Identifying information
HINTS AND TIPS
Rapport building is vital when working in mental
health. Always think why a patient may have difficulty
establishing one with you (e.g. persecutory delusions,
withdrawal, apathy). Failure to establish rapport should
never be due to the interviewer.

PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY
The order in which you take the history is not as important as being systematic, making sure you cover all the

Reason for the patient’s presence in a psychiatric setting (e.g. referral to out-patient clinic by family
doctor, admitted to ward informally having presented at casualty).
• Legal status (i.e. if detained under mental health
legislation).
For example:
Mrs LM is a 32-year-old married housewife with two children aged 4 and 6 years. She was referred by her family
doctor to a psychiatric out-patient clinic.

Psychiatric history

Presenting complaint
Open questions are used to elicit the presenting complaint. Whenever possible, record the main problems
in the patient’s own words, in one or two sentences,
instead of using technical psychiatric terms, e.g.:
Mrs LM complains of ‘feeling as though I don’t know who
I am, like I’m living in an empty shell’.
Patients frequently have more than one complaint,
some of which may be related. It is helpful to organize
multiple presenting complaints into groups of symptoms that are related; for instance, ‘low mood’, ‘poor
concentration’ and ‘lack of energy’ are common features
of depression, e.g.:
Mrs LM complains firstly of ‘low mood’, ‘difficulty sleeping’ and ‘poor self-esteem’, and secondly of ‘increased
alcohol consumption’ associated with withdrawal symptoms
of ‘shaking, sweating and jitteriness’ in the morning.
It is not always easy to organize patients’ difficulties
into a simple presenting complaint in psychiatry. In this
case, give the chief complaint(s) as the presenting complaint and cover the rest of the symptoms or problems
in the history of presenting complaint.

History of presenting complaint
This section is concerned with eliciting the nature and
development of each of the presenting complaints.
The following headings may be helpful in structuring
your questioning:
•
•
•
•

Duration: when did the problems start?
Development: how did the problems develop?
Mode of onset: suddenly or over a period of time?
Course: are symptoms constant, progressively worsening or intermittent?
• Severity: how much is the patient suffering? To what
extent are symptoms affecting the patient’s social
and occupational functioning?
• Associated symptoms: certain complaints are associated
with clusters of other symptoms that should be
enquired about if patients do not mention them
spontaneously, e.g. when ‘feeling low’ is a presenting
complaint, biological, cognitive and psychotic features of depression as well as suicidal ideation should
be asked about. You can also ask about symptom
clusters for psychosis, anxiety, eating problems, substance use and cognitive problems, among others.
Also, certain symptoms are common to many psychiatric conditions and these should be screened for, e.g.
a primary complaint of insomnia may be a sign of
depression, mania, psychosis or a primary sleep
disorder.
• Precipitating factors: psychosocial stress frequently
precipitates episodes of mental illness, e.g. bereavement, moving house, relationship difficulties.

1

HINTS AND TIPS
It is useful to learn to screen patients for common
symptoms. This is especially so with patients who are
less forthcoming with their complaints. Remember
to ask about:
• Low mood (depression).
• Elevated mood and increased energy (hypomania
and mania).
• Delusions and hallucinations (psychosis).
• Free-floating anxiety, panic attacks or phobias
(anxiety disorders).
• Obsessions or compulsions (obsessive-compulsive
disorder).
• Alcohol or substance abuse.

Past psychiatric history
This is an extremely important section as it may provide
clues to the patient’s current diagnosis. It should
include:
• Previous or ongoing psychiatric diagnoses.
• Dates and duration of previous mental illness
episodes.
• Details of previous treatments, including medication, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy and
hospitalization.
• Details of previous contact with psychiatric services.
• Details of previous assessment or treatment under
mental health legislation.

Past medical history
Enquire about medical illnesses or surgical procedures.
Past head injury or surgery, neurological conditions
(e.g. epilepsy) and endocrine abnormalities (e.g. thyroid problems) are especially relevant to psychiatry.

Current medication
Note all the medication patients are using, including
psychiatric, non-psychiatric and over-the-counter drugs.
Also enquire how long patients have been on specific
medication and whether it has been effective. Nonconcordance as well as reactions and allergies should
be recorded.

Family history
• Enquire about the presence of psychiatric illness
(including suicide and substance abuse) in family
members, remembering that genetic factors are
implicated in the aetiology of many psychiatric

3

Psychiatric assessment and diagnosis
conditions. A family tree may be useful to summarize information.
• Enquire whether parents are still alive and if not,
causes of death. Also ask about significant physical
illnesses in the family.
• Ask whether the patient has any siblings and, if so,
where they are in the birth order.
• Enquire about the quality of the patient’s relationships with close family members.

Personal history
The personal history consists of a brief description of the
patient’s life. Time constraints will not allow an exhaustive biographical account, but you should attempt to include significant events, perhaps under the following
useful headings:

Infancy and early childhood (until age 5)
• Pregnancy and birth complications (e.g. prematurity, fetal distress, caesarean section).
• Developmental milestones (age of crawling, walking,
speaking, bladder and bowel control).
• Childhood illnesses.
• Unusually aggressive behaviour or impaired social
interaction.

Later childhood and adolescence (until
completion of higher education)
• History of physical, sexual or emotional abuse (if
appropriate to circumstances).
• School record (academic performance, number and
type of schools attended, age on leaving, and final
qualifications).
• Relationships with parents, teachers and peers. Victim
or perpetrator of bullying.
• Behavioural problems, including antisocial behaviour, drug use or truancy.
• Higher education and training.

• Ability to engage in satisfactory sexual relationships.
Sexual dysfunction, fetishes or gender identity problems (only enquire if problem is suspected).
COMMUNICATION
A history of sexual abuse is important to detect. This
can be awkward. Tact and discretion are vital. You may
find it useful to grade your questions, e.g.: When was
your first relationship? When was your first sexual
experience? Have you ever had an unpleasant sexual
experience? Sometimes such experiences are
unpleasant because they are unwanted or because the
person is too young to understand . . .? Leaving the
question open allows the patient room to answer freely
rather than ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

Social circumstances
This includes accommodation, social supports and relationships, employment and financial circumstances,
and hobbies or leisure activities. It is important to
identify if the patient has current frequent contact with
children, in case their presentation raises any child protection concerns. This section is important in order to
understand the social context in which the patient’s
problems developed.

Alcohol and substance use

• Details of types and duration of jobs.
• Details of and reasons for unemployment and/or
dismissal.

This section should never be overlooked, as alcohol/
substance-related psychiatric conditions are very common.
The CAGE questionnaire (see p. 122) is a useful tool
to screen for alcohol dependence. If a patient answers
affirmatively to two or more questions, regard the
screen as positive and go on to check if they meet criteria
for alcohol dependence syndrome (see p. 117). Try to
elicit a patient’s typical drinking day including daily intake of alcohol in units, type of alcohol used, time of
first drink of the day and places where drinking occurs
(e.g. at home alone or in a pub).
If illicit drugs have been or are being used, record the
drug names, routes of administration (intravenous, inhaled, oral ingestion) and the years and frequency of use.
Also enquire about possible dependence (see p. 116,
Ch. 15).

Relationship, marital and sexual history

Forensic history

• Puberty: significant early relationships and experiences as well as sexual orientation (if appropriate).
• Details and duration of significant relationships.
Reasons for break-ups.
• Marriage/divorce details. Children.

Enquire about the details and dates of previous offences
and antisocial behaviour, including prosecutions, convictions and prison sentences. It is important to ask specifically about violent crime and the age of the patient’s
first violent offence.

Occupational record

Mental state examination

Premorbid personality
The premorbid personality is an indication of the patient’s personality and character before the onset of
mental illness. It can be difficult to ascertain retrospectively. Indirect evidence of it can be provided from the
personal history (e.g. have they ever been able to hold
down a job or been in a long-term relationship? Have
their interests changed?). Patients may be asked directly
about their personality before they became ill, or it may
be useful to ask a close family member or friend about a
patient’s premorbid personality.
For example:
A young man with schizophrenia, with prominent negative symptoms of lack of motivation and interest, and poverty
of thought, was described by his mother as being outgoing,
intelligent and ambitious before becoming ill.
COMMUNICATION
One way to explore premorbid personality in a patient
with some insight is to ask questions such as:
How would people have described you before? How
about now?

1

and you should just need to ask certain key questions
to finish this process off. The individual aspects of the
MSE, which are summarized in Figure 1.1, are discussed
in more detail below.
There is some variation in the order in which the MSE
is reported (e.g. speech is sometimes described before
mood, and sometimes before thought form). As long
as you include the information, the exact order is not
important.

HINTS AND TIPS
Don’t just ask questions and write down answers!
Appearance and behaviour are vital to the mental
state examination, especially with less communicative
patients. Posture, facial expression, tone of voice,
spontaneity of speech, state of relaxation and
movements made are all important. You may find it
helpful to practise with a colleague – try writing down
10 points that describe their appearance and
behaviour without mentioning anything relating to
questions asked.

Appearance
MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION
The mental state examination (MSE) describes an interviewer’s objective impression of many aspects of a patient’s mental functioning at a certain period of time.
Whereas the psychiatric history remains relatively constant, the MSE may fluctuate from day to day or hour
to hour. It is useful to try and gather as much evidence
as possible about the MSE while doing the psychiatric
history, instead of viewing this as a separate section.
In fact, the MSE begins the moment you meet the patient. In addition to noting their appearance, you
should observe how patients first behave on meeting
you. This includes their body language and the way that
they respond to your attempts to establish rapport.
COMMUNICATION
In the mental state examination (MSE) only record
what the patient demonstrates or experiences during
the interview (for example, if a patient reports having
had a hallucination 5 minutes before you entered
the room, that would be described in the history, not
the mental state).

By the time you have finished the psychiatric history,
you should have completed many aspects of the MSE,

• Physical state: how old does the patient appear? Do
they appear physically unwell? Are they sweating?
Are they too thin or obese?
• Clothes and accessories: are clothes clean?
• Do clothes match? Are clothes appropriate to the
weather and circumstances or are they bizarre? Is
the patient carrying strange objects?
• Self-care and hygiene: does the patient appear to have
been neglecting their appearance or hygiene (e.g.
unshaven, dirty tangled hair, malodorous, dishevelled)? Is there any evidence of injury or self-harm
(e.g. cuts to wrists or forearms)?

Behaviour and psychomotor
function
This section focuses on all motor behaviour, including
abnormal movements such as tremors, tics and twitches
as well as displays of suspiciousness, aggression or fear,
and catatonic features. Documenting patients’ behaviour at the start of, and during, the interview is an integral part of the mental state examination and should be
done in as much detail as possible, e.g.:
Mrs LM introduced herself appropriately, although only
made fleeting eye contact. She sat rigidly throughout the first
half of the interview, mostly staring at the floor and speaking very softly. She became tearful halfway through the interview when talking about her lack of self-esteem. After this

5

Psychiatric assessment and diagnosis
her posture relaxed, her eye contact improved and there
were moments when she smiled. There were no abnormal
movements.
The term ‘psychomotor’ is used to describe a patient’s
motor activity as a consequence of their concurrent
mental processes. Psychomotor abnormalities include
retardation (slow, monotonous speech; slow or absent
body movements) and agitation (inability to sit still; fidgeting, pacing or hand-wringing; rubbing or scratching
skin or clothes).
Note whether you are able to establish a good rapport with patients. What is their attitude towards you?
Do they make good eye contact or do they look around
the room or at the floor? Patients may be described as
cooperative, cordial, uninterested, aggressive, defensive,
guarded, suspicious, fearful, perplexed, preoccupied,
disinhibited (that is, a lowering of normal social inhibitions, e.g. being over-familiar, or making sexually inappropriate comments), etc.

HINTS AND TIPS
Observations of appearance and behaviour may also
reveal other useful information (e.g. extrapyramidal
side-effects from antipsychotic medication). It is useful
to remember to look for:
• Parkinsonism: drug-induced signs are most
commonly a reduced arm swing and unusually
upright posture while walking. Tremor and rigidity
are late signs, in contrast to idiopathic parkinsonism.
• Acute dystonia: involuntary sustained muscular
contractions or spasms.
• Akathisia: subjective feeling of inner restlessness and
muscular discomfort.
• Tardive dyskinesia: rhythmic, involuntary
movements of head, limbs and trunk, especially
chewing, grimacing of mouth and protruding, darting
movements of tongue.

Mood and affect
Mood refers to a patient’s sustained, subjectively experienced emotional state over a period of time. Affect refers
to the transient ebb and flow of emotion in response to
particular stimuli (e.g. smiling at a joke or crying at a sad
memory).
Mood is assessed by asking patients how they are
feeling. So, a patient’s mood might be depressed, elated,
anxious, guilty, frightened, angry, etc. It is described
subjectively (what the patient says they are feeling)
and objectively (what your impression of their prevailing mood is during the interview), e.g. her mood was subjectively ‘rock bottom’ and objectively low.Figure 1.2 refers

6

to typical questions that may be used to elicit depressed,
elated or anxious moods.
Affect is assessed by observing patients’ posture, facial expression, emotional reactivity and speech. There
are two components to consider when assessing affect:
1. The appropriateness or congruity of the observed affect to the patient’s subjectively reported mood (e.g.
a woman with schizophrenia who reports feeling
suicidal with a happy facial expression would be described as having an incongruous affect).
2. The range of affect or range of emotional expressivity. In this sense affect may be:
• Within the normal range
• Blunted/flat: a noticeable reduction in the normal intensity of emotional expression as evidenced by a monotonous voice and minimal
facial expression.
Note that a labile mood refers to a fluctuating mood
state that alternates between extremes (e.g. a young
man with a mixed affective episode alternates between
feeling overjoyed with pressure of speech and miserable
with suicidal ideation).

Anxiety/obsessive-compulsive
phenomena
Obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptoms (freefloating anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, ruminatory
thoughts) need not be the presenting complaint to be
present to a clinically significant degree. These symptoms are common to many psychiatric disorders and,
if not specifically asked patients may fail to mention

Mental state examination
them. Also record stress reactions, dissociative symptoms, and depersonalization and derealization here
(see Ch. 12). Figure 1.2 can direct you to typical questions that may be used to elicit obsessive-compulsive
and anxiety symptoms.
HINTS AND TIPS
Depression and obsessive-compulsive symptoms often
coexist (>20%) with onset before, simultaneously or
after the onset of depression. You may find it useful to
have a set of screening questions ready to use.

Speech
Speech should be described in terms of:
• Rate of production: e.g. pressure of speech in mania;
long pauses and poverty of speech in depression.
• Quality and flow of speech: volume, dysarthria (articulation difficulties), dysprosody (unusual speech
rhythm, melody, intonation or pitch), stuttering.
Note that disorganized, incoherent or bizarre speech (e.g.
flight of ideas) is usually regarded as a thought disorder
and is, therefore, described under the thought section.

Thoughts
Problems with thinking are considered under two headings: thought form (abnormal patterns of thinking) and
thought content (abnormal beliefs).

Thought form
Disordered thinking includes circumstantial and tangential thinking, loosening of association (derailment/
knight’s move thinking), neologisms and idiosyncratic word use, flight of ideas, thought blocking,
perseveration, echolalia, and irrelevant answers (see
p. 70, Ch. 9, for the definitions of these terms). Whenever possible, record patients’ disorganized speech
word for word, as it can be very difficult to label disorganized thinking with a single technical term and written language may be easier to evaluate than spoken
language.

Thought content: delusions and
overvalued ideas
It is diagnostically significant to classify delusions as:
•
•
•
•

Primary or secondary.
Mood congruent or mood incongruent.
Bizarre or non-bizarre.
And according to the content of the delusion (summarized in Fig. 9.2, p. 69).

See pages 67–68, Chapter 9, for a detailed discussion.

1

Perception
Hallucinations are often mentioned during the history
However, this is not always the case, so it is important
that you specifically enquire about abnormal perceptual
experiences (perceptual abnormalities are defined and
classified on p. 66, Ch. 9). If patients admit to problems
with perception, it is important to ascertain:
• Whether the abnormal perceptions are genuine hallucinations, pseudohallucinations, illusions, or intrusive thoughts.
• From which sensory modality the hallucinations appear to arise (i.e. are they auditory, visual, olfactory,
gustatory or somatic hallucinations – see p. 67).
• Whether auditory hallucinations are elementary or
complex. If complex, are they experienced in the
first person (audible thoughts, thought echo), second person (critical, persecutory, complimentary or
command hallucinations) or third person (voices
arguing or discussing the patient, or giving a running
commentary)?
It is also important to note whether patients seem to be
responding to hallucinations during the interview, as
evidenced by them laughing inappropriately as though
they are sharing a private joke, or suddenly tilting their
head as though listening, or quizzically looking at
hallucinatory objects around the room.
Figure 1.2 can direct you to typical questions that
may be used to elicit perceptual abnormalities.

Cognition
The cognition of all patients should be screened by
checking orientation to place and time. Depending
on the circumstances, a more thorough cognitive assessment may be required. Cognitive tests are discussed
fully in Chapter 14, including tests of generalized cognitive abilities (e.g. consciousness, attention, orientation) and specific abilities (e.g. memory, language,
executive function, praxis, perception). Figures 14.1,
14.2, 14.3 and 14.12 describe methods of testing
cognition.

Insight
Insight is not an all or nothing attribute. It is often described as good, partial or poor, although really patients
lie somewhere on a spectrum and vary over time. The
key questions to answer are:
• Does the patient believe they are unwell in any way?
• Do they believe they are mentally unwell?
• Do they think they need treatment? (pharmacological, psychological or both?)
• Do they think they need to be admitted to hospital?

Psychiatric assessment and diagnosis

RISK ASSESSMENT
Although it is extremely difficult to make an accurate assessment of risk based on a single assessment, clinicians
are expected to, as far as is possible, establish some idea
of a patient’s risk to:
• Self: through self-harm, suicide, self-neglect or exploitation by others. Chapter 6 explains the assessment of suicide risk in detail.
• Others: includes violent or sexual crime, stalking and
harassment. Chapter 29, page 198, discusses key principles in assessing dangerousness.
• Children: includes physical, sexual or emotional
abuse as well as neglect or deprivation. Child abuse
is discussed in more detail in Chapter 27, page 192.
• Property: includes arson and physical destruction of
property.
HINTS AND TIPS
Risk assessment is a vital part of psychiatric assessment.
Risk to self is one part of this and you may find it helps
to also have a heading for ‘risk to others’. You should
try to get used to using both when presenting to
examiners.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The psychiatric examination includes a general physical
examination, with special focus on the neurological and
endocrine system. Always remember to look for signs
relevant to the psychiatric history, e.g. signs of liver disease in patients who abuse alcohol, opthalmoplegia or
ataxia in someone withdrawing from alcohol (indicating Wernicke’s encephalopathy), signs of self-harm in
patients with a personality disorder, signs of intravenous drug use (track marks) in patients who use drugs.
Also, examine for side-effects of psychiatric medication
(e.g. parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, dystonia and hypotension). In an exam situation it may not be possible
to complete an examination, but you should always
mention that you would do so. Always make a point
of mentioning your positive physical findings when
summarizing the case.

THE FORMULATION:
PRESENTING THE CASE
The ‘formulation’ is the term psychiatrists use to describe the integrated summary and understanding of a
particular patient’s problems. It usually includes:

8

•
•
•
•
•

Description of the patient.
Differential diagnosis.
Aetiology.
Management.
Prognosis.

Description of the patient
The patient may be described: (1) in detail by recounting all of the information obtained under the various
headings in the psychiatric history and mental state
examination; or (2) in the form of a case summary.
The case summary consists of one or two paragraphs
and contains only the salient features of a case,
specifically:
• Identifying information.
• Main features of the presenting complaint.
• Relevant background details (e.g. past psychiatric
history, positive family history).
• Positive findings in the mental state examination
and physical examination.
Figure 1.3 shows a case summary in a case formulation.
HINTS AND TIPS
When presenting your differential diagnosis,
remember that two or more psychiatric disorders can
coexist (e.g. depression and alcohol abuse). In this
event, it is important to ascertain whether the
conditions are independent or related (e.g. alcohol
abuse that has developed secondary to the
depressive symptoms of emptiness and difficulty
sleeping).

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis is mentioned in order of decreasing probability. Only mention conditions that
you have obtained evidence about in your assessment,
as you should be able to provide reasons for and against
all the alternatives on your list. Figure 1.3 provides an
example of a typical differential diagnosis.

Aetiology
The exact cause of most psychiatric disorders is very
often unknown and most cases seem to involve a
complex interplay of biological, social and psychological factors. In clinical practice, psychiatrists are especially concerned with the question: ‘What factors led
to this particular patient presenting with this specific
problem at this specific point in time?’ That is, what
factors predisposed to the problem, what factors

Prognosis
Assuming Mr PP has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is likely his illness will run a chronic course, showing a relapsing and
remitting pattern. Being a young man with a high level of education, Mr PP is particularly at risk for suicide, especially
following discharge from hospital. Good prognostic factors include a high level of premorbid functioning and the
absence of negative symptoms.

Psychiatric assessment and diagnosis
precipitated the problem and what factors are perpetuating the problem? Figure 1.3 illustrates an aetiology
grid that is very helpful in structuring your answers to
these questions in terms of biological, social and psychological factors – the emphasis should be on considering all the blocks in the grid, not necessarily on
filling them.

Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent on two factors:
1. The natural course of the condition, which is based
on studies of patient populations; these are discussed for each disorder in the relevant chapters.
2. Individual patient factors (e.g. social support, concordance with treatment, comorbid substance abuse).
See Figure 1.3 for an example.

Management
Investigations
Investigations are considered part of the management
plan and are performed based on findings from the
psychiatric assessment. It is useful to divide them into
physical, social and psychological investigations (see
p. 54, Chapter 7, for an example). Appropriate investigations relevant to specific conditions are given in the
relevant chapters. Familiarize yourself with these, as
you should be able to give reasons for any investigation
you propose.
Case summary
Mr PP is a 23-year-old, single man in full-time
education, who recently agreed to voluntary hospital
admission. He presented with a 6-month history of
hearing voices and bizarre beliefs that he was being
subjected to government experiments. During this time
his college attendance had been uncharacteristically
poor, he had terminated his part-time work, and he had
become increasingly socially withdrawn. He has no
history of past psychiatric illness and denies the use of
alcohol or illicit substances; however he did mention
that his maternal uncle suffers from schizophrenia. On
mental state examination he appeared unkempt and
behaved suspiciously. He had delusions of persecution,
reference and thought control as well as delusional
perception. He also described second person command
hallucinations and third person, running commentary
hallucinations. He appeared to have no insight into his
mental illness as he refused to consider that he might be
unwell. There were no abnormalities on physical
examination.

Specific management plan
It may help to structure your management plan by
considering biological, social and psychological aspects of treatment (the biopsychosocial approach) in
terms of immediate to short-term, and medium to
long-term management. See Figure 1.3 for an example
of this method.

10

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that investigations do not just include
physical investigations (e.g. blood tests), but also
include social investigations (e.g. obtaining collateral
information from the patient’s GP or family, obtaining
social work reports); and psychological investigations
(e.g. psychometric testing, mood rating scales).

CLASSIFICATION IN PSYCHIATRY
There are two main categorical classification systems in
psychiatry:
1. ICD-10: the tenth revision of the International
Classification of Diseases, Chapter V (F) – Mental
and behavioural disorders (published by the
World Health Organization). The eleventh revision, ICD-11, is under preparation at the time of
writing.
2. DSM-IV: the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (published
by the American Psychiatric Association). The text
of the next edition, DSM-V, is under preparation
at the time of writing.
Both the ICD-10 and DSM-IV make use of a categorical
classification system, which refers to the process of dividing mental disorders into discrete entities by means of
accurate descriptions of specific categories. In contrast,
a dimensional approach rejects the idea of separate categories, hypothesizing that mental conditions exist on a
continuum that merges into normality.
The ICD-10 categorizes mental disorders according
to descriptive statements and diagnostic guidelines.
The DSM-IV categorizes mental disorders according to
operational definitions, which means that mental disorders are defined by a series of precise inclusion and exclusion criteria. Note that the research version of the
ICD-10 (Diagnostic criteria for research) also makes
use of operational definitions.
In general, both the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV propose
a hierarchical diagnostic system, whereby disorders
higher on the hierarchical ladder tend to be given precedence. As a broad rule, organic and substance-related

1

Classification in psychiatry
conditions take precedence over conditions such as
schizophrenia and mood disorders, which take precedence over anxiety disorders. This does not mean that
patients may not have more than one diagnosis; they
may. It means that clinicians should:

presents with features of depression and anxiety, and
depression commonly presents with features of anxiety; in both cases, the treatment of the primary condition results in resolution of the symptoms – a
separate diagnosis for every symptom is not needed.

• Always consider a medical, or substance-related,
cause of psychological symptoms, before any other.
• Remember that certain conditions have symptoms
in common. For example, schizophrenia commonly

The ICD-10 and the DSM-IV share similar diagnostic
categories and are, for the most part, technically compatible. Figure 1.4 summarizes the main diagnostic categories in the ICD-10.

Psychiatric assessment and diagnosis
The DSM-IV uses a multi-axial diagnostic system with
five axes. Axes I and II comprise the entire spectrum of
mental disorders. Axis I includes all mental disorders except personality disorders and mental retardation, which
fall under Axis II. Axis III includes any concurrent physical
disorder or medical condition, whether causative of the
mental condition or not. Axis IV includes any social or environmental problems that contribute to the mental condition. Axis V consists of a score from 0 to 100, obtained
from a global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale.
COMMUNICATION
The term ‘neurosis’ is no longer used in the DSM-IV,
although retained in the ICD-10 as the group heading
title for the anxiety disorders: F4 – Neurotic, stress

12

related and somatoform disorders. When first
introduced, ‘neurosis’ was the label given to all
‘diseases of the nerves’. However, in modern times, it
generally refers to mental disorders:
• That do not have an identified organic or substancerelated aetiology
• In which contact with reality is maintained (that is,
non-psychotic disorders)
• That are characterized by symptoms within the range
of normal experience (e.g. anxiety).
It is best to avoid using this vague term. Instead, use the
specific term that accurately describes the condition
(e.g. generalized anxiety disorder or obsessivecompulsive disorder).

Anxiolytics and hypnotics
Other

Despite its simplicity, this arbitrary method of grouping
drugs is flawed because many drugs from one class are
now used to treat disorders in another class, e.g. antidepressants are first line therapies for many anxiety disorders
and some antipsychotics also have mood stabilizing and
antidepressant effects.

antidepressants work. Although there are at least eight
different classes of antidepressants, their common action is to elevate the levels of one or more monoamine
neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Figure 2.1 illustrates the mechanism of action of antidepressants at
synapses. The latest research has focused on monoamine neurotransmitter activation of ‘second messenger’ signal transduction mechanisms. This results in
the production of transcription factors that lead to the
activation of genes controlling the expression of downstream targets such as ‘brain-derived neurotrophic factor’ (BDNF). BDNF is neuroprotective and might be
one key target of antidepressant action. Figure 2.2 summarizes the classification and pharmacodynamics of the
important antidepressants.

ANTIDEPRESSANTS

History

HINTS AND TIPS

Antidepressants were first used in the late 1950s, with
the appearance of the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)
imipramine and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor
(MAOI) phenelzine. Research into TCAs throughout
the 1960s and 1970s developed many more tricyclic
agents and related compounds. A major development
in the late 1980s was the arrival of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (Prozac®).
There has since been considerable expansion of the SSRI
class, and development of antidepressants with other
mechanisms such as mirtazapine.

Classification and mechanism
of action
At present we classify antidepressants according to their
pharmacological actions, as we do not as yet have an
adequate explanation as to what exactly makes

Certain tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. clomipramine)
have more potency for blocking the serotonin reuptake
pump; whereas others are more selective for
noradrenaline (norepinephrine) (e.g. desipramine,
nortriptyline). Most, however, block both
noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and serotonin
reuptake.

• Depression – see pages 135–136.
• Anxiety disorders – see pages 149–150.
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (clomipramine) –
see pages 149–150.

• Other: eating disorders, chronic pain, Parkinson’s
disease, migraine prophylaxis, tuberculosis.

Side-effects and contraindications
SSRIs
SSRIs have fewer anticholinergic effects than the
TCAs, and are not sedating. The majority of patients
find them alerting, so they are prescribed in the
morning. Soon after initiation, or when taken at high
doses, some patients can feel alerted to the point of
agitation/anxiety. This may be associated with an increased risk of suicide, particularly in adolescents.
The only SSRI recommended in under 18s is fluoxetine. Due to their low cardiotoxicity, SSRIs are the antidepressant of choice in patients with cardiac disease
and in those who are at risk of taking an overdose.
However, they do have their own side-effects that
may be unacceptable to some patients. These are
summarized in Figure 2.3. Venlafaxine is a selective

serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor,
which has similar side-effects to SSRIs but they tend
to be more severe.
Contraindications: mania.

Mirtazapine
Mirtazapine is very commonly associated with increased appetite, weight gain, and sedation (via histamine antagonism). These side-effects can be used to
advantage in many patients. It is also associated with
headache and a dry mouth, and less commonly dizziness, postural hypotension, tremor and peripheral oedema. It has negligible anticholinergic effects.
Contraindications: mania.

Tricyclic antidepressants
Figure 2.4 summarizes the common side-effects of the
TCAs, most of which are related to the multi-receptor
blocking effects of these drugs. The side-effect of sedation can be useful if patients have insomnia. TCAs with
prominent sedative effects include amitriptyline and
clomipramine. Those with less sedative effects include
lofepramine and imipramine. Due to their cardiotoxic
effects, TCAs are dangerous in overdose, although lofepramine (a newer TCA) has fewer antimuscarinic effects
and so is relatively safer.
Contraindications: recent myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, severe liver disease, mania and high risk of
overdose.
Trazodone is molecularly similar to tricyclics but
clinically quite different. It is a relatively weak antidepressant but a good sedative. It is relatively safe in overdose and has negligible anticholinergic side-effects. It is
often used as an adjunctive antidepressant in those

16

receiving a non-sedative primary antidepressant, e.g.
an SSRI.
HINTS AND TIPS
Antidepressants should be used with caution in patients
with epilepsy, as they tend to lower the seizure threshold.

MAOIs/RIMA
Due to the risk of serious interactions with certain foods
and other drugs, the MAOIs have become second line
antidepressants. Their inhibition of monoamine oxidase A results in the accumulation of amine neurotransmitters and impairs the metabolism of some amines
found in certain drugs (e.g. decongestants) and foodstuffs (e.g. tyramine). Because MAOIs bind irreversibly
to monoamine oxidase A and B, amines may accumulate to dangerously high levels, which may precipitate
a life-threatening hypertensive crisis. An example of this
occurs when the ingestion of dietary tyramine results in
a massive release of noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
from endogenous stores. This is termed the ‘cheese reaction’ because some mature cheeses typically contain
high levels of tyramine. Note that an early warning sign
is a throbbing headache. Figure 2.5 lists the drugs and
foodstuffs that should be avoided in patients taking
MAOIs.
The RIMA moclobemide reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A. Therefore, the drug will be displaced
from the enzyme as amine levels start to increase. So, although there is a small risk of developing a hypertensive
crisis if high levels of tyramine are ingested, dietary restrictions are much less onerous.
When other antidepressants that have a strong serotonergic effect (e.g. SSRIs, clomipramine, imipramine)

HINTS AND TIPS
The abrupt withdrawal of any antidepressant may
result in a discontinuation syndrome with symptoms
such as gastrointestinal disturbance, agitation,
dizziness, headache, tremor and insomnia. SSRIs with
short half-lives (e.g. paroxetine, sertraline) and
venlafaxine are particular culprits. Therefore, all
antidepressants (with the exception of fluoxetine,
which has a long half-life and many active metabolites)
should be gradually tapered down before being
withdrawn completely. Although certain
antidepressants may cause a withdrawal syndrome,
they do not cause a dependence syndrome or
‘addiction’ in that patients do not become tolerant to
them or crave them.

Cocaine
Ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine

are administered simultaneously with an MAOI, the
risk of developing the potentially lethal ‘serotonin
syndrome’ is increased. In common with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, it is associated with the triad
of neuromuscular abnormalities, altered consciousness
level and autonomic instability but the two are usually
easily distinguished on the basis of the history (see
Fig. 2.11). Therefore, other antidepressants should
not be started for 2 weeks after an MAOI has been
stopped (3 weeks in the case of clomipramine and
imipramine). Conversely, an MAOI should not be
started for 2 weeks after the termination of another antidepressant (3 weeks in the case of clomipramine and
imipramine; 5 weeks in the case of fluoxetine, because
of its long half-life). The coadministration of opiates
and an MAOI can also result in the serotonin syndrome. This is because opiates (especially pethidine
and tramadol) have some intrinsic serotonin reuptake
inhibitory activity.
MAOIs may have further side-effects similar to the
TCAs, including postural hypotension and anticholinergic effects.
Contraindications (MAOIs): phaeochromocytoma,
cerebrovascular disease, hepatic impairment, mania.

MOOD STABILIZERS
These include lithium and the anticonvulsants valproate,
carbamazepine and lamotrigine. Other anticonvulsants,
such as gabapentin, topiramate and vigabatrin, are also
being investigated for mood stabilizing properties.

History
In 1949, John Cade discovered that lithium salts caused
lethargy when injected into animals, and later reported
lithium’s antimanic properties in humans. Trials in the
1950s and 1960s led to the drug entering mainstream
practice in 1970.
Valproate was first recognized as an effective anticonvulsant in 1962. Along with carbamazepine and lamotrigine, it was later shown to be effective in bipolar
affective disorder.

Mechanism of action
It is not known how any of the mood stabilizers work.
Lithium appears to modulate the neurotransmitterinduced activation of second messenger systems. Valproate and carbamazepine may exert their effect via the GABA
system; carbamazepine is a GABA agonist and valproate
inhibits GABA transaminase. Lamotrigine reduces neural
activation via inhibition of sodium channels.

Indications
Lithium is used in the treatment of:
• Acute mania – see page 137.
• Prophylaxis of bipolar affective disorder (prevention
of relapse) – see page 138.

17

Pharmacological therapy and electroconvulsive therapy
• Treatment-resistant depression (lithium augmentation) – see page 136.
• Other: adjunct to antipsychotics in schizoaffective
disorder and schizophrenia; and aggression/
impulsivity – see page 144 and page 161.

It follows that the following investigations are
needed prior to initiating therapy:
HINTS AND TIPS
Valproate is available in formulations as sodium
valproate, valproic acid and semisodium valproate
(Depakote®), which comprises equimolar amounts of
sodium valproate and valproic acid. Different
formulations have different equivalent doses, so
prescribe by brand.

Side-effects and contraindications
Lithium
Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window between
non-therapeutic and toxic blood levels. Lower levels
can be toxic in older patients.
• Therapeutic levels: 0.5–1.0 mmol/L.
• Toxic levels: >1.5 mmol/L.
• Dangerously toxic levels: >2 mmol/L.
Lithium is only taken orally and is excreted almost entirely by the kidneys. Clearance of lithium is decreased
with renal impairment (e.g. in older adults, dehydration) and sodium depletion. Certain drugs such as
diuretics (especially thiazides), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and ACE-inhibitors
can also increase lithium levels and should ideally be
avoided or prescribed with utmost caution. Furthermore, antipsychotics may synergistically increase
lithium-induced neurotoxicity; this is important as lithium and antipsychotics are often coadministered in
acute mania. Figure 2.6 summarizes the side-effects
and signs of toxicity of lithium.

ANTIPSYCHOTICS

History and classification
Antipsychotics or neuroleptics (originally known as
‘major tranquillizers’) appeared in the early 1950s with
the introduction of the phenothiazine chlorpromazine.
A number of antipsychotics with a similar pharmacodynamic action soon followed, e.g. the butyrophenone
haloperidol in the 1960s. Their ability to treat psychotic
symptoms had a profound impact on psychiatry, accelerating the movement of patients out of asylums and
into the community. However, serious motor sideeffects (extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSE)), soon became apparent with all these drugs.
Clozapine was the first antipsychotic with fewer EPSE,
and thus was termed ‘atypical’. It led to the introduction
of several other atypical (or ‘second generation’) antipsychotics, including risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine. The older antipsychotics such as haloperidol and
chlorpromazine became known as the conventional,
‘first generation’, or ‘typical’ antipsychotics. However,
this distinction is increasingly viewed as artificial – all antipsychotics can induce extrapyramidal motor side-effects
if given at high enough doses. Clozapine is the only ‘true’
atypical antipsychotic in that it has a distinct receptor
binding profile and can be effective in two-thirds of
the patients for whom other antipsychotics have failed.
Figure 2.8 lists common antipsychotics.

*Can be given in long-acting intramuscular injection (depot) form.

Mechanism of action and
side-effects
The primary mechanism of action of all antipsychotics,
with the possible exception of clozapine, is antagonism
of dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine
pathway. Clozapine is a comparatively weak D2 antagonist but has a high affinity for serotonin type 2 receptors (5-HT2) and D4 receptors, among many other
receptor targets. Most second generation antipsychotics
also block 5-HT2 receptors.
Unfortunately, blockade of dopamine D2 receptors
occurs throughout the brain, resulting in diverse sideeffects. In addition, antipsychotics also cause side-effects
by blocking muscarinic, histaminergic and a-adrenergic
receptors (as do TCAs). Figure 2.9 summarizes both the
useful and troublesome clinical effects of D2-receptor
antagonism as well as the side-effects caused by the
blockage of other receptors. Learn this table well; these
effects are often asked for in exams.
The risk of metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes,
hypertension and dyslipidaemia) is particularly high
with clozapine and other second generation antipsychotics. Metabolic syndrome is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality so it is important to
monitor and manage the components of this syndrome.

Clozapine is associated with some rare serious
side-effects such as agranulocytosis, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy which mean it is reserved for treatmentresistant cases.
Contraindications/cautions: severely reduced consciousness level (sedating), phaeochromocytoma,
Parkinson’s disease (can exacerbate), epilepsy (seizure
threshold lowered), cardiac disease (can induce
arrhythmias – consider baseline ECG) and metabolic
syndrome). Clozapine should not be re-prescribed to
someone with a history of agranulocytosis.
HINTS AND TIPS
If you can remember the side-effects of tricyclic
antidepressants you can remember many of
the side-effects of antipsychotics as both are

20

multi-receptor blockers. Both groups are anticholinergic
(dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, urinary
retention), anti-adrenergic (postural hypotension) and
anti-histaminergic (sedation, weight gain).

HINTS AND TIPS
The extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSE) of parkinsonian
motor symptoms and acute dystonia are due to a
relative deficiency of dopamine and an excess of
acetylcholine induced by dopamine antagonism in the
nigrostriatal pathway. This is why anticholinergic drugs
are effective treatments.

Antipsychotics
Figure 2.10 summarizes the antipsychotic-induced
extrapyramidal side-effects and treatment. See also
Figure 2.11.
Certain antipsychotics are available in a slow-release
form, as an intramuscular depot preparation that can be
administered every 1–4 weeks, e.g. flupentixol
(Depixol®), zuclopenthixol (Clopixol®). They are used
for patients who are poorly concordant with oral
therapy.
HINTS AND TIPS
Clozapine is a very effective antipsychotic but, due to
the life-threatening risk of bone marrow suppression
with agranulocytosis (0.8% of patients), is only used in
treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Patients should be
registered with a clozapine monitoring service and have
a full blood count (FBC) prior to starting treatment. This
is followed by weekly FBCs for several weeks, followed
by monthly FBCs for the duration of treatment. With
monitoring, fatalities from agranulocytosis are very rare
(less than 1 in 5000 patients on clozapine).

ANXIOLYTIC AND HYPNOTIC
DRUGS
A hypnotic drug is one that induces sleep. An anxiolytic
or sedative drug is one that reduces anxiety. This differentiation is not particularly helpful as anxiolytic drugs
can induce sleep when given in higher doses and hypnotics can have a calming effect when given in lower
doses, e.g. the benzodiazepines, which are anxiolytic
in low doses and hypnotic in high doses. All of these
drugs can result in tolerance, dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, their effects, when
used in combination or with alcohol, are additive.
The most important drugs in this group are the benzodiazepines and ‘Z drugs” (zopiclone, zolpidem and
zaleplon), which have very similar actions and
indications.
HINTS AND TIPS
In the past, the antipsychotics have been referred to as
the ‘major tranquillizers’ and the anxiolytics as the
‘minor tranquillizers’. This is misleading because:
(1) these drugs are not pharmacologically related; (2) the
antipsychotics do far more than just tranquillize; and
(3) the effect and use of anxiolytics is in no way minor.

22

History
In the 1960s the benzodiazepines replaced the often
abused barbiturates as the drugs of choice for the treatment
of anxiety and insomnia. However, this initial enthusiasm
was tempered by the observations that they were associated
with serious dependence and withdrawal syndromes, and
had gained a market as drugs of abuse. Z drugs were introduced in the 1990s and initially thought to be less likely to
cause dependence – this is not true. Today, benzodiazepines and Z drugs are recognized as highly effective and relatively safe drugs when prescribed judiciously, for short
periods, and with good patient education.

Classification
From a clinical perspective, it is important to classify benzodiazepines and Z drugs according to their strength,
their length of action and their routes of administration.
Figure 2.12 summarizes these qualities in some common
drugs.

Mechanism of action
Benzodiazepines potentiate the action of GABA
(g-aminobutyric acid), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. They bind to specific benzodiazepine receptors on the GABAA receptor complex, which
results in an increased affinity of the complex for GABA,

and so an increased flow of chloride ions into the cell.
This hyperpolarizes the post-synaptic membrane and
reduces neuronal excitability. Z drugs act at a different
site on the benzodiazepine receptor in the GABAA receptor complex, also potentiating chloride entry.

Indications of benzodiazepines
• Insomnia, especially short-acting benzodiazepines
(short-term use) – see page 203.
• Anxiety disorders – see page 150.
• Alcohol withdrawal, especially chlordiazepoxide –
see page 154.
• Akathisia – see Figure 2.10.
• Acute mania or psychosis (sedation) – see page 137,
143 and page 145.
• Other: epilepsy prophylaxis, seizures, muscle spasm
(diazepam), anaesthetic premedication.

Indications of Z drugs
• Insomnia (short-term use) – see page 203.

Side-effects of benzodiazepines
and Z drugs
• Risk of developing dependence, especially with prolonged use and shorter acting drugs.
• Patients should be warned about the potential dangers of driving or operating machinery due to drowsiness, ataxia and reduced motor coordination.
• Use with great caution in older adults where drowsiness, confusion and ataxia can precipitate falls or
delirium.

• Use with caution in patients with chronic respiratory
disease (e.g. COPD, sleep apnoea) as they may depress respiration.
HINTS AND TIPS
Benzodiazepines or Z drugs (zopiclone, zolpidem and
zaleplon), are seldom fatal in overdose if taken alone,
but can be when taken in combination with other
sedatives. Flumazenil is an antagonist at the
benzodiazepine receptor, and can reverse the effects of
both benzodiazepines and Z drugs.

HINTS AND TIPS
Alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants,
antihistamines and other sedatives may all enhance the
effects of benzodiazepines and Z drugs; therefore,
moderate doses of benzodiazepines in combination
with some of these substances can result in respiratory
depression.

Other hypnotic and anxiolytic
agents
• Buspirone is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist that is used to
treat generalized anxiety disorder. It is unrelated to
the benzodiazepines, does not have hypnotic, anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties, and is
not associated with dependence or abuse. Response

23

Pharmacological therapy and electroconvulsive therapy
to treatment may take up to 2 weeks, unlike the benzodiazepines which have an immediate anxiolytic
effect.
• Sedating antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine
(Nytol®)) are available for insomnia without a prescription. Unfortunately, their long duration of action may lead to drowsiness the following day.

OTHER DRUGS USED IN

treatment for certain types of schizophrenia, specifically
catatonic states, positive psychotic symptoms and schizoaffective disorder. ECT is also used for puerperal psychosis (see Ch. 24) with prominent mood symptoms or
severe postnatal depression where a rapid improvement
is necessary to reunite the mother with her baby.

Administration and mechanism
of action
ECT is administered 2–3 times per week. Most patients
need between 4 and 12 treatments. An anaesthetist administers a short-acting induction agent and muscle
relaxant that ensure about 5 minutes of general anaesthesia. During this time, a psychiatrist applies two electrodes to the patient’s scalp, in a bilateral or unilateral
placement, and delivers an electric current of sufficient
charge to effect a generalized seizure of at least 15 seconds
in duration.
It is still not clear how ECT works. It causes a release
of neurotransmitters as well as hypothalamic and pituitary hormones; it also affects neurotransmitter receptors and second messenger systems, and results in a
transient increase in blood–brain barrier permeability.

ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY

History
The possibility that seizures could improve psychiatric
symptoms arose from the observation that convulsions
appeared to lead to an improvement of psychotic symptoms in patients with comorbid epilepsy and schizophrenia. This led to seizures being induced pharmacologically
with intramuscular camphor in the early 1930s. An electric stimulus was later discovered to be an effective way of
inducing seizures, although it proved to be a crude and
often dangerous procedure without modern-day anaesthetic induction agents and muscle relaxants. Today,
ECT is a safe and often life-saving treatment for patients
with serious mental illness. It is the most effective treatment known for severe depression.

Indications
ECT is predominantly used for depression, and can be
particularly effective in older adults. Although antidepressants are usually tried first, ECT is considered for
the following features of depression:
•
•
•
•

Life-threatening poor fluid intake.
Strong suicidal intent.
Psychotic features or stupor.
Antidepressants are ineffective or not tolerated.

Although ECT may precipitate a manic episode in patients with bipolar affective disorder, it is an effective
treatment for established mania. ECT is also an effective

24

Side-effects
The mortality rate associated with ECT is the same as
that for any minor surgical procedure under general anaesthesia (i.e. around 1 in 100 000). Loss of memory is a
common complaint, particularly for events surrounding
the ECT. Some patients also report some impairment of
autobiographical memory. Unfortunately, studies that
examine the long-term effects of ECT are difficult to perform. Memory impairment can be reduced by unilateral
electrode placement (as opposed to bilateral).
Minor complaints such as confusion, headache, nausea and muscle pains are experienced by 80% of patients.
Anaesthetic complications (e.g. arrhythmias, aspiration)
can be reduced by good preoperative assessment. Prolonged seizures may occur, especially in patients who
are on drugs that lower the seizure threshold (e.g. antidepressants and antipsychotics). In contrast, benzodiazepines increase the seizure threshold, making it more
difficult to induce a seizure of adequate length.

Contraindications
There are no absolute contraindications to ECT. Relative
contraindications include:
• Heart disease (recent myocardial infarction, heart
failure, ischaemic heart disease).
• Raised intracranial pressure.
• Risk of cerebral bleeding (hypertension, recent stroke).
• Poor anaesthetic risk.

Psychological therapy

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• What is meant by ‘psychological therapy’
• Which professionals deliver it
• The different approaches that may be used
• What approaches can be useful in different circumstances

Psychological therapy describes the interaction between
a therapist and a client that aims to impart beneficial
changes in the client’s thoughts, feelings and behaviours.
Psychological therapy, which is often known as ‘psychotherapy’ or ‘talking therapy’, may be useful in alleviating
specific symptoms (e.g. social phobia), or in helping a
client improve their overall sense of well-being.
Members of different professional disciplines, including clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, occupational
therapists, mental health nurses, art and drama therapists
and counsellors, may all practise psychotherapy, provided they have had adequate training and supervision.

PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC
APPROACHES
There are many different approaches to psychotherapy.
Research has shown efficacy for many different types of
psychotherapies for many conditions. This has led to
the idea that the success of psychotherapy might be
due to certain common therapeutic factors as opposed
to specific theories or techniques. A comprehensive review of psychotherapy research showed that common
factors (occurring in any model of therapy) account for
85% of the therapeutic effect, whereas theoretical orientation only accounts for 15%. Therefore, the use of a
modality with which the patient can identify and work
may be more important than the theoretical basis of
the therapy itself. Common therapeutic factors include
client factors (personal strengths, social supports), therapist–client relationship factors (empathy, acceptance,
warmth), and the client’s expectancy of change.
HINTS AND TIPS
‘Self-help’ is the umbrella term used to describe the
process of self-guided improvement. Often, self-help

© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00003-5

resources utilize psychological techniques (especially
cognitive-behavioural therapy) and educational
materials. Self-help may involve books, DVDs,
interactive websites and discussion groups (including
Internet-based forums). Self-help materials may be
provided from, and progress followed and reviewed by,
healthcare professionals (known as ‘facilitated’ or
‘guided’ self-help), and can be incredibly useful for
some people, either in the management of less severe
psychological ailments or as an adjunct to other forms
of treatment. Group-based peer support is a form of
self-help delivered to groups of patients with shared
symptoms, during which experiences can be shared
and progress reviewed by a facilitator.

HINTS AND TIPS
The single factor most commonly associated with a good
therapeutic outcome is the strength of the client–
therapist relationship (therapeutic alliance), regardless of
the modality of therapy. In some cases, it may be
beneficial to use a mixture of modalities (e.g.
psychodynamic, interpersonal, and cognitivebehavioural therapy) uniquely tailored to understanding
and treating the patient (known as ‘eclectic therapy’).

Counselling and supportive
psychotherapy
Psychotherapy is sometimes distinguished from counselling, although they exist on a continuum; from counselling and supportive psychotherapy (least complex),

25

Psychological therapy
to psychodynamic psychotherapy and sophisticated cognitive therapy (more complex and requiring more specialist training).
Counselling is usually brief in duration and is recommended for patients with minor mental health or interpersonal difficulties, or for those experiencing stressful
life circumstances (e.g. grief counselling for bereavement). Counselling helps patients utilize their own
strengths, with the therapist being reflective and empathic. The provision of relevant information and
advice is also considered to be counselling, which is
undertaken by healthcare professionals of all specialties.
In person-centred counselling, the therapist assumes
an empathic and reflective role, allowing patients to discover their own insights using the basic principle that
the client ultimately knows best. Problem solving
counselling is more directive and focused as patients
are actively assisted in finding solutions to their problems. These types of counselling may provide some benefit for patients with mild anxiety and depression;
however, they tend not to be as useful for more severe
mental disorders.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy
Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy have changed substantially since Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalytic theory in the late 19th century. Figure 3.1
summarizes some of his ideas regarding personality.
The contributions of many other influential theorists
(e.g. Melanie Klein, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, John Bowlby,
Donald Winnicott), alongside the introduction of evidence-based practice, has meant the continued evolution
of theory and technique. However, the basic assumptions
of psychoanalytic theory remain consistent: namely that
it is mainly unconscious thoughts, feelings and fantasies
that give rise to distressing symptoms, and that these processes are kept unconscious by defence mechanisms (which
are employed when anxiety-producing aspects of the self
threaten to break through to the conscious mind, potentially giving rise to intolerable feelings (Fig. 3.2)).
The essential aim of psychoanalysis or psychodynamic psychotherapy is to facilitate conscious recognition of symptom-causing unconscious processes. It is
the therapist’s role to identify and interpret these

processes (of which patients are unaware), and to facilitate their understanding of unconscious processes in the
context of a safe, caring relationship. Historically, various
methods have been used (free association; hypnosis; interpretation of dreams and fantasy material; analysis of
defence mechanisms – see Fig. 3.2). However, modern
psychodynamic psychotherapy mainly relies on the analysis of transference and counter-transference:
• Transference is the theoretical process by which the
patient (inappropriately and unconsciously) transfers
feelings or attitudes experienced in an earlier significant relationship onto the therapist (e.g. a male
patient becomes angry with his therapist whom he
sees as cold and uncaring, unconsciously reminding
him of his mother).
• Counter-transference refers to the feelings that are
evoked in the therapist during the course of therapy.
The therapist pays attention to noticing these feelings, as these may be representative of what the
patient is feeling, and so help the therapist to

empathize with the patient. Often therapists have
undergone therapy themselves as part of their
training – this helps them to separate out what feelings belong to them, and what feelings to the patient.
Although the terms psychoanalytic and psychodynamic
are often used interchangeably, they differ in the following ways:
• Psychoanalysis describes the therapy where clients see
their analyst several times per week for a non-specified
period of time. Psychoanalysis is conducted with clients lying on a couch with the analyst sitting behind
them out of view. The analyst may be quieter than
in psychodynamic therapy, and there is space for the
patient to explore what comes into their mind, and
for the analyst to help the client understand how they
relate to the therapist (the transference) and to others.
• Psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on psychoanalytical theory; however, it tends to be more interactive, occurs once weekly for 50 minutes per
session, during which time the patient and therapist

27

Psychological therapy
sit face to face. Duration of therapy varies depending
on the patient’s individual needs, but it can range
from 4 months to several years. Psychodynamic psychotherapy may be conducted on an individual basis or in a group setting (p. 29).
Due to the time- and resource-intensive nature (for both
the health service and the patient) of classical psychoanalysis, this is very seldom offered within the NHS,
with weekly psychodynamic therapy being favoured.
However, psychoanalysis is still practised within the
private sector.
Mentalization-based therapy is one example of a therapy derived from psychodynamic psychotherapy, and is
summarized in Figure 3.6 (p. 31).
COMMUNICATION
Transference and counter-transference are
unconscious processes that often occur in settings
outside psychodynamic psychotherapy. Patients may
inappropriately react to healthcare professionals as if
they were some significant figure from the past. An
example is when patients express unwarranted anger
towards doctors or nurses when they do not receive
immediate attention: this may be considered anger that
was initially experienced towards neglectful parents.
Similarly, health workers may misplace feelings from
their own earlier relationships onto patients.

Behaviour therapy
Behaviour therapy is concerned with changing maladaptive behaviour patterns that have arisen through
learning (classical or operant conditioning). The premise is that if a patient changes his behaviour to make
it more adaptive, this will have positive effects on how
they think about things. Figure 3.3 summarizes some of
the techniques used in behaviour therapy.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy
Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is based on the assumption that the way in which individuals think about
things (i.e. their cognitions) subsequently determines
how they feel and behave. Likewise, physical or psychological feelings can influence the way in which an individual thinks and behaves.
Automatic thoughts involuntarily enter an individual’s
mind in response to specific situations (e.g. ‘He doesn’t
like me’; ‘I’m such an idiot’; ‘I’m so boring’). Dysfunctional assumptions are the faulty ‘rules’ that individuals
live by that underlie what automatic thoughts occur.
When broken (as they inevitably are), the result is normally psychological distress (e.g. ‘If I don’t come first,
then I am completely useless’; ‘If I hurt someone, then
I am evil’). The rules themselves may be inherently
problematic (e.g. ‘If I tell people how I feel this means
I’m weak’). The patient is often encouraged to keep a diary of automatic thoughts, and from this the patients

Graded exposure: a hierarchy of increasingly threatening situations
is created (e.g. spider in another room ! spider in the same
room ! spider near the patient ! spider on the patient’s hand).
Patient exposed to (or imagines) the least threatening situation and
stays in the situation until their anxiety reduces towards normal
levels. When anxiety relief has been achieved, patients are then
exposed to increasingly threatening situations.
Flooding: patient instantly exposed to the highest level of their
anxiety hierarchy until their anxiety diminishes, (e.g. throwing
patient with a fear of water in the deep end of a swimming pool)
(flooding by imagination is termed implosion therapy)

thinking styles (technically called ‘cognitive distortions’) can be identified. Some examples are given in
Figure 3.4.
The process of therapy draws on the principle that
automatic thoughts and dysfunctional assumptions
may be challenged (and changed) by behavioural experiments (testing dysfunctional thoughts against reality).
Using an example, Figure 3.5 illustrates the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviours; how
automatic thoughts and dysfunctional assumptions
may affect this relationship; and how challenging these
may result in change.
CBT differs from psychodynamic psychotherapy in
that: it is time-limited (12–24 sessions); it is goaloriented and predominantly focuses on present problems (less concerned with the details of how problems
developed or unconscious factors); the therapeutic relationship is strongly collaborative (deciding together on
the session’s agenda and case formulation); it involves
patients doing ‘homework assignments’. Also, due to
its structured format, CBT is more amenable to efficacy
studies.
Some other forms of therapy that incorporate elements of CBT are summarized in Figure 3.6.

Interpersonal therapy
Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is based on the assumption
that problems with interpersonal relationships and social
functioning are significant contributors to the development of mental illness, as well as being a consequence
of mental illness (particularly depression). IPT attempts
to enable patients to evaluate their social interactions
and improve their interpersonal skills in all social roles,

from close family and friendships to community and
work-related roles. One of the following areas is chosen
as the main focus: (1) role disputes; (2) role transitions;
(3) interpersonal deficits; and (4) loss or grief. IPT tends
to focus on current problems and is brief in duration
(12–16 sessions).

Group therapy
Group therapy may be practised according to different
theoretical orientations, from supportive to cognitivebehavioural to psychodynamic approaches. Most groups
meet once weekly for an hour and consist of one or two
therapists and about 5–10 patients. Therapy can run
from months (CBT orientation) to years (psychodynamic orientation). Group therapy allows patients
(and therapists) the opportunity to observe and analyse
their psychological and behavioural responses to other
members of the group in a ‘safe’ social setting. It is
thought that group therapy owes its effectiveness to a
number of ‘curative factors’ (e.g. universality, which describes the process of patients realizing that they are
not alone in having particular problems).

Family therapy
Instead of focusing on the individual patient, this form
of therapy treats the family as a whole. It may include
just parents and siblings or extended family. It is hoped
that improved family communication and conflict resolution will result in an improvement in the patient’s
symptoms. Similarly to group therapy, there are many
different orientations, most notably the psychodynamic, structural and systemic approaches.

Milieu therapy (therapeutic
community)
Therapeutic communities are cohesive residential communities that consist of a group of about 30 patients
who are resident for between 9 and 18 months. During
this time, residents are encouraged to take responsibility
for themselves and others (e.g. by allowing them to be
involved in running the unit). They may be useful for
patients with personality disorders (especially borderline personality disorder) and behavioural problems.

The psychological treatment options for specific conditions have been discussed in each of the relevant chapters
in these conditions. The main treatment options with
the strongest evidence base, along with relevant crossreferences, have been summarized in Figure 3.7. Note,
however, that the lack of evidence for certain psychological treatments does not mean that they are not effective.

Therapy type

Description

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)

Uses a combination of cognitive and behavioural therapies, with some relaxation
techniques from Zen Buddhism. It involves both individual and group therapy,
and can be helpful in reducing self-harming and improving functioning

Eye movement desensitization and
reprocessing (EMDR)

At the same time as giving attention to difficult (usually traumatic) memories,
the therapist encourages eye movement. This is thought to utilize both sides
of the brain, and aid reprocessing of memories

Mentalization-based therapy (MBT)

Developed from psychodynamic therapy, and focuses on allowing patients to
better understand what is going on both in their own minds and in the
minds of others. It can utilize both individual and group components

Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)

CAT aims to help the patient understand the problematic roles that they
repeatedly find themselves and others in, and the (dysfunctional) ways they
cope with this. The aim is to increase the patient’s flexibility in ways of relating,
and to find ‘exits’ from dysfunctional patterns. The focus is on helping with
present circumstances, while understanding from the past how things
have arisen

Mindfulness-based cognitive
therapy (MCBT)

Utilizes traditional CBT methods in conjunction with mindfulness and
meditation. Mindfulness focuses on becoming aware of thoughts and feelings
and accepting them, rather than reacting to them

to be at risk of self-harm, suicide, self-neglect, exploitation, or may place others at risk. The very nature of mental disorders can affect some patients’ ability to make
decisions regarding their care and treatment: in these instances, decisions may need to be made without the informed consent or agreement of the patient. Mental
health legislation is therefore in place for the purpose
of protecting patients and the public.
Differing legal systems within the UK mean that
there are differences in mental health legislation across
the home nations. This book will focus on mental
health legislation applicable in England and Wales.

MENTAL HEALTH ACT 1983 AS
AMENDED BY MENTAL HEALTH
ACT 2007
In England and Wales, the Mental Health Act 1983 as
amended by the Mental Health Act 2007 (MHA) provides a legal framework for the care and treatment of individuals with mental disorders. The MHA is divided
into a number of parts, each of which is divided into
‘Sections’ (groups of paragraphs).

Part I: definitions
The term ‘mental disorder’ is defined as any disorder or
disability of the mind. However, the Learning Disability
Qualification states that a person with a learning disability (intellectual disability) alone can only be detained for
treatment or be made subject to Guardianship if that learning
disability (intellectual disability) is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct.

The Appropriate Medical Treatment test stipulates
that for longer term powers of compulsion (i.e. longer
than 28 days) it is not possible for patients to be compulsorily detained or treated unless ‘medical treatment’
is available and appropriate. Medical treatment includes
not only medication but psychological treatment, nursing and specialist mental health habilitation and
rehabilitation.
Certain officials and bodies are designated to carry
out specific duties related to implementation of the
MHA. Some of these are summarized in Figure 4.1.
HINTS AND TIPS
Note that the Mental Health Act 1983 does not regard
dependence on alcohol or drugs alone as evidence of a
mental disorder. However, mental disorders which
arise secondary to substance intoxication or withdrawal
(e.g. delirium tremens, drug induced psychosis) are
covered by the MHA.

Part II: civil Sections
Part II of the MHA relates to compulsory assessment and
treatment, both in hospital and in the community.
Figure 4.2 summarizes the most important Sections in
this part.
Normally, the process starts because concerns are
raised about an individual’s mental health. Following
assessment by the appropriate professionals, the patient
may be admitted to hospital under Section 2 or 3 of
the MHA.
In an emergency, it may not be possible to arrange
review for consideration of Section 2 or 3. In these
cases, there are various options available, depending on

Mental health and the law
Fig. 4.1 Mental Health Act (MHA) officials

Official or body

Description

Approved Mental Health
Practitioner (AMHP)

A mental health professional (nurse, social worker, occupational therapist,
clinical psychologist) with specialist training in mental health assessment and
legislation, approved by the local authority. Duties of an AMHP include assessing
patients, and (if appropriate) making an application for MHA detention

Section 12 approved doctor

A doctor approved under Section 12 of the MHA as having expertise in the
diagnosis and treatment of mental disorder. Section 12 doctors are responsible
for the assessment of patients, and to provide a recommendation for MHA
detention if appropriate

Approved Clinician (AC) and
Responsible Clinician (RC)

A healthcare professional (usually a doctor, but can also be a nurse, social
worker, occupational therapist, clinical psychologist) who has received
specialist training, and is responsible for the treatment of individuals with
mental disorder detained under the MHA. An AC in charge of the care of a
specific patient is known as Responsible Clinician (RC) for that patient. Their
responsibility is to oversee the care and treatment of a patient detained under
the MHA, and to remain responsible for administrative duties of the MHA
pertinent to the patient

Second Opinion Approved Doctor
(SOAD)

Appointed by the CQC (see below), the role of the SOAD is to provide an
independent second medical opinion regarding treatment in patients subject to
prolonged compulsory treatment who are unable to consent to their treatment,
or when a patient refuses electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (not applicable in
emergency situations, see ‘consent to treatment’ p. 36)

Nearest Relative (NR)

The spouse, child, parent, sibling, or other relative of a patient detained under
the MHA. This sometimes varies from ‘next of kin’. It is the duty of the AMHP to
appoint the nearest relative, although this decision can be appealed in court.
AMHPs have a duty to inform the NR of the application for MHA detention.
NRs can – in some instances – apply for the patient to be discharged from
compulsory measures

Independent Mental Health
Advocates (IMHA)

Advocacy is a process of supporting and enabling people to express their views
and concerns, access information and services, defend and promote their rights
and responsibilities, and explore choices and options. Most patients detained
under the MHA have the right to access an independent mental health
advocate

Care Quality Commission (CQC)

An independent health and social care regulatory body which oversees the use
of the MHA, and ensures standards are maintained. All NHS and social care
providers involved with the care of patients detained under the MHA require to
be registered with the CQC

Mental Health Review Tribunal
(MHRT)

MHRTs hear appeals against detention under the MHA. Their members include
a lawyer, a doctor and a layperson. MHRTs have the authority to discharge
patients from compulsory measures when they determine that the conditions
for detention are not met

Mental Health Act Managers
(‘hospital managers’)

Represent the hospital responsible for a detained patient. Hospital managers will
hear appeals from patients against their detention and review renewals of
lengthy detentions. Cases are heard in similar settings to those heard by MHRTs,
and Mental Health Act Managers have the authority to discharge patients

circumstances. When any emergency measure is used to
detain a patient, this should be reviewed as soon as possible by the appropriate professionals and compulsory
measures either revoked, or a Section 2 or 3 granted.
Under Section 135, an Approved Mental Health Practitioner (AMHP) may apply to a magistrate for a warrant, which allows the police to enter private premises
in order to remove someone with a possible mental

34

disorder and take them to a ‘place of safety’ (usually a
police station or hospital) for further assessment.
Section 136 similarly applies when a police officer has
concerns about an individual in a public place; however, the police officer need not apply for a warrant.
Patients admitted to hospital on an involuntary basis
are informed of their detention and their rights. They
may apply to have their case reviewed by a Mental

power to remove the detention. Patients may also be

to do this is blocked by the RC).
For patients liable to be detained under Section 3, it
may be appropriate to consider the use of a Community
Treatment Order (CTO) under Section 17 of the MHA.

This can be useful when treatment in the community is
an option (i.e. when the associated risks of the mental
disorder do not necessitate ongoing hospital admission). Conditions such as attending appointments
may be enforced; however, specific treatment cannot
be forcibly given. CTO allows the Responsible Clinician
to recall the patient to hospital should the patient become non-concordant with treatment, or should they
become unwell.

Mental health and the law
HINTS AND TIPS
Note that the term ‘informal’ applies to hospital
patients who not are detained under the MHA (i.e.
patients who have agreed to voluntary admission).
About 90% of psychiatric admissions are on an
informal basis.

HINTS AND TIPS
Section 5(2) – doctor’s holding power – may be
enacted by any hospital doctor provided they are
either the responsible clinician or another doctor
nominated by them (e.g. a specialist registrar or senior
house officer). This means that a psychiatrist need not
see suspected mentally ill patients on a medical or
surgical ward before they can be detained under this
Section.

Part III: forensic Sections
Part III of the MHA incorporates Sections 35–55 and relates to mentally ill patients involved in criminal proceedings or under sentence. Figure 4.3 summarizes
the most important sections in this part. It should be
noted that patients who are detained under certain forensic Sections, and who are not ‘restricted’ patients

(see Fig. 4.3) can be considered for supervised community treatment (CTO) if appropriate.

Part IV: consent to treatment
This part of the MHA clarifies the extent to which treatments can be imposed on patients subject to compulsory measures. Patients detained under Section 3 or
37 (long-term treatment orders) may be treated with
standard psychiatric medication for 3 months with or
without their consent. However, after 3 months and
in other special cases, an extra Section from a Second
Opinion Approved Doctor (SOAD) is required for
treatment. These include:
• Psychosurgery and surgical implants of hormones to
reduce sex drive. These require the informed consent
of a patient with capacity to make such a decision, as
well as the approval of a SOAD, under Section 57 of
the MHA. Neither of these procedures can be carried
out on a patient who lacks capacity to make these
decisions.
• Administration of medical treatment in a patient
who cannot provide, or refuses to provide, informed
consent requires the approval of a SOAD, under
Section 58 of the MHA.
• If the patient is ‘capable of understanding the nature,
purpose and likely effects of the treatment’ then electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) cannot be given without his consent. If the patient lacks capacity, then
ECT must be certified as ‘appropriate’ by a SOAD,
under Section 58A of the MHA.

only be applied by an Approved Medical Practitioner in
agreement with a MHO. Patients may be given treatment for their mental disorder under a STDO. Patients
have a right to appeal the STDO at any time, with their
appeal being heard at a tribunal. The STDO may either
be revoked, or an application for a Compulsory Treatment Order made.

Compulsory Treatment Order
MENTAL HEALTH (CARE &
TREATMENT) (SCOTLAND)
ACT 2003
Compulsory measures in Scotland are legislated for by
the Mental Health (Care & Treatment) (Scotland) Act
2003. They can be used when a patient is suffering (or
thought to be suffering) from a mental disorder (mental
illness, intellectual disability, personality disorder), by
virtue of which the individual’s ability to make decisions
about treatment of their mental disorder is significantly
impaired, treatment for the mental disorder (including
medication, nursing and psychosocial care) is available,
and without treatment there would be considerable risk
to the health, safety or welfare of the individual, or to the
safety of others. Also, the use of compulsory powers must
be necessary and lesser restrictive options inappropriate.
The use of the Act is overseen by the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland. Under civil law, the following
orders are frequently used:

Emergency Detention Order
An Emergency Detention Order (EDO) allows an individual with a mental disorder (or suspected mental
disorder) to be detained in hospital for up to 72 hours,
where hospital admission is required urgently for assessment, and when application for a Short Term Detention
Order would cause undesirable delay. Any doctor (with
full GMC registration) can implement an EDO. Wherever possible, the agreement of a mental health officer
(MHO – usually a social worker specially trained in
mental health) should also be obtained. Patients may
not be treated against their will under an EDO, but emergency treatment is possible under common law. It should
be reviewed as soon as practical by an Approved Medical
Practitioner (a psychiatrist with special training and approval in the use of the Mental Health (Care & Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003), and should either be
revoked, or converted to a Short Term Detention Order.

Short Term Detention Order
A Short Term Detention Order (STDO) allows an individual with a mental disorder (or suspected mental disorder) to be detained in hospital for up to 28 days. It can

A Compulsory Treatment Order (CTO) usually follows
an STDO. An MHO applies to the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland, asking them to consider granting a
CTO. This requires two written medical reports, usually
completed by the Responsible Medical Officer (the
Approved Medical Practitioner responsible for the care
of the patient) and the patient’s general practitioner
(GP). It also requires a proposed care plan, detailing
medical treatment that would be provided if the CTO
is granted. The tribunal consists of a lawyer, a doctor
and a layperson, who decide whether the application
is appropriate, before either granting the CTO,
refusing the CTO, or suggesting an interim order while
further information is gathered. A CTO lasts for
6 months initially; however, applications can be made
to the Mental Health Tribunal to extend this. Patients
have the right of appeal. CTOs can be used to treat
patients in the community as well as in hospital.

MENTAL HEALTH (NORTHERN
IRELAND) ORDER 1986
The Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 is
similar to the Mental Health Act of England and Wales,
although there are some noteworthy differences:
• Unlike other UK mental health legislation, the order
defines mental illness: “Mental illness” means ‘a
state of mind which affects a person’s thinking, perceiving, emotion or judgement to the extent that he
requires care or medical treatment in his own interests or the interest of other persons.’
• The various paragraphs are referred to as Articles, not
Sections.
• The order does not allow for the detention of individuals with personality disorder, although individuals may be detained when a personality disorder
coexists with mental illness or severe mental
impairment.
• There is only one procedure for admission to hospital: All patients compulsorily admitted to hospital
will be held for a period of assessment lasting up
to 14 days. Following this, they may be detained under Article 12, which allows detention for treatment
for up to 6 months beginning with the date of

37

Mental health and the law
admission. The application for assessment is made
by the nearest relative or an approved social worker,
and is followed by a medical recommendation, usually by the patient’s GP. The order stipulates that a
patient admitted for assessment should be examined
by a consultant psychiatrist within 48 hours after admission, and, if detained under Article 12, examined
by a consultant psychiatrist during both the first and
second 7 days of the assessment period.

CAPACITY TO CONSENT
TO TREATMENT
Mental capacity is defined as the ability of an individual
to make their own decisions, and is defined by the
Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA). An individual (aged
16 years or older) has capacity to make a specific decision if they can:
• Understand information given to them to make a
particular decision.
• Retain that information.
• Use or weigh up the information to make the decision.
• Communicate their decision.
If an individual is unable to do one or more of the
above, they lack the capacity to make the particular decision in question.
It should be noted that ‘capacity’ is not a blanket
term, and that it should be considered on a decisionby-decision basis. For example, a lady with a moderate
intellectual disability may have capacity to decide to buy
a CD by her favourite singer; however, at the same time
she may lack capacity to make a decision to take out a
mortgage to buy a house.
Under the MCA, an individual:
• Must be assumed to have capacity until it is established that they lack capacity.
• Should not be treated as incapable until all practical
steps to help them have been taken without success.
• Must not be treated as incapable merely on the basis
of wishing to make an unwise decision.
Any act done, or decision made under the MCA:
• Must be in the best interests of the individual.
• Must be undertaken in a manner that is least restrictive to the individual’s rights.
The framework used to assess mental capacity in Scotland
is the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. In
Northern Ireland, decision making ability is governed
by common law.
With regard to medical treatment, clinicians should
provide patients with a clear explanation of the nature
and likely benefits of a treatment as well as its potential
risks and side-effects. An adult who has capacity has the

38

right to refuse treatment, even if this refusal results in
death or serious disability. When patients refuse essential treatment, clinicians should ascertain whether they
have the capacity to consent to treatment and have
made a free decision without coercion.
When making decisions about capacity, you should
not hesitate to discuss the case with colleagues, or even a
medicolegal defence organization. The process of assessment should be clearly and comprehensively documented in the medical notes.

Advance Decisions
An Advance Decision (or ‘living will’) is a statement of
an individual’s wishes regarding the healthcare and medical treatment they would wish to have (or not wish to
have), if they were to become incapable of making decisions on these matters in the future. The individual must
be over the age of 18, and must have capacity to make the
statement. The Advance Decision can become valid
when the individual loses capacity to consent to (or
refuse) treatment in the future. Advance Decisions are legally enforceable under the MCA in England and Wales.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the equivalent of
an Advance Decision is called an ‘Advance Directive’.
These are not considered under mental health legislation, and are not legally enforceable. However, respecting the advance refusal of a competent adult is a
requirement of Articles 5 and 8 of the Human Rights
Act 1998. The wishes of the individual should be taken
into consideration when acting or making a decision on
their behalf.

Proxy decision making
A Power of Attorney is a legal document that enables an
individual (who has capacity and is over the age of 18) to
nominate another person (‘Attorney’) to make decisions
on their behalf in the event that they become incapable
of doing so in the future. The decisions allowed to be
made may be specified, and may include healthcare, welfare and financial matters. If the individual lacks capacity
and has not made a Power of Attorney, it is possible for
the courts to appoint these powers to individuals. Laws
regarding Power of Attorney vary between England and
Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
COMMUNICATION
• Having a serious mental illness does not preclude a
patient from having the capacity to consent to
physical treatment, as long as their illness does not
interfere with their understanding of relevant
information and the decision making process.

Human rights legislation

• The Mental Health Acts make provision for the
compulsory treatment of mental disorders only, not
for the compulsory treatment of physical disorders.
Therefore, a patient can never be detained under the
MHA to treat a physical disorder, and patients are
within their rights to refuse physical treatment as long
as they are deemed to have capacity. Patients who
require urgent physical treatment, but who do not
have capacity, may be treated without their consent
(but in their best interests) under the Mental Capacity
Act 2005.

COMMON LAW
Common law refers to law that is based on previous
court decisions (case law), rather than laws made in Parliament (statute law). The Mental Health Act is an example of statutory law, whereas providing immediate lifesaving treatment to an unconscious patient (unable to
consent) is justified under common law.
Many doctors and nurses who are not familiar with
mental health legislation are often concerned about infringing patients’ rights, and may not act at all (e.g. a
man with a life-threatening alcohol withdrawal delirium is allowed to leave the ward with no one attempting
to stop him).
The common law doctrine of necessity allows for treatment of physical or mental disorders in adults who are unable to consent in emergency situations. Treatment must
be in the best interests of the individual, and must be
necessary to sustain life, to prevent serious deterioration
or to alleviate severe pain or suffering. The doctrine of necessity is applicable only in emergency situations, and – if
necessary – treatment should be continued under statute
law (e.g. MHA, MCA) as soon as practically possible.
When considering an action under common law, always ask yourself whether your actions would be defensible in court. Your actions should be consistent with what
most individuals with your level of training would do in
the same situation. Choosing not to act when you should
is indefensible, and would be construed as negligent.
HINTS AND TIPS
It is permissible under common law to restrain and
medicate patients who are mentally disordered and
who present an imminent danger to themselves or
others. However, it is bad practice to repeatedly impose
psychiatric medication on informal patients. They
should be assessed and treated under the appropriate
Section of the Mental Health Act.

HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION
Human rights are commonly understood as ‘inalienable
fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being’. The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights was established
in 1948, and subsequently the European Convention
on Human Rights (ECHR) in 1953. These are considered to be international law. The UK has introduced
its own statute law, the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA).
There are some fundamental incompatibilities between the Human Rights Act 1998 and mental health
legislation. The Mental Health Act 2007 has gone some
way to address these; however, it is still important to be
aware of some important aspects of human rights
legislation.
Article 3 of the ECHR states that ‘no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment’. This is an absolute right, and is always
applicable. When a patient is in hospital (whether
detained or not), practices that could be considered to
be ‘inhuman or degrading’ may include the use of excessive force during restraint, maintaining high levels of sedation to compensate for staff shortages, a lack of
privacy or adequate sanitation, or treatment without
consent in cases where it is not medically necessary (under common law or under the MHA). Public authorities
have a duty under the HRA to protect the human rights
of patients in their care.
Article 8 of the ECHR protects the right to respect for
private and family life, home and correspondence. It
also sets out, in general terms, circumstances when an
interference (also known as a restriction) with this right
is acceptable. However, interference must be lawful,
necessary and proportionate. Under mental health legislation, seclusion (keeping and supervising a patient
alone in a room that may be locked) can occasionally
be used; however, if this is not justified as being lawful,
necessary and proportionate, it may be a violation of the
human rights of the patient.
Article 5 of the ECHR protects the right to liberty;
however, it also sets out specific circumstances in which
this can be limited. Inappropriate use of the MHA (including undue delays in tribunal or appeal processes)
can result in an unlawful restriction of liberty, which
may be in violation of Article 5 of the ECHR.
There are also instances when failure to appropriately
use mental health legislation may be considered to be in
violation of an individual’s human rights. Article 2 of
the ECHR is an absolute right to life, and professionals
or authorities who fail to protect life may be considered
to be in violation of the law (e.g. failing to detain a
severely depressed and suicidal patient who later completed suicide was considered by the UK Supreme Court
to be a violation of Article 2 of the ECHR).

39

Mental health and the law
As exemplified, the interface between mental health
legislation and human rights legislation is incredibly
complex, and beyond the scope of this book to discuss
in detail. However, it is important to be mindful of human rights law and these potential difficulties, and to
seek advice from an expert if in doubt.

FITNESS TO DRIVE
Both mental illness and psychiatric medication can impair fitness to drive. Clinicians should be aware of the
following legal provisions:
• It is the responsibility of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) to make the decision as
to whether an individual is fit to continue driving.

40

• It is the driver’s responsibility to inform the DVLA
of any condition that may impair his/her driving
ability.
• It is the doctor’s responsibility to advise patients to
inform the DVLA of any condition that may interfere
with their driving (e.g. psychotic episode, manic episode, dementia). Doctors may be contacted by the
DVLA for further clinical information, or invited to
prepare a medical report.
• Doctors may, and indeed have a duty to, breach confidentiality considerations and contact the DVLA
medical advisor themselves if patients fail to take
this advice and the potential impairment is serious.
The same applies to patients who, due to their illness
(e.g. dementia, psychosis), are unable, or unlikely,
to contact the DVLA.

HISTORY
Until the 18th century, the mentally ill in the UK received no formal psychiatric care, and those who were
not looked after by their families were kept in workhouses and private institutions. In 1845, the Lunatics
Act led to the building of an asylum in every county
so that those patients with severe mental illness could
be cared for in large remote asylum communities. Since
the introduction in the 1950s of chlorpromazine, the
first effective medication for schizophrenia, there has
been a significant decline in the numbers of patients
in psychiatric hospitals. The attempts to reduce the cost
of in-patient care, and the criticism levelled at asylums
regarding the ‘institutionalization’ of patients and the
loss of patient autonomy, led to the closure of the large
asylums and the rise of community care. Today, most
mentally ill patients are assessed and managed in the
community and hospital admission, when indicated,
is usually only brief in duration.

PRIMARY CARE
Up to 95% of mental illness is seen and managed exclusively in primary care by general practitioners (GPs),
with mild to moderate mood and anxiety disorders
and alcohol abuse being the most common conditions.
Depression, which is the most common mental illness
treated, is frequently associated with symptoms of anxiety as well as physical complaints.

It is important to note that up to half of all mentally
ill patients go undetected in primary care. This is because many of these patients present with physical,
rather than psychological, symptoms. Also, some patients are reluctant to discuss emotional issues with their
doctor, due to feelings of embarrassment or uncertainty
about how they will be received.
Some GPs have the option of referring patients with
mild symptoms or those going through a life crisis (e.g.
bereavement) to a practice counsellor (see p. 25). Practice and district nurses may be helpful in screening for,
and educating patients about, mental illness.
Primary care liaison teams exist in many areas. These
act as a single point of contact for GPs to refer to. Referrals are allocated to psychiatrists, psychologists, community mental health nurses (CPNs) or occupational
therapists as appropriate. This means the GP does not
have to work out which professional is best placed to
help the patient before referring; the team can discuss
this among themselves. Some patients will continue
to receive intervention at a primary care level and others
will require secondary care. Figure 5.1 lists the common
reasons for referral from primary to secondary mental
health care.

• Uncertainty regarding diagnosis
• Poor response to standard treatment, despite adequate
dose and compliance
• Specialist treatment required, e.g. psychological therapy, specialist medication regimens

teams (CMHTs), which consist of a multidisciplinary team
of psychiatrists, CPNs, social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists and support workers. Team members
usually operate from a base which is easily accessible
to the community they serve, although local GP surgeries
are also used to see patients. Patients who are unable to
come to the CMHT member’s location are often seen
at home.

Care programme approach
The approach taken by the secondary psychiatric services is called the care programme approach (CPA), introduced by the Department of Health in 1991. This
approach applies to all patients under specialist psychiatric care and includes community-, hospital- and
prison-based patients. The key components of the
CPA are:
• The systematic assessment of patients’ health and social care needs.
• The formation of an agreed care plan which addresses these identified needs.
• The allocation of a care coordinator (previously called
‘keyworker’) to keep in touch with the patient to
monitor and coordinate the care of these needs. This
is usually a CPN, social worker or psychiatrist.
• Regular review meetings, which include all relevant
professionals, patients and their carers, to adjust the
care plan, if necessary.
Patients may be placed on a standard or enhanced CPA
according to the severity of their needs.

HINTS AND TIPS
The diverse and multiple needs of patients with mental
health problems make a multidisciplinary approach
indispensable in psychiatry. A multidisciplinary team
consists of members with medical, psychological, social
and occupational therapy expertise.

Out-patient clinics
Psychiatric out-patient clinics take place in CMHT centres, GP surgeries and hospital buildings. Types of clinics
include psychiatrist’s clinics for new referrals and followup patients, and special purpose clinics (e.g. depot injections clinics, clozapine monitoring clinics).

Day hospitals
Day hospitals are non-residential units that patients attend during the day. They are an alternative to in-patient
care for patients who, although distressed, are able to go
home in the evening and on weekends. Having a supportive family is helpful in this regard. They may also
be used for patients who have just been discharged from
hospital, but who still need a high level of support, as a
form of ‘partial hospitalization’. They are now mainly
used for older adults.

Assertive outreach teams
These are like CMHTs and involve a multidisciplinary
team but provide a more intensive service, providing
more flexible and frequent patient contact. They are targeted at challenging patients who have not engaged well
with mainstream mental health services in the past. The
patients who use this service often have histories of severe and enduring mental illness, significant social
problems and complex needs and are at high risk. The
nature of their illness requires more focused and intensive input.

Home treatment teams
There is increasing emphasis on treating patients at
home, and avoiding expensive and disruptive in-patient
admissions. A hospital admission can be very challenging for anyone, particularly someone with an acute
mental illness. Treatment at home also allows practical
problems with housing and activities of daily living to
be better identified and addressed. Most regions now
have home treatment teams (also called crisis teams)
who can provide short periods of support (a few days
to weeks) to people who might otherwise have to be admitted. They can also facilitate earlier discharge than
would otherwise be possible. Such teams include similar professionals to a CMHT but generally are available
out of hours and can visit patients more often (e.g. multiple times per day, if required). Medication, practical
help and psychological therapy can be offered.

Early intervention in psychosis
teams
There is some evidence that the longer a psychotic episode goes untreated, the poorer the prognosis, suggesting

Secondary care
that early treatment is preferable. However, not all mild
or vague symptoms of possible psychosis go on to become a definite psychotic episode, meaning it can be
hard to know when to start treatment (e.g. a person
who is suspicious of others, but not holding a certain
belief of persecution). Specialist teams exist in many regions to manage such cases, offering assessment, medication, psychological strategies and education for patients
and families. Teams are open to psychosis secondary to
any diagnosis (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance-induced) and generally accept people aged 14–35
years.

In-patient units
Occasionally, community care is not possible and
hospital admission is necessary. Reasons for admission
include the following:
• To provide a safe environment when there is: (1)
high risk of harm to self or others, or (2) grossly disturbed behaviour.
• A period of in-patient assessment is needed (e.g. of
response to treatment or when the diagnosis is
uncertain).
• It is necessary to institute treatment in hospital
(e.g. electroconvulsive therapy, clozapine therapy –
although both of these can be initiated as out-patients
if the patient is at low risk of complications).

5

There are various types of in-patient units. These range
from a general adult acute ward for uncomplicated admissions to psychiatric intensive care units (PICUs) for
severely disturbed patients who cannot be adequately
contained on an open ward. High security units (also
called ‘special hospitals’, e.g. Broadmoor, Rampton)
are for mentally ill offenders who pose a grave risk to
others.

Rehabilitation units
These units aim to reintegrate patients whose social and
living skills have been severely handicapped by the effects of severe mental illness and institutionalization
into the community. Admissions are often for months
to years. The approach taken is holistic, and uses the ‘Recovery Model’, i.e. learning to live well with ongoing
symptoms, rather than aim for complete remission of
symptoms.

Accommodation
Certain patients, who are unable to live independently
due to severe and enduring mental illness, may need
supported accommodation. Types of supported accommodation range from warden-controlled property to
homes with trained staff on hand 24 hours a day.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The definitions of self-harm, suicide and attempted suicide
• The risk factors that must always be assessed
• The importance of exploring alcohol and substance misuse in the suicidal patient

Case summary
The duty psychiatrist is asked for his opinion on Mr SA,
a 28-year-old unemployed, recently divorced man,
who was brought in by his landlord. The landlord had
called round on the off-chance to discuss payment
arrears, only to find the door unlocked and Mr SA
asleep on his bed with an empty box of paracetamol
tablets and several empty cans of lager littered around
the floor. He also found a hastily scribbled suicide note
on the bedside table, addressed to Mr SA’s children.
Mr SA was easily roused but was upset to have been
found and initially refused the landlord’s persistent
pleas that they should go along to the hospital. Only
when he was violently sick did he finally agree.
The doctor in the accident and emergency (A&E)
department reports that, other than the smell of alcohol
on his breath, Mr SA’s medical examination was normal.
Blood tests revealed raised paracetamol levels, but these
were not sufficiently high to require medical admission.
The A&E doctor is concerned because Mr SA is
ambivalent about further acts of self-harm or suicide,
saying that his ‘life is a failure’ and that ‘there is nothing
worth living for’. Before coming to see the patient, the
duty psychiatrist proceeds to ask the A&E doctor some
routine questions.

(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

While many psychiatric illnesses can be associated with
self-harm or suicidal intent (both as a presenting feature
and a chronic symptom), many patients who self-harm
or attempt suicide are not previously known to mental
health services. Assessments of these patients are often
made by non-psychiatric staff and so it is vital that

primary care clinicians are, firstly, able to detect and
manage any underlying mental illness and, secondly,
have a sound approach to assessing and managing risk.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
Self-harm is a blanket term used to describe any intentional act done with the knowledge that it is potentially
harmful. It can take the form of self-poisoning (overdosing) or self-injury (cutting, burning, hitting). The motives for self-harm are vast and include emotional
relief, self-punishment, attention seeking, and can even
be a form of self-help (albeit maladaptive) by way of
channelling an intolerable emotional experience into a
discrete physical sensation. Suicide is the act of intentionally and successfully ending one’s own life. Attempted
suicide refers to an unsuccessful suicide bid.
HINTS AND TIPS
Self-harm is one of the top five reasons for acute
medical admissions for both men and women in the
UK. In addition, it is estimated that a large number of
people do not attend hospital following self-harm.

ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS WHO
HAVE INFLICTED HARM UPON
THEMSELVES
Patients who present with self-harm have a 100-fold
greater chance of completing suicide in the following year
in comparison to the general population, emphasizing
the need for comprehensive risk assessment. It is incredibly difficult reliably to predict suicide, but numerous

Risk factors for suicide

Epidemiological factors:
Male of any age (although younger females more
likely to self-harm)
Being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (particularly
younger people)
Prisoners (especially remand)
Being unmarried (single, widowed, divorced)
Unemployment
Working in certain occupations (farmer, vet, nurse,
doctor)
Low socioeconomic status
Living alone, social isolation
Clinical factors:
Psychiatric illness or personality disorder (see Fig. 6.2)
Previous self-harm
Alcohol dependence
Physical illness (especially debilitating, chronically
painful, or terminal conditions)
Family history of depression, alcohol dependence or
suicide
Recent adverse life-events (especially bereavement)

studies have shown that certain epidemiological and clinical variables are more prevalent among those who have
completed suicide (Fig. 6.1) and it is important to bear
these in mind when assessing risk. No patient questionnaire or suicide risk scoring system has been shown to
be better than thorough clinical assessment.
The key areas to assess are:
1. Suicide risk factors.
2. Suicidal intent (including circumstances surrounding the act).
3. Mental state examination.
4. Current social support.
HINTS AND TIPS
Suicide remains the most common cause of death for
men and women under the age of 35 years.

HINTS AND TIPS
One way to remember to ask for suicide risk factors is
to learn them as a list, and screen for them fairly early
in the assessment.

Psychiatric illness
About 90% of patients who commit suicide have a diagnosed or retrospectively diagnosable mental disorder.
However, only around a quarter have contact with mental health services in the year before completing suicide.
Patients recently discharged from in-patient psychiatric
care are at an elevated risk of suicide, particularly for
the first couple of weeks. Figure 6.2 summarizes the
most important psychiatric conditions associated with
suicide.
COMMUNICATION
Every patient with suicidal ideas, no matter how
unlikely it seems, should be asked about alcohol or
substance misuse. Taking a non-judgemental stance is
likely to enhance the therapeutic relationship, and help
the patient feel understood.

Physical illness
Many disabling or unpleasant medical conditions can
be associated with self-harm and suicide. Often, a patient may have comorbid depression that will respond
to treatment. However, a minority have no mental illness and make a ‘rational’ decision to die. The most
common examples are:
• Chronic and painful illnesses.
• Central nervous system diseases (e.g. epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease).
• Cancer (especially of the genitals or breast).
• Endocrine and metabolic conditions (e.g. Cushing’s
disease, porphyria).

Recent adverse life events
COMMUNICATION
Suicidal patients often feel distressed and guilty. One of
the most important therapeutic aspects of the
assessment is to convey empathy and optimism.

Suicide risk factors
Figure 6.1 summarizes the most important epidemiological and clinical risk factors for suicide.

46

Stressful life events are more common in the 6 months
prior to a suicide attempt, and include relationship
break-ups, health problems, legal/financial difficulties,
or problems at home or within the family.

Suicidal intent
Suicidal intent, which is commonly defined as the seriousness or intensity of the wish of a patient to terminate
his or her life, is suggested by the following:

The attempt was planned in advance

Mental state examination

A lethal suicide attempt typically involves days or weeks
of planning. It is rarely an impulsive, spur-of-themoment idea (the exception is the psychotic patient
who impulsively responds to hallucinations or delusions). Planning is strongly suggested by the evidence
of final acts. These include the making of a will or the
leaving of a suicide note.

This should ideally be conducted in a calm, quiet and
confidential setting, preferably when the patient has
had a chance to rest and is not under the influence of
drugs or alcohol. Check specifically for:

Precautions were taken to avoid discovery
or rescue
For example, a patient might check into a hotel room in
a distant town or ensure that no friends or family will be
visiting over the ensuing hours or days.

A dangerous method was used
Violent methods (hanging, jumping from heights, firearm use) are suggestive of lethal intent. That said, use
of an apparently ineffective method (e.g. taking six
paracetamol tablets) might reflect lack of knowledge
of the lethal dose needed, rather than a lack of intent
to die. Therefore, it should be ascertained whether the
method used was seen as dangerous from the patient’s
perspective.

No help was sought after the act
Patients who immediately regret their action and seek
help are probably less at risk than those who do not seek
help and wait to die.

• Current mood state: does the patient appear to be
suffering from a depressive illness? Assess for features of hopelessness, worthlessness or agitation
(all of which are associated with a higher risk of
completed suicide).
• Other psychiatric illness: does the patient appear
preoccupied, delusional or responding to hallucinations? Is there evidence of eating disorder, substance
abuse or cognitive impairment?
• Current suicidality: is the act now regretted, or is
there strong intent to die? What does the patient
plan to do if discharged?
• Protective factors: what aspects of the patient’s life
(family, children and dependents) would guard
against further acts? Lack of protective factors, or dismissal of their importance, is a worrying sign.
The following questions might be helpful when asking
about suicidal ideation:
• Have you been feeling that life isn’t worth living?
• Do you sometimes feel like you would like to end
it all?
• Have you given some thought as to how you might
do it?
• How close are you to going through with your plans?
• Is there anything that might stop you from attempting suicide?

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
PATIENT MANAGEMENT
FOLLOWING SELF-HARM OR
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE
Management planning should follow assessment of risk
factors and mental state. It is important to remember
that self-harm and suicidality are not discrete illnesses,
and are instead symptoms reflecting a complex interplay of mental disorders, personality types and social
circumstances. Rather than taking the form of a prescribed care pathway, management of the suicidal or
self-harming patient requires clinical judgement, taking
into consideration the needs of the individual patient
and the availability of local resources. This can often
be anxiety provoking for healthcare workers.
Formulation of a management plan should be made
after a thorough review of any available past history, including care programmes or crisis plans. It is always desirable to obtain a collateral history from a family
member or close friend. A good plan should include
both short- and long-term management strategies.
Immediate management considerations include the
following:
• Is the patient in need of in-patient psychiatric care to
preserve their safety? If so, can this be achieved on a
voluntary basis, or is the use of mental health legislation required?
• Would the patient benefit from the input of home
treatment, outreach, or crisis teams (see Ch. 5)?
• Does the patient have existing social supports that
could be called upon?
• Reducing access to means of self-harm: does the patient have a collection of tablets or rope remaining in
their home they could dispose of? Should they be
placed on weekly dispensing of prescription
medication?
Longer term management involves the modification of
factors that could increase the risk of further acts of selfharm or suicidality, and may include:
• Treatment of psychiatric illness (medication, selfhelp, psychological therapies, community mental
health team, addiction services, out-patient appointments, GP follow-up).
• Optimizing social functioning (social work, Citizens
Advice Bureau, community groups and activities,

48

Self-harm risk assessment
Mr SA’s epidemiological risk factors are that he is a young
man, recently divorced, unemployed and apparently lives
alone in social isolation. His clinical risk factors are that he
may have alcohol problems and has recently experienced
adverse life events (divorce, financial difficulties). The evidence of final acts (suicide note) and the failure of Mr SA
to seek help after the act suggest strong suicide intent. The
fact that he would not have been discovered but for the
landlord’s timely arrival indicates a degree of forward
planning, although his leaving of the door unlocked
and his willingness to go to hospital after vomiting suggests some ambivalence. Mr SA had clearly consumed a
significant quantity of alcohol at the time of the overdose,
which could have clouded his judgement and given him
courage which he otherwise might have lacked. On mental state examination, Mr SA has ongoing suicidal ideation
and cognitive features of worthlessness and hopelessness,
which are known to be associated with suicide.

Further management
The duty psychiatrist should ask about all the epidemiological and clinical risk factors, specifically about: past
or current mental illness (is Mr SA known to the mental
health services?); previous episodes of self-harm; alcohol or substance dependence; physical illness; family
history of depression, alcohol dependence or suicide;
and recent adverse life events. The duty psychiatrist will
also be interested in Mr SA’s current social support in
order to try and help him formulate the most appropriate management plan.
As this is a complex risk assessment, the duty psychiatrist will probably have to reassess the patient himself,
especially as regards detecting mental illness on mental
state examination. The psychiatrist might ask the A&E
doctor to keep Mr SA overnight, so that a mental state
examination can be performed in the morning when
he is refreshed and no longer under the influence of alcohol. A hospital admission or follow-up by a community mental health team seems to be the most likely
outcome.
Now go on to Chapter 18 and Chapter 22 to read
about affective and personality disorders and their
management.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The definition of a depressive disorder and how this differs from sadness
• The mood symptoms of a depressive disorder
• How depressive disorders can also present with cognitive and psychotic symptoms
• The differential diagnosis of a depressive disorder
• The fact that suicidality always has to be assessed in the depressed patient
• How to assess someone complaining of depression

Case summary
Mrs LM, a 32-year-old married housewife with two
children aged 4 and 6 years, presented to her family
doctor stating that she was persistently unhappy and
had been crying repeatedly over the past few weeks.
She had no previous psychiatric history or significant
medical history and her only regular medication was
oral contraception. She had moved to the area 3 years
earlier when her husband was promoted and, at first,
appeared to have integrated well into the
neighbourhood by involving herself in the organization
of a toddlers’ group. Unfortunately, the group had
dissolved a few months ago when her co-organizer and
only close confidante had moved away. Deprived of
her most important social outlet, Mrs LM found herself
increasingly dominated by her young children.
Although usually an outgoing person, she noticed that
her motivation to keep in touch with other mothers
from the group had started to dwindle. At the same
time, she started feeling persistently weary even
though her work schedule had not increased, and often
awakened 2–3 hours earlier in the morning. Although
her appetite had not increased, she had turned to food
for ‘comfort’ and had gained over 14 lb in weight.
Mrs LM also candidly admitted that she was drinking
more alcohol than usual. She described feeling
incompetent because she was always miserable and
had become too tired to look after the children. She felt
guilty for burdening her husband and started crying
when talking about her loss of interest in sex and her
feelings of unattractiveness. Mrs LM maintained that

no aspect of her life gave her pleasure and when asked
specifically by her doctor, admitted that she had started
to wonder whether her children and husband would be
better off without her.
(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

Feeling sad or upset is a normal part of the human condition; thus, a patient presenting with emotional suffering does not necessarily warrant a psychiatric diagnosis
or require treatment. However, psychiatrists agree that
when patients present with a certain number of key depressive features, they are probably suffering from some
form of psychopathology that will require, and usually
respond to, specific kinds of treatment.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES

Core symptoms
Whereas feelings describe a short-lived emotional experience, mood refers to a patient’s sustained, subjectively
experienced emotional state over a period of time.
Patients may describe a depressed mood in a number
of ways, such as feeling sad, dejected, despondent,
‘down in the dumps’, miserable, ‘low in spirits’ or
‘heavy-hearted’. They are unable to just lift themselves
out of this mood and its severity is often out of proportion to the stressors in their surrounding social
environment.

49

The patient with low mood
HINTS AND TIPS
Low mood, loss of interest or pleasure and fatigability
are the three core symptoms of depression.

The term ‘affect’ has two uses in psychiatry. It can be
used synonymously with mood or emotion, as in the affective (mood) disorders. However, it is most often used
to describe the transient natural fluctuations of emotional state that occur from moment to moment. For example, you might notice a patient is tearful when
discussing the death of their mother but smiles when
discussing their holiday plans. The range and appropriateness of a patient’s affect is documented as part of the
mental state exam. People with depression may have a
reduced range of affect, with a monotonous voice and
minimal facial expression (see Ch. 1).
The ICD-10 classification system specifies three core
symptoms of depression:
• Depressed mood, which varies little from day to day
and is unresponsive to circumstances (although diurnal variation may be present, with mood worse
in the mornings).
• Markedly reduced interest in almost all activities, associated with the loss of ability to derive pleasure
from activities that were formerly enjoyed (partial
or complete anhedonia).
• Lack of energy or increased fatigability on minimal
exertion leading to diminished activity (anergia).
It is useful to consider the other symptoms associated
with depressed mood under the subheadings biological,
cognitive and psychotic symptoms.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember the distinction between the terms ‘mood’
and ‘affect’; they are not the same. One way to
remember the difference is that mood is like the climate
and affect like the weather.

HINTS AND TIPS
Know the biological symptoms of depression; they are
often asked for in exams. The key ones relate to
sleep and appetite.

Biological (somatic) symptoms
In the past psychiatrists used to distinguish between
‘endogenous’ or ‘reactive’ depression. ‘Endogenous’

50

depression (also called somatic, melancholic, vital or biological depression) was assumed to occur in the absence of an external environmental cause and have a
‘biological’ clinical picture. This is opposed to so-called
‘reactive’ or ‘neurotic’ depression where it is assumed
that the patient is, to some degree, understandably depressed, reacting to adverse psychosocial circumstances.
However, most depression is a mixture of the two, and
an ‘understandable depression’ does not require any
less treatment than a ‘spontaneous depression’. ‘Biological’ symptoms are still important to enquire about as if
present they suggest a more severe depression; however,
they are no longer viewed as providing information on
aetiology.

Early morning wakening
Although patients may get to off to sleep at their normal
time, they wake at least 2 hours earlier than they would
usually, and then find it impossible to get back to sleep
again. Further disturbances of sleep in depression include:
difficulty falling asleep (initial insomnia), frequent awakening during the night and excessive sleeping (hypersomnia). Although all of these contribute to the diagnosis of
depression, only early morning wakening is a biological
symptom.

Depression worse in the morning
Diurnal variation of mood means that a patient’s abnormal mood is more pronounced at a specific time of day.
A depressive mood consistently and specifically worse
in the morning is an important biological symptom.

Marked loss of appetite with weight loss
Although some depressed patients have an increased appetite and turn to ‘comfort eating’, only a dramatic
reduction in appetite with weight loss (5% of body
weight in last month) is regarded as a biological symptom. Note that the reversed biological features of overeating and oversleeping are sometimes referred to as
atypical depressive symptoms.

Psychomotor retardation or agitation
The term ‘psychomotor’ is used to describe a patient’s
motor activity as a consequence of their concurrent
mental processes. Psychomotor changes in depression
can include retardation (slow, monotonous speech,
long pauses before answering questions, or muteness;
leaden body movements and limited facial expression,
i.e. blunted affect) or conversely agitation (inability to
sit still; fidgeting, pacing or hand-wringing; rubbing
or scratching skin or clothes). Note that psychomotor

Differential diagnosis
changes must be severe enough to be observable by
others, not just the subjective experience of the patient.

Loss of libido
Sensitive questioning will often reveal a reduction in sex
drive that may lead to guilt when the sufferer feels unable to satisfy their partner.

Cognitive symptoms
Cognition has two meanings in psychiatry: it refers
broadly to brain processing functions (e.g. concentrating, learning, making decisions) and also more specifically to the thoughts patients have about themselves
and the world, which are conclusions arrived at by cognition, e.g. I failed my maths exam, therefore I will fail
all exams (see p. 28).

Reduced concentration and memory
Depressed patients report difficulty in sustaining attention while doing previously manageable tasks. They often appear easily distracted and may complain of
memory difficulties.
COMMUNICATION
Questions about concentration can include asking
if they can follow their favourite TV programme or
read a novel.

Poor self-esteem
Self-esteem includes the interrelated concepts of personal efficacy and personal worth. Depressed patients
may have thoughts that they are no longer competent
to meet life’s challenges and that they are no longer worthy of happiness and the healthy assertion of their
needs.

Guilt
Depressed patients often have guilty preoccupations
about minor past failings. This guilt is often inappropriate and out of proportion to the original ‘offence’. Patients often have guilty thoughts about the very act of
developing the depressed mood itself.

Hopelessness
Depressed patients can have bleak and pessimistic views
of the future, believing that there is no way out of their
current situation.

7

Suicide or self-harm
Depressed patients frequently have thoughts of death
and harming themselves. In severe cases suicidal ideation may lead to an actual suicide attempt. At these
times, patients may believe that they are faced with insurmountable difficulties or are trying to escape a relentlessly painful emotional state. Self-harm and suicide are
discussed fully in Chapter 6.
COMMUNICATION
Risk needs to be assessed in every patient. During
an assessment, the subject can be broached by saying
that it is common for people who are depressed to
feel that life is not worth living, and asking the patient if
this has occurred to them. Suicidality can then be
formally assessed as discussed in Chapter 6.

Psychotic symptoms
In severe depressive episodes, patients may suffer from
delusions, hallucinations or a depressive stupor; these
are termed psychotic symptoms (see Ch. 9). Delusions
and hallucinations can be classified as ‘mood congruent’ or ‘mood incongruent’, which describes whether
the content of the psychotic symptoms is consistent
with the patient’s mood. Delusions and hallucinations
in depression are generally mood congruent and so may
involve an irrational conviction of guilt or sin or the belief that parts of the body are dead or wasting away. Hallucinations may take the form of accusatory or
defamatory voices criticizing the patient in the second
person (auditory hallucination) or the smell of rotting
flesh (olfactory hallucination).
In severe episodes, psychomotor retardation may
progress to the point of unresponsiveness, lack of
voluntary movement (akinesis) and near or total mutism. Severe motor symptoms are probably more common in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder,
but they can and do occur in unipolar depression
(see page 71).

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Careful history taking and examination should reveal
whether the patient presenting with low mood is suffering from a primary mood disorder, or whether their
depression is secondary to a medical condition, psychoactive substance or other psychiatric condition.
Figure 7.1 presents the differential diagnosis. An algorithm for the diagnosis of mood disorders is presented
on page 62.

be present. A depressive episode can be graded mild,
moderate or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms. A depressive episode occurring with
hallucinations, delusions or a depressive stupor is always coded as ‘severe with psychotic features’.

Recurrent depressive disorder
Around 80% of patients who have an episode of depression will go on to have more episodes (the lifetime average is five). Recurrent depressive disorder is diagnosed
when a patient has another depressive episode after
their first.

Severe with psychotic symptoms: in cases with delusions,
hallucinations or profound psychomotor retardation

episode, and is associated with bereavement or some
other serious stress. Note that patients may develop a
depressive episode on a baseline mood of dysthymia
(so called ‘double depression’).

Bipolar affective disorder/cyclothymia
Unipolar depression means that the patient’s mood varies between depressed and normal. When patients suffer
from episodes of either depressed or elevated mood
(often, but not always, punctuated by periods of normal
mood), the disorder is termed bipolar, as the mood is
considered to deviate from normal to either a depressed
or elated (manic) pole. When this instability of mood
involves only mild elation and mild depression it is
termed cyclothymia. Bipolar illness and cyclothymia
are discussed in Chapter 8.

Dysthymia
This is a chronically depressed mood that usually has its
onset in early adulthood and may remain throughout
the patient’s life, with variable periods of wellness in between. The patient’s mood is seldom severe enough to
satisfy the formal criteria for a depressive episode and
does not present with discrete episodes as in recurrent
depressive disorder. Sometimes dysthymia has its onset
in later adult life, often after a discrete depressive

52

Schizoaffective disorder
A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder can be made
when patients present with both mood (depression or
mania) symptoms and schizophrenic symptoms within
the same episode of illness. It is important that these
symptoms occur simultaneously, or at least within a
few days of each other. As you can imagine, this is a

7

Assessment
difficult diagnosis to establish, as it is not uncommon
to have psychotic symptoms in a severe episode of depression (depressive episode with psychotic features);
likewise, depressive symptoms often occur in patients
with schizophrenia. Schizoaffective disorder is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.

Depression secondary to
psychiatric or general medical
disorders, or to psychoactive
substances
The mood disorders described above are considered
primary; however, depressive symptoms are nonspecific and can occur secondary to a range of other
conditions. For example, a patient who has schizophrenia, an anxiety disorder, a personality disorder,
an eating disorder or dementia may experience low
mood as a consequence. If the depressive symptoms
meet criteria for a depressive episode they have ‘comorbid depression’.
Many general medical conditions are associated with
an increased risk of depression (Fig. 7.3). In some cases
this may be due to a direct depressant effect on the
brain. However, any condition that causes prolonged
suffering is a risk factor for depression, for example,
chronic pain.
Both prescribed (Fig. 7.4) and illicit drugs can be
aetiologically responsible for symptoms of depression.
Remember that alcohol is the psychoactive substance
that is probably most associated with substanceinduced depression.

Low mood may be one of several symptoms that appear when a patient has had to adapt to a significant
change in life (e.g. divorce, retirement, bereavement).
If the symptoms are not severe enough to be diagnosed
as depression but are clearly related to a stressful
life event, an adjustment disorder can be diagnosed
(see Ch. 12).

ASSESSMENT

History
The following questions might be helpful in eliciting the
key symptoms of depression:

Core symptoms
• Have you been cheerful or quite low in mood or
spirits lately?
• Do you find that you no longer enjoy things the way
you used to?
• Do you find yourself often feeling very tired or
worn out?

Biological symptoms
• Do you find your mood is worse in the mornings or
evenings?
• What time did you wake up before your mood became low? What time do you wake up now?

The patient with low mood
• Has anyone mentioned you seem slowed up or
restless?
• Sometimes when people are depressed they have a
poor sex drive. Has this happened to you?

• Liver function tests and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gGT) (also a marker for high alcohol intake).
• Thyroid function tests (hyper- or hypothyroidism)
and calcium (hypercalcaemia).
If indicated:

Cognitive symptoms
• How do you see things turning out in the future?
• Do you ever feel that life’s not worth living?
• Are you able to concentrate on your favourite TV
programme?

Examination
A basic physical examination, including a thorough neurological and endocrine system examination, should be
performed on all patients with depression.

• C reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (if infection or inflammatory disease
suspected).
• Vitamin B12 and folate (if deficiencies suspected).
• Urine drug screen (if drug use is suspected).
• ECG should be done in patients with cardiac problems as tricyclic antidepressants and lithium may
prolong the QT interval and have the potential to
cause lethal ventricular arrhythmia.
• EEG (if epileptic focus or other intracranial pathology is suspected).
• CT brain scan (if evidence of neurological or cognitive deficit).

Investigations
Social
• Collateral information from general practitioner
(GP), community mental health team, family.
• Consider home visit to assess self-care, ability to care
for family, home structure.
• Consider interviewing immediate family to gain objective evidence of disturbed interpersonal family
dynamics.

Psychological
• Patient may be asked to keep a mood diary.
• Self-report inventories for quantitative ratings of
mood, e.g. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

Physical
Physical investigations are performed to: (1) exclude
possible medical or substance-related causes of depression; (2) establish baseline values before administering
treatment that may alter blood chemistry (e.g. antidepressants may cause hyponatraemia, lithium may cause
hypothyroidism); (3) assess renal and liver functioning,
which may affect the elimination of medication; and
(4) screen for the physical consequences of neglect, such
as malnutrition.
• Full blood count: check for anaemia (low haemoglobin), infection (raised white count), and a high
mean cell volume (MCV; a marker of high alcohol
intake).
• Urea and electrolytes (hyponatraemia, renal function).

54

HINTS AND TIPS
Despite much research on the dexamethasone
suppression test (DST), there is no reliable blood test to
indicate the presence of depression. However, one
biological finding that is strongly associated with
depression is a reduction in the latency (time to onset
after falling asleep) of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mrs LM meets the criteria for a depressive episode, at
least moderate in severity. She has had all three core
symptoms of depression for longer than 2 weeks: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure and fatigability. She also has biological symptoms of early morning
awakening and loss of libido. The GP has also elicited
cognitive symptoms of feelings of incompetence (reduced self-esteem) and guilt and possible thoughts of
self-harm. As this is a first episode, the diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder is not appropriate. Dysthymia is not a suitable diagnosis as the period of low
mood is far too short, the severity of the present episode
too great and the deterioration in functioning too
marked. There appear to be no instances of elated mood
or increased energy, excluding a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder or cyclothymia.
In order to grade the severity of the depression it
would be useful to enquire about all the biological, cognitive and psychotic components of depression. In all
cases of suspected depression it is imperative to enquire
about thoughts and/or plans of suicide or self-harm

Discussion of case study
(see Ch. 6 for a full discussion). It is also important to
rule out secondary causes of depression; these include
general medical conditions (Fig. 7.3), psychoactive substance use (Fig. 7.4) and other psychiatric conditions.
Mrs LM admitted to using increased quantities of
alcohol. Patients often use alcohol as a form of selfmedication to alleviate feelings of dysphoria; however,

7

alcohol can aggravate and in some cases even cause
depressive symptoms. Mrs LM’s use of oral contraception long before the onset of her depressive symptoms
suggests that it is unlikely that this prescribed drug is
causing her depression.
Now go on to Chapter 18 to read about the mood
disorders and their management.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The definitions of a hypomanic episode, a manic episode, a mixed affective episode and bipolar
affective disorder
• The mood and cognitive symptoms of a hypomanic or manic episode
• The characteristic psychotic symptoms of a manic psychosis and how they differ from schizophrenia
• The differential diagnosis of a manic episode
• How to communicate with a socially disinhibited patient
• How to assess someone presenting with elevated mood

Case summary
Feeling that she was no longer able to cope, Mrs EM
consulted her general practitioner (GP) about a
Mental Health Act assessment for her husband,
Mr EM, a 37-year-old freelance writer. He had no
psychiatric history other than a period of depression
2 years ago. He had progressively needed less sleep
over the past 2 weeks and had not slept at all for
48 hours. Recently, he had started taking on
increasing amounts of work and seemed to thrive
on this due to an ‘inexhaustible source of boundless
energy’. He told his wife and all his friends that he
had a new lease of life, as he was ‘happier than ever’.
Mrs EM became concerned when he developed
lofty ideas that he was a world expert in his field,
remaining convinced of this even when she tried to
reason with him, and would talk incessantly for hours
about elaborate and complicated writing schemes.
Mr EM’s behaviour had become markedly
uncharacteristic over the past day or two, when he
started making sexually inappropriate comments to
his neighbour’s wife, and presented her with reams of
poetry which he had spent the night writing. When
Mrs EM suggested that he visit the GP, Mr EM became
verbally aggressive saying that she was trying to bring
him down because she was threatened by his
‘irresistible sex appeal and wit’. Mrs EM was unable to
reason with him and noticed that he struggled to keep
to the point of the conversation, often bringing up
issues that seemed completely irrelevant. The GP

noted that, other than a recent bout of flu, Mr EM had
no medical problems and was not using any prescribed
medication.

(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

Just as spells of feeling sad and miserable are quite normal to the human experience, so too are periods where
we feel elated, excited and full of energy. Although an
irritable or elevated mood is not in itself pathological,
it can be when grossly and persistently so, and when associated with other manic psychopathology.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
In Chapter 7 we observed how a disturbance in mood
in addition to various other cognitive, biological and
psychotic symptoms all contribute to the recognition
of a depressive episode. A similar approach is taken
to hypomanic and manic episodes; these occur on the
opposite pole of the mood disorder spectrum to
depression.

Mood
The hallmark of a hypomanic or manic episode is an elevated or irritable mood. Patients often enjoy the experience of elevated mood and might describe themselves

57

The patient with elevated or irritable mood
as feeling: ‘high’, ‘on top of the world’, ‘fantastic’ or ‘euphoric’. This mood has an infectious quality, although
those who know the patient well clearly see it as a deviation from normal. However, some patients tend to become extremely irritable or suspicious when manic and
do not enjoy the experience at all. They have a low frustration tolerance and any thwarting of their plans can
lead to a rapid escalation in anger or even delusions
of persecution. When manic and depressive symptoms
rapidly alternate (e.g. within the same day), this is
termed a mixed affective episode.
HINTS AND TIPS
Patients with mania experience irritability (80%) or
labile or fluctuating mood (69%) just as often as
euphoria (71%).

Biological symptoms
Decreased need for sleep
This is a very important early warning sign of mania or
hypomania. Sleep disturbance can range from only
needing a few hours sleep a night to a manic patient
going for days on end with no sleep at all. Crucially,
it is not associated with fatigue.

Increased energy
This initially results in an increase in goal-directed activity and, when coupled with impaired judgement, can
have disastrous consequences, e.g. patients may instigate
numerous risky business ventures, go on excessive spending sprees, or engage in reckless promiscuity that is unusual for them. However, in severe episodes actions
can become repetitive, stereotyped and apparently purposeless, even progressing to a manic stupor in the extremely unwell. If left untreated, excessive overactivity
can lead to physical exhaustion, dehydration and sometimes even death. On mental state examination, increased energy can be seen as psychomotor excitation: the
patient is unable to sit still, frequently standing up,
pacing around the room and gesticulating expansively.

Cognitive symptoms
Elevated sense of self-esteem
or grandiosity
Hypomanic patients may overestimate their abilities
and social or financial status. In severe cases, manic
patients may have delusions of grandeur (see later).

Poor concentration
Manic patients may find it difficult to maintain their focus on any one thing as they struggle to filter out irrelevant external stimuli (background noise, other objects
or people in the room), making them, as a consequence,
highly distractible.

Accelerated thinking
A manic patient may subjectively experience their
thoughts or ideas racing even faster than they can articulate them. When patients have an irrepressible need
to express these thoughts verbally, making them difficult to interrupt, it is termed pressure of speech. When
thoughts are rapidly associating in this way in a stream
of connected (but not always relevant) concepts it is
termed flight of ideas. Some hypomanic patients express
themselves by incessant letter writing, poetry, doodling
or artwork.
COMMUNICATION
Assessing manic patients can be made difficult by
their distractibility and disinhibition. Adopt a polite but
firm approach and redirect the patient back to the
questions you need to ask.

Impaired judgement and insight
This is typical of manic illness and sometimes results in
costly indiscretions that patients may later regret. Lack
of insight into their illness can be a difficult barrier to
overcome when trying to engage patients in essential
treatment.

Psychotic symptoms
HINTS AND TIPS
Irrespective of how obvious the diagnosis might
appear, it is always important to routinely examine
for affective symptoms such as a decreased need for
sleep (81%), grandiosity (78%), racing thoughts
(71%), distractibility (68%) and sexual
disinhibition (57%).

58

Psychotic symptoms are far more common in manic
than in depressive episodes and include disorders of
thought form, thought content and perception.

Disordered thought form
Disordered thought form (see Ch. 9 and Figure 9.3)
commonly occurs in schizophrenia, but is regularly
seen in manic episodes with psychotic features and to

Differential diagnosis
a lesser degree in psychotic forms of unipolar depression. The most common thought form disorders in
mania are circumstantiality, tangentiality and flight of
ideas. However, signs of thought disorder most typical
for schizophrenia can also be seen in manic episodes,
e.g. loosening of association, neologisms and thought
blocking.

Circumstantiality and tangentiality
Circumstantial (over-inclusive) speech means speech
that is delayed in reaching its final goal because of the
over-inclusion of details and unnecessary asides and diversions; however, the speaker, if allowed to finish, does
eventually connect the original starting point to the desired destination. Circumstantiality can also be found in
normal people – most families have at least one person
who takes forever to finish a story! Tangential speech,
on the other hand, is more indicative of psychopathology and sees the speaker diverting from the initial train
of thought but never returning to the original point,
jumping tangentially from one topic to the next.

Flight of ideas
As described above, this occurs when thinking is markedly accelerated resulting in a stream of connected concepts. The link between concepts can be as in normal
communication where one idea follows directly on
from the next, or can be links that are not relevant to
an overall goal. For example, links made through wordplay such as a pun or clang association; or through some
vague idea which is not part of the original goal of
speech, e.g. ‘I need to go to bed now. Have you ever
smelt my bed of roses? Ah, but a rose by any other name
would smell just as sweet!’ Even though manic patients
may appear to be talking gibberish, a written transcript
of their speech will usually reveal that their ideas are related in some, albeit obscure, way.
As patients become increasingly manic, their associations tend to loosen as they find it increasingly difficult
to link their thoughts. Eventually they approach the incoherent thought disorder sometimes seen in schizophrenia (see Ch. 9).

Abnormal beliefs
Patients with elated mood will typically present with grandiose delusions in which they believe they have special importance or unusual powers. Persecutory delusions are also
common, especially in patients with an irritable mood,
and often feature them believing that others are trying
to take advantage of their exalted status. When the content
of delusions matches the mood of the patient, the delusions are termed mood-congruent. Very often, patients with
elevated mood may have overvalued ideas as opposed to

8

true delusions, which are important to distinguish, as the
former are not regarded as psychotic in nature (see p. 68).

Perceptual disturbance
Some hypomanic patients may describe subtle
distortions of perception. These are not psychotic
symptoms and mainly include altered intensity of
perception such that sounds seem louder (hyperacusis) or colours seem brighter and more vivid (visual
hyperaesthesia). Psychotic perceptual features develop when manic patients experience hallucinations.
This is usually in the form of voices encouraging or
exciting them.
HINTS AND TIPS
Always screen for psychotic symptoms in patients
suffering from a manic episode. The prevalence is very
high – two-thirds report experiencing psychotic
symptoms during such an episode. Interestingly only
one third report psychotic symptoms during a
depressive episode.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Like depression, an elevated or irritable mood can be
secondary to a medical condition, psychoactive substance use or other psychiatric disorder. These will
have to be excluded before a primary mood disorder
can be diagnosed. Figure 8.1 shows the differential
diagnosis for patients presenting with elevated or
irritable mood.

The patient with elevated or irritable mood

Mood (affective) disorders
Hypomanic, manic and mixed affective
episodes
The ICD-10 specifies three degrees of severity of a manic
episode: hypomania, mania without psychotic symptoms
and mania with psychotic symptoms. All of these share
the above-mentioned general characteristics, most notably: an elevated or irritable mood and an increase in
the quantity and speed of mental and physical activity.
Unlike for depressive episodes, the ICD-10 does not
specify a certain number of symptoms to establish the
diagnosis. It does, however, require the clinician to
determine the degree of psychosocial impairment, as
well as to code for the presence of psychotic symptoms
(Fig. 8.2 – note that the degree of impairment of social
functioning rather than number of symptoms is the crucial distinguishing factor between hypomania and mania). As mentioned previously, episodes where patients
present with rapidly alternating manic and depressive
symptoms are termed mixed affective episodes.

Bipolar affective disorder
Most patients who present with a hypomanic, manic or
mixed affective episode will have experienced a previous
episode of mood disturbance (depression, hypomania,

mania or mixed). In this case they should be diagnosed
with bipolar affective disorder. Most patients who experience hypomanic or manic episodes also experience depressive episodes, hence, the commonly used term:
‘manic-depression’. However, patients who only suffer
from manic or hypomanic episodes with no intervening
depressive episodes are also classified as having bipolar
affective disorder, even though their mood does not
swing to the depressive pole. It is good practice to record
the nature of the current episode in a patient with bipolar
affective disorder (e.g. ‘bipolar affective disorder, current
episode manic without psychotic features’).

Cyclothymia
Cyclothymia is analogous to dysthymia (see p. 52) in
that it usually begins in early adulthood and follows a
chronic course with intermittent periods of wellness
in between. It is characterized by an instability of mood
resulting in alternating periods of mild elation and mild
depression, none of which are sufficiently severe or long
enough to meet the criteria for either a hypomanic or a
depressive episode.

Depression
There are three common scenarios where a patient with
a primary depressive disorder may present with an

elevated or irritable mood. An ‘agitated depression’ can
present with a prominent irritable mood, which, when
coupled with psychomotor agitation, can be difficult to
distinguish from a manic episode. Secondly, depressed
patients who are responding to antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may experience a transient
period of elevated mood. Thirdly, a patient with a recently resolved depressive disorder might misidentify
euthymia for hypomania.

to a general medical

substance use
A medical or psychoactive substance cause of mania
should always be sought for and ruled out. Figure 8.3
lists the medical and substance-related causes of mania.
The medical condition or substance use should predate
the development of the mood disorder and symptoms
should resolve with treatment of the condition or
abstinence from the offending substance. Absence of
previous manic episodes or a family history of bipolar
affective disorder also supports this diagnosis.

Schizophreniform disorders
Schizoaffective disorder
See pages 52 and 73. This can be very difficult to distinguish from a manic episode with psychotic features.

Patients with schizophrenia can present with an excited,

Personality/neurodevelopmental
disorders
Patients with disorders of personality or neurodevelopment often report features similar to hypomania, e.g.
impulsivity, displays of temper and lability of mood
in borderline personality disorder or attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. However, personality and neurodevelopmental disorders involve stable and enduring
behaviour patterns, unlike the more discrete episodes
of bipolar affective disorder, which are characterized
by a distinct, demarcated deterioration in psychosocial
functioning.

Delirium/dementia
See Chapter 14.

The patient with elevated or irritable mood

Examination

ASSESSMENT

History

A basic physical examination, including a thorough neurological and endocrine system examination, should be
performed on all patients with elevated mood.

The following questions might be helpful in eliciting the
key symptoms of mania/hypomania:

Investigations

• Have you been feeling particularly happy or on top
of the world lately?
• Do you sometimes feel as though you have too
much energy compared to people around you?
• Do you find yourself needing less sleep but not
getting tired?
• Have you had any new interests or exciting ideas
lately?
• Have you noticed your thoughts racing in your
head?
• Do you have any special abilities or powers?

As for the depressive disorders (page 54), social, psychological and physical investigations are normally performed on manic patients mainly to establish the
diagnosis and to rule out an organic or substance-related
cause (see Fig. 8.3).

Discussion of case study

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mr EM appears to be suffering from a manic episode with
psychotic features. He has an elated mood and has developed the grandiose delusion that he is a world expert
(mood-congruent psychotic symptom); note also the
rapid switch to irritable mood when confronted. Biological symptoms include the reduced need for
sleep and increased mental and physical energy with
overactivity. Cognitive symptoms include elevated
sense of self-importance, poor concentration, accelerated thinking with pressure of speech and impaired
judgement and insight. The episode is classified as
manic because of the severe impairment in social

8

and probably work functioning, and because of the
psychotic features.
The past psychiatric history is extremely important in
this case. A previous mood episode (hypomanic, manic,
depressive, mixed) is required in order to make the
diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder. Mr EM had a period of depression 2 years prior to developing this manic
episode. If this was a genuine depressive episode, corroborated by a collateral history from Mr EM’s GP or
wife, then the diagnosis would be: bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic features. Previous
psychotic episodes should add schizoaffective disorder
and schizophrenia to the differential diagnosis.
Now go on to Chapter 18 to read about the mood
disorders and their management.

After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The definition of psychosis
• The definitions of: hallucination, pseudohallucination and illusion
• The definitions of: delusion, overvalued idea and obsession
• The phenomenology of psychosis
• The differential diagnosis of psychosis
• How to assess someone presenting with psychotic features

Case summary
Mr PP, aged 23 years, was assessed by his general
practitioner (GP) because his family had become
concerned about his behaviour. Over the last 6 months
his college attendance had been uncharacteristically
poor and he had terminated his part-time work.
He had also become increasingly reclusive, spending
more time alone in his flat, refusing to answer the
door or see his friends. After some inappropriate
suspiciousness, he allowed the GP into his flat and then
disclosed that government scientists had started to
perform experiments on him over the last year. These
involved the insertion of an electrode into his brain that
detected gamma rays transmitted from government
headquarters, which issued him with commands and
‘planted’ strange ideas in his head. When the GP asked
how he knew this, he replied that he heard the ‘men’s
voices’ as ‘clear as day’ and that they continually
commented on what he was thinking. He explained
that his suspicion that ‘all was not right’ was confirmed
when he heard the neighbour’s dog barking in the middle
of the night – at that point he knew ‘for certain’ that he
was being interfered with. Prompted by the GP, Mr PP
also mentioned that a man in his local pub knew of his
plight and had sent him a ‘covert signal’ when he
overheard the man conversing about the dangers of
nuclear experiments. He also admitted to ‘receiving
coded information’ from the radio whenever it was
turned on. The GP found no evidence of abnormal
mood, incoherence of speech or disturbed motor
function. Mr PP denied use of illicit drugs and appeared
physically well. After the GP discussed the case with a

psychiatrist, Mr PP was admitted to a psychiatric
hospital. He agreed to a voluntary admission, as he
was now afraid of staying alone at home.
(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

The psychotic patient can present in many varied ways.
It is often very difficult to elicit and describe specific
symptoms when a patient is speaking or behaving in
a grossly disorganized fashion. Therefore, it is important
to approach the psychotic patient in a logical and systematic fashion as well as to have a good understanding
of the psychopathology involved.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
Psychosis refers to a mental state in which reality is
grossly distorted, resulting in symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations and thought disorder. However,
patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders often have other symptoms too, e.g. psychomotor
abnormalities, mood/affect disturbance, cognitive deficits and disorganized behaviour.
There are many classifications that attempt to describe all the symptoms seen in schizophrenia and psychosis. So, in order to simplify matters it is useful to
approach psychotic psychopathology using five somewhat interrelated parameters:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Perception.
Abnormal beliefs.
Thought disorder.
Negative symptoms.
Psychomotor function.

Perceptual disturbance
Perception is the process of making sense of the physical
information we receive from our five sensory modalities.
Hallucinations are perceptions occurring in the absence of an external physical stimulus, which have the
following important characteristics:
• To the patient, the nature of a hallucination is exactly
the same as a normal sensory experience – i.e. it appears real. Therefore, patients often have little insight into their abnormal experience.
• They are experienced as external sensations from any
one of the five sensory modalities (hearing, vision,
smell, taste, touch) and should be distinguished
from ideas, thoughts, images or fantasies which originate in the patient’s own mind.
• They occur without an external stimulus and are not
merely distortions of an existing physical stimulus
(see illusions).
Illusions are misperceptions of real external stimuli, e.g.
in a dark room, a dressing gown hanging on a bedroom
wall is perceived as a person. Illusions often occur in
healthy people and are usually associated with inattention or strong emotion.
A pseudohallucination is a perceptual experience which
differs from a hallucination in that it appears to arise in
the subjective inner space of the mind, not through one
of the external sensory organs. Patients tend to describe
these sensations as being perceived with the ‘inner eye’
or ‘mind’s eye’ (or ear). Although experienced in internal

space they are not under conscious control. Examples
include: distressing flashbacks in post-traumatic stress
disorder or someone hearing a voice inside their own
head telling them to harm themselves. These are not
viewed as true psychotic experiences. Note that some
psychiatrists define pseudohallucinations to mean hallucinations that patients actually recognize as false perceptions, i.e. they have insight into the fact that they are
hallucinating. The former definition is probably more
widely used.
According to which sense organ they appear to arise
from, hallucinations are classified as auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory or somatic. Special forms of hallucinations will also be discussed. See Figure 9.1 for an outline
of the classification of hallucinations.

Auditory hallucinations
These are hallucinations of the hearing modality and are
the most common type of hallucinations in clinical
psychiatry. Elementary hallucinations are simple, unstructured sounds, e.g. whirring, buzzing, whistling or single
words; this type of hallucination commonly occurs in acute
organic states. Complex hallucinations occur as spoken
phrases, sentences or even dialogue that are classified as:
• Audible thoughts (first person): patients hear their own
thoughts spoken out loud as they think them. When
patients experience their thoughts as echoed by
a voice after they have thought them, it is termed
thought echo.

Definitions and clinical features
• Second person auditory hallucinations: patients hear a
voice or voices talking directly to them. Second person hallucinations can be persecutory, highly critical,
complimentary or issue commands to the patient
(command hallucinations). Second person hallucinations are often associated with mood disorders
with psychotic features and so will be critical or persecutory in a depressed patient or complimentary in a
manic patient, i.e. mood-congruent hallucinations.
• Third person auditory hallucinations: patients hear a
voice or voices speaking about them, referring to them
in the third person. This may take the form of two or
more voices arguing or discussing the patient among
themselves; or one or more voices giving a running
commentary on the patient’s thoughts or actions.

Visual hallucinations
These are hallucinations of the visual modality. They
occur most commonly in organic brain disturbances
(delirium, occipital lobe tumours, epilepsy, dementia)
and in the context of psychoactive substance use (lysergic
acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, petrol/glue-sniffing,
alcoholic hallucinosis). An autoscopic hallucination is
the experience of seeing an image of oneself in external
space. The Charles Bonnet syndrome describes the condition where patients experience complex visual hallucinations associated with no other psychiatric symptoms or
impairment in consciousness; it usually occurs in older
adults and is associated with loss of vision. Lilliputian
hallucinations are hallucinations of miniature people
or animals.

Somatic hallucinations
These are hallucinations of bodily sensation and include
superficial, visceral and kinaesthetic hallucinations.
Superficial hallucinations describe sensations on or
just below the skin and may be:
• Tactile (haptic): experience of the skin being touched,
pricked or pinched. Formication is the unpleasant
sensation of insects crawling on or just below the
skin; it is commonly associated with long-term cocaine use (cocaine bugs) and alcohol withdrawal.
• Thermal: false perception of heat or cold.
• Hygric: false perception of a fluid, e.g. ‘I can feel
water sloshing in my brain’.
• Visceral hallucinations describe false perceptions of
the internal organs. Patients may be distressed by
deep sensations of their organs throbbing, stretching, distending or vibrating.
• Kinaesthetic hallucinations are false perceptions of
joint or muscle sense. Patients may describe their
limbs vibrating or being twisted. The fleeting but distressing sensation of free falling just as one is about to
fall asleep is an example that most people have experienced (see hypnagogic hallucinations below).

9

Olfactory and gustatory hallucinations
These are the false perceptions of smell and taste. Note
that they commonly occur together because the two
senses are closely related. Remember that in patients
with olfactory or gustatory hallucinations, it is important to rule out epilepsy (especially of the temporal
lobe) and other organic brain diseases.

Special forms of hallucination
Hypnagogic hallucinations are false perceptions in any
modality (usually auditory or visual) that occur as a
person goes to sleep; whereas, hypnopompic hallucinations occur as a person awakens. These occur in normal
people and are not indicative of psychopathology.
Extracampine hallucinations are false perceptions that
occur outside the limits of a person’s normal sensory
field, e.g. a patient describes hearing voices from 100
miles away. Patients often give delusional explanations
for this phenomenon.
A functional hallucination occurs when a normal sensory stimulus is required to precipitate a hallucination
in that same sensory modality, e.g. voices that are only
heard when the doorbell rings. A reflex hallucination
occurs when a normal sensory stimulus in one modality
precipitates a hallucination in another, e.g. voices that
are only heard whenever the lights are switched on.

Abnormal beliefs
Abnormal beliefs include primary and secondary
delusions and overvalued ideas.

Delusions
A delusion is an unshakeable false belief that is not accepted by other members of the patient’s culture. It is
important to understand the following characteristics
of delusional thinking:
• To the patient, there is no difference between a delusional belief and a true belief – they are the same experience. Therefore, only an external observer can
diagnose a delusion. A delusion is to ideation what
an hallucination is to perception.
• The delusion is false because of faulty reasoning.
A man’s delusional belief that his wife is having an
affair may actually be true (she may indeed be
unfaithful), but it remains a delusion because the
reason he gives for this belief is undoubtedly false.
For example, she ‘must’ be having an affair because
she is part of a top-secret sexual conspiracy to prove
that he is a homosexual.
• It is out of keeping with the patient’s social and cultural background. It is crucial to establish that the belief is not one likely to be held by that person’s

67

The psychotic patient
subcultural group, e.g. a belief in the imminent
second coming of Christ may be appropriate for a
member of a religious group, but not for a formerly
atheist, middle-aged businessman.
It is diagnostically significant to classify delusions as:
•
•
•
•

Primary or secondary.
Mood congruent or mood incongruent.
Bizarre or non-bizarre.
According to the content of the delusion.

Primary delusions (autochthonous delusions) do not occur in response to any previous psychopathological state;
their genesis is un-understandable. They may be preceded
by a delusional atmosphere (mood) where patients have
a sense that the world around them has been subtly altered, often in a sinister or threatening way. In this state
a fully formed delusion has not yet developed and patients appear perplexed and apprehensive. Note that
when a delusion occurs after a delusional atmosphere it
is still regarded as primary – the delusional atmosphere
is probably a precursor to the fully developed primary delusion. A delusional perception is also a primary delusion
and occurs when a delusional meaning is attached to a
normal perception; e.g. a patient believed he was a terrorist target because he heard an aeroplane flying in the distance. Primary delusions occur typically in schizophrenia
and other primary psychotic disorders. Secondary delusions are the consequences of pre-existing psychopathological states, usually mood disorders (see p. 51 and
page 59). Many interrelated delusions that are centred
on a common theme are termed systematized delusions.
In mood-congruent delusions, the contents of the delusions are appropriate to the patient’s mood and are commonly seen in depression or mania with psychotic features.
Bizarre delusions are those which are completely
impossible; e.g. the belief that aliens have planted radioactive detonators in the patient’s brain. They are considered to be characteristic of schizophrenia.
Figure 9.2 lists the classification of delusions by their
content. It is important that you are able to label a
delusion according to its content, so take some time
to familiarize yourself with this table.
HINTS AND TIPS
Note that the term ‘paranoid’ refers to any delusions or
ideas that are unduly self-referent –typically delusions or
ideas of persecution, grandeur or reference. It should
not be used synonymously with the term persecutory;
i.e. when a patient has a false belief that people are
trying to harm him, do not say that he is paranoid, rather
say that he has persecutory delusions.

Finally, beliefs that were previously held with delusional intensity but then become held with less

68

conviction are termed partial delusions. This occurs
when patients start recovering after receiving treatment.
COMMUNICATION
Direct questioning about perceptual experience may
alienate a non-psychotic patient and raise undue
suspicion in a psychotic patient. To maintain rapport
with patients begin these questions with a primer such
as: ‘I am now going to ask you some questions which
may seem a little strange, but are routine questions
which I ask all patients’.

Overvalued ideas
An overvalued idea is a plausible belief that a patient becomes preoccupied with to an unreasonable extent. The
key feature is that the pursuit of this idea causes considerable distress to the patient or those living around
them – it is overvalued. Patients who hold overvalued
ideas have usually had them for many years and typically have abnormalities of personality. They are distinguished from delusions by the lack of a gross
abnormality in reasoning; these patients can often give
fairly logical reasons for their beliefs. They differ from
obsessions in that they are not seen as recurrent intrusions. However, one will frequently encounter beliefs
that span definitions. Typical disorders that feature
overvalued ideas are anorexia nervosa, hypochondriacal
disorder, dysmorphophobia, paranoid personality disorder and morbid jealousy (this can also take the form
of a delusion).

Thought disorder
Describing the disturbance of a patient’s thought form is
one of the most challenging tasks facing clinicians. This
problem is compounded by two factors. Firstly, it is impossible to know what patients are actually thinking –
thought form has to be inferred from their speech and
behaviour. Secondly, the unfortunate situation has
arisen where various authors in psychiatry have described a different conceptual view of thought disorder,
which has resulted in conflicting and confusing classification systems. It is probably not that important that
you are able to classify and subgroup thought disorder,
but rather that you have a clear understanding of the individual definitions you intend to use and are able to
recognize them in the patients that you assess. In this
regard, it is particularly helpful if you document and
are able to cite examples of the patient’s speech in their
own words.
Many patients with delusions are able to communicate in a clear and coherent manner; although their beliefs may be false, their speech is organized. However,

Definitions and clinical features
Fig. 9.2 Classification of delusions by content

Classification

Content

Persecutory delusions

False belief that one is being harmed, threatened, cheated, harassed or is a
victim of a conspiracy

Grandiose delusions

False belief that one is exceptionally powerful (including having ‘mystical
powers’), talented or important

Delusions of reference

False belief that certain objects, people or events have intense personal
significance and refer specifically to oneself, e.g. believing that a television
newsreader is talking directly about one

Religious delusions

False belief pertaining to a religious theme, often grandiose in nature, e.g.
believing that one is a special messenger from God

Delusions of love (erotomania)

False belief that another person is in love with one (commoner in women).
In one form, termed de Clérambault syndrome, a woman (usually) believes
that a man, frequently older and of higher status, is in love with her

Delusion of infidelity (morbid
jealousy, Othello syndrome)

False belief that one’s lover has been unfaithful. Note that morbid jealousy
may also take the form of an overvalued idea, that is, non-psychotic jealousy

Delusions of misidentification

Capgras syndrome: belief that a familiar person has been replaced by an exact
double – an impostor
Fregoli syndrome: belief that a complete stranger is actually a familiar person
already known to one

Nihilistic delusions (see Cotard’s
syndrome, p. 182)

False belief that oneself, others or the world is non-existent or about to end. In
severe cases, negation is carried to the extreme with patients claiming that
nothing, including themselves, exists

Somatic delusions

False belief concerning one’s body and its functioning, e.g. that one’s
bowels are rotting. Also called hypochondriacal delusions (to be distinguished
from the overvalued ideas seen in hypochondriacal disorder)

Delusions of infestation (Ekbom’s
syndrome)

False belief that one is infested with small but visible organisms. May also occur
secondary to tactile hallucinations, e.g. formication (see text)

Delusions of control (passivity or
‘made’ experiences)
Note: these are all first-rank
symptoms of schizophrenia

False belief that one’s thoughts, feelings, actions or impulses are controlled or
‘made’ by an external agency, e.g. believing that one was made to break a
window by demons
Delusions of thought control include:
Thought insertion: belief that thoughts or ideas are being implanted in one’s
head by an external agency
Thought withdrawal: belief that one’s thoughts or ideas are being extracted
from one’s head by an external agency
Thought broadcasting: belief that one’s thoughts are being diffused or
broadcast to others such that they know what one is thinking

there is a subgroup of psychotic patients who speak in
such a disorganized way that it becomes difficult to understand what they are saying. The coherency of patients
with disorganized thinking varies from being mostly
understandable in patients exhibiting circumstantial
thinking to being completely incomprehensible in patients with a word salad phenomenon (see Fig. 9.3).
The following are important signs of disorganized
thinking:

Circumstantial and tangential thinking
See page 59.

Flight of ideas
See page 59.

Loosening of association (derailment/
knight’s move thinking)
This is when the patient’s train of thought shifts suddenly from one very loosely or unrelated idea to the
next. In its worst form, speech becomes a mixture of incoherent words and phrases and is termed ‘word salad’.
Loosening of association is characteristic of schizophrenia. Note that some psychiatrists, but unfortunately not

all, use the term formal thought disorder synonymously
with loosening of association.

Thought blocking
This occurs when patients experience a sudden cessation
to their flow of thought, often in mid-sentence (observed as sudden breaks in speech). Patients have no recall of what they were saying or thinking and thus
continue talking about a different topic.

Neologisms and idiosyncratic word use
Neologisms are new words created by the patient, often
combining syllables of other known words. Patients can
also use recognized words idiosyncratically by attributing them with a non-recognized meaning (metonyms).

Perseveration
This is when an initially correct response is inappropriately repeated, for example, unnecessarily repeating a
previously expressed word or phrase. Palilalia describes

70

the repetition of the last word of a sentence; logoclonia
describes the repetition of the last syllable of the last
word. Perseveration is highly suggestive of organic brain
disease.

Echolalia
This is when patients senselessly repeat words or phrases
spoken around them by others – like a parrot.

Irrelevant answers
Patients give answers that are completely unrelated to
the original question.

Negative symptoms
Positive symptoms are those that are actively produced
and include delusions, hallucinations, loosening of association and bizarre speech or behaviour. This is opposed to negative symptoms that indicate a clinical
deficit and include marked apathy, poverty of thought
and speech, blunting of affect, social isolation, poor

9

Differential diagnosis
self-care and cognitive deficits. Patients can have positive and negative symptoms simultaneously or, as often
happens, develop a negative presentation after initially
presenting with predominantly positive symptoms. Remember that patients with a depressed mood or those
experiencing significant side-effects from psychotropic
medication may also present with negative symptoms.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Psychotic symptoms are non-specific and are associated
with many primary psychiatric illnesses. They can also
present secondary to a general medical condition or psychoactive substance use. See Figure 9.5 for the differential diagnosis for the psychotic patient.

Psychomotor function
Although a relatively rare phenomenon in industrialized
countries, some psychotic patients will present with
abnormalities of motor function. Motor system dysfunction in schizophrenia is usually due to the extrapyramidal side-effects of neuroleptic medication (see Ch. 2).
However, psychotic patients can occasionally present
with impressive motor signs that are not caused by
psychiatric medication or a known organic brain disease.
Although undoubtedly associated with the patient’s abnormal mental state, the cause of this psychomotor dysfunction is far from clarified. The term ‘catatonia’ literally
means extreme muscular tone or rigidity; however, it
commonly describes any excessive or decreased motor
activity that is apparently purposeless and includes abnormalities of movement, tone or position. Note that
catatonic symptoms are not diagnostic of schizophrenia;
they may also be caused by brain diseases, metabolic abnormalities or psychoactive substances, and can also occur in mood disorders. Figure 9.4 describes the common
motor symptoms seen in schizophrenia.

Psychotic disorders
Schizophrenia
There are no pathognomonic or singularly defining
symptoms of schizophrenia; it is a syndrome characterized by a heterogeneous cluster of symptoms and signs.
The ICD-10 has set out diagnostic guidelines based on
the most commonly occurring symptom groups, which
have been discussed in the preceding section (Fig. 9.6).
It is also important to establish that there has been a
clear and marked deterioration in the patient’s social
and work functioning.
In the past, psychiatrists used Schneider’s first-rank
symptoms to make the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Kurt
Schneider suggested that the presence of one or more
first-rank symptoms in the absence of organic disease
was of pragmatic value in making the diagnosis of
schizophrenia. First-rank symptoms are still referred
to so you should familiarize yourself with them; they
are presented in Figure 9.7.

Fig. 9.4 Motor symptoms in schizophrenia

Catatonic rigidity

Maintaining a fixed position and rigidly resisting all attempts to be moved

Catatonic posturing

Adopting an unusual or bizarre position that is then maintained for some time

Catatonic negativism

A seemingly motiveless resistance to all instructions or attempts to be moved; patients
may do the opposite of what is asked

Catatonic waxy flexibility
(flexibilitas cerea)

Patients can be ‘moulded’ like wax into a position that is then maintained

Catatonic excitement

Agitated, excited and seemingly purposeless motor activity, not influenced by
external stimuli

Catatonic stupor

A presentation of akinesis (lack of voluntary movement), mutism and extreme
unresponsiveness in an otherwise alert patient (there may be slight clouding of
consciousness)

Echopraxia

Patients senselessly repeat or imitate the actions of those around them. Associated
with echolalia (see text) – also occurs in patients with frontal lobe damage

Mannerisms

Apparently goal-directed movements (e.g. waving, saluting) that are performed
repeatedly or at socially inappropriate times

Stereotypies

A complex movement that does not appear to be goal-directed (e.g. rocking to and
fro, gyrating)

Tics

Sudden, involuntary, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic motor movements or
vocalizations

HINTS AND TIPS
Memory aid: if you add ‘bizarre delusions’ and
‘hallucinations coming from a part of the body’ to
Schneider’s first-rank symptoms you will have the (a) to
(d) criteria of the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines for
schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia subtypes
Due to the differing presentations of schizophrenia, researchers have tried to identify schizophrenia subtypes.
The importance of these subtypes is that they vary in
their prognosis and treatment response. The ICD-10
has coded the following subtypes, which are not necessarily exclusive:
• Paranoid schizophrenia: dominated by the presence of
delusions and hallucinations (positive symptoms).
Negative and catatonic symptoms as well as thought
disorganization are not prominent. The prognosis is
usually better and the onset of illness later than the
other subtypes.
• Hebephrenic (disorganized) schizophrenia: characterized by thought disorganization, disturbed
behaviour and inappropriate or flat affect. Delusions and hallucination are fleeting or not prominent. Onset of illness is earlier (15 to 25 years
of age) and the prognosis poorer than paranoid
schizophrenia.
• Catatonic schizophrenia: a rare form characterized by
one or more catatonic symptoms (see Fig. 9.4).
• Residual schizophrenia: 1 year of predominantly
chronic negative symptoms which must have been
preceded by at least one clear cut psychotic episode
in the past.

72

Fig. 9.6 ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines for schizophrenia

One or more of the following symptoms:
a. Thought echo, insertion, withdrawal or broadcast
b. Delusions of control or passivity; delusional
perception
c. Hallucinatory voices giving a running commentary;
discussing the patient among themselves or ‘originating’ from some part of the body
d. Bizarre delusions
OR
Two or more of the following symptoms:
e. Other hallucinations that either occur every
day for weeks or that are associated with
fleeting delusions or sustained overvalued
ideas
f. Thought disorganization (loosening of association,
incoherence, neologisms)
g. Catatonic symptoms
h. Negative symptoms
i. Change in personal behaviour (loss of interest,
aimlessness, social withdrawal)
Symptoms should be present for most of the time
during at least 1 month
Schizophrenia should not be diagnosed in the
presence of organic brain disease or during drug
intoxication or withdrawal

Schizophrenia-like psychotic disorders
Some psychotic episodes with schizophrenia-like
symptoms seem to have an abrupt onset (without a
prodromal phase), to be precipitated by an acute
life stress or to have a duration of symptoms less than
that usually observed in schizophrenia. The ICD-10
codes these as acute and transient psychotic disorders.
The DSM-IV, on the other hand, suggests diagnoses
of schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder. Often these diagnoses are superseded by a later
diagnosis of schizophrenia as the clinical picture
evolves.

Fig. 9.7 Schneider’s first-rank symptoms of
schizophrenia

• Delusional perception
• Delusions of thought control: insertion, withdrawal,
broadcast

• Delusions of control: passivity experiences of
affect (feelings), impulse, volition and somatic
passivity (influence controlling the body)
• Hallucinations: audible thoughts (first person
or thought echo), voices arguing or
discussing the patient, voices giving a running
commentary

9

Differential diagnosis

Schizoaffective disorder
Schizoaffective disorder describes the presentation of
both schizophrenic and mood (depressed or manic)
symptoms that present in the same episode of illness,
either simultaneously or within a few days of each
other. The mood symptoms should meet the criteria
for either a depressive or manic episode. Patients should
also have at least one, preferably two, of the typical
schizophrenic symptoms – symptoms (a) to (d) as specified in the ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnostic guidelines
(see Fig. 9.6). Depending on the particular mood
symptoms displayed, this disorder can be coded in
the ICD-10 as schizoaffective disorder, manic type or
schizoaffective disorder, depressed type.

Psychotic episodes secondary
to a general medical
condition or psychoactive
substance use
A medical or psychoactive substance cause of psychosis
should always be sought for and ruled out. Figure 9.8
lists the medical and substance-related causes of psychotic episodes. The medical condition or substance
use should predate the development of the psychosis
and symptoms should resolve with treatment of the
condition or abstinence from the offending substance.
Absence of previous psychotic episodes and absence
of a family history of schizophrenia also supports this
diagnosis.

HINTS AND TIPS
When psychiatrists talk about the typical symptoms
of schizophrenia, they are generally referring to (a) to
(d) of the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia (or
Schneider’s first-rank symptoms), e.g. delusions of
control, running commentary hallucinations, etc.

Delusional disorder
In this disorder, the development of a single or set of delusions for the period of at least 3 months is the most
prominent or only symptom. It usually has its onset in
middle age and expressed delusions may persist throughout the patient’s life and include persecutory, grandiose
and hypochondriacal delusions. Typically schizophrenic
delusions, such as delusions of thought control or passivity, exclude this diagnosis. Hallucinations, if present,
tend to be only fleeting and are not typically schizophrenic in nature; brief depressive symptoms may also
be evident. Affect, speech and behaviour are all normal
and these patients usually have well-preserved personal
and social skills. Rarely, patients may present with an induced delusional disorder (folie à deux), which occurs
when a non-psychotic patient with close emotional ties
to another person suffering from delusions (usually a
dominant figure) begins to share those delusional ideas
themselves. The delusions in the non-psychotic patient
tend to resolve when the two are separated.

Mood (affective) disorders
Manic episode with psychotic features
See Chapter 8.

Depressive episode, severe with psychotic
features
See Chapter 7.

Delirium and dementia
Visual hallucinations and delusions are common in delirium and may also occur in dementia, particularly diffuse Lewy body dementia (see Ch. 14).

Personality disorder
In general, schizophrenia presents with a clear change
in behaviour and functioning, sometimes with a prodrome, whereas patients with a personality or neurodevelopmental disorder have never achieved a normal
baseline. Schizotypal (personality) disorder is characterized by eccentric behaviour and peculiarities of thinking
and appearance. Although there are no clear psychotic

symptoms evident and its course resembles that of a personality disorder, the ICD-10 actually describes schizotypal disorder in the chapter on psychotic disorders.
This is because it is more prevalent among relatives of
patients with schizophrenia and, occasionally, it progresses to overt schizophrenia. Borderline, paranoid
and schizoid personality disorders also share similar
features to schizophrenia without displaying clear-cut
psychotic symptoms. Personality disorders are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 16.

Neurodevelopmental disorder
Social difficulties and rigid thinking are found in both
autistic spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. See
Chapter 27.

ALGORITHM FOR THE DIAGNOSIS
OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS

ASSESSMENT

History
The following questions may be helpful in eliciting psychotic phenomena on mental state examination:

Hallucinations
• Do you ever hear strange noises or voices when there
is no one else about?
• Do you ever hear your own thoughts spoken aloud
such that someone standing next to you might possibly hear them? (audible thoughts – first person
auditory hallucinations)
• Do you ever hear your thoughts echoed just after you
have thought them? (thought echo)
• Do these voices talk directly to you or give you commands? (second person auditory hallucinations)
• Do these voices ever talk about you with each other or
make comments about what you are doing? (third person auditory hallucinations/running commentary)

Discussion of case study

Delusions
• Are you afraid that someone is trying to harm or poison you? (persecutory delusions)
• Have you noticed that people are doing or saying
things that have a special meaning for you? (delusions of reference)
• Do you have any special abilities or powers? (grandiose delusions)
• Does it seem as though you are being controlled or
influenced by some external force? (delusions of
control)
• Are thoughts that don’t belong to you being put into
your head? (thought insertion)
It is important to obtain collateral information from the
patient’s GP, family and care coordinator (if they have
one) to establish premorbid personality and functioning as well as pattern of deterioration.

Examination
A basic physical examination including a thorough neurological and endocrine system examination should be
performed on all patients with psychotic symptoms.

Investigations
• Blood investigations are performed to:
• Exclude possible medical or substance-related
causes of psychosis
• Establish baseline values before administering
antipsychotics and other psychotropic drugs that
may alter blood composition
• Assess renal and liver functioning which may
affect elimination of drugs that are likely to be
taken long-term and possibly in depot form.
• If the patient presents with a first episode of psychosis, a good basic screen comprises full blood count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea and electrolytes, thyroid function, liver function tests, glucose,
serum calcium, and a syphilis serology test if syphilis
is suspected.
• A urine drug screen should always be done because
illicit drugs both cause and exacerbate a psychosis.
• An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be done in patients with cardiac problems as many antipsychotics

9

prolong the QT interval and have the potential to
cause lethal ventricular arrhythmia.
• The use of a routine EEG or CT scan to help exclude
an organic psychosis (e.g. temporal lobe epilepsy,
brain tumour) varies between psychiatric units; they
should always be considered in atypical cases, cases
with treatment resistance, or if there are cognitive or
neurological abnormalities.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mr PP meets the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia, paranoid subtype. He has had a marked deterioration in his
social and work functioning. He has delusions of persecution (believing he was a victim of government experiments), thought control (believing that ideas were
being planted in his head (thought insertion)) and reference (believing that the man in pub was referring specifically to him). His claim that he knew these things
after hearing the neighbour’s dog bark suggests delusional perception. He also has second person command
hallucinations and third person, running commentary
hallucinations. ‘Receiving coded information’ from
the radio might be a hallucination or a delusion of reference depending on how Mr PP described this experience subjectively. Mr PP’s description that ‘all was not
right’ could indicate the presence of a delusional atmosphere, prior to the development of the full-blown
delusions.
It is imperative that a substance-induced psychotic
disorder or psychotic disorder secondary to a medical
condition is excluded. It would be important to ascertain the duration of Mr PP’s psychotic symptoms. It
seems as though he has had schizophrenic symptoms
for over a month. If the duration of symptoms had been
less than a month, it would be advisable to diagnose a
schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder, e.g. acute and
transient psychotic disorder. It is important to rule
out a mood disorder with psychotic features. The presence of a mood episode associated with simultaneous
schizophrenic symptoms would suggest a schizoaffective episode. Prominent hallucinations militate against
a diagnosis of delusional disorder.
Now go on to Chapter 19 to read more about the psychotic disorders and their management.

Case summary
Mrs PA, a 32-year-old divorced interior designer, was
referred to a consultant psychiatrist by her family doctor
because of a 6-month history of sudden, dramatic
anxiety attacks accompanied by heart palpitations,
profuse sweating, dizziness, a choking sensation and a
fear that she was going to die. There appeared to be no
logical reason for the attacks and Mrs PA described them
as coming on ‘out of the blue’. They reached their
maximum intensity within 2 minutes and seldom lasted
longer than 15 minutes, occurring two to three times a
week. Because of these attacks, which occurred in any
situation and at any time of day, Mrs PA had stopped
going into shops or crowded public places for fear of
having an attack and not being able to escape to a safe
place and appearing like a ‘blubbering fool’. She had
started relying on her mother to accompany her on
‘absolutely necessary’ household excursions ‘just in case’
she had another attack. Her GP had booked her off work
for the past 3 months, as she was too frightened to visit
potential clients’ houses in the event that she had
another attack. Mrs PA told the psychiatrist that she had
almost become housebound and felt that she was ‘losing
her mind’. A full physical examination, routine blood
tests including: full blood count, urea and electrolytes,
fasting glucose, liver function, thyroid function and
calcium concentration as well as an electrocardiogram
(ECG) revealed no abnormalities.

Feelings of anxiety or fear are both common and essential
to the human experience. It is the very uncomfortable nature of this experience that makes anxiety such an effective
alerting, and therefore harm-avoiding, device. However,
for the same reasons, when anxiety is excessive and
unchecked it can create an extremely debilitating condition. To distinguish between normal and psychopathological anxiety it is important to observe the patient’s
level of functioning. The Yerkes–Dodson law states that
the relationship between performance and anxiety has
the shape of an inverted U: mild to moderate levels of
anxiety improve performance, but high levels impair it.
Figure 10.1 demonstrates the Yerkes–Dodson curve.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
Both anxiety and fear are alerting signals that occur in
response to a potential threat. Some authors suggest that
anxiety occurs in response to threat that is unknown, internal or vague (i.e. objectless); whereas fear occurs in
response to a threat from a known, external or definite
object.
The experience of anxiety consists of two interrelated
components: (1) thoughts of being apprehensive, nervous or frightened and (2) the awareness of a physical reaction to anxiety (autonomic or peripheral anxiety).
Figure 10.2 summarizes the physical signs of anxiety.
The experience of anxiety may lead to a change in behaviour, particularly an avoidance of the real or imagined
threat.
There are two patterns of pathological anxiety:
1. Generalized (free-floating) anxiety does not occur in
discrete episodes and tends to last for hours, days or

even longer and is of mild to moderate severity. It is
not associated with a specific external threat or
situation (i.e. free-floating) but is rather excessive
worry or apprehension about many normal
life events (e.g. job security, relationships and
responsibilities).
2. Paroxysmal anxiety has an abrupt onset, occurs in
discrete episodes and tends to be quite severe. In
its severest form, paroxysmal anxiety presents as
panic attacks. These are discrete episodes of
short-lived (usually less than 1 hour), intense anxiety. They have an abrupt onset and rapidly build
up to a peak level of anxiety. They are accompanied
by strong autonomic symptoms (see Fig. 10.2),
which may lead patients to believe that they are dying, having a heart attack or going mad. This increases their anxiety level and produces further
physical symptoms, thereby creating a vicious
cycle.

78

See Figure 10.3 for a comparison of panic attacks and
free-floating (generalized) anxiety. Quite often the
two co-occur: someone with a background moderately
elevated anxiety level can also have superimposed panic
attacks.
Paroxysmal anxiety can further be subdivided into
episodes of anxiety that occur seemingly spontaneously, without a specific imagined or external threat
(see panic disorder, later) and those episodes that occur in response to a specific imagined or external
threat. The phobic disorders are the most common
cause of paroxysmal anxiety in response to a perceived
threat.
A phobia is an intense, irrational fear of an object,
activity or situation (e.g. flying, heights, animals,
blood, public speaking). Although they may recognize that their fear is irrational, patients characteristically avoid the phobic stimulus or endure it
with extreme distress. It is the degree of fear that is
irrational in that the feared objects or situations
are not inevitably dangerous and do not cause such
severe anxiety in most other people. In severe
cases, phobic anxiety may progress to frank panic
attacks.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
When considering the differential diagnosis of anxiety
you should determine:
• The rate of onset, severity and duration of the anxiety, i.e. is the anxiety generalized or paroxysmal?
• Whether the anxiety is in response to a specific threat
or arises spontaneously (unprovoked).
• Whether the anxiety only occurs in the context of a
pre-existing psychiatric or medical condition.
Figure 10.4 presents the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with anxiety and Figure 10.5 gives a
diagnostic algorithm.

Anxiety disorders
It is useful to consider the primary anxiety disorders
under the headings: phobic disorders, non-situational
disorders, reaction to stress and obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

Phobic disorders
Remember that:
• Phobic disorders are associated with a prominent
avoidance of the feared situation.
• The situationally induced anxiety may be so severe as
to take the form of a panic attack.

Fig. 10.4 Differential diagnosis for patients presenting
with anxiety

Anxiety disorders:
• Phobic disorders
• Agoraphobia (with or without panic disorder)
• Social phobia
• Specific phobia
• Non-situational disorders
• Generalized anxiety disorder
• Panic disorder
• Reaction to stress
• Acute stress reaction
• Post-traumatic stress disorder
• Adjustment disorder
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder
• Secondary to other psychiatric disorders (especially
depression and psychosis)
• Secondary to a general medical condition
• Secondary to psychoactive substance use
(especially alcohol use)

Agoraphobia
Agoraphobia literally means ‘fear of the marketplace’, i.e.
fear of public places. In psychiatry today, it has a wider
meaning that also includes a fear of entering crowded
spaces (shops,trains, buses, elevators) where an immediate
escape is difficult or in which help might not be available in
the event of having a panic attack. At the worst extreme, patients may become housebound or refuse to leave the
house unless accompanied by a close friend or relative.
There is a close relationship between agoraphobia
and panic disorder that occurs when patients develop
a fear of being in a place from where escape would be
difficult in the event of having a panic attack. In fact,
studies have shown that in a clinical setting, up to
95% of patients presenting with agoraphobia have a
current or past diagnosis of panic disorder. Therefore,

in the ICD-10 you can code agoraphobia as occurring
with or without panic disorder.

Social phobia
Patients with social phobia fear social situations where
they might be exposed to scrutiny by others that might
lead to humiliation or embarrassment. This fear might
be limited to an isolated fear (e.g. public speaking, eating in public, fear of vomiting, or interacting with the
opposite sex) or may involve almost all social activities
outside the home.

Specific phobia
Specific (simple) phobias are restricted to clearly specific and discernible objects or situations (other than
those covered in agoraphobia and social phobia). Examples from adult psychiatric samples in order of decreasing prevalence include:
• Situational: specific situations, e.g. public transportation, flying, driving, tunnels, bridges, elevators.
• Natural environment: heights, storms, water,
darkness.
• Blood–injection–injury: seeing blood or an injury,
fear of needles or an invasive medical procedure.
• Animal: animals or insects, e.g. spiders, dogs, mice.
• Other: fear of choking or vomiting, contracting an illness (e.g. HIV), children’s fear of costumed characters.
HINTS AND TIPS
Even if a patient appears calm and denies troublesome
anxiety symptoms, always screen for phobias. This is
because sufferers of phobic disorders avoid their phobic
stimulus. If this is the case, it is also important to establish
how severely their lives are curtailed by avoidance.

Fig. 10.5 Diagnostic algorithm for anxiety and stress related disorders

Non-situational anxiety disorders
These disorders, unlike the phobic disorders, are characterized by primary anxiety symptoms that are not
restricted to any specific situation or circum-stance.

Generalized anxiety disorder
The key element of generalized anxiety disorder is
long-standing, free-floating anxiety. Patients describe
excessive worry about minor matters and should
be apprehensive on most days for about 6 months.
The ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines suggest three key
elements:

80

1. Apprehension.
2. Motor tension (restlessness, fidgeting, tension headaches, inability to relax).
3. Autonomic overactivity (see Fig. 10.2).

HINTS AND TIPS
Blood–injection–injury phobias differ from others in
that they are characterized by bradycardia and
possibly syncope (vasovagal response), rather than
tachycardia.

Differential diagnosis
Panic disorder
Panic disorder is characterized by the presence of panic
attacks that occur unpredictably and are not restricted to
any particular situation (phobic disorders) or objective
danger. Panic attacks are so distressing that patients
commonly develop a fear of having further attacks; this
is known as anticipatory anxiety. Anticipatory anxiety
apart, patients are relatively free from anxiety symptoms
between attacks.
Remember that many patients with panic disorder
will also have concurrent agoraphobia, so in the
ICD-10 you can code agoraphobia as occurring with
or without panic disorder.
COMMUNICATION
When asking a patient whether they suffer from
panic attacks, always define panic attacks for them
(i.e. short, discrete episodes of extremely severe
anxiety). This is because patients commonly use the
term to describe non-specific anxiety.

Reaction to stress and obsessivecompulsive disorder
The disorders associated with a reaction to stress and
obsessive-compulsive disorder are discussed in Chapters 12 and 11 respectively.
HINTS AND TIPS
Both agoraphobia and severe social phobia may result
in patients becoming housebound and the two
disorders can be difficult to distinguish. When in doubt,
precedence should be given to agoraphobia.

10

Other psychiatric conditions
Anxiety is a non-specific symptom and can occur secondary to other psychiatric conditions. See Figure 10.6 for examples of psychiatric problems commonly associated
with anxiety.
Note that depression and anxiety are closely intertwined. Not only can anxiety occur secondary to a depressive disorder and vice versa, but some authors
have also suggested that the two disorders are aetiologically related. About 65% of patients with anxiety
also have depressive symptoms; therefore, when making a diagnosis, it is essential to decide which symptoms
came first or were predominant and which were secondary. If symptoms of anxiety occur only in the context of a
genuine depressive episode then depression takes precedence and should be diagnosed alone.

Anxiety secondary to a general
medical condition or psychoactive
substance use
A medical or psychoactive substance cause of anxiety
should always be actively sought and ruled out.
Figure 10.7 lists the medical and substance-related
causes of anxiety. The medical condition or substance
use should predate the development of the anxiety
and symptoms should resolve with treatment of the
condition or abstinence from the offending substance.
Absence of previous anxiety or absence of a family history of anxiety disorder also supports this diagnosis. Often symptoms can arise from a combination of a general
medical condition and anxiety, as each predispose to
the other. For example, if someone is having an acute
asthma attack they will naturally feel anxious and
breathe even faster. Helping them to calm down may
be an important intervention.

ASSESSMENT

History
The following questions may be helpful in eliciting anxiety symptoms:
• Do you sometimes wake up feeling anxious and
dreading the day ahead? (any form of anxiety)
• Do you worry excessively about minor matters on
most days of the week? (generalized anxiety)
• Have you ever been so frightened that your heart was
pounding and you thought you might die? (panic
attack)
• Do you avoid leaving the house alone because you
are afraid of having a panic attack or being in situations (like being in a crowded shop or on a train)
from which escape will be difficult or embarrassing?
(agoraphobia)
• Do you get anxious in social situations, like speaking
in front of people or making conversation? (social
phobia)
• Do some things or situations make you very scared?
Do you avoid them? (specific phobia)

Examination
A basic physical examination, including a thorough
neurological and endocrine system examination,
should be performed on all patients with symptoms
of anxiety.

82

Investigations
The anxiety disorders can only be diagnosed when the
symptoms are not due to the direct effect of a substance
or medical condition. This stipulation is particularly
relevant when considering diagnoses of generalized
anxiety disorder and panic disorder. It is impractical to
test for each of the large number of drugs and organic
conditions capable of producing anxiety symptoms (seeFig. 10.7). It is, however, important to exclude any disease or substance that may be implicated through any
clues in the history (e.g. past medical history and drug
history) and physical examination. For example, a patient with a rapid pulse and heat intolerance should have
thyroid function tests in case thyrotoxicosis is causing the
anxiety symptoms. The possibility of withdrawal syndromes (e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates) causing
anxiety symptoms should also be considered.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Repeated, unexpected episodes of short-lived intense
anxiety of abrupt onset and rapidly building up to a
peak level of anxiety associated with palpitations, sweating, dizziness, a choking sensation and thoughts of
being about to die, with no medical cause, suggests a
diagnosis of panic disorder.
As is common in many patients with panic disorder,
agoraphobia has developed as a super-added problem
as evidenced by a fear of going into situations from

Discussion of case study
which escape might be difficult or humiliating. Mrs PA
is showing the important sign of avoidance of the feared
situation by refusing to go out unless it is essential and
then only accompanied by her mother. Note that fear of
having another panic attack indicates anticipatory anxiety; fear of having a panic attack in a situation from
which escape will be difficult or humiliating, thus

10

resulting in avoidance of those situations indicates agoraphobia – Mrs PA has both.
It is important to rule out depression or other psychiatric conditions as well as medical conditions and
psychoactive substance use.
Now go on to Chapter 20 to read about the anxiety
disorders and their management.

Case summary
Mr OC is a 22-year-old medical student and has
recently moved into his own flat. He describes a
5-month history of recurrent thoughts that he has
behaved in a sexually inappropriate way towards his
mother. He says that even though on one level he
knows that this is impossible, he is unable to push
these thoughts away despite trying ‘rigorous mental
gymnastics’. The only way he is able to relieve the
distress he experiences is to actually contact his
mother for reassurance that his fears are not true.
On most days, he physically has to go and see his
mother, and will spend up to 2 hours analysing his
behaviour with her until he feels reassured. Whenever
he tries to stop himself from seeking reassurance, he
feels a rapid escalation in anxiety, thinking that not
contacting his mother is evidence that his thoughts
‘might be true’. He shudders in horror when asked
whether he has ever had any sexual feelings for his
mother but admits that these distressing thoughts are
‘obviously’ his own. He is heterosexual and has recently
become engaged. He is extremely embarrassed and
was eventually persuaded to see his general
practitioner (GP) by his mother and fiancée when he
started falling behind with his studies. He says that
the whole thing is starting to depress him and that
he has lost weight.

use these terms in a very specific way and it is important
to elicit, recognize and understand obsessive-compulsive
psychopathology.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES

Obsessions and compulsions
Obsessions are involuntary thoughts, images or
impulses which have the following important characteristics:
• They are recurrent and intrusive, and are experienced
as unpleasant or distressing.
• They enter the mind against conscious resistance. Patients try to resist but are unable to do so.
• Patients recognize obsessions as being the product of
their own mind (not from without as in thought
insertion (see p. 69 and Fig. 11.4)) even though they
are involuntary and often repugnant.
Obsessions are not merely excessive concerns about
normal life problems, and patients generally retain insight into the fact that their thoughts are irrational. In
fact, patients often see their obsessions as foreign to,
or against, their ‘essence’ (ego-dystonic or ego-alien),
e.g. a religious man has recurrent thoughts that he has
betrayed God (also, see case study).

COMMUNICATION
(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

Obsessions or compulsions are terms that are often used
in everyday language, e.g. ‘she has an obsession with
shoes’ or ‘he is a compulsive liar’. Psychiatrists, however,

© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00011-4

When asking a patient if they are suffering from
obsessional thinking, always define ‘obsession’.
This is because, like many psychiatric terms, ‘obsession’
has other, less specific meanings.

85

The patient with obsessions and compulsions
Compulsions are repetitive mental operations (counting, praying or repeating a mantra silently) or physical
acts (checking, seeking reassurance, handwashing, strict
rituals) that have the following unique characteristics:
• Patients feel compelled to perform them in response
to their own obsessions (see case study) or irrationally defined ‘rules’ (e.g. ‘I must count to 10 000 four
times before falling asleep’).
• They are performed to reduce anxiety through the
belief that they will prevent a ‘dreaded event’ from
occurring, even though they are not realistically
connected to the event (e.g. compulsive counting
each night to prevent ‘family catastrophe’) or are
ridiculously excessive (e.g. spending hours handwashing in response to an obsessive fear of
contamination).
Compulsions are experienced as unpleasant and serve
no realistically useful purpose despite their tensionrelieving properties. Similarly to obsessions, patients resist carrying out compulsions. Resisting compulsions,
however, causes increased anxiety.
Obsessions and compulsions are often closely
linked, as the desire to resist or neutralize an obsession
produces a compulsive act (see Fig. 11.1 for examples of
the most commonly occurring obsessions and compulsions). It can be difficult enquiring about obsessions
and compulsions, especially when patients do not offer
them as a presenting complaint. Figure 11.2 suggests
some useful questions in eliciting these symptoms.

Fig. 11.2 Questions used to elicit obsessions and
compulsions

Do you worry about contamination with dirt even when
you have already washed?
Do you have awful thoughts entering your mind despite
trying hard to keep them out?
Do you repeatedly have to check things that you have
already done (stoves, lights, taps, etc.)?
Do you find that you have to arrange, touch or count
things many times over?

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Obsessions and compulsions may occur as a primary illness as in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or may
be clinical features of other psychiatric conditions. If patients have genuine obsessions or compulsions without
other psychiatric symptoms then the diagnosis is simply
obsessive-compulsive disorder. For a definite diagnosis
the ICD-10 has proposed certain guidelines, as presented in Figure 11.3.
Many other psychiatric conditions may also present
with repetitive or intrusive thoughts, impulses, images
or behaviours (see Fig. 11.4). However, it is usually possible to differentiate them from OCD by applying the
strict definition of obsessions and compulsions. Also,
when repetitive thoughts occur in the context of other
mental disorders, the contents of these thoughts are limited exclusively to the type of disorder concerned, e.g.
morbid fear of fatness in anorexia nervosa, ruminatory
thoughts of worthlessness in depression, fear of dreaded
objects in phobias. Figure 11.5 lists the differential
diagnoses and key distinguishing features of patients
presenting with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.
OCD can also be comorbid with other psychiatric conditions, particularly depression and less commonly
schizophrenia. Figure 11.6 suggests a diagnosis algorithm that may be useful in differentiating OCD from
other psychiatric conditions (see also Fig. 10.5).
Fig. 11.3 ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines for obsessivecompulsive disorder

• Obsessions or compulsions must be present for at least
2 successive weeks and are a source of distress or
interfere with the patient’s functioning
• They are acknowledged as coming from the patient’s
own mind
• The obsessions are unpleasantly repetitive
• At least one thought or act is resisted unsuccessfully
(note that in chronic cases some symptoms may
no longer be resisted)
• A compulsive act is not in itself pleasurable (excluding
the relief of anxiety)

Fig. 11.6 Algorithm for the diagnosis of obsessions and compulsions

HINTS AND TIPS
A key differential for an obsession is a delusion.
They can be distinguished by checking whether
the patient knows the thought is false and a product
of their own mind (an obsession) or believes
it to be true and representing external reality
(a delusion).

You should always consider depression in patients with
obsessions or compulsions because:
• Over 20% of depressed patients can have obsessivecompulsive symptoms, which occur simultaneously
at or after the onset of depression. They invariably
resolve with treatment of the depression.
• Over two-thirds of patients with OCD experience a
depressive episode in their lifetime. Obsessions

88

and compulsions are present before and persist after
the treatment of depression.
• OCD is a disabling illness and patients often
have chronic mild depressive symptoms that
do not fully meet the criteria for a depressive episode. These symptoms usually resolve when the
OCD is treated and the patient’s quality of life
improves.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mr OC has genuine obsessions (recurrent, intrusive
thoughts that are distressing, resisted and recognized as
being from his own mind) and compulsions (repeatedly and excessively seeking reassurance to relieve anxiety caused by obsessions). He also describes symptoms
of depression (depressed mood and weight loss).

Discussion of case study
His most likely diagnosis is obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD); however, it is important to consider depression. In this case, the depressed mood developed after the obsessive-compulsive symptoms. If Mr
OC now met the criteria for a depressive episode then

11

OCD and depression would be diagnosed. He most
probably has mild ‘reactive’ depression, which will resolve when the OCD is treated (see Fig. 11.6).
Now go on to Chapter 20 to read about obsessivecompulsive disorder and its management.

Case summary
Mrs PT, a 28-year-old divorced woman, was referred
to a psychiatrist. She was well and working as a cleaner
until 3 months ago when, on her way to work one
evening, two men cornered her at a secluded bus
shelter. They pushed her to the ground and raped her,
threatening to ‘slit her throat’ if she screamed. The men
ran off when they heard someone approaching, leaving
Mrs PT shaken but with only superficial cuts and
bruises. She felt low in mood for a few days after the
assault, but attempted to carry on with her job and
forget what had happened. In the month that
followed, Mrs PT avoided all attempts by her family
and friends to talk about the incident. She became
socially withdrawn, only leaving the house to go to
work. After a month, she started having nightmares
about the incident and would wake up drenched in
sweat. Her work colleagues noticed that she had
become ‘jumpy and quick-tempered’ and that sudden
movements or noises startled her. She had also started
avoiding public transportation and refused to watch
television for fear that something might remind her of
the rape. Mrs PT finally sought medical help after her
work supervisor found her lying on the floor, seemingly
in a trance, screaming ‘Leave me alone!’ repeatedly.
She recounted to her psychiatrist how she ‘re-lived’ the
rape in her mind and thought she could hear the the
men threatening her, just like they did during the
incident. The psychiatrist noticed that Mrs PT could not
recall certain important aspects of the assault.

It is not unusual to have some psychological symptoms
after a stressful event or bereavement. However, in some
cases, these symptoms may be more severe than
expected, and impact upon everyday functioning. It is
important to be able to distinguish a normal reaction
to a difficult life event from a specific constellation
of symptoms that denote psychopathology requiring
clinical attention.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
When assessing someone who may have had a pathological response to a stressful event, it is important to
explore two variables: (1) the nature and severity of
the life event; and (2) the nature and severity of the
person’s reaction to the life event.

Nature and severity of the life
event
Stress
‘Psychosocial stressor’ is the term used for any life event,
condition or circumstance that places a strain on a person’s current coping skills. It is important to remember
that what constitutes a ‘stressor’ is subjective, and dependent on the specific person’s ability to adapt or respond
to a specific life challenge. For example, one student may
breeze through an exam without experiencing any stress,
while another may feel incredibly strained because of a
perceived (or actual) mismatch between their ability
and the demands of the situation. Also note that the same
person’s coping skills vary throughout their developmental life: the death of a distant relative may be far more
stressful for a middle-aged man contemplating his own
mortality than for an ‘invincible’ adolescent.

91

The patient with a reaction to a stressful event or bereavement
COMMUNICATION
Whenever a patient presents with low mood or
anxiety, always check for possible psychosocial
stressors and establish how (if at all) they relate to
the onset of symptoms. If the stressor seemed
insignificant, verify how it was perceived by the
patient. Remember, a seemingly innocuous life event
may be a significant psychosocial stressor for a
vulnerable patient (e.g. a change of accommodation
for an elderly widow).

Traumatic stress
A traumatic stressor occurs outside the range of normal
human experience, and its magnitude means that it
would be experienced as traumatic by most people. This
type of stress occurs in situations where a person feels
that their own (or a loved one’s) physical or psychological integrity is under serious threat. These include natural disasters, physical or sexual assaults, serious road
traffic accidents, terrorist attacks, torture and military
combat. Bereavement is a special case of traumatic stress
that will be discussed later.

Nature and severity of patient’s
reaction
Some people seem to experience stressful or traumatic
life events with minimal symptoms, while others seem
more susceptible to developing a diagnosable disorder.
Depending on the severity of the stressor and their
underlying vulnerability, patients may develop: (1) an
adjustment disorder; (2) an acute stress reaction or
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (3) a dissociative
disorder; or (4) another major mental illness such as
a depressive, anxiety or psychotic disorder.

Adjustment disorder
Feeling unable to cope is common at times of psychosocial stresses to which we need to adapt or adjust (such as
moving house, changing job or becoming a parent).
However, when symptoms are considered significant
enough to be out of proportion to the original stressor,
or cause disturbance of social or occupational functioning, this can be described as an adjustment disorder.
For this diagnosis to be made, the emotional and/or
behavioural symptoms need to occur within 3 months
(according to DSM-IV; ICD-10 states 1 month) of the
original stressor. Although it is assumed that the disorder would not have arisen without the original stressor,
an individual’s personality and vulnerability to stress
play an important contributing role. Symptoms usually
fully resolve within 6 months of onset, and if this is not

92

the case, consideration should be given to a different
diagnosis.
Usually, adjustment disorder is characterized by
mood and/or anxiety symptoms, and this can occasionally be of severity sufficient to cause disturbances of
conduct (e.g. reckless driving, aggressive behaviour).
Many people with adjustment disorder also experience
suicidal ideation.
HINTS AND TIPS
You should only diagnose an adjustment disorder when
patients do not meet the criteria for a more specific
diagnosis such as mood, psychotic or anxiety disorder
(including PTSD), or a normal bereavement reaction.

Acute stress reaction
The symptoms of an acute stress reaction (combat fatigue, psychic shock) develop immediately after, or
within a few minutes of, a traumatic stressor. Typically,
sufferers will experience an initial ‘dazed’ state followed
by possible disorientation and a narrowing of attention
with inability to process external stimuli. In some cases,
this may be followed either by a period of diminished
responsiveness (to the extreme of a dissociative stupor)
or psychomotor agitation and overactivity. Patients may
also have amnesia for the episode (see Fig. 12.1 for dissociative amnesia and stupor). These symptoms normally begin to diminish after 24–48 hours, and are
usually minimal after 3 days.

Post-traumatic stress disorder
The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
usually develop after 1 month but within 6 months of a
traumatic stressor, and lead to significant distress or
functional impairment. Symptoms include all of the
following:
• Repetitive re-experiencing of the traumatic event in
the form of:
• Flashbacks (intrusive, unwanted memories; vivid
mental images or dreams of the original experience)
• Distress caused by internal or external cues that
resemble the stressor (at times, patients may dissociate and experience the original event as
though it were happening at that moment)
• Patients may also experience hallucinations and
illusions.
• Avoidance of stimuli associated with the stressor,
amnesia for aspects of the trauma, as well as emotional numbness and social withdrawal.
• Increased arousal (insomnia, angry outbursts,
hypervigilance, poor concentration, exaggerated
startle response).

Definitions and clinical features

12

Fig. 12.1 Dissociative (‘conversion’) disorders

Dissociative amnesia

Partial or complete memory loss for events of a traumatic or stressful nature not due to
normal forgetfulness, organic brain disorders or intoxication

Dissociative fugue

Rare disorder characterized by amnesia for personal identity, including memories and
personality. Self-care and social interaction are maintained. Usually short-lived (hours to
days), but can last longer. Very often involves seemingly purposeful travel beyond the
individual’s usual range, and in some cases a new identity may be assumed

Dissociative stupor

Severe psychomotor retardation characterized by extreme unresponsiveness, lack of
voluntary movement and mutism, not due to a physical or psychiatric disorder (that is,
not due to depressive, manic or catatonic stupor)

Dissociative anaesthesia
and sensory loss

Cutaneous or visual sensory loss that does not correspond to anatomic dermatomes or
known neurological patterns

Dissociative motor disorders

Partial or complete paralysis of one or more muscle groups not due to any physical cause

Dissociative convulsions
(psychogenic non-epileptic
seizures)

Used to be known as ‘pseudoseizures’; however, the name has been changed because
of concerns that the term ‘pseudo’ implies a degree of voluntary control (which is not
the case). May present similarly to epileptic seizures but tongue-biting, serious injury
and urinary incontinence are uncommon. There is also absence of epileptic activity on
the electroencephalogram (EEG)

Ganser’s syndrome

Complex disorder characterized by ‘approximate answers’, e.g. when asked what
colour the grass is, an approximate response will be ‘blue’

Multiple personality
disorder (dissociative
identity disorder)

Apparent existence of two or more personalities within the same individual. This is a rare
and highly controversial diagnosis

HINTS AND TIPS
When assessing a patient with suspected PTSD,
remember that head injuries and epilepsy are important
differential diagnoses that may present with similar
symptoms, and may also have been caused by the
initial trauma. Patients with PTSD also have a high rate
of comorbid substance misuse, and it is important to be
vigilant for symptoms of alcohol or drug intoxication/
withdrawal.

Dissociation
In clinical psychiatry, ‘dissociation’ describes a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness
and cognition. In this phenomenon, memories of the
past, awareness of identity, thoughts, emotions, movement, sensation and/or control of behaviour become
separated from the rest of an individual’s personality
such that they function independently and are not open
to voluntary control. Figure 12.1 describes the more
common dissociative disorders.

strange or unreal. These can be considered as types of
dissociation, and may be caused by psychiatric illness
(e.g. depression, anxiety, schizophrenia), physical illness
(e.g. epilepsy), psychosocial stress and substance abuse.

The ICD-10 requires that there be some evidence of
a psychological causation (stressful events or disturbed relationships) in association with the onset of the
dissociative symptoms. Also note that the diagnosis of
dissociative disorder should not be made if there is evidence of a physical or psychiatric disorder that might
explain the symptoms.
Historically, dissociative disorders have been termed
‘hysteria’; however, this term is seldom used in modern
psychiatry. The term ‘conversion disorder’ is often but
not always used synonymously with dissociative disorders, so it is wise to clarify what exact symptoms are being described if this diagnosis is encountered. Also, it is
worth noting that DSM-IV categorizes some dissociative
disorders as somatoform disorders (see Ch. 13).
HINTS AND TIPS

HINTS AND TIPS
Depersonalization is feeling yourself to be strange or
unreal. Derealization is feeling that external reality is

Before accepting the diagnosis of a dissociative
disorder, a neurological affliction or other psychiatric
illness should be aggressively sought for and excluded.

93

The patient with a reaction to a stressful event or bereavement

Precipitation or exacerbation of an
existing mental illness
The influence of a patient’s environment on their mental health cannot be overemphasized. Almost all forms
of mental illness (e.g. depression, psychotic illness,
anxiety) can be precipitated or exacerbated by psychosocial (‘life events’) or traumatic stressors. However, unlike the above reactions in this group, there
need not be a direct aetiological link with the stressor
involved.

BEREAVEMENT
Bereavement is a unique kind of stress experienced by
most people during their life, and is considered a normal human experience. A bereavement reaction usually
occurs after the loss of a loved person but can also result
from other losses, like the loss of a national figure, or a
beloved pet. The normal course of grief after bereavement occurs in five phases (Fig. 12.2), although these
should not be regarded as a rigid sequence that is passed
through only once.

HINTS AND TIPS
The length of a normal bereavement reaction is
variable and tends to be longer if the death was sudden
and unexpected.

Although most people will meet the criteria for a depressive episode at some stage during the grieving process,
bereavement reactions are not pathological and so no
psychiatric diagnosis should be made in these cases.
However, patients who have been bereaved are at higher
risk for developing a depressive illness requiring treatment. The DSM-IV notes the following symptoms are
not characteristic of a normal bereavement reaction
and suggest the development of a major depressive
episode:
1. Guilt (other than events surrounding the death of
the loved one).
2. Suicidal ideation (other than feeling better off dead
or wanting to be with the deceased).
3. Preoccupation with worthlessness.
4. Marked psychomotor retardation.

Alarm
A highly stressed emotional state coupled with physiological arousal (increased heart rate and blood pressure)

Numbness
A state of being emotionally disconnected – a form of self-protection against the acute pain of loss

Pining
A state where the bereaved is constantly reminded of, and preoccupied with, the deceased. Marked by ‘pangs of grief’
and intense anxiety. Hypnagogic, hypnopompic, pseudohallucinations and illusions of the
deceased may occur; these are transient and always involve the dead person

Depression and despair
A state where the bereaved have a depressed and irritable mood, thoughts of being ‘better off dead’ or that
they should have died with the deceased, anhedonia, loss of appetite and weight, insomnia,
impaired concentration and short-term memory

Recovery and reorganization
Acceptance of loss; return of food, social, and sexual appetite; weight is regained; grief
diminishes but may return for a time at anniversaries of the deceased

Fig. 12.2 Parkes’s stages of normal bereavement

94

Discussion of case study
5. Prolonged and marked functional impairment.
6. Hallucinatory experiences (other than transiently
seeing or hearing the deceased).
If a bereavement reaction is abnormal, assess for
depression. If criteria for a depressive episode are
not met, then a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is
made.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis is usually clear following thorough exploration of the nature and severity of both the life event and
patient’s reaction (see Fig. 12.3 and Fig. 10.5 for a diagnostic algorithm). Even if the onset of symptoms is
clearly linked with a stressor, diagnosis of a specific major
mental illness (mood disorder, psychotic disorder)
should be given if diagnostic criteria are met, as major
mental illnesses are often triggered by major stressors.
If a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms after
a life-threatening event, always screen for features of
depression as well as features of PTSD. This is because
the risk of developing depression increases six fold in
the 6 months that follow a stressful event.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mrs PT experienced a traumatic stressor in which she believed that her physical integrity was under immediate
threat. The event was outside the range of normal human

experience and would have been experienced as traumatic by most people. She subsequently developed
avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma (avoided
talking or thinking about it, avoided public transportation and television), amnesia for aspects of the trauma
and social withdrawal. Later on, she showed signs of increased arousal (startle response, being ‘jumpy and
quick-tempered’). Finally, Mrs PT repetitively reexperienced the trauma through nightmares, flashbacks
and dissociation (re-living and behaving as though the
trauma were occurring at that moment through mental
imagery and hallucinations). All of the above suggest a
diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Case summary
Mrs SD, a 32-year-old mother of three, had consulted
her GP at least once every 2 weeks for the past
year. Her GP had known her for just over a year
since she moved to the area after an acrimonious
divorce. Her medical history, part of which was
obtained from her previous GP, was substantial,
and her health difficulties had precluded her from
employment. At menarche, she was diagnosed
with dysfunctional uterine bleeding and
dysmenorrhoea. Later, extensive investigations,
including three exploratory laparoscopies, revealed
no physical cause for persistent upper abdominal
pain with alternating diarrhoea and constipation.
Three years ago, Mrs SD presented with urinary
frequency and dysuria. Exhaustive investigations
including cystoscopy, urodynamic studies and
radiography, were all normal. She had also been
referred to various specialists including a
rheumatologist due to chronic neck pain that
she had described as: ‘the pain that has ruined
mine and my kids’ life!’ Again, physical examination
and investigations revealed no abnormalities.
Mrs SD was taking up to 30 codeine tablets daily
and could not sleep without two different types of
sleeping tablets. Despite a difficult childhood,
which featured a violent, alcohol-abusing father,
and two abusive marriages that had ended in
divorce, Mrs SD refused to contemplate her
doctor’s suggestion that there might be a
psychological explanation for her symptoms.
However, she eventually agreed to an

appointment with a psychiatrist when she
developed hearing loss after her 13-year-old
daughter became pregnant.

(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

The historical description of the mind–body duality
(the relationship between the mind, or ‘psyche’; and
the body, or ‘soma’) is well known, and it is clear that
the mind and the body are not the separate entities
they were once considered. In the same way that physical illness can have an effect on the brain (e.g. delirium), psychological disturbances can manifest as
physical symptoms (e.g. dry mouth).
In recent years, medically unexplained physical
symptoms have been described as ‘functional symptoms’ (rather than symptoms as a result of ‘structural’
or pathological disease). Many specialties have become
very adept at identifying and managing symptoms. It is
also worth noting that even though no structural disease
has been identified, it does not mean that one does not
exist – it may remain undiscovered thus far to medical
science. For example: epilepsy, migraine, multiple sclerosis and stomach ulcers were historically considered
‘functional’ illnesses.
However, often the patterns of such symptoms involve multiple systems, or are clearly associated with a
great deal of anxiety or obvious psychosocial stressor.
If functional symptoms are associated with significant
anxiety or stress, or a comorbid psychiatric illness, it
can be useful to refer to psychiatry.
Patients with functional symptoms are often stigmatized by healthcare providers, with their genuine difficulties being labelled ‘fat folder syndrome’, ‘all in the

97

The patient with medically unexplained physical symptoms
mind’ and ‘the worried well’. Having an understanding
of the psychiatric disorders that may mimic physical
illness, and the impairment that can result, is invaluable
for all junior doctors.

unintentionally, as opposed to the intentional feigning
or production of symptoms in factitious disorder and
malingering.
COMMUNICATION

COMMUNICATION
Many of the terms used for medically unexplained
symptoms are perceived as stigmatizing but the term
‘functional symptoms’ is acceptable to most patients
and colleagues. Functional symptoms are those
without identifiable structural cause. They can be
likened to ‘software’ rather than ‘hardware’ problems
in the body.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
A structural or physical cause should always be considered
in response to reported ‘physical symptoms’. However, in
certain cases, the reported symptoms:
• Do not correspond to, or are clearly not typical of,
any known physical condition.
• Are associated with an absence of any physical signs
or structural abnormalities.
• Are associated with an absence of any abnormalities
in comprehensive laboratory, imaging and invasive
investigations.
In these cases, psychiatric illness should be considered,
especially when unexplained physical symptoms bear a
close relationship with stressful life events or psychological difficulties.
COMMUNICATION
To avoid confusion, you should be able to readily define
‘somatoform disorder’, ‘somatization disorder’,
‘hypochondriacal disorder’, and be able to distinguish
them from the ‘somatic syndrome of depression’,
‘factitious disorder’ and ‘malingering’.

Somatoform disorders
The somatoform disorders are a class of disorders whose
symptoms are suggestive of, or take the form of, physical
illness. However, there are no detectable structural or
neurophysiological abnormalities to explain these
symptoms, leading to the presumption that they are
caused by psychological factors. Note that these symptoms are not under voluntary control: they occur

98

It is important to acknowledge that even though
no physical disease has been found, the functional
impairment and distress caused by somatoform
disorders is genuine and that the symptoms are neither
under conscious control nor are they being feigned.
Empathic acknowledgement and explanation can be
very therapeutic in itself. Dismissing a patient by telling
them that their symptoms are ‘all in your mind’ is
unhelpful and potentially harmful.

Somatization disorder (Briquet’s
syndrome)
The central features of somatization disorder are multiple, recurrent and frequently changing physical symptoms, with the absence of identifiable physiological
explanation. These include:
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, food intolerance, abdominal pain.
• Sexual or reproductive: loss of libido, ejaculatory or
erectile dysfunction, irregular menses, menorrhagia,
dysmenorrhoea.
• Urinary: dysuria, frequency, urinary retention,
incontinence.
• Neurological: paralysis, paraesthesia, sensory loss,
seizures, difficulty swallowing, impaired coordination or balance.
To meet diagnostic criteria, patients should have numerous symptoms from almost all of these systemic groups,
not just one or two isolated symptoms.
For the diagnosis of somatization disorder, the
ICD-10 suggests that all of the following be present:
• At least 2 years of symptoms with no physical explanation found.
• Persistent refusal by the patient to accept reassurance
from several doctors that there is no physical cause
for the symptoms.
• Some degree of functional impairment due to the
symptoms and resulting behaviour.
Most patients with somatization disorder will have a
long history of contact with medical services, during
which numerous investigations may have been conducted. This often results in iatrogenic disease with physically explainable symptoms (e.g. abdominal adhesions
from frequent exploratory surgery). Due to frequent
courses of medication, these patients are often dependent on analgesics and sedatives.

Definitions and clinical features

13

Hypochondriacal disorder

Persistent somatoform pain disorder

In hypochondriacal disorder, patients misinterpret normal bodily sensations, which lead them to believe that
they have a serious and progressive physical disease.
These patients tend to ask for investigations to definitively diagnose or confirm their underlying disease.
However, despite repeated normal examination and investigations, hypochondriacal patients refuse to accept
the reassurance of numerous doctors that they do not
suffer from a serious physical illness. This is in contrast
to somatization disorder, where patients tend to seek relief from their symptoms.

The central feature of this disorder is severe and persistent pain that cannot be fully explained by physical
illness. The pain usually occurs in association with emotional difficulties or psychosocial stressors. Although patients with somatization disorder may have symptoms of
pain, they also have numerous symptoms from multiple
systems and pain is not the overwhelmingly dominant
symptom.

Body dysmorphic disorder
Body dysmorphic disorder (dysmorphophobia) is a variant of hypochondriacal disorder, in which patients are
preoccupied with an imagined or minor defect in their
physical appearance. ICD-10 considers this a subtype of
hypochondriacal disorder; however, DSM-IV considers
it a somatoform disorder in its own right. The symptoms should not be better accounted for by another disorder (e.g. concerns regarding weight and body shape
are usually more accurately attributed to an eating disorder). This imagined defect or deformity can concern
any part of the body (e.g. a ‘crooked nose’ or ‘ugly
hands’). The preoccupation causes significant distress
or impairment in functioning.
The psychopathology of both hypochondriacal disorder and body dysmorphic disorder takes the form
of an overvalued idea (see p. 68). The belief is not delusional because patients are open to some explanation
and their fears can be allayed, at least for a short while.
A persistent delusional disorder (somatic delusional
disorder) is diagnosed if the belief is held with delusional intensity (see p. 67).

Somatoform autonomic dysfunction
Patients with this disorder have two types of symptoms,
both concerning the autonomic nervous system. The
first is characterized by objective evidence of autonomic
arousal (e.g. sweating, palpitations and tremor). The
second is characterized by more subjective symptoms
(e.g. pains, burning, heaviness, tightness or feeling
bloated). Patients attribute these to a particular organ
or system that is largely under autonomic control, e.g.
the cardiovascular system (Da Costa’s syndrome), the
respiratory system (psychogenic hyperventilation), or
the gastrointestinal system (irritable bowel syndrome).
Although patients with somatization disorder may have
autonomic symptoms, they also have numerous other
symptoms from multiple systems and the autonomic
symptoms are not attributed to only one organ or
system as in somatoform autonomic dysfunction.

Conversion and dissociative
disorders
‘Conversion’ is a psychoanalytical term that describes
the hypothetical process whereby psychic conflict or
pain undergoes ‘conversion’ into somatic or physical
form to produce physical symptoms. The DSM-IV uses
the term to describe the presence of one or more neurological symptoms that are not explained by any known
neurological disease. ICD-10 considers these to be dissociative disorders. This book considers these in
Chapter 12.

Factitious disorder and
malingering
Both factitious disorder and malingering differ from
somatoform disorders in that physical or psychological
symptoms are produced intentionally or feigned.
Patients may give convincing histories that fool even
experienced clinicians and often manufacture signs
(e.g. warfarin may be ingested to simulate bleeding
disorders, insulin may be injected to produce hypoglycaemia, urine may be contaminated with blood or faeces). Certain patients feign psychiatric symptoms such
as hallucinations, delusions, depression or dissociation.
These patients can go undetected and may receive large
doses of psychotropic medication.

Factitious disorder (Münchausen’s
syndrome)
The central feature of factitious disorder is focus on the
primary (internal) gain of assuming the sick role (the
aim to be cared for like a patient, usually in hospital).
Although symptoms are feigned, it is important to understand that this care-seeking behaviour is usually a
manifestation of psychological distress.

Malingering
Malingering patients focus on secondary (external) gain
of the secondary consequence of being diagnosed with
an illness (avoidance of military service, evading criminal prosecution, obtaining illicit drugs, obtaining benefits or compensation).

99

The patient with medically unexplained physical symptoms

Münchausen syndrome by proxy
Also known as ‘fabricated or induced illness’, this describes a form of abuse where a carer (classically a parent) will seek help for fabricated or induced symptoms
in a dependant (classically a child). The psychological
aim of the carer is for the dependant to be cared for like
a patient. The induction of a factitious disorder can be
dangerous (e.g. covert poisoning) and once a diagnosis
has been made, the dependent should be removed from
the direct influence of the carer, and relevant authorities
(most often child/adult protection agencies) alerted.
The affected carer should be offered psychiatric help;
however, because the disorder is rare, little is known
about effective treatment.

resolve with the treatment of the depression. Patients
with panic disorder have multiple somatic symptoms
while having panic attacks, but these resolve when the
panic subsides. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder
may also have multiple somatic preoccupations, but their
anxiety is not limited to physical symptoms. Conversion
and dissociative disorders (e.g. motor disorders, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures) can present with neurological symptoms without any evidence of an organic cause.
However, these symptoms are usually clearly defined and
isolated as opposed to the ill-defined, multiple symptoms in somatization disorder. The difficulty in distinguishing other mental disorders from somatization
disorder is illustrated by the observation that at least half
of patients with somatization disorder have another
coexisting mental illness.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis for patients presenting with medically unexplained symptoms is shown in Figure 13.1. The
flow chart in Figure 13.2 can help with reaching the correct
diagnosis.
An underlying medical condition should be ruled
out when patients present with unexplained physical
symptoms. Somatization disorder can resemble insidious multi-system diseases such as systemic lupus
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), hyperparathyroidism, occult malignancy and chronic infections.
Physical complaints often occur in the context of
other psychiatric conditions. Patients with schizophrenia
may have somatic delusions or visceral somatic hallucinations. However, the explanation of these symptoms
is often quite odd and there are usually other psychotic
symptoms accompanying the physical complaints. Individuals with depressed mood often present with numerous somatic complaints; these tend to be episodic and

HINTS AND TIPS
Somatization disorder usually has its onset in
early adult life. The onset of multiple physical
symptoms late in life is more likely to be due to
a physical illness.

ASSESSMENT

History
The following questions may be helpful in screening for
somatoform disorders on mental state examination:
•
•
•
•
•

Do you often worry about your health?
Are you bothered by many different symptoms?
Are you concerned you may have a serious illness?
Are you concerned about your appearance?
Do you find it hard to believe doctors when they tell
you that there is nothing wrong with you?

Examination
A thorough physical examination with special focus on
the presenting problem is imperative when dealing with
somatoform complaints.

Investigations
Clinicians dealing with patients with a somatoform
disorder need to investigate physical complaints judiciously. It is important to take all symptoms seriously,
yet excessive and needless investigations to placate an
anxious patient can result in a vicious circle with worsening of symptoms. Invasive investigations can result in

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mrs SD has a long history of multiple, recurrent, frequently changing physical symptoms for which no
physical causes have been found despite extensive investigation. She is resistant to the idea that there might be a
psychological reason for her symptoms despite the association of her symptoms with psychosocial stress. Her
functioning has been impaired, and this has possibly

impacted on her children’s lives. Because she is focused
on symptoms, not the idea that she has a serious and
progressive illness, Mrs SD has somatization disorder
as opposed to hypochondriacal disorder. As is typical,
Mrs SD has a secondary (possibly iatrogenic) substance
misuse problem (codeine and sleeping tablets). It would
be important to exclude other mental illness, such as depression and anxiety, as causative factors. If there was evidence that Mrs SD intentionally produced or feigned her
symptoms then factitious disorder or malingering
should be considered.
Now go on to Chapter 20 to read about the somatoform disorders and their management.

Case summary
Mr DD, aged 78 years, lived at home with his wife with
carers visiting twice daily. His general practitioner (GP)
had referred him to a psychiatrist 6 years earlier, after
he started experiencing difficulty remembering things.
At first he would forget things like the social
arrangements he had made. Later he started forgetting
activities he had engaged in only the day before. His
wife had noticed a gradual change in his personality
in that he became increasingly withdrawn and sullen
and, at times, verbally aggressive. His language
deteriorated to the point where he would ramble
incoherently, even when there was no one else in the
room. Despite having smoked for many years,
Mr DD seemed unable to recognize his pipe and would
stare at it quizzically for hours. He lost the ability to
dress himself or complete simple multi-step tasks
such as making a cup of coffee.
His wife contacted their GP when one morning
Mr DD was too sleepy to get out of bed. The GP
arranged hospital admission for further investigation.
Nurses were concerned because his consciousness
level was fluctuating from hour to hour. He slept
through most of the day, but would wander around
the ward at night looking very agitated and
appeared to have visual hallucinations. The senior
nurse pointed out that he had developed a
productive cough.

Cognitive impairment is common and important, but
often under-diagnosed and under-investigated. It is associated with a high morbidity and mortality and you
are likely to frequently encounter people with cognitive
impairment in most specialities.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES

Consciousness
To be conscious is to be aware, both of the environment
and of oneself as a subjective being. It is a global cognitive function. It is a poorly understood, complex phenomenon with multiple vaguely defined terms for its
abnormalities. It is best to avoid terms such as ‘confused’, ‘obtunded’, ‘clouding of consciousness’, ‘stupor’
as they are not well defined and mean different things to
different specialities. Clinically, the key question is
whether someone has a normal or altered consciousness level. This is assessed at a practical level by observing arousal level (hyperaroused or lowered) (Fig. 14.1).

Cognition
This chapter considers ‘cognition’ in its broadest sense as
meaning all the mental activities that allow us to perceive,
integrate and conceptualize the world around us. These
include the global functions of consciousness, attention
and orientation and the specific domains of memory, executive function, language, praxis and perception. The
term ‘cognition’ is used more narrowly in cognitive psychology and cognitive therapy where individual thoughts
or ideas are also referred to as ‘cognitions’.

Fig. 14.1 Assessment of consciousness level

Impairments in cognition can be generalized (multiple domains) or specific (one domain only). An altered
level of consciousness is generally associated with a generalized impairment in all aspects of cognition, as it is
difficult to concentrate on any tasks when feeling very
agitated or drowsy.
A very large number of specific cognitive impairments
exist (Fig. 14.2). These can be isolated impairments, for
example, if they are developmental or secondary to a small
cerebrovascular accident, or occur together in disorders of
generalized cognitive impairment such as dementia.

Memory
Memory is one of the commonest cognitive domains to
be impaired. There are two main ways to categorize
memory: the duration of storage (working or long term)
or the type of information stored (implicit or explicit).
Explicit memory (sometimes called declarative memory)
includes all stored material of which the individual is
consciously aware and can thus ‘declare’ to others.
Implicit memory (sometimes called procedural memory)
includes all material that is stored without the

104

individual’s conscious awareness, e.g. the ability to
speak a language or ride a bicycle.
Explicit memory is the most common type of memory
to be disrupted. It can be further subdivided into semantic
and episodic memory. Semantic memory is knowledge of
facts, e.g. Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland. Episodic
memory is knowledge of autobiographical events, e.g. remembering a trip to Edinburgh when you were 10 years
old. See Figure 14.3 for the characteristics of different
durations of explicit memory, and how to test them.
COMMUNICATION
There are different ways of classifying memory, and
different terms have similar or overlapping meanings. For
example, some clinicians use the term ‘short-term
memory’ to mean recent long-term memory whereas
others mean working memory. Therefore, when
speaking to colleagues it can be useful to define the
type of memory referred to by what test was used to
measure it.

Description

Language

Dysphasia/aphasia

Loss of language abilities despite intact sensory and motor
function, e.g. difficulty in understanding commands or other words
(receptive dysphasia) or difficulty using words with correct
meaning (expressive dysphasia). Not being able to name items
correctly despite knowing what they are (nominal dysphasia)
is a subtype of expressive dysphasia

Praxis

Dyspraxia/apraxia

Loss of ability to carry out skilled motor movements despite
intact motor function, e.g. inability to put a letter in an envelope, use
a tin-opener, button up a shirt

Perception

Dysgnosia/agnosia

Loss of ability to interpret sensory information despite intact sensory
organ function, e.g. not able to recognize faces as familiar

the 1960s?

Amnesia refers to the loss of the ability to store new
memories or retrieve memories that have previously
been stored. Anterograde amnesia occurs after an
amnesia-causing event and results in the patient being
unable to store new memories from the event onwards
(impaired learning of new material), although the
ability to retrieve memories stored before the event
may remain unimpaired. Anterograde amnesia usually
results from damage to the medial temporal lobes,
especially the hippocampal formation.
Retrograde amnesia occurs after an amnesia-causing
event and results in the patient being unable to retrieve
memories stored before the event, although the ability

to store new memories from the event onwards may
remain unaffected. Retrograde amnesia usually results
from damage to the frontal or temporal cortex.
HINTS AND TIPS
Implicit memory (procedural memory) is typically
preserved despite severe disruptions to explicit
(declarative) memory, probably due to its independent
neural location. Implicit memory is associated with
basal ganglia circuitry. Explicit memory is associated
with the hippocampal and diencephalic structures.

COMMON COGNITIVE
DISORDERS

Fig. 14.4 Causes of delirium
(anything that disrupts homeostasis)

Systemic illness

Delirium

Infections and sepsis

If someone has acute or fluctuating cognitive impairment and is drowsy or agitated, they are very likely to
have delirium. Psychotic features such as hallucinations
or persecutory delusions are often present but are not
essential to make the diagnosis. Delirium often fluctuates, so a patient may appear normal on the morning
ward round but cognitively impaired and agitated in
the evening. Delirium usually resolves when the trigger
is treated, but sometimes can be prolonged for weeks or
months.
Delirium can be a final common pathway of severe
injury to the brain or body, and is a marker of severity
of illness (e.g. the ‘C’ in the CURB65 score for severity of
community acquired pneumonia). It has a high mortality, with around a third of sufferers dying during the presentation. It is therefore a medical emergency and the
cause should be aggressively investigated and treated
(Fig. 14.4). It is particularly common in those with ‘at
risk’ brains, such as those with pre-existing dementia.
In individuals with vulnerable brains a relatively minor
insult can result in delirium, e.g. dehydration or a new
medication. Delirium is also a risk factor for development or worsening of dementia.
The terms ‘acute confusional state’ and ‘encephalopathy’
have roughly the same meaning as delirium. Prominent
symptoms of delirium are described further below.

Anoxia
• Respiratory failure
• Heart failure
• Myocardial infarction

HINTS AND TIPS
Risk factors for delirium include an abnormal brain (e.g.
dementia or previous serious head injury), age,
polypharmacy and sensory impairment.

Metabolic and endocrine
• Electrolyte disturbances
• Uraemia
• Hepatic encephalopathy
• Porphyria
• Hypoglycaemia
• Hyper- and hypothyroidism
• Hyper- and hypoparathyroidism
• Hyper- and hypoadrenocorticism (Cushing’s
syndrome, Addison’s disease)
• Hypopituitarism
Nutritional
• Thiamine (Wernicke’s encephalopathy), vitamin B12,
folic acid or niacin deficiency
Drugs (use or discontinuation)
Prescribed (plus many more)
• Anticholinergics
• Benzodiazepines
• Opiates
• Antiparkinsonian drugs
• Steroids
Recreational
• Alcohol (delirium tremens, see p. 155)
• Opiates
• Cannabis
• Amfetamines
Poisons
• Heavy metals (lead, mercury, manganese)
• Carbon monoxide
Intracranial causes

Impaired consciousness

Space-occupying lesions
• Tumours, cysts, abscesses, haematomas

Patients may have a reduced level of consciousness
ranging from drowsiness to coma (hypoactive delirium),
or they can be hypervigilant and agitated (hyperactive
delirium). Their ability to sustain attention is reduced
and they are easily distractible.

Head injury (especially concussion)
Infection
• Meningitis
• Encephalitis

Impaired cognitive function
Short-term memory and recent memory are impaired
with relative preservation of remote memory. Patients
with delirium are almost always disorientated to time and
often to place. Orientation to self is seldom lost. Language
abnormalities such as rambling, incoherent speech and
an impaired ability to understand are common.

106

Epilepsy
Cerebrovascular disorders
• Transient ischaemic attack
• Cerebral thrombosis or embolism
• Intracerebral or subarachnoid
haemorrhage
• Hypertensive encephalopathy
• Vasculitis (e.g. from systemic lupus
erythematosus)

Common cognitive disorders

14

Perceptual and thought disturbance

Memory impairment

Patients may have perceptual disturbances ranging from
misinterpretations (e.g. a door slamming is mistaken
for an explosion) to illusions (e.g. a crack in the wall
is perceived as a snake) to hallucinations (especially
visual and, to a lesser extent, auditory). Transient persecutory delusions and delusions of misidentification
may occur.

Impairment of memory is a common feature of dementia. Recent memory is first affected, e.g. forgetting where
objects are placed, conversations and events of the previous day. With disease progression, all aspects of memory are affected, although highly personal information
(name, previous occupation, etc.) is usually retained
until late in the disease. Note that memory is essential
for orientation to person, place and time and this will
also be gradually affected, e.g. patients may lose their
way in their own house.

Sleep–wake cycle disturbance
Sleep is characteristically disturbed and can range from
daytime drowsiness and night-time hyperactivity to a
complete reversal of the normal cycle. Nightmares
experienced by patients with delirium may continue
as hallucinations after awakening.

Other cognitive symptoms (aphasia,
apraxia, agnosia, impaired executive
functioning)
See Figure 14.2.

Mood disturbance
Emotional disturbances such as depression, euphoria,
anxiety, anger, fear and apathy are common.
HINTS AND TIPS
A physical illness should always be ruled out
whenever a patient presents with prominent visual
hallucinations because patients with schizophrenia or
psychotic mood disorders usually experience auditory
hallucinations.

Dementia
Dementia is a syndrome of acquired progressive generalized cognitive impairment associated with functional
decline. Consciousness level is normal. Symptoms should
be present for 6 months before a diagnosis can be confirmed. The following text describes the general categories
of impairment in dementia.

Behavioural and psychological symptoms
of dementia
‘Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia’
(BPSD) is an umbrella term for non-cognitive symptoms associated with dementia, including changes in
behaviour, mood and psychosis. Behavioural symptoms
are very common and include pacing, shouting, sexual
disinhibition, aggression and apathy. Depression and
anxiety may occur in up to half of all those with dementia. Delusions, especially persecutory, may occur in up
to 40% of patients. Hallucinations in all sensory modalities (visual more common) occur in up to 30% of patients. BPSD can be similar to those of delirium, but
generally have a more gradual onset and consciousness
level is normal. See Figure 14.5 for more ways to differentiate BPSD from delirium.

Neurological symptoms
Between 10% and 20% of patients will experience seizures. Primitive reflexes (e.g. grasp, snout, suck) may
also be evident as well as myoclonic jerks.

Functional impairment
Functional impairment must be present to make a diagnosis of dementia. Functional impairment means difficulties with basic or instrumental activities of daily living
(ADL). Basic ADLs refer to self-care tasks such as eating,
dressing, washing, toileting, continence and mobility
(being able to make crucial movements such as from
bed to chair to toilet). Instrumental ADLs refer to tasks
which are not crucial to life but which allow someone
to live independently, such as cooking, shopping and
housework. As well as being diagnostically important,
someone’s ability to perform ADLs determines what level
of support they need – home carers or 24-hour care.

COMMUNICATION
When seeing a new patient with a likely diagnosis
of dementia, always take a collateral history as
patients may have poor insight and recall of their
difficulties.

Distinguishing the type of dementia
Dementia can result from a primary neurodegenerative
process or be secondary to substance use or another
medical condition. Early onset dementia begins before

age 65 years. A small number of cases are due to treatable,
potentially reversible causes (see Fig. 14.6). However, the
most common causes of dementia are neurodegeneration and/or vascular disease. Figure 14.7 describes
the distinguishing clinical features of the various types
of dementias although clinically it is often very difficult
to tell exactly what form of dementia is present, and
definitive diagnosis can normally only be made by
post-mortem. It is important to establish the likely
underlying type of dementia because:
• A secondary dementia-causing process (e.g. brain
tumour) may be detected and possibly halted.
• The progress of certain types of dementia may be
slowed with specific medication (e.g. cholinesterase
inhibitors in Alzheimer’s disease).
• Certain drugs may be contraindicated in some dementias (e.g. antipsychotics can cause a catastrophic
parkinsonian reaction in patients with dementia
with Lewy bodies).
• The prognoses of the various dementias differ;
this may have practical implications for patients
and their families as regards final arrangements,
e.g. wills.

In a minority of cases the distinction will be obvious,
based on other symptoms produced by the disease process, e.g. jerky movements of the face and body (chorea)
and a positive family history would be suggestive of
Huntington’s disease. In the majority of cases, the different dementias may be distinguished to some degree
based on a detailed history from the patient and an

authors differentiate cortical, subcortical and mixed

aetiology and neuropathology of the various
neurodegenerative dementias in Chapter 25,
pp. 173–176.

may require a collateral history)

and delirium. Figure 14.5 summarizes the factors
differentiating delirium from dementia – learn it well.
HINTS AND TIPS
Dementia and delirium are by far the most common
causes of generalized cognitive impairment. The key
question in differentiating them is the duration of
impairment: is it acute, chronic or acute-on-chronic? The
patient may not be able to tell you, but their notes or a
collateral history from a relative or GP can be invaluable.

Mild cognitive impairment
• Is the cognitive impairment causing functional
impairment?
• Are there any other associated symptoms? (e.g. mood
change, personality change, perceptual disturbance).
Chronic impairment in multiple cognitive domains is
due most often to dementia, mild cognitive impairment
or depression (see Fig. 14.10 for more differentials).
Sometimes a patient has an isolated impairment (see
Fig. 14.2 for examples), most often due to a head injury
or cerebrovascular accident. Causes of isolated amnesia
(amnesic syndrome) are considered in more detail at
the end of the section (p. 112).
HINTS AND TIPS
When taking the history of a patient with cognitive
impairment, always clarify the rate of onset and the
course of the symptoms. Delirium is acute in onset,
and usually short term, while dementia has a very
gradual onset and is a chronic disorder. Lewy body
dementia and multi-infarct dementia are the only
dementias that feature transient episodes of
impaired consciousness as a typical feature.
All other dementias do not feature an
impairment of consciousness unless complicated
by a delirium.

Dementia
See Common cognitive disorders section, above, for
clinical features.

Mild cognitive impairment is objective cognitive impairment (confirmed with a standardized test) that does
not interfere notably with activities of daily living. Mild
cognitive impairment is a risk state for dementia, with
around 10–15% of patients converting to dementia
each year. However, in some cases the impairment remains stable or even improves. All the processes that
cause dementia can also cause mild cognitive impairment so it is normally investigated in the same way.

Subjective cognitive impairment
Subjective cognitive impairment is when a patient complains of cognitive problems but scores normally on
standardized tests. It can reflect anxiety or depression,
but can also represent early deterioration in a highly
educated individual that is unidentifiable using standard tests. People with subjective memory impairment
are at increased risk of later developing mild cognitive
impairment or dementia.

Stable cognitive impairment
Some ‘one off’ insults to the brain can impair one or
more aspects of cognition but not cause progressive
deterioration. For example, following a cerebrovascular
accident, hypoxic brain injury, traumatic brain injury or
viral encephalitis. Improvement post insult can occur
over several months so it is important not to make a
firm diagnosis of stable chronic impairment too soon.
Often someone who has had one cerebrovascular accident continues to suffer further episodes, so an initially
stable post-stroke cognitive impairment can evolve into
vascular dementia.

Distinguishing between delirium
and dementia

Depression

Older adults presenting with both physical health
problems and generalized cognitive impairment are a
very common clinical scenario and it is imperative that
you understand how to differentiate between dementia

Depressive ‘pseudodementia’ is a term used when patients
present with clinical features resembling a dementia that
result from an underlying depression. Both depression
and dementia can be associated with a gradual onset of

111

The patient with impairment of consciousness, memory or cognition
low mood, anorexia, sleep disturbance and generalized
cognitive and functional impairment, and they can be very
difficult to distinguish. If there is uncertainty, treatment for
depression is trialled and cognition rechecked after mood
has improved. Unfortunately, depression presenting as
pseudodementia is a risk factor for later dementia.

Psychosis
Patients with schizophrenia often have multiple cognitive deficits, particularly relating to memory, but unlike
dementia, the age of onset is earlier and psychotic symptoms are present from the start. The disturbed behaviour, vivid hallucinations, distractibility and thought
disorder of acutely psychotic patients may resemble a
delirium. However, careful examination will reveal that
the consciousness level is not altered.

Intellectual disability
Patients with intellectual disability have an IQ below
70 with an impaired ability to adapt to their social
environment. Unlike dementia, intellectual disability
manifests in the developmental period (before age 18)
and the level of cognitive functioning tends to be stable
over time, not progressively deteriorating. See Chapter 28.

Dissociative disorders
Memory loss and altered consciousness levels can occur
in the dissociative disorders (see p. 93), e.g. dissociative
amnesia, fugue and stupor. These usually occur in younger adults, there is no evidence of a physical cause and
they are usually precipitated by a psychosocial stressor.

• There is strong evidence of a brain disease known to
cause the amnesic syndrome.
Although there is no impairment of global cognitive
functioning, patients with the amnesic syndrome are
usually disorientated in time due to their inability to
learn new material (anterograde amnesia). Other associated features are confabulation (filling of gaps in
memory with details which are fictitious, but often
plausible), lack of insight and apathy.
The commonest cause of amnesic syndrome is thiamine deficiency resulting in Wernicke’s encephalopathy
followed by Korsakoff’s syndrome. See pages 119 and
154 for details.
HINTS AND TIPS
Due to their unimpaired intellectual functioning,
tendency to confabulate and lack of insight, patients with
an amnesic syndrome can appear deceptively ‘normal’.
Therefore, as in dementia, a collateral history is crucial.

Amnesic syndrome
While dementia is the most common cause of chronic
memory dysfunction overall, certain brain diseases
can cause a severe disruption of memory with minimal
or no deterioration in other cognitive functions. This is
termed the amnesic syndrome and usually results from
damage to the hypothalamic–diencephalic system or
the hippocampal region (see Fig. 14.11 for the causes
of amnesic syndrome). The amnesic syndrome is characterized by all of the following:
• Anterograde and retrograde amnesia. The impairment
of memory for past events is in reverse order of their
occurrence, i.e. recent memories are the most affected.
• There is no impairment of attention or consciousness or global intellectual functioning. There is also
no defect of short-term (primary or working) memory as tested by digit span.

112

ASSESSMENT

History
The following questions may be helpful in eliciting
symptoms of cognitive impairment:
To the patient:
• Do you find yourself forgetting familiar people’s
names?
• Do you get lost more easily than you used to?
• Are you able to handle money confidently?
• Do you feel being forgetful is stopping you from
doing anything?
To the informant:
• Are they repetitive in conversation?

14

Assessment
• Has their personality changed?
• Are their memory problems getting in the way of
their day to day life?
• Do you have any concerns about their safety?

Examination
Cognitive examination
The key thing when assessing cognition is to use a standardized test and avoid vague descriptions such as ‘alert
and orientated’. Many patients maintain a good social
veneer, making it surprisingly easy to miss cognitive impairment if it is not formally assessed. There is a wide
range of tests available of varying comprehensiveness,
length and generalizability across cultures. The one
you choose depends on the time available and degree
of concern about a patient’s cognition. In the UK, it is
recommended that all hospital in-patients aged > 65
years have their cognition screened whether or not they
appear impaired. Figure 14.12 lists the advantages and
disadvantages of some widely used screening tests.
There are many more cognitive tests which may be useful for specific disorders, e.g. the Wisconsin card test to
assess frontal lobe function. Assessment of consciousness level was described in Figure 14.1.
HINTS AND TIPS
Try to ensure the result of a cognitive assessment reflects
cognitive abilities rather than other difficulties as far as
possible: ensure the patient has their glasses and/or
hearing aid, is not hungry, needing the toilet or exhausted.

Physical examination
A physical examination, including a neurological examination, is important in everyone with cognitive impairment as it may provide evidence of:
• Reversible causes of impairment such as hypothyroidism or a space occupying lesion.
• Risk factors for dementia, e.g. hypertension or atrial
fibrillation.
• Differential diagnosis of dementia, e.g. a hemiparesis or visual field defect suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident and hence increased risk of vascular
dementia.
• Complications of impairment such as self-neglect or
injuries from falls.

Investigations
The main aim of investigation in cognitive impairment
is to exclude reversible causes (Fig. 14.13). In delirium,
additional investigations for acute illness are likely to be
appropriate, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and
a septic screen in the presence of infective symptoms or
pyrexia.
Although some types of dementia have characteristic
radiological findings (Fig. 14.14), these differences are
not yet robust enough to be diagnostic. In some rarer
forms of dementia, genetic testing may be useful (Huntington’s disease and early onset Alzheimer’s (see
Ch. 25)). If the diagnosis is in doubt or atypical, a more
detailed cognitive assessment by a neuropsychologist
may be of benefit (usually accessed via a ‘memory clinic’).

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mr DD first presented with memory loss for recent
events. His personality gradually changed (withdrawn,
prone to verbal aggression) and he also developed
numerous other cognitive deficits: aphasia (rambling
incoherently), agnosia (unable to recognize his pipe),
apraxia (unable to dress himself) and impaired executive functioning (unable to make a cup of coffee). This
6-year deterioration in cognitive and functional abilities

114

associated with a normal level of consciousness gives
the diagnosis of dementia.
Mr DD then developed a delirium as evidenced by
the rapid onset of a fluctuating consciousness level, disturbed sleep–wake cycle, psychomotor agitation and
apparent perceptual disturbances (visual hallucinations). It is crucial that the cause of the delirium is diagnosed and treated. In this case, it could be pneumonia
as Mr DD had developed a productive cough.
Now go on to Chapter 25 to read about delirium and
dementia and their management.

The patient with alcohol
or substance use problems

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The definitions of a ‘substance use disorder’ and a ‘substance-induced disorder’
• The different types of substance use disorders
• The different types of substance-induced disorders
• The differential diagnosis of substance-induced psychiatric disorders
• How to assess a patient with substance use or substance-induced problems

Case summary
Mr AD, aged 42 years, presented to his general
practitioner (GP) smelling of alcohol and complaining
of depression, anxiety, marital problems and
impotence. He admitted drinking heavily – up to a
bottle and a half of whisky per day. He reported
drinking increasing amounts over the past year as
the same amount no longer gave him the same feeling
of well-being. Recently, he noticed that he had to drink
in order to avoid shaking, sweating, vomiting and
feeling ‘on edge’. These symptoms meant having to
take two glasses of whisky before breakfast, just to
feel better. Mr AD admitted that he had neglected his
family and work because of his drinking. Whereas in
the past, he would vary what and when he drank,
he now tended to drink exactly the same thing at the
same time each day, irrespective of his mood or the
occasion. He continued to drink although he knew it
was harming his liver. He was also concerned about
his mental health because, on more than one occasion,
he thought he saw an elderly lady, about the same
height as the kitchen kettle, walking around the room.
Mr AD had no previous psychiatric history or family
history of psychiatric illness and was not taking any
medication.

(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

Psychoactive substances have been used for centuries, and their use is seen in some cultures as entirely acceptable. However, it is important to recognize that
psychoactive substances affect specific parts of the brain,

© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00015-1

which can lead to a range of subjective feelings or behavioural changes. Fortunately, in most cases, these effects
are innocuous; however, psychoactive substances may
cause symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from
psychiatric disorders.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
The term ‘psychoactive’ refers to any substance that has
an effect on the central nervous system. This includes
drugs of abuse, alcohol, nicotine, prescribed or overthe-counter medication and poisons or toxins.
This section will introduce five new concepts specifically in relation to psychoactive substance use: hazardous use, harmful use, dependence, intoxication and
withdrawal. Figure 15.1 provides an overview of these,
and some other substance-related disorders.

Harmful use of substance
Harmful use of a substance is defined as a quantity or
pattern of substance use that actually causes adverse
consequences, without dependence. It may result in difficulties within interpersonal relationships (e.g. domestic violence, impotence); problems meeting work or
educational obligations (e.g. absenteeism); behaviours
that have impact on physical health or safety (e.g. drinking in spite of liver disease, drink-driving); or legal difficulties (e.g. arrest for disorderly conduct, stealing to
fund habit). This can be remembered using the ‘4 L’s’
(love, livelihood, liver, law).
Hazardous use of a substance is defined as a quantity
or pattern of substance use that places the user at risk of
adverse consequences, without dependence.

delirium if severe)

• Substance withdrawal
• Substance withdrawal delirium (including delirium
tremens)

• Substance-related cognitive disorders
• Substance-related psychotic disorder
• Substance-related mood disorder
• Substance-related anxiety disorder

HINTS AND TIPS
Patients are physiologically dependent on a
psychoactive substance when they exhibit signs of
tolerance and/or withdrawal.

Substance intoxication
COMMUNICATION
Remember the ‘four L’s’ (love, livelihood, liver, law)
as a framework for assessing harm arising from
substance use.

Substance dependence
HINTS AND TIPS
The confusion regarding use of the term ‘addiction’ led
the World Health Organization (1964) to recommend
that the term be abandoned in scientific literature in
favour of the term ‘dependence’.

Substance dependence describes a syndrome that incorporates physiological, psychological and behavioural elements. If patients exhibit either tolerance
or withdrawal, they may be specified as having physiological dependence. However, it is important to note
that patients can meet the criteria for the dependence
syndrome without having developed tolerance or
withdrawal. The dependence syndrome (ICD-10 criteria) is diagnosed if three or more of the following
have been present together at some time during the
previous year:
1. A strong desire or compulsion to take the substance.
2. Difficulties in controlling substance-taking behaviour (onset, termination, levels of use).
3. Physiological withdrawal state when substance
use has reduced or ceased; or continued use of
the substance to relieve or avoid withdrawal
symptoms.
4. Signs of tolerance: increased quantities of substance
are required to produce the same effect originally
produced by lower doses.

116

Substance intoxication describes a transient, substancespecific condition that occurs following the use of a
psychoactive substance. Symptoms can include disturbances of consciousness, perception, mood, behaviour
and physiological functions. Severity of intoxication is
normally proportional to dose or levels.

Substance withdrawal
Substance withdrawal describes a substance-specific
syndrome that occurs on reduction or cessation of a psychoactive substance that has usually been used repeatedly, in high doses, for a prolonged period. It is one
of the criteria of the dependence syndrome.

ALCOHOL-RELATED DISORDERS
Many people who drink alcohol come to no harm. Indeed, drinking small quantities of alcohol is thought to
be linked to many health benefits. Therefore, sensible
and modest use of alcohol is not considered to be pathological. Figure 15.2 describes how to calculate the daily
intake of alcohol in units and the recommended safe
intake limits.

Harmful use of alcohol
Harmful use is defined earlier in the chapter, on
page 115. In relation to alcohol, this category is used
when drinking causes secondary physical, psychological
or social harm to the patient or others around them.
People who harmfully drink are not dependent on alcohol: if features of dependence are present, the patient has
alcohol dependence syndrome (see below). Figure 15.3
lists the adverse physical, psychological and social consequences of drinking.

1⁄ 2 pint of beer

(3.5% ABV)
or
1 small glass of wine
(125ml)
(8% ABV)
or
1 measure of spirits

(40% ABV)

Note:
This is an approximate
guide only, as many beers
contain 4–6% ABV and
many wines 11–15% ABV
ABV – alcohol content
by volume

You can calculate units by multiplying alcohol by
volume (in%) with volume (in litres),
e.g. ABV x vol = units
For instance, a pint (568 ml) of 5.3% ABV continental
lager would contain 5.3 x 0.568 = 3 units

Safe daily alcohol limits
Men: 3–4 units/day (<21 units/week)
Women: 2–3 units/day (<14 units/week)
Note: Alcohol can confer health benefit mainly by
giving protection from coronary heart disease, but this
only applies to men over 40 and postmenopausal
women. The maximum health advantages are obtained
by drinking 1–2 units per day.

COMMUNICATION
It is frequently useful to explain that although a patient
may not be suffering from alcohol dependence, they
could be drinking at harmful levels, and might benefit
from an alcohol treatment programme.

a heterogeneous collection of symptoms, signs and behaviours which are determined by biological, psychological and socio-cultural factors. There is a range in
the severity of dependence: one dependent drinker
may experience a mild tremor while at work while
another may shake so much after waking that he is
unable to drink a cup of tea in the morning without
spilling it.

Acute intoxication
Ingestion of alcohol results in transient psychological,
behavioural and neurological changes, the severity of
which are roughly correlated to the alcohol concentration in the blood and brain. Initially, this may produce
an enhanced sense of well-being, greater confidence and
relief of anxiety, which may lead to individuals becoming disinhibited, talkative and flirtatious. As blood
levels increase, some drinkers may exhibit inappropriate sexual or aggressive behaviour whereas others might
become sullen and withdrawn, with labile mood and
possibly self-injurious behaviour. As levels rise further,
drinkers can suffer incoordination, slurred speech,
ataxia, amnesia (see later) and impaired reaction times,
and at very high concentrations, a lowered level of consciousness, respiratory depression, coma and death.
HINTS AND TIPS
Extreme alcohol intoxication states can cause lowered
concentration, inability to sustain attention and global
cognitive impairment, and can meet diagnostic criteria
for delirium (see Ch. 14). However, this should not be
confused with delirium tremens, associated with
alcohol withdrawal.

Alcohol intoxication can be a potentially lifethreatening condition due to the risk of respiratory depression, aspiration of vomit, hypoglycaemia, hypothermia and trauma (e.g. head injury, fractures, or blood loss
following accidents or assaults).

Alcohol dependence
After a significant time of heavy, regular drinking, users
may develop dependence. In 1976, Edwards and Gross
formulated a detailed description of alcohol dependence syndrome: a repeated cluster of symptoms and
signs that occur in heavy drinkers (Fig. 15.4). This
was a strong influence on the ICD-10 substance dependence syndrome (see earlier in chapter), hence their
similarities. It is important to note that alcohol dependence does not just mean physical dependence (although that is an important part of it), but describes

Alcohol withdrawal (including
delirium)
The development of withdrawal symptoms is part of the
dependence syndrome. Figure 15.5 summarizes the
continuum of clinical features of alcohol withdrawal,
from uncomplicated withdrawal to life-threatening delirium tremens (‘the DTs’). However, ‘uncomplicated’
does not mean not serious. All withdrawal states
are potentially life-threatening, as they are associated

description of a clinical syndrome. British Medical Journal 1:1058–1061)

Alcohol dependence syndrome (adapted from Edwards & Gross 1976)
1. Narrowing of repertoire. The range of cues, internal and external, that affect drinking in a normal person influence
the pattern of drinking in a dependent person less and less, i.e. drinking becomes increasingly stereotyped. The
dependent person will drink the same type of alcohol at the same time each day in the same place.
2. Increased salience of drinking. Maintaining the stereotyped pattern of drinking is given priority over other aspects of
the patient’s life such as home and family life, career and previously enjoyed recreational activities.
3. Increased tolerance to alcohol. Increased quantities of alcohol are required to produce the same effect. Patients are
able to tolerate blood alcohol levels that would incapacitate non-tolerant drinkers. Note that tolerance to
alcohol can sometimes decrease considerably in patients who have been drinking heavily for many years.
4. Withdrawal symptoms. A fall in blood alcohol level results in withdrawal symptoms. This will occur when drinkers
reduce or stop their alcohol intake. Heavier degrees of dependence may result in early morning withdrawal
symptoms after a night’s sleep. Withdrawal symptoms include tremors (shakes), nausea and vomiting, sweating and
mood disturbances (anxiety, depression, agitation).
5. Relief or avoidance of withdrawal symptoms by further drinking. Dependent drinkers may need to nip off to the
pub at midday, or worse, have a stiff drink in the morning or, worse still, have a drink in the middle of the night to
fend off incipient withdrawal.
6. Subjective awareness of the compulsion to drink. Patients sometimes describe this highly subjective symptom as a
‘compulsive craving’ that is extremely difficult to resist
7. Rapid reinstatement after abstinence. Although the dependence syndrome may take many years of heavy drinking
to develop, many drinkers may rapidly redevelop dependence when they start drinking again after a significant
period of abstinence. For example, within 3 days a drinker might develop severe withdrawal symptoms, and be able
to tolerate vast quantities of alcohol despite 2 previous years of abstinence.

Fig. 15.5 Clinical features of alcohol withdrawal

Uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal syndrome
• Symptoms develop 4–12 hours after drinking cessation
• Tremulousness (‘the shakes’)
• Sweating
• Nausea and vomiting
• Mood disturbance (anxiety, depression, ‘feeling edgy’)
• Sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis)
• Autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, pyrexia)
• Sleep disturbance
• Psychomotor agitation
With perceptual disturbances
• Illusions or hallucinations (typically visual, auditory, or tactile)
With withdrawal seizures
• Develop 6–48 hours after drinking cessation
• Occurs in 5–15% of all alcohol-dependant drinkers
• Generalized and tonic–clonic
• Predisposing factors: previous history of withdrawal fits, concurrent epilepsy, low potassium or magnesium
Withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens)
• Develops 1–7 days after drinking cessation, mean 48 hours
• Altered consciousness and marked cognitive impairment (i.e. delirium – see Ch. 14 and 25)
• Vivid hallucinations and illusions in any sensory modality (patients often interact or are horrified by them; Lilliputian
visual hallucinations, miniature humans/animals; formication, sensation of insects crawling on the skin)
• Marked tremor
• Autonomic arousal (heavy sweating, raised pulse and blood pressure, fever)
• Paranoid delusions (often associated with intense fear)
• Mortality: 5–15% from cardiovascular collapse, hypo-/hyperthermia, infection
• Predisposing factors: physical illness (hepatitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia)

with autonomic hyperactivity, can include perceptual
disturbances and seizures, and might herald the onset
of a delirium.
COMMUNICATION
Always check whether previous episodes of alcohol
withdrawal have been complicated by medical
problems (such as delirium tremens) or psychiatric
problems (such as suicidality). These points will be
important in determining where detoxification takes
place.

Alcohol-related cognitive
disorders
Blackouts
Episodes of anterograde amnesia (‘blackouts’) can occur
during acute alcohol intoxication. Memory loss may be
patchy, or for a discrete block of time during which
nothing can be remembered. Blackouts are common
and have been experienced by two-thirds of dependent
drinkers and one-third of young men in the general
population. Blackouts refer to amnesia, not collapsing
or ‘passing out’ at the end of the night.

Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome
Both Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Korsakoff’s psychosis occur because of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Although the two disorders were initially
described separately it is now clear they represent a continuum, with Wernicke’s encephalopathy occurring
during acute brain damage due to thiamine deficiency
and Korsakoff’s being the chronic state that emerges after
Wernicke’s. Any disorder that is associated with low thiamine can cause Wernicke–Korsakoff’s syndrome, but
heavy drinkers are at particular risk of this nutritional
deficiency because of their poor dietary intake.
Wernicke’s encephalopathy is characterized by the classical clinical triad of delirium, ophthalmoplegia (mainly
nystagmus, sixth nerve palsy or conjugate gaze palsy),
and ataxia (which can be impossible to distinguish from
intoxication). Prompt treatment with parenteral thiamine
(Pabrinex®) can reduce the likelihood of progression to
Korsakoff’s psychosis, characterized by extensive anterograde and retrograde amnesia, frontal lobe dysfunction
and psychotic symptoms occurring in the absence of delirium. See page 154 for more details of treatment.

Dementia
Long-term alcohol misuse can lead to impairment of
memory, learning, visuospatial skills and impulse

119

The patient with alcohol or substance use problems
control associated with cortical atrophy and ventricular
enlargement. However, it is difficult to separate the toxic
effects of alcohol from the brain damage caused by years
of poor nutrition, trauma (e.g. head injury) and comorbid physical illness (e.g. alcoholic liver disease). Subsequent abstinence from alcohol does lead to some
improvement in cognitive functioning. See Chapters 14
and 25 for more on dementia.

Alcohol-related psychotic
disorder
The interplay between alcohol excess and psychotic
symptoms is complex, and is not as simple as ‘cause
and effect’. While both hallucinations and delusions
can occur in the context of heavy alcohol consumption,
it is important to remember that alcohol misuse is a
common comorbidity in many patients who suffer from
disorders associated with psychotic symptoms (e.g.
schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder), and is also
strongly associated with overvalued ideas or delusions
of infidelity (morbid jealousy, or ‘Othello syndrome’ –
see figure 9.2 on p. 69). However, drinkers may experience psychotic symptoms that resolve completely with
abstinence from alcohol. These can range from fleeting
perceptual disturbances with retained insight, to more
persistent predominantly auditory or visual hallucinations (alcoholic hallucinosis), to persecutory or grandiose delusions. These are distinguished from acute
intoxication or alcohol withdrawal delirium by the
absence of cognitive impairment and by clarifying when
someone last had a drink.

Alcohol-related mood disorder
Again, the relationship between alcohol and depression is complex. Heavy alcohol consumption may
cause low mood, and similarly low mood may cause
sufferers to drink heavily to ‘escape’ their difficulties.
This problem is often compounded by the social
damage that alcohol can have on patients’ personal
lives (relationships, marriage, employment, finances,
physical ill health, criminality, etc.). Differentiating
low mood secondary to alcohol and true depressive
disorder is very difficult, and usually starts with abstinence (following detoxification if necessary). Because
of the potent psychoactive effects of alcohol, pharmacological treatment of depression with antidepressants in a patient who continues to drink heavily
is much less likely to be successful than if they
remained abstinent.
Problematic drinking is often a consequence of mania (either ‘self-medication’ or due to disinhibition).
However, excessive alcohol can be associated with precipitation or relapse of manic illnesses in sufferers of
bipolar affective disorder.

120

Alcohol-related anxiety disorder
Up to a third of drinkers have significant anxiety symptoms. As in depression, establishing whether alcohol is a
cause or a consequence of anxiety disorders is difficult.
The anxiolytic properties of alcohol often result in attempts at self-medication in patients with agoraphobia
and social phobia, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms
can mimic anxiety and panic symptoms. Whatever the
direction of the relationship, reducing alcohol consumption is likely to be of benefit.
HINTS AND TIPS
While self-harm and suicide are not discrete mental
disorders, they are strongly associated with alcohol
misuse. A disproportionately high number of patients
who present to hospital after harming themselves are
intoxicated, or have a history of heavy drinking. The
lifetime risk of suicide in problem drinkers is 3–4%,
which is 60–120 times greater than the normal
population. This may be due to development of the
alcohol-related psychiatric disorders (mainly low
mood), the fact that alcohol misuse is often comorbid
with many psychiatric illnesses and personality
disorders, or through impaired judgement or
disinhibition secondary to alcohol.

OTHER SUBSTANCE-RELATED
DISORDERS
It is beyond the scope of this book to describe the individual psychiatric consequences of every illicit drug in
detail. However, like alcohol, other substance-related
disorders are classified as substance use disorders or
substance-induced disorders (see Figure 15.1). Common illicit drugs are described in Figure 15.6.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Patients using psychoactive substances can present with
features similar to primary psychiatric disorder, posing a
diagnostic challenge. The relationship between substance use and psychiatric symptoms can be reduced
to three diagnostic possibilities:
1. There is a primary psychiatric disorder (e.g. depression or schizophrenia) and the patient is coincidentally using drugs or alcohol (remember that patients
suffering from mental illness often use psychoactive
substances to obtain relief from their symptoms).

ASSESSMENT

History
The CAGE and AUDIT questionnaires (see below) can
be helpful in screening for alcohol dependence.

121

The patient with alcohol or substance use problems
A thorough clinical history should pay particular attention to all substances used, the pattern of use, features of
dependence, and consequences of substance use (relationships, employment, physical health, criminality).
Past history of psychiatric illness and substance misuse,
as well as family history of substance misuse should be
explored. Mental state examination is important to establish psychiatric comorbidity or sequelae, current suicidality, and insight into current substance misuse (e.g.
whether the patient considers it to be a problem and
what they would consider to be helpful).
The CAGE questionnaire is a simple tool to screen for
alcohol dependence. If patients answer yes to two or
more questions, regard the screen as positive and go
on to check if they meet criteria for the alcohol dependence syndrome:
1. Have you ever felt you ought to Cut down on your
drinking?
2. Have people ever Annoyed you by criticizing your
drinking?
3. Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?
4. Have you ever needed an ‘Eye-opener’ (a drink first
thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid
of a hangover)?
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
is a 10-item screening questionnaire for problem drinking. It takes 3 minutes to complete and score, and is being used increasingly in many segments of healthcare.

Examination
The physical examination requires an awareness of both
the acute and chronic effects of alcohol or substance use
and should focus on:
• Evidence of acute use or intoxication (e.g. pupil constriction with opiate use; incoordination and slurred
speech with alcohol use).
• Signs of withdrawal (e.g. tremulousness, sweating,
nausea and vomiting, tachycardia and pupil dilatation with alcohol withdrawal).
• Immediate and short-term medical complications of
substance use (e.g. head injury following alcohol intoxication, infection caused by intravenous drug use).
• Long-term medical complications (e.g. alcoholrelated liver disease, hepatitis B or C or HIV infection
with intravenous drug use).

Investigations
There is no investigation that is absolutely indicative of
substance dependence. A urine or saliva drug-screening
test is essential whenever the use of psychoactive substances is suspected, but this is only able to detect a

122

limited number of well-known drugs (not drugs which
are new to the market). Breath alcohol level (via a breathalyser) only detects recent alcohol use; however, a high
reading in the absence of signs of intoxication suggests
some degree of tolerance, which is likely to be indicative
of chronic heavy drinking.
Investigations are also useful to identify possible longer term complications of alcohol (see Fig. 15.3) and include a full blood count (mean corpuscular volume, or
MCV, may be elevated), urea and electrolytes, liver function tests (gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gGT) may
be raised; elevated aminotransferases (ALT or AST) indicate liver injury), clotting screen (prolonged prothrombin time is a sensitive marker of liver function) and
electrocardiogram (ECG).
If the patient has injected drugs consider hepatitis serology and an HIV test; however, ensure that patients are
appropriately counselled and provide informed consent. If the patient is suffering from a withdrawal delirium, brain imaging may be necessary to exclude an
additional complication (e.g. infection, head injury,
brain abscess).

COMMUNICATION
All patients, especially young psychotic patients who
are suspected of having a substance-induced
psychiatric disorder, should have a urine or saliva
drug-screening test. It is important to collect the urine
as soon as possible because the half-lives of some drugs
are short.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
Mr AD has an alcohol dependence syndrome as evidenced by his tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, relief
of withdrawal by drinking, salience of drinking, narrowing of repertoire and also continued drinking despite
awareness of harmful consequences. He has physical
(sexual, possibly other systems), social (marital disharmony, neglect of family and work) and psychological
(depression, anxiety, hallucinations) complications of
his alcohol use. Apart from treating the alcohol dependence, it is important to ensure that his depression, anxiety and hallucinations are not indicative of a primary
psychiatric disorder. The visual hallucinations may be
suggestive of a withdrawal syndrome or be one of the
perceptual disturbances sometimes caused by heavy alcohol use.

and substance disorders and their management.

After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The definitions of ‘personality trait’ and ‘personality disorder’
• The different types of personality disorder
• Different approaches to classifying personality problems
• The differential diagnosis of personality disorders
• How to assess a patient presenting with a potential personality disorder

Case summary
The on-call psychiatrist was asked to assess Miss BP, a
27-year-old woman who had been known to mental
health services since the age of 17 with symptoms that
had been fairly consistent. She lived with her mother,
who had contacted services because Miss BP was
threatening to jump in front of a bus. Her father had
sexually abused her as a child, and she had a long
history of self-harm that included self-inflicted cuts
and repeated overdoses. Her mother was inclined to
challenge her promiscuous behaviour and binge
drinking, which led to many heated arguments.
At interview, Miss BP told the psychiatrist that she was
feeling ‘more depressed than ever’ because her mother
had suggested that she move into her own house. With
gentle questioning, it transpired that she was afraid
that her mother would stop caring for her if she moved
out. The psychiatrist, who had known Miss BP for
years, recognized that this behaviour was not unusual
for her and was able to help her to see another
perspective to her mother’s suggestion. Miss BP’s
mood quickly lifted and her suicidal ideation resolved.

(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

People use the term ‘personality’ with varying meanings, even within the psychological and psychiatric specialties. Amid the lack of consensus on what defines
personality, there is little doubt that some people seem
to experience, and interact with, the world in a manner
markedly different to other individuals in their culture.
The description and management of what has been arbitrarily designated ‘personality disorder’ is one of the

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00016-3

most controversial subjects in psychiatry. Not only are
personality disorders associated with significant distress
to the sufferer, but they are also associated with great
cost to healthcare, social and criminal justice agencies.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
The DSM-IV defines personality traits as enduring patterns of perceiving, thinking about, and relating to both
self and the environment, exhibited in a wide range of
social and personal contexts. It is only when an individual has traits that are persistently inflexible and maladaptive, stable over time, and which cause significant
personal distress or functional impairment that a personality disorder is said to exist.
Patients with personality disorder tend not to regard
their patterns of behaviour as inherently abnormal.
Instead, they usually present to healthcare services with
a wide range of problems related or consequent to their
abnormal personality traits (e.g. self-harm, feelings of
depression or anxiety, violence or disorderly conduct,
post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, dissociative or somatoform disorders). Having a major
psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia does not preclude patients from also having personality disorder.
HINTS AND TIPS
The DSM-IV separates Axis II conditions (e.g.
personality disorders) from Axis I conditions (e.g.
schizophrenia, affective disorders) so that both are
considered when diagnosing a patient.

123

The patient with personality problems

CLASSIFICATION
The personality disorders can be classified into two
groups according to their aetiology. The first group includes ‘acquired’ personality disorders where the disorder clearly develops after, and is directly related to, a
recognizable ‘insult’. Organic personality disorder results
when this ‘insult’ is some form of brain damage or disease (e.g. a brain tumour or stroke). A common example
is seen in patients with frontal lobe lesions, which can
be characterized by social disinhibition (e.g. stealing,
sexual inappropriateness) and abnormalities of emotional expression (e.g. shallow cheerfulness, aggression,
apathy). Patients can also develop enduring personality
changes after experiencing a catastrophic event (e.g.
concentration camp or hostage situation) or after the
development of a severe psychiatric illness.
The second group includes what is referred to in the
ICD-10 as the specific personality disorders (these are far
more prevalent and therefore simply referred to as the
‘personality disorders’ – as will be done for the rest of
this chapter). In this group of personality disorders, it
is difficult to find a direct causal relationship between
personality traits and any one specific insult, although
genetic and environmental factors have been implicated
(see Ch. 22). The specific personality disorders usually
have their onset in adolescence or early adulthood,
and any change in symptoms tends to occur very gradually over long periods of time.
Personality disorders can be further classified according to clinical presentation, specifically which particular
maladaptive personality traits are present. In this regard,
there are two approaches: the dimensional and categorical
classifications:
The dimensional approach hypothesizes that the personality traits of patients with personality disorder differ
from the normal population only in terms of degree.
Maladaptive personality traits can therefore be seen as
existing on a continuum that merges into normality.
The dimensional approach is used predominantly in
the research of personality disorders and is measured
by personality inventories (e.g. Minnesota Multiphasic
Personality Inventory – MMPI).
The ICD-10 and DSM-IV use the categorical approach,
which assumes the existence of distinct types of personality disorder and therefore classifies patients into discrete categories as summarized in Figure 16.1. Despite
the widespread use of the categorical approach in clinical practice, it seldom conforms to reality as there is
considerable overlap of traits and most individuals do
not fit perfectly into these described categories.
In an attempt to further simplify the classification of
personality disorders, the DSM-IV has designated three personality clusters based on general similarities. Cluster A
describes individuals who appear odd or eccentric, and

124

includes paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal personality
disorders. Cluster B describes individuals who appear dramatic, emotional or erratic, and includes borderline, antisocial (dissocial), histrionic and narcissistic personality
disorders. Cluster C describes individuals who appear anxious or fearful, and includes avoidant, dependent and
obsessive-compulsive (anankastic) personality disorders.
COMMUNICATION
Everybody has a personality that, no matter how
‘normal’, can have dysfunctional traits (e.g. anger,
anxiety, idealization/devaluation, obsessivecompulsive behaviour). These traits often become
much more prominent at times of psychological stress,
such as mental or physical illness, pain and discomfort,
work-related stress, and even tiredness and hunger. It
is important to remember that personality disorders
occur in many settings, remain stable over time, and
cause significant personal distress or functional
impairment.

HINTS AND TIPS
The term ‘borderline personality disorder’ is derived
from the early 20th century psychoanalysts, who
described a group of patients who stood ‘on the
borderline’ between the neuroses and the psychoses.

ASSESSMENT

History
As with other mental illnesses, giving a patient a label
of personality disorder gives those involved with their
care only a limited amount of information. In fact,
the clinical classification of personality disorders is often unreliable and although psychiatrists usually agree
that a patient has a personality disorder, there are often
differing points of view as regards the subtype of the disorder. Patients with possible personality disorder often
present at times of crisis and distress, and therefore diagnosis at first interview can be difficult, because of the
quantity of background and collateral information required and because diagnosis requires the features to
persist over time.
A practical approach includes making a comprehensive assessment of:
• Sources of distress (thoughts, emotions, behaviour
and relationships) to self and others.

16

criticism
Eccentric behaviour; odd beliefs or magical thinking; unusual perceptual
experiences (e.g. ‘sensing’ another’s presence); ideas of reference; suspicious or
paranoid ideas; vague or circumstantial thinking; social withdrawal

assume responsibility for major life areas; fear of separation
Hypersensitivity to critical remarks or rejection; inhibited in social situations;
fears of inadequacy
Preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism and control; devoted to work at
expense of leisure; pedantic, rigid and stubborn; overly cautious

Note that the ICD-10 includes all the personality disorders described in the DSM-IV clusters above, except for schizotypal and narcissistic
personality disorder. However, schizotypal disorder (similar to the DSM-IV’s schizotypal personality disorder) is included in the ICD-10’s
section on psychotic disorders.

• Any comorbid mental illness.
• Specific impairments of functioning at work, home
or in social circumstances.
It is usually possible to establish some idea of a patient’s
personality by taking a detailed history of their life focusing on the areas of education, work, criminality, relationships and sexual behaviour. When patients are not
able to describe aspects of their personality, it can be
useful to ask how those close to them might describe
them. It is also useful – with consent – to obtain collateral information from the patient’s family, employer
and general practitioner, all of whom might be able
to provide information to help distinguish between
transient and enduring patterns of behaviour.
It is important to recognize that strong emotional reactions may be elicited by patients with personality disorder (transference and countertransference – see
glossary), and that they are often perceived as ‘difficult

patients’ because of this. Being mindful of your own
emotions (often strong feelings of anger or anxiety)
and taking a non-judgemental and empathic stance during assessment can be greatly beneficial, as well as providing insight into the diagnosis itself.
A number of self-rating questionnaires focused on
personality traits are available. These can be helpful in
the diagnosis of personality disorder; however, they
should not be used as a substitute for a comprehensive
clinical history. Structured interviews are also available,
although these tend to be used for research purposes
and are seldom used clinically.

Examination and investigation
There are no specific physical signs that are diagnostic of
personality disorders. However, the consequences of associated behaviours may be seen on examination or

125

The patient with personality problems
investigation, including marks from self-inflicted lacerations or burns, musculoskeletal injuries from assaults
or accidents, the sequelae of drug or alcohol misuse,
sexually transmitted infections following promiscuity,
and so on.

When an individual develops a dramatic personality
change after a period of normal personality functioning,
consider an organic personality disorder or a personality
disorder that occurs secondary to experiencing a
catastrophic event or developing a severe psychiatric
illness.

COMMUNICATION
HINTS AND TIPS

It is difficult to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of
personality disorder without taking a reliable collateral
history to establish pervasiveness and stability of
presentation. It can be difficult for patients to comment
on this objectively, especially if they are in a state of
distress.

Remember that the cluster A personality disorders may
present with features similar to the psychotic disorders
(e.g. suspiciousness, social withdrawal and eccentric
beliefs) but are differentiated by the absence of true
delusions or hallucinations.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY

Almost all the mental illnesses described in this book
can feature some of the behaviours that characterize
the personality disorders. Examples include social withdrawal, suspiciousness and odd ideas in schizophrenia;
self-harm, low mood and poor self-image in depression;
aggression, irresponsibility and impulsivity in substance
abuse or mania. The diagnostic task is also complicated
by the observation that many patients with a major
mental illness also have a concurrent personality disorder. Therefore, you should always consider the possibility of major mental illness (DSM-IV: Axis I) before
diagnosing a personality disorder (DSM-IV: Axis II),
although both can be diagnosed together. A personality
disorder should only be diagnosed when the clinical features
begin in adolescence or early adulthood, are relatively stable
over time and do not only occur during an episode of a major
mental illness (e.g. depressive, manic, psychotic episode).

126

Miss BP has a chronic condition that first presented in
adolescence and has changed little over time. She has
a number of maladaptive and inflexible personality
traits that manifest as repeated self-mutilation, suicidal
behaviour, impulsivity (promiscuity, binge drinking),
fluctuations in mood and a desperate fear of abandonment by her mother. These characteristics are consistent
with a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality
disorder, borderline type. It would be important to exclude another mental illness that may coexist with the
personality disorder, such as depression or harmful
use/dependence on alcohol. Note that there is an association between borderline personality disorder and
childhood trauma, including physical, emotional and
sexual abuse.
Now go on to Chapter 22 to read about the personality disorders and their management.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The definitions of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa
• The psychopathological symptoms of eating disorders
• The physical symptoms and complications of eating disorders
• The differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with low weight

Case summary
Miss ED, a 19-year-old law student, eventually agreed
to see a psychiatrist after much persuasion from her
mother and general practitioner (GP). Her weight had
fallen from 65 kg to 41 kg over the previous 6 months
and she appeared emaciated. Her GP had measured
her height at 1.65 metres and had calculated her body
mass index (BMI) to be 15 kg/m2. The psychiatrist saw
Miss ED alone and spent some time putting her at ease.
After an initial reluctance, she admitted that she was
repulsed by the thought of being fat and felt that she
was still overweight and needed to lose ‘just a few more
pounds’. She had stopped menstruating 4 months ago
and had also noted that she was feeling tired and cold
all the time and was finding it difficult to concentrate.
The psychiatrist elicited that she only ate one small
meal a day and was exercising to the point of almost
collapsing. She denied binge eating or self-induced
vomiting but did admit to using 20 senna tablets daily.
She reported symptoms of depression, but no suicidal
ideation. Physical examination revealed a pulse rate of
50 beats per minute and fine downy hair covering
her torso.
(For a discussion of the case study
see the end of the chapter)

Many people are concerned about what they eat and
how this affects their body weight and shape. However,
some individuals become morbidly concerned with
their body image to the point that their life revolves
around the relentless pursuit of thinness. This lifethreatening form of psychopathology needs to be
distinguished from other physical, psychiatric, or
substance-associated causes of weight loss.

DEFINITIONS AND CLINICAL
FEATURES
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are two psychiatric
disorders characterized by conscious and deliberate
efforts to reduce body weight. There are similarities
between the psychopathology of the disorders: a preoccupation with food and being thin, and overvalued
ideas involving a dread of fatness and a distorted sense
of body shape and weight.

Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia is characterized by overvalued ideas concerning body shape and weight, preoccupation with being
thin and intrusive dread of fatness. As a result, a selfimposed low body weight is maintained at least 15%
below what is expected for age and height. In adults,
the body mass index (BMI: Fig. 17.1) is 17.5 kg/m2 or
less (in children and adolescents, growth charts should
be consulted). There is also generalized endocrine
disturbance of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal
axis, as evidenced by amenorrhoea in post-menarchal
women; loss of sexual interest and impotency in men;
raised growth hormone and cortisol; and reduced T3.
In pre-pubertal sufferers of anorexia, expected weight
gain during the growth period is impaired and pubertal
events (menarche, breast and genital development) may
be delayed or arrested. While not always present, selfinduced purging, excessive exercise and use of appetite
suppressants or diuretics are often used to enhance
weight loss.

Bulimia nervosa
In bulimia nervosa, patients usually have a normal body
weight (or weight may even be increased). In addition
to sharing similar overvalued ideas with anorexia

1. Low body weight: 15% below expected

2. Self-induced weight loss (poor caloric intake,

3. Overvalued idea: dread of fatness, self-perception of
being too fat; low target weight
4. Endocrine disturbance (hypothalamic–pituitary–

nervosa, bulimia nervosa is characterized by a preoccupation with eating and an irresistible craving for food
that results in binge eating. This is associated with a
sense of lack of control, and is invariably followed by
feelings of shame and disgust. To counteract this caloric
load, patients engage in purging (self-induced vomiting,
laxative and diuretic use), fasting or excessive exercise,
but can employ any number of ingenious, even dangerous, strategies (e.g. misuse of thyroid drugs, diabetic
patients refusing to administer insulin).
Figure 17.2 summarizes the ICD-10 criteria for
anorexia and bulimia nervosa.
HINTS AND TIPS
Some patients with anorexia nervosa may also engage
in binge eating and purging behaviour, which is
characteristic of bulimia nervosa. This does not preclude
the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa; the DSM-IV terms
this ‘anorexia nervosa, binge eating/purging type’.
The key diagnostic difference is that patients with
anorexia nervosa are significantly underweight and
have generalized endocrine abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

History
It is important to define the extent of the eating disorder, yet at the same time not alienate a patient who
might be ambivalent about treatment. Focusing initially
on the patient’s life history, premorbid personality,
social circumstances, family, friendships, relationships
and functionality can aid engagement and build
rapport. These factors can also be very relevant to the
aetiology of the disorder, and useful in determining

128

Bulimia nervosa, all of the following:
1. Binge eating
2. Strong cravings for food
3. Methods to counteract weight gain (vomiting,
laxatives, fasting, exercise, etc.)
4. Overvalued idea: dread of fatness; self-perception of
being too fat; low target weight

appropriate treatment (see Ch. 23). Later in the interview, it is important to focus on weight and eating.
Remember that direct questions may lead to confrontation and denial, and a technique that can be helpful
to avoid alienating the patient is to ‘normalize’ symptoms for the purposes of the interview. The following
questions may be useful:

Anorexic symptoms
• Body weight and shape can be very important to
some people. Do you find that you are quite concerned about your weight?
• A common way of losing weight is to eat less or to
exercise a lot. Are these things that you do?
• Sometimes when women lose weight, their periods
can become irregular or stop. Has this happened
to you?

Bulimic symptoms
• Often when people try to lose weight they have
episodes when their eating seems excessive or out
of control. Has this ever happened to you?
• After eating a lot, some people can feel guilty and uncomfortable, and can vomit to make themselves feel
better. Is this something that you have ever done?
• Sometimes people might use pharmaceutical or
street drugs to help control their weight. Have you
ever tried this?

Other psychiatric symptoms
Sufferers of eating disorders may report other psychiatric symptoms. Anxiety classically surrounds eating, but
may appear more generalized. If symptoms are

Differential diagnosis of patients with low weight
sufficiently severe to be disorders in their own right,
then a comorbid psychiatric illness may be present. Distinguishing depression from anorexia is discussed below (under differential diagnosis).

Physical symptoms
Eating disorders are associated with a number of
physical sequelae, and therefore a thorough medical
history is required. Physical complications are listed
in Figure 17.3. Important factors to ascertain include
a menstrual history, episodes of syncope or presyncope,
palpitations, tiredness, muscle weakness and sensitivity
to cold.

Examination
Both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa cause medical sequelae, and the importance of physical examination cannot be overstated. Patients may be reluctant to
be examined; however, this can be facilitated when preceded by a clinical interview in which good rapport is

• Skin –‘lanugo’ hair (fine, downy hair on body); loss
of head hair; calluses on knuckles (from self-induced
vomiting: Russell’s sign).
• Dentition – abrasions; tooth decay.
• Cardiovascular – lying and standing blood pressure

pulse.
• Abdomen – constipation.
• Musculoskeletal – muscle wasting; ability to rise from
a squat without using hands; pathological fractures.
• Other – core temperature; mucous membranes (dehydration); facial glands (swollen parotid glands
may suggest frequent vomiting).

Investigations
Numerous biochemical and metabolic changes are associated with being underweight and engaging in excessive purging as summarized in Figure 17.3. These
complications may be associated with long-term complications or result in sudden death. Investigations
should therefore include: electrocardiography (ECG),
urea and electrolytes, full blood count, liver function
tests, serum glucose and lipids, thyroid function tests
and amylase. Changes in hormone levels (cortisol,
insulin, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, growth hormone) have been described, but these
are of limited diagnostic value and are not routinely
measured. Bone density (DXA) scanning may be considered for identification of osteopenia and osteoporosis.

establish diagnosis in patients with a suspected eating
disorder.
HINTS AND TIPS
Hypokalaemia is a life-threatening complication that can
result from repeated vomiting, as well as laxative and
diuretic abuse. Gradual correction is safer than rapid
correction, so advise patients to eat high potassium foods
(e.g. bananas) or use potassium supplements. Severe
hypokalaemia is an indication for hospitalization.

It is very important to exclude physical causes of
weight loss, including malignancies, gastrointestinal disease, endocrine diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism), chronic infections and chronic inflammatory
conditions. Note that rare neurological syndromes associated with gross overeating include the Kleine–Levin,
Klüver–Bucy and Prader–Willi syndromes.

130

Severe weight loss may occur in depression, but this is
usually associated with a marked loss of appetite and interest in food. Patients with anorexia maintain their appetite until late in the disease and remain interested
in food-related subjects (e.g. low-calorie recipes). Note
that patients with anorexia and bulimia often have
comorbid depression and that depressive symptoms

HINTS AND TIPS
In the differential diagnosis of weight loss, anorexia and
bulimia nervosa are closely associated with the
overvalued idea of dread of fatness. Weight loss
occurring in depression results from loss of appetite and
lack of interest and enjoyment in food.

DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY
may be secondary to the biological consequences of
starvation and thus resolve with subsequent weight gain.
Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder may
lose weight when time-consuming compulsions prevent
an adequate diet. Also, obsessions of contamination of
food might curtail their caloric intake. As with depression, the issue is clouded by the observation that
patients with anorexia nervosa have an increased incidence of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which should
only be diagnosed when obsessions or compulsions
are unrelated to food or body shape.
Psychotic patients may not eat due to delusions about
food or hallucinations commanding them not to. The
negative symptoms of schizophrenia (see p. 70) can also
result in substantial weight loss.
Poor nutrition often occurs in patients with alcohol
or substance abuse and dementia.

Miss ED’s body mass index is 15 kg/m2, which is more
than 15% below what would be expected. She admits to
a dread of fatness and consequently pursues a target
weight significantly below that which is normal or
healthy. Her weight loss methods include poor caloric
intake, excessive exercise and laxative abuse. Dread of
fatness, low body weight and endocrine disturbance
(amenorrhoea) are characteristic of anorexia nervosa.
The absence of binge eating precludes a diagnosis of
bulimia nervosa, but Miss ED does engage in purging
(use of laxatives). The depressive symptoms may signify
a comorbid disorder or be secondary to the biological
effects of malnutrition. Medical complications include
amenorrhoea, lethargy, hypothermia, bradycardia and
lanugo (fine downy hair on torso).
Now go on to Chapter 23 to read about the eating
disorders and their management.

DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS

Epidemiology
Figure 18.1 summarizes the epidemiology of the mood
disorders.

a particular allele of the serotonin transporter gene is associated with an increased risk of depression only in
those who experience adverse life events. People who
have the allele but do not suffer adverse life events do
not experience the increased risk.

Early life experience
Parental separation (e.g. divorce) during childhood increases the risk of depression in adult life. This may
partly relate to the loss of a parent, and partly to the disruption of care to the child. Other types of childhood
adversity (e.g. neglect, physical and sexual abuse) increase the risk of depression and other psychiatric disorders. Postnatal depression in mothers can be associated
with an indifferent early upbringing, leading to poor
self-esteem and increased risk of depression in the child.

Aetiology

Personality

Depression is a multifactorial disorder, with interacting
risk factors from many aspects of a patient’s make-up.
Genetics, early upbringing and personality can increase
vulnerability to depression, with episodes arising
depending on the level of acute and chronic stress experienced (see Fig. 18.2).

Genetics and early upbringing combine to shape personality, so it is unsurprising that some personality features are
associated with increased risk of mood disorder. The personality trait ‘neuroticism’ (anxious, moody, shy, easily
stressed) has consistently been found to increase the risk
of unipolar depression. Certain personality disorders (e.g.
borderline personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder) also increase the risk of depression.

Genetics
Twin studies show the heritability of depression as
40–50%. The genetic risk is likely to be contributed to
by multiple genes of individual small effect. Some genetic influence may only manifest in particular circumstances (gene–environment interactions). For example,

redundancy. The life event may not necessarily be
causal, as being depressed – or at risk of depression –
may also increase the risk of experiencing adverse life
events. In recurrent depression, later episodes are less
likely to be triggered by life events.

Chronic stress
The psychological and physiological effects of chronic
stress may make someone vulnerable to depression
and also reduce their ability to cope with more acute
stressful life events. Chronic stressors such as poor social
support (e.g. lack of someone to confide in), not having
employment outside the home and raising young children are associated with depression. Chronic pain and
any other chronic illness, particularly heart disease
and stroke, are also associated with depression.

Neurobiology
The final common pathway of the multiple aetiological
routes to mood disorder is abnormal brain structure
and function. It is likely that mood disorders are due
to malfunctioning communication between multiple
brain regions involved in emotion regulation, rather
than just one key abnormal area. Recurrent early-onset
depression is associated with reduced volume of the
hippocampus, amygdala and some regions of frontal
cortex. Depression with onset in later life is associated

134

with white matter hyperintensities on neuroimaging,
thought to represent small silent infarctions.
Neurochemically, multiple interacting neurotransmitter pathways are likely to be important. The two
main abnormalities identified in depression are overactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis
and deficiency of monoamines (noradrenaline (norepinephrine), serotonin, dopamine).

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapters 6, 7 and 8.

Management
A biopsychosocial approach is taken to the management
of depression, which means that consideration should
be given to treating biological, psychological and social
aspects of the illness. See Figure 18.3.

Treatment setting
Most patients with depression can be treated successfully in primary care, or in a psychiatric out-patient
clinic. Day-hospital attendance may be helpful in patients with chronic or recurrent illness, especially if poor
motivation or low self-esteem has led to a reluctance to
go outside the home and make contact with others. Inpatient admission may be advisable for assessment of
patients with:
• Highly distressing hallucinations, delusions or other
psychotic phenomena.
• Active suicidal ideation or planning, especially if suicide has previously been attempted or many risk factors for suicide are present (see Ch. 6).
• Lack of motivation leading to extreme self-neglect
(e.g. dehydration or starvation).
Detention under mental health legislation may be necessary for patients who need admission but are unwilling to accept in-patient treatment due to reduced

insight, or lack of capacity to make decisions regarding
their treatment (see Ch. 4).

Lifestyle advice
All patients with low mood should be advised to avoid
alcohol and substance use, eat a healthy diet, exercise
regularly and practice good sleep hygiene (e.g. avoid caffeine and smoking in the evenings, do not sleep during
the day, set regular sleep and wake times, do not use
the bedroom for studying/watching TV). Patients can
be referred to exercise groups; discounts may be
available for those suffering from depression.

HINTS AND TIPS
Patients reluctant to take medication may prefer the
idea of ‘talking therapies’. It is worth noting that
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) can be as effective
as antidepressants in treating moderate depressive
episodes and that when used after medication it can
reduce the rate of relapse up to 4 years later. You may
want to discuss both options with the patient,
encouraging the use of both but allowing the patient to
make the final decision – this often aids concordance.

Psychological treatment

Pharmacological treatment

NICE (2009) recommends that psychological treatments are used first line for mild depression, and in
combination with drug treatments for moderate–severe
depression. The severity of depression is determined in
part by the number of symptoms (see Ch. 7) but mainly
by the degree of functional impairment (i.e. whether
the patient is still able to fulfil their normal social
and occupational roles). Chapter 3 covers psychological treatments in detail. Modalities often used in
depression are:

NICE (2009) recommends antidepressants only for patients with moderate–severe depression or for patients
with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or
mild to moderate depression who have not benefited
from a low-intensity psychosocial intervention. Selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs (e.g. sertraline,
paroxetine, citalopram, fluoxetine), are recommended
by NICE (2009) as first line antidepressants because they
have fewest side-effects. All antidepressants are similarly
effective if prescribed at the correct dose and taken for an
adequate length of time. Clinicians therefore tend to
choose an antidepressant based not upon efficacy,
but upon its side-effect profile (taking into account
patient preference and comorbidity), and on which symptoms of depression are most troublesome. Figure 18.4

The mood (affective) disorders
Fig. 18.4 Choosing an antidepressant

The antidepressants all have a similar efficacy for the
treatment of depression. Therefore, the choice of which
drug to prescribe depends on:
• Their side-effects: SSRIs have a more favourable
side-effect profile over TCAs. Also, side-effects should
be matched to a patient’s lifestyle, e.g. the weight gain
caused by mirtazapine may be preferable to the sexual
dysfunction caused by the SSRIs; some patients
benefit from the sedation caused by some
antidepressants, e.g. amitriptyline, trazodone,
mirtazapine (see Ch. 2)
• Previous good response to a specific drug: this is
usually re-prescribed
• Safety in overdose: SSRIs are safer in overdose than
TCAs and venlafaxine
• For severe depression requiring hospitalization,
antidepressants that affect both noradrenaline
(norepinephrine) and serotonin may be preferable, i.e.
TCAs and high-dose venlafaxine (SSRIs may be slightly
less effective in treating depression of severity
sufficient to cause hospitalization)
• Atypical depression (i.e. hypersomnia, overeating and
anxiety) may respond preferably to MAOIs
• Associated psychiatric symptoms, e.g. patients with
obsessions or compulsions, may respond preferably to
high dose SSRIs or clomipramine
• Concomitant physical illnesses, e.g. TCAs are
contraindicated in patients with a recent myocardial
infarction, or arrhythmias

treatment the following strategies may be employed
(often in this order):
• Reassess the diagnosis: is depression the cause of
their low mood? Are they using alcohol or substances? Do they have a different psychiatric disorder? Is there an ongoing psychosocial stressor?
• Consider psychological therapy, if this is not already
in place.
• Increase the dose of the current antidepressant (e.g.
increasing fluoxetine from 20 mg to 40 mg).
• Change to another SSRI (e.g. from fluoxetine to
sertraline).
• Change to another antidepressant from a different class
(e.g. from sertraline (SSRI) to venlafaxine (SSNRI)).
• Consider augmenting the current antidepressant
with lithium or another antidepressant, e.g. mirtazapine (usually done by a psychiatrist). Antipsychotics
can also be used as augmenting agents in treatmentresistant depression.
• Consider electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) if criteria
met.
• A depressive episode with psychotic features usually
requires the adjunctive use of antipsychotic medication.

HINTS AND TIPS
• Patients may tell you that they have already taken
antidepressants and that they do not work. People
often respond to antidepressants from some classes
but not others, so it can still be worth trialling a
different antidepressant – you may want to explain
this before prescribing.
• Remember that patients are often prescribed
inadequate doses for inadequate lengths of time before
the medication is changed – this does not represent
treatment failure, for which a treatment dose needs to
have been prescribed for 6–8 weeks without a
response. You may find it useful to document dose
and treatment period in your drug history.

SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic
antidepressant; MAOI, monoamine oxidase inhibitor

summarizes some of the factors guiding the choice of an
antidepressant. See Chapter 2 for more information on
antidepressant mechanisms and side-effects.
Antidepressants are most effective in moderate–severe
depression, where around 50% of patients will respond
(compared with 30% on placebo), when prescribed at
an adequate dose for a sufficiently long period (usually
4–6 weeks, longer in older adults), with appropriate
patient education and encouragement. When an antidepressant has brought remission of symptoms, it should
be continued at full dose (i.e. at the dose that induced
the remission) for at least 6 months to reduce the relapse
rate. Patients with a history of recurrent depressive disorder may benefit from taking antidepressants for a
longer period, perhaps even lifelong in severe cases. The
prophylactic effect of antidepressants in reducing
relapse has been demonstrated for at least 5 years (with
imipramine).
Treatment often fails due to inadequate dose of
drug, duration of treatment or poor concordance;
therefore, these factors should always be ruled out.
However, when a patient has not responded to an antidepressant at the correct dose for the correct length of

136

Electroconvulsive therapy
See Chapter 2 for information on the administration
and side-effects of ECT. Indications for ECT in depression include:
•
•
•
•

Poor response to adequate trials of antidepressants.
Intolerance of antidepressants due to side-effects.
Depression with severe suicidal ideation.
Depression with psychotic features, severe psychomotor retardation or stupor.
• Depression with severe self-neglect (poor fluid and
food intake).
• Previous good response to ECT.

18

Bipolar affective disorder

Course and prognosis

Management

Depression is self-limiting, and without treatment a first
depressive episode will generally remit within 6 months
to 1 year. However, the course of depression is often
chronic and relapsing and around 80% of patients have
a further depressive episode, with the risk of future episodes increasing with each relapse.
Depression is one of the most important risk factors
for suicide; rates of suicide are over 20 times greater
in patients with depression compared with those in
the general population.

The main management scenarios are:

BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER

Epidemiology
Figure 18.1 summarizes the epidemiology of the mood
disorders.

Aetiology
Similarly to depression, bipolar disorder is thought to arise
from an interaction between genes and environmental
stress, with genes being particularly important. Twin studies estimate heritability at 65–80%. First degree relatives of
a patient with bipolar disorder have a roughly seven-fold
increased risk of bipolar disorder (10%), a two- to threefold increased risk of unipolar depression (20–30%),
and a higher risk of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. Thus genetic susceptibility for severe mental disorder
is not disorder-specific: patients with a family history of
any of bipolar, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
are at increased risk of bipolar disorder. Risk for most patients is likely contributed to by multiple alleles of small
individual effect, although some rare high penetrance alleles probably also exist. Many of the mutations identified
so far that slightly increase the risk of bipolar disorder also
increase the risk of schizophrenia, including genes related
to neuronal development, neurotransmitter metabolism
(dopamine and serotonin) and ion channels.
The most important environmental risk factor is
childbirth. There is a 50% risk of mania post partum
in those with untreated bipolar affective disorder.
Neurobiologically, structural and functional abnormalities in brain regions linked to emotion (particularly
hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate and corpus
callosum) have been identified. Multiple neurotransmitter
pathways have been implicated, including an association
between increased levels of monoamines and mania.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapters 7 and 8.

• Treatment of acute mania or hypomania.
• Treatment of acute depression.
• Maintenance treatment (prevention of relapse).

Treatment setting
The initial treatment setting depends on the presentation and severity of illness. A manic episode may necessitate a period of hospitalization in cases of:
• Reckless behaviour endangering the patient or
others around them.
• Significant psychotic symptoms.
• Impaired judgement (e.g. sexual indiscretion,
overspending).
• Excessive psychomotor agitation with risk of selfinjury, dehydration and exhaustion.
• Thoughts of harming self or others.
Detention under mental health legislation is often necessary in patients with reduced insight, or in those lacking capacity to make decisions regarding treatment.
Patients with bipolar disorder may also require hospital
admission for depressive episodes for reasons outlined
on p. 134.

Pharmacological treatment
The mainstays of acute and maintenance treatment
of bipolar illness are mood stabilizers (lithium and
some antiepileptics (sodium valproate/valproic acid,
lamotrigine and carbamazepine)) and antipsychotics
(which stabilize mood as well as reduce psychotic
symptoms).

Treatment of acute mania or hypomania
Antidepressants should be discontinued (this may need to
be gradual if half-life is short, to avoid discontinuation
symptoms). Short term, benzodiazepines are often helpful in reducing severe behavioural disturbance. An
antimanic agent should be started. NICE (2006) recommends an antipsychotic (olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone), in part because of their benefits in reducing
behavioural disturbance. If valproate or lithium have
previously been of benefit, they can be restarted, although
they take longer to have effect. Because lithium can be
harmful if taken for less than 2 years (discontinuation
of lithium can precipitate mania), it is not advisable to
start lithium in a manic patient who is unlikely to be concordant with long-term treatment. If a patient is already
taking an antimanic agent the dose can be increased, or
augmentation with a further antimanic agent considered.

137

The mood (affective) disorders

Treatment of acute depression in context
of bipolar disorder
Antidepressants need to be co-prescribed with an antimanic agent, to avoid precipitating a hypomanic or manic
episode. They should not be prescribed for mild depressive symptoms, only moderate–severe. Doses should
start low and increase only gradually. SSRIs are first line,
or quetiapine can be considered if not already on an antipsychotic (quetiapine also has antidepressant properties). Long-term antidepressants should be avoided,
with gradual discontinuation once depression has been
in remission for 8 weeks.

Maintenance treatment
Not everyone who has suffered from a manic or hypomanic episode needs long-term prophylactic treatment.
NICE (2006) recommends maintenance treatment in
those who have had a manic episode associated with serious adverse risk or consequences, a manic episode and
another disordered mood episode, or repeated hypomanic or depressive episodes with significant functional
impairment or risk. Treatment for at least 2 years is
recommended.
If maintenance treatment is indicated, NICE (2006)
recommends lithium, valproate or olanzapine. The
choice depends on sex, physical comorbidity and patient preference. All mood stabilizers are teratogenic
so women of childbearing age should be advised to
use reliable contraception, and valproate avoided if at
all possible as it is associated with a high risk of neural
tube defects. After initiation of valproate, liver and haematological function need to be monitored in the first 6
months. Lithium requires regular blood tests (usually
3-monthly) to monitor plasma level. Discontinuation
of lithium can precipitate relapse, meaning net benefit
is likely to be gained only after at least 2 years of treatment. Anyone on long-term antipsychotic therapy
needs at least annual screening for metabolic syndrome.
If one maintenance medication is ineffective, consider
switching to an alternative or augmentation with one
of the three. If a combination is ineffective, consider
carbamazepine. Lamotrigine can be considered for
maintenance treatment if the majority of episodes are
depressive.
HINTS AND TIPS
Always ask about the number of previous episodes
of mania and depression. This will affect the diagnosis
and response to treatment. Those that ‘rapid cycle’
(four or more episodes in 1 year) respond poorly to
lithium, and an alternative mood stabilizer may be
more appropriate.

138

HINTS AND TIPS
Do not forget to take a comprehensive family history –
including of treatment of psychiatric diagnoses. There
is evidence to suggest that the level of response to
lithium runs in families.

HINTS AND TIPS
Different preparations of lithium and valproate (which
can mean sodium valproate, valproic acid, or
semi-sodium valproate) have different bioavailabilities
so it is important to specify the preparation
when prescribing.

Psychological treatment
Psychotherapy is performed much less commonly in
bipolar affective disorder than in unipolar depression;
however, it may play a supportive role and help to improve concordance and awareness of early warning signs
of relapse.

Electroconvulsive therapy
Although ECT may precipitate a manic episode in
bipolar patients, it can be an effective antimanic agent,
superior even to lithium, especially in severe mania and
mixed states.

Course and prognosis
More than 90% of patients who have a single manic episode go on to have future episodes. The frequency of
episodes varies considerably, but on average equates
to four mood episodes in 10 years. Between 5% and
15% of patients have four or more mood episodes (depressive, manic or mixed) within 1 year, which is termed
rapid cycling and is associated with a poor prognosis.
Completed suicide occurs in 10–15% of patients.

DYSTHYMIA AND CYCLOTHYMIA

Aetiology
The extent to which the aetiologies of dysthymia and cyclothymia resemble those of depression and bipolar affective disorder is unclear. There are biological similarities
between dysthymia and depression; for example, REM
(rapid eye movement) latency is decreased in both conditions. Genetic studies link cyclothymia and bipolar

Dysthymia and cyclothymia
affective disorder, as up to a third of patients with the former have a positive family history of the latter.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis

Epidemiology and course

Discussed in Chapters 7 and 8.

Figure 18.1 summarizes the epidemiology of the mood
disorders. Both dysthymia and cyclothymia have an insidious onset and a chronic course, often beginning in
childhood or adolescence. A significant number of patients with cyclothymia will go on to suffer more severe
affective disorders, most notably bipolar affective disorder. Dysthymia may coexist with depressive episodes
(‘double depression’), anxiety disorders and borderline
personality disorder.

Management

18

The two conditions may be treated pharmacologically
with the same drugs used in depressive and bipolar
affective disorder, but antidepressants should be used
with caution in cyclothymia owing to their occasional
tendency to turn mild depressive symptoms into hypomania. Psychological therapy may be useful for both
conditions.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The prevalence of schizophrenia across socioeconomic classes
• The epidemiological and prognostic differences between men and women with schizophrenia
• How to respond to parents who ask you whether their other child will also develop schizophrenia
• Pharmacological and psychological management of schizophrenia
• A definition of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and its management

• How to manage acute behavioural disturbance

The main types of psychotic disorder are schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, and acute
and transient psychoses. This chapter will concentrate
on schizophrenia, the most prevalent and widely
researched disorder in this group.

SCHIZOPHRENIA

History
Ideas about the disorder we now term schizophrenia
crystallized towards the end of the 19th century. The
concept of this disorder has evolved during the 20th
century. Important landmarks in the definition of this
disorder are:
• 1893: Emil Kraepelin separated affective psychoses
(e.g. mania) from non-affective psychoses; he gave
the term ‘dementia praecox’ to clinical conditions
resembling the main forms of schizophrenia.
• 1911: Eugen Bleuler coined the term ‘schizophrenia’
(‘splitting of the mind’); his description placed more
emphasis on thought disorder and negative symptoms than on positive symptoms.
• 1959: Kurt Schneider defined first rank symptoms,
which are now the basis of criteria (a)–(d) of the
ICD-10 classification (see Figs 9.6 and 9.7).
• 1970 to the present: the main international classification systems, ICD-10 and DSM-IV, have further
clarified the diagnostic criteria. The main distinction
between ICD-10 and DSM-IV is that the latter
specifies a 6-month duration of symptoms and
places a large emphasis on social or occupational
dysfunction.

Epidemiology
• The incidence is approximately 15/100 000 individuals per year.
• The prevalence varies geographically but is approximately 1% in most settings.
• The lifetime risk is approximately 1% (see also
Fig. 19.1).
• The age of onset is typically between late teens and
mid-30s. Women have a later age of onset. Men:
18–25 years; women: 25–35 years.
• Men have a higher incidence than women (ratio of
1.4:1) but equal prevalence (possibly due to a higher
rate of mortality among male sufferers).
• There is an increased prevalence in lower socioeconomic classes (classes IV and V). This is more likely
to be due to social drift (impairment of functioning
caused by schizophrenia results in a ‘drift’ down the
social scale) rather than social causation (poor socioeconomic conditions contribute to the development of schizophrenia).
• There is an increased incidence in urban (inner city)
compared to rural areas.
• The incidence and prevalence is higher in migrants,
with a relative risk of 4.6.

Aetiology
The aetiology of schizophrenia involves a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors.

Genetic
There is a strong tendency for schizophrenia to run
in families. Figure 19.1 shows the lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia if relatives have schizophrenia.

Lifetime risk

Fig. 19.1 Lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia if relatives
have schizophrenia

Twin studies show a higher concordance rate for monozygotic twins (50%) than for dizygotic twins (10%), although this also shows that environmental factors are
important, as monozygotic concordance is not 100%.
Adoption studies provide further evidence for a genetic
factor: babies adopted away from parents with schizophrenia to parents without retain their increased risk,
whereas the risk is not increased when babies are
adopted to parents with schizophrenia from biological
parents without. A number of genetic variations associated with a small to moderate increase in risk have been
identified, mainly in genes implicated in neurodevelopment and glutamate and dopamine metabolism. Rare
high penetrance genetic variations also exist, for example, deletion of a region of chromosome 22 is associated
with a 30% risk of schizophrenia. The overall risk is
likely to result from a complex interaction of a large
number of genes, and their interaction with environmental factors.

Structural and functional brain abnormalities are associated with schizophrenia, even in those with first episode psychosis who have never received treatment.
Structural imaging is not yet diagnostic, but frequently
identified abnormalities include:
• Ventricular enlargement (appears to be associated
with negative symptoms).
• Reduced brain size (frontal and temporal lobes, hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus).
• Reduced connectivity between brain regions (particularly frontal and temporal lobes).
Furthermore, people with schizophrenia demonstrate a
wide range of cognitive abnormalities, particularly on
tasks testing social cognition and memory. They also experience abnormalities of sensory integration leading to
‘soft’ neurological signs, e.g. abnormalities of stereognosis or proprioception.

Neurotransmitter abnormalities
Based largely on the effects of the conventional antipsychotics (which block dopamine D2 receptors), the dopamine hypothesis suggests that schizophrenia is
secondary to overactivity of the mesolimbic dopamine
pathway in the brain. Furthermore, drugs that potentiate this pathway (e.g. amfetamines, antiparkinsonian
drugs) are known to cause psychotic symptoms. However, excess dopamine may be a consequence rather
than the cause of schizophrenia. Other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and glutamate, have also been
implicated.

Life events
COMMUNICATION
Schizophrenia is not purely genetic in aetiology –
environment is also important. You may want to bear
this in mind when discussing the diagnosis with patients
and their families: parents may find a genetic
description accusational while for the patient it will
have ramifications about having children themselves.

Developmental factors
Schizophrenia is associated with complications during
pregnancy and birth. In addition, the observation that
more people with schizophrenia are born in late winter

142

Stressful life events occur more frequently in the month
before a first psychotic episode or relapse, and may,
therefore, precipitate the illness. However, it may be
that the early stages of the illness itself cause the stressful
events.

Expressed emotion
When family or carers become over-involved, overcritical or hostile towards a patient with schizophrenia, he or she is more likely to relapse. This interaction has been termed ‘high expressed emotion’ and
exerts an influence if contact is greater than 35 hours
a week.

Schizophrenia
COMMUNICATION
Between the 1940s and 1970s, the concept of the
‘schizophrenogenic mother’ was common, and
suggested that schizophrenia was caused by early life
difficulties in the relationship between the patient and
their family. Advances in aetiological studies have
rendered this theory invalid; however, some family
members may still blame themselves. They should be
reassured, and explanation of more valid aetiological
factors given.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapter 9.

Management
There is no known cure for schizophrenia. Management
is aimed at improving symptoms and preventing
relapse. Long-term medication is the mainstay of treatment, although psychosocial treatment is also very
important.

Treatment setting
The initial treatment setting depends on the presentation and severity of illness. Home treatment is preferable but hospitalization is often necessary in cases of first
episode psychosis and when there is a significant risk
that psychotic symptoms may lead to harm to self or
others, or self-neglect. Detention under mental health
legislation may be necessary in patients with reduced insight and impaired judgement.
Long-term community management is provided by
community mental health teams or assertive outreach
teams with the help of a care coordinator and regular
follow-up in a psychiatric out-patient clinic. Patients
with schizophrenia who have symptoms that are stable
and well controlled can be managed in primary care.

Pharmacological treatment
Antipsychotics are of benefit in reducing positive symptoms (e.g. delusions and hallucinations). However,
they have little or no benefit on negative symptoms
(e.g. apathy and social withdrawal). Differences in
efficacy between antipsychotics are small, with the exception of clozapine, which is the most effective antipsychotic known, but is not used first line because of
its side-effects. Therefore the main factor influencing
choice of antipsychotic is tolerability. Antipsychotics

19

commonly cause side-effects, and as they are generally
long-term medications, it is important to find one
whose side-effects the patient feels they can tolerate
for the foreseeable future. See Figure 19.2 for a comparison of some common antipsychotic side-effects and
see Chapter 2 for more information on antipsychotic
side-effects and classification.
Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is defined as a lack
of satisfactory clinical improvement despite the sequential use of at least two antipsychotics for 6–8 weeks, one
of which should be a second generation antipsychotic.
If a patient appears treatment resistant, reassess the diagnosis, check concordance, check psychological therapies
have been offered and assess for comorbid substance
use. If treatment resistance is confirmed, offer clozapine
at the earliest opportunity, assuming there are no contraindications and the patient is in agreement with taking
oral medication and attending for regular blood tests.
Clozapine is not used as a first line medication due to
its significant side-effects including life-threatening
agranulocytosis in just less than 1% of patients. Thus, regular haematological monitoring is obligatory (initially
weekly, then monthly) and patients are required to be
registered with a monitoring service. Clozapine will
benefit over 60% of treatment-resistant patients.
Concordance with medication is poor in schizophrenia, with around 75% of patients stopping antipsychotics
within 2 years. This frequently leads to relapse. Concordance can be increased by the use of depot intramuscular
medication (administered 1–4 weekly), increased social
support and patient education.
The length of treatment requires careful consideration as single episodes cannot be predicted and most
patients with schizophrenia relapse. After a first episode,
prophylactic treatment is recommended for 1–2 years
but relapse rates are high (80–98%). Relapse is less
likely if withdrawal is gradual, over a few weeks. For
most patients, antipsychotics are a long-term, lifelong,
treatment.
HINTS AND TIPS
Acute dystonias are a particularly distressing side-effect
of antipsychotics. They can be caused by any dopamine
antagonist (e.g. the antiemetic metoclopramide), so
they may be encountered in other specialities too. They
should be promptly treated with an anticholinergic
such as procyclidine, parenterally if required (see
Fig. 2.10).

Other pharmacological treatments
Benzodiazepines can be of enormous benefit in shortterm relief of behavioural disturbance, insomnia,

aggression and agitation, but they do not have any
specific antipsychotic effect.
Antidepressants and lithium are sometimes used to
augment antipsychotics in treatment-resistant cases, especially when there are significant affective symptoms,
as is the case in schizoaffective disorders, or in postschizophrenia depression.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is now rarely used
in schizophrenia. The usual indication is the rare case
with severe catatonic symptoms.
HINTS AND TIPS
Early institution of medication may improve prognosis.
Early detection is therefore critical. If uncertain, take a
collateral history – a family member may well have
noticed changes earlier and this may prove invaluable.
You will particularly want to bear this in mind with
young male patients who often have an earlier onset, a
worse outcome and prominent negative symptoms
that may have been mistaken for depressive
symptoms.

144

Physical health monitoring
Patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of
cardiovascular disease. This risk is increased further by
the use of antipsychotics. Therefore NICE (2009) recommends a health screen should be carried out
at least annually, focusing on cardiovascular risk factors.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is needed prior to commencing an antipsychotic if the patient is in hospital,
has a history of cardiovascular disease, a family history
of sudden cardiac death, or has evidence of cardiovascular disease on examination (e.g. hypertension). Pretreatment ECGs are also recommended for some antipsychotics at high risk of prolonging the QTc interval
(e.g. haloperidol).

Psychological treatments
Historically psychotic disorders were thought to be
unresponsive to psychological interventions, but increasing evidence points towards their value in augmenting drug treatments:
• Schizophrenia can be a devastating condition and
is associated with significant social morbidity.

Schizophrenia
Therefore, the importance of support, advice, reassurance and education to both patients and carers
cannot be overemphasized.
• Cognitive-behavioural therapy has been shown to
be effective in reducing some symptoms in schizophrenia. It is also useful for helping patients with
poor insight come to terms with their illness, thereby
increasing concordance with medication. It can also
help the patient become aware of early warning signs
of relapse. It is recommended by NICE (2009) for all
patients with schizophrenia.
• Family psychological interventions focus on alliance
building, reduction of expressions of hostility and
criticism (expressed emotion), setting of appropriate
expectations and limits, and effecting change in
relatives’ behaviour and belief systems. Family intervention has been shown to reduce relapse and admission rates. It is recommended by NICE (2009)
for all patients with schizophrenia who live with
or are in close contact with their family.

Social inputs
Issues beyond drug and psychological treatment should
be addressed to optimize community functioning; these
include financial benefits, occupation, accommodation, daytime activities, social supports and support
for carers. A variety of agencies can provide these services, notably, health services, social services, local authorities, local support groups and national support
groups (SANE, MIND).
All patients with schizophrenia should be assessed
for the care programme approach (CPA) to achieve
optimum coordination in the delivery of services. Community psychiatric nurses (CPNs), consultant psychiatrists, occupational therapists, psychologists or social
workers are appointed as care coordinators. Their primary role is to coordinate the multifaceted aspects of
patients’ care and to monitor mental state and concordance with medication.

Acute behavioural disturbance
Severe psychomotor agitation or aggressive behaviours
frequently occur in acutely ill psychotic patients. Note
that in patients who are not well known, it is vital that
the correct diagnosis is established. Many other conditions, for example mania, delirium, alcohol and substance withdrawal and dementia, can present with
acute aggression and agitation, all of which require special consideration. The algorithm in Figure 19.3 describes the principles of acute management. Many
regions also have local protocols.

19

HINTS AND TIPS
Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine that has a
reliable rate of absorption from muscle tissue and
therefore should always be used, if at all possible, when
benzodiazepines are given intramuscularly. Other
advantages include its relatively short half-life
(10–20 hours) and its lack of active metabolites during
elimination (no accumulation).

Course and prognosis
The course of schizophrenia is highly variable and difficult to predict for individual patients. In general, the
disorder is chronic, showing a relapsing and remitting
pattern. About 20% have a single lifetime episode with
no further relapses. However, more than 50% of patients have a poor outcome characterized by repeated
psychotic episodes with hospitalizations, depression
and suicide attempts.
About 10% of patients with schizophrenia will die by
suicide. Those most at risk are young men who have
attained a high level of education and who have some insight into their illness. The periods soon after the onset of
illness and in the months following discharge from hospital are particularly high risk, although all patients with
schizophrenia are at lifelong increased risk of suicide.
The lifespan for patients with schizophrenia is on
average 15 years shorter than for the general population.
Causal factors include suicide, increased smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and accidents.
The overall prognosis for schizophrenia appears to
be better in low income as opposed to middle and high
income countries; the reasons are unclear but may reflect better extended-family social support or greater social acceptance once recovered. The factors associated
with a good prognosis are:

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The key epidemiological differences between anxiety disorders
• The cognitive model for panic attacks
• Indications for benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety
• Which anxiety disorders are treated with SSRIs as a first-line pharmacological option
• Why clomipramine is effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
• The treatment options for patients with a specific phobia
• The role of medication in treating somatoform disorders

This chapter discusses the most important disorders associated with the presenting complaints in Chapters 10, 11,
12 and 13, which you might find helpful to read first.

ANXIETY DISORDERS

HINTS AND TIPS
Anxiety disorders tend to be more common in women
than men, apart from social phobia and obsessivecompulsive disorder where the prevalence is about
equal.

Epidemiology
The anxiety disorders are the most common of all the psychiatric disorders with a combined 1-year prevalence rate
of 12–17%. Epidemiological data collected from different
countries have shown varying prevalence rates for the individual anxiety disorders, likely reflecting varying thresholds for diagnosis (see Fig. 20.1 for the epidemiology of
the anxiety disorders). It is important to remember that
anxiety disorders are usually underdiagnosed in primary
care settings, or only recognized years after onset. A large
UK survey found that only a third of people with clinically
significant anxiety disorders were receiving treatment of
any kind (psychological or pharmacological).
COMMUNICATION
The anxiety disorders are frequent and closely related
in aetiology, symptoms and management. For this
reason they are often grouped together along with
depression under the heading ‘common mental disorders’.

HINTS AND TIPS
In clinical settings, over 95% of patients who present
with agoraphobia also have a current diagnosis or a
past history of panic disorder. You may want to bear
this in mind while screening for symptoms.

Aetiology
Genetic and biological factors
Genetic factors contribute moderately to risk for development of most anxiety disorders. There is likely to be
considerable genetic overlap with depression. It is possible that different environmental experiences in people
with similar genetic vulnerabilities lead to either depression or anxiety, or both.
Panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) appear to be the most heritable anxiety disorders, with more than a third of those affected having
a first-degree relative with the same diagnosis. OCD
shares genetic risk with Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome
(see p. 191).
The three main neurotransmitter systems implicated
in anxiety disorders are GABA, serotonin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Evidence for their role is that
these are the neurotransmitters predominantly affected
by benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Furthermore, some polymorphisms in genes related to
these systems have been found to increase the risk of
anxiety disorders.
Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are often reported
following damage to the caudate nucleus (e.g. Sydenham’s
chorea). Amygdala hyperactivation is found in a number

of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and social phobia, in response
to the relevant anxiety-inducing stimuli. However,
anxiety disorders likely reflect abnormalities in networks of brain regions, rather than individual regions
alone.

Social and psychological factors
Anxiety disorders have been linked to stressful life
events. In PTSD a significant traumatic event is essential
to the diagnosis, although only around 10–30% of people who experience such an event go on to develop
PTSD. Psychosocial stressors may also precede the onset
of symptoms in other anxiety disorders.
Cognitive-behavioural theories suggest that symptoms are a consequence of inappropriate thought processes and over-estimation of dangers, as in the case
of panic attacks:
• A cognitive model of the panic attack suggests that
an attack may be initiated when a susceptible individual misinterprets a normal body stimulus. For
example, a patient may become aware of their
heart beating. Instead of dismissing this as normal,
they may assume that it is under excessive pressure
and that something could be physically wrong.
This fear activates the sympathetic nervous system
(the ‘fight or flight’ response), producing a real
increase in the rate and strength of the heart beat.
A vicious cycle ensues in which the perception of
increasing cardiac effort convinces the sufferer
that they are on the point of collapse or a myocardial infarction. The resulting crescendo of symptoms may proceed to a full-blown panic attack
involving several of the panic symptoms listed in
Figure 10.2 (p. 78).

148

Cognitive-behavioural models for phobias suggest a
two-step process:
• A neutral stimulus is paired with an aversive stimulus (classical conditioning, e.g. driving and an
accident) or anxiety is felt about an intrinsically aversive stimulus (e.g. a snake).
• The neutral stimulus is then associated with anxiety, and avoiding it reduces anxiety (e.g. not driving
after an accident, not going into the reptile house
in the zoo). The association thus becomes selfreinforcing (operant conditioning) and it becomes
increasingly difficult to be exposed to the neutral
stimulus (e.g. not getting into a car at all, not going
to the zoo at all).
These theories explain why techniques such as exposure
response prevention (see p. 28) are effective.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapters 10, 11, 12 and 13.

Management
HINTS AND TIPS
Although patients may have genes and life experiences
that predispose them to anxiety disorders, often
maladaptive patterns of thinking and behaviour
exacerbate and maintain symptoms. This means that
psychoeducation and psychological therapies can be
very effective.

Anxiety disorders
Psychological therapies are recommended as first-line
treatment for anxiety disorders, particularly milder
forms. Pharmacological treatments are also of benefit,
but longer term treatment is generally required so the
risk of side-effects and complications is high. Pharmacological treatment can be offered first line for moderate–

20

severe anxiety disorders if a patient wishes this, or if
psychological treatment has been insufficient. In severe
cases, combining the two is required. Figure 20.2 summarizes the most important concepts in treating anxiety
disorders, based on NICE guidelines for common mental health disorders (2011), generalized anxiety disorder

The anxiety and somatoform disorders
and panic disorder (2011), PTSD (2005) and OCD
(2005). It is important that you familiarize yourself with
this diagram, as anxiety disorders are common in
primary care settings and 90% are managed there.

•

Psychological treatment
• There is strong evidence for the use of cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT) in most anxiety disorders.
• CBT is the first-line treatment for specific phobias,
mainly in the form of behaviour therapy, which
may involve systematic desensitization, flooding or
modelling (see Ch. 28).
• In panic disorder, CBT may help the sufferer to understand that panic attacks can start from a misinterpretation of a normal stimulus, leading to a ‘vicious
cycle’ of spiralling fear and sympathetic activation.
When the patient understands this model, the therapist may encourage the patient to break the cycle by
promoting rejection of the assumption that the
original stimulus (e.g. palpitations) is indicative of
impending physical dysfunction (e.g. heart attack).
• Effective treatments in post-traumatic stress disorder include trauma-focused CBT (CBT addressing thoughts
and behaviours related to memories of the trauma)
or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
therapy (where the patient is asked to think about the
trauma while concentrating on a therapist’s finger moving from side to side) (see p. 31). Psychological debriefing immediately after trauma is not advised.
• Applied relaxation is used in generalized anxiety disorder. This focuses on being able to relax muscularly
during situations in which the patient is or may be
anxious.
• Other therapies commonly used in anxiety disorders
include supportive, psychodynamic and family therapies although there is less evidence for their efficacy
(see p. 26 and p. 29).
• Counselling may be helpful for patients who are
experiencing stressful life events, illnesses or bereavements (see p. 25).

Pharmacological treatment
• In general, drugs need to be titrated up to higher
doses and take longer to work in anxiety disorders
than in depression (e.g. up to 12 weeks at the British
National Formulary maximum dose for a trial of an
SSRI in OCD).
• SSRIs are first-line treatments for most anxiety disorders due to their proven efficacy and tolerable sideeffect profile. Venlafaxine has a similar side-effect
profile and also has proven efficacy in generalized
anxiety disorder.
• TCAs are generally considered second-line treatments
owing to their increased frequency of adverse effects

150

•

•

•

•

(e.g. dry mouth, sedation, postural hypotension,
tachycardia). Clomipramine, the most serotonergic
of the TCAs, has proven efficacy in OCD.
Restlessness, jitteriness and an initial increase in anxiety symptoms may occur in the first few days of
treatment with either the SSRIs or the TCAs, which
may reduce concordance in already anxious patients.
This can be managed by titrating the dose up slowly
or by using benzodiazepines in combination with
antidepressants during the first few days of
treatment.
Benzodiazepines are highly effective in reducing
anxiety. However, the rapid development of tolerance and dependence means they are not recommended for the majority of anxiety disorders. They
can be prescribed as a short-term hypnotic in PTSD,
or for infrequent ‘as required’ use in social phobia
(e.g. to allow a speech to be given) or specific phobias (e.g. to allow blood to be taken). They are not
recommended for generalized anxiety disorder,
panic disorder or OCD.
A beta blocker such as propranolol can also be used
as required to reduce autonomic arousal to anxietyinducing stimuli.
Pregabalin is a GABA analogue which is licensed for
treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, epilepsy
and neuropathic pain.
The monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), despite being effective in some conditions, are not
considered first-line treatment for anxiety owing to
the possibility of severe side-effects and interactions
with other drugs or food components (cheese reaction, see p. 16).

HINTS AND TIPS
Inhibition of serotonin uptake seems to be the
essential component of effective drug therapy for
obsessive-compulsive disorder as evidenced by the
efficacy of the SSRIs and clomipramine. Clomipramine,
which predominantly inhibits serotonin reuptake,
is more effective than the other tricyclic
antidepressants with predominant noradrenaline
(norepinephrine) reuptake inhibition (e.g. desipramine,
nortriptyline).

Course and prognosis
The prognoses of the anxiety disorders vary greatly
between individuals:
• Generalized anxiety: is likely to be chronic, but fluctuating, often worsening during times of stress.

Somatoform disorders
• Panic disorder: depending on treatment, up to onehalf of patients with panic disorder may be symptom-free after 3 years, but one-third of the remainder
have chronic symptoms that are sufficiently distressing to significantly reduce quality of life. Panic
attacks are central to the development of agoraphobia, which usually develops within 1 year after the
onset of recurrent panic attacks.
• Social phobia: usually has a chronic course, although
adults may have long periods of remission.
Life stressors (e.g. a new job), may exacerbate
symptoms.
• Specific phobias: have an uncertain long-term prognosis, but it is thought that simple phobias that
persist from childhood are less likely to remit
than those that begin in response to distress in
adulthood.
• Post-traumatic stress disorder: approximately half of
patients will recover fully within 3 months. However, a third of patients are left with moderate to
severe symptoms in the long term. The severity,
duration and proximity of a patient’s exposure to
the original trauma are the most important prognostic indicators.
• Obsessive-compulsive disorder: the majority have a
chronic fluctuating course, with worsening of symptoms during times of stress. About 15% of patients
show a progressive deterioration in functioning.

SOMATOFORM DISORDERS
The somatoform disorders: somatization disorder, hypochondriacal disorder (including body dysmorphic
disorder), somatoform autonomic dysfunction, persistent somatoform pain disorder, and factitious disorder
and malingering were discussed in Chapter 13. This section will focus on the most common of these: somatization disorder and hypochondriacal disorder.

20

Aetiology
The aetiology of somatoform disorders is poorly understood, although episodes often follow the appearance of
a stressor.
Somatization disorder may be due in part to genetic
factors, with associations identified between somatic
symptoms and mutations in genes related to serotonin
metabolism and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA) axis. Childhood sexual abuse increases the risk
of the disorder, although not all patients with the disorder have been abused. Growing up in environments
where physical distress is more readily acknowledged
than psychological distress may have a role. Symptoms
often have onset or worsen after a stressor and this may
be because emotional states influence the way pain and
other bodily sensations are perceived.
Patients with hypochondriacal disorder may have a
lower threshold for suspecting illness or may subconsciously covet the gains to be had from adopting the
sick role.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapter 13.

Course and prognosis
Both somatization disorder and hypochondriacal disorder tend to have a chronic episodic course, with waxing
and waning symptoms often exacerbated by stress.
Good prognostic features in hypochondriacal disorder
include acute onset, brief duration, mild hypochondriacal symptoms, the presence of genuine physical comorbidity and the absence of a comorbid psychiatric
disorder.

Fig. 20.4 Role of the general practitioner in managing patients with somatoform disorders

• Arrange to see patients at regular fixed intervals, rather than reacting to the patient’s frequent requests to be seen
• Increase support during times of stress for the patient
• Take symptoms seriously, but also encourage patients to talk about emotional problems, rather than just focusing on
physical complaints

• Limit the use of unnecessary medication, especially those that may be abused (e.g. benzodiazepines, opiates)
• Treat coexisting mental disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression)
• Limit investigations to those absolutely necessary
• Have a high threshold for referral to specialists
• If possible, arrange that patients are only seen by one or two doctors in the practice to help with containment and to
limit iatrogenic harm

• Help patients to think in terms of coping with their problem, rather than curing it
• Involve other family members and carers in the management plan
• Consider referral to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist

and group psychotherapy (mainly CBT) may be useful
in reducing symptoms by helping patients to cope
with their symptoms and develop alternative strategies for expressing their emotions. Figure 20.4 summarizes the role of the general practitioner (GP) in

152

managing patients with somatoform disorders. A supportive relationship with an empathic doctor able
to work with the patient to guide understanding of
their condition is likely to be the most important
intervention.

After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The safe levels of alcohol consumption and how many people in the UK exceed those limits
• Psychological theories of alcohol and substance dependence
• What detoxification aims to treat and how it differs from the treatment of dependence

This chapter discusses the disorders associated with the
presenting complaints in Chapter 15, which you might
find helpful to read first. Alcohol-related disorders will
be presented first, followed by other psychoactive
substances.

Aetiology
The causes of alcohol dependence are multifactorial and
are determined by biological, psychological and sociocultural factors.

Genetic and biochemical factors

ALCOHOL DISORDERS

Epidemiology
Prevalence rates vary considerably depending on the
geographical location, the age group surveyed and
how drinking problems are defined:
• Hazardous drinking was found in 24% of adults in
England (33% of men and 16% of women) in
2007. Alcohol dependence was found in 9% of
men and 4% of women aged 16–75.
• There were 1 057 000 alcohol-related admissions to
English hospitals in 2009/2010. This is nearly twice
as many as in 2002/2003 (510 800).
• The annual cost to the National Health Service
(NHS) of alcohol-related harm in England was estimated to be £2.7 billion in 2006/2007 prices.
• Just over 12 000 people were estimated to be injured
or killed as a result of drink-driving accidents on UK
roads in 2010.
Remember that the safe daily alcohol limits are not
more than 3–4 units/day for men and 2–3 units/day
for women (see Fig. 15.2, p. 117), with at least two
alcohol-free days per week. It is thought that 37% of
men and 29% of women in Great Britain frequently
exceed these limits.

Strong evidence shows a genetic component to alcohol
dependence. Family studies show an increased risk of
dependence among relatives of dependent individuals.
Twin studies indicate that monozygotic twins have a
higher concordance rate than dizygotic twins, and
adoption studies also indicate a heritable component.
The nature of this influence is unclear. It may operate
at the level of heritable personality characteristics or it
might relate to the body’s inherited biochemical susceptibility to alcohol and its consequences. For example,
50% of East-Asians have a deficiency in mitochondrial
aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to flushing and palpitations after small quantities of alcohol; this may
explain reduced rates of consumption and dependence
in these cultures.
From a biochemical perspective, chronic alcohol consumption produces decreasing activity (‘down-regulation’)
of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems and increasing
activity (‘up-regulation’) of glutamate (mainly N-methylD-aspartate, or NMDA) systems. Both of these changes increase the likelihood of neuroexcitability and withdrawal
seizures on cessation of drinking.

Psychological factors
Behavioural models explain dependence in terms of operant conditioning where:

153

Alcohol and substance-related disorders
• Positive reinforcement occurs when the pleasant effects
of alcohol consumption reinforce drinking behaviour
(despite adverse social and medical consequences).
• Negative reinforcement occurs when continued drinking behaviour is reinforced by the desire to avoid the
negative effects of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
An alternative behavioural explanation is the observational learning theory (modelling), which suggests that
patterns of drinking are modelled on the drinking behaviour of relatives or peers. Family studies support
the idea that drinking habits follow those of older
relatives.
The presence of psychiatric (anxiety, bipolar affective
disorder, depression, schizophrenia) or physical illness
appears to increase the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence, although differentiating cause and effect can be
difficult (see Ch. 15, p. 120). There is also evidence linking alcohol dependence with antisocial and borderline
personality traits. Possible explanations for this could
include any of the following: attempts to self-medicate
to relieve symptoms, the use of alcohol as a (maladaptive) coping mechanism, the lack of a supportive environment, impulsivity, or the lack of insight into the
risks associated with excessive alcohol.

Social and environmental factors
The cultural attitude towards alcohol affects the prevalence of alcohol-related problems (e.g. lower rates in
Jewish societies as opposed to Mediterranean countries). Enormous cross-cultural variation in the way that
people behave when drinking alcohol has been noted
(e.g. alcohol consumption in the UK, US and Australia
is associated with antisocial behaviour and violence,
while in Mediterranean countries it is generally more
peaceful), suggesting that the effect that alcohol has
on behaviour is linked to social and cultural factors
rather than solely to the chemical effects of ethanol.
Alcohol consumption is greatly affected by price; some
evidence exists to suggest that less alcohol is consumed
and there are fewer alcohol-related illnesses in countries
where it is expensive.
There is an association between certain occupations
and deaths from alcoholic liver disease. The highest risk
professions are members of leisure and catering trades
(publicans especially), doctors, journalists, and those
involved with shipping and travel. Furthermore, higher
rates of dependence are noted in unskilled workers and
the unemployed compared to the higher social classes
(this may be partly explained by the ‘social drift’ caused
by alcohol dependence (see p. 118).
The frequency of significant life events increases the
risk of harmful drinking. Although the anxiolytic properties of alcohol are often used as a means of coping
with stress, the social and physical complications of
heavy drinking often lead to even further stress.

154

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapter 15.

Management
The management of alcohol-related problems can vary
markedly depending on the pattern of use. Advice about
reducing intake may be sufficient for hazardous
drinkers, and can be delivered by general practitioners
(GPs). Dependent drinkers may require a more intensive intervention, delivered by a specialist alcohol advisory service. Management of the latter group can be
considered as having two overlapping objectives: the
treatment of alcohol withdrawal and the longer term
maintenance of abstinence.

Treatment of alcohol withdrawal
All clinicians need to be able to recognize alcohol withdrawal because of its high mortality and morbidity. The
treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is commonly termed ‘detoxification’. The following points are
important:
• For the majority of patients, an out-patient or
community-based detoxification will be safe and
effective.
• Contraindications to detoxification in the community
include severe dependence, a history of withdrawal
seizures or delirium tremens, an unsupportive home
environment, or a previous failed community detoxification. In these cases, in-patient detoxification is
advised.
• Unplanned, short notice detoxification should only
be undertaken if absolutely necessary, e.g. if a patient
has to be an in-patient for another reason. In general, detoxification works best when it is planned
in advance, to allow the perpetuating factors for dependence to be addressed alongside detoxification.
• In order to relieve severe symptoms and reduce the risk
of developing seizures or delirium tremens, a drug
with similar neurochemical effects to alcohol is prescribed, usually a benzodiazepine (such as chlordiazepoxide, diazepam or lorazepam). Initially, high doses
are given, which are gradually reduced over 5–7 days.
• In order to prevent development of Wernicke–
Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine is given. Oral supplements may occasionally be adequate, however in
hospital this is often given parenterally in the form
of Pabrinex®.
Figure 21.1 summarizes the management of delirium
tremens (and Wernicke’s encephalopathy).

Alcohol disorders
Fig. 21.1 Management of delirium tremens

Emergency hospitalization essential
Vigorous search for a medical complication, e.g.:
• Infection
• Head injury
• Liver failure
• Gastrointestinal haemorrhage
• Wernicke’s encephalopathy
Medication:
• Large doses of a drug with similar neurochemical
actions to alcohol, e.g. benzodiazepines. Intravenous
therapy seldom needed. Also treats seizures
• Only use antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) for severe
psychotic symptoms (risk of lowering seizure
threshold)
• Large doses of parenteral (intramuscular or slow
intravenous) thiamine – two Pabrinex® ampoules
twice daily for 5 days. Oral thiamine is not adequate
in delirium tremens
Monitoring of temperature, fluid, electrolytes
and glucose:
• Risk of hyperthermia, dehydration, hypoglycaemia,

alcohol. They work best when offered as an adjunct to
appropriate psychosocial measures:
• Disulfiram (Antabuse®): blocks the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, causing an accumulation of acetaldehyde if alcohol is consumed. This causes
unpleasant symptoms of anxiety, flushing, palpitations, headache and nausea very soon after alcohol
consumption. It is contraindicated in patients with
compromised cardiorespiratory function.
• Acamprosate (Campral®): enhances GABA transmission and appears to reduce the likelihood of relapse
after detoxification by reducing craving. It is safe to
use while drinking.
• Naltrexone (Nalorex®): blocks opioid receptors, and
appears to both reduce cravings for alcohol, and –
when taken in conjunction with normal drinking –
reduces the pleasant effect of alcohol, therefore
decreasing the desire to drink (the ‘Sinclair method’).
• The use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines is
not recommended as pharmacological means for
the maintenance treatment of abstinence from alcohol; however, they can be useful for the treatment of
comorbid psychiatric illness.

Psychosocial interventions
COMMUNICATION
Some patients think that ‘detoxification’ refers to the
treatment of alcohol dependence; however, it only
refers to the management of physical and psychiatric
symptoms of withdrawal. Treating alcohol dependence
involves addressing biological, psychological and social
factors that may have precipitated and perpetuated
its development.

HINTS AND TIPS
Delirium tremens is a medical emergency that is
common on medical and surgical wards. Despite
appropriate care and treatment, it is associated with
a mortality rate of 5–15% (estimated to be as high as
35% if untreated), emphasizing the need for prompt
recognition and appropriate treatment. Make sure
that you know the symptoms (Ch. 15) and
management well.

Maintenance after detoxification
Pharmacological therapy
Various pharmacological strategies have been shown to
be useful in the maintenance of abstinence from

Not all interventions are suited to all patients and the
care package needs to be tailored accordingly. The various forms of psychosocial intervention that have been
shown to be effective in managing alcohol problems
include:
• Motivational interviewing: the application of Prochaska and DiClemente’s stages of change model
(Fig. 21.2).
• Cognitive-behavioural therapy: focusing on cue exposure, relapse prevention work, behavioural contracting.
• Group therapy: psychoeducational, supportive, interpersonal process, skill development, cognitivebehavioural therapy.
• Alcoholics Anonymous: based around a 12-step programme of spiritual and character development.
• Social support: social workers, probation officers
and citizens advice agencies may be able to help with
homelessness, criminal charges and debt.
• Primary prevention: increasing the cost of alcohol
through taxation appears to be the most effective
strategy in reducing overall consumption. Limiting
availability, curtailing advertising and health education seem less effective measures.

Course and prognosis
Alcohol dependence has a variable course and is often
associated with numerous relapses. However, the prognosis is not as poor as is often thought, as some studies
show a higher than 65% 1-year abstinence rate

following treatment. Good prognostic indicators include being in a stable relationship, employment, having stable living conditions with good social supports,
and having good insight and motivation. In general,
alcohol-dependent individuals have a 3.6-fold excess
mortality compared with age-matched controls. The
lifetime risk of suicide is 3–4%, which is 60–120 times
greater than that of the general population.

OTHER PSYCHOACTIVE
SUBSTANCES

Epidemiology
• The lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use among
adults of all ages was 36.3% in England and Wales
in 2010–11 (i.e. over a third of the population have
used illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime).
• Although heroin is the most frequently encountered
‘problem drug’, cannabis was the most commonly

156

consumed used illegal drug in 2010, used by 6.8%
of the population. This was followed by powder
cocaine (2.1%), and mephedrone (1.4%).
• The prevalence of drug dependence in the general
population of England and Wales in 2010–11
was 3.4%. This varies according to age: 10.2% of
16–24-year-olds are dependent compared with
0.3% of 65–74 year olds. This also varies according
to sex: 4.5% of all males are dependent compared to
2.3% of females.
• There were 204 473 adults in contact with structured
drug treatment services in England in 2010–11 to address their use of heroin (49%), crack cocaine (3%),
or both (32%). Most individuals in treatment were
male (73.2%).
• Among 11–15-year-olds in England in 2010, 8.2%
reported using cannabis in the last year. This has decreased from 13.4% in 2001.

The penalties applicable to offences involving drugs are graded broadly according to the harmfulness considered to be
attributable to a drug when it is misused. Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, drugs are divided into three groups
according to their perceived dangerousness:
Penalty for possession

diamorphine (heroin), methadone, cocaine
(including crack), psilocybin (magic

both

Up to 14 years in
prison or an unlimited

Aetiology
Occasional or experimental use of illicit substances is not
the same as drug dependence. However, ongoing use of
illicit substances over a period of time can lead to development of a dependence syndrome, particularly drugs
with a strong potential for the development of dependence (namely opiates and cocaine). Dependence of
any drug is associated with stimulation of the brain’s
‘reward system’ (by increasing dopamine release in the
mesolimbic pathway). Aetiological factors for illicit drug
dependence are not well understood, although they appear to be related to a mixture of biopsychosocial factors.
The operant conditioning model described in the alcohol
section also applies to other psychoactive substances.
Similarly, price, availability and cultural attitudes appear
to be key factors influencing the use of illicit substances.
In addition, social deprivation, a family environment of
substance abuse, conduct disorder in childhood, antisocial personality disorder and severe mental illness all
increase the likelihood of substance misuse problems.

Assessment, clinical features, drug
classification and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapter 15.

Management
Management of illicit drug dependence involves addressing both the physical detoxification process and the
maintenance of abstinence by addressing predisposing,
precipitating and perpetuating factors within the biological, psychological and sociocultural domains. A detailed description of management strategies regarding

the use of all illicit substances is beyond the scope of this
book. However, key points on the treatment of opiates
and benzodiazepines are below.

Opiates
• Patients should be given education about harm minimization, including the risks of using contaminated
injecting equipment (HIV, viral hepatitis, infective
endocarditis, etc.) and unsafe sexual behaviour.
Clean needles, injecting equipment and condoms
can be offered.
• Opiate withdrawal is uncomfortable and distressing,
although it is not life-threatening and may be
attempted rapidly in mild to moderate dependence.
If required, symptoms can be ameliorated by lofexidine, a centrally acting a-adrenoceptor agonist
that reduces sympathetic outflow. Other drug treatments, such as antiemetics, antidiarrhoea medication and simple analgesia, can also be beneficial.
• Substitution therapy, where another substance is prescribed as an alternative to illicit opiate use, helps to
stabilize the user’s life, and to prevent the complications of injecting. One such example is methadone,
a long-acting oral opiate. Before prescribing, opiate
use must be confirmed by a urine drug screen as serious respiratory depression may result if the patient is
not already tolerant to opiates, or if an excessive dose
of methadone is given. Methadone may be prescribed
indefinitely, but the aim is normally for gradual
reduction with long-term abstinence.
• Buprenorphine (Subutex®), a partial opiate agonist,
is also used as substitution therapy. Note that because it is only a partial agonist, it may precipitate
withdrawal in patients who are dependent on high
doses of opiates (equivalent to more than 30 mg
methadone daily).

157

Alcohol and substance-related disorders
• Once the patient has been detoxified, naltrexone (an
opiate antagonist) can be used to block the euphoriant
effects of future opiate use. It induces withdrawal if the
patient is still dependent.
• Psychological interventions are integral to good
therapeutic outcomes and include motivational
interviewing, cognitive-behavioural therapy (including relapse prevention), and group therapy.
• Perpetuating sociocultural factors should be addressed as part of the maintenance of abstinence.
These can include issues with family and peers, housing and homelessness, prostitution, engagement with
healthcare and social services, and criminality.

Benzodiazepines
Caution must be exercised when attempting withdrawal
from benzodiazepines as it can be fatal. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may include hallucinations,
convulsions and delirium. Symptoms can emerge within
hours to days, depending on the half-life of the benzodiazepine. Management of benzodiazepine withdrawal involves initially converting drugs with a shorter half-life
(e.g. lorazepam) to drugs with a longer half-life (usually
diazepam). Doses are then reduced very slowly by a small
amount every few weeks, depending on patient response.

HINTS AND TIPS
HINTS AND TIPS
When a patient is admitted to hospital, always confirm
methadone and benzodiazepine doses with the main
prescriber as soon as possible. Patients can sometimes
provide inaccurate information.

158

Sudden discontinuation of a patient’s long-term
sleeping tablet when they are admitted to hospital can
lead to a withdrawal syndrome: only consider this if the
patient’s condition means benzodiazepines must be
avoided, and ideally reduce the dose gradually.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The differences and similarities in epidemiology between personality disorders
• The psychosocial interventions that may be beneficial in the management of personality disorder
• The role of psychotropic medication in the management of personality disorder
• Strategies for the short- and long-term management of patients with personality disorder
• How personality disorders and other mental illnesses are related in terms of prognosis

This chapter discusses the disorders associated with the
presenting complaints in Chapter 16, which you might
find helpful to read first.

THE PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Epidemiology
There is a lack of consensus about the definition of personality disorders. Although DSM-IV and ICD-10 classification systems have produced definitions, it is rare for
a patient with a personality disorder to neatly match
with only one discrete category. It is also unclear
whether there is any correlation between diagnostic criteria and the subjective experiences of people identified
as having disordered personality. While a number of
structured interview schedules and diagnostic instruments have been validated, the level of correlation
between these is generally poor. Mental health professionals also remain divided as to how personality disorders should be conceptualized, with some clinicians
questioning whether the diagnosis is of any clinical
benefit.
Patients with personality disorders have a significantly increased mortality, as well as physical and psychiatric morbidity. Relationships with relatives and
friends are adversely affected, and there is a strong association between some types of personality disorder and
involvement with healthcare and criminal justice
services.
Community studies have shown the prevalence of
any personality disorder to be 4–13%, with an increased
prevalence in younger age groups (particularly 25–44
years), and an equal distribution between the sexes. This
varies according to the population group sampled. It is
higher in patients frequently consulting general practitioners (GPs) (10–30%), even higher in psychiatric

out-patient clinics (30–40%), and higher still in psychiatric inpatients (40–50%), self-harming patients
(40–80%) and prisons (50–80%).
Figure 22.1 describes the prevalence of the individual
disorders and their relevant epidemiology. Note the
broad ranges of prevalence from different studies,
highlighting the lack of correlation in the current
literature.

Aetiology
Different environmental and biological/genetic factors
are implicated in the aetiology of different personality
disorders, supporting their heterogenicity:
• Monozygotic twins show a higher concordance for
personality disorders than dizygotic twins.
• Cluster A personality disorders (see Fig. 16.1) (especially schizotypal) are more common in the relatives
of patients with schizophrenia.
• Some authors have suggested that schizoid and
schizotypal personality disorders may be neurodevelopmental disorder, possibly within the autistic
spectrum.
• Depressive disorders are more common in the
relatives of patients with borderline personality
disorder.
• Early adverse social circumstances (such as parental
alcoholism, physical or emotional neglect, violence,
sexual abuse) are associated with the development
of cluster B personality disorders (see Fig. 16.1).
• There is a strong association between borderline personality disorder and childhood sexual abuse,
although this is not universal.
• Various psychoanalytical theories suggest that
disordered attachment between infants and their
caregivers lead to difficulties in relationships throughout the rest of life, which may manifest as personality
disorders.

Management
In the past, there has been considerable debate concerning how (and by whom) patients with personality disorders should be managed. Previously, personality
disorders were generally considered to be untreatable.
However, advances in diagnosis, psychotherapy and
psychopharmacology have equipped clinicians with a
variety of treatment options that can be useful in maximizing engagement with services, reducing distress, managing
comorbid mental illness and substance misuse, improving relationships and optimizing quality of life.
Patients with borderline personality disorder are frequently encountered in clinical practice, and thus will
be the focus of this section.

160

Principles of managing patients with
borderline personality disorder
Patients with borderline personality disorder should
not be excluded from health or social care services because of their diagnosis or because they have self-harmed.
A consistent and tolerant approach should be taken.
Autonomy and choice should be encouraged, with the
patient being actively involved in deciding treatment
options and in finding solutions to their problems. An
optimistic, trusting and non-judgemental relationship
should be developed. Endings and transitions may evoke
strong emotions and reactions in patients with borderline personality disorder, and as such should be carefully
planned and structured to minimize distress. A multidisciplinary approach to care should be considered, as
psychological, social and biological treatment modalities
all have an important role. A comprehensive assessment
should be made of sources of distress to self and others
(thoughts, emotions, behaviour and relationships),
other comorbid mental illness and specific impairments
of functioning at work or home.

The personality disorders

Crisis management
It can be useful to develop a crisis management plan in
conjunction with the patient, detailing self-management strategies, sources of support (family, friends,
telephone-based services), and details on how to access
emergency care. This should be shared with the patient
and other relevant professionals (GPs, assessment and
crisis teams).
Short-term drug treatments can be useful to alleviate
distress during a crisis. If possible, this should be agreed
in advance with the care team and the patient. Drugs with
acceptable side-effects and low dependence profiles are
preferable, and should be dispensed in small quantities
if there is a risk of overdose. Drugs should not be used in
place of other more appropriate interventions.
Before admission to acute in-patient psychiatric
care, crisis resolution or home treatment teams should
be considered. Admission may be necessary if the
management of the crisis involves significant risk to
self or others that cannot be managed within other
services. If possible, actively involve the patient in
the decision, and ensure that it is based on an explicit,
joint understanding of the potential benefits (and
likely harm) that may result from admission. Agree
the length and purpose of the admission in advance.
If the patient is detained under mental health legislation, ensure that this is regularly reviewed and that
management on a voluntary basis is resumed at the
earliest opportunity.
After a crisis has resolved, ensure that the care plan is
updated. If drug treatment was started, review this and
discontinue if possible. If this is not possible, ensure
that it is regularly reviewed to monitor effectiveness,
side-effects, misuse and dependency.

Short-term management
While treatment of borderline personality disorder
should be considered to be a long-term process, various
biological, psychological and social management strategies can be employed in the shorter term, with the aim
of facilitating trust, building a positive relationship with
health and social care services, and identifying and alleviating sources of distress.

Psychopharmacology
There are no medications that are currently licensed specifically (in the UK) for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. However, drugs can be useful to treat
comorbid mental illness, or to manage cases of behavioural disturbance and suicidal behaviour during the
more severe phases. Antipsychotics may be of some
use in treating the pseudo-psychotic symptoms that
are sometimes experienced. Antidepressants may be
useful in treating depressive symptoms. SSRIs may help

22

with obsessive-compulsive symptoms as well as impulsivity and self-harming behaviour. Mood stabilizers
such as lithium, sodium valproate and lamotrigine
may be useful in treating aggression, impulsivity and
mood instability. Benzodiazepines should be used with
caution due to the potential for abuse and dependence.

Psychosocial
Supportive psychotherapy provides patients with an authority figure during times of crisis. Regular contact with
a healthcare professional can also provide the patient
with a sense of containment. Members of the multidisciplinary team can provide psychoeducation, as well as
facilitating development of coping strategies, relaxation,
distraction techniques, improving disturbed relationships and development of skills and hobbies. In cooperation with social services, issues such as housing,
finances and employment can be addressed.

Longer term management
The long-term management of patients with borderline
personality disorder involves addressing and modifying
maladaptive traits of personality. This generally involves
a psychotherapeutic modality of treatment. Because traits
and behaviours tend to be deeply engrained, this process
can take many years. Around 40% of people with borderline personality disorder disengage with psychotherapy,
and so it is important to build a trusting relationship and
to be prepared for therapeutic change taking a long time.
There is evidence suggesting the efficacy of various
modalities of psychotherapy in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. It may be that the consistency
of therapy, the maintenance of boundaries and the empathic and non-judgemental stance of the therapist allows for the successful development of a therapeutic
relationship, which may in itself be more important
than the specific type of therapy. For more information
on psychotherapy, see Chapter 3.
• Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) (see p. 31) uses
a combination of cognitive and behavioural therapies, with some relaxation techniques from Zen Buddhism. It involves both individual and group
therapy, and can be helpful in reducing self-harming
and improving functioning.
• Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) (see p. 31) focuses
on allowing patients to better understand what is
going on in both their minds and in the minds of
others. It can utilize both individual and group components, and can be effective in the treatment of
borderline personality disorder.
• Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (see p. 28) can
be adapted for use in borderline personality
disorder.

161

The personality disorders
• Cognitive analytical therapy (CAT) (see p. 31) may be
useful in the treatment of borderline personality
disorder.
• Psychodynamic psychotherapy (see p. 26), as both
individual and group therapy, can be effective in
the treatment of borderline personality disorder.
• Therapeutic communities (see p.30) are a residential
form of therapy, where the patient may stay for
weeks or months. The community tends to run as
a ‘democracy’, with patients often having as much
say as the staff. Most of the therapeutic work is done
in groups, and patients learn from getting on (or
not getting on) with others. It differs from ‘real life’
in that any disagreements or upsets happen in a
controlled and safe environment.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that personality disorders involve longstanding personality traits. While they are ‘treatable’,
pharmacotherapy is not the mainstay, but is used to
alleviate specific symptoms (e.g. comorbid depression,
anxiety or impulsivity). Medications are unlikely to
affect maladaptive personality traits. With appropriate
psychosocial interventions, these may significantly

162

improve with time. You may want to consider this
when discussing management with patients.

Course and prognosis
The course of personality disorders, and the prognosis
of sufferers, is not as dire as was once thought. Some
78–99% of patients with borderline personality disorder will show signs of sustained symptomatic remission
at 16-year follow-up. Patients with antisocial personality may also improve with time, especially if they have
formed a relationship with a therapist. Schizotypal
and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders tend
to be stable over time, although schizotypal patients
may go on to develop schizophrenia.
Patients with personality disorder have a greater incidence of other mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar affective disorder, anxiety and schizophrenia.
Furthermore, these tend to be more severe and have a
worse prognosis than if the personality disorder was
not present. Patients with personality disorder (especially cluster B) also have far higher rates of suicide
and accidental death than the general population.

• The epidemiology of anorexia nervosa
• The difference between anorexia and bulimia nervosa
• The importance of family history and environmental factors in patients with anorexia and bulimia
nervosa
• The role of antidepressants in the treatment of patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa

This chapter discusses the disorders associated with the
presenting complaints in Chapter 17, which you might
find helpful to read first.

ANOREXIA AND BULIMIA
NERVOSA

Epidemiology
Eating disorders are approximately 10 times more common in females than males. As many as one female in 20
will have eating habits which give cause for concern, and
most will be between the ages of 14 and 25 years old. The
incidence rates of anorexia nervosa in the general population is 11 per 100 000 population. The exact incidence
of bulimia nervosa is difficult to calculate, because many
sufferers do not come to the attention of services. However, it is estimated that the incidence of bulimia nervosa
is approximately five times that of anorexia nervosa. In
terms of prevalence, between 0.5% and 1% of the female
population are thought to suffer from bulimia nervosa.
Eating disorders are far more common in certain occupations, specifically ballet dancers, gymnasts and athletes.
Anorexia nervosa was previously considered to be more
prevalent in higher socioeconomic classes; however, recent evidence has challenged this. Bulimia nervosa has
an equal prevalence across all socioeconomic classes.
Figure 23.1 summarizes the epidemiology of both anorexia and bulimia nervosa.

Aetiology
The cause of neither anorexia nor bulimia has been clarified, but both biological and psychosocial factors have
been implicated.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00023-0

Anorexia nervosa
Genetic/biological factors
Estimates from twin studies suggest that 58–76% of the
variance in the liability to anorexia nervosa is due to
genetic factors. There is a higher concordance rate for
monozygotic (55%) than dizygotic twins (5%). Abnormalities of serotonin metabolism have been implicated. It is possible that the inherited liability might
be mediated by certain personality traits, including
inhibition, perfectionism, obsessionality and harmavoidance.

Environmental/psychological factors
In Western culture, the widely portrayed notion of the
‘ideal body’ influences perception of body image, meaning that unusual thinness is often valued more than natural curves. Relationship difficulties are often (but not
always) found within families of patients with anorexia
nervosa, including over-protectiveness, enmeshment
(over-involvement, with lack of differentiation between
parent and child), conflict avoidance, lack of conflict
resolution and rigidity (resistance to change).

Bulimia nervosa
Genetic/biological factors
The genetic contribution to variance in liability to bulimia nervosa is 54–83%. Serotonin, noradrenaline
(norepinephrine) and plasma endorphins have all been
implicated, although many neurotransmitter abnormalities occur secondary to weight loss and purging.
There is often a family history of depression and/or substance misuse.

Environmental/psychological factors
Past exposure to dieting behaviour, which is more common in patients with a history of childhood obesity, parental obesity and early menarche, is usually present.
Family relationships seem to be more conflictual than
in patients with anorexia nervosa. The personality trait
of perfectionism appears to be a risk factor, but to a
lesser extent than in anorexia nervosa. Alcohol and substance abuse, personality disorders and depression are
associated conditions.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations, complications and
differential diagnosis
Discussed in Chapter 17.
HINTS AND TIPS
Although depression and obsessive-compulsive
disorder may coexist with anorexia nervosa, these
symptoms can also result from the effects of starvation.
It may help to think ‘what happened first?’, and limit
the use of drug treatment to symptoms that are
particularly severe, or which do not improve with
weight gain.

Management
Anorexia nervosa
Ambivalence towards treatment coupled with the psychological consequences of starvation (poor concentration, depression, lethargy) means that anorexia nervosa
is often difficult to treat. Treatment should be collaborative, with an early aim of establishing a therapeutic alliance. Motivational interviewing and the application of
the transtheoretical model of change (see Ch. 21, p.156)
can be helpful for engaging patients and overcoming

164

treatment resistance. The severity of the illness determines the level of care:
• Patients who simply diet excessively can be treated
with education about nutrition and weight monitoring by a general practitioner (GP) or nurse. Voluntary organizations and self-help groups may also
be helpful.
• Psychotherapy, preferably with familial involvement,
is the treatment modality of choice for patients with
anorexia nervosa. Weight should be monitored, and
medical complications (see Fig. 17.3, p.129) actively
sought. A multidisciplinary approach is required, involving the GP, a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist and
possibly a member of the community mental health
team. In young people, it may be beneficial to involve
a paediatrician. Figure 23.2 summarizes the various
forms of psychosocial therapeutic interventions.
• There should be a low threshold for referral to a specialist eating disorder service, especially in patients
who are resistant to out-patient treatment, and those
who have severe anorexia or poor prognostic factors
(Fig. 23.3). Many areas have multidisciplinary intensive home treatment teams (see Ch. 5) specifically
for patients with anorexia nervosa.
• Hospitalization is necessary in certain medical circumstances (e.g. body mass index less than
13.5 kg/m2, rapid weight loss, severe electrolyte abnormalities, syncope) and psychiatric circumstances
(risk of suicide, social crisis).
• In severe cases, patients can lose insight into the severity of their illness, by virtue of both the psychopathology of the illness and the neuropsychological
effects of starvation. Where a patient lacks capacity
to make decisions regarding their care and treatment, it may be necessary to use mental health legislation (see Ch. 4) to effect compulsory admission
to hospital, and to initiate life-saving treatment.
• While mental health legislation in all UK countries
only makes provision for the compulsory treatment
of mental illness (not physical illness), food is considered to be treatment for mental illness because it

leads to improvement in the psychological symptoms (impaired decision making) caused by starvation. Therefore, as a final resort, in certain cases
patients may be force-fed under mental health legislation. In extreme cases, nasogastric or intravenous
feeding may be necessary.
When a patient starts eating after a prolonged (more
than 5 days) period of starvation, care must be taken
to avoid the refeeding syndrome (Fig. 23.4), which is
characterized by fluid and electrolyte disturbances. This
can have potentially fatal consequences. Management
hinges on replacement of fluid and electrolytes, which
may need to be intravenous.
The use of psychotropic medication is limited, and
should be instituted cautiously in patients who are underweight. SSRIs may be useful for treating comorbid
depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Bulimia nervosa
Patients with bulimia nervosa tend to be more motivated to address their eating difficulties, and are usually
of a normal weight. Treatment is predominantly psychological, ranging from psychoeducation, self-help
manuals and self-help groups in mild cases, to cognitive-behavioural therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy in more serious cases. Management by specialist
eating disorder services may be necessary in severe cases.
In-patient treatment is not usually required; however, it
may be necessary for the treatment of electrolyte disturbances resultant from purging (which can be fatal), or
for management of the risk of suicide or self-harm. Antidepressants (high-dose SSRIs) can be useful to reduce
bingeing and purging behaviour. Comorbid substance
abuse and depression is common and should be managed as indicated.

165

Prognosis

Bulimia

Anorexia

The course of bulimia is also variable, although generally better than anorexia, with 50–70% of patients
achieving either full or partial recovery after 5 years. It
is thought that bulimia nervosa is not associated with
increased mortality. However, there is a strong association with both depression and substance misuse, and
higher mortality rates are associated with these conditions. Poor prognostic factors include severe bingeing
and purging behaviour, low weight and comorbid
depression.

Although weight and menstrual functioning usually
improve, eating habits and attitudes to body shape and
weight often remain abnormal. Around a fifth of patients
make a full recovery, a quarter develop bulimia nervosa,
and a fifth remain severely unwell. The remainder tend to
follow a relapsing-remitting course. The lifetime mortality from anorexia nervosa is about 15%: around half of
these deaths are due to the complications of starvation,
and around a third by suicide. Factors associated with a
poorer prognosis are described in Figure 23.3, and indicate that poorer outcomes are seen in more severe illness.

Disorders relating to the
menstrual cycle, pregnancy
and the puerperium

24

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The psychiatric symptoms and syndromes occurring in the premenstruum, pregnancy, the puerperium
and the menopause
• The symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and where they occur in the menstrual cycle
• Differences in the aetiology and management of postnatal blues, postnatal depression and puerperal
psychosis
• How to manage the high risk of relapse of bipolar affective disorder during the puerperium
• The management of a woman with postnatal depression who wants to continue breast-feeding
• The factors on mental state examination that would concern you when assessing risk in a woman with
puerperal psychosis
• Issues surrounding mental illness during the menopause

PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME

Clinical features
The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been defined as
the recurrence of symptoms during the premenstruum,
with their absence in the postmenstruum. Symptoms
tend to occur in the 10 days prior to menstruation
and remit in the 2 weeks following. Psychological symptoms include low mood (71%), irritability (56%) and
tiredness (35%). Physical symptoms such as headache
(33%), abdominal bloating (31%) and breast tenderness (21%) are also fairly common.

Epidemiology/aetiology
Up to 40% of women report experiencing some symptoms of PMS and one study described recurrent cyclical
symptoms in up to 80% of women. However, only
about 5% of women experience symptoms of a severity
sufficient to interfere with their work or lifestyle. The
prevalence is higher in women over the age of 30 years,
who are multiparous (prevalence increases with parity),
who do not use oral contraception and who experience
significant degrees of psychosocial stress. Genetic,
hormonal/biological and psychosocial factors have
been implicated in the aetiology (good relationships
are thought to have a protective effect).

Management
Non-specific management of PMS includes reassurance,
advice on healthy eating, stress-reduction, and exercise.
Abstaining from caffeine or alcohol in the week before

menstruation can also be helpful. Psychotherapeutic
intervention may be beneficial, in the form of psychosocial counselling, stress management and cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT). Pharmacological therapies
may be helpful, specifically hormonal contraception
(the combined pill, implants, patches), SSRIs, danazol
(a testosterone analogue) and gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone analogues.

MENOPAUSE
There is little evidence that the menopause itself leads to
an increased incidence of mental illness. Psychological
symptoms may understandably accompany the changes
that occur with the menopause; however, it should be
remembered that this is a time associated with other
psychosocial stressors, such as children leaving home
and a growing awareness of ageing. There is no clear psychiatric indication for hormone replacement therapy
(HRT) and its use for psychological symptoms remains
controversial. HRT should never substitute treatment
with recognized antidepressants for the treatment of a
depressive illness.

PSYCHIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS
IN PREGNANCY
• The development of new psychiatric illnesses during
pregnancy is no more common than in the general
population. However, both psychosocial stressors

167

Disorders relating to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the puerperium
and changing or stopping maintenance medications
in women with a history of major mental illnesses
carries a degree of risk, and the puerperium is a
high-risk period for relapse in major mental illness,
particularly bipolar affective disorder. Domestic violence is more common during pregnancy, and this
can impair mental health and resilience.
• Women with a major mental illness (bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, severe depression) or
history of puerperal psychosis who are pregnant or
planning pregnancy should be referred to perinatal
psychiatry services, even if they have been stable
for some years. Figure 24.1 summarizes the indications for referral to a specialist perinatal mental
health team.
• For patients prescribed psychotropic medication during pregnancy, a judgement needs to be made – in

conjunction with the patient – regarding the risk
of relapse against the risk of medication-induced
teratogenic or adverse effects. Risks associated with
various psychotropic medications are summarized
in Figure 24.2. Decisions should be made prior to
conception (if possible). Up-to-date information
on the use of medications during pregnancy should
always be sought.
• There is an increased incidence of adverse life events
in the weeks prior to a spontaneous abortion
(miscarriage).
• Following miscarriage and termination of pregnancy, there is an increased risk of adjustment and
bereavement reactions (see Ch. 12). Also, the risk
of puerperal psychosis remains.

services

Pseudocyesis is the rare condition when a
non-pregnant woman has the signs and symptoms
of pregnancy (e.g. abdominal distension, breast
enlargement, cessation of menses, enlargement of the
uterus). Couvade syndrome describes the condition
in which men develop typical pregnancy-related
symptoms during their partner’s pregnancy (e.g.
morning sickness, vague abdominal pains, labour

pains). Both of these conditions are psychosomatic and
should be distinguished from delusion of pregnancy.
Pseudocyesis and delusion of pregnancy may occur
together.

PUERPERAL DISORDERS
HINTS AND TIPS
The incidence of psychiatric illness in the puerperium
is exceptionally high. In primiparous women, there is
up to a 35-fold increased risk of developing a psychotic
illness and needing hospital admission in the first
month following childbirth. This emphasizes the
importance of close vigilance in the postpartum
period, especially in women with a personal or family
history of mental illness.

Postnatal ‘blues’
Also known as ‘maternity blues’ and ‘baby blues’, this
occurs in up to 50% of postpartum women. It presents
within the first 10 days post-delivery, and symptoms
peak between days 3 and 5. It is characterized by episodes of tearfulness, mild depression or emotional lability, anxiety and irritability. There appears to be no links
with life events, demographic factors or obstetric events,
which is suggestive of an underlying biological cause
(e.g. a sudden fall in progesterone post-delivery). Postnatal blues is self-limiting, resolves spontaneously and
usually only requires reassurance. However, an apparent bad case of postnatal blues may mark the onset of
postnatal depression.

Postnatal depression
Clinical features
Postnatal depression (PND) usually develops within 3
months of delivery, and typically lasts between 2 and 6
months. The symptoms are similar to a non-puerperal depressive episode: low mood, loss of interest or pleasure,
fatigability and suicidal ideation (although suicide is
rare). Note that sleeping difficulties, weight loss and decreased libido can be normal for the first few months
following delivery. Additional features of PND may
include:
• Anxious preoccupation with the baby’s health, often
associated with feelings of guilt and inadequacy.

24

• Reduced affection for the baby with possible impaired bonding.
• Obsessional phenomena, typically involving recurrent and intrusive thoughts of harming the baby
(it is crucial to ascertain whether these are regarded
as distressing (ego-dystonic), as obsessions usually
are, or whether they pose a potential risk).
• Infanticidal thoughts (thoughts of killing the baby),
which are different from obsessions in that they are
not experienced as distressing (ego-syntonic), may
be seriously considered, and (worryingly) may involve planning. These symptoms necessitate urgent
psychiatric assessment.

Epidemiology and aetiology
In the developed world, postnatal depression is the
most common complication of childbirth, with rates
of around 10%. There does not appear to be an association with socioeconomic class or parity. Evidence suggests that biological factors are not as important as they
are in postnatal blues and puerperal psychosis. Psychosocial factors are strongly linked to the development of
postnatal depression, with the lack of a close confiding
relationship and young maternal age both implicated.
A previous history of depression is an important risk
factor. In women with a history of depression, obstetric
complications during delivery are associated with an
increased rate of postnatal depression.

Management
The diagnosis and management of postnatal depression
is often undertaken within primary care. Psychological
and social measures, such as mother-and-baby groups,
relationship counselling and problem solving, are often
helpful. Midwives and health visitors can be very helpful. For more severe illness, antidepressant medication
is necessary. Antidepressants may be transmitted in
small quantities to the baby via breast milk, and a judgement needs to be made, in conjunction with the patient,
of the risks versus benefits of medication. It should be
noted that (with the exception of doxepin) there has
never been evidence to suggest that antidepressants
transmitted via breast milk have caused harm to a baby,
but there are significant risks for the baby’s cognitive
and emotional development if the mother has
untreated depression. Figure 24.2 provides information
on the use of psychotropic medication in breast-feeding
mothers. Mothers with severe postnatal depression with
suicidal/infanticidal ideation may require hospital
admission, with admission with the baby to a motherand-baby unit usually being preferable. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be indicated and usually results
in a rapid improvement, which is important to allow the
woman to resume contact with the baby as soon as

169

Disorders relating to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the puerperium
possible. Remember that the assessment of the infant’s
well-being is an additional part of the comprehensive
psychosocial and risk assessment.
HINTS AND TIPS
If a woman has been on an antidepressant during
pregnancy, do not change after delivery to a different
antidepressant that is ‘better for breastfeeding’.
Doing this means the child is exposed to two
medications, instead of one. The fetus is exposed to
far greater levels of antidepressant in utero than levels
transmitted in breast milk, so if they are healthy at
delivery they are unlikely to be harmed by further,
lower, exposure.

Prognosis
Most women respond to standard treatment; however,
some patients have a protracted illness and may require
long-term treatment and follow-up. Woman who develop postnatal depression have around a 50% increased risk of developing a similar illness following
childbirth in the future.
Postnatal depression is associated with disturbances
in the mother–infant relationship, and this can lead to
problems with the child’s cognitive and emotional
development.
HINTS AND TIPS
Despite the increased rate of depression, postnatal
suicide is rare. The suicide rate in the year following
childbirth is one-sixth the rate for a matched control
group. However, note that suicide is far more common
than infanticide, so if infanticidal thoughts are present
the risk of suicide should be thoroughly explored.

Puerperal psychosis
Clinical features
The postpartum period is an extremely high-risk period
for the development of a psychotic episode. These episodes characteristically have a rapid onset, usually
between 4 days and 3 weeks post-delivery, and almost
always within 8 weeks. They typically begin with insomnia, restlessness and perplexity, later progressing to suspiciousness and marked psychotic symptoms. The
symptoms can be polymorphic, and frequently fluctuate dramatically in their nature and intensity over a
short space of time. Patients often retain a degree of insight, and may not disclose certain bizarre delusions or

170

suicidal/homicidal thoughts. There is some debate as to
whether the puerperal psychoses represent a separate
disease entity, a mood disorder with psychotic features,
a schizophrenia-like episode, or a combination of these.
In the majority of cases, the clinical presentation resembles a mood disorder (depression or mania) with
delusions and hallucinations. Even when schizophrenia-like symptoms are present, patients often have associated mood symptoms; however, affective and
psychotic symptoms may occur at separate times during
the same illness.

Epidemiology and aetiology
Puerperal psychosis develops in about 1 in 500 childbirths. It occurs more frequently in primiparous
women, and those who have a personal or family
history of bipolar affective disorder or puerperal psychosis. If a close family member has bipolar affective
disorder, the risk can be as high as 15 in 500 childbirths.
Psychosocial factors seem less important, unlike in postnatal depression. Occasionally, a puerperal psychosis
may be precipitated by an obstetric complication (e.g.
pre-eclampsia, puerperal infection) or medication.
Figure 24.3 summarizes the risk factors for puerperal
psychosis.

Management
The assessment of the risk of infanticide and suicide is
crucial. Concerning symptoms include:
• Thoughts of self-harm or harming the baby.
• Severe depressive delusions (e.g. belief that the baby
is, or should be, dead).
• Command hallucinations instructing the mother to
harm herself or her baby.
Hospitalization is invariably necessary, with joint admissions to a mother-and-baby unit being preferable
when the mother is able to look after her infant under
supervision. Detention under mental health legislation
may be necessary. Depending on presentation, antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood-stabilizing medications may be necessary. Benzodiazepines may be

needed in cases of severe behavioural disturbance. All
psychotropic drugs should be used with caution in
breast-feeding mothers (see Fig. 24.2). ECT can be particularly effective in severe or treatment-resistant cases.
Psychosocial interventions are similar to those for other
psychotic episodes, but also include providing support
for the father.

Prognosis
Most cases of puerperal psychosis will have recovered by
3 months (75% within 6 weeks). There is about a 60%
chance of experiencing a recurrence after future childbirths. Women who have had both puerperal and
non-puerperal depressive or manic episodes (i.e. have

24

an established mood disorder) have up to an 85%
chance of future puerperal psychotic episodes.
HINTS AND TIPS
The prevalence of postnatal blues, postnatal depression
and puerperal psychosis is inversely related to their
severity:
• Postnatal blues develops after one in two childbirths.
• Postnatal depression develops after one in eight
childbirths.
• Puerperal psychosis develops after about one in 500
childbirths.

Epidemiology
The overall prevalence of dementia is approximately 1%
of the total UK population, rising sharply with increasing age. Figure 25.1 illustrates the increasing prevalence
of dementia with age. The prevalence in persons aged
65 or over is approximately 7%, in those over 80 about
20% and in those over 90 around 30%. Early onset dementia begins before age 65. Alzheimer’s dementia is
more common in women and vascular dementia more
common in men.
Dementia is a syndrome due to various diseases,
most commonly neurodegeneration or vascular damage
as below:
• Alzheimer’s disease, approximately 30–60% of
cases.
• Vascular dementia, approximately 10–30%.
• Combined Alzheimer’s and vascular (‘mixed’) dementia, approximately 10–30%.
• Dementia with Lewy bodies, approximately 5%.
• Frontotemporal dementia, approximately 2% (20%
of early onset dementia).

Aetiopathology
Each type of dementia will be discussed separately.

Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is classified as:
• Early onset (onset before age 65, usually familial,
with relatives also affected before age 65).
• Late onset/sporadic (onset after age 65, either no
family history or relatives affected after age 65).
At present, the cause of most cases of AD is unknown. It
appears to be a combination of multifactorial genetic
risk factors, vascular risk factors and other uncertain
environmental factors. The characteristic pathological
changes are:
1. Beta-amyloid plaques between neurones.
2. Neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau
inside neurones.
It is unclear whether either of these changes are a cause
or a consequence of neuronal damage and death. The
abnormalities generally begin in the medial temporal
lobe (where key structures relating to memory are
located) before becoming more diffuse, resulting in generalized cortical atrophy and compensatory ventricular
enlargement. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in
the nucleus basalis of Meynert leads to a deficiency of
acetylcholine which can be partially reversed by some
anti-dementia medications (cholinesterase inhibitors).
These drugs can temporarily slow the loss of cognitive
function but not reverse or ultimately prevent it.

Genetic factors
Late-onset AD. There is a three-fold increased risk of developing AD in the first-degree relatives of sufferers. The
most important gene associated with late-onset AD is
the gene that codes a protein involved in cholesterol

173

Dementia and delirium

• In late-onset AD, the ApoE e4 allele increases an
individual’s susceptibility to develop AD.
• In early-onset AD, the possession of a mutated
version of one of three genes, amyloid precursor
protein, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, virtually
guarantees that an individual will develop AD.
Late-onset sporadic AD accounts for the overwhelming
majority of all AD cases.

metabolism called apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which occurs in three different alleles (e2, e3 and e4). Individuals
who inherit one copy of the ApoE e4 allele are at a roughly
three-fold increased risk of developing AD, and those
with two copies are at a roughly 10-fold increased risk.
However, other environmental and genetic factors must
be involved because having two ApoE e4 alleles does
not guarantee the development of AD, and many patients
with AD have no copies of the allele. New genes which
contribute a smaller risk are being discovered through
whole genome analysis of large samples.
Early-onset AD. Some forms of early-onset familial
AD are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
Three genes have been isolated so far:
• Amyloid precursor protein – chromosome 21.
• Presenilin-1 – chromosome 14.
• Presenilin-2 – chromosome 1.
These genes are all involved in metabolism of the amyloid protein. These autosomal dominant dementias present between the ages of 30 and 60 years, sometimes as
early as age 28 when there is a mutation at presenilin 1.
Adults with trisomy 21 (Down’s syndrome) invariably develop neuropathological changes similar to AD
by middle age and many will develop dementia. This
has been attributed to triplication and over-expression
of the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP).
HINTS AND TIPS
You should be aware of four genes in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) – one in late-onset AD, and three in
early-onset autosomal dominant AD:

174

The main environmental risk factors for AD are vascular
(Fig. 25.2). It is unclear whether vascular insufficiency
in part causes the plaques and tangles seen in AD, or
whether vascular damage reduces the brain’s reserve,
making a given amount of neurodegeneration more
likely to manifest clinically. Head injury and low educational attainment are also risk factors.
HINTS AND TIPS
Neurodegeneration seems to be associated with
misplaced proteins: Alzheimer’s, dementia with Lewy
bodies and frontotemporal dementia all involve the
accumulation of degradation-resistant protein
aggregates (see Fig. 25.3 for more detail).

Vascular dementia
The cause of vascular dementia is presumed to be multiple cortical infarctions or many small subcortical
infarctions in white matter (Binswanger’s disease)
resulting from widespread cerebrovascular disease. On
occasions, vascular dementia can arise from a single infarct. As with both Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease, vascular dementia is closely associated
with increasing age. In rare cases, the disease is linked
to NOTCH3, a gene on chromosome 19 involved in vascular smooth muscle cells response to injury (cerebral
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL)). The risk

Dementia with Lewy bodies
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with
Lewy bodies: neuronal inclusions composed of abnormally phosphorylated neurofilament proteins aggregated with ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein. Mutations
in the gene coding for alpha-synuclein causes some
familial cases of DLB, but the cause of sporadic cases
is unclear. The Lewy bodies found in the paralimbic
and neocortical structures of patients with DLB are identical to those found in the basal ganglia of patients with
Parkinson’s disease. Remember from Chapter 14 that
parkinson-like motor features are a core feature of
DLB. Lewy bodies are also found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and Down’s syndrome,
and sometimes in people without dementia.

Parkinson’s disease with dementia
Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease is due to neuronal death
associated with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra,
the site of dopaminergic neurones in the basal ganglia.

However, there are often also diffuse Lewy bodies in
many brain regions other than the basal ganglia. In
around 30% of patients, damage to other brain regions
leads to dementia with predominantly subcortical features. Mutations in genes coding for alpha-synuclein
and proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (e.g. parkin) lead to familial Parkinson’s disease and suggest that abnormal protein degradation
may be part of the pathophysiology of sporadic disease
also. The syndrome of parkinsonism (as opposed to
the specific disorder of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease)
can be due to any injury to the basal ganglia:
cerebrovascular disease, head injury, carbon monoxide
poisoning, dopamine antagonists (including antipsychotic medication), or other neurodegenerative
disorders (e.g. ‘Parkinson’s plus’ syndromes such as
progressive supranuclear palsy).

Frontotemporal dementia
Frontotemporal dementias are a heterogeneous group
of neurodegenerative disorders associated with degeneration of the anterior part of the brain. Their pathology
and presentation overlap with motor neurone disease.
Macroscopically, they are associated with bilateral

175

Dementia and delirium
atrophy of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes
(atrophied paper-thin gyri known as ‘knife-blade
atrophy’) and degeneration of the striatum. Microscopically, a range of intracellular inclusion bodies have
been identified, grouping broadly into those which
include mainly ubiquitin and tau (e.g. Pick’s bodies)
or, more commonly, those which include ubiquitin
and other proteins. Mutations in genes coding for tau
and progranulin (a protein involved in neuronal repair)
cause familial frontotemporal dementias.

6–8 months. The electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristically shows stereotyped sharp wave complexes.
New variant CJD (nvCJD) is thought to be secondary
to the ingestion of BSE-infected beef products. It typically presents in young adults with mild psychiatric
symptoms such as depression and anxiety preceding
the development of ataxia, dementia and finally death
over a period of 18 months. There are no characteristic
EEG changes, although nvCJD may have a characteristic
MRI picture: a bilaterally evident high signal in the
pulvinar (post-thalamic) region.

COMMUNICATION
Pick’s disease is strictly a neuropathological diagnosis
requiring the presence of Pick’s bodies at post-mortem,
but some clinicians use it to mean the clinical diagnosis
of any type of frontotemporal dementia.

Huntington’s disease
Huntington’s disease has autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance. It is caused by a gene
on the short arm of chromosome 4 that contains an
excessive number of trinucleotide (CAG) repeat sequences, usually more than 40, which results in production of the abnormal protein ‘huntingtin’. The length of
the abnormal trinucleotide repeat sequence is inversely
correlated to the age of onset of the disease. This abnormal protein is associated with neuronal death, particularly in the basal ganglia, giving rise to the distressing
motor signs of the disease.

Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and other prionrelated diseases
A prion is an infectious protein which can cause fatal
neurodegeneration. All the prion-related disorders result in a spongiform degeneration of the brain in the absence of an inflammatory immune response, associated
with the deposition of the prion protein (PrP) in the
form of beta pleated sheets.
A number of prion diseases exist: kuru (prion transmitted by cannibalism of neural tissue, described in the
highland tribes of New Guinea), Gerstmann–Sträussler
syndrome (autosomal dominant condition caused by
mutation of PrP gene on chromosome 20), scrapie in
sheep and BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)
in cattle.
Most cases of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) appear
to be sporadic, affecting people in their 50s, although
it can be transmitted iatrogenically (e.g. via infected corneal transplants and surgical instruments). It presents
with a rapidly progressing dementia with cerebellar
ataxia and myoclonic jerks over a time course of

176

HIV-related dementia
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) is thought to cause direct damage to the brain
in addition to the complications of HIV infection, such
as opportunistic infections (cerebral cytomegalovirus
infection, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis,
syphilis) and cerebral lymphoma. HIV encephalopathy
presents clinically as a subcortical dementia and neuropathological examination shows diffuse multifocal destruction of the white matter and subcortical structures.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis
Discussed in Chapter 14.

Management
There is no cure for any of the neurodegenerative forms
of dementia. Although the prognosis is invariably poor,
considerable improvements in the quality of patients’
lives are possible through a variety of psychosocial
and pharmaceutical approaches. The principles of management are:
• Treating the underlying cause if possible (e.g. hypothyroidism, modifying vascular risk factors).
• Slowing down the rate of cognitive decline using
anti-dementia drugs if indicated.
• Managing associated disorders or complications
(e.g. aggression, depression, psychotic symptoms).
• Addressing functional problems that result (e.g.
kitchen skills, financial management, social isolation).
• Providing advice and support for carers.
• Advising on legal measures to prepare for loss of
capacity (e.g. Power of Attorney, Advance Statements).

Specific management strategies
Maintaining cognitive functioning
• Structured group cognitive stimulation programmes
can be of benefit in mild to moderate dementia.

Dementia
• The cholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine, are recommended by NICE
(2010) for those patients with Alzheimer’s dementia
whose Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE)
is above 10. Up to half the patients given these drugs
will show a slower rate of cognitive decline and
possible improvement in behavioural and psychological symptoms also. Cholinesterase inhibitors
are probably also of benefit in vascular dementia, although the evidence is less strong. Rivastigmine has
the best evidence of benefit in Lewy body dementia
and dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease.
Medication is of little benefit in frontotemporal
dementia.
• Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, reduces excitotoxic damage by
blocking NMDA receptors, preventing the influx of
calcium. NICE (2010) recommends it for those with
moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease or for those
who cannot tolerate cholinesterase inhibitors.

Reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms
of dementia
• Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are the non-cognitive symptoms of dementia, including anxiety, agitation, delusions,
hallucinations, aggression, wandering and sexual
disinhibition (see p. 107).
• If a patient develops a BPSD, carefully assess for a
change in their physical health, including pain.
People with dementia may find it very difficult to
communicate discomfort. Consider medication sideeffects. Assess for depression. Consider also a change
in the person’s environment – are they troubled by
noise, extremes of temperature, other patients?
• NICE (2010) recommends aromatherapy, massage,
animal-assisted therapy, multi-sensory stimulation
or therapeutic use of music or dancing for agitation.
• Pharmacological treatment can be considered for
disturbed behaviour such as aggression or agitation
that does not respond to non-pharmacological strategies and is causing significant distress or risk. Anxiolytic medication such as trazodone can be useful
because of its relatively benign side-effect profile.
Benzodiazepines should be avoided if at all possible
because they worsen cognition, predispose to
delirium, increase fall risk and may paradoxically
disinhibit (and make more aggressive) those with
dementia.
• Psychotic symptoms do not require treatment if they
are not distressing to the patient nor causing risk to
others. If there is felt to be significant distress a trial
of an antipsychotic can be considered. Consider
and document the increased risk of cerebrovascular
accident. Discontinue if there is no benefit within
12 weeks.

25

• Depression in dementia is managed similarly to depression in older adults but with even more care
taken to avoid anticholinergic drugs, which can
worsen cognition.
HINTS AND TIPS
Low doses of all medications are essential in older
adults. In general, prescribe according to the rule ‘start
low and go slow’. This is particularly true when
prescribing psychotropic medications for those with
vulnerable brains (e.g. dementia) where doses a tenth
of what would be used in a younger adult can be
sufficient.

Legal issues
• People with dementia are likely in due course to lose
the capacity to be able to make decisions about their
welfare and financial affairs. It is advisable to arrange
Power of Attorney as early as possible, before the
person loses capacity to authorize this. They may
also wish to consider an Advance Statement.
• People with dementia may not be safe to drive and
they and their carers should be advised to notify the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and
their insurer of their diagnosis.
HINTS AND TIPS
•Benzodiazepines should be avoided if at all
possible in most patients with dementia, as they are
particularly vulnerable to their adverse effects such as
sedation, falls and delirium.
•Remember that 50% of patients with dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB) will have a catastrophic reaction to
antipsychotics (even atypicals), precipitating potentially
irreversible parkinsonism, impaired consciousness,
severe autonomic symptoms and a two- to
three-fold increase in mortality. Benzodiazepines
and cholinesterase inhibitors are safer in this group
of patients. This exemplifies the need to exercise
caution when prescribing antipsychotics and the
importance of differentiating the various types of
dementia.

Course and prognosis
The course of dementia is invariably progressive. Around a
third of people with dementia live in residential care.
Dementia is a life-shortening illness directly and indirectly, because it reduces the ability to communicate and
tolerate management of physical problems. A diagnosis

177

Dementia and delirium
of dementia roughly halves a person’s remaining life
expectancy. The average duration of survival from the
time of diagnosis of a late onset dementia is 4 years,
although there is a wide range.

DELIRIUM

Epidemiology
Most research into the epidemiology of delirium concentrates on the elderly, who, along with infants and
young children, are more vulnerable to this disorder.
The prevalence in hospitalized, medically ill patients
ranges from 10% to 30%. Between 10% and 15% of
patients over the age of 65 are delirious on admission
and 10–40% develop a delirium during hospitalization.
Patients with dementia are at an increased risk of developing a delirium; up to two-thirds of cases of delirium
occur in patients with dementia.

Aetiology
Delirium is a final common pathway of disrupted
homeostasis. In healthy individuals, a severe insult is required to cause it, e.g. head injury. In those with vulnerable brains, a minor insult is sufficient, e.g. constipation
or a urinary tract infection. The commonest causes are
medication (most commonly anticholinergics, opiates
or benzodiazepines) or systemic illness, particularly infection. See Figure 14.4 for a fuller list. Sometimes no
cause is found – this does not preclude the diagnosis.
The pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear,
and may vary with cause. Suggested mechanisms include:
aberrant stress response (neurotoxic effects of excess
glucocorticoids), disrupted blood–brain barrier (allowing entry of toxins and cytokines to the brain) and
impaired cholinergic neurotransmission.

Assessment, clinical features,
investigations and differential
diagnosis

management algorithm. General principles of management are as follows:
• Hospitalization is essential: delirium is a medical
emergency.
• Vigorously investigate and treat any underlying medical condition.
• To limit confusion and foster trust, try to ensure
that the patient is nursed by the same staff
consistently.
• Merely the physical presence of a reassuring person
is often enough to calm a distressed patient.
• Maximize visual acuity (e.g. glasses, appropriately lit
environment) and hearing ability (e.g. hearing aid,
quiet environment) to avoid misinterpretation of
stimuli.
• Encourage a friend or family member to remain with
the patient to help comfort and orientate them.
• Clocks, calendars and familiar objects may be helpful with orientation.
• Avoid medication unless the patient is causing a risk
to themselves or others.
• Typical antipsychotics, especially low dose haloperidol, are generally effective in treating delirious
symptoms, in part due to their sedative qualities,
but perhaps also due to their effects on the
dopamine–acetylcholine balance.
• Avoid benzodiazepines unless the patient is a risk
and has not responded to haloperidol, as they tend
to prolong delirium. The exception is alcohol- or
substance-related delirium, in which they are highly
effective.
The specific management of delirium tremens is outlined in Chapter 21.

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that delirium indicates the presence of a
medical condition that should be managed on a
medical, not a psychiatric, ward.

Discussed in Chapter 14.

Course and prognosis

Management

The average duration of a delirium is 7 days, but delirium can be prolonged for weeks or months, even after
the initial insult is treated. In-patients who develop delirium have an increased mortality, with around a
third dying during that admission. This is unsurprising
given that delirium is often a sign of severe systemic
illness.

Delirium can be highly distressing for patients and
anxiety-provoking for medical ward staff who are less
used to dealing with agitated patients. It can also be very
distressing for the families and friends of the patient to
see their loved one in this state. See Figure 25.4 for a

Older adult psychiatry

26

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The most prevalent psychiatric disorders in people over the age of 65
• Which features are particularly prominent in depression in older adults
• The dangers of prescribing tricyclic antidepressants to older adults
• How late-onset schizophrenia differs from early-onset schizophrenia
• The role of home assessments in older adult psychiatry
• Factors to consider before prescribing a benzodiazepine to an older adult

The most common psychiatric disorders in older adults
are dementia and delirium (see Ch. 25). This chapter
considers other psychiatric disorders in older adults.
Patients arbitrarily come under the care of older adult
psychiatrists at the age of 65 years, as it is the average age
of retirement. Services for older adults face a huge increase in demand over coming decades. Currently, one
in six of the UK population is aged over 65 but by
2050 one in four people are projected to be over 65.
The number of ‘very old’ (aged over 80) is set to almost
triple by 2050.
Ageing is associated with an increased prevalence of
both mental and physical health problems. Older adults
may also face new social challenges such as coming to
terms with retirement; income reduction; living alone
or being separated from family; death of spouse, siblings and peers; and coping with deteriorating physical
health and mobility.

MENTAL ILLNESS IN OLDER
ADULTS

Epidemiology
The prevalence of all mental illness tends to increase with
age and is about 25–30% in people over the age of 65.
The prevalence of mental illness tends to be higher in residential homes. Figure 26.1 summarizes the prevalence
of the individual psychiatric disorders in older adults.

Depressive disorders
Depression in older adults presents similarly to that in
younger people, although certain features seem more
prevalent:
• Severe psychomotor agitation or retardation.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00026-6

•
•
•
•

Cognitive impairment (‘depressive pseudodementia’).
Poor concentration.
Generalized anxiety.
Excessive concerns about physical health (hypochondriasis).
• When psychotic, older adults are particularly likely
to have hypochondriacal delusions, delusions of
poverty and nihilistic delusions (see p. 69).
Depression is often under-diagnosed in older adults, so
a high index of suspicion is needed. This is important
considering that older adults are at high risk for completed suicide, even though the prevalence of self-harm
in this group is lower than in younger adults.
HINTS AND TIPS
Self-harm in an older adult should be considered to be
with suicidal intent until proven otherwise.

The principles of treatment are the same as for younger adults, although medication should be introduced
cautiously as older adults have an increased risk of developing adverse side-effects and generally need lower
doses. Tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided
if possible as postural hypotension and cognitive
impairment are very common side-effects in older
adults. Response to antidepressants is often slower in
older adults, with benefits taking 6–8 weeks to emerge.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a very effective
treatment for depression in this population group and
should be considered for severe depression, suicidal
ideation, severe psychomotor retardation, failure to
respond to or tolerate medication and previous good
response to ECT. Lithium augmentation may be used
in treatment-resistant cases, although the dose is generally lower than that used in younger adults. Patients

in this age group often need lifelong antidepressant treatment to reduce the chance of relapse. Psychosocial intervention in the form of social support and possibly
cognitive-behavioural therapy are also important.
Poor prognostic factors include comorbid physical
illness, late detection of illness and poor concordance
with antidepressant medication. Depressed older adults
have a higher mortality than the non-depressed do, even
when physical illness is taken into account.
HINTS AND TIPS
Cotard’s syndrome describes the presence of nihilistic
and hypochondriacal delusions as part of a depressive
psychosis and is typically seen in older adults.

Mania
Unlike depression, the incidence of bipolar affective disorder does not increase with age, although late onset
cases seem to be less influenced by genetic factors (fewer
of these patients have positive family histories for mood
disorders). In a fifth of cases, mania is precipitated by an
acute medical condition, e.g. stroke or myocardial infarction. The presentation and treatment is similar to
that of younger adults.

Late-onset schizophrenia (late
paraphrenia)
Older adult psychiatrists in the UK use the term lateonset schizophrenia or late paraphrenia to denote a group
of patients who develop psychotic symptoms late in life,
usually over the age of 60. Late-onset schizophrenia is

182

characterized predominantly by delusional thinking,
usually of a persecutory or grandiose nature. These delusions tend not to be as bizarre as they sometimes are in
earlier onset schizophrenia (e.g. rather than believing
that secret agents are monitoring them by satellite, a patient with paraphrenia may assert that the neighbours
have been poisoning their water supply). Hallucinations
may occur but disorganized thinking, inappropriate affect and catatonic features almost never feature.
The aetiology of late-onset schizophrenia seems different to early-onset schizophrenia in that sufferers are
less likely to have a family history of schizophrenia.
Also, late-onset schizophrenia is far more common in
women than men – unlike early-onset schizophrenia,
which is slightly more likely to arise in men. Sensory
deprivation, particularly hearing loss and social isolation, is also implicated in its aetiology.
The treatment is with antipsychotics but some work
is needed in building up a therapeutic relationship as
these patients are often difficult to engage and poor concordance is associated with a poor treatment response.
Note that although late-onset schizophrenia does seem
to be a distinct entity, it is not a term used by the ICD-10
or DSM-IV; here, these patients would be classified as
having schizophrenia or delusional disorder.
HINTS AND TIPS
Diogenes’ syndrome, or ‘senile squalor’, is the term
used to describe an elderly recluse who lives in a state of
perpetual filth and gross self-neglect, often with the
hoarding of rubbish. This is purely a descriptive term
and may occur in individuals with alcohol abuse, frontal
lobe dysfunction, personality disorder and chronic
psychotic illness. It may also occur at a younger age.

ASSESSMENT CONSIDERATIONS
IN OLDER ADULTS
• Home assessments are a very important part of older
adult psychiatry. Patients can be assessed in their
normal environment and collateral information
can be obtained from family members. It is important to ascertain whether the patient can be managed
at home (i.e. risk of harm to self and others; ability to
carry out activities of daily living (ADL), drive, manage financial affairs, etc.), or whether additional
community support or hospitalization is needed.
• Collateral information from the patient’s general
practitioner (GP), family and neighbours is an important part of history taking.
• Mental state examination follows the same format as
for all adults, although extra consideration should
be given to the assessment of cognitive functioning

Treatment considerations in older adults
and it is advisable to always do a standardized test,
e.g. a Mini-Mental State Examination. (see Fig. 14.12
for alternatives).
• A thorough physical examination is very important.
Do not forget to assess hearing and vision as well as
tremors and involuntary movements.
• Routine investigations in the newly diagnosed or hospitalized older adult include: full blood count, urea
and electrolytes, liver function tests, thyroid function
tests, calcium, glucose, urinalysis (with mid-stream
urine microscopy and culture if indicated), chest
X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG) and consideration
of serum magnesium, phosphate, vitamin B12 and
folate and a CT or MRI head. Remember that the
chances of a physical illness causing or aggravating
a mental deterioration are significant in older adults.

TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS
IN OLDER ADULTS

Physiological changes with ageing
There are a number of physiological changes that occur
with ageing, which may affect the way the body handles
certain drugs. Figure 26.2 describes the most important
changes and their effects. The net result of these changes
is that the tissue concentration of a drug may be increased by over 50%, especially in malnourished, dehydrated and debilitated patients. Therefore the adage,
‘start low and go slow’ applies especially to the use of
psychotropic drugs in the older adult.

Polypharmacy
Those aged over 65 receive 45% of all prescriptions issued in the UK and many of these are for five drugs

26

or more. This increases the risk of adverse reactions,
drug interactions and poor concordance. Prescribing
psychotropic drugs for common symptoms such as insomnia and headache should be avoided as they may
lead to further non-specific symptoms, e.g. confusion,
drowsiness and light-headedness. Medication should
not be a substitute for adequate social care, the lack of
which often underlies many of these symptoms.

Concordance
Concordance is often a problem in older adults, especially with those who are visually impaired, cognitively
impaired, take numerous drugs and live alone. This may
be improved by simplifying medication regimens, taking time to explain dosing schedules, using large font
prescription labels or concordance aids such as dosette
boxes. Organizing supervision of medication taking by
a relative, friend or support worker may be necessary.

Psychosocial interventions
Psychological treatments, such as cognitive-behavioural
therapy can be used with success in older adults as with
younger adults. Reality orientation and reminiscence
therapies have been used to reduce disorientation and
stimulate remote memories in patients with dementia.
Practical psychosocial interventions such as memory
aids (e.g. notebooks, calendars) and assistance with mobility and daily activities by a support worker should not
be underestimated. Occupational therapy assessment of
activities of daily living (ADL), which assess skills such
as washing, dressing, eating, shopping, etc., give carers
an indication of patients’ strengths and weaknesses
and enable a care package to be tailored that caters specifically for these.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• How psychiatric disorders in children are classified
• The main characteristics of autism
• The difference between Rett’s syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder
• Differential diagnoses for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
• The pharmacological and psychosocial management of ADHD
• The difference between conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder
• The causes of school refusal and how it differs from truancy
• The types of tic that occur in Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome, and what conditions it is associated with
• The treatment of non-organic enuresis
• How depression may present in children
• The risk factors for child abuse, and what to do if you suspect a child is at risk

Children are often unable to explicitly verbalize psychological symptoms they might have. In fact, ‘the
problem’ is usually brought to the psychiatrist’s attention by someone else (e.g. parent, schoolteacher, paediatrician). Therefore the presenting problem is most
commonly a complaint about the child’s abnormal behaviour or performance rather than their psychological
symptoms. This normally means that the clinician is
presented with a non-specific presentation (e.g. ‘being
disruptive in the classroom’).
Problems need to be considered in the context of a
child’s developmental stage; for example, ‘temper tantrums’ are normal for a 2-year-old child, but should
have subsided by age 5.

CONSIDERATIONS IN THE
ASSESSMENT OF CHILDREN
• Parents or carers usually accompany children and
young adolescents. It is often useful to first interview
them – with or without the child present – to obtain
a full description of the current concerns, as well as a
complete history (psychiatric, neurodevelopmental,
educational and medical). An indirect evaluation of
the parents’ personalities, marital relationship and
style of parenting often creates another perspective
from which to understand the context of the presenting complaint.
• An interview with the child usually follows. The ability of youngsters to provide a candid account of their

difficulties varies dramatically. To some degree, this
varies with age. The assessment style should be tailored to the individual abilities of the child rather
than to their age. In children who are unable to articulate their inner experiences (usually younger
children), it is often necessary to observe them in
play situations.
• The child’s own understanding of their difficulties should (if possible) be taken into consideration, as this can affect their management
(in terms of motivation to engage with psychosocial interventions, and their concordance with
medication).
• The importance of obtaining collateral information
cannot be overstated. This is extremely important
in fully understanding the development of the
presenting problem, and the child’s premorbid functioning. It includes obtaining academic, educational
or psychological reports as well as discussions with
teachers and any other agencies involved. Remember to obtain consent from the parent/carer (and
the child, if they are able).
• Further information can be obtained from structured and semi-structured interviews (e.g. Kiddie
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia
(K-SADS-P); Diagnostic Interview Schedule for
Children (NIMH-DISC-IV)), objective assessment
instruments (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)), and parent/teacher/self-rating scales
(strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ);
Conners rating scale (CRS-R)).

Child and adolescent psychiatry

CLASSIFICATION
The ICD-10 groups the psychiatric disorders in children
and adolescents into four broad categories:
1. Intellectual disability (formerly referred to as mental
retardation/learning disability) (see Ch. 28).
2. Developmental disorders (specific and pervasive).
3. Acquired disorders with onset usually in childhood
or adolescence.
4. Acquired ‘adult’ disorders with onset in childhood
or adolescence.
While these categories suggest obvious differences between ‘developmental’ and ‘acquired’ disorders, the reality of this division is less clear. Advances in genetic

studies have shown that many ‘acquired’ disorders have
a very strong genetic component, and that both genetic
and environmental aetiological factors are likely to have
a significant influence. Figure 27.1 provides an overview
of the conceptual framework for the disorders of childhood and adolescence.

INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY
By their very nature, intellectual disabilities (formerly
referred to as ‘mental retardation’ and ‘learning disability’) manifest at birth or during very early childhood.
They pervade into adulthood, and (in the UK) are often
diagnosed and managed by services separate from child

and adolescent psychiatry. Although the division is
somewhat arbitrary (and in practice involves a great degree of overlap with child and adolescent psychiatry),
intellectual disability is covered separately in this book
(Ch. 28).

DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
The developmental disorders are a heterogeneous group
of disorders whose defining characteristic is an impaired
acquisition of expected cognitive, motor, social or adaptive skills, due to abnormalities in the development of
the brain. The onset of these disorders is usually in infancy or early childhood and they tend to follow a
chronic, steady course (see Fig. 27.1).

Specific developmental disorders
These disorders are characterized by the disturbed acquisition of a specific cognitive or motor function during
a child’s development (e.g. language, reading, spelling,
arithmetical ability and motor skills). Other areas of
cognitive functioning are normal, therefore a child
may have a specific reading disorder (developmental
dyslexia) but be of normal intelligence and have no
problem with writing or mathematics. These disorders
are thought to arise from a specific biological abnormality in cognitive processing, rather than a lack of opportunity to learn, sensory impairment or neurological
disease. In some children, the consequences of the difficulty (e.g. school problems, teasing) might lead to secondary emotional or behavioural problems.

Pervasive developmental disorders
The pervasive developmental disorders are characterized by:
• Severe impairments in social interactions and communication skills.
• Restricted, stereotyped interests and behaviours.
These behavioural abnormalities pervade all areas of
functioning and are usually evident within the first
few years of life. While often associated with intellectual
disabilities, this is not always the case. The diagnosis is
made on the basis of abnormalities of behaviour, social
interactions and communication skills rather than intellectual functioning. The pervasive developmental
disorders include autism, Asperger’s syndrome, Rett’s
syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. The
term autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is often used as
an umbrella term to cover all pervasive developmental
disorders including those that do not exactly meet diagnostic criteria. The use of the term ASD recognizes a

27

continuum of disability, and that boundaries between
different syndromes are often difficult to decipher.

Autism (childhood autism, autistic
disorder)
Diagnosis and clinical features
The three characteristic features of autism manifest
within the first 3 years of life and include:
1. Impairment in social interaction as evidenced by the
poor use of non-verbal behaviours (e.g. eye contact,
facial expression, gestures) and a failure to develop
and share in the enjoyment of peer relationships.
2. Impairment in communication as evidenced by poor
development of spoken language; extreme difficulty
in initiating or sustaining conversation; repetitive
use of idiosyncratic language and lack of imitative
or make-believe play.
3. Restricted, stereotyped interests and behaviours as evidenced by intense preoccupations with interests
such as dates, phone numbers and timetables; inflexible adherence to routines and rituals; repetitive,
stereotyped motor movements such as clapping,
rocking or twisting and an unusual interest in parts
of hard or moving objects.
In addition to these diagnostic features, patients may also
exhibit behavioural problems such as aggressiveness,
impulsivity and self-injurious behaviour. Although autistic children can be of normal intelligence, 75% have significant intellectual disabilities. Epilepsy may develop in
about 25–30% of cases.

Epidemiology and aetiology
• The prevalence of classical autism in the general population is about 1 per 1000 children.
• The male-to-female ratio is approximately 4:1.
• The exact cause of autism has not been clarified but
genetic, prenatal, perinatal and immunological factors have been implicated. Phenylketonuria, tuberous sclerosis and congenital rubella are associated
conditions.
• While autism remains a separate diagnostic entity to
schizophrenia, social withdrawal, communication
impairment and poor eye contact seen in autism
are similar to the negative symptoms seen in schizophrenia. Evidence is currently emerging that the
two disorders share a number of genetic factors. It
may be clinically difficult to differentiate highfunctioning autistic spectrum disorder from schizoid
personality disorder or schizotypal disorder, which
may also suggest a genetic link to schizophrenia.
• There is no good evidence to support the claim that
the MMR vaccine (mumps, measles, rubella) results
in autism.

187

Child and adolescent psychiatry
Management and prognosis
• Prognosis is poor: only 1–2% achieve full independence; 20–30% achieve partial independence.
• Children with autism who have IQs above 70 and
those who have good language development by
age 5–7 have the best prognosis.
• Prognosis is improved if the home environment is
supportive – family education and support are crucial.
• Management approaches are similar to those used in
patients with intellectual disability (Ch. 28).

Asperger’s syndrome
Asperger’s syndrome is similar to autism in that there is
impairment in reciprocal social interaction coupled
with restricted, stereotyped interests and behaviours.
However, there are no significant abnormalities in language acquisition and ability, or in cognitive development and intelligence. Indeed, IQ and language may
be superior in some cases. Abnormalities may be more
obvious in the early years, and difficulties in later childhood and adolescence tend to be in the domain of social interaction. Asperger’s syndrome is far more
prevalent in males. Due to under-recognition, prevalence may be as high as 3 in 1000. Family history of autism and mild motor clumsiness may be present.
Figure 27.2 summarizes the differences between autism and Asperger’s syndrome.

Rett’s syndrome (disorder)
Rett’s syndrome, which has almost only been seen in
girls, is caused by mutations in the gene MECP2 located
on the X chromosome, and can arise sporadically or

from germline mutations. It is initially characterized
by an apparently normal antenatal development with
a normal head circumference at birth, followed by an
apparently normal psychomotor development in the
first 5 months after birth. From 6 months to 2 years
of age, a progressive and destructive encephalopathy
results in a deceleration of head growth; loss or lack
of development of language, and loss of purposeful
hand movements and fine motor skills, with subsequent development of stereotyped hand movements
(e.g. midline hand-wringing). After a decade, most girls
are bound to a wheelchair with incontinence, muscle
wasting and rigidity and almost no language ability.

Childhood disintegrative disorder (Heller’s
syndrome)
This disorder, which is more common in boys, is characterized by about 2 years of normal development, followed by a loss of previously acquired skills (language,
social and adaptive skills, play, bowel and bladder control and motor skills) before age 10. It is also associated
with an autism-like impairment of social interaction as
well as repetitive, stereotyped interests and mannerisms.
Thus, after the deterioration, these children may resemble autistic children.

ACQUIRED DISORDERS
The acquired disorders of childhood are illnesses ‘superimposed’ on a relatively normally developing child, implying that if the illness were ‘removed’, a more or less
normally developed child would remain. They tend to
follow a fluctuating course and are often amenable to
treatment. Acquired disorders can further be divided
into those disorders developing specifically in childhood and the ‘adult’ psychiatric disorders that have their
onset in childhood (see Fig. 27.1).

Acquired disorders with onset
usually in childhood or
adolescence
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(hyperkinetic disorder)
Diagnosis and clinical features
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is described in the DSM-IV. Hyperkinetic disorder is similarly described in ICD-10. Although it is described as
an acquired disorder in current classification systems,
ADHD is now considered by most to be a highly
heritable neurodevelopmental disorder with a genetic

Acquired disorders
contribution to variance in liability of around 76%. It
usually manifests before the age of 7 and is characterized by: (1) impaired attention; (2) hyperactivity and/or
impulsivity:
1. Impaired attention includes: difficulty sustaining
attention in work or play tasks; not listening when
being spoken to; being highly distractible – moving
from one activity to another; reluctance to engage in
activities that require a sustained mental effort (e.g.
schoolwork); and being forgetful or regularly losing
things.
2. Hyperactivity includes: restlessness; incessant fidgeting; running and jumping around in inappropriate
situations; excessive talkativeness or noisiness; and
difficulty engaging in quiet activities. Impulsivity includes: difficulty awaiting turn; interrupting others’
conversations or games; and prematurely blurting
out answers to questions.
These symptoms should be evident in more than one
situation (e.g. at school and at home), and should have
been present for at least 6 months.
It is important to distinguish ADHD from:
• Age-appropriate behaviours in young active children. ADHD is usually not recognized until the child
has started school because of the normal variation of
behaviours in preschool children. However, ADHD
is diagnosed and treated in clear cases in young
children.
• Children placed in academic settings inappropriate
to their intellectual ability. This includes children
with intellectual disabilities and highly intelligent
children in an under-stimulating environment.
• Other mental illnesses (e.g. pervasive developmental
disorders, depression, etc.).
Diagnosis should only be made by a specialist psychiatrist, paediatrician or other professional with expertise
in the diagnosis of ADHD. This diagnosis should be
based on a full clinical and psychosocial assessment,
including developmental history, assessment of impairment, observer reports and mental state examination.

27

probably due to the narrower diagnostic criteria of
the ICD-10’s hyperkinetic disorder.
• The male-to-female ratio is approximately 3:1.
• Genetic studies have shown that ADHD has one of
the highest heritabilities of all psychiatric illnesses.
Manifestation of symptoms is likely to be due to
gene–environment interactions, with pre- and perinatal factors, and psychosocial factors (prolonged
emotional deprivation, diet) also implicated.

Management and prognosis
Pharmacological management is indicated as first-line
treatment in school-age children with severe ADHD.
The central nervous system (CNS) stimulant methylphenidate (Ritalin®, Concerta®, Equasym®) is normally
tried in the first instance. Atomoxetine (Strattera®) and
dexamfetamine are also licensed in the UK for the management of ADHD: these tend to be used in cases where
methylphenidate is ineffective or poorly tolerated. The
use of stimulant medication can be helpful in up to
three-quarters of cases, improving ability to sustain attention and academic efficiency. In treatment resistant
cases, the (unlicensed) use of bupropion, clonidine,
modafinil and imipramine may be considered; however, this should only be done following referral to a
tertiary centre. Antipsychotics are not recommended
for the management of ADHD.
Psychosocial interventions are recommended in all
cases, and are used first-line in children with mild to
moderate ADHD, and in all preschool children. The
choice of treatment naturally depends on the developmental stage of the child or adolescent. Useful strategies
may include: parental education or training; cognitivebehavioural therapy; and social skills training.
Improvement usually occurs with development, and
remission of symptoms often occurs between the ages of
12 and 20. Unstable family dynamics and coexisting
conduct disorder are associated with a worse prognosis.
Around 15% of patients have symptoms persisting into
later life and may require ongoing management from
adult mental health services.

HINTS AND TIPS
Restlessness, overactivity, impaired concentration and
inattention may also arise in children with agitated
depression or anxiety. ADHD should not be diagnosed
in these cases unless there is clear evidence that these
symptoms were present before, or persist after the
resolution of, the depression or anxiety.

Epidemiology and aetiology
• The prevalence of ADHD in the USA is 3–7% in
school-age children. It is about 1% in the UK,

COMMUNICATION
Parents’ concerns need to be addressed as well as the
patient’s. Treatment of ADHD has received much
media interest, especially potential side-effects – be
aware of this. Methylphenidate is associated with
growth suppression with prolonged use. It is only
prescribed in specialist settings with regular weight and
height monitoring. Drug holidays can be used to allow
children to make up growth gains.

189

Child and adolescent psychiatry

Conduct disorder
The onset of conduct disorder is usually before the age
of 18. Most affected boys meet the criteria by age 10–12
years and most affected girls by age 14–16 years. The
disorder is characterized by a repetitive and persistent
pattern of: aggression to people and animals; destruction of property (including fire-setting); deceitfulness
or theft; and major violations of age-appropriate societal expectations or rules (e.g. truancy, staying out at
night, running away from home). Prevalence estimates
vary from 1% to 10%; however, rates among populations in young offenders institutions have been estimated to be as high as 87%. The male-to-female ratio
is approximately 4:1. Aetiological factors include genetics, parental psychopathology (mental illness, substance abuse, antisocial personality traits), child abuse
and neglect, poor socioeconomic status and educational
impairment. Many adolescents improve by adulthood;
however, a substantial proportion go on to develop antisocial personality disorder and substance-related
problems, especially those with an early age of onset.
Management strategies include behaviour, cognitive,
family and group therapy.
Oppositional defiant disorder describes a persistent
pattern of negativistic, defiant, hostile and disruptive
behaviour in the absence of behaviour that violates the
law or the basic rights of others as occurs in conduct disorder (e.g. theft, cruelty, bullying, assault). Children
with this disorder deliberately defy requests or rules,
are angry and resentful and annoy others on purpose.
HINTS AND TIPS
It helps to remember that family histories should relate
to both genetic lineage and factors that influence
psychological development: the risk of developing
conduct disorder is increased if a first-degree relative
suffers from it, but also if there is a history of antisocial
personality disorder in a close family member,
regardless of whether they are a biological relative.

Emotional disorders
The emotional disorders in childhood are often thought
to be exaggerations of normal developmental trends
rather than discrete illnesses in themselves. They rarely
persist into adulthood, and tend to have a good prognosis. The treatment of these disorders is focused on behavioural and family therapy.

Separation anxiety disorder
Normal separation anxiety usually occurs in children
from 6 months to 2 years. However, some children experience inappropriate and excessive anxiety about

190

separation from attachment figures. This disorder is
only diagnosed when the anxiety is of such a severity
that it is markedly different from other children of a
similar age or when it persists beyond the usual age period (e.g. a 6-year-old girl becoming incredibly distressed when her mother drops her off at school).

Phobic anxiety disorder
Minor phobic symptoms are common in childhood, and
the object of the phobia varies with developmental stage
(e.g. fear of animals or monsters in preschool children).
Phobic anxiety disorder is diagnosed when the phobic
object is age-inappropriate (e.g. a 9-year-old boy who is
afraid of monsters under the bed), or where levels of
anxiety are clinically abnormal. Non-developmental
phobias (e.g. agoraphobia) do not fall under this category,
but under the adult phobia category (see Chs. 10 and 20).

Social anxiety disorder
Normal stranger anxiety occurs in well-adjusted children
from 8 months to 1 year. Social anxiety disorder is a persistent and recurrent fear and/or avoidance of strangers.
This disorder is only diagnosed when the anxiety is of such
a severity that it is markedly different from other children
of a similar age or when it persists beyond the usual age
period.

Sibling rivalry disorder
Minor emotional disturbance or jealousy is normal after
the birth of a sibling. However, when the levels of jealousy or rivalry become excessive or persistent, sibling rivalry disorder can be diagnosed.
HINTS AND TIPS
School refusal is the refusal to go to school because of
anxiety in spite of parental pressure. It may be caused
by separation anxiety (younger children), another
mental illness (e.g. depression, social phobia), or
negative psychosocial factors (e.g. bullying, teasing).
Truancy, on the other hand, is an absence from
school by choice and is associated with conduct
disorder, poor academic performance,
family history of antisocial behaviour and large
family size.

Other disorders with onset usually
in childhood or adolescence
Elective mutism (selective mutism)
Elective mutism is a selectivity in vocal communication
depending on the social circumstances. The child speaks
normally in some situations (e.g. at home), but is
mute in others (e.g. at school). These children have

Acquired disorders
adequately developed language comprehension and
ability (although a minority may have slight speech delay or articulation problems). It usually presents before
the age of 5, is slightly more common in girls, and is associated with psychological stress, social anxiety and
oppositional behaviour.

Tic disorders
Tics are sudden, repetitive, non-rhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. They are involuntary; however,
they can be voluntarily suppressed (although this can be
very difficult). Tics often become more prominent during times of stress. Tics are divided into:
• Simple motor tics (e.g. eye-blinking, neck-jerking,
facial grimacing).
• Simple vocal tics (e.g. grunting, coughing, barking,
sniffing).
• Complex motor tics (e.g. jumping, touching self,
copropraxia (use of obscene gestures)).
• Complex vocal tics (senseless repetition of words,
coprolalia (use of obscene words or phrases)).

Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome
More commonly known simply as ‘Tourette’s syndrome’, this is characterized by the presence of both
multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics for
more than 1 year. The motor tics usually present by
age 7 years, although tics can present as early as 2 years
of age. Obsessions and compulsions (OCD) and attention difficulties and impulsivity (ADHD) are associated
conditions (see p. 87 and 188). Drug treatment is not always required: cognitive behavioural therapy and other
psychosocial interventions can be used to help manage
the anxiety that aggravates tics, and treatment of comorbid ADHD or OCD (with medication and/or psychotherapy) can be effective. However, if tics persist, dopamine
antagonists can be helpful (haloperidol is licensed, but
pimozide, clonidine and sulpiride have been effective).
Risk of side-effects should always be balanced against
benefits on an individual basis.

Non-organic enuresis
This condition is characterized by the involuntary voiding of urine in children who, according to their developmental stage, should have established consistent
bladder control (therefore ordinarily not diagnosed before the age of 5). It may occur during the day or night
and is not directly caused by any medical condition (e.g.
seizures, diabetes, urinary tract infection, structural abnormalities of the urinary tract) or use of a substance
(e.g. diuretic). Two types of enuresis have been described: primary enuresis means that urinary continence
has never been established; and secondary enuresis

27

means that continence has been achieved in the past.
Non-organic enuresis occurs in around 7% of 5-yearolds; 4% of 10-year-olds; and around 1% of adolescents
older than the age of 15 years. Gender distribution is
equal in younger patients; however, cases that persist
into adolescence tend to be males. Aetiological factors
include genetics, developmental delays, psychosocial
stressors (moving house, birth of a sibling, start or
change of school, divorce, bereavement) and inadequate toilet training. About 75% of children with
non-organic enuresis have a first-degree biological relative who has had the same problem. Management involves exclusion of physical cause, parental education
about toilet training (especially in primary enuresis),
behavioural therapy (padand buzzer apparatus, starchart,
bladder training), and – as a last resort – pharmacotherapy
(imipramine, nasal desmopressin). Most cases of nonorganic enuresis resolve by adolescence.

Non-organic encopresis
This condition is characterized by the deposition of normal faeces (i.e. not diarrhoea) in inappropriate places, in
children who – according to their developmental stage –
should have established consistent bowel control (therefore ordinarily not diagnosed before the age of 4). It may
be due to unsuccessful toilet training where bowel control has never been achieved (primary encopresis), or
may occur after a period of normal bowel control (secondary encopresis). Encopresis may result from a developmental delay, coercive or punitive potty training,
emotional, physical or sexual abuse, a disturbed parent–
child relationship, parental marital conflict, or can feature
as a symptom of another psychiatric disturbance (e.g.
autism). About 1% of 5-year-olds have the condition
and it is more common in males. Management includes
ruling out an organic cause (constipation with overflow
incontinence, anal fissure, gastrointestinal infection),
assessing and treating disturbed family dynamics (ruling
out child abuse), parental guidance regarding toilet training and behaviour therapy (e.g. star chart). Stool softeners
may be used for constipation. The prognosis is good with
90% of cases improving within a year.

‘Adult’ disorders with onset in
childhood
All psychiatric disorders that usually present in adulthood can also develop in childhood (e.g. affective
disorders, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, substance-related problems), although many (such as
schizophrenia) are much rarer in childhood than adulthood. The diagnostic criteria are essentially the same as
for adults (see relevant chapters).

191

Child and adolescent psychiatry
COMMUNICATION
It is useful to broaden the frame of questions used
when taking a history from (or about) a child. For
example, depression may present with irritability and
failure to meet expected weight and growth gains
rather than with low mood and weight loss.

CHILD ABUSE
Child abuse includes the overlapping concepts of physical, sexual and emotional mistreatment, as well as neglect or deprivation of the child. Figure 27.3 lists the risk
factors associated with child abuse. In addition to the
physical manifestations, victims of abuse may present
with failure to thrive and symptoms of depression, anxiety, aggression, age-inappropriate sexual behaviour
and self-harm. They are also at an increased risk for
the development of a substantial range of psychiatric
problems in later life.
All NHS Trusts in the UK have specific child protection guidelines which should be easily accessible and
consulted before they are needed. All healthcare staff
(not just child psychiatrists and paediatricians) have a
duty to protect children from harm, and the safety of
a child should always take priority. If a child discloses
abuse (of any sort), or if you suspect that they are
being abused or neglected, confidentiality cannot be

maintained, and this should (if appropriate) be
explained to the child. Comprehensive notes should
be kept, and care taken to allow the child to make the
disclosure in their own words without suggestion from
others (either family or healthcare staff). Concerns
should be reported as soon as practically possible.
While local procedures vary slightly, the police, social
work, and the duty paediatrician should be able to
offer guidance. In some cases, the child may be in imminent danger (e.g. being taken home by the alleged perpetrator). It may be necessary to involve the police to
prevent further harm and to remove the child to a
place of safety.

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The nomenclature of intellectual disability
• The definition of intellectual disability, and its classification and diagnosis
• Epidemiology and the aetiological factors associated with intellectual disabilities
• Clinical features of intellectual disability
• Management strategies for patients with intellectual disabilities, including the role of prevention,
psychosocial care and medication

Many terms have been used in the past to describe people
with significantly lower than average intelligence. Initially,
terms such as ‘idiot’ and ‘imbecile’ were used. Subsequently, a number of further terms have been adopted,
and superseded after they have crept into colloquial language and gained negative connotations. While both the
ICD-10 and DSM-IV use the term ‘mental retardation’ to
describe people with intellectual impairment, this term is
now considered to be dated. Until recently, the term ‘learning disability’ was preferred in the UK, although this has recently been superseded by the term ‘intellectual disability’.
The latter term will be used for the purposes of this chapter.

INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY
(MENTAL RETARDATION/
LEARNING DISABILITY)

Definition and diagnosis
Intellectual disability is an umbrella term used to describe
diverse afflictions which manifest as significant intellectual impairment associated with an impaired ability to
adapt to the normal demands of daily living, with onset
prior to the age of 18 years (but normally in the very early
years). These disorders are generally caused by an interruption in the normal development of the brain, from various causes. Intellectual disability is a lifelong condition.
Adaptive functioning is a measure of how patients
cope with activities of living such as communication,
self-care, social skills, and academic and vocational
skills. This is assessed by a thorough developmental,
psychiatric and medical history from the patient’s parents and other care providers.
Intellectual functioning is usually defined by the intelligence quotient (IQ). This can be assessed by standardized intelligence tests (e.g. Wechsler Intelligence Scales
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00028-X

for Children – WISC). An IQ of 70 or below, which is
two standard deviations below the mean (IQ ¼ 100), is
said to represent sub-average intellectual functioning. It
is important to remember the limitations of using standardized testing instruments. Many standardized tests
tend to be aimed at people of (or around) average intelligence, and therefore may be unsuitable for patients with
more severe difficulties. Also, differences in native language and background, as well as sensory, motor or communication difficulties may lead to patients obtaining
falsely low IQ scores. Therefore, patients obtaining IQ
scores lower than 70 should not be diagnosed as having
intellectual disability if there is no evidence of
significant impairments in adaptive functioning.
HINTS AND TIPS
Whereas dementia describes a loss of cognitive ability
already acquired, intellectual disability describes the
failure to develop a normal level of cognitive
functioning in the first place. Note, however, that
individuals with Down’s syndrome are also at very high
risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease in later life.

COMMUNICATION
The terms intellectual disability and learning difficulty
are often confused. A learning difficulty refers in general
to any condition that impairs learning and is most often
not associated with a global reduction in IQ. A specific
learning difficulty is one particular problem which
impairs learning (e.g. dyslexia, dyscalculia). Intellectual
disabilities are often associated with learning difficulties.

193

Intellectual disability

Classification and clinical features
The ICD-10 specifies intellectual disabilities (under the
term ‘mental retardation’) as mild, moderate, severe and
profound, according to the degree of intellectual and
adaptive impairment. Figure 28.1 summarizes the clinical
features of the degrees of intellectual disabilities; however,
note that this is simplified and that difficulties experienced
can vary from person to person. In addition to the impairment of adaptive functioning, patients may have clinical
features associated with the specific cause of their intellectual disability (e.g. Down’s syndrome: epicanthic folds
with oblique palpebral fissures, broad hands with single
transverse palmar crease, flattened occiput, cardiac septal
defects). Other features associated with intellectual disabilities include aggression, self-injurious behaviours, repetitive stereotypical motor movements and poor
impulse control. Up to a third of people with an intellectual disability have a comorbid psychiatric illness, most
commonly schizophrenia (4%), which occurs at a higher
rate in individuals with learning disabilities than in the
population in general.

a third of patients with mild intellectual disabilities, and
this may suggest that they represent the lower end of a
normal distribution curve for intellectual functioning.
Specific causes, however, are more likely to be found
in patients with severe or profound intellectual disabilities. Remember that intellectual disability is a descriptive term and can still be used regardless of whether
patients have a specific psychiatric or physical cause
for their intellectual impairment or not (e.g. autism,
Down’s syndrome). Figure 28.2 lists the potential
identifiable causes of intellectual disability.

HINTS AND TIPS
The DSM-IV uses a multi-axial diagnostic system that
separates Axis I conditions (major mental illnesses,
e.g. psychotic and mood disorders), Axis II conditions
(personality disorders and intellectual disabilities –
referred to as ‘mental retardation’) and Axis III conditions
(general medical conditions), so that all three areas
potentially requiring clinical attention are considered.

Epidemiology and aetiology
The prevalence of intellectual disabilities in the general
population is about 1–2%, with a male-to-female ratio
of approximately 3:2. Around 85% of all cases are considered to be mild (see Fig. 28.1), and many of these individuals may live alone with varying degrees of
support. No clear aetiology can be determined in at least

Management and prognosis
Prevention and detection
Primary prevention includes genetic screening and
counselling for higher risk groups, prenatal testing
(e.g. amniocentesis, rhesus incompatibility), improved

Genetic

Chromosomal: e.g. Down’s syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome
Other: e.g. phenylketonuria, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome,
Tay–Sachs disease, other enzyme deficiency diseases

Prenatal

Congenital infections: e.g. TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus,
herpes simples and zoster (chicken pox)), also syphilis and acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS)
Substance use during pregnancy: e.g. fetal alcohol syndrome, prescribed drugs with
teratogenic effects
Complications of pregnancy: e.g. pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation,
antepartum haemorrhage

Perinatal

Birth trauma: e.g. intracranial haemorrhage, hypoxia
Prematurity: e.g. intraventricular haemorrhage, hyperbilirubinaemia (kernicterus), infections

Environmental

perinatal and neonatal care, and early detection of metabolic abnormalities that may contribute to intellectual
impairment (e.g. phenylketonuria, neonatal hypothyroidism). Milder intellectual disabilities may be less obvious, and early detection requires the ability of teachers
and family doctors to be able to identify difficulties as
soon as possible. Secondary prevention aims to prevent
the progression of disability, by providing compensatory education and early attempts to reduce behavioural
problems. If you suspect a child has an intellectual disability, this should be discussed with either a paediatrician or a child and adolescent mental health specialist,
who will be able to provide guidance on local services. If
you suspect an adult has an undiagnosed mild intellectual disability, this should be discussed with the local
intellectual disabilities team, who may suggest an initial
referral for neuropsychological assessment.

Help for families
Families require information, advice, and both psychological and practical support from the time that the diagnosis is first made. Adequate time should be devoted
to this, and should aim to involve the parents in helping
their child achieve their full potential. Support should
be ongoing, and should focus on education, practical
matters and psychological support. This may need to
be increased at the more challenging times, such as
puberty, starting or leaving school, times of stress (e.g.
bereavement or illness), and the transition to adult
services.

Education, training and occupation
If the needs of a child with intellectual disability can be
met by mainstream education, this should be encouraged due to the benefits of societal integration and
mutual understanding. However, many children with intellectual disabilities have complex needs that are best
addressed in specialist schools. Later, vocational guidance should be offered: most people with mild intellectual disabilities are able to take mainstream or supported
employment (e.g. Remploy).

Housing and social support
Most people with mild intellectual disabilities are able
to live independently, with varying degrees of social
and familial support. Assessment of tasks of daily living
will be necessary to ensure that people are appropriately
placed. For people with more severe difficulties, residential care may be necessary. In such cases, development of
social skills should be encouraged as far as is practical.

Medical care
People with intellectual disabilities should have the
same access to medical services as everyone else, although
communication difficulties and false attribution of symptoms to the intellectual disability (diagnostic overshadowing) mean care is often suboptimal. See Figure 28.3
for considerations of aspects of communication when
assessing an individual with an intellectual disability.
Extra medical care is often required due to comorbidities

195

Intellectual disability
Fig. 28.3 Communication considerations in intellectual disability

Allow extra time
Speak first to the person with the intellectual disability, not their carer
Assess their understanding early and involve them as much as possible
Ask short, simple questions
Use literal, direct language, not abstract or medical terms (e.g. ‘Does it hurt when you pee?’, rather than ‘How are your
waterworks?’, or ‘Do you experience dysuria?’)

such as physical disability or epilepsy. Many general hospitals have specialist nurses who are experienced in the
management of individuals with intellectual disabilities
admitted for medical treatment or surgery.

Psychiatric care
Given the higher prevalence of comorbid mental illness in
this group, people with intellectual disabilities should have
access to specialist care (usually on an out-patient, community or day-patient basis) as and when required. Because
the assessment and management of psychiatric illness
and behavioural disturbances in individuals with intellectual disability can be difficult, most areas have multidisciplinary specialist teams. These teams can address
not only major mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depression), but can also help manage autism and challenging behaviours. Psychotropic
medication may be indicated; however, given the common
difficulties with unusual presentations, polypharmacy,
comorbidities and sensitivity to medication, there should
be a low threshold for seeking advice from, or referral to, a
specialist doctor. Behavioural therapy may be useful in the
management of maladaptive or otherwise difficult behaviours (e.g. self-injury, aggression, destructiveness).

196

HINTS AND TIPS
Epilepsy is a common comorbidity in individuals with
intellectual disabilities, and can often complicate
assessment and management. Remember that a
number of different psychotropic medications can
lower seizure threshold, and that ‘mood stabilizers’
(with the exception of lithium) are antiepileptic
medications.

COMMUNICATION
Collateral histories are invaluable when assessing
someone with an intellectual disability. When a change
in behaviour occurs, it is useful to ask about what else
has changed in the patient’s life or their daily routine.
However, the prevalence of other psychiatric disorders
is three to four times higher and so these must be
excluded.

Forensic psychiatry

29

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The association between mental illness and crime
• Which psychiatric disorders are associated with violent crime
• The similarities and differences between antisocial personality disorder, dissocial personality disorder
and psychopathy
• The methods used to predict violence
• Factors associated with a future risk of violence
• The link between mental disorders, culpability for alleged offences and associated legal defences

Forensic psychiatry, in its narrowest sense, is concerned
with assessment and treatment of mentally disordered
offenders as well as the assessment of the dangerousness
of individuals who may not yet have committed an
offence. In practice, forensic psychiatric services tend
to assess and manage those who pose a high risk to
the safety of others. Some patients may be managed
in the community; however, others may require treatment and rehabilitation in a secure environment. Levels
of security can vary from a locked ward in a psychiatric
hospital to a maximum security ‘special hospital’
(Broadmoor, Rampton or Ashworth Hospital, or The
State Hospital in Scotland).

HINTS AND TIPS
Mental disorders associated with violent crime
(personality disorders, alcohol and substance
dependence, and paranoid psychotic disorders) have
a multiplicative effect for the risk of future violence
when they occur in combination.

HINTS AND TIPS
Delusional jealousy (Othello’s syndrome) is often
associated with alcohol abuse and linked to violent
crime such as assault and homicide.

MENTAL DISORDER AND CRIME
The vast majority of patients suffering from a mental
illness have never committed an offence, and most
offences are not committed by people with a mental
illness. Indeed, a recent study showed that patients with
mental disorders were four times more likely to fall
victim to violence than members of the general population. However, there is a significantly higher prevalence
of mental disorders among prisoners than in the general
population: in the UK, it is estimated that 66% of prisoners have a personality disorder; 45% are dependent
on illicit drugs; 30% are dependent on alcohol; and
45% have a neurotic disorder (depression or anxiety).
Around 10% of prisoners may have some form of psychotic disorder, and between 20% and 30% are thought
to have an intellectual disability that adversely affects
their ability to cope with incarceration. Figure 29.1 describes the crimes associated with these disorders.

Personality disorder and crime
The German clinician Koch first used the term ‘psychopathy’ in 1891. At that time, it included all forms of personality disorder. However, the term was later used to
describe individuals who exhibited antisocial behaviour. Unfortunately, the term ‘psychopathic personality’
and the related term ‘psychopath’ have been misused in
both the medical and tabloid press. They were, for the
most part, superseded by the term sociopathic personality disorder for a time and subsequently by the favoured,
and currently used term, antisocial personality disorder
(see Ch. 16). However, it should be noted that the DSMIV criteria for antisocial personality disorder is largely
based on past behaviour. ICD-10’s dissocial personality
disorder includes more cognitive factors (e.g. lack of
guilt, callousness, inability to learn from punishment),
with psychopathy possibly representing an extreme

197

Forensic psychiatry
Fig. 29.1 Mental disorders associated with crime

Mental disorder

Associations with crime

Personality disorder

Associated with violent crime, especially antisocial personality disorder. Antisocial and
borderline personality disorders are frequently diagnosed in forensic settings, often in
association with comorbid substance abuse

Alcohol and
substance use

Substance misuse is one of the key factors that significantly increases the risk of violence,
especially in those with comorbid mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia). Alcohol intoxication may
also lead to driving offences and public drunkenness, and offences may be committed to fund
drug habits

Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia increases the risk of violent acts by a factor of four. Many offences committed by
people with schizophrenia are minor and are manifestations of impaired social skills. More
people with schizophrenia are victims of crime than perpetrators

Mood disorders

Depression is associated with shoplifting and, in rare cases, homicide. These cases are usually
due to mood-congruent delusions (e.g. everyone would be better off dead) and are often
followed by suicide. Postnatal depression is sometimes a cause of maternal filicide. Offences by
manic patients usually reflect financial irresponsibility or acts of aggression, which are usually
not serious

Intellectual
disabilities

There is an association between intellectual disabilities and sexual offences (especially indecent
exposure), as well as arson

subtype of this. It may therefore be useful to think of
these diagnoses as being an overlapping continuum,
with antisocial personality at the milder end and psychopathy at the more severe end.
Psychopathy is now narrowly defined by the Hare
Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PCL-R), and is not a
recognized diagnosis in either DSM-IV or ICD-10. It is
characterized, in part, by antisocial behaviour and emotional impairment, such as the diminished capacity for
guilt or remorse. Psychopathy is not synonymous with
antisocial personality disorder as only a third of individuals diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder
meet the criteria for psychopathy.
The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in
offenders and prison populations is significantly higher
than the general population, with around 14% of male
and 20% of female prisoners meeting diagnostic criteria.
Reasons may include the impulsiveness characteristic of
borderline personality disorder, the presence of comorbid antisocial personality disorder and the high prevalence of substance misuse disorders in these patients.
HINTS AND TIPS
The term ‘dangerous severe personality disorder’
(DSPD) is a political (rather than a clinical) term to
describe ‘individuals from whom the public at present
are not properly protected, and who are restrained
effectively neither by the criminal law, nor by the
provisions of the Mental Health Act’. DSPD is a
controversial concept, about which a number of
psychiatrists have expressed concern.

198

ASSESSING AND MANAGING
RISK OF VIOLENCE
The key principle in assessing the risk of violence that a
patient with a mental disorder poses to others poses
an ethical conflict between protecting the community
from a potentially violent offender and respecting
the human rights of the individual in question (see
Ch. 4). This is often a very difficult balance to achieve.
Forensic multidisciplinary teams in the UK have moved
from simply trying to predict the risk of future violence
(generally unsuccessful), to looking at the evidencebased risk factors present in an individual patient. This
enables a formulation of scenarios in which future violence would be more likely to occur, facilitating the creation of management plans which will decrease the
risk in a proactive fashion. Approaches to assessment
include:
• Unaided clinical risk assessment: this involves
drawing on the experience of the clinician involved.
This has been demonstrated to be associated with a
less effective and less accurate risk assessment than
evidence-based methods.
• Actuarial methods: assessment using predetermined static actuarial or statistical variables (e.g. demographic factors). These methods do not take into
account the specific factors of the case, and – used in
isolation – can be misleading.
• Structured clinical judgement: assessment utilizing
both empirical actuarial knowledge and clinical expertise. The Historical/Clinical/Risk Management
20-item (HCR-20) scale is by far the predominant

mode of risk assessment used in the UK, and is particularly useful in assisting with risk management.
Some newer tools have been developed that take
protective factors significantly into account.
Figure 29.2 summarizes some of the factors that have
been associated with the risk of violence.
A clinician confronted with an individual who
poses a serious risk of violent behaviour will need to
discuss the case with colleagues, including social
workers and forensic mental health specialists. Compulsory hospitalization may be required in some cases.
Clinicians have a duty to breach confidentiality to
warn potential victims of serious threats that have been
made (in consultation with the police), as per the Tarasoff ruling.

COMMUNICATION
A past history of violent behaviour is the best predictor
of future violent behaviour. It is important to both ask
the patient about this, and to seek verification from
other sources (police, social work, medical records).

CONSIDERATIONS IN COURT
PROCEEDINGS
Where there are grounds to believe that the accused
may have been suffering (or is currently suffering) from
a mental disorder, a psychiatric defence may be used.
A psychiatric defence means that the presence of mental
disorder may have been a mitigating factor in the offence
or may interfere with court proceedings. Throughout the
UK, this is mainly based on case law rather than legislation. The role of the forensic psychiatrist is to act as an
expert witness to the court. While the psychiatrist can

make recommendations, the ultimate decision comes
from the court.

Fitness to plead
Individuals with mental disorder are not exempt from
taking responsibility for their actions. However, defendants should be competent to stand trial and
mount a defence against their charges. The term ‘fitness to plead’ is used in English law to describe this
capacity. Using psychiatric and/or psychological evidence, the court determines this by assessing whether
the accused can:
• Understand the difference between a plea of guilty
and not guilty.
• Understand the nature of the charge.
• Instruct counsel (legal representation).
• Follow the evidence brought before the court.
• Challenge a juror.

Criminal responsibility
Before a defendant can be convicted, criminal responsibility needs to be determined. It should be determined
whether, at the time of the offence, the person was able
to control their own behaviour and choose whether to
commit an unlawful act or not. Integral to this process is
the concept of mens rea (‘guilty intent’ or ‘guilty mind’),
which means that the individual realized the nature of,
and intended to commit the unlawful act. Varying levels
of mens rea are recognized, known as ‘modes of culpability’. Actus reus (‘guilty act’ or ‘crime’) means the
person is guilty of committing the act, whatever their
intent. A defendant may be deemed to have decreased
criminal culpability due to:
• Age: in England and Wales, children are only deemed
legally responsible for their actions after the age of
14 years. Children under the age of 10 years are

199

Forensic psychiatry
deemed incapable of criminal intent (dolci incapax).
Children aged 10–14 years are not considered criminally responsible unless the prosecution can prove
mens rea.
• Reason of insanity: in English law, legal insanity (not a
psychiatric term) is defined in terms of the M’Naghten
Rules, which state that: ‘at the time of committing the act,
the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as to not know the nature and
quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he
did not know what he was doing was wrong.’ It is a defence
that is rarely successful due to the high threshold of the
legal definition of insanity.
• Diminished responsibility: in English law, a defence
of diminished responsibility is only available in relation to charges for murder. If successful, this will
lead to the accused being found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder, which allows for flexible sentencing (murder carries a mandatory life sentence).
It depends upon the presence of: ‘an abnormality of
mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury)’. An ‘abnormality of mind’
is not a psychiatric term and is open to wide interpretation, leading to successful defences such as ‘emotional immaturity’ and ‘premenstrual tension’.

200

• Automatism: an act committed without presence of
mind (e.g. during sleepwalking or epileptic seizure)
may warrant this rare defence.

HINTS AND TIPS
Self-induced (‘voluntary’) intoxication with alcohol or
other drugs cannot be used as a defence on the
grounds of insanity or diminished responsibility.

HINTS AND TIPS
It is the responsibility of the Court (taking into
consideration advice from expert witnesses) to decide
upon sentencing or ‘disposal’ (i.e. what happens to the
individual after trial). In cases where psychiatric
defences are successfully used, the Court may utilize
mental health legislation to transfer the individual to a
secure hospital. In other cases, the Court may decide to
impose a custodial sentence, or to place conditions
upon the individual (e.g. to adhere to a drug treatment
programme).

The sleep disorders

30

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• The differences between slow wave (stages 3 and 4) and REM sleep and their associated parasomnias
• The three main causes of secondary sleep disorders
• What non-pharmacological strategies may be used to treat primary insomnia
• The role of benzodiazepines in treating primary insomnia
• The four characteristic symptoms of narcolepsy
• How circadian rhythm sleep disorders cause hypersomnia
• The risk factors for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome
• How to distinguish between nightmares and night terrors (sleep terrors)

Sleeping is intimately related to mental health. Not only
can psychiatric illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia disturb the quantity and quality of sleep, but
certain psychiatric drugs can also have the same effect.
Furthermore, persistent primary sleep disturbances,
which are common, can result in significant psychological consequences in an otherwise mentally healthy
individual.

DEFINITIONS AND
CLASSIFICATION
Sleep is divided into five distinct stages as measured by
polysomnography (see later): four stages of non-rapid
eye movement (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4) and a rapid eye
movement stage (REM). Figure 30.1 summarizes the
key characteristics of the stages of sleep.
The DSM-IV organizes the sleep disorders into four
sections according to their causes:
1. Primary sleep disorders.
2. Sleep disorders secondary to another mental illness.
3. Sleep disorders secondary to another medical
condition.
4. Sleep disorders secondary to the use of a substance.
This chapter will focus principally on primary sleep disorders, which are not caused by another medical condition (e.g. arthritis) or mental illness (e.g. depression),
and do not occur secondary to the use of a substance
(e.g. alcohol). These disorders are presumed to arise
from some defect of an individual’s endogenous sleeping mechanism (the reticular activating system) coupled
with unhelpful learned behaviours (e.g. worrying about
not sleeping). The primary sleep disorders, in turn, are
divided into the dyssomnias and the parasomnias:
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00030-8

1. The dyssomnias are characterized by abnormalities
in the amount, quality or timing of sleep. They
include primary insomnia, primary hypersomnia,
narcolepsy, circadian rhythm sleep disorders and
breathing-related sleep disorders.
2. The parasomnias are characterized by abnormal
episodes that occur during sleep or sleep-wake transitions. They include nightmares, night terrors and
sleepwalking.

Insomnia
Insomnia describes sleep of insufficient quantity or
poor quality due to:
• Difficulty falling asleep.
• Frequent awakening during the course of sleep.
• Early morning awakening with subsequent difficulty
getting back to sleep.
• Sleep that is not refreshing despite being adequate in
length.
In addition to daytime tiredness, persistent insomnia
can have significant effects on mood, behaviour and
performance. It has been shown that insomnia can also
lead to an impairment of health-related quality of life
similar to congestive cardiac failure or depression.
HINTS AND TIPS
You may find it useful to think in terms of ‘altered sleep
patterns’ rather than of insomnia per se. While
common in depression, it is only early morning
wakening that is part of the somatic syndrome (see p.
50) and 20% will have atypical symptoms e.g. weight
gain, increased appetite and hypersomnia

Primary insomnia is diagnosed when present for at least
a month, and not attributable to medical or psychiatric
illness, substance misuse, or other dyssomnia or parasomnia. The numerous causes of insomnia as summarized in Figure 30.2 include primary sleep disorders,
medical and psychiatric illness and substance use.

202

Assessment of insomnia
Assessment involves excluding a medical, psychiatric or
substance-related cause of insomnia. Many cases of primary insomnia are related to poor sleep hygiene (see
Fig. 30.3). Therefore it is essential to enquire about
sleeping times and patterns, and caffeine consumption.

The following questions might be helpful in eliciting
the key symptoms of insomnia:
• Do you fall asleep quickly or do you find yourself tossing and turning for some time before dropping off?
Fig. 30.3 Correct sleep hygiene

• Avoid sleeping during the day
• Exercise during the day and maintain a healthy diet
• Eliminate the use of stimulants (e.g. caffeine, nicotine,
alcohol), especially around bedtime

• Condition the brain by only using the bed for sleeping
and sex – not for reading, watching TV, etc.

• Go to bed and awaken at the same time each day
• Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime (e.g.
television, games). Instead, engage in relaxation
techniques or reading
• Try having a hot bath or drinking a cup of warm milk
near bedtime
• Avoid large meals near bedtime
• Ensure that the bed is comfortable and that the bedroom is quiet
• Do not lie in bed awake for longer than 15 minutes.
Get up and do another relaxing activity and try
sleeping later

30

• Do you wake up repeatedly in the night or can you
sleep through once you have managed to get to
sleep?
• Do you sometimes awaken too early in the morning
and then find that you are unable to get back to
sleep?
• Is your sleep refreshing or do you still feel tired in the
morning?
In treatment-resistant cases it might be necessary to refer the patient to a sleep specialist for further investigation. Polysomnography is the simultaneous process
of monitoring various physical parameters during
sleep, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram, electrooculogram (eye movement), blood oxygen saturation,
chest and abdominal excursion, mouth and nose air
entry rates and the loudness of snoring.
COMMUNICATION
When considering insomnia, ask what the normal
amount of sleep is for the patient in order for them to
feel refreshed in the morning and what time they
normally wake up. There is significant individual
variation.

Management of primary insomnia
The most important aspect of management is providing
education about correct sleep hygiene (Fig. 30.3).
There is a limited role for medication in the treatment of primary insomnia. Hypnotics may help in
the short term, but the development of tolerance to their
effects (usually within 2 weeks), possible dependence,
and their propensity to cause rebound insomnia limit
their use. Therefore, they should only be prescribed
on a time-limited basis, ideally for use on alternate or
occasional nights rather than every night. Drugs with
a long half-life should be avoided, to prevent leaving patients feeling drowsy the next day (the ‘chemical hangover’), and to avoid accumulation with repeated doses.
Commonly used agents include the ‘Z-drugs’ (zopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon) and benzodiazepines with
a short half-life (such as temazepam). It may be useful
to consider the use of other sedative medications (e.g.
sedating antihistamines) with less potential for dependence or misuse.

Hypersomnia and narcolepsy
Hypersomnia describes excessive sleepiness that manifests as either a prolonged period of sleep or sleep episodes that occur during normal waking hours.
Primary hypersomnia is diagnosed when patients
present with hypersomnia for at least a month not

203

The sleep disorders
attributable to a medical or psychiatric condition, substance use, or other dyssomnia (especially narcolepsy
and sleep apnoea) or parasomnia.
Narcolepsy is due to an abnormality of the REMinhibiting mechanism and is characterized by a tetrad of:

includes taking forced naps at regular times. In some
cases, stimulants are needed to reduce daytime sleepiness; tricyclic antidepressants increase muscle tone
and may help to control cataplexy and sleep paralysis.

1. Irresistible attacks of refreshing sleep that may occur
at inappropriate times (e.g. driving).
2. Cataplexy (sudden, bilateral loss of muscle tone usually precipitated by intense emotion leading to collapse, and lasting for seconds to minutes).
3. Hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations (see
p. 67).
4. Sleep paralysis at the beginning or end of sleep
episodes.

Circadian rhythm sleep disorders

All four symptoms occur in less than 50% of cases and
the diagnosis is usually made with evidence of sleep attacks and cataplexy. Patients usually have 2–6 episodes
of sleep per day which usually last 10–20 minutes each.
Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations and the paralysis of voluntary muscles occur as a result of elements
of REM sleep intruding into the transition between
sleep and wakefulness. Other features may include persistent tiredness, and problems with memory and
concentration.
The numerous causes of hypersomnia as summarized in Figure 30.4 include primary sleep disorders,
medical and psychiatric illness, substance use and sleep
deprivation.
The treatment of primary hypersomnia is usually
with stimulants such as dexamphetamine, methylphenidate and modafanil. The treatment of narcolepsy

204

Circadian rhythm sleep disorder (sleep–wake schedule
disorder) is characterized by a lack of synchrony between an individual’s endogenous circadian rhythm
for sleep and that demanded by their environment,
resulting in their being tired when they should be awake
(hypersomnia) and being awake when they should be
sleeping (insomnia). This disorder results from either
a malfunction of the internal ‘biological clock’ that regulates sleep or from an unnatural environmental change
(e.g. jet lag, night-shift work).

Breathing-related sleep disorders
Abnormalities of ventilation during sleep can cause
repeated disruptions to sleep. This results in unrefreshing sleep and excessive sleepiness during the day.
Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, the most common
breathing-related sleep disorder, is characterized by obstruction of the upper airways during sleep, in spite of
an adequate respiratory effort. Typically, an individual
will have noisy breathing during sleep with loud snoring interspersed with apnoeic episodes lasting from
20 to 90 seconds, sometimes associated with cyanosis.
It is not an uncommon condition, affecting 4% of middle-aged men, 2% of adult women and 1% of children.
The prevalence is much higher in obese, elderly or hypertensive individuals and is also prominent in some
patients with intellectual disabilities. This illness has significant cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric morbidity
and should be actively excluded when an at-risk patient
presents with hypersomnia, impairment of concentration and memory or other psychiatric symptoms. Collateral history from a bed-partner, who is often aware
of the sleeping difficulties, is extremely useful.
COMMUNICATION
Insomnia occurs in a variety of physical conditions. It is
not uncommon for patients with poor sleep to be
treated for depression before their obstructive sleep
apnoea is correctly diagnosed. You may find it useful to
have a list of possible diagnoses in your mind.

Sleep terrors (night terrors)
Sleep terrors are episodes that feature an individual
(usually a child) abruptly waking from sleep, usually

Definitions and classification
with a scream, appearing to be in a state of extreme fear.
These episodes are associated with:
• Autonomic arousal, e.g. tachycardia, dilated pupils,
sweating and rapid breathing.
• A relative unresponsiveness to the efforts of others to
comfort the person, who appears confused and
disorientated.
Upon full awakening, there is amnesia for the episode
and no recall of any dream or nightmare. Sleep terrors
last from 1 to 10 minutes, and usually occur during
slow wave sleep (stage 3 and 4) and are therefore predominantly in the first third of the night. Sleep terrors
are seen in up to 6% of children aged 4–12 and usually
resolve by adolescence. Sleepwalking and sleep terrors
seem to be related conditions as they share clinical and
aetiological similarities. Sleep terrors should be distinguished from nightmares, panic attacks, and epileptic
seizures. Panic attacks tend not to be associated with confusion, and amnesia is uncommon.

Nightmares
Between 10% and 50% of children aged 3–5 experience
repeated nightmares, although they occur occasionally
in up to 50% of adults. Nightmares are characterized
by an individual waking from sleep due to an intensely
frightening dream involving threats to survival, security
or self-esteem. Nightmares are distinguished from sleep
terrors by the observation that not only is the individual

30

alert and orientated immediately after awakening, but is
able to recall the bad dream in vivid detail. Furthermore,
nightmares tend to occur during the second half of the
night because they arise almost exclusively during REM
sleep, which tends to be longer and have more intense,
surreal dreaming during the latter part of the night.

Sleepwalking (somnambulism)
Sleepwalking is characterized by an unusual state of
consciousness in which complex motor behaviour occurs during sleep. While sleepwalking, the individual
has a blank staring face, is relatively unresponsive to
communication from others, and is difficult to waken.
When sleepwalkers do wake up, either during an episode or the following morning, they have no recollection of the event ever having occurred. Sleepwalking
is not associated with impairment of cognition or behaviour, although there may be an initial brief period
of disorientation subsequent to waking up from a sleepwalking episode. Sleepwalking usually occurs during
slow wave sleep (stage 3 and 4) and is therefore predominant in the first third of the night. The peak prevalence of sleepwalking occurs at the age of 12, with an
onset between the age of 4 and 8 years. About 2–3% of
children and about 0.5% of adults have regular episodes.
Sleepwalking runs in families with 80% of sleepwalkers
having a positive family history for sleepwalking or sleep
terrors.

The psychosexual disorders

Objectives
After this chapter you should have an understanding of:
• How sexual dysfunction is classified in relation to the four-phase sexual response cycle
• The three most common sexual dysfunctions in men and women respectively
• How age, physical and relationship health and educational achievement affect sexual functioning
• How antidepressants worsen and improve sexual functioning
• The principles of sex therapy and which type of couples are most suitable
• Which techniques may be useful in treating premature ejaculation
• Which biological treatments may be effective in erectile dysfunction
• Which sexual dysfunctions have the best prognosis
• Which paraphilias are most often seen in forensic settings and how they differ in terms of their
classification
• Which interventions have limited efficacy in the treatment of paraphilias
• The management options for gender dysphoria

Healthy sexual functioning requires a healthy body and,
perhaps more importantly, a healthy mind and relationship. Physical or psychological problems (or a combination of the two) can cause a wide variety of sexual
problems. Mental health workers may be consulted
about sexual problems that are largely due to psychological difficulties (not predominantly due to a biological
problem) – i.e. psychosexual problems.
The psychosexual disorders can be classified into
three groups:
• Sexual dysfunction.
• Disorders of sexual preference (paraphilias).
• Gender identity disorders.

SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION

Clinical features
The DSM-IV describes the sequence of psychological
and physiological responses to sexual stimulation in a
four-phase sexual response cycle, which is summarized
in Figure 31.1.
Sexual dysfunction describes pain associated with intercourse or abnormalities of the sexual response cycle
that lead to difficulties in participating in sexual activities. Although this chapter is focused on psychogenic
dysfunction, the sexual response cycle consists of both
psychological and biological processes and it is rarely
possible to identify cases of sexual dysfunction with a

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3636-2.00031-X

purely physiological or purely psychogenic aetiology.
Nevertheless, both the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV stipulate
that a sexual dysfunction disorder should only be diagnosed when there is a suspected psychogenic component to the problem (i.e. not due exclusively to a
medical condition or use of a substance). Figure 31.2
summarizes the sexual dysfunction disorders.

HINTS AND TIPS
Women have a large inter-individual variability in the
type and duration of stimulation that results in orgasm.
The diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder should only
be made if the ability to achieve orgasm is less than
would be reasonably expected for a woman’s age,
sexual experience and quality of sexual activity – and
then only if the orgasmic dysfunction results in marked
distress or relationship difficulties.

Epidemiology
Sexual dysfunction is very common, with a prevalence
of about 43% in women and 31% in men. The reported
frequency of specific sexual dysfunction is shown in
Figure 31.3. The evidence suggests that:
• The prevalence of sexual problems in women tends
to decrease with increasing age, except for those who
report trouble lubricating.

207

The psychosexual disorders

Phase 1: Desire
Consists of sexual fantasies and the desire to have sexual activity

Phase 2: Excitement
Consists of the subjective sense of sexual pleasure and the accompanying physiological changes (e.g. erection in the
man; vaginal lubrication in the woman)

Phase 3: Orgasm
Consists of the peaking of sexual pleasure, release of sexual tension and rhythmic contraction of the perineal
muscles and pelvic reproductive organs (men: sensation of ejaculatory inevitably followed by ejaculation;
women: contractions of outer third of vagina)

Phase 4: Resolution
Consists of a sense of muscular relaxation and general well-being. Men are refractory to further erection and orgasm
for a period of time. Women may be able to have multiple orgasms.

Fig. 31.1 The four-phase sexual response cycle

• Men, in contrast, have an increased prevalence of
erectile problems and lack of interest in sex with increasing age.
• Sexual dysfunction is more likely among people
with poor physical and emotional health.

• Sexual dysfunction is highly associated with negative
experiences in sexual relationships.
• Married individuals and those with high educational
attainment are at a lower risk of experiencing sexual
dysfunction.

Aetiology
There are many, often interrelated, psychosocial factors
that may result in psychogenic sexual dysfunction:
• Ambivalent attitude about sex or intimacy (e.g. anxiety, fear, guilt, shame).
• History of rape or childhood sexual abuse.
• Fears of consequences of sex (e.g. impregnation, sexually transmitted diseases).
• A poor or deteriorating relationship (e.g. feeling undesirable, finding the partner undesirable, lack of
trust, feelings of resentment or hostility, lack of respect, fear of rejection).
• Anxiety about sexual performance or physical
attractiveness.
• Fatigue, stress or difficult psychosocial circumstances.
Frequently, there is more than one psychosocial problem that can affect more than one of the phases of the
sexual response cycle. For example, the belief that sex
is inherently sinful, in the context of an abusive relationship may lead to a lack of desire, a poor lubrication–
swelling response and difficulty in reaching orgasm.

Differential diagnosis
Other causes of sexual dysfunction should be excluded
when assessing a patient with sexual dysfunction. These
include:
• Medical conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, vascular
disease, vaginitis, endometriosis, spinal cord injuries, pelvic fractures, prostatectomy, multiple sclerosis, thyroid disease, hyperprolactinaemia).
• Prescribed or illicit drugs (see Fig. 31.4).
• Psychiatric illness: mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and alcohol dependence are frequently
associated with sexual dysfunction. In addition,
psychiatric medication often results in sexual dysfunction as a side-effect. However, sexual functioning frequently improves as the patient’s mental

31

antipsychotics)

• Lithium
Recreational drugs

• Cocaine
• Opiates

• Antihistamines
• Antihypertensives (including beta-blockers)

• Diuretics

illness (e.g. depression) improves, even though the
medication (e.g. antidepressants) may have adverse
sexual effects.

HINTS AND TIPS
The clear presence of a biological cause of sexual
dysfunction does not rule out a psychogenic sexual
dysfunction, as the two are often interrelated. For
example, a 55-year-old man with diabetes and
advanced atherosclerosis notices a weakened erection;
he subsequently becomes anxious during sex, fearing
that he is losing his virility. This leads to a complete loss
of his erectile potency.

Assessment considerations
• The wide differential diagnosis requires a comprehensive history including medical, psychiatric, sexual and relationship histories as well as current
medication and recreational substance use. Questions regarding sexual matters outside the problematic context (e.g. morning erections, masturbatory
activities) can be very helpful.
• A thorough physical examination, including genitalia, should be conducted. In addition, gynaecological
examination may be needed for cases of dyspareunia
or vaginismus in women.
• In addition to blood tests (e.g. thyroid functions,
fasting glucose, liver and renal functions, prolactin,

209

The psychosexual disorders
testosterone), further investigations may be necessary to exclude medical causes of sexual dysfunction
(e.g. monitoring of nocturnal penile tumescence (excludes physiological causes of impotence if able to
have erection during REM sleep) and monitoring
penile blood flow with Doppler ultrasonography).
COMMUNICATION
Taking a sexual history can be embarrassing for both
patients and doctors, and basic communication skills are
very important. Privacy should be ensured, and
non-verbal aspects of communication utilized (e.g.
body language, use of silence). Appropriate
terminology should be used (e.g. ‘vagina’, rather than
‘down below’; ‘condom’, rather than ‘protection’).
Reassurance and acknowledgement of discomfort (e.g.
‘I can see how difficult this is for you to talk about’) can
be very helpful.

Management considerations
• Many patients may need no more than reassurance,
advice and sexual education. Furthermore, patients
who have significant relationship difficulties may be
advised to engage in relationship counselling before
attempting specific treatment for sexual dysfunction.
• Some couples with minor problems benefit from
self-help materials, particularly those with no major
relationship difficulties.
• Urology clinics deal mainly with physiological sexual dysfunction, particularly erectile problems.
• Sexual dysfunction clinics have multidisciplinary
teams that focus on both psychological and physical
aspects of sexual dysfunction and are best equipped
to deal with cases that do not respond to nonspecific measures.
• Some couples benefit from sex therapy, in which
partners are treated together and are taught to communicate openly about sex, in addition to receiving
education about sexual anatomy and the physiology
of the sexual response cycle. They also take part in
graded assignments, beginning with caressing of
their partner’s body, without genital contact, for
their own and then their partner’s pleasure. These
behavioural tasks progress through a number of
stages with increasing sexual intimacy, with the focus remaining on pleasurable physical contact as opposed to the monitoring of sexual arousal or the
preoccupation with achieving orgasm. Couples suitable for sex therapy include those with a significant
psychological component to their problem, those
with reasonable motivation and those with a reasonably harmonious relationship.

• Figure 31.5 summarizes some of the specific exercises often used in the context of sex therapy that
may be helpful with particular problems.
• Biological treatments may be very effective, especially for erectile problems (e.g. oral sildenafil
(Viagra®), intracavernosal injections, vacuum devices, prosthetic implants and surgery for venous
leakage). Testosterone may increase sexual drive in
patients with low levels. For difficulties with premature ejaculation, SSRIs may delay ejaculation, but
this is rarely a long-term solution.

Prognosis
Vaginismus has an excellent prognosis. Premature ejaculation and psychogenic erectile dysfunction also respond fairly well to treatment. Problems associated
with poor sexual desire, especially in men, seem more
resistant to treatment.

DISORDERS OF SEXUAL
PREFERENCE (PARAPHILIAS)
The essential features of a paraphilia are recurrent sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviours involving: (1) non-human objects; (2) the suffering or
humiliation of oneself or one’s partner; or (3) children
or other non-consenting individuals. It is useful to divide the paraphilias into two groups:
1. Abnormalities of the object of sexual interest (e.g.
paedophilia, fetishism, transvestic fetishism).

Gender identity

Paedophilia

Sexual fantasies, urges or behaviours

Fetishism

involving inanimate objects or parts of
the body that are not directly
erogenous

Transvestic
fetishism

Sexual fantasies, urges or behaviours
involving cross-dressing (wearing of
clothes of the opposite sex). Rare in

sadism

Sexual fantasies, urges or behaviours
involving the infliction of acts of
physical or psychological suffering or
humiliation on others

Sexual
masochism

Sexual fantasies, urges or behaviours
involving the infliction of acts of
humiliation or suffering on oneself

2. Abnormalities of the sexual act (e.g. exhibitionism,
voyeurism, sexual sadism, sexual masochism).
Figure 31.6 summarizes the specific paraphilias.
The paraphilias are mainly confined to men (with
the exception of sexual masochism) and usually begin
in late adolescence or early adulthood. Paedophilia
and exhibitionism are frequently seen in a forensic setting and account for the majority of sexual offenders referred for a psychiatric opinion (see Ch. 29).
The aetiology is unknown, but there is often an impaired capacity for affectionate sexual activity and patients
with paraphilia often have personality disorders.
Management options include behaviour therapy (covert sensitization, where patients attempt to pair paraphilic thoughts with humiliating consequences) and
aversion therapy (pairing paraphilic thoughts with a
noxious stimulus such as an unpleasant odour or taste).
Individual psychodynamic and group therapies are also
used. Cognitive-behavioural therapy programmes and

31

anti-androgens (e.g. cyproterone acetate) have shown
some efficacy in the treatment of some paedophiles
and exhibitionists; however, there is little evidence that
any treatment is consistently effective in either of these
conditions. It should be noted that, dependent on risk
of offending, management within a forensic setting may
be required (see Ch. 29).
Paraphilias associated with a young age of onset, a
high frequency of acts, no remorse about acts and a lack
of motivation for change have a particularly poor
prognosis.

GENDER IDENTITY
Gender identity describes an individual’s inner sense of
being male or female. This usually corresponds to the
person’s sexual identity which comprises all their biological and anatomical sexual characteristics (i.e. external and internal genitalia, chromosomes, sex hormones
and secondary sex characteristics). Gender identity is
thought to be fully formed by the age of 3 years.
There has been considerable debate over the years as
to whether gender identity disorder (transsexualism) is
a mental disorder. Many do not regard cross-gender feelings and behaviours as a ‘disorder’, and instead question
what constitutes a normal gender identity or gender
role. The DSM-V (due to supersede the DSM-IV in
mid-2013) has replaced the term with the (less stigmatizing) term ‘gender dysphoria’.
Many areas provide multidisciplinary clinics for people whose biological gender is inconsistent with their
gender identity. The role of the psychiatrist is to exclude
the presence of mental disorder as a cause of gender dysphoria, and to assess and treat comorbid mental disorders which may be present.
Patients who are committed to gender change can be
helped with hormones and surgery, usually after they
have completed a ‘real life test’, which involves living
as the opposite sex for at least a year.

HINTS AND TIPS
Transsexualism (gender dysphoria) and transvestism
are not the same. Transsexualism describes a refusal to
live as the gender assigned at birth, while transvestism
describes dressing in clothes intended for members of
the opposite sex. Questions you may find useful to
differentiate between the two include: do they wish to
be accepted as the opposite sex? Are they content with
their gender? Does cross-dressing cause sexual
arousal? The latter would suggest transvestic fetishism.

1. A 15-year-old girl has moderate symptoms of
depression. She has recently been referred for cognitivebehavioural therapy, but found it difficult to
concentrate.
2. An 8-year-old boy has ADHD, which is causing
significant problems with his schoolwork. He has never
been on medication for this before.
3. A 7-year-old girl suffers from nocturnal enuresis.
Behavioural strategies and psychosocial interventions
have been unsuccessful.
4. A 13-year-old boy has Tourette’s syndrome. There is no
suggestion of ADHD or OCD. His symptoms are
troublesome and he has not responded to psychosocial
interventions.
5. An 11-year-old girl has ADHD. Her symptoms
responded well to methylphenidate; however, she
developed tics.

For the following examples, select the ONE most likely diagnosis from the list above.
1. The mother of a 7-year-old boy raises concerns about his
behaviour. He becomes distressed when they drive a
different route to school, and the family have been unable
to go on holiday because of this. He spends much of his
spare time looking at road maps, and seems very
interested about the UK motorway network. There have
been no concerns about his speech and language
development.

2. The father of a 6-year-old girl is concerned that she has
recently started wetting the bed, and also wetting her
clothes during the day. Her mother committed suicide 3
months ago.
3. A 6-year-old boy is referred by educational psychology,
due to his behaviour at school. He seems to be unable to
concentrate on his schoolwork, and has been running
around the classroom distracting fellow pupils from
completing their work, often by jumping on tables and
throwing chairs around. On one occasion, he flooded
the play area when he broke a water pipe. His parents
are very surprised, because he is entirely normal at
home.
4. A 12-year-old boy has been incredibly disobedient, both
at school and within the home. He has been dancing in
front of the TV when his father has been watching the
football. He has also been using curse words in the
house, and – on two occasions in the last week – has run
away from home after being confined to his room. His
parents are surprised that he has not been bullying
others, or in trouble with the police.
5. An 11-year-old girl has stereotyped hand-flapping and
appears obsessed with trains. She does not appear
interested in playing or interacting with others. Her
parents report that her development was entirely
normal until just after she was 2 years old, after which
she seemed to deteriorate.

For each of the scenarios below, select the ONE most appropriate estimation of IQ and level of disability from the list
above.
1. A 24-year-old woman lives alone and works in a bakery.
She cannot serve customers as she finds it very difficult
to use the cash register or give the correct change. She
needed extra help at school with reading and writing,
and did not achieve any qualifications.
2. A 19-year-old man lives alone, does not see his family
and is unemployed. He has no support at home, and
spends much of his time writing programmes on his
computer and reading about the mathematics of
quantum mechanics. He has always found social
interactions to be difficult, and strongly dislikes
socializing with others. There were no problems with
language development.

Extended-matching questions (EMQs)
3. A 14-year-old boy is wheelchair-bound and
incontinent. He lives with his mother, who is his main
carer. He is unable to undertake any activities of daily
living, and his mother has to feed him.
4. A 35-year-old woman lives in sheltered
accommodation, and requires support to cook meals, to
keep her flat tidy and to do laundry. She has a job at a
local toy factory, where she works on a production line
and is closely supervised by a trained support worker.
5. A 22-year-old man lives with his family, who are his
main carers. He requires some assistance getting
dressed and tending to his personal hygiene; however,
he can do this by himself on good days. He can feed
himself, and spends his days watching children’s
television programmes and playing with Lego.

in height and obese. Her parents report that she seems
to have an excessive appetite, and never seems to stop
eating.
2. A 2-year-old boy recently started biting his fingers and
banging his head off walls.
3. A 7-year-old girl initially met developmental milestones,
but then seemed to regress. She has a severe intellectual
disability, and stereotyped tortuous ‘hand washing’
movements are noted.
4. A 14-year-old girl with a mild intellectual disability
remains pre-pubertal. Her verbal IQ is greater than her
performance IQ.
5. A 4-year-old boy has a severe intellectual disability.
He appears hypotonic, with microcephaly, low set ears,
and single palmar crease. His mother reported that he
used to make odd crying noises as an infant, but has
stopped now.

K. Drug-induced psychosis
For each of the following scenarios, select the ONE most appropriate diagnosis from the list above.
1. A 35-year-old man was arrested after he assaulted a bus
driver. He believed that the driver was trying to procure
the services of his wife, who he is convinced is working
as a prostitute. He has dismissed extensive reassurances
from his wife and his own siblings. He reports that he
has a sword in the back of his car, and intended to ‘get
the truth out of her’. He has a history of alcohol abuse.
2. A 50-year-old man with no psychiatric history was
arrested after committing a public order offence on a
train home from a music festival. He assaulted three
police officers and required restraint. At interview, he
appears distressed and is clearly responding to auditory
hallucinations. He is convinced that the police are Nazis
who plan to use his brain for experimentation.
3. A 21-year-old woman has been charged with fraud. She
has applied for several credit cards and bank loans in the
last fortnight, and has used a number of different names
to do so. She says that she is a pop star and needs money
to fund a world tour. She was recently discharged from
hospital following a depressive episode.
4. A 44-year-old man is arrested and charged with
murdering a sandwich shop clerk, who was on his way
home from work. He has an extensive forensic history
and is a well-known member of an organized criminal
gang. He denies any psychiatric history, and admits
killing the man because he got his order wrong. He
appears cold and emotionless.
5. A 30-year-old man is arrested and charged with setting
his neighbour’s caravan on fire. He appears to be from a
distant town; however, he reports that he used to have
contact with psychiatric services as a youngster. He
thought his actions would please people in his
neighbourhood because the flames were ‘pretty’.

– Assess ABC. This man is likely to be experiencing
neuroleptic malignant syndrome. After ABC has
been addressed all antipsychotics should also be
discontinued. The other answers are all possible
treatment options, but none are first line. Before
they are considered he needs initial resuscitation
and then is likely to need transfer to a general
hospital for investigation and monitoring. See

– Weekly FBC. Without monitoring, just under 3%
of patients treated with clozapine develop
neutropenia (low neutrophil count) and just under
1% develop agranulocytosis (negligible
neutrophil count). This is most likely to occur early
in treatment. Therefore weekly FBC are advised
initially. As with all antipsychotics, she will also
require regular checks of blood pressure, liver

parameters should be checked 1–3 monthly
initially, then annually.

reaction. In the first instance, it would be helpful
to refer him to bereavement counselling, which
most commonly takes the form of person-centred
counselling. In the UK, Cruse are a large voluntary
sector run service offering bereavement
counselling. Psychodynamic therapy, cognitivebehavioural therapy and mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy have little evidence to support
their use in this instance. Exposure and response
prevention is a behavioural therapy used in the
treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
A comprehensive review of psychotherapy
research showed that common factors (operable
in any model of therapy) account for 85% of the
therapeutic effect, whereas theoretical
orientation only accounts for 15%. Common
therapeutic factors include client factors (personal
strengths, social supports), therapist–client
relationship factors (empathy, acceptance,
warmth), and the client’s expectancy of change.
Therefore, the use of a modality with which the
patient can identify and work may be more
important than the theoretical basis of the
therapy itself.
Transference is the theoretical process by which
the patient transfers feelings or attitudes
experienced in an earlier significant relationship
onto the therapist. Counter-transference refers to
the feelings that are evoked in the therapist during
the course of therapy. The therapist pays
attention to noticing these feelings, as these may
be representative of what the patient is feeling,
and so helps the therapist to empathize with the
patient. Often the therapist has undergone
therapy themselves as part of their training: this
helps the therapist to separate out what feelings
belong to them, and what feelings to the patient.
Assertiveness training is not associated with
graded exposure.
This cognitive distortion is an example of
magnification (also known as ‘catastrophization’),
where things get ‘blown out of proportion’. An
example of emotional reasoning in this context
would be ‘I feel so miserable, so I must have failed
my exam’. An example of fortune telling would be

255

BOF answers

6. B

‘I failed my exam, so in the future no one will
employ me’. An example of personalization would
be ‘it is all my fault: I failed my exams’. An
example of labelling would be ‘I am stupid’. Note
that more than one type of cognitive distortion
can exist in the same patient in the same
circumstances.

of interpersonal therapy in the treatment of mild
to moderate depression.

– Patient A lacks capacity as he will not be able to
communicate his decisions. Patient B is likely to
lack capacity for any decisions requiring more
consideration than is available in working memory
as he will not be able to retain information for long
enough to weigh it up. Patient C lacks capacity for
the decision about surgery as she does not believe
the information because of a delusion. However,
she is likely to have capacity for decisions about
which she does not have delusions. Patient D is
very likely to lack capacity for this decision as she is
unlikely to be able to understand the risks and
benefits of contraception. However, she may
have capacity for simpler decisions and patients
with less severe intellectual disabilities may be able
to decide about contraception. Patient E should be
assumed to have capacity to make a decision
about a statin, unless his psychotic symptoms
relate to cholesterol.
– She needs to notify the DVLA of her diagnosis.
They will then ask for a doctor’s report and
potentially a driving assessment, and are likely to
arrange more frequent review of the licence than
otherwise (e.g. annually). It is the DVLA’s decision
as to whether she is fit to drive or not. Many
patients with mild dementia are found fit to
continue to drive. Patient and partner reports of
driving can be unreliable as patients can have poor
insight and partners may not want to act in a way
they perceive as harming the patient, or
themselves. It is the patient’s responsibility to
notify the DVLA although doctors may need to do
so if patients ignore this advice and present a
significant risk to others through driving.

– The other options demonstrate treatment
resistance, bipolar disorder, significant risk to self

and diagnostic uncertainty, all of which
means referral to secondary care should be
considered.
– Early intervention in psychosis team. This man
may be experiencing prodromal psychosis. He
does not currently appear to be at high enough
risk to require home treatment or admission. As he
does not have an established diagnosis of mental
illness, an assertive outreach team is not
appropriate. A community mental health team
could manage him, but early intervention teams
are expert at identifying early psychosis so are best
placed to monitor him.

– While all of these symptoms are common in those
with depression, suicide is more common in those
with insomnia, psychomotor agitation, feelings of
worthlessness and psychotic symptoms.
– By far the most common reason given in a large
recent study was to ‘escape from a terrible state of
mind’. This could similarly be described as
‘releasing tension’. The other reasons were far less
common.
– Measuring serum paracetamol levels (plus INR,
liver function, etc.) to determine the requirement
for potentially life-saving treatment is the priority
in this case. This can be measured from 4 hours
post-ingestion although levels become harder to
interpret after 15 hours. Psychiatric evaluation
and risk assessment can be initiated after this.
– Veterinary surgeons have a very high rate of
completed suicide. This may relate to their easy
access to lethal medications. There is also a
high rate of burnout and stress associated with the
job.
– While researching methods is also worrying, acts
of closure (such as making a will, organizing
finances, writing suicide notes) are the most
worrying signs, and may suggest strong suicidal
intent. Contacting voluntary support agencies
(such as the Samaritans) suggests emotional
distress, but also a degree of ambivalence. Telling
his wife of his plans may be a way of
communicating his feelings to her, but is not
necessarily a final act.
– Suspension hanging is the most common method
of completed suicide in England and Wales, and
many other countries. Means are widely available,
and lethality is high. Self-inflicted firearm wounds
are most common in the USA. Paracetamol is the
most common drug of overdose in the UK;

BOF answers
however, advances in medical treatment and
public health measures have reduced mortality
associated with this. Jumping from height is a
fairly ‘public’ method of suicide, and is thus often
reported in the news (although media coverage of
all suicides has reduced in recent years due to
campaigns to reduce ‘advertising’ suitable
locations). Carbon monoxide poisoning used to be
fairly common; however, catalytic converters on
modern motor vehicles has reduced fatality of this
method.

– Prednisolone is the only medication listed

– The midline neck swelling may represent a goitre.
Given the patient’s symptoms are mild, there is
time to check her thyroid function. If she is
hypothyroid this should be treated first, which
may normalize her mood without need for an
antidepressant.
– The patient reports a nihilistic delusion. This is
mood-congruent. Therefore the most likely
diagnosis is depression with psychotic features.
Schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder are unlikely to have onset at his age.
– Suicidal ideation should be checked at every
appointment.
– This patient is in a situational crisis. It is likely that
her symptoms will resolve spontaneously. She
needs reassurance and to be offered a follow-up
appointment to check on her progress. She cannot
be diagnosed with depression as her symptoms
are present for less than 2 weeks. However, she
may still be at risk of self-harm and should be
screened for this.

– Irritability is the commonest mood state in mania,
not euphoria. Often patients fluctuate. Delusional
mood is seen in the prodrome to schizophrenia
(see p. 68).
– Thought disorder due to mania. Dysarthria or Broca’s
asphasia would not lead to rapid incoherent speech,
but to slow, halting speech. A partial seizure would
not cause incoherent speech, although confusion
may be present postictally. Substance use would be
important to exclude.
– Bipolar affective disorder. An episode of
depression is not necessary to meet criteria for

bipolar affective disorder. Recurrent mania and
hypomania are not diagnoses. No first rank
symptoms are mentioned, making schizoaffective
disorder unlikely.
– Urine drug screen. This will demonstrate recent
use of common recreational drugs (although not
newer drugs such as ‘legal highs’). The main
differentials in a healthy young man are a manic
episode or mania secondary to psychoactive
substance use. FBC should be performed to check
for evidence of infection, but is likely to be normal.
TFT should be checked to exclude
hyperthyroidism but is also likely to be normal.
EEG and CT head should only be requested if there
are neurological abnormalities.
– Emotionally unstable personality disorder. This
woman describes a persistent pattern of
maladaptive behaviour present since childhood
associated with social and occupational
dysfunction. This is a personality disorder. The
mood swings are faster than would occur within
bipolar affective disorder and she has never had a
period of normality, required for a diagnosis of a
mental illness. The symptoms cause marked
functional impairment, excluding cyclothymia.
Dysthymia is prolonged low mood, not mood
swings. Although multiple sclerosis can present
with emotional lability it would not have onset in
childhood.

3. D

– Charles Bonnet syndrome. On the basis of the
information given here, Charles Bonnet syndrome
(see p. 67) is the most likely diagnosis. However, it
is crucial to exclude delirium with a physical
examination and cognitive assessment.
– Ischaemic heart disease. This man has risk factors
for ischaemic heart disease (age, male, smoker)
and gives a description of exercise-induced chest
pain with a classic ‘weight on chest’ description
typical of cardiac ischaemia. People with
schizophrenia may be at increased risk of
cardiovascular disease. Although this symptom
could also be a tactile hallucination it is important
to exclude a physical origin before making this
attribution.
– Over-valued idea. Delusional jealousy is the key
differential here, but the belief his wife is having
an affair appears to be based on logical grounds,
so he cannot be said to be delusional. The belief is
not described as recurrent or intrusive so is not an
obsession. However, the impact of the belief on
this man’s life is substantial as he has become

preoccupied with it to an unreasonable extent.
This is an over-valued idea (see p. 68).
– Psychosis secondary to psychoactive substance
use (a drug induced psychosis). This is the most
likely diagnosis; however, a definite diagnosis
requires a longitudinal assessment. The diagnosis
would be confirmed if he stops using substances
and his symptoms resolve. However, chronic
cannabis use is a risk factor for schizophrenia and
if his symptoms persist despite abstaining from
substances this may emerge as the diagnosis. At
present he has not had the symptoms long
enough to meet criteria for schizophrenia in any
case.
– Hebephrenic. This boy shows prominent thought
disorder, incongruous affect and negative
symptoms. Hebephrenic schizophrenia has an
early onset and a poor prognosis.

– Panic attack. This is the most likely diagnosis based
on the history. However, it is important to take a
full medical history (e.g. asthma, congenital heart
disease) and family history (e.g. sudden death in
young relatives) and to exclude other causes such
as hyperthyroidism and hypoglycaemia,
particularly given her repeat attendances. It would
also be useful to know whether the attacks appear
to have triggers (e.g. substance use/withdrawal/
going to the library).
– Blood–injection–injury phobia. This is suggested
by his situational paroxysmal anxiety and
avoidance.
– Observations. The first step in management is
ABC. She is speaking to you so her airway is
maintained independently. The next step is to
ascertain her breathing and circulation status.
Although the differential includes a panic attack,
she could also be experiencing a wide range of
acute medical problems requiring urgent
management.
– Check blood sugar. Someone with type 1 diabetes
will be receiving insulin. The description sounds
very much like hypoglycaemia. If hypoglycaemia
is confirmed it is important to treat the episode by
consuming carbohydrate, and then examine his
insulin/food/activity regime to reduce further
episodes.
– Alcohol withdrawal. This man is drinking at least
60 units/week. He is experiencing physiological
withdrawal symptoms after a few hours without
alcohol, and the symptoms are relieved by further

alcohol. Although anxiety in the morning may be
part of diurnal variation in a depressive disorder,
this man’s mood is generally good.

and compulsions

– No mental illness. Lay people often use ‘obsession’
loosely. Her thoughts of the show are not
obsessional as they are ego-syntonic, pleasurable
and not resisted. She describes no compulsions.
Calling in sick represents unethical behaviour
rather than a mental illness.
– Depressive episode. This man reports obsessions,
but they are concurrent with the change in his
mood, meeting the criteria for a depressive
episode of moderate severity (five depressive
symptoms). The obsessions are mood-congruent.
Depression rather than obsessive-compulsive
disorder is the primary diagnosis.
– Obsessive-compulsive disorder with comorbid
depressive episode. This man describes obsessions
and compulsions associated with functional
impairment of greater than 2 weeks duration,
giving him a diagnosis of OCD. Superimposed on
this he has developed a depressive episode, mild
severity (four symptoms).
– Obsessive-compulsive (anankastic) personality
disorder. This is suggested by her lifelong history of
unusual conscientiousness and perfectionism which
has caused some functional impairment (reduction
of leisure time and being made redundant). Her
thoughts of perfection are ego-syntonic and not
resisted, meaning they are not true obsessions.
Staying late to check is not a compulsion as it is not
an unreasonable way to achieve her goal (assuming
she does not check an excessive number of times).
– Pseudohallucination. She reports a perception in
the absence of a stimulus from within internal
space. A hallucination would occur in external
space. An obsession would be attributed to
herself. A thought insertion would be attributed to
an external agency. See Fig. 11.4.

Chapter 12 The patient with a reaction

– It is vital to aggressively exclude physical aetiology
prior to attributing symptoms to psychological
causes. In this case, excluding intracranial
haemorrhage secondary to head injury should
take priority. This should include a history of the

mechanism of assault (with corroboration from a
witness if possible), full neurological examination,
and appropriate investigations (which may include
a CT brain).
– This describes symptoms of fairly marked
psychomotor retardation, which would be
suggestive that a depressive illness has developed
from the bereavement reaction. The other
symptoms (wanting to be dead, poor
concentration, intense guilt, hallucinations
involving the deceased) are typical of normal
bereavement.
– This woman is suffering from an adjustment
disorder, characterized by difficulty coping with a
significant change in circumstances. Feelings of
inability to cope are fairly typical of difficult
adjustment. Note the duration of onset of
symptoms, and the fact that she has been signed
off work, suggesting disruption to occupational
functioning (which suggests that a diagnosis is
appropriate, as opposed to ‘no mental illness’).
Also, she does not appear to be suffering from
other symptoms that would suggest an affective
or anxiety disorder.
– While traumatic stressors can exacerbate preexisting (or precipitate initial onset of) major
psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia,
developing these as a sole result of trauma is
unusual. Acute and transient psychotic illnesses
are more common. Note this gentleman is 34 years
old. The fact that he has been employed as a soldier
is suggestive that he has no pre-existing
schizophrenia. Psychotic SYMPTOMS, on the
other hand, are very common in those with PTSD as
part of the disorder itself, associated with alcohol
(alcoholic hallucinosis, withdrawal state), or
associated with comorbid depression.
– This case is fairly typical of dissociative amnesia.
She has no memory of a circumscribed period of
her life, with intact memory for her past and the
more recent present. While head trauma is
naturally a concern, she appears to have been able
to make her way to the UK and apply for asylum,
which would suggest that cognitive impairment
has not been global, and she has been able to
function at a reasonable level. She has no
symptoms suggestive of PTSD at this time, and
the memory loss is more prolonged than would be
expected in this disorder. In terms of stressful
events, while she is unable to recall anything, she
is seeking asylum from an area in which human
rights violations are widely reported. The fact that
she was pregnant with no recollection of
conception or termination may suggest that she
has been the victim of rape (which would be a
traumatic stressor).

6. B

– According to ICD-10, symptoms must occur
within 1 month of the original stressor. This is
extended to 3 months when DSM-IV criteria are
applied. There is no indication of severity of the
actual stressor, and instead it is the subjective
experience of the stressor that is important.
Suicidal ideation is common in adjustment
disorder; however, this is not a criterion. Alcohol
consumption may increase, but this is not a
criterion. Also, if a patient meets criteria for
another psychiatric disorder, this is the diagnosis,
not an adjustment disorder.

– These situations are commonly encountered by
GPs. The patient may well be developing multiple
sclerosis; however, his symptoms are minimal and
insufficient to make any diagnosis. Overzealous
attempts to take his problems seriously by a wellintentioned doctor (such as referral to neurology,
advanced investigations or arranging urgent
follow-up) may reinforce his belief that something
is wrong. However, dismissal by telling him it is ‘all
in his head’ (or – at this stage – even empathic
suggestion of psychiatric illness) is likely to cause
him to seek a second opinion, and in any case is
irresponsible given the inconclusive evidence.
In the first instance, empathic acknowledgement
and explanation, and inviting the patient to
re-attend if further symptoms arise (watchful
waiting) is the most balanced option of the above.
– This lady describes classic symptoms of body
dysmorphic disorder, which some consider to be a
subtype of hypochondriacal disorder. However,
the psychopathology would suggest that she is
concerned with her appearance as opposed to an
underlying disease. If she did hold the over-valued
idea with delusional intensity, somatic delusional
disorder should be considered. Note that some
patients may exaggerate (or even feign)
psychological sequelae of imagined or minor flaws
in their appearance in order to receive cosmetic
surgery paid for by the state, which would be
malingering.
– Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an example of
somatoform autonomic dysfunction. Note the
absence of other symptoms, the presence of
clinical signs, and the fact the gut is largely under
autonomic control.
– ICD-10 criteria state that symptoms need to have
been present for at least 2 years. If this is not the
case but the symptoms are suggestive of

259

somatoform illness, the diagnosis of
‘undifferentiated somatoform disorder’ should be
considered.
– This history is highly suggestive of factitious
disorder (female, healthcare professional,
symptoms without signs, great knowledge,
specific demands, far from home). It is imperative
to contact previous hospitals to get more
information; however, asking the patient for such
contact details may yield vague answers (in some
cases, requesting such details will result in the
patient discharging themselves). Details of such
patients are often shared between local A&E
departments.
– Onset of such symptoms in older people with no
significant medical or psychiatric history is more
likely to be indicative of insidious organic disease.
Prior to attribution of symptoms to a psychological
origin, physical disease needs to be aggressively
excluded. In this case, physical investigations have
been inappropriate to exclude likely physical
illnesses.
– This presentation is classic somatization disorder
(Briquet’s syndrome). Note the multiple and
changing symptoms, refusal to accept the
absence of physical cause, and duration of more
than 2 years.

has already received, vitamin B12 and folate level
and structural neuroimaging as a minimum
assessment for reversible causes of dementia.
However, there is some clinical judgement
involved. There is no reason to think this man needs
syphilis and HIV serology but for other patients it
may be appropriate. Practice varies locally and
some centres would not request a CT head unless
there are neurological signs. See Fig. 14.13.
– Delirium. This woman has recently been extremely
unwell. Even though her UTI has been successfully
treated the brain can often lag behind the rest of
the body when recovering from a serious illness.
The fluctuation in her mental state may reflect a
resolving or a new delirium. It would be wise to
reassess for other causes that may have been
missed initially or occurred since admission, e.g. a
hospital acquired pneumonia. It may be that she
does not regain her premorbid cognitive
functioning and in due course is diagnosed with
dementia, but it is too early to make this diagnosis.
– Anticholinergic medication. This man has a
delirium. Amitriptyline is sometimes used to
reduce insomnia, although this is extremely
inadvisable in an older adult, so this may be the
precipitant. The other options are all causes of
delirium but have been excluded by his normal
investigations.

– Delirium. This is suggested by her acute onset
objective cognitive impairment associated with
sleep–wake cycle disturbance. Suspicion and
visual hallucinations are common in delirium.
Although Lewy body dementia is commonly
associated with visual hallucinations it is excluded
by the acute onset. Similarly Alzheimer’s is
excluded by the acute onset. Late onset
schizophrenia remains a possibility but is far less
likely than delirium. Charles Bonnet syndrome
would not account for all the features here,
e.g. persecutory beliefs, sleep–wake cycle
disturbance, cognitive impairment.
– Amnesic syndrome. This man has an isolated longterm anterograde and retrograde memory
impairment with intact working memory and
other cognitive function. He is confabulating.
A history of alcohol excess raises the possibility
of Korsakoff’s syndrome as the cause. He does not
have dementia because the impairment is not
global or progressive.

– The Edwards and Gross criteria do not include
‘increased use of other substances’.
– This is classic alcoholic hallucinosis. Note the
absence of memory or attentional problems. Late
onset schizophrenia should be in the differential
diagnosis, but is unlikely in this case.
– This man’s presentation is highly suggestive of
delirium, and the history of heavy alcohol use is
likely to be of aetiological significance. Note the
‘lilliputian hallucinations’ – visual hallucinations of
small figures (in his case, a horse). Any surgical
intervention should be delayed pending clinical
improvement. Also note that it is very difficult to
exclude Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome in
delirious patients, and therefore this should be
empirically treated with parenteral thiamine.
– Prior to any substitute prescribing, it is vital to
establish that the drug being substituted is actually
being used, making urine drug testing the first step.
– To calculate alcohol units, take the %ABV and
multiply by volume (in litres): e.g. 40  0.350 ¼ 14
units; 350 mL of a 40% ABV spirit contains

14 units. Six pints (3.408 L) of continental lager
(5.3%ABV) contains 18 units; two bottles (1.5 L)
of red wine (12.5%ABV) contains 18.75 units; 3 L
of strong white cider (8.4%ABV) contains 25.2
units; and six bottles (1.980 L) of alco-pops (4.9%
ABV) contains 9.7 units. It should be recommended
that she takes no more than 2–3 units per sitting,
and has at least two alcohol-free days per week.
– Hypotension is not generally associated with
cocaine intoxication. More commonly, blood
pressure is significantly increased during
intoxication with cocaine. Hypotension may be
observed as a result of cardiac arrhythmia
associated with cocaine use/toxicity, which would
suggest imminent circulatory collapse (‘periarrest’), necessitating emergency treatment with
antiarrhythmics, cardioversion and intensive
specialist in-patient care.

– Chronic feelings of emptiness is the only criterion
listed here for borderline personality disorder.
According to DSM-IV, diagnosis of borderline
personality disorder requires a pervasive pattern
of instability of interpersonal relationships, selfimage and affects, as well as marked impulsivity,
beginning by early adulthood and present in a
variety of contexts.
– This man is likely to have schizoid personality
disorder, as suggested by his stable and pervasive
traits of social isolation and indifference to the
opinions of others, with no evidence of an axis
1 mental disorder.
– This man is likely to have antisocial personality
disorder. Antisocial personality disorder is very
prevalent within prisons.
– The difficulties associated with personality
disorders start in adolescence or early adulthood.
Also, the enduring pattern of psychological
experience should be longstanding and relatively
stable over time – not only when stressed.
It should manifest in at least two domains
(cognition, affect, interpersonal functioning,
impulse control), and should appear inflexible and
pervasive across a wide range of situations,
leading to clinically significant distress or
impairment in important areas of functioning. The
pattern must not be better accounted for as a
manifestation of another mental disorder, or to
the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g.
drug or medication) or a general medical
condition (e.g. head trauma).

– In this case, there is too little information to make
or exclude any diagnosis. The man is in a state of
emotional distress following a significant life event
(breakdown of a relationship, potential
homelessness), which is compounded with acute
intoxication. Initial management should focus on
physical care, alleviating distress, ensuring his (and
her) safety, and achieving sobriety. Further
psychiatric assessment (including collateral
history) at a later time is needed to establish a
diagnosis, or absence of mental illness.
– Obsessive thoughts are not ego-dystonic (‘against
the mind’) or distressing in obsessive compulsive
personality disorder. Instead, they are egosyntonic (‘with the mind’). This is one of the main
features that distinguishes the psychopathology of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder from
obsessive-compulsive disorder. The rest of the
answers are true.
– From this man’s difficulties, it is likely that he has
borderline personality disorder. Note the link
between childhood sexual abuse and borderline
personality disorder.

– A body weight of at least 15% below expected for
height is suggestive of anorexia nervosa. Patients
with bulimia nervosa are often of normal or
increased weight. Preoccupation with being thin,
as well as a dread of fatness and a distorted
perception of being too fat are associated with
both anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Again, use of
medication and exercise as means of controlling
weight can occur in both disorders.
– While patients with eating disorders often deny
their symptoms, it is very important to exclude
insidious physical illness as a cause of weight loss
before attributing to psychiatric disorder. Physical
causes can include malignancy, inflammatory
disorders, infection and endocrine abnormalities. In
this case, assessment of weight loss by a
paediatrician would be helpful.
– The use of alcohol or substances, along with
resultant self-neglect, can cause significant weight
loss. Prior to diagnosing an affective, anxiety or
eating disorder, a thorough drug and alcohol
history should be taken to exclude this as a cause.
Bear in mind that drug or alcohol misuse can also
be a comorbidity of many other psychiatric
disorders.
– Patients with anorexia nervosa usually have high
serum cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia). All

other abnormalities occur frequently in starvation
states.
– This lady has anorexia nervosa. She is dangerously
underweight. While all of the above mental
illnesses can cause weight loss, they are
differentiated from specific eating disorders by the
presence of dread of fatness, distortion of body
image and subsequent restriction of her dietary
intake. Although it is not sure whether she is
vomiting or not, the diagnosis of bulimia is unlikely
given her restrictive pattern of eating and her low
BMI (if she was vomiting, this could be described
as ‘anorexia nervosa, purging type’ rather than
‘restrictive type’).

– Treatment-resistant depression is an indication
for ECT but if the patient has capacity and does
not wish it, it is not given. No information is
given to suggest she lacks capacity, which is
presumed to be present in adults unless proven
otherwise. Life-threatening reduction in oral
intake, psychotic depression and previous
good response to ECT are all other indications
for ECT.
– Admission under mental health legislation. This
man is experiencing a manic episode with
psychotic features. His psychotic beliefs place him
at high risk of injury or death and are impairing his
ability to make decisions regarding management
of his mental health. It is not safe to let him go
home and police custody is not appropriate given
his behaviour is driven by illness. He may be
persuadable to be admitted informally but if not
he would meet criteria for detention under mental
health legislation (see Ch. 4).
– Citalopram and quetiapine. This man has a
severe depressive episode with psychotic features.
A combination of an antidepressant and an
antipsychotic is indicated. Citalopram is normally
tried before amitriptyline as it has fewer sideeffects. Also, amitriptyline is more toxic than
citalopram in overdose. Given his suicidal ideation
it is best to choose the less toxic medication.
Quetiapine or any other second generation
antipsychotic would be reasonable to treat his
psychosis.
– Her family history suggests she has may have
genes that increase her susceptibility to
depression. All the other options are risk factors
for depression too, but no information is given in
the question to suggest them.

– Olanzapine. Olanzapine, lithium or valproate are
the antimanic agents recommended by NICE
(2006). Lithium should not be started in the acute
situation in someone with a history of nonconcordance. Valproate should be avoided where
possible in a woman of childbearing age.
Lamotrigine is not recommended during acute
mania. Citalopram, or any other antidepressant,
should be discontinued in a manic patient. This
woman is likely also to need rapid tranquillization
with a benzodiazapine (see p. 146).
– Individual cognitive-behavioural therapy. Selfhelp CBT and structured group physical activity
are recommended by NICE for mild depression
(2011). Dialectical behaviour therapy is a
psychological therapy for borderline personality
disorder. Graded exposure therapy is used to treat
obsessive-compulsive disease and phobias.

– If one parent has schizophrenia, the probability of
their offspring having schizophrenia is 13%. The
population lifetime risk is 1%. See Fig. 19.1.
– If both parents have schizophrenia, the probability
of their offspring having schizophrenia is 50%.
The population lifetime risk is 1%. See Fig. 19.1.
– This is a difficult question as there is little solid
evidence about the optimum period of treatment
for a first episode of psychosis. Without
prophylactic antipsychotics following a first
episode of schizophrenia, over half of patients will
relapse within a year. The current
recommendation is to continue antipsychotics for
1–2 years after a first episode. However, many
patients wish to stop sooner. In this case, a gradual
reduction over a few weeks reduces the risk of
relapse. Alternatively, this man may prefer to
switch to an antipsychotic less associated with
weight gain.
– Cognitive-behavioural therapy. The other
modalities are not recommended in
schizophrenia. Family therapy is also
recommended if the patient lives with or is in close
contact with their family.
– Temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiratory
rate should be checked every 5–10 minutes
following any parenteral administration of rapid
tranquillization. Observations should be every 5–10
minutes for 1 hour, then every half hour until the
patient is able to walk. If the patient refuses or
remains too behaviourally disturbed to allow
observations, they should be regularly observed for

respiratory effort, airway and consciousness level. If
the patient has received haloperidol or is at high risk
of arrhythmia for other reasons, ECG monitoring is
also advised. See Fig. 19.3.
– Hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia is unlikely –
hyperglycaemia secondary to stress would be
expected. She is at increased risk of all the other
options: benzodiazepines can cause respiratory
depression, over-sedation by any means can cause
loss of airway, antipsychotics and hyperarousal
increase the risk of arrhythmia and
benzodiazepines and antipsychotics can both
cause hypotension. Further complications of
antipsychotic use include seizures and dystonias.
All these complications can occur with oral
formulations also, but are more likely when large
doses are given via a fast acting method.

– Social phobia and OCD have roughly equal
prevalence in men and women. All other anxiety
disorders, and depression, are more common in
women.
– Around half of patients with post-traumatic stress
disorder will recover fully within 3 months.
Around half of patients with panic disorder will
recover fully within 3 years. The other anxiety
disorders are more likely to have a chronic course.
– Specific phobia. SSRI is the first line
pharmacological option for moderate to severe
forms of all other anxiety disorders (for PTSD,
mirtazapine is an alternative first line treatment).
This man has a severe disorder in view of the
impact of his symptoms on his ability to work.
– Seeing patients with anxiety about their physical
health on a regular basis can help contain their
anxieties and reduce the total number and
number of urgent appointments they need.
However, this does not mean they should not be
allowed access to urgent appointment slots – they
will experience physical health problems along
with somatization. Similarly, investigations should
be carefully considered and avoided if possible,
but some are likely to still be required to safely
exclude other disorders. Benzodiazepines are not
indicated for somatization disorder, but may be
indicated for some other reason. The nature of
somatization disorder should be explained to
patients, but it should not be done in a
confrontational manner. Phrases such as ‘all in the
mind’ should be avoided as patients are genuinely
experiencing symptoms. See Fig. 20.4.

– Cognitive-behavioural therapy with

mild to severe functional impairment. Traumafocused CBT is for post-traumatic stress disorder.
PRN diazepam would not be advisable given she is
likely to come into contact with bodily fluids on a
daily basis. SSRIs are not recommended for
specific phobias.
– An SSRI is the first line drug therapy for obsessivecompulsive disorder. Clomipramine is a second line
drug therapy. Mirtazapine and pregabalin are not
recommended by current guidelines. Self-help is
recommended for mild symptoms but this woman’s
symptoms are associated with marked functional
impairment. Talking therapies are first line for
moderate to severe OCD and she should be
encouraged to reconsider a talking therapy if a SSRI
is ineffective.

– This man is currently contemplating changing his
behaviour. He recognizes the need for change (he
wants to give up), but is ambivalent about it
(worrying he will lose all his friends). Motivational
interviewing may be helpful to allow him to
progress to the next stage of preparation for
change.
– Prior to prescribing methadone, it is essential
to confirm the use of opiates. A urine drug
test can be used to do this. Admission to
psychiatric hospital is not necessary, although
dose titration should be undertaken in a
controlled clinical environment with facilities to
measure physiological response to opiates, and
with emergency treatment for opiate toxicity
(i.e. naloxone) close to hand. Viral serology
testing and physical examination is important
screening for health complications from
intravenous drug use, but is not necessary for
a methadone prescription. Forcing a patient
to identify a confidant for the purposes of
corroboration can lead to problems, either
placing false security in a possibly inaccurate
historian, or causing disengagement
with services.
– Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is frequently
(legitimately) prescribed. However, unlawful
possession (i.e. without a prescription) or
unauthorized supply (i.e. someone who is
prescribed the drug selling/giving it to someone
without a prescription) is an offence.
Methylphenidate is considered to be a Class B

drug under the Act, therefore supplying/dealing
can result in a maximum of 14 years custodial
sentence, or an unlimited fine, or both. Heroin
(diamorphine) used to be prescribed as an
analgesic but is generally avoided now.
– Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist. This
may control cravings, and reduces the pleasurable
effects of drinking alcohol, reducing ‘reward’ and
– by operant conditioning – can ‘extinguish’ the
desire to drink (the ‘Sinclair method’). Disulfiram
causes an unpleasant reaction when taken with
alcohol. Acamprosate may be helpful in
controlling cravings. Long-term antidepressants
or benzodiazepines are not recommended for the
sole purpose of maintaining abstinence; however,
antidepressants may be helpful for treating
comorbid depression.
– A needle exchange service, where users can
obtain clean syringes, hypodermics and
preparation equipment, has the role of reducing
the risks of injecting (not the risks of the drug
itself). Therefore this is an example of a ‘harm
reduction service.
– Buprenorphine (Subutex) is a partial opioid
agonist, and can be used for substitution therapy.
The other drugs can be used in treating various
stages of opiate dependence; however, none are
true ‘substitutes’.

– Patients with borderline personality disorder
require far longer durations of treatment than
those with depression, and therefore are far
costlier to treat. The prevalence of comorbid
substance misuse is incredibly high in patients with
borderline personality disorder, and the lifetime
risk of completing suicide is also very high (1 in 10
sufferers of borderline personality disorder will
complete suicide). Borderline personality disorder
patients also tend to be more difficult to engage in
psychotherapy, and are usually far less responsive
to treatment with antidepressants than patients
with depression.
– In the treatment of patients with antisocial
personality disorder, a history of violence
towards others is a predictor of a negative
treatment outcome. Other factors associated
with a negative response include: history of arrest
and conviction for a crime; a history of repeated
lying, confidence tricks or the use of aliases;
unresolved legal situations on admission;
hospitalization as an alternative to imprisonment;
and the presence of an organic brain disorder.
Predictors of a positive response to therapy

include the presence of anxiety, diagnosis of
depression and diagnosis of psychosis (other than
organic conditions).
The Cochrane Collaboration systematic review
included 27 randomized controlled trials. As well
as showing that flupentixol decanoate (depot)
reduced suicidal behaviour, it concluded that
current evidence from RCTs suggested that drug
treatment – especially mood stabilizers
(topiramate, lamotrigine, valproate semisodium)
and the second generation antipsychotics
olanzapine and aripiprazole – may be effective in
treating a number of core symptoms and
associated psychopathology of borderline
personality disorder. However, it acknowledged
that the clinical evidence did not currently support
effectiveness for any drug treatment in reducing
the overall severity of borderline personality
disorder, and recommended that
pharmacotherapy should be targeted at specific
symptoms.
Psychodynamic psychotherapy is intentionally
unstructured, and agendas are never set by the
therapist. This is to allow exploration of what is
(unconsciously) important to the patient without
interference.
Consideration should be given to the ‘weekly
dispensing’ of any prescribed medication, to avoid
the patient having immediate access to large
quantities of potentially harmful drugs which they
may impulsively take in overdose. Psychological
therapies can be helpful, even during periods of
acute illness. Care plans may need to be changed
to allow for increased support during periods of
depression. Benzodiazepines should be avoided if
possible, due to the risk of dependence or misuse.
Admission to a psychiatric ward may be necessary
to manage risk or to treat severe illness; however,
this can prove counterproductive and other
measures should be considered in the first
instance.
Given the significant risk to another person,
confidentiality needs to be broken in this case.
The psychiatrist has a duty to immediately
warn the police. Also, the specific and detailed
content of the threat necessitates that the
intended victim be warned (see the Tarasoff
case for further details). The responsibility
for this falls on the doctor; however, in practice
the police will usually be happy to facilitate
this. Detention under mental health legislation
would not be appropriate, as the threat
should be addressed by law enforcement
agencies in the first instance. Meticulous
notes would need to be kept. It is likely that
he would be held criminally responsible for
his actions.

– Around 5% (1 in 20) of the female population
have eating habits that give cause for concern.
Most of these women are between the ages of 14
and 25 years. Anorexia nervosa, and indeed
eating disorders in general, are about 10 times
more common in females than males. About 0.5–
1% have a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Anorexia
nervosa used to be considered to be more
common in higher socioeconomic classes;
however, the evidence for this is variable and
continues to be debated (both anorexia
nervosa and bulimia nervosa are thought
probably to have an equal prevalence across
socioeconomic classes). Eating disorders are
more common in gymnasts, ballet dancers and
athletes.
– Bulimia nervosa is commonly associated with a
long history of exposure to dieting behaviour.
There is subsequently often a history of childhood
obesity, parental obesity and early menarche.
Genetic factors are thought to play a significant
role in the aetiology of bulimia nervosa although
individual genes have not yet been identified.
Family enmeshment (over-involvement between
parent and child) is more commonly associated
with anorexia nervosa, and sufferers of bulimia
nervosa often have conflict-ridden family
dynamics. Substance misuse is a common
comorbidity in bulimia nervosa. Previously, a
history of childhood sexual abuse was thought to
be common in individuals with bulimia nervosa;
however, recent studies have shown that rates of
this are about the same as for other mental
illnesses, suggesting that it is a general risk factor
for all mental illnesses rather than just bulimia
nervosa.
– Personality traits commonly seen in individuals
with anorexia nervosa include perfectionism,
harm-avoidance, inhibition and obsessionality.
Novelty-seeking personality traits are associated
with impulsivity and often recklessness, and are
more frequently seen in patients with addictions.
– Motivational interviewing would probably be the
most useful in the first instance. He does not feel
that there is a problem; however, the fact that he
is agreeable to meeting a therapist is suggestive
that he may have some ambivalence.
Motivational interviewing uses Prochaska and
DiClemente’s Transtheoretical Model of Change,
and focuses on helping patients consider the need
to change behaviour. All the other modalities may
be useful in treating the illness, and should be
considered once he feels that he is ready to
change his behaviour.

– The presence of binge–purge symptoms are
associated with a poorer prognosis in sufferers of
anorexia nervosa, as is late age of onset, very low
weight (not rapid weight loss), long duration of
illness, personality difficulties, difficult family
relationships and poor social adjustment. The
presence of a family history of anorexia is not
necessarily indicative of poor prognosis, neither is
the rate of engagement with psychotherapy.

– While ‘mood swings’ are thought to be a common
symptom of the premenstrual syndrome, elevated
mood is not. If a woman presents with elevated
mood and a cyclical pattern of symptoms,
diagnoses such as bipolar affective disorder,
cyclothymia or substance use should be
considered.
– While the woman in the case description attributes
her symptoms to the menopause, the duration of
the symptoms accompanied by the presence of
suicidal thoughts are more suggestive of a
depressive illness. Around the menopausal years,
there can be an increase in psychosocial stressors
(children leaving home, ‘facing up’ to growing
older, changes in personal relationships, etc.),
which may increase the risk of developing
depression independently of the hormonal
changes that arise during the menopause. Thus,
psychological therapies and social supports may
be helpful. Hormone replacement therapy can be
useful in certain circumstances; however, it does
not suit everyone, and should not be used as a
substitute for a recognized antidepressant in the
management of major depression. The use of
omega-3 fish oils as treatment for depression
during the menopause is currently being studied,
but at the time of writing there is insufficient
evidence to support this. Dietary and lifestyle
advice (avoiding alcohol, tobacco, eating a
balanced diet, exercising) should be given to all
patients who report low mood.
– Lithium is thought to be teratogenic, and is
probably associated with the development of
Ebstein’s anomaly (a congenital heart defect).
While the relative risk is increased, the absolute
risk still remains fairly low. This needs to be
balanced with the individual risk of relapse on
stopping lithium (as acute mental illness and
associated risk-taking behaviours or acute phase
drug treatment are likely to have a profound
effect on the fetus). Discussion of risks and

265

benefits of stopping vs not stopping the lithium
can help women make informed choices.
Ultimately, the doctor is responsible for
prescribing the drug, but this should be in the best
interests of the patient, and therefore the decision
should be made jointly. If lithium is continued, the
dose will need carefully monitored (as changes in
body water during pregnancy can affect levels).
Sodium valproate carries a much higher risk of
teratogenicity, and should be avoided during
pregnancy. This woman is at high risk of relapse
should she become pregnant and should be
referred to perinatal psychiatry services prior to
conception.
– Reassurance that she will not become unwell
cannot be given. This lady has a history of
postnatal depression and is at greatly increased
risk of suffering a further episode. She should be
referred to the perinatal mental health team.
Given this history, and also her good response to
medications in the past, commencing
antidepressant treatment later in pregnancy or in
the early postpartum may be beneficial. The
perinatal mental health team would explore the
risks vs benefits of this option. When choosing an
agent, consideration should be given to previously
effective drugs, and the mother’s choice to breast
feed.
– A troubled relationship is not thought to be a
major risk factor for puerperal psychosis;
however, it is a risk factor for postnatal
depression. The rest of the list above are
considered to be risk factors for the development
of puerperal psychosis.

– Aromatherapy. This woman has a behavioural and
psychological symptom of dementia. Nonpharmacological options are recommended as first
line by NICE (2010), unless there is immediate risk
of harm or severe distress. Referral to speech and
language therapy is unlikely to be of benefit given
her severe dementia.
– Vascular and Alzheimer’s dementia. Vascular risk
factors are important for both these dementias.
– Antipsychotics. Antipsychotics can cause
irreversible severe parkinsonian reactions in
patients with Lewy body dementia. The other
options may all potentially be of benefit – if his
delusion is due to concurrent infection
(antibiotics), depression (antidepressants) or
worsening dementia – cholinesterase inhibitors
can improve behavioural and psychological
symptoms of dementia. Nutritional supplements

may be of benefit whatever the cause if he is
losing weight.
– Co-codamol. This contains both codeine and
paracetamol. Opiates are very common causes of
delirium in older adults. Opiates are often started
during acute admissions for pain or surgery.
– Acute medical ward. This lady is delirious. This is a
medical emergency. She needs to be fully
physically investigated. Her acute onset psychotic
symptoms are almost certainly due to her delirium,
not a psychiatric disorder.

– Antidepressant. The key issue here is the
diagnosis. She presents with a common triad in
older adults: depressive symptoms, cognitive
impairment and functional impairment. It is often
difficult to tease out whether someone is
experiencing a pseudodementia (depression
manifesting as dementia) or an early dementia
leading to comorbid depression. Ideally
depression is treated first, then cognition
reassessed once mood is euthymic. An
antidepressant would be preferable to counselling
for treating depression in this lady as her cognitive
impairment is likely to limit the benefit of
psychological therapies.
– Depressive episode. It is common for depression to
manifest with prominent features of anxiety,
psychomotor agitation and hypochondriacal ideas
in older adults. Mild cognitive impairment is the
next most likely differential – although her MMSE
of 28/30 is reassuring, a more sensitive test such as
the ACE-R may still show an objective impairment.
Generalized anxiety disorder or hypochondriacal
disorder are unlikely to have onset so late in life,
and diagnosis would require a longer duration of
symptoms. There are no psychotic features to

– ECT. All of the suggested management strategies
are reasonable but ECT is preferable because of
this man’s potentially life-threatening poor oral
intake and poor concordance. Depot medication
would get round the concordance problem but is
not as effective as ECT and would take longer to
work. ECT is the quickest and most effective
treatment for depression known and seems to
work particularly well in older adults.
– All of these patients could potentially have late
onset schizophrenia. However, symptoms of late
onset schizophrenia are predominantly delusional,
rather than bizarre or negative symptoms (as in
patients A and C). Patient D is more likely to have
Charles Bonnet syndrome (see p. 67). Late onset

schizophrenia is far more common in women than
men, and social deprivation and hearing
impairment are also risk factors.
Continue mirtazapine for at least 8 weeks. Older
adults can take longer to show response to
antidepressants, so an adequate trial is at least
8 weeks. Augmentation is not necessary at this
stage and increases the risk of drug interactions.
Tricyclics are best avoided in older adults because
of dangerous side-effects.
Delirium. This lady has acute onset cognitive
impairment: delirium until proven otherwise. The
history is concerningly suggestive of a focal seizure.
She needs admitted to a medical ward for
investigation. A manic or hypomanic episode
would be highly unlikely to have such a rapid onset.
Were she on lithium, it would be crucial to check a
random lithium level as her presentation could also
be due to lithium toxicity.
This is the simplest and easiest of the options. If
concordance remains poor despite this, prompting
by a carer could be considered. A depot could be
useful if the patient wishes it, or his insight reduces
and he requires compulsory treatment. Daily
dispensing is normally reserved for methadone or
for those at high risk of overdose. In general,
simplifying medication regimes to once daily is a
good idea, but unfortunately olanzapine is likely
to be too sedating to allow use in the mornings.
Potentially his other once daily medication could
be changed to the evening.
Refer for urgent psychiatric review. This lady has
recently attempted to commit suicide. Older adults
are at high risk of completed suicide. She may
perceive taking extra benzodiazepines as far more
harmful than they actually are, as she may have
memories of barbiturates – highly toxic sleeping
tablets which were fatal in minor overdose. Her
ongoing intent is unclear from the vignette. She
may require admission or urgent community
support from mental health services.

– According to DSM-IV, some of the core symptoms
need to be present before the age of 7 years to
make the diagnosis of ADHD. This is not to say
that ADHD cannot be diagnosed in children older
than 7 years: often, it is not diagnosed until their
behaviour causes problems in school or other
situations.

or in cognitive development and intelligence.
Indeed, IQ and language may be superior in
some cases.
– Rett’s syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder,
and so it occurs almost exclusively in girls. All other
pervasive developmental disorders are more
common in boys.
– Conduct disorder is associated with the
development of antisocial personality disorder,
criminality and substance misuse in later life. It is
approximately four times as common in boys than
girls. Oppositional defiant disorder is often
considered to be a ‘milder’ variant of conduct
disorder, where defiant behaviour is
characteristic, but this tends not to involve
criminality or violating the rights of others.
Truancy, as opposed to school refusal, is
commonly seen.
– Normally, the age criterion used to define enuresis
in children is 5 years old, in children whose
chronological age corresponds with their
development. It is thought that, by this stage,
children should have established consistent
bladder control.
– Given the effectiveness of first generation
antipsychotics (dopamine antagonists) in
reducing tics, functional excess of dopamine is
thought to be implicated in the aetiology of tic
disorders.
– Vaginal trauma and genital warts are not normal
in an 8-year-old girl, and the findings should
immediately raise suspicions of sexual abuse. The
safety of the child is paramount, and steps should
be taken to maintain this. While protocols vary
slightly between areas, child protection
procedures usually advise contacting the duty
social worker and/or the local paediatrician
on-call for child protection. If in any doubt
about a possible child protection concern,
either of these parties will usually be more than
happy to offer guidance. The child should not
be directly asked about what happened at this
stage: a formal interview needs to be arranged
involving police, social work and paediatric
staff. Police will not question the girl just now.
Parents should never be ‘confronted’ by medical
staff; however, it is obviously courteous (if
possible) to let them know what is going on and
what will happen next. The child should not be
allowed home until all relevant agencies are
involved and safety at home can be ensured.
This may not be possible, and an alternative place
of safety may have to be sought. Should the
parent remove the child from safety, it would
be appropriate to contact the police given the
magnitude of the concerns.

guide management. Psychotropic medication can
be helpful, but should be given in conjunction

Admission to a specialist unit may be required in

– Profound intellectual disabilities are diagnosed
when IQ is estimated to be less than 20. These
people comprise about 1–2% of all people with
intellectual disabilities. They are severely limited in
their abilities, often have severe motor
impairment, and invariably need nursing care in
adulthood – usually in a residential setting.
However, they can be diagnosed with depression,
can benefit from behavioural therapies and
aetiology is (more often than not) known.
– From the list given, Alzheimer’s disease is the most
commonly diagnosed mental disorder in patients
with Down’s syndrome. This is thought to be
because of the triplication of chromosome 21, and
the subsequent over-expression of the amyloid
precursor protein which is located on
chromosome 21.
– Fragile X syndrome is the most common singlegene cause of autism, and the most common
inherited cause of intellectual disability. It is
caused by the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide
repeat affecting the Fragile X mental retardation 1
(or FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. Because
men have only one X chromosome they are more
severely affected by the mutation. It results in a
spectrum of intellectual disability ranging from
mild to severe, as well as physical characteristics
such as an elongated face, large or protruding
ears, and larger testes (macroorchidism),
behavioural characteristics such as stereotypical
movements (e.g. hand-flapping), and social
anxiety.
– Individuals with moderate intellectual disabilities
have limited (but not absent) language and
comprehension skills. Some can sustain
employment if well supported: usually simple
practical work. They tend to require some
assistance with self-care and supported living but
do not tend to need full-time nursing care.
– Simple psychosocial and environmental
interventions often have long-term benefits.
When a behavioural disturbance occurs in an
individual with intellectual disability, it is
important to consider what may have changed in
their life. This may include changes to
accommodation or carers, changes to routine or
social circumstances, changes in the family (e.g.
divorce, bereavement), physical illness (e.g.
toothache, constipation). Behavioural
disturbances can be associated with the onset of
comorbid mental illness, but this is less common.
The aetiology of the intellectual disability can help

– An individual being considered unfit to plead
through mental illness is relatively uncommon. In
England and Wales, fitness to plead is determined
by the Pritchard criteria (the M’Naghten Rule
applies to mens rea, and being not guilty by
reason of insanity at the time of the alleged
offence, which is a different concept). Amnesia
for the offence does not mean that the accused
cannot stand trial (although someone who is
unfit to plead might also have amnesia for the
offence). While not always the case, the court
will usually recommend that the accused is
transferred to a secure psychiatric hospital for
assessment and/or treatment.
– Among stalkers with psychotic disorders,
delusions of love are most commonly present. This
is known as erotomania or De Clerambault
syndrome, and is characterized by the abnormal
belief that the subject of the stalking is in love with
the perpetrator. Approximately one in three
members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists
have experienced stalking behaviours that met
the legal definition of harassment.
– Exhibitionism is considered as a psychiatric
disorder by ICD-10, under the classification of
paraphilia. It rarely immediately precedes violent
sexual assault. Individuals with intellectual
disability are over-represented in the statistics,
although this may reflect the fact that the
perpetrator is often known to the victim and
therefore the rate of detection is high. Recidivism
(re-offending) rates are fairly low, although those
who do are more likely to commit more serious
sexual crimes in the future.
– Command hallucinations are associated with an
increased risk of violence in patients with
schizophrenia. People with psychotic disorders are
approximately eight times more likely than
members of the general public to acquire
convictions for violent offences. There is no strong
association between sexual offending and active
psychotic symptoms. Comorbid substance misuse
significantly increases the risk of violent offending
in patients with psychotic disorder. There are far

higher arrest rates among psychiatrically ill
patients than offenders without mental illness.
– Murder is the only charge for which diminished
responsibility may apply. If the accused is found to
have diminished responsibility, the conviction is

Scotland). This was particularly important
historically when murder carried the death penalty.

– Propranolol. This woman is probably experiencing
akathisia. This is hard to treat but propranolol or
benzodiazepines can help. See Fig. 2.10. Ideally
the dose of antipsychotic is reduced. Quinine can
be used for restless leg syndrome when in bed.
The differential includes agitation secondary to
psychosis.
– Intramuscular procyclidine. This woman is
experiencing a dystonia with an oculogyric crisis
and trismus. Her clenched jaw means oral
procyclidine is not possible. Baclofen and
dantrolene are for chronic spasticity.
– Rescuscitation. This woman is acutely unwell. She
needs ABC and probably a peri-arrest call/999
ambulance. She may have neuroleptic malignant
syndrome, or a range of other differentials (e.g.
meningitis, substance intoxication). Dantrolene is
not an emergency treatment and is not indicated
until the diagnosis is clearer.
– Oral procyclidine. This man has drug-induced
parkinsonism. In the early stages the features are
different to idiopathic parkinsonism.
Anticholinergics can help but ideally the dose of
antipsychotic would be reduced or an alternative
antipsychotic trialled.
– Stop anticholinergics. This man has tardive
dyskinesia. This is hard to treat but stopping
anticholinergics (in this case procyclidine) and
reducing or withdrawing antipsychotics if possible
can help.

– This is an example of acting out: behaving in a
certain way in order to express thoughts or

patient’s past.
– Catharsis is a Greek word meaning ‘cleansing’ or
‘purging’. It is often used to describe a feeling of

– Parapraxis is a term used to describe an error of

may be due to the interference of repressed
thoughts and unconscious features of the

individual’s personality. It is referred to in
common culture as a ‘slip of the tongue’ or a
‘Freudian slip’.

– Mentalization is the process by which we implicitly
and explicitly interpret the actions of ourselves and
others as meaningful on the basis of intentional
mental states. Mentalization-based therapy is a
treatment intended to improve the capacity to
mentalize, which is often a specific difficulty in
those with borderline personality disorder. This is
thought to improve emotional regulation and
interpersonal relationships.
– Interpersonal therapy is based on the assumptions
that problems with interpersonal relationships and
social functioning contribute significantly to
mental illness. Main areas of focus include role
disputes, role transitions, interpersonal deficits
and grief.
– Systematic desensitization is a type of behavioural
therapy that can be useful in the treatment of
phobias. It involves compilation of a hierarchy of
phobic stimuli (e.g. standing at the front door,
going into the garden, going to the end of the
street, going to the supermarket) and – with
support from the therapist and the use of
appropriate relaxation techniques – working
through the hierarchy in order to face increasingly
anxiety-provoking scenarios.
– Cognitive-behavioural therapy can be useful in the
treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. The
‘wiggly finger’ type of therapy that the gentleman
in the scenario describes is eye movement
desensitization and reprocessing, which can also
be helpful for some; however, evidently not in
this case.
– Exposure and response prevention is a type of
behavioural therapy in which the patient is
encouraged not to respond to the obsessional
thought with a compulsive act. Relaxation
techniques are used instead to overcome the
anxiety associated with not carrying out the
compulsion.

– Borderline personality disorder. She is a young
woman with a long history of self-harm,
difficulties with interpersonal relationships and
auditory pseudohallucinations at times of stress.
Of note, she has no symptoms suggestive of a
depressive illness.
– Severe depression with psychotic features.
This man has made a serious suicide attempt.
Note that he went to some effort to prevent
discovery (remote location, unsocial hour) and
made acts of closure (typed letters implies that
some thought had gone into these). He has
biological and psychotic symptoms of depression.
He may have intoxicated himself to reduce his
inhibitions prior to the act and is not necessarily
alcohol dependent.
– Mania with psychosis. This young man’s
self-inflicted injuries are in keeping with his
grandiose beliefs (of a religious nature), of which
he is entirely convinced. He is disinhibited and
feels that he has special powers. He also exhibits
flight of ideas on mental state examination.
Important differential diagnoses in this case would
be a drug-induced state, or an organic illness.
– Recurrent depressive disorder of moderate
severity would be the most fitting of the listed
diagnoses. Note the pattern of previous periods of
illness, punctuated by periods of relatively good
functioning. There is no mention of psychotic
symptoms, and drugs or alcohol are not thought
to be implicated.
– Anorexia nervosa. Although a full history and
physical examination would be required to
definitively establish this diagnosis, the patient’s
history and presentation is fairly typical of a
serious eating disorder. Note the baggy clothes
and the ‘lanugo’ hair. Anorexia nervosa is much
more common in females, but males also suffer
from it.

– Overdoses of medicinal drugs account for
80–90% of self-harm presentations to hospitals in
the UK.
– This was previously a relatively common method of
suicide, as domestic gas was derived from coal. This
had a high concentration of carbon monoxide,
which meant it was regularly fatal. Since the 1960s,
‘natural’ gas has been used, which is non-toxic.
However, because an oven is a very enclosed
space, the presence of any gas is likely to displace
oxygen and therefore there is a risk of asphyxia.

– Self-inflicted firearm injuries are the most common
method of suicide in males in the USA. In the UK,
suicide by firearm is much more common in farmers,
who often have (legitimate) access to them.
– Ingestion of as little as 10 mL of methyl alcohol
(methylated spirits) can result in blindness by
destruction of the optic nerve.
– Suspension hanging is a method in which a ligature is
secured in a ‘noose’, placed around the neck, and the
other end attached to a fixed point. Upon the
application of weight, the noose tightens around the
neck, occluding the jugular veins, carotid arteries, and
(if heavy enough) the trachea. This results in death by
strangulation, as opposed to ‘drop hanging’, where
the goal is typically to cause traumatic (usually fatal)
spinal cord injury. In prisons, the ligature used is
usually fashioned from bed-sheets, and attached to
the cell bars or a door handle. Note that full suspension
(i.e. entire body weight) is not required to be fatal, and
that it is often used in the sitting or kneeling position,
and can even be effective when supine.

– An admission to a medical/short stay ward is
necessary, with a psychiatric evaluation when he
sobers up. He is currently too intoxicated (with drugs
and alcohol) to undertake an adequate mental state
examination and risk assessment. Discharging a
patient in this state is unacceptable, as he is at risk of
not only committing further acts of self-harm, but of
medical complications from his intoxication. He is
also possibly unable to look after himself and could
be vulnerable from exploitation or accidents.
– This lady should be discharged to police custody. Her
overdose does not appear to have been with strong
suicidal intent (she was found in the street), and she
is exhibiting drug-seeking and manipulative
behaviour. While many patients like this do not
require police involvement, she has committed
physical, verbal, and racial assaults on healthcare
workers, and needs to face consequences for these
actions. Admission to a psychiatric ward is unlikely to
be beneficial, and may even prove detrimental by
reinforcing the suggestion that behaviour of this
nature is driven by mental illness.
– This gentleman should be referred for semi-urgent
(later in the week) input from the community
mental health team. He is likely to be suffering from
a depressive illness, probably precipitated by
financial and employment difficulties. While he is
clearly remorseful about his suicidal behaviour, he
appears to be struggling with his current situation
and could well benefit from input by the community
mental health team. He has a concerned and

supportive wife and a relatively stable domestic
situation, which is why immediate outreach team
involvement is not necessary at present.
– This lady most likely requires admission to a
psychiatric ward for further assessment and
management of her mental state and risk. Should
she refuse, use of mental health legislation may
need to be considered. Despite the overdose being
relatively small, this is likely due to lack of
knowledge and there appears to have been clear
suicidal intent. First presentations of self-harm in
older adults should be considered to be with suicidal
intent unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.
Intensive outreach support in this case would be
inappropriate given the very high risk of imminent
further acts, despite her pleas that she will be fine.
– Discharge with information on non-NHS support
services. Despite her history and diagnosis, this
woman appears to be functioning at a relatively
high level (studying, not self-harming until recent
stressors). She has made it clear that she is not
wishing mental health service input; however, it
could be that she would benefit greatly from nonNHS resources. Information on local student
support agencies or voluntary support services for
people who self-harm should be offered. Most of
these agencies accept self-referrals, and distribute
leaflets to local mental health bases.

– Dysthymia. This man describes subsyndromal
symptoms of depression which emerged in
adulthood and do not significantly interfere with
his functioning. The lack of discrete episodes
excludes recurrent depressive disorder.
– Mild depressive episode. This woman has two out
of three of the core symptoms of depression, poor
concentration and poor self-esteem. There are no
biological symptoms mentioned. She has four
symptoms of depression in total and is able to
continue her normal activities, meeting criteria for
mild depression.
– Severe depression with psychotic features. This
woman has a clear change in functioning from her
baseline, psychomotor retardation and what may
be olfactory hallucinations of foul smells leading to
the secondary delusional belief that her
neighbour’s drains are clogged. Although her
mood is not reported, she is at risk of depression
following a bereavement and these hallucinations
are typical of severe depression.

symptoms of depression and two further
symptoms (disturbed sleep and appetite). This

use. This would normally be diagnosed as harmful
use of alcohol (see Ch. 15). This man gives a clear
history of low mood following alcohol excess. This
is impacting upon his mental health and
occupational functioning. He is easily able to
abstain from drink, indicating he is not dependent.

– Cushing’s disease is an excess of cortisol. It can

– Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant

Increased clumsiness and poor coordination can be
subtle early features of the movement disorder
which progresses to marked ataxia with choreiform
movements (see p. 108). Huntington’s disease is
not always talked about in families and the
description of the patient’s father is more typical of
the course of Huntington’s than of depression.

fatigue, low mood, dry, thin hair, dry skin and

– Hypomanic episode. This man describes elated
mood with a decreased need for sleep, poor
concentration, increased energy, increased
recent expenditure and increased libido. It is
interfering with his social and occupational
functioning but these activities are not
completely disrupted. We are not given
information on past mood abnormalities so the
diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder is not
appropriate.
– Manic episode with psychotic features. This man
has irritable mood, sexual disinhibition and
grandiose delusions which have led him to commit
an offence and quit his career. Schizophrenia is
made less likely by the presence of mood
symptoms and disinhibition. It would be
important to check a urine drug screen to exclude
mania secondary to psychoactive substance use.
We are not given information on past mood
abnormalities so the diagnosis of bipolar affective

periods of mild elation and mild depression since
early adulthood which do not impact on her
functioning.

– L-dopa. This man probably has Parkinson’s disease
and is likely to be treated with dopaminergic
agents such as L-dopa, a precursor to dopamine.
Excess dopamine is associated with euphoria,
psychosis and a reduction in impulse control. Note
it is the treatment rather than Parkinson’s disease
itself which is associated with these symptoms.
– Amfetamine. Amfetamine intoxication can be
associated with an acute psychosis. It is a
sympathomimetic and so associated with dilated
pupils. Cocaine can have similar effects but is
normally smoked or snorted.
– Anabolic steroids. These are commonly used by
bodybuilders to increase muscle bulk, but can be
associated with changes in mood, arousal and
cognition.

– Schizophrenia. This man describes the symptom of
thought insertion for greater than 1 month. The
diagnosis is supported by his age and functional
decline prior to the onset of symptoms. Although his
mother does not think he misuses substances it
would be important to exclude this by asking
the man himself and performing a urine drug screen.
– Schizoaffective disorder. This man has concurrent
mood symptoms and first rank symptoms of
schizophrenia. His mood and psychotic symptoms
are equally prominent, making a recurrent
psychotic depression unlikely.
– Depressive episode, severe, with psychotic
features. This man has mood symptoms and
psychotic symptoms which are not typical of
schizophrenia (because they are second rather than
third person). The mood symptoms appear to be
more prominent than the psychotic symptoms,
making schizoaffective disorder unlikely.
– Delusional disorder. This man has a longstanding
unshakeable belief arrived at through faulty
reasoning: a delusion. He has insight into this.
Schizophrenia is unlikely because the delusion is
non-bizarre and functioning is intact.
– Personality disorder (although a fuller personal
history would be required to confirm this
diagnosis). This man is not delusional as his
belief is not fixed. He is suspicious and litigious.
The history from the police of multiple previous calls
suggests his difficulties are longstanding. This
would be consistent with a paranoid personality
disorder. However, a fuller background history
would be required to make a definite diagnosis.

– Dementia/delirium. This man has cognitive
impairment, functional decline and auditory
hallucinations. It is crucial to exclude delirium by
clarifying the onset of these symptoms (acute or
chronic), by assessing his consciousness level and
by completing a full physical examination and
basic investigations. Dementia can also be
associated with hallucinations. A mood disorder is
made less likely by the description of him as
‘cheerful’, but otherwise a severe depressive
episode could also account for his symptoms.
Schizophrenia is unlikely to have such late onset.

– Neurosyphilis. This is now a rare diagnosis in the
UK, but should always be considered in those with
work or travel histories that may have placed them
at risk of contracting syphilis. Neurosyphilis is a
type of tertiary syphilis that emerges several years
after initial infection. Clinical features are diverse
but can include personality change, grandiose
behaviour and dementia, along with upper motor
neurone abnormalities such as brisk reflexes and
extensor plantars.
– Cerebral tumour. This man is socially disinhibited
with a headache suggestive of raised intracranial
pressure. The presence of focal neurological
signs would further support the diagnosis.
– Vitamin B12 deficiency. As a vegan, this woman is
at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency (which is present
only in meat and dairy products). She describes
ataxia and paranoia, both of which can be features
of vitamin B12 deficiency.
– Thiamine deficiency. This man is likely experiencing
Wernicke’s encephalopathy. He is experiencing
visual hallucinations and possibly tactile
hallucinations of insects beneath the skin
(formication). He is ataxic and has nystagmus. Thus
he has the classic triad for Wernicke’s: confusion,
ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. Although this man’s
alcohol history is unknown, the time course of
these symptoms is consistent with the onset of
alcohol withdrawal and alcohol use may have
predisposed him to being in a road traffic accident.

– Social phobia. This man has a generalized social
phobia shown by his avoidance of social
situations, and marked anxiety and distress when
in them.
– Generalized anxiety disorder. This lady has
experienced continuous anxiety and
apprehension about minor matters associated
with autonomic overactivity and muscle tension
for over 6 months.
– Agoraphobia with panic disorder. This lady had a
panic attack in a supermarket and has now
become increasingly avoidant of crowding and
confinement. Her symptoms are restricted to
these situations. The weight loss may well be
explained by her reduced dietary intake and
increased exercise, but other disorders should be
screened for, for example, hyperthyroidism.
– Panic disorder. This man reports repeated
non-situational panic attacks including a sensation
of derealization. His symptoms could be due to
cardiac problems but his young age, lack of
exercise-induced symptoms and normal ECG are
reassuring.
– Social phobia (specific to playing a musical
instrument in concert). This man has a social
phobia as shown by his situation-specific anxiety
and avoidance. This is not a generalized social
phobia but is limited to one specific situation.
DSM-IV codes for generalized and specific social
phobias whereas ICD-10 does not differentiate.
– Depressive episode. This man has the three core
symptoms of depression and two further
biological symptoms. His anxiety symptoms are
concurrent with his depression so the primary
diagnosis is of a depressive disorder rather than an
anxiety disorder. Although his symptoms had
onset following a traumatic event, they are too
prolonged to be an acute stress reaction, too
severe to be an adjustment disorder, and he
denies two of the three key symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (flashbacks, avoidance
and hyperarousal).

– Eating disorder. This woman’s low body weight,
self-induced weight loss, body image disturbance
and amenorrhoea mean she meets criteria for
anorexia nervosa. She is not experiencing
obsessions as she describes ego-syntonic thoughts
which she does not resist. Rather they are overvalued ideas as they are plausible beliefs which
have come to dominate her life.

1. B

– Obsession. The patient knows the images
originate from their mind and is trying to resist.
– Over-valued idea. The fear of infection is logical
but held with undue importance. It is not an
obsession as it is not viewed as abnormal or
resisted.
– Rumination.
– Pseudohallucination.
– Hallucination.
– Thought insertion.
– Delusion (strictly, a delusional perception). This
belief is fixed, was arrived at illogically, and is not
amenable to reason. The patient experienced a
normal perception but interpreted it with delusional
meaning, termed a ‘delusional perception’. This is a
first rank symptom of schizophrenia.

– Phaeochromocytoma. Although, because of its
rarity, this remains an unlikely diagnosis for the
scenario, it is the most likely from the options
given. The features suggestive of
phaeochromocytoma are the family history (not
always present), hypertension, hyperglycaemia
and intermittent episodes of increased
catecholamine release. The history alone is not
diagnostic: urinary or serum catecholamine assays
and imaging of the adrenals would be required.
– Hyperthyroidism. This lady already suffers from
one autoimmune disorder (vitiligo) which
increases her risk of another (Grave’s disease).
Tremor, heat intolerance, anxiety and increased
appetite are classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
– Fluoxetine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
can initially be alerting and agitating, particularly
in young people. This can increase the risk of
suicide in the severely depressed. Use of an
alternative antidepressant should be considered.
– Caffeine. Caffeine has anxiogenic effects.
Many soft drinks contain large amounts of
caffeine.
– Amfetamine. This drug increases concentrations
of dopamine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine),
leading to increased sympathetic nervous system
activation. Cocaine intoxication would give a
similar presentation.

– Obsessive-compulsive disorder. This woman has a
greater than 2-week history of both obsessions
and compulsions associated with functional
impairment.
– No mental illness. This woman is not experiencing
obsessions or compulsions. She is responding to
external influences and her handwashing may
realistically reduce the feared outcome of
infection transmission.
– Depressive disorder. This woman has the three
core symptoms of depression and two further
symptoms. Her obsessions and compulsions are
concurrent with her depression so the primary
diagnosis is of a depressive disorder rather than
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
– Phobia. This woman has situation-specific anxiety
with avoidance and panic attacks. She does not
have obsessional thoughts, rather her anxiety is
brought on by external stimuli. Although she
washes her hands to reduce her anxiety, it is not a
purposeless or excessive action, meaning it is not a
compulsion. She is not hypochondriacal as she
does not believe she is ill.

– This lady appears to be suffering from
psychogenic, non-epileptic seizures. This is
suggested by the chronological association with a
significant stressor (being told that she will be left
alone when her husband starts work). These are
often more common in those with a family or
personal history of epilepsy.
– This is a classic presentation of a dissociative
fugue, or ‘fugue state’. The man is unable to
recount any personal details, and appears to have
travelled from a distant city. Note the possible
severe stressor of being involved with a company
that has recently been bankrupted.
– Ganser’s syndrome is an incredibly rare disorder,
characterized by near-miss answers (implying that
the patient has understood the question). It is
often accompanied by florid hallucinations and
conversion symptoms. It was initially studied in
prison inmates, and was previously considered a
factitious disorder.
– Dissociation secondary to psychoactive substance
use. Given the history of onset, and the fact that she
was at a party the previous evening, initial
consideration should be given to substance-induced
dissociation. Common substances associated with

this include ketamine and tranquillizers; however, it
can also occur following ingestion of less common
substances such as mescalin or peyote.

– Bereavement reaction – note the chronological
proximity to his death, and that the psychotic
content features her husband.
– Musculoskeletal injury. Note the distribution of
injuries, and given the fact he was a driver (in the UK,
the driver’s seatbelt crosses the right shoulder) this is
likely to be a whiplash/seatbelt-related injury. There
is no suggestion of psychogenic origin in this case.
– PTSD is the likely diagnosis in this case. Note the
hyperarousal, avoidance and nightmares. Also
note the persistent duration of the symptoms.
– These symptoms are fairly typical of temporal
lobe epilepsy. Note the history of likely head
injury (implied by the fact she was referred
from the neurosurgical unit). She should be
referred for EEG.

– Subjective cognitive impairment. This woman
presents with concerns about her memory but has a
normal score on standardized cognitive assessment.
This may reflect her high educational level. It would
be important to clarify how old her mother was
when she was diagnosed with dementia, to guide
frequency of follow-up (above 65 suggests the
teacher has a 3-fold increased risk, under 65
suggests the possibility of a stronger genetic risk).
– Mild cognitive impairment. This woman has a
below normal score on standardized cognitive
assessment but no impairment in activities of daily
living. This low score is quite concerning in view of
her young age and high educational attainment
and she should be referred to a young onset
memory clinic for comprehensive investigation.
– Dementia (early onset). This woman has a below
normal score on standardized cognitive
assessment and impairment in activities of daily
living. She should be referred to a young onset

memory clinic for comprehensive investigation. In
view of her family history, genetic testing and
counselling of any children may be considered.
– Depression. This woman has symptoms of a
depressive episode of moderate severity. This is
likely to account for her cognitive symptoms and
loss of one mark on the MMSE.

– Subdural haematoma. This woman has atrial
fibrillation and so is likely to be on warfarin. There
should therefore be a low threshold for suspecting
an intracranial bleed after minor or no injury.
A chronic subdural haematoma as opposed to
neurodegenerative cause of dementia is
suggested by her relatively quick cognitive
deterioration, possible fluctuating consciousness
level (uncharacteristic afternoon naps),
neurological signs and history of head injury. It is
not uncommon for there to be a latent period of
days to weeks between injury and symptoms. The
next step should be brain imaging.
– Normal pressure hydrocephalus. This is suggested
by this man’s incontinence, ataxia and cognitive
impairment, the classic triad of ‘wet, wobbly,
wacky’. Often this disorder is idiopathic. The next
step should be brain imaging.
– Addison’s disease. This often presents insidiously
with fatigue, loss of stamina, weight loss, apathy
and memory problems. Postural hypotension is
common and is suggested by her dizziness on rising.
Hyperpigmentation of the palmar creases and
buccal mucosa is often present but easy to miss.
Addison’s disease is rare, so this woman is most
likely to be suffering from depression, but it would
be important to check U&Es (hyponatraemia,
hyperkalaemia) and glucose (hypoglycaemia) and
consider a short synacthen test (diagnostic test).
– Cushing’s syndrome. This is suggested by the
central obesity, amenorrhoea, hypertension,
plethoric face and characteristic psychiatric
symptoms of low mood and forgetfulness.
Glucose is likely to be elevated. The next step
would be to refer for a dexamethasone
suppression test to confirm the diagnosis.
– Hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism
causes hypercalcaemia. Mild hypercalcaemia
(<3.0 mmol/L) is common in older women and
often asymptomatic. Symptoms when present
include low mood, abdominal pain, bone pain
and renal calculi. Mild memory problems
often occur, progressing to a delirium if
calcium levels are very high (>3.8 mmol/L).
The next step should be to check serum calcium
and phosphate.

period of time, there is a very real risk that he may
not know how to care for himself, which could be
the reason for his rapid weight loss on discharge. It
would be important to exclude depression,
alcohol or drug misuse, or residual psychotic
symptoms as cause for his weight loss.
– Even though he has told you that he is fine, it is
likely that he is suffering from bulimia nervosa.
Both hypokalaemia and swollen parotid glands
can be caused by excessive vomiting. The
hypokalaemia is probably responsible for the
U waves on the ECG.
– This girl describes classical obsessive-compulsive
symptoms: obsession (fear of infection);
compulsion (having to prepare food in a specific
manner), with awareness that it is irrational, but
severe anxiety if the compulsion is not used to
‘cancel out’ the obsession.
– Despite this lady’s past history of anorexia nervosa,
her current presentation is not majorly suggestive
of relapse. She appears to have developed a specific
phobia (with panic attacks) of vomiting, which has
probably resulted from her recent physical illness
(norovirus, the ‘winter vomiting bug’). The link
between the two could be understood as an
example of psychological ‘conditioning’.
– The cause of weight loss in this case does not
suggest any concern with body shape. Instead, this
man appears not to be eating food because of a
delusional belief that the food would be poisoned.
He is suffering from an acute paranoid psychosis.

– Admission to psychiatric hospital. This man is at high
risk of suicide because of his age, sex, violent method
of planned suicide, final acts and mental disorder.
The extremely high suicidal intent indicated by the
circumstances of his presentation means hospital
admission is the only safe management option.
– Refer to psychiatric out-patients routinely. A
psychiatric referral is advisable given his treatmentresistant depression. There is no suggestion of
acute risk to necessitate an urgent referral.
– Refer to crisis team. Even without evidence of risk
to self or others, psychotic features are suggestive
of a very severe depression that could worsen
rapidly.

– Mirtazapine. SSRIs increase risk of bleeding when
co-prescribed with nonsteroidals and
anticoagulants. Mirtazapine is suggested as an
alternative first line antidepressant by NICE (2009).
– SSRI. NICE (2009) recommends SSRIs as first line
antidepressants if there are no cautions.
– SSRI. NICE (2009) recommends SSRIs as first line
antidepressants. Sleep disturbance often resolves
as depression improves. A more sedating
antidepressant such as mirtazapine would be a
good second line option.
– Mirtazapine. Although first line, SSRIs often cause
sexual dysfunction. If avoidance of this side-effect
is very important to patients, an alternative such as
mirtazapine can be considered.
– Duloxetine. Duloxetine is licensed for both stress
incontinence and depression. It is a joint serotonin
and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake
inhibitor. This action in the spinal cord leads to
increased tone in the urethral sphincter.

depression with poor oral intake. This is not
manageable in the community. He needs an
urgent physical exam and bloods. If his renal
function is acutely impaired he may need transfer
to a general hospital for intravenous fluids. If
this man is in a general hospital at the time of
mental health assessment he should be physically
assessed prior to transfer.

man is to consider a higher intensity psychological
intervention or an antidepressant.

– Haloperidol. Although haloperidol is not first line for
schizophrenia, patient preference is important in the
choice of antipsychotic. She should have an ECG
before recommencing as haloperidol can prolong
the QTc.
– Aripiprazole. This is the antipsychotic least likely to
be associated with weight gain and the metabolic
syndrome. First generation antipsychotics would
be the next best choice.
– Quetiapine. From the options given, haloperidol
and chlorpromazine are most likely to be
associated with extrapyramidal side-effects.
Aripiprazole is less associated with extrapyramidal
side-effects, but quetiapine has an even lower
likelihood. Flupentixol is a depot medication and
the majority of patients prefer oral. Clozapine is not
indicated as the patient is not treatment-resistant.
– Flupentixol depot formulation. Long-acting
intramuscular injections (depot formulations)

– Hypersalivation. This is most commonly seen with

– Postural hypotension. This is a side-effect of most
antipsychotics, secondary to adrenergic receptor
blockade.
– Hyperprolactinaemia, causing galactorrhoea. This
is a side-effect of most but not all antipsychotics,
secondary to D2 receptor blockade in the
tuberoinfundibular pathway.
– Agranulocytosis. Without monitoring, this is seen
in just under 1% of patients taking clozapine.
– Akathisia. This is frequent purposeless movement
associated with a subjective inner restlessness. It is very
unpleasant for patients, and a risk factor for suicide. It is
a side-effect of most antipsychotics and some other
psychotropics also. High doses are a risk factor.

– Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
therapy. This or trauma-focused CBT are
recommended for moderate to severe posttraumatic stress disorder even if the trauma
occurred less than 4 weeks ago.
– Watchful waiting. This is recommended for
symptoms of mild post-traumatic stress disorder
within 4 weeks of the trauma.
– Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
therapy. This or trauma-focused CBT are
recommended for all severities of post-traumatic
stress disorder where the trauma occurred more

recommended as first line medications for
post-traumatic stress disorder. Mirtazapine is less
likely to be associated with sexual dysfunction than
a SSRI. Paroxetine is the only SSRI licensed for
post-traumatic stress disorder, although it is likely
to be a class effect.

– This man has likely overdosed on intravenous
opiates, leading to respiratory depression and a
reduced consciousness level. Naloxone is an opioid
antagonist, and needs to be given to reverse
toxicity. Naltrexone is also an opiate antagonist but
it needs to be given orally so is not suitable for
someone with a reduced GCS (risk of aspiration).
– Lofexidine can be helpful in reducing the
unpleasant symptoms of opiate withdrawal. It
would not be advisable to prescribe
benzodiazepines to someone who already has a
substance dependence.
– While methadone, buprenorphine and
dihydrocodeine are used as ‘substitution therapy’,
this lady’s heavy use of heroin means that she is
likely to have severe withdrawal symptoms. As a
partial opioid agonist, buprenorphine is likely to
precipitate a withdrawal state given the
magnitude of her usage. There is some evidence
to suggest that dihydrocodeine can be as effective
as methadone; however, its use is not widespread
as – being in tablet form – it is easier to divert onto
the black market.
– This man could benefit from loperamide.
– Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that
can be used to reduce the euphoric effects of
opiates. Naloxone would also have this effect but
it needs to be given parenterally and is shortacting, so naltrexone is preferred.

moderate to severe generalized anxiety disorder.

metabolized in the liver, and that impaired liver
function can delay metabolism and excretion,
drugs with long half-lives can accumulate and

increase the risk of toxicity. From the three
benzodiazepines listed, lorazepam has the
shortest half-life, and is therefore safest to use for
detoxification in this case.
– Thiamine. From the history given, this lady is not
intoxicated. She appears to be suffering from the
triad of symptoms associated with Wernicke’s
encephalopathy, and needs urgent treatment
with parenteral thiamine.
– Cognitive-behavioural therapy, focusing on
identifying cues and preventing relapse, could be
very helpful for this lady. Motivational
interviewing, with a focus on ‘promoting change’,
may not be so useful as she is already abstinent.
Psychoeducation tends to happen in groups, and
because she is not keen on this there is a risk of
early disengagement.
– Acamprosate may be helpful in reducing cravings.
Naltrexone is also thought to reduce cravings, but
would be likely to reduce the efficacy of the
tramadol.
– Alcoholics Anonymous is a 12-step programme
that could be useful for this man. It is not run by
health services, and tends to consist of self-funded
groups. Their ethos is one of complete abstinence,
and their system of peer support (or ‘sponsorship’)
can be very beneficial for some.

– Patients with dependent personality disorder can
quickly become institutionalized, and alternatives
to admission should be preferred. In this case, the
lady should be empathically reassured, and
encouraged to engage with her existing care plan.
– While some practitioners would argue that this
patient does not have a mental illness, she is
clearly distressed and – in the short term – at
incredibly high risk of completing suicide or
otherwise harming herself. It would also appear
that there is no safe place to which she could be
discharged. A short ‘crisis’ admission to a
psychiatric ward, of agreed duration and with
clear goals and boundaries, would allow for her
distress and short-term risk to be managed, and
longer term support organized. Discharging her to
police custody is not appropriate.
– It may be worth offering this gentleman a trial
of antipsychotic medication. While
psychotherapeutic measures would be more likely
to be effective in the long term, he appears to be
untrusting of services, and it would be unlikely
that he would engage with this. A small dose of an
antipsychotic may be enough to reduce his
paranoia to the extent that he may engage with a
psychotherapist, and may also provide a reason

for ongoing contact with doctors such that trust
and rapport can be established.
– Depression arising in patients with personality
disorders can be amenable to drug treatment;
however, the benefits of this need to be balanced
with the risk of overdosing on potentially harmful
drugs. Antidepressants dispensed on a weekly/
twice-weekly/three times weekly/daily basis can,
to some degree, modify this risk.
– This gentleman could benefit from lifestyle advice.
His situation has recently changed, which may
explain his increased anxiety. However, it is likely
that his caffeine consumption is contributing to his
insomnia, and that smoking cigarettes all night is
perpetuating the problem. Advice regarding
caffeine, nicotine, diet and exercise should be
given in the first instance.

– It would appear that this lady has developed a
comorbid depressive illness. Her eating appears to
have been improving. Therapeutic priority should
be given to managing her depressive symptoms and
her high risk of completing suicide. From the options
listed, the most appropriate would be an informal
admission to a general psychiatric ward. Outpatient or home treatment may be considered;
however, given the levels of risk involved, admission
to hospital would probably be more appropriate.
– There is some evidence to suggest that brain
serotonin function is abnormal in patients with
bulimia nervosa. There is also evidence to suggest
that antidepressants (specifically high-dose
fluoxetine) can be very useful in treating binge/
purge behaviours. In this case, prescribing
fluoxetine would be appropriate.
– This girl is incredibly unwell, and her current
physical condition poses a threat to her life. By
virtue of her mental illness, and probably also her
state of malnutrition, she clearly lacks capacity to
make decisions regarding her healthcare.
Immediate hospital treatment is required, and she
should be transferred urgently under mental
health legislation. Also, given her persistent
refusal to eat, and her lack of capacity and insight,
it is likely that involuntary nasogastric feeding will
be required to save her life. This is both a clinically
and medico-legally difficult situation, and should

– Interpersonal therapy, or IPT, is a type of
psychotherapy that aims to change the person’s
interpersonal behaviour by fostering adaptation
to current interpersonal roles and situations. The
four areas of focus are grief, role dispute, role
transition and interpersonal deficits. This lady has
clearly stated that she wishes to address her

problems with grief (the death of her mother), role
transition (and possibly role dispute) (starting
work at her new firm), and interpersonal deficits
(standing up to dominant male partners). In doing
this, issues which have predisposed, precipitated,
and perpetuated her illness can be addressed.
– This boy lives in a family in which both parents are
high-achievers, and subsequently feels pressured to
live up to their expectations. Family therapy would
be likely to be incredibly useful in this case, assuming
that all parties involved are willing to engage.

– This lady may benefit from maternal skills
teaching. The health visitor can be an invaluable
resource for providing this.
– This lady appears to be suffering from the ‘baby
blues’. Simple reassurance should be given. This
will likely pass after 10 days or so, but follow-up is
important to ensure that she is not developing
postnatal depression.
– This lady appears to be developing a puerperal
psychosis. Given her symptoms, the use of an
antipsychotic medication is indicated. Olanzapine
is widely used for puerperal psychosis. ECT may be
required if she does not respond to
pharmacological treatment.
– This lady is likely to have a severe postnatal
depressive illness. Given her presentation and her
poor oral intake, her illness should be considered
to be potentially life-threatening.
Electroconvulsive therapy should be considered.
– This lady is tearful and low in mood. It is not clear
whether she meets criteria for diagnosis of a
depressive illness; however, she appears to be
incredibly troubled by not meeting her (fairly high)
personal expectations regarding pure breast feeding.
Cognitive-behavioural therapy would allow her
to explore this with the aim of allowing her to view
the situation from a more balanced perspective.

– Sodium valproate is strongly associated with the
development of neural tube defects. It is preferable
not to prescribe sodium valproate to women of
childbearing age, and less teratogenic alternatives
should be considered. If it is considered necessary, risk
counselling and reliable contraception are necessary.
– Olanzapine is associated with an increased risk of
gestational diabetes. It should be prescribed with
caution in all pregnant women, and alternatives
should be used in women who are already at
increased risk of gestational diabetes (e.g. obesity,
gestational diabetes during previous pregnancy,
strong family history of diabetes). In any case, blood

and/or urinary glucose should be regularly
monitored.
– The use of paroxetine during pregnancy (particularly
during the first trimester) has been associated with
an increased risk in heart defects (particularly atrial
and ventricular septal defects). Use in later
pregnancy has been associated with neonatal
pulmonary hypertension. Lithium has also been
associated with heart defects; however, there is no
strong association with pulmonary hypertension in
the neonate. It should also be noted that it may be
safer to prescribe an alternative antidepressant to
paroxetine (if required) during pregnancy.
However, swapping to a different medication is
associated with a risk of relapse.
– The use of lithium during pregnancy has been
associated with an increased risk of fetal heart
defects, specifically Ebstein’s anomaly
(displacement of the opening of the tricuspid valve).
The absolute risk may be as low as 0.1%, but this is
still 20 times greater than the general population.
This risk needs to be balanced against the risk of
relapse of illness associated with discontinuation of
lithium, as untreated affective/psychotic illness can
place the fetus at greatly increased risk.
– Fluoxetine is one of the better studied
antidepressants in pregnancy. Some studies have
suggested that in utero exposure to fluoxetine can
cause pulmonary hypertension and low birth
weight in the neonate. As with all drugs taken
during pregnancy, risk vs benefit needs to be
considered on an individual basis.

– Donepezil. This woman has mild to moderate
dementia for which cholinesterase inhibitors are
recommended. Donepezil is first line.
– Memantine. This woman has severe dementia
(MMSE <10) for which memantine is
recommended.
– Memantine. This woman has mild to moderate
dementia for which cholinesterase inhibitors are
recommended. However, she has a number of
relative contraindications to cholinesterase inhbitor
use – their cholinergic effects can induce
bradycardia, which may be particularly problematic
in those with conduction deficits. Similarly
cholinergic drugs can cause bronchoconstriction,
which may be problematic in COPD and asthma,
and increase gastric acid secretions, which could
worsen peptic ulceration. Overall, it would probably
be better to try memantine first for this woman.
– Rivastigmine. This is the cholinesterase
inhibitor with the best evidence for maintaining
cognition in Parkinson’s disease with dementia,
although it is likely a class effect.

– Diazepam. Abruptly discontinuing benzodiazepines
can result in withdrawal symptoms. These can have
onset within a day of stopping a short-acting
benzodiazepine (e.g. lorazepam) or up to 3 weeks
for a longer acting drug (e.g. diazepam). Symptoms
include insomnia, anxiety, anorexia, tremor,
perspiration, tinnitus and perceptual disturbances –
such as this woman’s visual illusion.
– Fluoxetine. All antidepressants, but particualrly
SSRIs, can be associated with the syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone,
leading to hyponatraemia. This is particularly likely
in older adults.
– Lithium. Lithium can induce nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus, leading to hypernatraemia if fluid intake
cannot be maintained, e.g. due to diarrhoea and
vomiting. Dehydration increases the risk of lithium
toxicity (which is renally excreted) so a random
lithium level should also be urgently checked for
this man.
– Haloperidol. This man is likely to have received
haloperidol to manage his delirium. Haloperidol
can cause prolongation of the QT interval. In
extreme cases this can lead to torsade de pointes.
Olanzapine is less likely to have this side-effect.
– Amitriptyline. Anticholinergic medication is a big
risk factor for delirium. Amitriptyline is often
prescribed for neuropathic pain.

– Fluoxetine has the best evidence for the treatment
of depression in children and adolescents. It
should be noted that it is only recommended in the
treatment of moderate to severe depression. At
the time of going to press, fluoxetine does not
have a marketing licence in the UK, and use in
under 18s should be considered to be ‘off label’.
– While dexamfetamine and atomoxetine are also
indicated for the pharmacological management
of ADHD, methylphenidate is recommended as a
first line treatment in cases where drugs are
indicated. Be aware that there are various
preparations of methylphenidate, each with its
own pharmacokinetic profile (Concerta XLW,
RitalinW, Equasym XLW), and therefore the drug
should be prescribed by brand name.
– Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. By virtue of
its anticholinergic effects, it has been shown to
be effective in the management of enuresis.

It should be used only when behavioural
modification strategies have been ineffective.
– Haloperidol is licensed for the treatment of tics,
and can be effective.
– Atomoxetine is a noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
reuptake inhibitor, that can be very effective
in the management of ADHD. It is not
recommended for use as a first line agent; however,
it does not appear to be associated with tics, and
may be a more appropriate agent for this girl.

– Given the degree of impairment to both him and his
family, this boy is likely to have an autistic spectrum
disorder. The absence of the delay of language
development is suggestive of Asperger’s syndrome
rather than childhood autism.
– This history is suggestive of secondary enuresis.
While it would be important to exclude physical
causes (urinary infection, epilepsy, diabetes),
there is a clear psychological stressor that seemed
to precede the problem. While not explicitly
stated in the case, it is suggested that she had
initially gained bladder control (‘. . . recently
started wetting’), which differentiates this from
primary enuresis.
– While many of the behaviours are suggestive of the
core symptoms of ADHD, note that they appear to
be limited to the academic setting (he appears fine
at home). ADHD is pervasive rather than
situational, and this case is suggestive that the boy
may be having difficulties with schoolwork (either
because it is too difficult or too easy).
– Oppositional defiant disorder is similar to conduct
disorder in that behaviour is negativistic, rebellious,
defiant and disruptive. However, unlike conduct
disorder, the behaviour associated with oppositional
defiant disorder does not violate the rights of others
and troubles with the law are less common.
– Heller’s syndrome – also known as childhood
disintegrative disorder – is characterized by
normal development until around the age of
2 years, followed by a loss of previously acquired
skills (language, social and adaptive skills, play,
bowel and bladder control and motor skills)
before age 10. It is also associated with an autismlike impairment of social interaction as well as
repetitive, stereotyped interests and mannerisms.
Thus, after the deterioration, these children may
resemble autistic children. It is more common in
boys, but can occur in girls (as opposed to Rett’s
syndrome, which occurs almost exclusively in
girls). It is different from Rett’s in that
development tends to be further advanced
prior to deterioration.

– This lady has a mild intellectual disability, and will
have an estimated IQ of 50–69. Individuals in this
group comprise the majority (85%) of all people
with intellectual disabilities.
– From the information given, this gentleman
manages to live alone without support. His
symptoms suggest that he suffers from a
pervasive developmental disorder, likely
Asperger’s syndrome (which is not an intellectual
disability). His interests would suggest that he
has above-average intelligence (IQ 100 >).
– This boy has a profound intellectual disability
(IQ < 20). He is unable to care for himself and fully
dependent on the support of others.
– This woman has a moderate intellectual disability
(IQ 35–49). Note that she is able to live on her
own, albeit in a supported housing complex with a
great deal of support.
– This gentleman has a severe intellectual disability
(IQ 20–34). He lives with his family, who are his
main carers, and is able to perform simple tasks
under supervision. His self-care skills are limited,
but he seems to be able to sometimes contribute
to these.

– Prader–Willi syndrome is characterized by low
muscle tone, short stature, incomplete sexual
development, cognitive disabilities, problem
behaviours and a chronic feeling of hunger that can
lead to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity.
– Behavioural disturbances in Lesch–Nyhan
syndrome emerge between 2 and 3 years of age.
Persistent self-injurious behaviour is a hallmark
of the syndrome.
– Rett’s syndrome. Apparently normal or nearnormal early development is followed by partial or
complete loss of acquired cognitive and motor
skills. Stereotyped tortuous wringing of the hands
is a distinctive feature.
– Turner’s syndrome occurs exclusively in girls. It is
very occasionally associated with mild intellectual
disability, with specific deficits in visuospatial tasks,
visual memory and arithmetic, although most
patients have normal IQ. Physical features usually
include gonadal failure, which results in primary
amenorrhoea and failure to develop secondary
sexual characteristics.
– Cri-du-chat syndrome is so called due to the
distinctive kitten-like crying sounds that these
individuals often make (due to problems with the
larynx and nervous system). About 30% lose the
cry by the age of 2.

– This man has morbid jealousy. He is convinced
that his partner is being unfaithful, despite
extensive reassurances and evidence to the
contrary. The name ‘Othello syndrome’ is derived
from the play Othello by William Shakespeare, in
which the protagonist murders his wife
(Desdemona – which means ‘the unfortunate’ in
Greek). Othello syndrome is associated with
alcohol misuse and violence. Treatment includes
antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy;
however, given the very poor prognosis, it is often
said that the most effective treatment is
‘geographical’ (i.e. relocation of the spouse to a
distant area).
– The symptoms present in this man (delusions,
hallucinations) are suggestive of a paranoid
psychotic state. Given his age, the implied rapid
onset of symptoms and the fact that he has no
psychiatric history, this is unlikely to be a first
presentation of paranoid schizophrenia. The fact
that he has been at a music festival should be a
pointer that substances may be implicated in his
presentation. His symptoms are not typical of an
alcohol withdrawal delirium; however, this is an
important differential.
– This lady is likely to be suffering from a manic
illness. She has grandiose delusions (that she is a
pop star). Note that she has recently been
hospitalized with a depressive illness: her mania
may be associated with drug treatment or may
signify the presence of a bipolar illness. Crimes
related to mania include financial offences and
occasionally aggression.
– The nature of this crime (killing a man in
retribution for a mistake in making a sandwich) is
alarming. The fact this man has an extensive
forensic history, is actively involved with
organized crime and appears cold and
emotionless in the face of a crime of such
magnitude is strongly suggestive of antisocial
personality disorder. It could be that the man also
meets ICD-10 criteria for dissocial personality
disorder, and may also score highly on the PCL-R
(the ‘gold standard’ for assessing psychopathy).
Further assessment would be required to confirm
this diagnosis.
– There is an association between fire-setting and
mild intellectual disability. This should be
differentiated from arson (deliberate fire-raising
for secondary gain, e.g. insurance money),
pyromania (compulsion to set fires, followed by a
‘release of tension’), wilful destruction of property
(e.g. in antisocial personality disorder), or firesetting driven by other mental disorders.

Glossary
Affect Affect refers to the transient ebb and flow of
emotion in response to particular stimuli, e.g. smiling at a joke or crying at a sad memory. It is assessed
by observing the patient’s posture, facial expression,
emotional reactivity and speech. The two components that should be assessed are the appropriateness
of the affect and its range. See pages 6 and 50.
Anxiety Anxiety is a mood state. It can be defined as a
response to an unknown, internal or vague threat.
This is distinct from fear, which is defined below.
The experience of anxiety consists of both apprehensive or nervous thoughts and the awareness of a
physical reaction to anxiety. See page 77.
Attempted suicide An episode of deliberate self-harm,
which did not end in death but was driven by suicidal intent. This is in contrast with episodes of
non-fatal deliberate self-harm driven by other motivations. See page 45.
Capacity Capacity is the ability of an individual to
make their own decisions. See page 38.
Circumstantiality Circumstantiality describes overinclusive speech that is delayed in reaching its final
goal. This is because of excessive detail and diversion.
However, the final goal will be reached, which distinguishes it from flight of ideas. Circumstantiality can be
found in the normal population but is increased in
anxiety disorders and hypomania. See page 59 and 70.
Compulsions Compulsions can be defined as repetitive mental operations (such as counting) or physical
acts (such as checking) that a patient feels compelled
to perform in response to their own obsessions. The
motivation for compulsions is the reduction of anxiety generated by an obsession. The compulsion may
be either unrelated to the preceding obsession (e.g.
counting) or an unnecessarily excessive response to
the obsession (e.g. handwashing). See page 86.
Delusion A delusion is the most severe form of an abnormal idea. It is a fixed belief arrived at illogically
and is not amenable to reason. It is not accepted
in the patient’s cultural background. The presence
of a delusion signifies a psychotic disorder. See
page 67.
Delusional perception Experiencing a normal perception but interpreting it with delusional meaning. For
example, ‘I heard the clock chime and I knew that
meant the aliens were planning to kill me’. This is
a first rank symptom of schizophrenia. See page 68.

Depersonalization Depersonalization is feeling yourself to be strange or unreal.
Derealization Derealization is feeling that external reality is strange or unreal.
Depression A depressed mood is when a patient describes feeling depressed, sad, dejected, despondent
or low. A depressive disorder is a specific psychiatric
condition where the mood change is sufficiently severe, chronic and occurring with other symptoms.
Dissociation Dissociation is an altered state of consciousness in which normally integrated experiences
or processes are disrupted. For example, walking to
work on ‘autopilot’ and not noticing a new shop
front – the sensory information has not been integrated with the conscious experience. Depersonalization or derealization are dissociative symptoms (see
above). Extreme dissociative states can be associated
with disorders including non-epileptic convulsions
and fugue. See page 93.
Dysphasia Dysphasia is an impairment of language
abilities despite intact sensory and motor function.
See page 105.
Dyspraxia Dyspraxia is an impairment of the ability to
carry out skilled motor movements despite intact
motor function. See page 105.
Dysgnosia Dysgnosia is an impairment in the ability to
interpret sensory information despite intact sensory
organ function. See page 105.
Echolalia Echolalia is when a patient senselessly repeats words or phrases that have been spoken near
them. It can be viewed as a form of disorganized
thinking or as an abnormality of speech. It occurs
in a range of psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenic catatonia, autism and brain injury.
Fear Fear, similar to anxiety, is an alerting signal in response to a potential threat. It differs from anxiety in
that it is a response to a known, external or definite
object. Anxiety and fear are discussed on page 77.
First rank symptoms First rank symptoms were described by Schneider who suggested that the presence
of one or more first rank symptoms, in the absence of
organic disease, was sufficient to diagnose schizophrenia. These symptoms still feature strongly in
modern diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. See
page 72.
Flight of ideas Flight of ideas can be described as either
a disorder of thought form or an abnormality of

285

Glossary
speech. It describes thinking that is markedly accelerated and results in a stream of loosely connected concepts. The link between concepts can be normal,
tenuous or through puns and clanging. It differs from
circumstantiality in that the links between concepts
are more tenuous and the final goal is less likely to
be reached. In its extreme form, speech can become
unintelligible or approach the incoherent thought
disorder of schizophrenia. See page 59 and 70.
Functional symptoms Functional symptoms are physical symptoms without identifiable structural cause.
See page 97.
Hallucination Hallucinations are perceptions that occur in the absence of external stimuli and are indistinguishable from normal sensation. See page 66.
Illusion Illusions are misperceptions of real external
stimuli. For example, spots on the carpet are perceived
as insects. Illusions can occur in healthy people particularly when tired, not concentrating, experiencing
strong emotions or intoxicated with substances.
Insight Insight describes a patient’s understanding of
the nature and degree of his or her mental illness
and the recognition of the need for treatment. An assessment of insight is an integral part of the mental
state examination. See page 7.
Mood Mood is sustained emotion over a period of
time. This differs from a ‘feeling’, which is a shortlived experience, and ‘affect’, which is the external expression of transient emotion.
Neologism Neologism is an example of disorganized
thinking. It is a new word created by the patient, often combining syllables rather than words. It is classically associated with schizophrenia and can also
occur in organic brain disorder.
Obsession An obsession is an involuntary thought, image or impulse, which is recurrent, intrusive, unpleasant and enters the mind against conscious
resistance. Patients recognize that the thoughts are

286

a product of their own mind even though they are involuntary and repugnant. See page 85.
Over-valued idea An over-valued idea is an incorrect
belief that is not impossible (in contrast to some
schizophrenic delusions), is held with marked emotional investment but not with unshakable conviction. See page 68.
Perseveration Perseveration is when a patient inappropriately repeats an initially correct action. For example, unnecessarily repeating a word or phrase, or
applying the rules of one task to a second task.
Pseudohallucinations Pseudohallucinations are perceptions that occur in the absence of external stimuli
but are experienced in the internal world rather than
the external world. For example, hearing a voice ‘inside my head’. See page 66.
Psychosis Psychosis is the presence of hallucinations,
delusions or thought disorder.
Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is an umbrella term for
psychological or talking therapy. There is a large
number of psychological therapies; the most common ones include supportive therapy, cognitivebehavioural therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, family therapy and group therapy.
Psychotropic medication Psychotropic medication
influences cognition, mood or behaviour. All
medications used to treat psychiatric disorders are
psychotropic.
Rumination Repeatedly thinking about the causes and
experience of previous distress and difficulties. Voluntary thinking which is not resisted.
Self-harm Self-harm is a blanket term used to mean
any intentional act done in the knowledge that it
was potentially harmful. It can take the form of
self-poisoning (overdosing) or self-injury (cutting,
slashing, burning, etc.). See page 45.
Suicide Suicide is the act of intentionally ending one’s
own life.

Chairman’s Note

I

t is a pleasure to present the new edition of The Washington Manual®
Subspecialty Consult Series: Nephrology Subspecialty Consult. This pocketsize book continues to be a primary reference for medical students,
interns, residents, and other practitioners who need ready access to
practical clinical information to diagnose and treat patients with a wide
variety of disorders. Medical knowledge continues to increase at an
astounding rate, which creates a challenge for physicians to keep up with
the biomedical discoveries, genetic and genomic information, and novel
therapeutics that can positively impact patient outcomes. The Washington
Manual Subspecialty Series addresses this challenge by concisely and
practically providing current scienti c information for clinicians to aid
them in the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of common medical
conditions.
I want to personally thank the authors, which include house o cers,
fellows, and attendings at Washington University School of Medicine and
Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Their commitment to patient care and education
is unsurpassed, and their e orts and skill in compiling this manual are
evident in the quality of the nal product. In particular, I would like to
acknowledge our editors, Drs. Steven Cheng and Anitha Vijayan, and the
series editors, Drs. Katherine Henderson and Tom De Fer, who have
worked tirelessly to produce another outstanding edition of this manual. I
would also like to thank Dr. Melvin Blanchard, Chief of the Division of
Medical Education in the Department of Medicine at Washington
University School of Medicine, for his advice and guidance. I believe this
Subspecialty Manual will meet its desired goal of providing practical
knowledge that can be directly applied at the bedside and in outpatient
settings to improve patient care.

Preface

T

he rst and second editions of The Washington Manual Nephrology
Subspecialty Consult achieved the goal of the “subspecialty” series because
they were well written, well organized, and served as an e cient bedside
resource for residents and students. The hope of this and future editions is
to build on that success by updating content with new developments
while maintaining the original high standards.
The eld of nephrology is changing rapidly, as new advances change
the management of acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease,
and renal transplantation. AKI continues to be a life-threatening problem
for the hospitalized patient, and new clinical trials have addressed the
role of intensive renal replacement therapy in AKI. Glomerulonephritides
generate signi cant challenges to the nephrologist as we strive to treat
the patient e ectively but at the same time try to minimize side e ects
from the treatment regimen. Newer agents have been added as induction
therapies to decrease rejection rates after renal transplantation. Early
initiation of hemodialysis has recently been proven to be not beneficial in
patients with chronic kidney disease.
The eld of nephrology remains a fascinating, challenging, and
exciting area of internal medicine. Electrolyte and acid–base problems
will always pose an interesting and thought-provoking dilemma to the
trainee and the attending alike. The thrill of working up a patient with
hyponatremia or narrowing down the di erential diagnoses to get to the
underlying etiology of hypokalemia never changes with time, and we
hope to transfer our passion of nephrology to medical students and
residents and inspire them to pursue a career in nephrology.
We would like to acknowledge and thank the authors for all the time
and e ort vested in this publication. We also would like to extend our
gratitude to Katherine Henderson, MD, who gave us invaluable guidance
and feedback. We hope the readers will nd this publication to be a
relevant, informative, and useful tool in their day-to-day clinical practice.
14

Last, but not least, we would like to thank our families—Vichu, Maya,
Dev, and our parents for their love and support.

Art and Science of Urinalysis
Biju Marath and Steven Cheng

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Urinalysis is the physical, chemical, and microscopic examination of
urine, and is a key aspect in the evaluation of renal and urinary tract
disease.

DIAGNOSIS
When used properly, the urinalysis can offer innumerable insights into a
broad variety of diagnoses. Proper examination of the urine consists
of two parts: (a) the urine dipstick test and (b) the sediment
evaluation by light microscopy. The presence or absence of features on
urinalysis can be useful in narrowing diagnostic possibilities.1–5
The urine dipstick test gives insight into the physical and chemical
parameters of the urine. These properties can be invaluable in the
assessment of infections, inflammation, glucose control, acid–base
balance, hematuria, proteinuria, and intravascular volume status, to
name but a few conditions.
Microscopic analysis allows for sediment evaluation. Since the
characteristics of urinary sediment vary depending on the site of injury,
this assessment is helpful in localizing the injury in renal parenchymal
disease.
Specimen Collection
Urine should ideally be examined immediately or no longer than 2
hours after collection.
20

Prolonged standing causes urine to become progressively more alkaline
(urea is broken down, generating ammonia). The higher pH dissolves
casts and promotes cell lysis.
If delay is inevitable, urine can be preserved for up to 6 hours if
refrigerated at +2 to +8°C. Refrigeration may result in precipitation of
phosphates or crystals.
Preservatives such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, “cellFIX,” and tubes
containing lyophilized borate-formate sorbitol powder have been used to
maintain the formed elements of the urine samples.
The method for preparing a urine sample is given in Table 1-1.
Physical Properties
Visual inspection and notation of other general physical characteristics of
a urine sample can yield important diagnostic information. The main
physical properties to be determined include color, clarity, odor, and
specific gravity.

Color
Normal urine is pale to yellow in color. Dilute urine appears lighter
and concentrated urine attains a darker yellow to amber shade.
21

Red urine may be noted with hematuria.
Positive dipstick test result for blood without evidence of red blood cells
(RBCs) on microscopy is a clue to the presence of free hemoglobin or
myoglobin in the urine, suggestive of conditions such as sickle-cell
anemia, ABO incompatible blood transfusion, or rhabdomyolysis.
Red urine can also result from the ingestion of large amounts of food
with red pigments (e.g., beets, rhubarb, blackberries), the presence of
excess urates, certain drugs (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin), and porphyria.
Green or blue urine can be seen with Pseudomonas urinary tract
infection (UTI), biliverdinuria, as well as exposure to amitriptyline, IV
cimetidine, IV promethazine, methylene blue, and triamterene.
Orange urine is typically seen with rifampin, phenothiazines and
phenazopyridine.
Urine that turns black on standing is classically described in
homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency (alkaptonuria).
Brown or black urine is also seen in conditions such as copper or
phenol poisoning, excessive L-dopa excretion, and with excess melanin
excretion in melanoma.
Clarity
Normal urine is typically clear.
Increased turbidity is most commonly noted with UTIs (pyuria).
Other causes include heavy hematuria, contamination from genital
secretions, presence of phosphate crystals in an alkaline urine, chyluria,
lipiduria, hyperoxaluria, and hyperuricosuria.
Odor
Normal urine typically does not have a strong odor.

22

Bacterial UTIs may be associated with a pungent odor.
Diabetic ketoacidosis can cause urine to have a fruity or sweet odor.
Other conditions associated with unusual odors include maple syrup urine
disease (maple syrup odor), phenylketonuria (musty odor),
gastrointestinal–​bladder fistulas (fecal odor), and cystine decomposition
(sulfuric odor).
Different medications (e.g., penicillin) and diet (e.g., asparagus coffee)
can also cause distinct odors.
Specific Gravity
Specific gravity is the most common method used to assess the relative
density of urine, although this is best determined by measuring
osmolality.
Though commonly used, ion exchange strips typically provide falsely low
results with urine pH values >6.5 and falsely high results with protein
levels of >7 g/L.
Values ≤1.010 indicate a dilute urine.
This generally suggests a state of relative hydration.
Very low specific gravity (≤1.005) may be indicative of diabetes
insipidus or water intoxication.
Values ≥1.020 indicate a more concentrated urine.
This generally suggests dehydration and volume contraction.
Very high specific gravity (≥1.032) may be suggestive of glucosuria, and
even higher values may indicate the presence of an extrinsic osmotic
agent such as contrast.
Chemical Properties

23

Urine pH
Urine pH can be measured very accurately and is quite reproducible.
Normal urine pH is in the range of 4.5 to 7.8.
Low urine pH can be observed in patients with large protein
consumption, metabolic acidosis, and volume depletion.
High urine pH may be seen in renal tubular acidosis (especially distal)
and in persons consuming vegetarian diets. Other causes include
prolonged storage of urine (allowing generation of ammonia from urea)
and infection with urea-splitting organisms (e.g., Proteus).
Hemoglobin
Presence of hemoglobin noted by the dipstick test may be indicative of
hematuria or point to other pathology such as intravascular hemolysis or
rhabdomyolysis. A discussion of hematuria and hemoglobinuria can be
found in Chapter 5.
Glucose
Urine glucose measurement is sensitive but not specific enough for
quantification by usual methods. Most laboratories give out a
semiquantitative readout (e.g., + for present to ++++ for present in
large amounts), but correlation with blood glucose levels is approximate
and varies with the concentration of the urine.
Glucose in the urine may be seen in diabetes, pancreatic and liver
disease, Cushing syndrome, and Fanconi syndrome.
In individuals with normal renal function, glucose is generally not
seen in the urine unless plasma levels exceed 180 to 200 mg/dL.
Glucosuria in the context of normal plasma glucose should raise suspicion
of a proximal tubule defect impairing glucose reabsorption.
False-negative results may be seen with the presence of ascorbic acid,
uric acid, and bacteria.
24

False-positive results can be observed in the presence of levodopa,
oxidizing detergents, and hydrochloric acid.
Protein
Proteinuria is an important marker of kidney disease and can be checked
using a dipstick test. Details of the methodology and more quantitative
methods are found in Chapter 4.
Leukocyte Esterase and Urine Nitrite
These two tests are often used together in the diagnosis of a UTI.
A positive leukocyte esterase (LE) is suggestive of granulocyte
activity in the urine.
Detection of LE is dependent on esterases released from lysed
granulocytes in urine reacting with the reagent strip.
Esterase produced from granulocyte lysis in long-standing urine or
contaminating vaginal cells may give false-positive results.
False-negative results occur when the esterase reaction with granulocytes
is inhibited, such as with hyperglycemia, albuminuria, tetracycline,
cephalosporins, and oxaluria.
A positive LE can be found independent of a UTI. Sterile pyuria is
commonly associated with nephrolithiasis, interstitial nephritis, and renal
tuberculosis.
The presence of nitrites in the urine depends on the ability of
bacteria to convert nitrate into nitrite, which then reacts with the
reagent test strip. This reaction is inhibited by ascorbic acid and high
specific gravity.
Low levels of urinary nitrate secondary to diet, degradation of nitrites
secondary to prolonged storage, and inadequate conversion of nitrates to
nitrites due to rapid transit in the bladder may contribute to falsenegative results despite the presence of urinary infection.
25

Certain bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus faecalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis) do not convert nitrate to nitrite.
Specificity for infection is best when both LE and nitrites are positive.
However, even if both tests are negative, infection cannot be completely
ruled out, and the clinical context must be considered.6
Ketones
Routine dipstick test detects only acetoacetic acid and not betahydroxybutyrate.
Ketones are mainly seen in diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis, but can
also be observed in pregnancy, carbohydrate-free diets, starvation,
vomiting, and strenuous exercise.
The presence of free sulfhydryl groups, levodopa metabolites, or highly
pigmented urine can give false-positive results.
Microscopic Exam
Urine microscopic examination of the sediment is a very important and
an underutilized tool to evaluate renal pathology.7,8 The urine sediment
can contain cells, casts, crystals, bacteria, fungi, and contaminants.
Cells
RBCs:
More than two RBCs per high-power field are abnormal and suggest
bleeding from some point in the genitourinary system.
RBCs are typically 4 to 7 μm in diameter and have a characteristic red
pigment with central opacity and smooth borders.
Dysmorphic RBCs are associated with glomerular disease and are best
seen on phase-contrast microscopy.
Swollen (ghost) cells or shrunken (crenated) cells are normal RBCs
26

that have been altered by osmolality of the urine. Crenated cells (5 μm in
diameter) have spiked borders and can be mistaken for small, granulated
cells. Ghost cells often require phase-contrast microscopy for viewing.
White blood cells:
White blood cells (WBCs) are characterized by their cytoplasmic
granulation.
They are distinguished from crenated RBCs by their lack of pigment and
their large size (10 to 12 μm in diameter). Brownian motion of the
granules in WBCs can be seen in phase-contrast microscopy.
WBCs in the urine are associated with infection and inflammation.
Eosinophils in urine, although thought of as a marker for allergic
interstitial nephritis, are now considered a nonsensitive and a nonspecific
marker. It can be seen in cholesterol embolism, glomerulonephritis,
prostatitis, chronic pyelonephritis, and urinary schistosomiasis.
Urine eosinophils are not easily identified unless special staining (Hansel
or Wright) is used.
Epithelial cells:
Four major epithelial cell groups must be distinguished:
Squamous epithelial cells: They are large, flat, with an irregular
cytoplasm of 30- to 50-μm diameter and a nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of
1:6. They are present in the urine because of shedding from the distal
genital tract and essentially are contaminants.
Transitional epithelial cells: They are 20 to 30 μm in diameter, are
pear or tadpole shaped, and have a nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio of 1:3.
They are usually seen intermittently with bladder catheterization or
irrigation. Occasionally, they may be associated with malignancy,
especially if irregular nuclei are noted.
Renal tubular epithelial cells: They are slightly larger than leukocytes
27

and have a large, eccentrically placed round nucleus that takes up half
the area of the cytoplasm. Their presence in significant numbers (>15
cells in 10 high-power fields) may be seen with tubular injury. Tubular
epithelial cells from the proximal tubule tend to be very granulated.
Oval fat bodies: They are renal epithelial cells that are filled with lipids.
They also appear granulated but are distinguished by characteristic
“Maltese crosses” seen under polarized light, reflecting their cholesterol
content. Oval fat bodies are typically seen in nephrotic syndrome and
indicate lipiduria.
Casts
Casts are formed when proteins secreted in the lumen of renal tubules
(typically the Tamm–Horsfall protein) trap cells, fat, bacteria, or other
inclusions at the time of amalgamation and then are excreted in the
urine. Thus, a cast provides a snapshot of the milieu of the tubule at the
time of this amalgamation.9
Hyaline casts:
Renal tubules secrete a protein called Tamm–Horsfall protein
(uromodulin). Under certain circumstances, the protein amalgamates on
its own without any other tubular inclusions, forming hyaline casts.
They are better seen with phase-contrast microscopy.
They are seen in concentrated, acidic urine.
They are not associated with proteinuria and can be seen with various
physiologic states, such as strenuous exercise or dehydration.
Granular casts:
They are made of Tamm–Horsfall protein filled with breakdown debris
of cells and plasma proteins that appear as granules.
They are nonspecific and appear with many glomerular or tubular
diseases.
28

Large numbers of “muddy brown” granular casts are typically seen in
acute tubular necrosis.
They have also been reported after vigorous exercise.
Waxy casts:
They represent the last stage in degeneration of hyaline, granular, and
cellular casts.
They have smooth, blunt ends.
They are usually seen with chronic kidney disease rather than acute
processes.
Polarized light should be used to distinguish waxy casts from artifacts,
which tend to polarize unlike true casts.
Fatty casts:
They contain lipid droplets that are very refractile.
They may be confused with cellular casts, but polarized light
demonstrates the characteristic Maltese cross appearance.
They are associated with nephrotic syndrome, mercury poisoning, and
ethylene glycol poisoning.
Red cell casts:
They are identified by their orange–red color on bright-field microscopy
and well-defined cellular elements.
They are best seen in fresh urine. At times, they may appear fractured.
Red cell casts signify glomerular hematuria and are an important
finding, suggesting potentially serious glomerular disease. Detection of
red cell casts should trigger further rigorous evaluation of the patient.
White cell casts:
29

They contain WBCs trapped in tubular proteins.
Sometimes WBCs appear in the urine in clumps, and it is important not
to confuse them with casts. Phase-contrast microscopy is useful to
demonstrate protein matrix of the cast, which is not seen in white cell
clumps or pseudocasts.
They are associated with interstitial inflammatory processes, such as
pyelonephritis.
Epithelial cell casts:
They are characterized by epithelial cells of various shapes, haphazardly
arranged in a protein matrix representing desquamation from different
portions of the renal tubules.
Crystals
Cooling of urine allows many normally dissolved substances to
precipitate at room temperature. Thus, most crystals are present as
artifacts and may be present in the urine without an underlying disease.
The formation of crystals also depends on urinary pH.
Crystals that precipitate in acidic urine are as follows: uric acid,
monosodium urate, amorphous urates, and calcium oxalate.
Crystals that precipitate in alkaline urine are as follows: triple
phosphate, ammonium biurate, calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate, and
calcium carbonate.
Calcium-based crystals are among the most commonly encountered.
Calcium oxalate crystals appear in characteristic octahedral
“envelope” shapes. They may also take rectangular, dumbbell, and ovoid
shapes (may be confused with RBCs).
Triple phosphate crystals are usually three- to six-sided prisms in
“coffin-lid” form but may present as flat, fern leaf-like sheets.
30

Calcium phosphate crystals are usually small rosettes.
Calcium carbonate usually presents as tiny spheres in pairs or crosses.
Crystals produced from pathologic excess of metabolic products (e.g.,
cystine, ​tyrosine, leucine, bilirubin, and cholesterol) are seen more
frequently in acidic urine.
Drug-associated crystals (e.g., acyclovir, indinavir, sulfonamides, and
ampicillin) are seen in more acidic concentrated urine.
Uric acid crystals come in various forms, including rhomboid, rosettes,
lemon shaped, and four-sided “whetstones.” Other urate forms are very
tiny crystals, spheres, or needles that are hard to distinguish.
Ammonium biurate, which is usually seen in aged urine, is usually a
dark, ​yellow sphere with a “thorn apple” shape.
Cystine crystals are hexagons that can polarize and are confused with
uric acid crystals.
Tyrosine and leucine crystals usually occur together. The former forms
fine needles arranged in rosettes, whereas the latter forms spheres with
concentric striations like the core of a tree.
Bilirubin crystals occur in many shapes but are usually distinguished by
the bilirubin color.
Cholesterol crystals are usually flat with a corner notch and are
sometimes confused with crystals of contrast medium, which also have a
corner notch.
Sulfonamide crystals appear as spheres or needles. Ampicillin crystals
usually take a long, slender needle shape. Acyclovir crystals have a
similar needle-like shape but display negative birefringence under
polarized light.
Organisms
31

Bacteria:
They are frequently seen in urine specimens, given the fact that urine is
typically collected under nonsterile conditions.
Gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli tend to predominate in
uncomplicated UTI, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and
occasionally by Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterococci, Group B Streptococci,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Citrobacter species.
Complicated UTI may be caused by a myriad of organisms. Identification
and susceptibilities of these organisms typically require high-powered
magnification, staining, culture, and in vitro testing against antibiotics.
Fungal:
Presence of Candida in urine is typically thought to be a contaminant
from genital secretions or, in the presence of a long, indwelling bladder
catheter, colonization.
Candida UTIs can cause similar symptoms to that seen with a bacterial
infection.
Candida species are the most frequent cause of fungal UTIs, with C.
albicans as the most common, followed by C. glabrata and C. tropicalis.
Candida may have the appearance of yeast (spherical cells), budding
yeast, and pseudohyphae depending on reproductive cycle.
Other infectious fungal agents, including Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and
Histoplasmosis, can be seen in the chronically ill or immunocompromised
patients.
Parasites:
Presence of Trichomonas vaginalis and Enterobius vermicularis in urine are
typically thought of as contaminants stemming from genital secretions.
Trichomonads are single-celled, flagellated protozoans characterized by
32

their “corkscrew” motility, which can cause a sexually transmitted
disease, with white vaginal discharge and itching as part of its symptoms.
Enterobius vermicularis (human pinworm) do not typically reside in the
urinary tract, but may occasionally be found in the vagina leading to
urine contamination.
Painful hematuria with exposure to fresh river waters in endemic areas is
characteristic of Schistosoma haematobium. The large, abundant ova can
be detected in a fresh urine sample, with the urine tending to be dark in
color.

Assessment of Kidney Function
Imran A. Memon

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Assessing kidney function is a critical step in the recognition and
monitoring of acute and chronic kidney diseases (CKD).
Creatinine measurement has become the preferred method for routine
clinical monitoring of renal function.
Clinicians need to understand the assumptions and pitfalls regarding the
various measurements of kidney function, in order to use and interpret
them appropriately.
Pathophysiology
Kidney function is best reflected by the glomerular filtration rate
(GFR).
GFR is defined as the sum of the filtration rates of all functional
nephrons.
The normal GFR is ∼125 mL/min/1.73 m2 in men and 100 mL/min/
1.73 m2 in women.
A decline in nephron numbers may not necessarily result in a decline of
GFR, as the remaining nephrons can increase filtration rate to
compensate.
For example, one might expect a 50% reduction in GFR after the
donation of a kidney. However, the measured GFR is often at 80% of
prenephrectomy levels because of compensatory hyperfiltration in the
35

remaining kidney.
Changes in GFR parallel changes in overall filtering capacity of the
kidney.
An increase in GFR, as seen in early diabetic nephropathy, can reflect
glomerular hyperfiltration, whereas a fall in GFR can reflect kidney
injury and disease.
The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines separate CKD
into five stages of progressive decline (Table 2-1).
The classification into CKD stage can be misleading.
A GFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 has half of the renal function as a GFR of
60 mL/min/1.73 m2, even though they are both classified as stage III
CKD.
A GFR of 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 has virtually the same renal function as a
GFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, even though one is classified as stage IV and
the other is classified as stage III.
Damage to specific components of the nephron may initially manifest in
other ways, without a prominent fall in GFR.
Damage to the glomerular architecture may initially present with
proteinuria only.
Damage to the tubules may result in solute wasting or concentration
defects.

36

Structural diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease, can be detected on
ultrasound prior to any changes in GFR.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Creatinine
Creatinine is a metabolic product of creatine derived mainly from
skeletal muscle cells and dietary meat.
The typical daily production rates are 20 to 25 mg/kg/d in men and 15
to 20 mg/kg/d in women.
Persons with larger muscle mass have a higher creatinine production and
level than those with a smaller muscle mass.
The normal range for creatinine is reported between 0.4 and 1.5 mg/dL.
The kidney eliminates creatinine by glomerular filtration and, to a lesser
extent, by proximal tubular secretion.
In persons with normal kidney function, glomerular filtration accounts
for >90% of creatinine elimination.
Creatinine is not reabsorbed or metabolized to any significant degree in
the kidney.
37

FIGURE 2-1. The nonlinear relationship between rise in plasma
creatinine and fall in the glomerular ltration rate. (Adapted from
Lazarus JM, Brenner BM, eds. Acute Renal Failure. 3rd ed. New
York, NY: Churchill Livingstone; 1993:133.)
Creatinine is clinically used to track kidney function, as it accumulates
when renal elimination is compromised.
An upward trend in creatinine suggests a reduction in GFR.
A downward trend in creatinine suggests an improvement in GFR.
It is important to realize that a change in plasma creatinine does not
correlate with a decline in renal function in a linear fashion (Fig. 21).
A small increase in creatinine at a lower creatinine level signals a
greater decline in renal function, as compared to the same increase in
creatinine when the baseline creatinine levels are high.
For example, a change of 1.0 to 1.4 mg/dL represents a greater decline
in kidney function than a change of 3.0 to 3.4 mg/dL.
Creatinine is not a perfect marker because of the variable
contribution of tubular secretion.
As renal function declines, tubular secretion of creatinine increases.
Therefore, creatinine-based estimations of GFR can overestimate renal
38

function because of the increasing proportion of creatinine eliminated by
tubular secretion in renal failure.
The measurement of creatinine can also be subject to intra-laboratory
variation.
Urea
The elimination of urea by the kidney is more complex than creatinine,
which renders the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) a less useful marker of
kidney function when evaluated in isolation.
BUN can be increased by a number of nonrenal etiologies, including
gastrointestinal bleeding, steroid use, and parenteral nutrition.
BUN can be reduced by malnutrition and liver disease, which reduce urea
generation rates.
For practical purposes, BUN is most informative when the ratio of
BUN: Cr exceeds 20:1, which is suggestive of a prerenal state.
Clearance
Clearance describes the quantity of fluid which is completely cleared of a
marker over a definite period of time.
It is usually expressed in mL per minute.
The ideal marker should be biologically inert, freely and completely
filtered by the glomerulus, neither secreted nor absorbed by tubules, and
not degraded by the kidney.
With an ideal marker, GFR can be calculated from the measurements of
the marker’s clearance.
GFR = (UMarker × volume of urine/PMarker)/1440
Where, UMarker is the concentration of the marker in the urine.

39

Volume of urine is the volume produced over 24 hours (in mL).
PMarker is concentration of the marker in the plasma.
The value 1440 is used to convert the units to mL per minute (1440
minutes in 24 hours).
Inulin was the classic gold standard marker for such measurements, but
has been superceded by other substances such as iothalamate,
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid,
and iohexal.
Although these methods are useful in obtaining a very accurate GFR
measurement, they are inconvenient for most purposes and are used only
in specific situations that require more precision than estimates from
creatinine clearance (CrCl).
Although creatinine is not a perfect marker because of the contribution
of tubular secretion, it is easily measurable and is clinically used to
estimate GFR.
CrCl can be estimated through equation-based estimations or by a 24hour urine collection.
Creatinine-based equations: There are two widely used equations used to
estimate kidney function in adults based on their serum creatinine levels
in conjunction with basic patient characteristics.
Cockcroft–Gault equation:

The Cockcroft–Gault equation was originally developed in a male
inpatient population but has been found to be reasonably accurate in
other populations.1
The main pitfalls of this estimate are determining the patient’s
actual lean body weight and overestimation of true GFR by CrCl
40

with lower levels of kidney function.
MDRD equation:

Abbreviated MDRD equation:

The MDRD equation was developed in established outpatient CKD
patients using 125I-iothalamate renal clearance as a reference.2
In CKD patients with measured GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the
MDRD equation correlates well. It has not been well validated in other
patient populations.3 For instance, it is not useful in persons with
normal renal function, and was not validated in persons aged >70
years or in hospitalized or malnourished patients.4 It is also does not
measure true GFR in patients with advanced kidney disease.5
The MDRD equation has an adjustment factor for African American
populations,6 but not for Hispanic or Asian populations.7,8
Limitations of equation-based CrCl.
In renal transplant donors, both the MDRD and the Cockcroft–Gault
equation significantly underestimate the measured GFR by as much as 9%
to 29%.9
MDRD study equation was derived from predominantly white subjects
who had nondiabetic kidney disease.
MDRD equation is reasonably accurate in nonhospitalized patients
known to have CKD, regardless of diagnosis.
The MDRD study equation and the Cockcroft–Gault equation may not be
accurate in obese individuals.
The MDRD equation and the Cockcroft–Gault equation may not be
41

accurate in different age groups; they provided higher estimates at
younger ages and lower estimates at older ages.10
The MDRD study and the Cockcroft–Gault equation are less accurate in
populations with normal or near-normal GFR.11
Among recipients of renal allograft, these equations have variable
accuracy in predicted true GFR.12
These equations may be less accurate in a population of different
ethnicities outside the United States.13,14
The 24-hour CrCl.
The 24-hour urine collection has been used as a semi-gold standard to
evaluate kidney function in the clinical setting, particularly when
equations may not be sufficiently accurate (Table 2-2).
CrCl can be measured by collecting a 24-hour urine sample and using
the following formula:

Where UCreatinine is the concentration of creatinine in the urine.
Volume of urine is the volume produced over 24 hours (in mL).
PCreatinine is concentration of creatinine in the plasma.
The value 1440 is used to convert the units to mL per minute (1440
minutes in 24 hours).
In the intensive care unit setting, shorter-timed collection (e.g., 8 or
12 hours) can also be done to decrease collection errors.15
Increased creatinine excretion occurs as GFR falls, resulting in a normal
estimation of CrCl in 25% to 50% of the patients with true GFR of 51 to
70 mL/min.
42

Differential Diagnosis
An estimation of GFR using any of these techniques should give clinicians
a fairly accurate impression of overall kidney function. However, there
are pitfalls that an astute clinician must be aware of.
Factors affecting serum creatinine.
Trimethoprim and cimetidine block proximal tubular secretion of
creatinine. They can increase plasma creatinine level up to as much as
0.5 mg/dL. This effect is more pronounced in CKD when baseline
creatinine is already elevated.16,17
Cefoxitin and flucytosine interfere with the creatinine assay, giving a
false elevation of plasma creatinine levels.18,19
Acetoacetate in diabetic ketoacidosis can be falsely recognized by the
colorimetric assay as creatinine and may elevate creatinine by as much
as 0.5 to 2 mg/dL.20
43

Hypothyroidism increases plasma creatinine levels and hyperthyroidism
decreases plasma creatinine levels.21,22
Factors affecting CrCl.
The limitations of equation-based calculations are listed above.
Two major factors that can limit the accuracy of the 24-hour urine
collections are incomplete urine collection and increasing creatinine
secretion.23
Meticulous volume collection is important to prevent over collection
(thus overestimating CrCl) or under collection (thus underestimating
CrCl). Table 2-3 lists the steps needed for collecting a 24-hour urine
sample.
Completeness of urine collection can be assessed by calculating the total
creatinine excretion per kg of body weight. It should be ∼20 to 25 mg/kg
of lean body weight for men and 15 to 20 mg/kg for women.
Measurement of CrCl at two separate occasions can also help in
improving accuracy.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: FUTURE DIRECTIONS
IN TESTING METHODOLOGIES
There is an active ongoing search for newer markers that will accurately
predict GFR and detect early loss of renal function.
Cystatin C holds promise, as it has a constant daily production and is
excreted by the kidney.24
Cystatin C is a low molecular weight protein that is a member of cystatin
superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors. It is thought to be produced
by all nucleated cells and its rate of production is thought to be
constant.25
Cystatin C is filtered at the glomerulus and not reabsorbed, but is
44

metabolized in the tubules, limiting its utility in measuring clearance
directly.26
Recently, it has been reported that many factors affect the cystatin C
levels,27 but despite these findings cystatin C may correlate more closely
to GFR than creatinine, and it has been proposed that cystatin C-based
equations may be more accurate28 in populations with lower creatinine
production such as the elderly, children, renal transplant recipients, and
patients with cirrhosis.29
Despite the potential accuracy of cystatin C in assessment of GFR, it is
unclear whether measurement of cystatin C will improve patient care.

Renal Biopsy
Imran A. Memon

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diagnosis of many kidney diseases depends on histologic evaluation of
tissue.
Early biopsy methods were done with manual needle systems and
without the benefit of imaging, resulting in higher complication rates and
poor tissue yield.1,2
Modern techniques now use accurate ultrasound imaging and
semiautomatic needle biopsy devices to obtain samples of renal cortex for
histopathologic exam to aid in the specific diagnosis of renal diseases.

DIAGNOSIS
The tissue obtained from renal biopsy is invaluable to the diagnosis of
many forms of kidney diseases. It provides crucial information about the
localization of kidney injury, the basic underlying mechanisms, and the
patterns of injury, which, along with a clinical correlate, can make an
appropriate diagnosis.3
Localization:
A tissue diagnosis allows one to appreciate which segments of the kidney
are most affected by the injury.
Generally, these areas are categorized as glomerular, tubular, interstitial,
or vascular components of the kidney.
Mechanisms:
49

The presence of certain types of infiltrative cells can be extremely
helpful in making a diagnosis.
For example, a dense infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in the
interstitium points toward acute interstitial nephritis.
Patterns of injury:
Certain patterns of injury characterize many of the forms of kidney
injury, particularly in the glomerulus.
For example, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis describes a pattern of
injury in which there is “segmental” injury (discrete areas of sclerosis
without involving the entire glomerular tuft) to a “focal” subset of
glomeruli (some, but not all, glomeruli exhibit this pattern).
Generally, patients who benefit most from renal biopsy and subsequent
pathologic diagnosis have nephrotic syndrome, a nephritic presentation,
acute renal failure, proteinuria and hematuria, or renal allograft
dysfunction (Table 3-1).
Several studies have shown that ∼40% of patients subjected to renal
biopsy will have a change of diagnosis or management based on the
results of the biopsy. 4
Adult patients with nephrotic syndrome generally require a kidney
biopsy because treatment algorithms vary for the disorders depending on
the pathology.

50

Patients with acute renal failure without clear etiology need to be
evaluated for interstitial nephritis, acute nephritic syndromes, or systemic
disorders, such as systemic lupus eythematosus or small-vessel vasculitis.
The management of proteinuria or hematuria of unclear etiology can
be affected by biopsy results, although the decision process is more
complex depending on other clinical features.
In the evaluation of renal allograft dysfunction, renal transplant
biopsy is invaluable in diagnosing acute rejection or acute tubular
necrosis in the immediate posttransplant period. Deterioration in
previously stable renal function can also be evaluated when
distinguishing acute or chronic rejection from cyclosporine nephrotoxicity
or infection.

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Preprocedural Evaluation
Planning a biopsy requires assessing risks with a good history and
physical, laboratory assessment, and imaging (Table 3-2).

51

Renal imaging should be performed to ensure that the patient has two
kidneys of normal size and shape.
Native kidney biopsy is relatively contraindicated for atrophic
kidneys <9 cm in size, as the risk of capsular hemorrhage increases in
fibrotic kidneys (so does the risk of a low-yield biopsy result).
Renal biopsy of a solitary native kidney should be undertaken only
when absolutely necessary to preserve renal function, as there is a risk
of marked bleeding leading to nephrectomy.
It has been suggested that surgically performed open renal biopsy should
be the procedure of choice in this setting, but the risk of percutaneous
biopsy is so low that it may be lower than the risk of general anesthesia
and surgery.
Blood pressure (BP) should be optimally controlled, with diastolic BP
<95 mm Hg, to minimize bleeding complications.
Urine culture should be sterile before a biopsy attempt.
Blood coagulation parameters should be normalized as much as
possible before renal biopsy.
Systemic anticoagulants, including antiplatelet therapy, aspirin, and
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, should be discontinued ≥5 days
before renal biopsy.
52

Prothrombin Time (PT) should be <1.2 times control; activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be <1.2 times control.
The role for bleeding time or other functional platelet testing procedures
remains unclear, but is usually done to screen for unsuspected aspirin use
or other platelet disorders.
In a patient with renal insufficiency and elevated blood urea nitrogen
levels with a prolonged bleeding time, DDAVP, 0.4 mcg/kg IV for 2 to 3
hours, is usually given before biopsy.
The diagnostic and therapeutic utility of a renal biopsy in patients
needing chronic anticoagulation should be carefully considered and
balanced with the risk of reversal of anticoagulation and of postbiopsy
bleeding. Consultation with cardiologists and hematologists may be
needed.
One approach is to allow the international normalized ratio (INR) to
decline to 1.5 over several days or to reverse the anticoagulation with
vitamin K, depending on the urgency of the biopsy.
Intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin should be stopped
at least 6 hours prior to the procedure and should not be resumed until at
least 18 to 24 hours after the procedure.
Informed consent should be obtained from the patient by the
physician(s) performing the biopsy.
Risks, benefits, possible complications, and alternatives to the procedure
should always be discussed in detail with the patient.
Difficult or high-risk biopsies (e.g., single kidney, morbid obesity,
requirement for ongoing systemic anticoagulation) should be given
careful consideration as to whether risks outweigh benefits. The main
contraindications for renal biopsy are given in Table 3-3.
Consideration may be given to computed-tomography-guided biopsy,
trans
jugular biopsy, or open biopsy, depending on local center expertise.
53

Procedure for Native Kidney Biopsy
Patient position is the most critical step in performing a successful
kidney biopsy.
The patient should lie prone on the examination table, with or without a
support under the upper abdomen.
If the patient is pregnant or very obese, biopsy can be performed in the
seated or lateral decubitus position.
The decision to perform biopsy on the left or right kidney depends on
imaging quality, presence of cysts, and operator preference.
Ultrasound guidance should be used to localize the lower pole of the
kidney and mark the overlying skin site.
Particular attention should be given to the depth and angle of the renal
cortex in relation to the skin entry site of the biopsy needle (this will
minimize the risk of puncturing a major vessel).
The amount and direction of movement of the kidney in relation to
inspiration and expiration should be carefully noted, especially if realtime ultrasound is not used during the actual biopsy.
Sterile technique should be followed to prepare the skin entry site with
54

Betadine and to drape the field with sterile towels.
Local anesthetic (e.g., 1% lidocaine + bicarbonate) should be injected
with a small-gauge needle to raise a skin wheal and then infiltrated down
to the capsule of the kidney along the anticipated biopsy tract with a
larger needle.
Needle insertion:
A scalpel should be used to make a small stab incision at the skin site.
A variety of biopsy needles are commercially available.
Most commonly, 16- or 18-gauge needles are used, as sample size is poor
with smaller needle gauges.
The incidence of major bleeding complications is lower with a springloaded needle under ultrasound guidance compared with manual needles.
The biopsy needle should be advanced (either with or without real-time
ultrasound guidance with a sterile probe) just short of the depth of the
renal capsule. The patient may breathe normally during this phase.
Since the kidney normally moves up and down with the respiratory cycle,
the patient should be asked to hold his or her breath as the biopsy needle
is slowly advanced through the capsule.
Once the biopsy needle is appropriately positioned in the renal cortex,
clear movement of the needle should be obvious with the patient’s normal
breathing.
The patient should again be asked to hold his or her breath while the
biopsy gun is fired to obtain the core sample. The biopsy needle can then
be withdrawn and the core recovered for pathologic exam.
A pathology technician is invaluable for examining the core of tissue
under an operating microscope to determine if sufficient glomeruli are
present.
55

Usually, two to three cores suffice for an adequate biopsy, with one core
fixed in formalin for light microscopy and the remainder divided for
electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and special studies.
An adequate sample is usually obtained when a total of 10 to 15
glomeruli are present.
Renal Allograft Biopsy
Biopsy of a transplanted kidney is simplified by the superficial
abdominal location of the allograft.
Standard indications are summarized in Table 3-4.
Biopsy can be done as an outpatient, as risk of significant bleeding is
much less than with native biopsy.
Transplant biopsies are usually done with real-time ultrasound guidance,
as the kidney does not move with the respiratory cycle.
After the core tissues are obtained, direct pressure should be applied to
the biopsy site for ≥15 minutes to control local bleeding, with a sandbag
placed at the site afterward.
Patients are usually observed for 6 hours and may then go home in the
absence of complications or other factors.

ROUTINE POSTBIOPSY CARE
The major complication rate (bleeding severe enough to require
transfusion or invasive procedure, septicemia, acute renal obstruction or
failure, or death) is 6.4%, whereas the rate of minor complications is
6.6% (the rate of complications would likely be higher among clinicians
with less experience).5

56

Observation of patients for ∼24 hours is usually done to avoid
missing most complications.
Clinical recognition of a major complication occurs within 8 to 24 hours
among 67% and 91% of patients, respectively. 6
Typically, the patient should remain supine for 6 hours and then remain
at bed rest overnight.
To help detect bleeding and other complications, vital signs are closely
monitored and complete blood counts are obtained at various time points
postbiopsy.
To minimize the risk of bleeding, BP should ideally be well controlled
(goal <140/90 mm Hg).7
In low-risk patients (e.g., serum creatinine concentration <2 mg/dL
[177 μmol/L], BP <140/90 mm Hg, and no evidence of coagulopathy), a
shorter observation period may be reasonable.

COMPLICATIONS
The main complications after biopsy are due to bleeding and pain (Table
3-5).
Hematuria and the formation of a perinephric hematoma occur to some
degree in all patients after renal biopsy, although only ∼3% to 10% of
patients experience gross hematuria.8
Serial examination of urine specimens for clearing of visible blood is
useful in these cases. Complete blood count should be monitored every 6

hours in all patients after renal biopsy.
A fall in hemoglobin of ∼1 g/dL is average after an uncomplicated renal
biopsy.
Blood loss requiring transfusion occurs in 2.4% to 5% of renal
biopsies.5,9
This will depend, in part, on prebiopsy hemoglobin and risk.
The most common site of significant blood loss is into the perinephric
space, leading to a large perinephric hematoma.
Subcapsular bleeds usually tamponade themselves. Significant bleeding
into the urinary collecting system may also occur, which manifests as
gross hematuria and may lead to ureteral obstruction.
Intervention to control bleeding is required in ∼0.3% of cases and
nephrectomy may be necessary in 0.06% of cases.10

Hypotension after renal biopsy can occur in 1% to 2% of patients and is
usually fluid responsive.11
Arteriovenous fistulas can be detected radiologically in up to 18% of
cases, but are rarely of clinical significance and usually resolve
spontaneously.12
58

The diagnosis is suggested by development of hypotension, high-output
heart failure, or persistent hematuria, and can be confirmed by color-flow
Doppler ultrasound.
Persistent pain at the biopsy site may result from a subcapsular or
perinephric hematoma or from renal colic as blood clots pass through the
collecting system.
Biopsy of nonrenal tissues (most commonly liver or spleen) can occur
inadvertently during an intended renal biopsy. Serious complications are
rare in these instances. Mortality rate was reported to be 0.1% in two
series, but is substantially lower using modern techniques.5,9

Approach to Proteinuria
Peter J. Juran

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition and Background
Increased protein in the urine is a common sign of kidney disease.
Typically, urinary protein is described in terms of total protein or total
albumin.
Normal individuals excrete <150 mg of total protein and <30 mg of
albumin in urine every 24 hours. Other proteins found in the urine are
either secreted by tubules (Tamm–Horsfall protein) or are small filtered
proteins that have escaped reabsorption or degradation by renal tubule
cells.
Any level of protein excretion in the urine >150 mg per 24 hours is
abnormal and merits further evaluation.
The urine dipstick is the most common initial screening test for
proteinuria, but is only sensitive for protein concentrations >20 mg/dL
(roughly equivalent to 300 mg per 24 hours).
Nephrotic syndrome is defined as a urine protein excretion >3.5 g per
24 hours, associated with hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema.
The same level of proteinuria without the other features is referred to as
nephrotic range proteinuria.
The approach to the patient with proteinuria is determined by the degree
of proteinuria, other renal manifestations, and the overall clinical
picture.

61

Why Test for Proteinuria?
Even relatively small increases in protein or albumin in the urine can be
early signs of kidney disease and often precede a detectable change in
glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
Persistently high levels of proteinuria may cause further kidney damage
and result in accelerated progression of kidney disease.
Proteinuria is a strong and independent risk factor for cardiovascular
disease and death, mostly in patients with advanced age, diabetes,
hypertension, and chronic kidney disease.1–3
Interventions that reduce the amount of proteinuria may retard the
progression of kidney disease and improve the prognosis of
cardiovascular disease.
Pathophysiology
Proteinuria can occur due to glomerular or tubular dysfunction.4
Glomerular proteinuria results from a disruption of the glomerular
filtration barrier, leading to increased filtration of plasma proteins in
amounts that exceed tubular reabsorptive capacity. If the amount of
protein in 24 hours exceeds 2 g, a glomerular disease is usually present.
Tubular proteinuria is a consequence of inadequate reabsorption of
filtered low-molecular-weight proteins (e.g., beta 2-microglobulin or
lysozyme), which then appear in the urine. Tubular proteinuria can
coexist with glomerular proteinuria or be an isolated finding in the
setting of defective proximal tubule function. Typically, tubular
proteinuria is <2 g per 24 hours.

Overflow proteinuria occurs when there is excessive systemic
production of abnormal proteins of small molecular weight that exceeds
the capacity of the tubule for reabsorption. A prime example is the
increased urinary excretion of light chains in myeloma. Occasionally,
lysozymuria appears in acute monocytic leukemia.
62

Tissue proteinuria is associated with an inflammatory or neoplastic
process within the urinary tract.
Classification of Proteinuria
Transient proteinuria:
Transient proteinuria is primarily seen in children and adolescents who
are healthy and asymptomatic, and who have normal urinary
sediment.5–7 It is believed to result from alterations in renal
hemodynamics.
Transient proteinuria disappears on repeat testing and requires no
further evaluation. Some individuals have recurrent episodes of
transient proteinuria that often goes into permanent remission within a
few years.
Some studies of this patient population have reported a histological
association and progression toward renal insufficiency and
hypertension.8 It is therefore recommended to monitor this subgroup
yearly.
Transient proteinuria can occur reversibly in hyperadrenergic states like
fever, exercise, congestive heart failure, seizures, use of vasopressors,
pregnancy, and obstructive sleep apnea. A 10% incidence of functional
proteinuria has been reported among ER admissions, with the most
common causes being congestive heart failure, seizures, and fever.
Pathogenesis is believed to be secondary to increased glomerular
permeability and decreased tubular reabsorption of proteins, possibly due
to angiotensin II or norepinephrine.9
Orthostatic proteinuria:
This syndrome is characterized by the excretion of abnormal quantities
of protein in the upright position, with normal levels of protein excretion
while in supine position.
Orthostatic proteinuria is present in up to 3% to 5% of adolescents and
63

young men, aged mostly <30 years.
Most patients have rates of protein excretion <2 g per 24 hours in the
upright position, although higher rates have been reported.10
Diagnosis can be made with 24-hour split urine collections in the supine
and upright positions. The 24-hour collection is divided into a 16-hour
daytime portion and an 8-hour overnight portion.
Long-term follow-up of these patients shows no deterioration in renal
function and spontaneous resolution in 50% of patients 10 years after
diagnosis.11
Persistent proteinuria
Persistent proteinuria is present regardless of position, activity level, or
functional status. It is established by confirming proteinuria on
subsequent testing a week or two after the first positive test.
It may result from an isolated kidney disease or may be part of a
multisystem process with renal involvement.
Patients with persistent proteinuria are typically classified as having
nephrotic or nonnephrotic range proteinuria, and by the presence or
absence of features of the nephrotic syndrome.

DIAGNOSIS
Semi-Quantitative Methods
Routine urine dipstick:
The simplest and least expensive method of detecting proteinuria is by
routine dipstick. This dye-impregnated paper uses tetrabromophenol blue
as a pH indicator. Urine albumin binds to the reagent and changes its
pH, which then results in a spectrum of color changes depending on the
degree of pH change. A typical scale for a positive test is shown in Table
4-1.
64

The lower threshold concentration for detection of protein by the routine
dipstick is ∼15 to 20 mg/dL. This is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour
urine protein of 300 to 500 mg.
False-positive and false-negative results may occur because these semiquantitative estimates of proteinuria are concentration dependent and
are therefore influenced by the degree of urinary concentration.
Highly concentrated urine may show an abnormal result even when the
absolute daily protein excretion is normal.
Highly dilute urine may show normal or only modestly elevated results
for protein concentration even when elevated amounts of protein are
excreted. Even with 30 mg/dL of protein, the dipstick can be negative up
to 50% of the time.
The dipstick will not detect nonalbumin proteins, such as
immunoglobulins, and thus false-negative results may be seen in diseases
such as multiple myeloma.
False-positive results can occur in patients who receive contrast up to
24 hours before the test. Also, false-positive results may occur when
highly alkaline urine overwhelms the dye’s buffer.
Sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) test:
Unlike routine dipstick, which detects only albumin, the SSA test detects
all proteins.

A positive SSA test in the context of a negative dipstick is indicative of
65

nonalbumin proteinuria, such as immunoglobulin light chains. Results of
the SSA test are recorded on a scale from 0 to 4+, similar to routine
dipstick.12
Albumin sensitive tests:
Test strips that are more sensitive to albumin are also available
(Albustix).
Dye-impregnated strips and special immunoassays can detect albumin
concentrations as low as 30 mg/d, which is far below the 300 mg per 24
hours threshold of the standard dipstick.
These strips can be used to screen for microalbuminuria, and their
sensitivity and specificity range from 80% to 97% and 33% to 80%,
respectively.
Implications of a positive dipstick:
Detection of proteinuria should prompt an examination of urinary
sediment. Any evidence of hematuria, red blood cell casts, or lipiduria
should be noted and may be a sign of underlying pathology.
Quantitative Methods
Spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio:
The degree of urinary dilution will directly affect protein concentration.
The concentration of creatinine in the urine serves as an internal control
for urine dilution. The ratio of protein to creatinine is therefore
independent of urine concentration.
As the rate of creatinine excretion remains fairly constant, the ratio of
protein to creatinine on a random specimen is a good estimate of the
amount of protein excreted.
The protein-to-creatinine ratio in a normal person is <0.2 and is
roughly equivalent to an excretion of <0.2 g per 24 hours per 1.73 m2.13
For instance, a ratio of 2 roughly translates to a 24-hour urinary protein
66

excretion of 2 g.
The accuracy of the total protein-to-creatinine ratio is related to the
assumption that daily creatinine excretion is only slightly >1000 mg per
24 hours per 1.73 m2.
The accuracy of the ratio is diminished when creatinine excretion is
either markedly increased, as in a muscular man (the ratio will
underestimate proteinuria), or markedly reduced, as in a cachectic
patient (the ratio will overestimate proteinuria).
Microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio:
The presence of increased amounts of urinary albumin is an important
marker for early kidney disease and cardiovascular risk. Validation of
this concept is strongest in early diabetic kidney disease, but may also
apply to other forms of kidney disease.
The term microalbuminuria resulted from early studies that used more
sensitive assays for albumin and detected its presence despite negative
results for usual dipstick tests for protein. Microalbuminuria thus refers
to a small amount of albuminuria and not a particular form of albumin.
The urinary albumin is most often assessed using the albumin
(microalbumin)-to-creatinine ratio on an untimed or spot specimen. The
microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio can be used in the same way as the
urine protein-to-creatinine ratio.
A value <30 mcg/g is considered normal, whereas values from 30 to
300 mcg/g indicate microalbuminuria. Values >300 mcg/g are detected
by the routine dipstick and fall into the category of overt proteinuria
(macroalbuminuria).
The microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio is the preferred routine
screening tool for all diabetic patients for detection of early
nephropathy.14 A single first-morning voided specimen has a sensitivity
and specificity of >90% when compared with a 24-hour collection, but
this varies when the urine samples are taken at other times of the day.
67

Falsely elevated values may be obtained with hyperglycemia, vigorous
exercise, infection, and ketoacidosis.
The 24-hour urine protein collection:
The 24-hour urine collection is the definitive method of urinary
protein quantification, but is used less often because of frequent errors
in collection, patient inconvenience, and the increased use of the proteinto-creatinine ratio.
A 24-hour urinary protein is preferable in patients in whom urine
creatinine excretion is less reliable (changing renal function, high and
low muscle mass).
To verify proper collection, a 24-hour urine creatinine should always
be measured in the same urine specimen. Excretion of creatinine in
male patients during a 24-hour period should be roughly 20 to 25 mg/kg
and for female patients it should be ∼15 to 20 mg/kg. If the amount of
creatinine in the urine sample is quite different from the expected range,
an error in the collection of the sample should be suspected.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO PROTEINURIA
Once proteinuria has been detected on a dipstick, the next step is to
confirm the abnormal result by repeat measurement after several
weeks with a freshly voided specimen.
No confirmatory test is needed if the proteinuria is heavy on dipstick.
Once proteinuria is confirmed, the next step is to quantify protein
excretion by a protein-to-creatine ratio, albumin-to-creatinine
ratio, or a 24-hour urine collection.
The history and physical examination should include a search for
symptoms and signs attributable to kidney disease and identify risk
factors for kidney disease. Key issues to be addressed are:
The presence and duration of common causes of kidney disease such as
68

diabetes and hypertension.
Features suggestive of a connective tissue disorder such as arthralgias,
arthritis, skin rashes, and constitutional symptoms.
Clinical features of malignancy should be sought. For example, solid
organ malignancies have been associated with membranous
nephropathy, whereas lymphomas have been associated with minimal
change disease.
Features suggestive of infections such as hepatitis, endocarditis, syphilis,
or human immunodeficiency virus should be explored. These disorders
can lead to many different forms of glomerular disease.
A complete drug history detailing all prescription, illicit,
herbal/alternative, and over-the-counter medications should be taken.
For example, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can cause nephrotic
syndrome.
A family history of kidney disease should be noted, such as hereditary
nephritis, nail–patella syndrome, or polycystic kidney disease.
Additional testing is determined by the clinical context. In all cases, a
urine sediment, GFR estimation, complete blood count, basic metabolic
profile, and serum albumin are appropriate. Urine protein
electrophoresis and serum protein electrophoresis should be ordered if
there is suspicion of an overflow proteinuria from myeloma, amyloidosis,
or other immunoglobulin diseases. Dysmorphic red blood cells in the
sediment or nephrotic range proteinuria would likely prompt a kidney
biopsy. An evaluation of the anatomy of the urinary tract is usually not
needed unless there is significant hematuria or history of recurrent
urinary tract infection (Fig. 4-1).
Therapy for proteinuria will depend on the specific etiology determined.

Approach to Hematuria
Peter J. Juran

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hematuria, or blood in the urine, can be a sign of serious underlying
pathology of the kidney or urinary tract. Therefore, it is important to
identify and, if necessary, treat the underlying disease at an early stage.
Hematuria can be either gross or microscopic:
Gross hematuria is blood in the urine that is grossly visible to the eye.
The American Urological Association (AUA) has defined microscopic
hematuria as three or more red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field
(HPF) on microscopic examination of urinary sediment from two out of
three properly collected urine specimens in average- or low-risk patients,
and from one out of three specimens in high-risk patients (defined
below).1
Epidemiology
Gross hematuria is estimated to have a community prevalence of 2.5%.
According to population-based studies, the prevalence of microscopic
hematuria varies widely depending on the age and sex distribution of the
populations at hand and on the method of detection that is utilized. The
prevalence in the general population ranges from 0.18% to 16.1%.2 It is
unclear whether there is a higher prevalence with increasing age.
Etiology
73

Hematuria can be glomerular or nonglomerular in origin.
Nonglomerular hematuria can be further divided into upper and
lower urinary tract.
In persons <50 years of age, the most common glomerular causes are
IgA nephropathy and thin basement membrane disease, whereas
nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, and urethritis are the
most common nonglomerular causes in that age group.
In persons >50 years of age, renal, prostate, and transitional cell
cancers (bladder/ureteral) are common nonglomerular sources of
bleeding, whereas IgA nephropathy continues to be the leading cause of
glomerular hematuria.
The various etiologies of hematuria are listed in Table 5-1.
Screening
Hematuria is usually an incidental finding on urinalysis (UA) dipstick
testing, and screening for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is
generally not recommended.
The presence of a positive dipstick result demands microscopic
analysis of the urine sediment for RBCs, as dipstick testing cannot
differentiate between RBCs, myoglobin, and hemoglobin.

74

Further investigation may be warranted depending on the clinical
scenario and risk for serious underlying disease.

DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION
Clinical Presentation
There is no consensus as to a standard protocol to be followed when
performing a hematuria workup. In 2001, the AUA published
recommendations on evaluating hematuria, and these recommendations
75

are partly incorporated into the algorithm shown in Figure 5-1.
Detection of hematuria:
In gross hematuria, urine may appear red, cola-colored, or brown. In
microscopic hematuria, it will appear clear and the diagnosis is usually
made by dipstick test.
The urine collection should be a freshly voided, clean-catch,
midstream urine specimen.
Dipstick testing:
It is highly sensitive (91% to 100%) but less specific (65% to 99%).3
False-negative results can be due to ingestion of large amounts of
ascorbic acid or other reducing agents, low pH, or the presence of
formaldehyde.
False-positive results can be due to semen, high pH, presence of
oxidizing agents, and myoglobinuria.
When positive, the urine sample should be centrifuged and the sediment
examined microscopically to count the number of RBCs per HPF (see
Chap. 1 about urine centrifugation).
Microscopic analysis:
It allows for examination of RBC morphology and the detection of RBC
casts.
Dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts are indicative of a glomerular
pathology and a renal cause for hematuria.
Dysmorphic urinary RBCs are best seen by phase-contrast microscopy
and are variable in size and shape, having irregular borders compared
with the normal, doughnut-shaped RBCs.
If >80% of urinary RBCs are dysmorphic, hematuria is more likely due
76

to a glomerular cause. If >80% of urinary RBCs are normal, this
indicates a lower urinary tract source of bleeding.
Dysmorphic RBCs may be seen in hematuria of nonglomerular origin and
isomorphic (normal morphology) RBCs can be seen in hematuria of
glomerular origin. The relative proportion of each type of RBC remains
the key to determining the origin of hematuria.
Acanthocytes, or doughnut-shaped RBCs with membrane blebs, have
also been used as a marker for glomerular bleeding, whereas crenated
RBCs (with spicules) are not usually relevant and indicate concentrated
urine.
History
Medications should be carefully reviewed as certain commonly
prescribed drugs can cause hematuria (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, busulfan, aspirin, oral contraceptives, and warfarin).
Over anticoagulation with warfarin may cause hematuria, but such a
presentation still warrants further investigation as underlying pathology
may be unmasked.4

77

FIGURE 5-1. Algorithm for microscopic hematuria evaluation. IVU,
intravenous urography; RBC, red blood cell; CT, computed
tomography.

Certain risk factors for significant disease should also prompt further
evaluation of hematuria: increased age (>40 years), cigarette smoking,
occupational exposure to chemicals, and high doses of cyclophosphamide
all increase the risk of transitional cell cancers of the bladder and the
urinary tract.
78

Gross hematuria is four times more likely than microscopic hematuria to
be associated with urothelial cancers, and is by itself considered a risk
factor for serious pathology. Table 5-2 lists the various risk factors for
significant urologic disease.
Patients should also be checked for signs of a glomerular etiology or
systemic disease and be examined for edema, purpura, and skin rashes.
Fever, dysuria, and flank pain are suggestive of pyelonephritis or a
complicated urinary tract infection.
Travel history may uncover a risk for schistosomiasis.
A family history of hematuria can be significant in Alport syndrome and
thin basement membrane disease.
Physical Examination
Physical examination should include measurement of blood pressure,
pulse, and volume status.
Hypertension could be a manifestation of glomerulonephritis.
Edema may be a sign of proteinuria.
Fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and suprapubic tenderness are
suggestive of an infectious etiology.
A nonblanching purpuric rash may be evidence of vasculitis.
Cardiovascular exam may reveal atrial fibrillation or murmurs due to
endocarditis—both sources for renal emboli.
Abdominal exam may reveal a mass, enlarged bladder, or polycystic
kidneys.
A detailed genitourinary exam should be performed to look for local
sources of bleeding and to exclude rectal or vaginal bleeding.

79

If a careful history and examination are suggestive of a benign source of
hematuria, urinalysis should be repeated 48 hours after cessation of the
precipitating cause (e.g., menstruation, vigorous exercise, sexual activity,
or trauma). If the hematuria has resolved, no further workup is
necessary.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory Evaluation
Laboratory evaluation should begin with urine dipstick testing and
microscopic examination of the urine sediment.
If pyuria or bacteriuria is present, urine culture should be obtained to
look for infection. If urine culture is positive, appropriate treatment with
antibiotics should be given and urine dipstick test and microscopy
examination repeated 6 weeks later to ensure resolution of hematuria.
If the hematuria has resolved, no further evaluation is needed.
If dipstick result is positive for protein, quantification of the
proteinuria is necessary. A ratio of urinary protein to urinary creatinine
in a spot urine specimen of >0.3 or a 24-hour urinary protein excretion
of >300 mg suggests a renal source of bleeding and warrants evaluation
by a nephrologist.
Serum creatinine should be checked and an abnormal value should
prompt a workup for renal disease. Complete blood count,
electrolytes, and blood urea nitrogen should also be obtained.
Dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, or acanthocytes in the urine suggest
glomerular bleeding and should be followed by a glomerulonephritis
workup, including measurement of antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies,
complement levels, cryoglobulins, serology for hepatitis B and C viruses,
and human immunodeficiency virus antibody test. A renal biopsy would
often be indicated at this point.
Urine cytology is indicated in those at risk for bladder cancer (Table 580

2). This test has only ∼66% to 79% sensitivity but very high specificity
(95% to 100%). Sensitivity is improved if the urine is collected on three
consecutive days from the first void sample in the morning. Sensitivity is
higher for carcinoma in situ and high-grade bladder cancer than for
cancers of low histologic grade. Urine cytology remains insensitive for
renal cell cancer.
Imaging
If infection and a glomerular source of bleeding are ruled out, imaging of
the upper urinary tract should be obtained to evaluate for renal cell
cancer, transitional cell cancer of the ureter or renal pelvis,
nephrolithiasis, cystic disease, or obstructive lesions.
Computed tomography (CT) is being used more frequently now as the
initial study, although traditionally intravenous urography (IVU) had
been recommended as the modality of choice.
Computed tomography:
This is the best modality for the detection of stones (94% to 98%
sensitivity) and solid masses of the urinary tract, as well as renal and
perirenal infections or abscesses.
If possible, a noncontrast helical CT should be done first to evaluate for
stones. If this is negative or if the patient has risk factors for renal or
transitional cell cancer, CT urography should then be obtained.
Although CT is more expensive than either IVU or ultrasound, these tests
are often followed by additional cross sectional imaging, resulting in
even greater expense.
CT detects masses <3 cm in size that can be missed by IVU or
ultrasound. High detection rates for transitional cell carcinoma have also
been reported for CT.
Disadvantages of CT include expense, risk of contrast nephropathy
(which can also occur with IVU), and availability. Note that in pregnancy
ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality.
81

Intravenous urography:
Traditionally, IVU has been the initial modality of choice for imaging of
the upper urinary tract, but has now been largely replaced by CT.
IVU is more sensitive than ultrasound for detection of transitional cell
cancer in the kidney or the ureter, but it cannot differentiate between
solid and cystic components. Thus, it is often followed by further imaging
such as ultrasound or CT.5
IVU is less costly than CT, but still carries the risk of contrast
nephropathy, and may miss upper tract lesions <3 cm in size.6
Ultrasound:
Ultrasound is excellent for characterizing solid versus cystic components,
but can miss lesions <3 cm (82% sensitivity for masses between 2 and 3
cm).
It is the preferred initial test in pregnancy, as it causes no harm to the
fetus.
Its use is becoming more limited in the evaluation of hematuria since the
advent of CT.
Diagnostic Procedures
Cystoscopy:
It is recommended that cystoscopy be performed as part of the initial
evaluation of microscopic hematuria in all adults older than 40 years of
age and in all those at risk for bladder cancer (Table 5-2).
Cystoscopy has a lower yield in patients younger than 40 years and in
those with no risk factors for malignancy. It can be deferred in these
cases but urinary cytology should be performed instead.
Disadvantages of cystoscopy include its invasive nature, risk for
iatrogenic infection, and patient discomfort.
82

Ureterorenoscopy:
Once the above radiologic tests are performed and are negative, fiber
optic imaging of the upper urinary tract and the kidney may be
performed.
Ureterorenoscopy is mostly done in patients who have recurrent
macroscopic hematuria with negative radiologic/laboratory workup or
hematuria that localizes to one side of the bladder on cystoscopy.7
Renal calculi or upper tract transitional cell carcinomas are found in 5%
to 10% of patients.
Discrete vascular lesions like arteriovenous malformations or
hemangiomas can be fulgurated and are found in 0.50% of cases.
Biopsies of lesions suspicious for neoplasm can be taken in the ureters or
the kidneys, with partial nephrectomy performed for those with high
suspicion of renal cell cancer.
Vascular lesions can be successfully treated with the holmium: yttrium–
aluminum–garnet laser.
Calculi can be extracted.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Some patients, who initially have a negative workup for microscopic
hematuria, eventually develop significant disease (although most do not).
Microscopic hematuria can precede bladder cancer and certain
glomerulonephritides by years, despite a negative initial evaluation. For
this reason, patient follow-up is recommended.
Repeating urinalysis and urine cytology at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months
in high-risk patients is recommended. In addition, in such high-risk
patients, repeat imaging or cystoscopy may be considered at 1 year.
Low-risk patients may be followed with periodic urinalysis and urine
83

cytology.
In patients who develop worrisome signs such as irritative voiding
symptoms or gross hematuria, further evaluation with imaging and
cystoscopy is warranted.
Positive cytology should naturally be followed by cystoscopy and
possibly imaging.
Immediate referral to a nephrologist should be done if proteinuria,
hypertension, or renal insufficiency were to develop during follow-up, as
they may be indicative of glomerular disease.
In cases of isolated microscopic hematuria that is persistent, renal biopsy
is controversial as available data does not suggest that identification of
the disease may alter management or outcome (e.g., IgA or thin
basement membrane
disease).

Disorders of Water Balance
Georges Saab

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Disorders of sodium (hypo- or hypernatremia) reflect abnormalities in
water homeostasis.1,2
Both hypo- and hypernatremia are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality in a number of clinical syndromes and disease states.3–6
Rapid correction of hypo- and hypernatremia additionally contributes to
these adverse outcomes.7
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as ‘arginine vasopressin,’ is the
main determinant of renal water regulation and free water balance. ADH
is secreted in response to an increase in plasma osmolarity, decreased
effective circulatory volume, and other factors such as pain, nausea, and
certain medications.
Disruption in ADH release or signaling, along with alterations in water
intake, all contribute to the development of hypo- or hypernatremia.
Plasma sodium is governed by the sum of the total body exchangeable
electrolytes divided by total body water (TBW).
Plasma sodium = (Na E + KE)/TBW (Eq. 1)8
Urinary electrolyte-free water clearance (CH20) is a measure of free water

excreted sans electrolytes for a particular urine volume V.

CH20 = V (1 – (UNa + UK)/PNa), where UNa and UK are urinary sodium
86

and potassium, respectively, and PNa is plasma sodium (Eq. 2)9
TBW is 50% and 60% of body weight (kg) for females and males,
respectively. In dehydrated patients, these estimates decrease by ∼10%
(i.e., 40% and 50%, respectively).
Definition: Hyponatremia
Hyponatremia is defined as a serum or plasma sodium concentration
<135 mmol/L.
Acute hyponatremia is defined as a fall in sodium over a period of <48
hours.
Classification
Pseudohyponatremia (isotonic hyponatremia) has classically been caused
by severe elevations of plasma lipids or proteins. Flame photometers
measure the sodium concentration in whole plasma, and assume that the
plasma water concentration is 93% of the plasma. Since sodium is
restricted to serum water, a marked increase in plasma lipids or plasma
proteins essentially “dilutes” the sodium concentration, as measured by
flame photometry.1 Alternate methods, using ion-specific electrodes, only
measure the concentration in the aqueous portion of plasma and will
provide a more accurate measure.10 Pseudohyponatremia is of no clinical
relevance save the recognition of this ​p henomenon and avoiding
unnecessary interventions that could potentially be harmful.
Hypertonic hyponatremia occurs when the extracellular plasma
osmolarity is increased. Here, the osmolarity of the extracellular space is
increased, drawing water movement from the intracellular to the
extracellular space. The increase in the aqueous fraction of plasma
thereby lowers the serum sodium concentration causing a true
hyponatremia.1
Hypotonic hyponatremia occurs when the extracellular plasma
osmolarity is decreased and is the most common form encountered in
clinical practice. This is primarily due to increased water intake and/or
87

impaired water excretion.1
Epidemiology
Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality among
hospital inpatients and is present on admission in 15% to 30% of
patients.6,11
When present, hyponatremia is an independent predictor of mortality,
even at mildly reduced levels, both in short and long terms.6
As expected, the prevalence of hyponatremia is lower in the general
ambulatory population (2% to 5%),5,11 but is still associated with poor
outcomes.5
Etiology
Isotonic hyponatremia:
Pseudohyponatremia from elevated lipids or proteins
Mannitol solution (5%)12 used as irrigant during surgical procedure
The solution is relatively isotonic, but does not contain sodium, and thus
hyponatremia occurs if large quantities are absorbed.
Hypertonic hyponatremia:
Hyperglycemia lowers [Na +] by 2.4 mmol/L for every 100 mg/dL
increase in the plasma glucose.13 Osmotic diuresis can cause water loss,
which may ultimately result in converting hyponatremia to
hypernatremia.
Intake of ethylene glycol, ethanol, and methanol
Hypotonic hyponatremia:
Low urine osmolality (<100 mOsm/kg): Primary polydipsia, severe
malnutrition, and beer potomania
88

High urine osmolality (>100 mOsm/kg):
Volume excess: Congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, renal
failure, and cirrhosis
Volume depletion
Euvolemia
Syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH)14 (see Table 6-1)
Hypothyroidism
Adrenal insufficiency (sometimes)
Glycine (1.5%)15 or sorbitol (3%)1 solution used as irrigant during
surgical procedure
As opposed to mannitol, these agents are hypotonic to plasma and thus a
hypotonic hyponatremia occurs when large volumes are absorbed.
Reduction in serum sodium is often initially out of proportion to
reduction in plasma osmolarity because of the fact that these agents are
effective osmoles and facilitate water transfer from the intra- to
extracellular space. However, glycine slowly diffuses into cells and
sorbitol is rapidly metabolized, and thus plasma osmolarity will slowly
decrease to the level expected by serum sodium.

89

Pathophysiology
As plasma sodium and tonicity drops, cells in the brain must readjust
intracellular osmolality by lowering the osmotic content. If changes occur
rapidly or in the face of severe hyponatremia, this adaptation fails,
leading to cerebral edema, altered mental status, and seizures.1
Hyponatremia can be fatal should brainstem herniation result.
Patients with underlying metabolic disorders, such as cirrhosis16 or
preexisting neurologic disease, as well as children and young women,17
may be at particular risk of severe complications without rapid reversal
of acute hyponatremia.
Central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination)7,18,19 is thought to be
due to rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. Alcoholic patients and
those with severe malnutrition appear to be at particular risk for osmotic
demyelination due to rapid sodium correction.1 Cognitive, behavioral,
and movement disorders due to the occurrence of osmotic demyelination
may not be apparent for days after the correction of hyponatremia, and
visible changes on magnetic resonance imaging scan may take weeks to
appear. This does not appear to be a major concern in the correction of
90

acute hyponatremia.

RISK FACTORS
Comorbid conditions: Congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic
syndrome, renal failure, alcoholism, and malignancy (SIADH)
Medications:
Impairing water excretion: Thiazide
SIADH: Antidepressants, antipsychotics14
Volume depletion: Diuretics20
Psychiatric illness (polydipsia)21

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
It is usually asymptomatic until serum sodium <125 mmol/L, but
fatalities have been reported with an extremely rapid decrease from a
normal [Na +] to the 120- to 128-mmol/L range.
Symptoms include central nervous system (CNS) effects, such as
confusion, weakness, headache, obtundation, or seizures, with acute
hyponatremia.1
Chronic hyponatremia (developing over >48 hours) is generally fairly
well tolerated. Symptoms include cognitive defects as well as nausea,
vomiting, weakness, and headache.1
History
A thorough history should include the estimated duration of inciting
factors and an assessment of signs or symptoms suggesting that
immediate intervention may be necessary (mental status change,
91

lethargy, coma, seizure). Management of a patient with hyponatremia
depends on whether the process is considered to be acute or chronic and
the severity of symptoms.
Physical Examination
The physical exam should be geared toward assessing the volume status
of the patient. Elevated blood pressure, an S3 heart sound, or increased
jugular venous pressure indicates volume excess often in the setting of
early congestive heart failure. Edema in the lower extremities or
presacral region or evidence of pulmonary edema indicates increased
extracellular fluid volume in heart failure and kidney disease. Conversely,
orthostatic hypotension, decreased skin turgor, dry mucosal membranes,
and decreased jugular venous pressure suggest intravascular volume
depletion.
Diagnostic Testing
Blood tests:
Renal function panel, plasma osmolarity, thyroid-stimulating hormone,
and cortisol level
Calculate osmolar gap:
Calculated plasma osmolarity = 2 × [Na] + (BUN/2.8) + (glucose/18)
Osmolar gap = Measured−calculated plasma osmolarity
Urine tests:
Urine osmolarity, urine sodium, urine potassium, urine protein, and
urine creatinine
Imaging:
Head computed tomography (CT), if the patient has neurologic
symptoms

92

Chest x-ray to evaluate for lung cancer
Diagnostic Criteria
Plasma osmolarity:
Isotonic:
Pseudohyponatremia: Confirm hyponatremia via ion-specific electrodes.
If unconfirmed, measure plasma lipid and protein levels.
Mannitol (5%): Review of medications will reveal likely etiology if
hyponatremia is confirmed via ion-specific electrodes.
Hypotonic:
Examination of volume status
Hypovolemic: will have low urine sodium (<20 mmol/L) and high urine
osmolality (>100 mOsm/kg)
Euvolemic:
SIADH: High urine sodium (>40 mmol/L) and high urine osmolality
(>100 mOsm/kg)
Primary polydipsia\beer potomania: Low urine sodium (<20 mmol/L)
and low urine osmolality (<100 mOsm/kg). Clinical history will confirm
studies.
Hypervolemic:
Congestive heart failure (physical exam): Elevated jugular venous
pressure, S3 gallop, peripheral edema, and crackles on lung exam. Low
urine sodium (<20 mmol/L) and high urine osmolality (>100 mOsm/kg)
Cirrhosis (physical exam): Ascites, peripheral edema, palmar erythema,
spider angiomata, jaundice, and caput medusa. Low urine sodium
(<20 mmol/L)
93

Nephrotic syndrome (physical examination with edema): Periorbital and
peripheral edema. Low urine sodium (<20 mmol/L) and nephrotic range
proteinuria (>3 g over 24 hours)
Hypertonic:
Toxic ingestions: Elevated osmolar gap (>10 mOsm/L), elevated anion
gap (>12 mmol/L), and acidosis. Measurement of toxic compound is
definitive diagnosis.
Hyperglycemia: No osmolar gap as glucose is included in the calculated
plasma osmolarity. Hyperglycemia will obviously be present.

TREATMENT
Chronic Asymptomatic Hyponatremia
Chronic hyponatremia without acute neurologic events is best treated by
fluid restriction.
Experts have suggested that examining the urinary electrolyte content
will aid in determining the degree of fluid restriction. The ratio of (urine
sodium + urine potassium)/plasma sodium can be used as a guide.9
1: No free water.
0.5 to 1.0: 500 mL.
0.5: 1000 mL
If the ratio >1, the patient is excreting no electrolyte-free water and any
water ingested will be retained. Withholding free water will allow the
concentration of serum sodium to rise via insensible water losses (800 to
1000 mL/d).9 For a ratio of 0.4, 60% of urine volume is electrolyte-free
water (from Eq. 2). If the patient produces 2000 mL of urine that day,
1200 mL will be electrolyte-free water. Restricting fluid intake to 1000
mL will result in a net of 1000 mL −
(1200 + 800 mL) = −1000 mL of free water lost per day. Accordingly,
94

the above recommendations should be adjusted to the patient’s urine
output. These recommendations also assume that the urinary electrolyte
loss is matched by dietary intake.
Chronic treatment of SIADH seldom requires pharmacologic agents and
these are usually reserved for cases resistant to the above interventions.
Lithium and demeclocycline both induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus22
and have been used to treat SIADH; however, the former is unpredictable
and can have numerous side effects, whereas the latter is expensive and
potentially nephrotoxic.1 Either can cause severe hypernatremia without
adequate free water intake.
Oral urea is another safe alternative for cases of refractory SIADH.
Palatability is probably its biggest drawback, but doses of 30 to 60 g/d
reportedly are effective in managing SIADH.23
New classes of agents that block vasopressin-2 receptors (aquaretics) are
being evaluated for use in SIADH and other states of ADH excess. So far,
they have only been approved for the short-term management of
hyponatremia.24
Acute and/or Symptomatic Hyponatremia
Hyponatremia—acute or chronic—presenting with significant symptoms,
may necessitate emergent therapy with hypertonic saline. Loop diuretics
are often used in tandem to aid in free water excretion (by lowering the
Uosm) and to prevent volume overload.
Severe CNS symptoms due to hyponatremia usually respond to very
modest increases in serum sodium, often a <5% increase in the
presenting value.1
The initial rate of correction generally should be 1 to 2 mmol/L/h, unless
persistent symptoms such as continued seizure activity justify a faster
reversal rate.1
Once symptoms have been controlled, the rate of correction is adjusted to
95

no more than a total of 8 mmol/L in the first 24 hours, including the
initial rapid correction.1
Over the next 24 hours, sodium correction should probably not exceed an
additional 10 mmol/L. More rapid correction increases the risk of osmotic
demyelination, especially in chronic hyponatremia.
Serum sodium should be checked frequently, every 1 to 2 hours, to avoid
overcorrection.
The human body is not a closed system and one must take into account
urinary losses of electrolytes and insensible water losses when calculating
replacement strategies.
Potassium replacement can increase serum sodium concentration and
may result in overcorrection.25
For example, in a 70 kg male with SIADH and a sodium concentration of
110 mmol/L with mild mental status changes, urine sodium is 100
mmol/L and urine potassium is 71 mmol/L.
Assume that changes are due to water gain, calculate the TBW.
Initially, with normal serum sodium, TBW for a male is 60% of body
weight in kg. In this case, 42 L.
Thus, using Eq. 1, we get (Na E + KE) = 42 * 110 mmol/L = 4620

mmol.

To increase serum sodium by 4 mmol/L over 2 hours, some ignore the
urinary and insensible losses.
Suppose V = volume of 3% saline administered. Thus, the original total
body exchangeable cations will increase by 513 mmol/L × V and the
new TBW is increased by V.
Using Eq. 1, (4620 + 513 × V)/(42 + V) = 114 and solving for V we
get 420 mL or 210 mL/h.
96

Giving normal saline may be harmful in this situation. Each I L of
normal saline contains 154 mmol of sodium. This will be excreted in
154/171 = 900 mL of urine, thus retaining 100 mL of water.
After loop diuretics such as furosemide, the urine is usually hypotonic to
plasma and is roughly half-normal saline solution in content.26 Thus, the
sodium in 1 L of normal saline given after furosemide would therefore be
excreted in 2 L of urine, creating a net loss of 1 L of free water.26
However, monitoring urine output and urine electrolyte is crucial,
because many may have more than one reason for hyponatremia (i.e.,
concomitant volume depletion) and hypertonic saline may suppress ADH
release, leading to a prompt aquaresis.27 If not accounted for, these
equations may markedly overestimate the degree of correction.
Calculations only provide a rough estimate to help initiate therapy
and do not replace frequent monitoring and adjustment. Accidental
overcorrection may occur if vigilant monitoring is not maintained, with
potentially fatal consequences. Treatment of accidental overcorrection
may be of benefit, especially if symptoms suggestive of osmotic
demyelination appear. Free water or ADH analogs may need to be used
to reduce the sodium concentration to levels dictated by correction
calculations.

DEFINITION: HYPERNATREMIA
Any increase in the serum sodium to >145 mmol/L automatically
increases hypertonicity, leading to intracellular dehydration.
Classification
Unlike hyponatremia, all cases of hypernatremia are true hyperosmolar
states.
Although the serum sodium is elevated, intravascular volume may be low
or high, depending on the etiology.
Epidemiology
97

The overall incidence of hypernatremia is significantly lower than
hyponatremia.
Hypernatremia has been reported in <2% of all admissions.3,11
Hospital-acquired hypernatremia has been reported to occur in 2% to 5%
of all admissions.3,11
Patients admitted with hypernatremia were more likely to be elderly,
whereas those with hospital-acquired hypernatremia had similar ages to
the general hospital population.3
Similar to hyponatremia, the presence of hypernatremia is also
associated with an increased risk of poor outcomes.3
Etiology
Urinary concentrating deficits:
Diuretics
Solute diuresis:
Mannitol infusion
Hyperglycemia
High protein feeding
Diabetes insipidus:
Central—decreased or absent ADH
Postpituitary surgery
Sarcoidosis
Pregnancy—placental production of vasopressinase28

98

Nephrogenic—renal resistance to ADH22,29
Lithium toxicity
Hypercalcemia
Hypokalemia
Cidofovir
Amphotericin B
Foscarnet
Post acute tubular necrosis
Amyloidosis
Sickle-cell disease
Congenital
Water losses:
Insensible
Enteral
Lack of free water intake
Pathophysiology
As the sodium concentration increases, increased cellular volume loss can
lead to rupture of cerebral blood vessels with associated morbidity and
mortality. Just as with hyponatremia, chronic development of
hypernatremia is better tolerated than an equivalent acute change.2
Cerebrospinal fluid movement into the interstitial areas of brain tissue,
as well as the increase in intracellular electrolyte and other effective
osmoles, initially serves to protect from the effects of hypernatremia.2
99

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms are primarily a re ection of CNS involvement, and include
lethargy, irritability, weakness, confusion, and progression to coma, but
they are generally not apparent until the sodium concentration has
increased to >160 mmol/L.2
History
A careful history should follow similar lines to those outlined in the
hyponatremia section.
Additional history should include a careful assessment of fluid intake and
output (including enteral).
Physical Examination
Similar to the patient with hyponatremia, a careful exam should assess
volume status.
Diagnostic Testing
Blood tests:
Renal function panel and plasma osmolarity
Urine tests:
Urine osmolarity, urine sodium, and urine potassium
Calculate CH20 (Eq. 2)
Imaging
Head CT, if the patient has neurologic symptoms

TREATMENT
100

Hypernatremia corrected too rapidly may have unintended
consequences; thus, the sodium concentration should be returned to the
normal range slowly and with vigilant lab and clinical monitoring.
Correction at a rate of 0.5 mmol/L/h has been shown to have a low
likelihood of complications.2 Faster correction rates can prevent adequate
time for intracellular adjustment of tonicity, leading to cellular swelling.
Severe volume depletion or hemodynamic instability merits treatment
with normal saline. Lesser degrees of clinical volume depletion can be
treated with 0.2% or 0.45% saline solution.
Once the volume status has been restored satisfactorily, D5W alone

should be used to correct hypernatremia. The dextrose component is
metabolized as long as insulin deficiency is not present, leaving free
water. Overwhelming the ability to metabolize dextrose is not a concern
with the low administration rates used in the slow correction of
hypernatremia.
For example, you are asked to see a patient in the intensive care unit
who has developed polyuria and hypernatremia. The patient has been
receiving high protein feeding. Urine output has been 5 L. Laboratory
results reveal serum sodium of 160 mmol/L, urine osmolality 1000
mOsm/kg, urine sodium 40 mmol/L, and urine potassium 40 mmol/L.
CH20 = 5 L × (1 − (40 + 40)/160) = 2.5 L
Therefore, the patient has lost 2.5 L of electrolyte-free water in the urine
from a solute diuresis in the setting of high protein intake (note the high
urine osmolality).
Example, an 80-year-old, 60 kg female is brought in from a nursing home
with lethargy and confusion. Exam is consistent with volume depletion.
Initial serum sodium is 160 mmol/L. The patient receives 2 L of normal
saline in the emergency room and admitted to the floor. Calculate how
much free water to give to correct sodium by 12 mmol/L (down to 148
mmol/L) over 24 hours.

101

Current TBW = 40% × 60 = 24 L.
Current (Na E + KE) = 24 L × 160 = 3840 mmol.
The new TBW to get sodium to 148 = 3840/148 = 26 L.
Therefore, patient should get 2 + 1 L (to replace insensible losses) = 3 L
of free water over 24 hours or 125 mL/h.
As with hyponatremia, calculations only provide a rough estimate to
help initiate therapy and do not replace frequent monitoring and
adjustment. Frequent assessment of urine output, volume status, and
laboratory data is essential. Failure to do so can once again lead to
undesired outcomes.

KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER
Abnormalities of plasma [Na +] actually reflect imbalances of water
homeostasis.
Effective plasma osmolarity must always be checked in hyponatremia.
Astute estimation of the volume state is key in making a correct
diagnosis.
Symptomatic sodium disorders need emergent therapy. All asymptomatic
cases require gradual and deliberate treatment with frequent monitoring
to avoid complications of overcorrection.
It is best to methodically define treatment goals, speed of correction, and
fluid type at the outset. One must be prepared to modify the plan
according to ongoing changes and follow-up laboratory values.

Disorders of Potassium Balance
Sadashiv Santosh

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Normal daily potassium (K+) intake is ∼80 mEq/d. Total body
potassium (K+) is ∼50 mEq/kg, 98% of which is intracellular.
Intracellular concentrations (∼140 mEq/L) are 35 times that normally
present in the extracellular (plasma) space (∼4 mEq/L); changes in
plasma [K+] may not reflect total body K+ stores.
Renal regulation of plasma potassium:
Aldosterone plays a central role in [K+] regulation by stimulating its
excretion in the cortical collecting duct of the nephron.1–3 Decreased
effective circulating volume (ECV) or an increase in plasma [K+] leads
to increased aldosterone production and increased potassium secretion in
exchange for sodium retention.
Hyperkalemia is also a direct stimulus for renal K+ secretion. Renal
secretion of K+ is dependent on adequate tubular flow in the distal
nephron. Decreased ECV leads not only to increased aldosterone
production (favoring K+ excretion) but also to decreased distal flow rate
(reducing K+ excretion), allowing plasma [K+] to remain in a relatively
stable state. Conversely, increased ECV leads to not only a decrease in
aldosterone production but also an increased distal flow rate, allowing
plasma [K+] to again remain normal.
Changes in plasma [K+] can occur due to shifting of K+ in or out of
cells, independent of changes in total body K+.

HYPOKALEMIA
106

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hypokalemia is defined as [K+] <3.5 mEq/L.
Pathophysiology
Hypokalemia may result from decreased intake, intracellular shift of K+,
or increased K+ losses (usually renal or gastrointestinal [GI]).
Decreased intake: In the setting of decreased intake, the normally
functioning kidney can decrease K+ excretion to <25 mEq/d. Thus,
moderate dietary K+ restriction should not by itself cause hypokalemia.3
Intracellular shift: A variety of factors can cause potassium to shift into
cells.
Alkalosis—if extracellular pH rises, H+ will be driven out of cells in
exchange for K+ shifting into cells.3
Stimulation of the Na/K-ATPase pump. This pump maintains the high
intracellular potassium concentrations and its activity can be increased
by catecholamines, particularly β2-adrenergic stimulation and insulin.4
The latter may also mediate hypokalemia often seen with refeeding
syndrome.5

Treatment of anemia or neutropenia with vitamin B12/folic acid or

granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can cause
hypokalemia because of increased uptake by hematopoietic cells.6,7
Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, a result of amputation of skeletal
muscle dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels,3 and thyrotoxic
periodic paralysis, mutation of a skeletal muscle K+ channel, cause K+
shifting into muscle cells.8
Hypothermia.
107

GI losses:
Normal fecal K+ excretion is ∼10 mEq/d. With normal dietary K+
intake, if fecal losses exceed ∼55 mEq/d, the kidney’s ability to conserve
K+ may be exceeded and K+ depletion will occur.
Large volume stool output of any cause, especially if coupled with
decreased oral intake, may cause hypokalemia.
Gastric secretions normally contain very little K+. In the case of
vomiting or large-volume nasogastric suction, hypokalemia may
occur, but this is NOT due to K+ loss in the gastric fluid. The proton
loss and volume contraction cause metabolic alkalosis (with elevated
plasma bicarbonate). Although intracellular shift of K+ from alkalemia
might be expected, the major contributor to hypokalemia is increased
distal nephron K+ secretion due to bicarbonaturia- and hypovolemiainduced aldosterone release, leading to K+ wasting.3
Renal losses:
Diuretics: Loop and thiazide diuretics induce hypokalemia by increasing
distal nephron fluid delivery as well as stimulating aldosterone secretion
by inducing hypovolemia.3,6 Bartter’s and Gitelman’s syndromes are lossof-function mutations in furosemide- and thiazide-sensitive channels,
respectively.9
Syndromes of mineralocorticoid excess:
Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome) due to adrenal
adenoma or hyperplasia
Secondary hyperaldosteronism due to renal artery stenosis,
fibromuscular dysplasia, renin-secreting tumor (rare)
Apparent mineralocorticoid excess
11β-Hydroxylase deficiency
Cortisol is a potent mineralocorticoid, but is inactivated in the kidney by
108

11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Licorice, which can be found in some
tobacco and chewing gum, can inactivate this enzyme
Cushing’s syndrome
Hypokalemia results from the excess production of steroids that are
normally metabolized by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme.
Liddle’s syndrome, a gain-of-function mutation of distal epithelial Na+
channels, increases sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and
enhances the excretion of potassium.
Glucocorticoid remediable hyperaldosteronism, caused by mutation
resulting in ACTH-sensitive aldosterone synthase gene. This results in
increased aldosterone production, remediable by suppressing ACTH
synthesis using glucorticoids.
Increased distal nephron flow from saline diuresis, salt-wasting
nephropathy, and glucosuria (diabetes mellitus or Fanconi’s syndrome).
Nonreabsorbable anion: The presence of a nonreabsorbable anion in
the distal nephron creates negative charge in the lumen, promoting K+
secretion. This phenomenon can be seen with bicarbonaturia (metabolic
alkalosis) and urinary hippurate (glue sniffing).
Tubular toxins: Amphotericin, gentamicin, hypercalcemia, and cisplatin
all cause tubular damage, impairing K+ reabsorption.
Hypomagnesemia: It can cause renal potassium wasting. Adequate
potassium retention often cannot take place until the magnesium deficit
is replaced. Hypomagnesemia is often associated with alcoholism,
diuretics, diarrhea, poor nutrition, aminoglycoside, and cisplatin use.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Mild hypokalemia (3.0 to 3.5 mEq/L) is generally asymptomatic,
although it does pose an increased risk of mortality for patients who also
have cardiovascular disease or who are on digitalis.
109

Weakness and muscle pain, usually initially involving the lower
extremities, can develop as the [K+] drops below 3 mEq/L.
Further decreases to below 2.5 mEq/L can lead to paralysis, including
involvement of the muscles of respiration. Some patients can present
with an ileus due to hypokalemic effects on smooth muscle.
Rhabdomyolysis can occur with severe hypokalemia. This elevates the
[K+] and prevents further decrements, but can also serve to mask the
underlying etiology. Checking serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level
may aid in the diagnosis of suspected hypokalemia-induced
rhabdomyolysis.
Hypokalemia can impair renal water reabsorption and cause a
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Prolonged hypokalemia can cause irreversible interstitial nephritis, renal
cysts, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Increased renal ammonia
synthesis occurs in the presence of hypokalemia and can potentially lead
to hepatic coma in an individual with advanced liver disease.10
History
The history should try to elicit common causes such as vomiting,
diarrhea, laxative abuse, and diuretic use. A family history of
hypokalemia may suggest Bartter’s, Gitelman’s, or Liddle’s syndrome. A
history of weakness after adrenergic stimuli, insulin, or highcarbohydrate meals suggests hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Concurrent
hyperthyroidism may represent thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.
Physical Examination
Physical exam findings should focus on signs of volume depletion
(volume contraction may lead to metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia)
or hypertension (suggesting mineralocorticoid excess).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
110

Urine potassium excretion: Random urine [K+] can be misleading. A
low value may falsely suggest extrarenal causes of K+ depletion if the
urine is very dilute. A 24-hour urine K+ is helpful but cumbersome.
Normally, daily K+ excretion should fall to <25 mEq/d in the setting of
hypokalemia. The transtubular K+ gradient (TTKG) is more easily
obtained than a 24-hour collection, and can be helpful.11 TTKG should be
<3 if the kidney is appropriately conserving K+, in which case
hypokalemia is likely being caused by GI or sweat losses, or prior diuretic
therapy.
TTGK = (urine [K+] × serum osmolality)/(serum [K+] × urine
osmolality)
If urine K+ excretion, determined as described above, is inappropriately
high and the cause is not obvious from history and physical exam, then
measuring plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels can be
helpful.
High renin: It usually indicates diuretic use, salt-wasting nephropathies,
GI volume losses, or renovascular disease. Rarely, renin-secreting tumors
may be the cause.
Low renin/high aldosterone: It indicates primary hyperaldosteronism
due either to adrenal adenoma or adrenal hyperplasia. Adrenal computed
tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful.12
Low renin/low aldosterone: It indicates increased nonaldosterone
mineralocorticoid effect, such as licorice ingestion.
It should be emphasized that assessment of urinary potassium and
renin/ aldosterone activity do not always differentiate between all
specific causes of hypokalemia. Therefore, the clinical history remains
important in pinpointing the cause.
Acid-base status: Hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis is usually due to
diuretics, vomiting, or mineralocorticoid excess. Hypokalemia with
metabolic acidosis is less common; types I and II renal tubular acidosis
(RTA), salt-wasting nephropathy, and diabetic ketoacidosis (especially
after insulin administration has caused intracellular shift of K+) are on
111

the differential diagnosis.
Magnesium: As described above, hypomagnesemia can cause urinary
K+ wasting; hence, it should be excluded as a cause of (often refractory)
hypokalemia.
Electrocardiography
EKG changes due to hypokalemia: Prominent U waves, diminished or
inverted T waves, and ST-segment depression are observed; with
extremely low [K+] levels, the PR and QRS intervals can lengthen and
lead to ventricular fibrillation. EKG changes do not correlate well with
the degree of hypokalemia.3,13

TREATMENT
The potassium deficit at plasma [K+] of 3 mEq/L may be in the range of
200 to 400 mEq. As the plasma level decreases to <3 mEq/L, the deficit
can be >600 mEq, but is unpredictable due to transcellular shifts. This is
classically seen in hyperglycemic states in which the combination of
hyperglycemia, glucosuria, ketonuria, and insulin treatment all affect the
[K+], and levels can change dramatically during the course of treatment.
Potassium replacement should be given PO whenever possible due
to the potential for cardiac arrhythmias, vein sclerosis, and the increased
cost in using intravenous (IV) administration.
Oral doses of 40 mEq of potassium are generally well tolerated and can
be given q4 hours.
Potassium chloride is usually administered, as the chloride component
helps correct the often-coinciding alkalosis and bicarbonaturia.
Potassium citrate can be given if hypokalemia associated with acidemia
is present.
IV potassium can be administered in concentrations of 40 mEq/L via a
peripheral line or 60 mEq/L via a central line.
112

The rate of infusion should generally not be >10 mEq/h unless
absolutely necessary.
Intravenous potassium should be administered in a saline solution rather
than with dextrose; insulin release in response to the dextrose can further
decrease the [K+].
Correction of metabolic alkalosis will help prevent renal K+
wasting that accompanies bicarbonaturia. In cases of vomiting, H2-

blockers or proton pump inhibitors can reduce the acidity of the gastric
secretions and prevent acid loss. In hypovolemic patients with a
contraction alkalosis, volume repletion can be accomplished with isotonic
IV fluids.
In the treatment of hypokalemia due to hyperaldosteronism or
diuretic use (e.g., for congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension),
potassium-sparing diuretics are useful.
Spironolactone, which reduces aldosterone synthesis, is commonly used
in patients with liver disease and ascites, as well as in patients with CHF.
Amiloride and triamterene block the apical Na+ channel in the distal
nephron. Amiloride is favored over triamterene because of a significant
risk of nephrolithiasis and potential renal insufficiency with the latter.14
In states of aldosterone excess, doses of 20 to 40 mg/d PO of amiloride
may be needed; otherwise, doses of 5 to 10 mg/d may suffice.
Amiloride is the treatment of choice for Liddle’s syndrome and Gitelman’s
syndrome.

HYPERKALEMIA
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hyperkalemia is defined as [K+] >5 mEq/L.
113

Pathophysiology
Acute hyperkalemia may result from various causes, typically
reflecting transcellular shifting of potassium.
Pseudohyperkalemia: It is characterized by release of potassium from
cellular elements (white blood cells, platelets, hemolyzed red blood cells
(RBCs)) after sample collection. Repeated fist clenching or prolonged
tourniquet application during phlebotomy can also cause spurious
elevations in [K+].15
Very large oral or intravenous K+ loads: With normally functioning
homeostatic mechanisms, oral K+ loads of up to 135 to 160 mEq are
reasonably well tolerated, producing rises in plasma K+ of <3.5 mEq/L.
Potassium release from RBCs after transfusion can result in
hyperkalemia,16 which can be prevented by washing the RBCs.17 Citrate
anti-coagulant used in RBC storage can cause concurrent hypocalcemia,
increasing the potential for arrhythmia.
Decreased cellular uptake due to insulin deficiency or nonselective
beta-blockade. Digitalis toxicity also impairs Na+/K+ ATPase activity
(e.g., due to digitalis toxicity).
Extracellular K+ release: It is caused by trauma, tissue necrosis,
rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, severe exercise,18,19 depolarizing
neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine).20
Metabolic acidosis not due to organic acids. Metabolic acidosis due to
organic acids (e.g., ketoacids and lactic acid) usually do NOT cause
hyperkalemia. The extracellular K+ shift seen in, for example, diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA) and the nonketotic hyperosmolar state, is thought to
be due to hyperosmolality from hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency and
not metabolic acidosis.21
Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (due in some cases to a mutation in
the skeletal muscle Na+ channel).
Chronic hyperkalemia implies decreased renal K+ excretion, due
114

usually to decreased aldosterone effect or decreased flow in the distal
nephron. In chronic kidney disease, decreased nephron mass is
compensated for by increased K+ secretion per nephron.
Decreased aldosterone effect:
Decreased synthesis of aldosterone.
Medications that disrupt the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis
(angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor
blockers, and renin inhibitors) decrease the synthesis of aldosterone.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and heparin, including lowmolecular-weight heparin,22 are also known to reduce aldosterone
synthesis.
A variety of medical conditions decrease aldosterone production. These
include:
Adrenal insufficiency (acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and
Addison’s disease)
Diabetes mellitus
Type II pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) (Gordon’s syndrome/chloride
shunt)23
Aldosterone resistance:
Medications such as aldosterone antagonists (amiloride, triamterene,
spironolactone, epleronone, and trimethoprim) and cyclosporine24
decrease the response to aldosterone.
Type I PHA is caused by loss-of-function mutation of either the
mineralocorticoid receptor (renal PHA type I) or in the amiloridesensitive epithelial Na+ channel (multiple target organ defect PHA type
I).23
Type IV RTA is a term used to describe the nonanion gap metabolic
acidosis and hyperkalemia that occur in the setting of decreased
115

aldosterone effect.
Decreased distal flow.
A marked reduction in distal flow can be seen with severe volume
contraction, poor ECVs, or intense vasoconstriction, as seen in CHF,
cirrhosis, renal artery stenosis, and hypovolemia. Ordinarily, volume
contraction stimulates the secretion of aldosterone and enhances K+
secretion. However, this homeostatic mechanism can be overwhelmed
with severe reductions in distal flow and/or concurrent predisposition
toward hyperkalemia (from medications such as ACE inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers, or aldosterone antagonists, for example).

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The two principal clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia are muscle
weakness and cardiac conduction disturbances. Hyperkalemia raises
the resting membrane potential of muscle cells. Although muscle
contraction is normally associated with membrane depolarization,
persistent elevation of membrane potential inactivates Na+ channels,
resulting in muscle weakness.
History
In hyperkalemia, the first step is to confirm true hyperkalemia by
checking whole-blood [K+] and assessing the EKG for conduction
abnormalities that warrant immediate treatment (see below). Once the
patient is out of danger, evaluation of the underlying cause can be
undertaken.
Review of medications and medical history often make the diagnosis.
Diabetes mellitus may suggest hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism
(HRHA), and chronic kidney disease implies limited ability to excrete
K+. A dietary history of high K+ foods (bananas, tomatoes, potatoes,
oranges, melons, avocados, meats, kiwis, milk, spinach, apricots, lima
beans, papayas, cucumber) or K+-containing salt substitutes should be
116

sought. History of trauma may indicate rhabdomyolysis (elevated CPK).
Recent chemotherapy should raise the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome
(hyperphosphatemia hyperuricemia). If the cause of hyperkalemia is still
not obvious, then an evaluation of urinary potassium excretion should
follow.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Pseudohyperkalemia should be ruled out by checking whole-blood
[K+].
TTKG: As with hypokalemia, spot measurements of urine K+ may be
misleading. Therefore, TTKG should be checked.
Normal renal response to hyperkalemia is to raise TTKG to >10.
A TTKG <7 suggests decreased aldosterone effect. Two caveats for a
valid TTKG assessment are that the urine osmolality should be greater
than the plasma osmolality (to ensure that water is being reabsorbed in
the collecting duct) and that the urine sodium is >25 mEq/L (to ensure
that potassium excretion is not limited by decreased sodium delivery).
The causes of decreased aldosterone effect are described above.
If the TTKG suggests hypoaldosteronism and the clinical presentation
does not reveal an obvious etiology, plasma renin activity, aldosterone,
and cortisol levels can be obtained from a morning sample after the
patient has been ambulating for ≥3 hours or after the administration of
furosemide the previous evening and again in the morning.

117

Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism presents with low/low-to-normal
renin and low aldosterone levels.
In primary adrenal insufficiency, renin is high but aldosterone and
cortisol levels are low.
In pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (aldosterone resistance) and
pharmacologic aldosterone receptor blockade (e.g., amiloride and
triamterene), renin and aldosterone levels are high (see Table 7-1).
Acid-base status: Nonanion gap acidosis along with low urine pH is
often seen along with decreased aldosterone effect (type IV RTA).
Hyperkalemic variant of type I RTA also presents with nongap acidosis,
but in this disorder the urine pH will be high.
Electrocardiography
EKG changes classically involve increased amplitude and narrowing of
the T wave and shortening of the QT interval at [K+] levels >6 mEq/L.
As [K+] increases further to >7 to 8 mEq/L, the PR interval increases,
and loss of the P wave can occur along with widening of the QRS. This
sine-wave pattern can degenerate rapidly to ventricular fibrillation or
asystole if untreated. The level at which neuromuscular symptoms or EKG
changes occur in a particular patient is highly variable. Chronic
hyperkalemia is more likely to present with normal EKG. In addition, the
presence of other abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia or hyponatremia,
amplifies the effects of hyperkalemia on cardiac conduction.

118

TREATMENT
As described previously, the treatment of hyperkalemia must be initiated
in the context of the [K+], and the presence or absence of neuromuscular
symptoms and electrocardiography changes.
A significant elevation in the absence of symptoms or EKG changes may
be due to pseudohyperkalemia (which should be ruled out by checking
whole-blood K+) or chronic hyperkalemia (in which cellular adaptation
has taken place).
Correction of contributing factors such as acidemia, hypocalcemia, and
hyponatremia decreases the hyperkalemic effects on the cell membrane.
Other modalities involve stabilizing the cell membrane with calcium,
driving potassium into the cells, and, ultimately, removing excess
potassium.
Methods to stabilize the cell membrane or move potassium inside
the cell are only temporizing measures, and potassium needs to be
removed to resolve the total body excess.
Calcium IV is the first treatment in severe hyperkalemia, because it
stabilizes the myocardial membrane.
Calcium chloride contains 13.6 mEq (272 mg) of elemental calcium per
gram, whereas calcium gluconate contains 4.7 mEq (93 mg) per gram.
Therefore, 1 g of calcium chloride may be sufficient, but if calcium
gluconate is given, 2 g may be required.
119

If extravasation occurs, calcium can cause tissue necrosis; administration
through a central venous line is preferred to peripheral IV, especially
with calcium chloride. Each gram of calcium should be given slowly (over
5 to 10 minutes).
Insulin rapidly (within minutes) lowers serum [K+] by causing
intracellular shift, and the effect can last up to a few hours.4,25,26
It is usually given as a dose of 10 units of regular insulin IV along with
25 to 50 g of dextrose (1 to 2 ampules of 50% dextrose).
A peak reduction in serum [K+] of 1 to 1.5 mEq/L can be expected.
If the patient already has hyperglycemia, insulin can be given alone.
Patients who are normoglycemic may become hypoglycemic when 10
units of regular insulin is administered with only 25 g of dextrose.
If glucose alone is given to nondiabetic patients, endogenous secretion of
insulin will lower serum [K+]. However, in insulin-dependent diabetics,
glucose alone can produce hyperkalemia due to increased serum
osmolality.27
β2-Adrenergic agents have a similar effect on intracellular transport of
potassium.25
Albuterol is classically given in a dose of 5 to 20 mg by nebulizer or
0.5 mg IV. With IV administration, the onset of action is similar to
insulin, but the effect is slightly delayed when given by nebulizer.
The magnitude and duration of effect is similar to that of insulin
administration.
Owing to the risk of precipitating coronary events secondary to betaagonist–induced tachycardia, alternate agents are preferred in patients
with known or suspected hyperkalemia.
Renal elimination is preferred when possible and is often the only
measure necessary for mild to moderate hyperkalemia.
120

Increasing delivery of sodium and poorly reabsorbed anions (e.g.,
bicarbonate) will increase K+ excretion; this can be accomplished by
sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate (see below), or diuretic (especially
loop diuretic) administration.
The patient with hyperkalemia and volume depletion may respond
readily to fluid administration alone.
The euvolemic patient may be treated with simultaneous saline and loop
diuretics.
The volume overloaded patient may respond to diuresis alone.
Patients with PHA type II respond dramatically to thiazide diuretics.
Sodium bicarbonate, although raising extracellular pH, causes K+ to
shift into cells; the primary mechanism by which bicarbonate lowers
serum [K+] is through stimulating renal excretion.25,28
As a treatment for hyperkalemia, bicarbonate should be used with
caution, after correction of hypocalcemia.29
It is administered as 50 mEq (one ampule) IV for several minutes.
Administration is often limited by the complications of sodium loading in
patients with CHF or chronic kidney disease, which can be followed by a
continuous IV infusion.
Cation-exchange resins like sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS,
Kayexalate) are used to eliminate excess potassium by exchanging
potassium for sodium in the GI tract.
They can be given orally or rectally.
Although the rectal preparation has a faster onset of action than the oral
preparation, the oral route is preferable, given recent reports of
intestinal necrosis, particularly in patients with recent abdominal
surgery, bowel injury, or intestinal dysfunction.30
The normal dose is 15 g PO q6 h or 30 to 50 g PR, as needed. Each gram
121

removes up to 1 mEq of potassium. In exchange, 1 to 2 mEq of sodium is
absorbed.
There is no role for these agents in patients with impending dialysis
treatments as it will cause them to have loose bowel movements during
their treatment.
Dialysis: If hyperkalemia is severe, especially when renal and GI routes
of elimination are not feasible, dialysis can be life saving.
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can lower [K+] as well, but not nearly as
rapidly as hemodialysis (HD).
If PD is chosen, several rapid exchanges (∼60- to 70-minutes dwell time
per exchange) may be performed conveniently using a cycler.
In a patient with plasma [K+] of 6.0 mEq, four rapid exchanges can be
expected to remove a total of ∼25 to 30 mEq of K+ (similar to two doses
of SPS), which may be enough to get the patient out of danger.31
In more severe hyperkalemia or clinical conditions in which continued
K+ influx into plasma is expected (i.e., tissue necrosis), HD may be
necessary.
If HD is used, a dialysate [K+] of 2 mEq/L is often sufficient.
In severe hyperkalemia, dialysate [K+] of 1 mEq/L may be used for the
first 30 to 60 min, with close monitoring of whole-blood [K+].
If one anticipates HD will be started in a timely manner, IV calcium may
be the only treatment necessary; treatment with insulin and beta agonist
will only reduce the efficacy of HD by driving K+ into cells, where it
cannot be removed by the dialyzer.
Similarly, use of SPS should be avoided prior to anticipated HD; SPS
takes several hours to work and will only cause the patient to have
diarrhea while on dialysis.
It is important to remember that immediate post-HD plasma [K+]
122

represents a nadir, and intracellular K+ will subsequently shift to the
extracellular space (called “rebound”). Thus, potassium repletion for a
serum [K+] that appears to have overcorrected after dialysis is seldom
appropriate.
Chronic hyperkalemia is often associated with diabetic-associated HRHA,
renal failure, or CHF. The serum potassium in this setting is usually stable
and ≤6 mEq/L. Many of these patients are appropriately maintained on
medications to treat the underlying condition(s), such as ACE inhibitors
or spironolactone. Not infrequently these medications are discontinued
due to mild elevations in the [K+]. In almost all cases, a moderate
reduction in potassium intake, the use of diuretics as indicated, and a
tolerance for stable mild to moderate hyperkalemia allows successful
continuation.

Disorders of Calcium Metabolism
Yekaterina Gincherman

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The average diet contains 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium, mainly from dairy
products.
Approximately 20% to 40% is absorbed in the small intestine, whereas
the remaining calcium is excreted in the stool along with a small
additional amount from colonic secretions.
Maintenance of calcium balance involves buffering in the skeletal system
and tightly controlled excretion in the kidneys, as seen in
Figure 8-1.
In the kidney, 80% to 85% of the calcium load is reabsorbed along
the proximal nephron. In the ascending loop of Henle, calcium
is reabsorbed passively through the tight junction protein, paracellin-1.
Although a smaller percentage is reabsorbed in the distal tubule, distal
calcium reabsorption is actively regulated by the actions of parathyroid
hormone (PTH).1
A total of 99% of elemental calcium is found in the bone, complexed as
hydroxyapatite crystals. A measure of <1% of total body calcium
remains in the extracellular fluid (ECF).
In the ECF, 50% of calcium is in the ionized state, 40% is bound to
albumin (and thus not filterable at the kidney), and 10% is bound to
anions like citrate, sulfate, and phosphate as a filterable complex. The
normal calcium range is 8.6 to 10.3 mg/dL. The ionized fraction is
physiologically active and therefore tightly regulated in a narrow range
127

(4.5 to 5.1 mg/dL) by the following mechanisms:
PTH:
The parathyroid gland senses the ECF-ionized calcium concentration via
a calcium-sensing receptor. High levels of ECF calcium stimulate the
receptor and cause a transient rise in intracellular calcium concentration
that inhibits the release of PTH. Low concentrations of ECF calcium
stimulate PTH production and secretion.
In the kidney, PTH enhances tubular reabsorption of calcium, decreases
proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphate, and stimulates the
generation of calcitriol in the proximal tubule.
By promoting calcitriol synthesis, PTH has an indirect effect of
increasing gut absorption of calcium and phosphorus.
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin present in diet and produced in the
skin in the presence of ultraviolet light. 25-Hydroxylase in the liver forms
calcidiol.2

FIGURE 8-1. Daily calcium fluxes in a healthy adult in zero mineral
ion balance. Values are expressed in mg/day. ECF, extracellular
fluid.
Calcitriol is formed in the proximal tubule from 1-α hydroxylation of
calcidiol. It can also be formed in activated macrophages and a
128

population of lymphocytes derived from thymus.
The main role of calcitriol is to improve the availability of calcium and
phosphate.
In the intestine and kidney, calcitriol stimulates calcium absorption.
In the bone, calcitriol complements the actions of PTH, stimulating
osteoclastic bone resorption.
Calcitriol acts directly on the parathyroid gland to inhibit both PTH
synthesis and secretion.
Calcitriol is inactived by 24-hydroxylase. Activity of this enzyme is
increased by calcitriol and decreased by PTH.

HYPERCALCEMIA
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pathophysiology
Clinically significant hypercalcemia is invariably caused by both an
increase in entry of calcium into the ECF from bone resorption or
intestinal absorption and a decrease in renal clearance of calcium.
Primary hyperparathyroidism (>50%) and malignancy (∼40%) account
for the majority (>90%) of cases (Table 8-1).3
Increased bone resorption:
Primary hyperparathyroidism (sporadic, familial, MEN1, MEN2,
lithium therapy) is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in
ambulatory patients.
An adenoma of a single gland is found in 85% of cases and 15% of cases
are due to hyperplasia of all four glands.

129

Parathyroid carcinoma is responsible for <1% of the cases.
Most patients are asymptomatic, and hypercalcemia, which is usually
modest, is discovered incidentally.
These patients remain at risk for long-term consequences of
hyperparathyroidism such as nephrolithiasis and osteopenia.
Malignancy is responsible for most cases of hypercalcemia among
hospitalized patients. There are three mechanisms of malignant
hypercalcemia:
Osteolytic hypercalcemia is caused by cytokines produced by the tumor
cells that act locally to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption.
This form of malignant hypercalcemia is responsible for the majority of
malignancy-associated cases.
It occurs only with extensive bone involvement by tumor, most often due
to breast carcinoma, non–small-cell lung cancer, myeloma, and
lymphoma.
130

Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy results from tumor products
acting systemically to stimulate bone resorption and decrease renal
calcium excretion.
PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) is an important mediator of this
syndrome.
Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is caused most often by squamous
carcinoma of the lung, head and neck, or esophagus, or by renal, bladder,
or ovarian carcinoma.
Tumoral calcitriol production may occasionally occur in Hodgkin’s
and nonHodgkin’s lymphomas.
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism: Long-term dialysis patients may
develop parathyroid hyperplasia and an autonomous secretion of PTH.
Persistent PTH secretion after a successful transplant may lead to
hypercalcemia.4 This is usually mild and tends to decrease over 6 to 12
months.
The use of calcimimetics in end-stage renal disease patients has been
associated with parathyroid hyperplasia, predisposing transplant patients
to hypercalcemia after transplant, which can often be severe.
Immobilization: Sustained bed rest leads to an increase in bone
resorption and may lead to hypercalcemia.
This is usually seen in patients with spinal cord injuries, those in full
body casts, or in intensive care unit setting.
Mobilization corrects hypercalcemia.
Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is an autosomaldominant disorder in which mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor
causes decreased receptor activity.
Patients have a mild hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and normal or
mildly elevated PTH levels.
131

FHH can be differentiated from primary hyperparathyroidism by the
reduction in urinary calcium excretion.
Parathyroidectomy is not indicated.
Thyrotoxicosis may stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption, causing a
mild hypercalcemia. Concurrent hyperparathyroidism can also occur.
Vitamin A intoxication (doses >50,000 IU/d) can be associated with
hypercalcemia secondary to increased osteoclast bone resorption.
Increased intestinal absorption: This is a less frequent cause of
hypercalcemia, but assumes greater importance in the setting of chronic
renal failure.
Milk-alkali syndrome: Ingestion of large quantities of calciumcarbonate-based antacids can lead to this condition, characterized by
hypercalcemia, alkalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure.
Granulomatous disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and leprosy cause
hypercalcemia because of the conversion of calcidiol to calcitriol by the 1α hydroxylase present in macrophages contained in the granulomas.
Treatment of the underlying disease corrects the hypercalcemia.
Vitamin D intoxication: It may be observed in dialysis patients
overtreated with vitamin D analogs. Hypercalcemia is usually mild and
improves with dose adjustment or discontinuation of the drug.
Decreased renal excretion:
Acute renal failure
Volume depletion
Thiazide diuretics can be associated with a mild hypercalcemia likely due
to increased proximal reabsorption from volume contraction.

DIAGNOSIS
132

Clinical Presentation
Mild hypercalcemia is often asymptomatic and incidentally discovered on
routine blood tests. Long-term manifestations include osteoporosis,
nephrolithiasis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Severe hypercalcemia is often associated with neurologic and
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.
GI symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.
Neurologic symptoms include weakness, fatigue, confusion, stupor, and
coma.
Renal manifestations include polyuria and nephrolithiasis. Polyuria
combined with nausea and vomiting can cause volume depletion,
resulting in impaired calcium excretion and worsening of hypercalcemia.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Calcium should be interpreted in the context of the plasma albumin
concentration (corrected calcium) or ionized calcium should be measured.
Phosphorus may be low in settings of elevated PTH (primary
hyperparathyroidism) or PTHrP (e.g., humoral hypercalcemia of
malignancy). Phosphorus may be high in vitamin D toxicity or increased
bone resorption without hyperparathyroidism (Paget disease).
Intact PTH levels are elevated or inappropriately normal in primary
hyperparathyroidism. PTH is almost always suppressed in patients with
hypercalcemia because of other causes, except FHH, tertiary
hyperparathyroidism, and lithium use.
PTHrP can be measured to confirm the diagnosis of humoral
hypercalcemia of malignancy.
1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) levels are elevated in granulomatous disorders
133

and calcitriol overdose.
25(OH)D levels are elevated with noncalcitriol vitamin D intoxication
(rare).
Urinary calcium: Patients with FHH can be distinguished from primary
hyperparathyroidism by low urinary calcium concentrations (<200 mg
calcium per 24 hours or fractional excretion of calcium <1%).

TREATMENT
Volume repletion:
Correction of hypovolemia is the initial goal and often requires at
least 3 to 4 L of 0.9% saline in the first 24 hours.
Continuing maintenance IV fluids after restoring ECF volume promotes
further calcium excretion.
Electrolyte concentrations should be monitored every 8 to 12 hours
during induction and maintenance of diuresis.
Diuretics: Although loop diuretics impair tubular reabsorption of
calcium, they are generally not used for acute hypercalcemia as they may
result in further volume depletion. They are useful, however, if evidence
of volume overload develops. Thiazide diuretics should be avoided as they
enhance calcium reabsorption by the kidney.
Bisphosphonates: Intravenous bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption
and should be administered early because their effect is delayed.
Pamidronate, 60 to 90 mg, is infused over 2 to 4 hours.
A hypocalcemic response is seen within 2 days, peaks at 7 days, and may
persist for ≥2 weeks.
Treatment can be repeated after 7 days if hypercalcemia recurs.
Zoledronate is a more potent bisphosphonate that is given as a 4 mg
134

dose infused over at least 15 minutes.
During treatment with bisphosphonates, renal dysfunction can occur
from the precipitation of calcium bisphosphonate. Hydration should
precede their use, and renal insufficiency is a relative contraindication.
Side effects include hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia,
and renal dysfunction.
Calcitonin: Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption and increases renal
calcium excretion. As a treatment for acute hypercalcemia, it can be
dosed as follows:
Salmon calcitonin, 4 to 8 IU/kg IM or SC, q6h to q12h, lowers plasma
calcium by 1 to 2 mg/dL within several hours in 60% to 70% of patients.
The hypocalcemic effect wanes after several days because of
tachyphylaxis.
Calcitonin is less potent than other inhibitors of bone resorption, but has
no serious toxicity, is safe in renal failure, and may have an analgesic
effect in patients with skeletal metastases.5
It can be used early in the treatment of severe hypercalcemia to achieve
a rapid response.
Side effects include flushing, nausea, and, rarely, allergic reactions.
Glucocorticoids lower calcium concentrations by
inhibiting cytokine release
direct cytolytic effects on some tumor cells
inhibiting intestinal calcium absorption
increasing urinary calcium excretion
They are effective in hypercalcemia due to hematologic malignancies
135

including myeloma, tumoral or granulomatous production of calcitriol,
and vitamins D and A intoxication.
The initial dose is 20 to 60 mg/d of prednisone. Plasma calcium
concentration may take 5 to 10 days to fall. After plasma calcium
stabilizes, the dose should be gradually reduced to the minimum needed
to control symptoms of hypercalcemia.
Gallium nitrate: It inhibits bone resorption as effectively as the IV
bisphosphonates and has a similar delayed onset of 2 days.
It is given as a 100 to 200 mg/m2/d continuous infusion for up to 5 days,
unless normocalcemia is achieved sooner.
There is a significant risk of nephrotoxicity and it is contraindicated if
the plasma createnine is >2.5 mg/dL.
Dialysis: Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis using dialysate
with low calcium are very effective means of treating hypercalcemia.
Very low calcium dialysis baths should be used with caution as rapid
development of hypocalcemia can occur.
Parathyrodectomy in cases of hyperparathyroidism is indicated if the
following criteria are met.6
(a) Corrected plasma calcium >1 mg/dL above upper limit of normal
(b) Hypercalciuria >400 mg/d
(c) Renal insufficiency
(d) Reduced bone mass (T-score <–2.5 by DEXA)
(e) Age <50 years
(f) Nephrolithiasis
(g) Lack of feasibility of long-term follow-up

136

HYPOCALCEMIA
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pathophysiology
Hypocalcemia can result from either decreased calcium absorption from
the GI tract or decreased calcium resorption from bone.
Decreased calcium absorption:
Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D (calcidiol) deficiency is a very
common problem. Limited exposure to sunlight is the leading cause.
Nutritional deficiency of vitamin D can lead to rickets and osteomalacia.
As vitamin D is fat soluble, the deficiency can be seen in malabsorption
syndromes.
Anticonvulsants can result in vitamin D deficiency by stimulating the
hepatic metabolism of calcidiol.
CKD: The loss of renal functional mass and reduced activity of
1-α hydroxylase from phosphorus retention both contribute to the
decreased renal conversion of calcidiol (25(OH)D) to calcitriol
(1,25(OH)2D3). With decreasing levels of calcitriol, patients with

CKD are prone to develop hypocalcemia. However, the balance is partly
maintained by increasing levels of PTH as glomerular filteration rate
declines.
Vitamin D-dependent rickets: This condition is the result of either
impaired hydroxylation of calcidiol to calcitriol (type I) or end-organ
resistance to calcitriol (type II).
Type I patients respond to physiologic doses of calcitriol.
Patients with type II disease have mutations in the vitamin D receptor.
They tend to have dramatically increased concentrations of calcitriol and
137

respond poorly to calcitriol therapy.
Decreased PTH level or effect:
Hypoparathyroidism can be associated with acquired and inherited
diseases that result from either impaired synthesis or release of PTH.
The most common cause is polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I,
associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and primary adrenal
insufficiency.
Occasionally, pernicious anemia, diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, and
autoimmune thyroid disease are also associated with
hypoparathyroidism.
Hypoparathyroidism may be iatrogenic after thyroidectomy.
It can also occur secondary to radiation, infiltrative disorders, or
deposition of metals such as iron, copper, or aluminum.
Hypomagnesemia: Severe magnesium deficiency results in decreased
PTH secretion from the gland.7 Patients with hypocalcemia due to
hypomagnesemia do not respond to calcium or vitamin D replacement
until the magnesium deficit has been replaced.
Familial hypocalcemia results from activating mutations in the
calcium-sensing receptor. Subsequent downregulation of PTH
transcription leads to hypocalcemia from inappropriately low PTH levels
due to receptor malfunction.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism (Albright hereditary osteodystrophy) is a
hereditary disorder in which the target cell response to PTH is decreased.
Renal calcium excretion is increased and the PTH level is increased.
Phenotypic characteristics include short stature, obesity, shortened
metacarpals and metatarsals, and heterotopic calcification.
Calcimimetics have been used for the control of elevated PTH levels in
patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. In one study, 81% of
patients treated with these agents experienced hypocalcemia induced by
138

calcimimetics.8
Extravascular deposition/intravascular chelation:
Less commonly, hypocalcemia occurs as a result of either extravascular
deposition or intravascular chelation of calcium (Table 8-2).
Hungry bone syndrome: A profound reduction in calcium concentration
can occur after surgical removal of parathyroid.
This “hungry bone syndrome” is due to a rapid bone mineralization in
the absence of PTH.
Symptoms can occur soon after surgery, and patients’ calcium levels
should be carefully monitored (q4h to q6h).

Hungry bone syndrome has also been described after the administration
of calcimimetics for secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis
139

patients.9,10
Hypocalcemia also occurs after thyroid surgery (5% of cases).
Hyperphosphatemia: High concentrations of phosphorus form
complexes with extracellular calcium, resulting in hypocalcemia.
This phenomenon can occur during rapid release of intracellular
phosphorus, as seen in rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS).
Iatrogenic causes of this can occur during the administration of
intravenous phosphorus or phosphorus-containing enemas.
Acute pancreatitis: The release of pancreatic lipase digests
retroperitoneal and omental fat. The fatty acids, once released, bind to
the calcium. The hypocalcemia is aggravated by the hypoalbuminuria and
hypomagnesemia associated with acute pancreatitis.
Citrate-containing blood products: Massive transfusions of citratecontaining blood products can cause intravascular chelation of calcium,
leading to hypocalcemia.11 The use of citrate in continuous renal
replacement therapy or plasma exchange can also cause this.12
Gadolinium-based contrast agents: Gadodiamide and
gadoversetamide may interfere with assays for serum calcium, and
unexpected hypocalcia detected immediately after the administration of
these agents should be rechecked before action is taken.13
Septic shock: Endotoxic shock has been associated with hypocalcemia
through unclear mechanisms. Hypocalcemia may be partially responsible
for the hypotension, as myocardial function correlates with ionized
calcium levels.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms depend not only on the degree of hypocalcemia but also on
140

the rate of decline of the plasma calcium concentration.
Precipitation of symptoms is also influenced by plasma pH and the
presence or absence of concomitant hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, or
hyponatremia.
Neuromuscular excitability symptoms are the most common ones.
The patient may experience circumoral and distal extremity paresthesias
or carpopedal spasm.
Other manifestations include mental status changes, irritability, and
seizures.
Physical Examination
On physical exam, hypotension, bradycardia, laryngeal spasm, and
bronchospasm may be present.
Neurologic exam is significant for latent tetany, elicited as classical
Chvostek’s (facial twitch elicited by tapping on the facial nerve just
below the zygomatic arch with the mouth slightly open) and Trousseau’s
sign (development of wrist flexion, metacarpophalangeal joint flexion,
hyperextended fingers, and thumb flexion after a blood pressure cuff has
been inflated to 20 mm Hg above systolic pressure for a duration of 3
minutes).
Cardiovascular effects include hypotension, prolonged QT interval, and
impaired excitation contraction coupling, leading to congestive heart
failure.
Long-standing hypocalcemia can also be associated with subcapsular
cataracts.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Total calcium concentration should be corrected to the serum
141

albumin.
Decreased total plasma calcium concentration is found in
hypoalbuminemia without changes in the ionized calcium level. In
general, for every 1.0 g/dL decrement in plasma albumin, there is a 0.8
mg/dL decline in the reported total plasma calcium level.
Magnesium deficiency should be ruled out.
Phosphorus will be low in conditions associated with low vitamin D
activity, except for kidney failure, where there is decreased renal
clearance of phosphorus. The plasma phosphorus will be increased in
rhabdomyolysis
or TLS.
PTH that is low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypocalcemia
is indicative of hypoparathyroidism. A high PTH is often found with
vitamin D deficiency states, CKD, and pseudohypoparathyroidism.
25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels are useful in assessing for vitamin D
deficiency and vitamin D-dependent rickets, respectively.

TREATMENT
In symptomatic hypocalcemia or if corrected calcium concentration of
<7.5 mg/
dL IV calcium gluconate should be administered (100 to 300 mg, or 1 to
3 mL of 10% calcium gluconate solution, over 10 to 15 minutes), the first
ampule can be administered over several minutes followed by a constant
infusion at a rate of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/h.
Adjustments in the rate should be based on serial plasma calcium
determinations.
Treatment of hypocalcemia is ineffective without adequate treatment of
hypomagnesemia.
In the setting of metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia should be corrected
142

before the acidosis.
Mild hypocalcemia can be treated with oral calcium supplements with
or without vitamin D. Elemental calcium, 1 to 3 g/d can be given and is
best absorbed when taken between meals.
Patients with hypoparathyroidism generally need both calcium and
vitamin D supplementation.
Calcitriol is one of the most potent of the vitamin D preparations and
has the fastest onset and shortest duration of action.
A dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/d is usually required in patients with
hypoparathyroidism.
Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are less potent but inexpensive.
In cases of hypoparathyroidism, there is decreased distal tubular calcium
reabsorption as a result of a lack of PTH. The increase in the filtered load
of
calcium that results from calcium and vitamin D replacement therapy can
lead to hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocalcinosis.
If urinary calcium excretion exceeds 350 mg/d, despite plasma calcium
concentration in the low-to-normal range, sodium intake should be
restricted; if this is not effective, a thiazide diuretic should be added.

Disorders of Phosphorus
Metabolism
Yekaterina Gincherman

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The average diet contains 1000 to 1400 mg of phosphorus, mainly from
meat, cereals, and dairy products. Of this, up to 85% is absorbed in the
small ​intestine.1
The remainder is lost in the stool, with an additional 200 mg/d that is
secreted into the colon.
The vast majority of the body’s phosphorus content is stored in the
skeletal framework. Of the 700 g of phosphorus found in the average
individual, 85% of it is in the skeleton and 15% in soft tissues.
Extracellular fluid (ECF) ​contains <1% of total body phosphorus.2
Even in skeletal stores, the phosphorus pool is not stagnant. There is a
dynamic capture and release of phosphorus that allows regulation of the
serum phosphorus levels.
The kidney plays a central role in phosphorus balance and excretion.
Between 80% and 95% of filtered phosphate is reabsorbed primarily in
the proximal tubule.3
Plasma phosphorus levels are regulated by a number of mechanisms that
control the skeletal stores of phosphorus as well as renal handling of
phosphorus. Of central importance are:
Parathyroid hormone (PTH): The major role of PTH is to preserve
constant serum calcium concentration.
145

At the level of proximal tubule, PTH acts on receptors at apical and
basolateral sodium-phosphorus cotransporters to promote phosphorus
wasting.
PTH also acts directly on bone to increase phosphate entry into the ECF
and indirectly on the intestine by stimulating the synthesis of calcitriol.
Vitamin D increases plasma phosphate because of enhanced intestinal
phosphorus absorption by increasing sodium-phosphate cotransport
across the apical bush border membrane.
Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23): This molecule belongs to a
group of substances called phosphatonins. Their main effect is to promote
renal ​excretion of phosphate and lower plasma phosphorus levels.
In contrast to PTH, FGF-23 also leads to decreased production of
calcitriol and, therefore, has a net effect of reducing plasma phosphorus
concentration.4
The reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in kidney disease,
which leads to subsequent phosphorus retention, is a potent stimulus for
FGF-23 release.5
Insulin stimulates an intracellular shift in plasma phosphate, thus
lowering the plasma phosphorus concentrations.

HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hyperphosphatemia is defined by a plasma phosphorus concentration
that exceeds the normal range of 2.3 to 4.3 mg/dL.
Although the condition is defined by values outside the normal reference
range, some studies suggest that higher phosphorus levels, even within
the normal range, may predispose to vascular disease.6,7
146

Pathophysiology
The three main mechanisms that lead to hyperphosphatemia are
impaired renal excretion, transcellular shift into the ECF, and increased
phosphate intake (Table 9-1).
Impaired renal excretion:
Renal failure:
With declining GFR, the fractional excretion of phosphate begins to
increase and reabsorption is suppressed. Once GFR reaches around
≤25 mL/min, it can no longer keep up with the dietary intake and the
plasma phosphorus level begins to rise. Hence, hyperphosphatemia is a
frequent finding in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Decreased PTH effect:
Because PTH decreases proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphate,
deficiency of this hormone (hypoparathyroidism) or a resistance to its
actions (pseudohypoparathyroidism) leads to increased tubular transport
of phosphate, resulting in hyperphosphatemia.
Direct stimulation of proximal tubule reabsorption:
Conditions such as acromegaly, tumoral calcinosis, and the
administration of bisphosphonates are known to directly stimulate renal
phosphorus reabsorption. In the case of acromegaly, this is thought to be
mediated by ​elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1.
Transcellular shift:
Acidosis inhibits phosphate entry into the cells, leading to mild
elevation in plasma phosphorus levels.
Hypoinsulinemia (same mechanism as acidosis)
Increased phosphate load:

147

Dietary indiscretion by the patient with CKD
Iatrogenic, for example, when a patient with CKD is given Fleet®
enemas
Vitamin D intoxication can result in increased intestinal absorption of
phosphorus.
Increased release of phosphorus from cellular stores
Rhabdomyolysis can cause severe hyperphosphatemia acutely, which
precipitates hypocalcaemia secondary to malignant calcium phosphate
deposition in soft tissues.
Tumor lysis syndrome usually follows chemotherapy for hematologic
malignancies or rapidly growing solid tumors.
Massive hemolysis

148

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms of acute hyperphosphatemia are generally attributable to
accompanying hypocalcaemia and include tetany, seizures, and
dysrhythmias.
Hypocalcaemia is thought to result from tissue deposition of calcium once
calcium × phosphate product reaches >55 and suppression of 1-α
hydroxylase by hyperphosphatemia.
Tissue deposition of calcium can occur in blood vessels, skin, kidneys,
and other organs.
149

Calciphylaxis is the term used for tissue ischemia that may result from the
calcification and subsequent thrombosis of small blood vessels.
Chronic hyperphosphatemia contributes to renal osteodystrophy.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Plasma creatinine helps assess renal function.
Intact PTH is elevated in CKD, but is low in the setting of
hypoparathyroidism.
Creatine kinase is markedly elevated in rhabdomyolysis.
Uric acid levels are often markedly elevated in tumor lysis syndrome in
addition to hyperphosphatemia.
Markers of hemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, bilirubin,
and so forth) are helpful in the appropriate setting.
Calcium levels are usually low in acute hyperphosphatemia but should
only be treated if symptoms occur, as treatment can precipitate,
worsening malignant calcium phosphate deposition.
Treatment
Acute hyperphosphatemia in patients who do not have renal
insufficiency can be managed by correcting the underlying cause and by
saline diuresis.
Chronic hyperphosphatemia is almost always a result of CKD, and the
treatment is aimed at reducing the intestinal absorption of phosphate.
Reduce enteric absorption of phosphorus:
Dietary restriction of phosphate. The first step is to institute dietary
restriction of phosphate to 600 to 900 mg/d.
150

Niacinamide. Niacinamide is the amide form of vitamin B and has been
shown to reduce phosphorus levels in the dialysis population by
decreasing the phosphorus uptake in the gut.8
Calcium-based phosphate binders:
Binders are agents that form insoluble complexes with dietary
phosphorus to prevent absorption of phosphorus in the gut.
Calcium-based binders are often used as first-line agents in patients with
CKD who are not on dialysis, as they are widely accessible and
inexpensive. However, adding a calcium load to a population at risk for
vascular calcification should be done with great caution and frequent
monitoring. In patients who already have hypercalcemia or evidence of
vascular calcification, an alternative should be utilized.
Calcium carbonate (TUMS) starting at 500 mg (200 mg elemental
calcium) tid with meals to a maximum of 3750 mg/d (1500 mg elemental
calcium).
Calcium acetate (PHOSLO) starting at 667 mg (167 mg elemental
calcium) tid with meals to a maximum of 6000 mg/d (1500 mg elemental
calcium).
Non–calcium-based phosphate binders: They are more expensive,
cause GI discomfort.
Sevelamer carbonate (RENVELA) starting at 800 mg tid with meals;
maximum dose 7200 mg/d.
Lanthanum carbonate (FOSRENOL) starting at 250 mg tid with meals;
maximum dose 3000 mg/d.
Hemodialysis:
In the dialysis population, elevated phosphorus levels may reflect dietary
indiscretions, binder noncompliance, or frequently missed dialysis
treatments. Resumption of all of the above is often sufficient to improve
plasma phosphorus concentrations.
151

Among dialysis modalities, daily nocturnal home hemodialysis is even
more effective than intermittent hemodialysis in phosphorus removal.
In the acute setting, dialysis may be warranted in patients with
symptomatic hypocalcemia from severe hyperphosphatemia in
conjunction with renal failure.

HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hypophosphatemia is defined as plasma phosphorus levels below the
normal range of 2.3 to 4.3 mg/dL.
Pathophysiology
Three main mechanisms for hypophosphatemia are redistribution of
extracellular phosphate into the intracellular space, decrease in intestinal
absorption of phosphate, or increase in renal excretion of phosphate
(Table 9-2).
Redistribution of extracellular phosphate (especially important in
hospital ​setting):
Respiratory alkalosis leads to a rise in intracellular pH, which in turn
stimulates glycolysis, and phosphate is incorporated into adenosine
triphosphate (ATP).
Refeeding syndrome can occur in chronically malnourished individuals,
typically 2 to 5 days after they are started on enteral or parenteral
feeding.9 Caloric replacement increases insulin secretion that stimulates
cell growth and enhances cellular uptake of phosphate for various
molecular pathways.
Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with intravenous (IV)
insulin leads to rapid flux of phosphorus into the cells.
152

Hungry bone syndrome after partial parathyroidectomy causes
movement of phosphate into the cells, leading to hypophosphatemia.
Decreased intestinal absorption (uncommon):
Malnutrition: Poor intake alone is very rarely sufficient to cause
hypophosphatemia, but if the quantity of phosphorus ingested remains
less than the amount lost in colonic secretions for a prolonged period of
time, hypophosphatemia may ensue. Typically, this occurs in conjunction
with one of the following exacerbating conditions.
Malabsorption syndromes: In addition to poor intake and absorption
of phosphorus and vitamin D, the accompanying diarrhea also
contributes to significant gastrointestinal (GI) losses.
Oral phosphate binders: Indiscriminate use of phosphate binders in
end-stage renal disease patients who may not be eating very well may
lead to low phosphorus levels.

153

Vitamin D deficiency: Severe deficiency of this vitamin can lead to
hypophosphatemia.
The secondary hyperparathyroidism resulting from vitamin D deficiency
contributes further to hypophosphatemia through increasing renal
phosphate excretion.
Alcoholism: Alcoholics often have poor intake of both phosphate and
vitamin D, resulting in total body phosphorus depletion. Use of dextrosecontaining IV fluids leads to insulin secretion, which further lowers
plasma phosphate by intracellular redistribution, as discussed above.
Increased renal excretion:
154

Hyperparathyroidism: PTH causes urinary phosphate loss.10
Hypophosphatemia is usually mild in primary hyperparathyroidism
because PTH also stimulates calcitriol synthesis, resulting in increased
intestinal absorption of phosphate.
However, in severe vitamin D deficiency, the resultant increase in PTH is
not accompanied by the compensatory rise in calcitriol levels and
hypophosphatemia can be severe.
After renal transplant: Renal phosphate wasting is common after
successful renal transplant due to persistently elevated PTH.
Osmotic diuresis: In DKA or recovering acute tubular necrosis (ATN),
excessive phosphate losses occur in urine, along with other solutes.
Fanconi’s syndrome: A defect in proximal tubular reabsorption will
cause phosphorus wasting. Although congenital forms of Fanconi’s
syndrome are very rare in adults, the syndrome can be a manifestation of
proximal tubule toxicity from light chains in multiple myeloma.
Familial X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is caused by
mutations in the PHEX gene. The condition is characterized by growth
retardation, renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and rickets.
Plasma concentrations of calcitriol are low.
Autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets has a similar
phenotype to XLH but is inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion.
Mutations in the FGF-23 are responsible for the disease.
Oncogenic osteomalacia: Paraneoplastic production of FGF-23 by
mesenchymal tumors is responsible for phosphaturia in cases of
oncogenic ​osteomalacia.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Symptoms and signs of hypophosphatemia are due to inability to make
155

ATP and occur if total body phosphate depletion is present and the
plasma phosphorus level is <1 mg/dL.
Neuromuscular symptoms: weakness, rhabdomyolysis, impaired
diaphragmatic function, paresthesias, dysarthria, confusion, seizures, and
coma.
Hematologic symptoms: hemolysis and platelet dysfunction.
Chronic hypophosphatemia leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia
in adults.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Fractional excretion of phosphorus and 24-hour urine phosphorus:
Fractional excretion of phosphorus >5% or a urine phosphate excretion
of >100 mg per 24 hours in the setting of hypophosphatemia indicates
excessive renal loss.
Excretion rates are lower in states of impaired intestinal absorption or
hypophosphatemia from transcellular shifts.
One exception is vitamin D deficiency, which causes phosphaturia from
secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Plasma calcium is typically low in secondary hyperparathyroidism from
vitamin D deficiency, but high or normal in primary
hyperparathyroidism.
25(OH) vitamin D level: Low levels suggest vitamin D deficiency.
PTH is elevated in primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism.
Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia accompany hypophosphatemia in
the
setting of refeeding syndrome.
156

TREATMENT
Moderate hypophosphatemia (1 to 2.5 mg/dL):
This is usually asymptomatic and can be managed primarily by treating
the underlying cause. Oral agents can be used to help restore serum
phosphorus to normal levels.
Neutra-Phos (250 mg phosphorus and 7 mEq each sodium and
potassium per capsule)
Neutra-Phos K (250 mg phosphorus and 14 mEq potassium per capsule)
K-Phos Neutral (250 mg phosphorus, 13 mEq of sodium, and 1 mEq of
potassium per tablet)
Severe hypophosphatemia (<1 mg/dL):
Most often requires IV phosphate.
Potassium phosphate (1.5 mEq potassium per mmol phosphate)
Sodium phosphate (1.3 mEq sodium per mmol phosphate)
IV infusion should be stopped when the plasma phosphorus level is >1.5
mg/dL or when PO therapy is possible.
Because of the need to replenish intracellular stores, 24 to 36 hours of
phosphate infusion may be required.
Hyperphosphatemia must be avoided, as it can cause hypocalcaemia and
ectopic calcification.
IV phosphate should be given cautiously in renal failure.

Acid–Base Disorders
Biju Marath and Steven Cheng

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Maintenance of acid–base status is essential for normal cellular function.
Minute changes in the concentration of [H+] can have dramatic impact
on the blood pH.
The body maintains acid–base homeostasis through three primary
mechanisms:
Chemical buffering by extracellular and intracellular buffers.
Controlling pCO2 through modulation of alveolar ventilation.
Altering net acid excretion (NAE) or the reabsorption of HCO3−.
Definitions
An acid is a substance that donates H+ ions and a base is a substance
that accepts H+ ions.1,2
Physiologic balance of the acid–base status can be described by the
following equation:
CO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3−
Acids and bases may be “strong” or “weak”
Strong acids (i.e., hydrochloric acid) and strong bases (i.e., sodium
hydroxide) are those that are almost completely ionized in the body.
159

The blood pH is a mathematic expression of the [H+] of the blood.
pH = -log [H+]
pH is thus inversely related to the [H+].
The normal extracellular [H+] is 40 nmol/L, correlating to a pH of 7.4.
In general, the range of H+ compatible with life is 16 to 160 nmol/L, or
a pH between 7.8 and 6.80.
The Henderson–Hasselbach equation shows the pH as a mathematical
relationship between HCO3− and pCO2.
pH = 6.1 + log[HCO3−]/(0.03 × pCO2)
Acidemia is an increase in the [H+] and a decrease in the pH.
Alkalemia is a decrease in the [H+] and a rise in the pH.
Classification
Acid and base disturbances are generally classified by the genesis of the
disorder.
Changes in the pCO2 are referred to as “Respiratory” processes.
A decrease in pH due to an increase in pCO2 is termed “Respiratory

Acidosis.”

An increase in pH due to a decrease in pCO2 is termed “Respiratory

Alkalosis.”

Changes in the [HCO3−] are referred to as “Metabolic” processes.
A decrease in pH due to a decrease in [HCO3−] is termed “Metabolic

Acidosis.”

160

An increase in pH due to an increase in [HCO3−] is termed “Metabolic

Alkalosis.”

Pathophysiology
Acid–base homeostasis is under constant challenge. For example, the
typical Western diet generates 1 mEq of acid/kg/d.
Maintaining a pH compatible with life in the context of a significant acid
load requires immediate buffering of the acid (primarily through
HCO3−), a ventilatory response to blow off CO2, and a system of
excretion to rid the system of the excess acid load and regenerate
HCO3−.3
Buffering:
Buffering is the ability of a solution to resist change in pH when a strong
acid or alkali is added.
HCO3− is the most important physiologic buffer in the extracellular fluid

(ECF) space.

As seen in the previous equation, HCO3− can combine with free H+ to

form H2CO3, which can subsequently convert to CO2 and H2O (see
ventilatory response, below)

Intracellular buffers include proteins, phosphates, and hemoglobin.
Bone can also absorb a significant acid load and, on dissolution, release
buffer compounds such as calcium carbonate and calcium bicarbonate.
Ventilatory response:
The ability to sense changes in pH and control pCO2 via alveolar

ventilation allows the body to further respond to the acid–base
imbalance.
161

In response to an acid load, a reduction in pCO2 attenuates the change

in pH by shifting the equation toward the generation of CO2 and H2O.
The normal pCO2 is 40 mm Hg.
The level falls with increased ventilation, and rises with decreased
ventilation.
Excretion:

Ultimately, NAE and reabsorption/regeneration of HCO3− is required to

return the system to balance.

This is accomplished through the renal elimination of titratable acids
(dihydrogen phosphate) and nontitratable acids (ammonium).
Bicarbonate reabsorption must also be maximized to excrete the daily
acid load.
The majority of bicarbonate reabsorption occurs at the proximal tubule.
Bicarbonate reabsorption is regulated by plasma HCO3− levels and

effective circulating volume.

Acid–base disorders arise when the capacity for resisting change in pH is
exceeded or when mechanisms used to maintain physiologic pH are
impaired (Figure 10-1).
Acidosis can occur from any of the following:
Metabolic insults:
A large acid load
Exogenous sources from toxic ingestions, such as ethylene glycol or other
alcohols
Endogenous sources during conditions such as lactic acidosis or
162

ketoacidosis, during which the body continually generates acids

DuBose TD, Cogan MG, Rector FC Jr. Acid-base disorders. In:
Brenner BM, ed. Brenner and Rector’s The Kidney. 5th ed.
Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 1996:949.)
A loss of bicarbonate buffer
Gastrointestinal (GI) loss (diarrhea).
Renal loss (proximal renal tubular acidosis [RTA]).
An inability to excrete the acid load (distal RTA).
Respiratory failure causes acidosis through the elevation of pCO2.
163

Alkalosis can occur from any of the following:
Metabolic insults:
Loss of H+-rich fluids.
Contraction alkalosis pairs loss of H+-rich fluids (i.e., nasogastric
suctioning) with increased bicarbonate reabsorption during the
subsequent volume contraction.
Excess reabsorption of bicarbonate.
Renal bicarbonate reabsorption can be stimulated by volume
contraction, hypochloremia, hypokalemia.
A decrease in pCO2 due to hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis).

Compensation:
164

Compensatory responses minimize the change in pH by minimizing the
alteration in the [HCO3−] to [pCO2] ratio.
Metabolic disturbances are thus attenuated by a respiratory
compensation.
In metabolic acidosis, a compensatory respiratory response decreases
pCO2 to attenuate the reduction in pH.
In metabolic alkalosis, a compensatory respiratory response increases
pCO2 to attenuate the rise in pH.
Respiratory disturbances are thus attenuated by a metabolic
compensation.
In respiratory acidosis, a compensatory metabolic response increases
[HCO3−].
In respiratory alkalosis, a compensatory metabolic response decreases
[HCO3−].
Of note, compensatory metabolic responses require time to exert their
maximal effect. As a result, the extent of metabolic compensation can
sometimes be used to gauge the duration of the respiratory insult.
Expected values for compensatory responses are found in Table 10-1.
Compensations, however, are never complete. Although compensation
attenuates the change in pH, it is not sufficient to restore pH to its initial
value before the primary disturbance occurred.

METABOLIC ACIDOSIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
165

Metabolic acidosis is a clinical disorder characterized by low pH and low
HCO3−.
The appropriate respiratory compensation is hyperventilation resulting
in low pCO2.

DIAGNOSIS
Metabolic acidosis is further categorized into those that have an
increased anion gap (AG, also known as an AG acidosis) and those that
have a normal AG (also known as a non-AG acidosis).
Diagnostic Testing
Differentiating the various forms of metabolic acidosis is critical for
management.
Step 1: AG versus non-AG.
In patients with an AG acidosis, the acid dissociates into H+ and an
“unmeasured” anion.
Detection of this “unmeasured anion” is possible through the AG, a
simple difference between the measured cations and anions that
predominate in the ECF space.
AG = [Na+] – ([Cl−] + [HCO3−])
Normal AG is 10 ± 3 mEq/L
This normal AG typically reflects the presence of unmeasured negative
charges from plasma albumin.
Because of this, a fall in serum albumin of 1 g/dL (from normal of 4
g/dL) decreases the AG by 2.5 mEq/L.
An increase in the AG reflects an accumulation of other unmeasured
anions, such as lactate and acetate, from the various causes of an AG
166

acidosis.
The amount by which the AG increases (∆AG) typically approximates the
amount by which the serum HCO3− decreases (∆HCO3).
The relationship between ∆AG/∆HCO3 is often referred to as the delta

ratio.

A significant disparity between the ∆AG and the ∆HCO3 suggests a

superimposed metabolic disorder.

When ∆AG << ∆HCO3, the disproportional reduction in serum HCO3

should raise suspicion of a superimposed nongap metabolic acidosis.

When ∆AG >> ∆HCO3, the decrease in serum HCO3 has been attenuated

by another process, and one should look for sources of a superimposed
metabolic alkalosis or a pre-existing chronic respiratory acidosis with a
compensatory increase in serum bicarbonate.

To further identify the nature of the unmeasured anion, additional
laboratory tests can be sent, including serum lactate levels and assays for
ketone bodies (as described above).
Step 2 (non-AG): renal versus GI defect.
In a non-AG acidosis, the differential includes renal causes (RTA) and
enteric bicarbonate losses. These can be differentiated by using the urine
AG.
The urine AG is the difference between the measured cations (Na and K)
and anions (Cl) in the urine. The value is calculated with the following
formula:

Urine AG = [Na+] + [K+] − [Cl–]
In physiologic states with normal acid–base handling, the urine AG has a
167

slightly positive value (0 to ∼30).
In states of acidosis, the kidney normally increases ammonia production
to allow enhanced excretion of the acid load. Higher urine ammonium
concentration is balanced by higher Cl levels. Thus, with an
appropriately high ammonium in the urine, the urine AG becomes
negative because the chloride concentration exceeds Na + K.
If urinary acidification is inadequate due to RTA, the urine ammonium
levels remain low and the urine AG remains positive.
Differential Diagnosis
See Table 10-2.
Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis
AG metabolic acidosis encompasses disorders of organic acidosis resulting
from increased acid production.
Lactic acidosis:
Under normal conditions, humans produce relatively small amounts of
lactate, the final production of anaerobic metabolism of pyruvate.

168

An increase in production can occur from any of the following:
Decrease in tissue oxygenation (e.g., hypoxemia, septic shock)
Excessive energy expenditures (e.g., seizures, hyperthermia)
Deranged oxidative metabolism (e.g., intoxications, malignancy)
Impaired lactate clearance (e.g., liver failure)
D-lactic acidosis production by D-lactic acid-producing organisms. A
separate assay for D-lactate should be ordered if clinical suspicion is high
(e.g., blind loop syndromes), as the standard lactate assay does not detect
this isomer.
Treatment of lactic acidosis must be directed at the underlying cause.
Therapy with HCO3– has not been found to be effective clinically and
may even have deleterious effects.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA):
It results from a lack of sufficient insulin to metabolize glucose and
short-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are instead oxidized to the ketoacids
(β-hydroxybutyric and acetoacetic acid), resulting in acid–base
disturbance.
Ketoacids are relatively strong acids and dissociate almost completely,
causing a metabolic acidosis with an elevated AG.
Initially, the AG may parallel the decrease in HCO3− level.
With therapy, the AG may normalize prior to the HCO3− due to rapid

renal elimination of the ketoacid, as renal perfusion improves with
volume restoration.
Diagnosis of DKA is made by the combination of AG metabolic
acidosis, hyperglycemia, and the presence of serum or urine
ketones.
169

The diagnostic test to detect ketones uses a nitroprusside reagent that
reacts with acetoacetate only.
In early DKA, the ratio of β-hydroxybutyric acid to acetoacetic acid is
5:2.
During treatment of DKA, the formation of acetoacetate is favored, so
the nitroprusside test may falsely demonstrate a rise in ketones as this
ratio varies.
Mainstays of therapy for DKA are insulin, volume repletion, and the
management of electrolyte abnormalities. Bicarbonate therapy has not
been found to improve outcome in limited clinical trials.
Alcohol or starvation ketoacidosis:
It should be suspected in patients with a history of alcohol abuse with
an unexplained high-AG metabolic acidosis.
Combination of alcohol ingestion and poor dietary intake is the cause of
the ketoacidosis.
Ratio of β-hydroxybutyric acid to acetoacetic acid is up to 20:1.
Therefore, the nitroprusside test may grossly underestimate the degree of
ketoacidemia in these patients.
Therapy consists of vigorous volume, glucose, and electrolyte repletion.
Toxic alcohol ingestions:
The examples include methanol and ethylene glycol.
Methanol and ethylene glycol are low-molecular-weight alcohols that
readily enter cells.
The metabolites are formate (with methanol) or glycolate (with ethylene
glycol) and are responsible for the high AG.
Initial acid–base status may be normal soon after ingestion. However, an
170

early clue is an increased osmolar gap.
Osmolar gap = measured serum osmolality – calculated osmolality
Calculated serum osmolality = 2[Na+] + [glucose]/18 +
[urea]/2.8
A difference of >15 to 20 mOsm/kg suggests toxic alcohol ingestion.
An osmolar gap can also be due to other conditions that are not
associated with a high-AG acidosis, including ethanol and isopropyl
alcohol.
Patients with methanol poisoning present with abdominal pain,
vomiting, headache, and visual disturbances (optic neuritis).
Ethylene glycol intoxication is similar to that of methanol, but does not
produce optic neuritis. Calcium oxalate crystals (metabolite of ethylene
glycol) in the urine also suggest ethylene glycol intoxication.
Most morbidity of methanol and ethylene glycol results from damage
mediated by metabolites.
Blocking the metabolism is of prime importance in the treatment of these
ingestions. This can be done by use of fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole).
Fomepizole blocks alcohol dehydrogenase, thereby retarding metabolism
of methanol and ethylene glycol.
Hemodialysis may also be required to correct severe metabolic
abnormalities and to enhance toxic metabolite elimination.
Salicylate overdose:
Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, altered mental status,
coma, and death.
Symptoms correlate poorly with plasma levels, but almost always are
present with very high levels (>50 mg/dL).
171

Treatment:
Alkalinizing the urine with HCO3– infusion may reduce symptoms and

promote renal excretion.

Hemodialysis should be considered for patients with extremely high
levels, severe symptoms, significant renal failure, or refractory acidosis.
Acetaminophen ingestion:
It results from the accumulation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid).
Glutathione metabolism is thought to be the mechanism.
Cessation of the drug leads to resolution of the problem.
Acute or chronic renal failure may lead to high-AG acidosis.
Failure to excrete the daily acid load by retention of anions (e.g.,
phosphates, sulfates) is the pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis.
For both acute and chronic renal failure, the AG rises more slowly than
the HCO3– level drops.
In acute renal failure, the HCO3– level falls by ∼0.5 mEq/L/d, unless

hypercatabolism increases daily acid production.

In chronic renal failure, the AG rises by ∼0.5 mEq/L for each 1-mg/dL
rise in serum creatinine.
Nongap (Hyperchloremic) Metabolic Acidosis
GI loss:
Diarrhea and enteric fistulas account for the majority of nongap
metabolic acidosis.
RTA:
172

They are heterogeneous group of disorders defined by the presence of
metabolic acidosis due to diminished NAE by the kidney, despite a normal
glomerular filtration rate.4

On the basis of pathophysiologic mechanisms, RTA can be classified as
follows (Table 10-3):
Type I (classic distal) RTA:
It is characterized by defects in secretion, permeability, or voltage
gradients, resulting in the inability of the kidney to excrete hydrogen.
Except for the voltage-type defects, in all other forms of type I RTA,
potassium becomes the preferred cation for excretion, leading to
hypokalemia.
Main causes of type I RTA are hypercalcemia, nephrocalcinosis,
autoimmune diseases (especially Sjögren syndrome), drugs (amphotericin
B, lithium, and ifosfamide), and toxins like toluene.

173

It can also occur as a primary disorder in children and can be hereditary.
Diagnosis is based on the inability to lower the urine pH to <5.4 and the
response to NaHCO3 treatment.
Treatment for type I RTA is indicated to correct the acidosis and
minimize stone formation and nephrocalcinosis. In adults, 1 to 2
mEq/kg/d of alkali is usually necessary.
Type II (proximal) RTA:
It is an uncommon disorder due to the impairment of proximal tubular
reabsorption of HCO3−.
Increased delivery of bicarbonate to the distal nephron leads to
substantial potassium and sodium loss as well.
It is a self-limiting disorder, because the reabsorptive capacity of HCO3–

in the distal nephron remains intact.

Initially, the plasma HCO3– concentration will drop to between 14 and

20 mEq/L, resulting in a lowered filtered load that will not exceed
reabsorptive capacity.

At this point, acidification will return to normal in the distal nephron.
Therefore, the urine pH is variable depending on whether bicarbonate
escapes proximal reabsorption.
Infusion of bicarbonate should raise the urinary pH, and the fractional
excretion of HCO3–, thereby establishing the diagnosis.
Main causes include hereditary causes (e.g., Wilson disease or
cystinosis), metal toxicity (lead, cadmium, or mercury), and multiple
myeloma or amyloidosis.
Fanconi syndrome refers to type II RTA in the setting of more global
174

proximal tubule dysfunction, with impairment of glucose, amino acid,
and phosphate reabsorption. In children, treatment may require large
amounts of alkali (10 to 25 mEq/kg/d) to avoid growth retardation and
osteopenia from the acidosis.
Type IV (distal hyperkalemic) RTA:
It is metabolic acidosis secondary to aldosterone deficiency or resistance.
Hypoaldosteronism (e.g., primary or secondary to diabetes mellitus)
impairs distal hydrogen and potassium secretion, leading to hyperkalemic
metabolic acidosis.
Hyperkalemia also suppresses NH4+ synthesis in the proximal tubule,
further worsening the kidneys’ ability to excrete an acid load.
Generalized tubular defects, like obstructive uropathy, cyclosporine, or
lupus, may also result in type IV RTA by affecting H+ secretion at the
cortical collecting duct.
Treatment options for patients with hyperkalemia and metabolic
acidosis include a low-potassium diet, sodium bicarbonate replacement,
and loop diuretics. Patients with hypoaldosteronism often require
mineralocorticoid replacement. Patients with general tubular defects
usually do not have a significant degree of acidosis but may require
treatment for hyperkalemia.
Other causes:
Dilutional acidosis is due to the rapid expansion of extracellular space
with non-HCO3− fluid. The fall in HCO3− level is usually small and
quickly corrected by renal generation of HCO3−.

Parenteral alimentation of amino acids without concomitant
administration of alkali may produce hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
This can be avoided by replacing the chloride salt of amino acids with
acetate salt. The acetate is then metabolized to HCO3− and replaces that
which was consumed in amino acid metabolism.
175

Ingestion of sulfur or other inorganic acids can cause profound
hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

TREATMENT
Treatment of metabolic acidosis is usually best accomplished by
treating the underlying disease.5,6
In certain situations (e.g., lactic acidosis or DKA), alkali therapy is not
beneficial and may be deleterious. However, in patients with severe
acidosis, rapid ​a dministration of HCO3− may be necessary for
cardiovascular stability. With severe acidemia, the initial goal is to
raise the pH to >7.20. The amount of HCO3− required to correct the
acidemia can be estimated by the HCO3− deficit:

HCO3− deficit = HCO3− space (L) × (desired HCO3− – actual

HCO3−)

where HCO3− space (theoretic volume of HCO3− distribution) = 0.5 –

0.8 × body weight in kg.

The HCO3− space is not constant, but increases with increasing severity

of the acidosis.

In normal state, this space is 50% of body weight, but increases to as
high as 80% in severe acidosis (bicarbonate <10 mEq/L). This results
from greater use of nonbicarbonate buffers as acidosis worsens.
In acute settings, intravenous (IV) sodium HCO3− (50 mEq in 50-mL

ampules) can be given as a bolus or continuous infusion (two to three
ampules mixed in D5W).
In chronic metabolic acidosis, oral alkali can be given as sodium
bicarbonate tablets or as sodium or potassium citrate solution. Typical
starting doses would be sodium bicarbonate 650 mg two to three times
176

daily (16 to 24 mEq/d), with the dose increased if necessary.

METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Metabolic alkalosis is a clinical disorder characterized by elevated pH due
to an increase in HCO3–. Compensatory hypoventilation results in a rise
of pCO2.

DIAGNOSIS
Disorders of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into chloride-responsive
(chloride depletion acts as a maintenance factor), chloride-resistant
(chloride depletion does not act as a maintenance factor), and unclassified
categories (Table 10-4).

Diagnostic Testing
Chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis occurs in volume-depleted states
with low urine chloride levels (<25 mEq).
In metabolic alkalosis, urine chloride levels may be a more accurate
determination of volume state than are urine sodium levels.
The urinary chloride level may be elevated if it is obtained while a
177

diuretic is still in effect. However, more than 24 to 48 hours after the last
diuretic dose, the urine chloride is appropriately low, reflecting volume
depletion.
Chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis occurs in euvolemic states and is
associated with elevated urine chloride levels (>40 mEq/L).
Differential Diagnosis
Chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis:
Vomiting or gastric drainage:
It is one of the most common causes of metabolic alkalosis.
Gastric secretions contain as much as 100 mmol/L of acid. Gastric
parietal cells generate one HCO3– molecule for each H+ secreted.
Maintenance of metabolic alkalosis occurs due to the subsequent volume
contraction.
Diuretics:
Diuretics that exert their effect at the thick, ascending limb of the loop of
Henle (loop diuretics) or at the distal tubule (thiazide diuretics) stimulate
H+ secretion through renin/aldosterone to initiate metabolic alkalosis.
In addition, these diuretics maintain metabolic alkalosis by volume
depletion.
In the posthypercapnic state, the renal compensation to chronic
hypercapnia is an elevation in HCO3–. When hypercapnia is corrected too
quickly, the patient has an elevated level of HCO3– until renal
readjustment can occur.

Chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis:
Primary hyperaldosteronism:
178

This leads to hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis secondary to aldosterone
stimulation of distal H+ secretion.
It often occurs in concert with hypertension and volume expansion.
Corticosteroid excess:
Many of these corticosteroids have considerable mineralocorticoid effects
to produce hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.
Cushing’s syndrome can cause this due to the overproduction of
corticosteroid.
Black licorice contains glycyrrhizic acid, which decreases the enzymatic
conversion of cortisol to cortisone. Cortisol thus continues to activate
mineralocorticoid receptors, mimicking mineralocorticoid excess.
Bartter syndrome is a rare condition presenting in children with
increased renin levels and hyperaldosteronism without hypertension or
sodium
retention.
The disease occurs due to mutations in the Na+/K+/2Cl– channel in the
thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to Na+, K+, and Cl–
wasting.
Bartter syndrome may be difficult to distinguish from surreptitious
diuretic use and may require screening urine for presence of diuretics.
Unclassified metabolic alkalosis:
Administration of HCO3– or organic anions that metabolize into HCO3–

(citrate or acetate) can lead to metabolic alkalosis, especially in patients
with renal insufficiency.
Milk-alkali syndrome is seen in patients who consume a large amount
of antacids containing calcium and alkali (e.g., calcium carbonate).

179

Hypercalcemia decreases parathyroid-hormone-mediated HCO3– loss and

also causes alkalosis through contraction.

This may be supported by decreased glomerular filtration rate.
In addition, the alkalosis acts to reduce calcium excretion and enhances
the effect of hypercalcemia.
Massive transfusion of blood products (>10 U packed RBCs) can
produce moderate metabolic alkalosis secondary to elevated citrate that
metabolizes into HCO3–.
Similarly, metabolic alkalosis may be seen in patients undergoing
plasmapheresis, as replacement plasma has citrate.

TREATMENT
However, when the pH elevation becomes life threatening (>7.60),
rapid reduction in pH can be achieved by hemodialysis.5,6
In these acute settings, administration of hydrochloric acid or other
acids is not advocated due to significant potential complications.
For nonurgent cases, therapy is based on whether the case is chloride
responsive or chloride resistant.
Chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis:
It typically responds to the administration of oral or IV sodium
chloride in 0.9% or 0.45% solution with potassium supplements.
This lowers the plasma HCO3– level by reversing the contraction

alkalosis, decreasing sodium retention, and promoting HCO3– excretion.
Optimal rate of fluid replacement is ∼50 to 100 mL/h in excess of the
sum of all sensible and insensible losses.

180

In edematous states (e.g., patient with heart failure), the administration
of saline may not be an option.
In some instances, ongoing diuresis may be necessary to prevent
pulmonary edema, despite intravascular contraction.
Acetazolamide (250 to 375 mg PO daily or bid) is a carbonic anhydrase
inhibitor that decreases proximal sodium reabsorption while increasing
renal excretion of HCO3-. Its effect on attenuating metabolic alkalosis can
be monitored with urine pH, which should increase to >7.0.

Concurrent hypokalemia must be corrected for metabolic alkalosis to
resolve.
In addition, for gastric causes, the use of H2-blockers or proton-pump

inhibitors minimizes the gastric acid loss.

For diuretic-induced metabolic alkalosis, the use of potassium-sparing
diuretics can reduce the degree of the acid–base disturbance.
Chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis:
It does not respond to the administration of volume.
For mineralocorticoid excess states, successful treatment requires
restoration of normal mineralocorticoid activity, including surgical
removal of an adrenal adenoma or by the use of potassium-sparing
diuretics in addition to potassium supplements.
Bartter syndrome may respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
potassium-sparing diuretics, and potassium supplements.

RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pathophysiology
181

Acute respiratory acidosis results from acute alveolar hypoventilation
when only the buffering defense is available.
Chronic respiratory acidosis is caused by chronic decreased effective
alveolar ventilation. Over time, the renal compensatory mechanisms
operate at maximal capacity.

DIAGNOSIS
Respiratory acidosis is a disorder caused by processes that increase pCO2,

resulting in a decrease in pH and a compensatory increase in HCO3−.
The increase in pCO2 is due to decreased alveolar ventilation. The

physiologic buffer systems generate the immediate response to the low
pH during the acute phase.
Over the next several days, renal compensation is initiated through an
increase in NAE termed the chronic phase.
The third response to respiratory acidosis is the restoration of effective
ventilation.
Differential Diagnosis
The causes of acute respiratory acidosis include neuromuscular
abnormalities, airway obstruction, thoracic-pulmonary disorders, vascular
disease, respiratory muscle fatigue, and mechanical ventilation.
The causes of chronic respiratory acidosis include thoracic-pulmonary
disorders (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and
neuromuscular abnormalities.
When a patient in a steady state of chronic hypercapnia suffers a new
insult, the pCO2 acutely rises. This is termed acute respiratory acidosis
superimposed on chronic respiratory acidosis.

TREATMENT
182

Treatment is restoration of effective ventilation.
In chronic respiratory acidosis, treatment is difficult, but maximizing
pulmonary function may lead to significant improvement.

RESPIRATORY ALKALOSI
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pathophysiology
Acute respiratory alkalosis results from acute alveolar hyperventilation
when only the buffering defense is available.
Patients may present with paresthesias, muscle cramps, tinnitus, and
even seizures.
Chronic respiratory alkalosis is caused by chronic increased effective
alveolar ventilation. During this period, the renal compensatory
mechanisms are fully exerted.

DIAGNOSIS
Respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid–base disorder in
seriously ill patients.
Respiratory alkalosis is a disorder caused by processes that decrease
pCO2, resulting in an increase in pH and a compensatory decrease in

HCO3–. The decrease in pCO2 is due to increased alveolar ventilation.
The buffering response constitutes the acute phase, and the renal
response defines the chronic stage of respiratory alkalosis.
The third response to respiratory alkalosis is the restoration of
appropriate ventilation.
Differential Diagnosis
183

Causes of respiratory alkalosis include central stimulation of respiration
(e.g., fever, anxiety, and head trauma), peripheral stimulation of
respiration (e.g., pulmonary embolism and pneumonia), liver
insufficiency, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation.

TREATMENT
The key to therapy is treating the underlying cause. Correcting
significant hypoxemia may be more important than the acid–base
disturbance.

SOME EXAMPLES OF MIXED ACID–BASE
DISTURBANCES AND THEIR EVALUATION
A SIMPLE CHANGE IN MEDICINES
A patient with chronic lung disease with edema received diuretics. An
arterial blood gas (ABG) test done a week earlier showed pH, 7.38; pCO2,
50 mm Hg; and HCO3−, 29 mmol/L. He presents now with weakness,

dizziness, and a low blood pressure. His ABG test values are pH, 7.46;
pCO2, 56 mm Hg; and HCO3−, 39 mmol/L. A review of his baseline
laboratory values reveals a mild respiratory acidosis with adequate
metabolic compensation. The change was the introduction of diuretics.
Step 1: pH is elevated, indicating alkalemia.
Step 2: HCO3− is elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis. The pCO2 is

elevated as well, but this signifies an acidosis of respiratory origin. As the
pH is alkalemic, the primary change in this acid–base disorder is a
metabolic alkalosis, and the elevated pCO2 (above baseline) is an
attempt at compensation.

Step 3: Information for calculation of AG is not given; hence, it is
assumed to be within normal limits.
Step 4: The next step is to gauge the appropriateness of the
184

compensatory response. Acutely, if the HCO3− is changed by 10 mmol/L,
the expected change in the pCO2 would be to 57 mm Hg (Table 10-1),
which is quite close to this patient’s value.

Step 5: It appears that this patient with chronic compensated respiratory
acidosis developed an acute metabolic alkalosis. Given the clinical
circumstances, it is clear that the diuretic therapy caused hypovolemia
and contraction alkalosis, making the pH alkalemic.
Step 6: Appropriate therapy is withdrawal of diuretics and volume
repletion.
Mind the Gaps
A 25-year-old female with acute respiratory distress syndrome in the
medical intensive care unit (ICU) requires inverse ratio ventilation to
maintain adequate oxygenation. At 2 days after initiation of this therapy,
her morning ABG reads pH, 7.12; pCO2, 38 mm Hg; and HCO3−, 12
mmol/L. Other laboratory data are as follows: Na, 130 mmol/L; Cl, 93
mmol/L; K, 5.0 mmol/L; blood urea nitrogen, 40 mg/dL; and glucose,
100 mg/dL.
Step 1: pH is very low, indicating severe acidemia.
Step 2: HCO3− is quite low, suggesting metabolic acidosis.
Step 3: The patient has a significant AG (25). The HCO3− level is

appropriate for the gap.

Step 4: pCO2 is slightly decreased; however, no evident compensation

has occurred.

Step 5: Thus, a formulation is made for severe AG metabolic acidosis
without compensation.
Her renal function is normal, as are lactic acid levels; serum ketones
are not detectable. Serum osmolality is noted to be 330 mOsm/L. As her
185

calculated osmolality is 280 mOsm/L, she has an osmolal gap of 50,
which is abnormal. However, most of the usual o enders that can cause
an elevated osmolal gap (ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and so
forth) are unlikely here, as the patient is in an ICU. The o ending agent
is identi ed after a careful review of medicines: the patient was started
on high-dose infusions of lorazepam to enhance sedation during inverse
ratio ventilation. Lorazepam infusions contain propylene glycol, which
can cause metabolic acidosis with AGs and osmolal gaps, should
su ciently high doses be used. Such high doses are sometimes required in
the ICU, exposing the patient to the risk of propylene glycol toxicity.
Propylene glycol levels can be measured and correlate quite strongly with
osmolality and osmolal gap.
A Gap in the Gap
A 25-year-old diabetic was admitted to the ICU with profound
ketoacidosis, pH of 7.1, and AG of 25. Treatment was started with IV
saline and insulin infusion. A few hours later, the following ABG results
were received: pH, 7.28; pCO2, 28 mm Hg; HCO3−, 13 mEq/L; and AG,
18.

Step 1: pH is decreased, suggesting acidemia.
Step 2: HCO3− is low, suggesting metabolic acidosis. The pCO2 is low,

reflecting respiratory compensation for the acidemia.

Step 3: The AG is 18. Expected HCO3− for this AG is 19 (taking 12 as

normal AG and 25 as normal HCO3− value). However, the observed

HCO3− is 13. This suggests the presence of a non-AG metabolic acidosis
in addition to an AG metabolic acidosis and respiratory compensation.

Step 4: Expected pCO2 is 28 mm Hg. As observed, pCO2 is 28 mm Hg as

well, the compensatory response is appropriate.

Step 5: It is clear that the patient who presented with an AG metabolic
acidosis now has a non-AG acidosis in addition, with persistent (although
186

improved) acidemia and appropriate respiratory compensation. Two
fundamentally important factors in addressing a metabolic acidosis are to
look for an AG and to decide if the acidosis is entirely due to the gap
process or to a combination of a gap acidosis along with a nongap
acidosis. Matching the observed HCO3− to the expected HCO3− for the
gap observed helps in detecting a hidden nongap acidosis.

The development of nongap acidosis is common in ketoacidosis due to
ketoacid metabolism of and excretion in the urine. Administration of
insulin helps metabolize the ketone bodies to HCO3−. The HCO3−
generated is used to bu er intracellular acidosis. Thus, although the AG
closes (due to the removal of ketones), the HCO3− level and acidemia
lag behind, accounting for the nongap acidosis.
When All Is Not What It Seems
At times, mixed acid–base disorders can be difficult to detect if not
carefully and systematically scrutinized. A patient in the ICU developed
pancreatitis, and nasogastric suction was instituted for 2 to 3 days. The
course was complicated by sepsis and shock. The following laboratory
values were received: pH, 7.41; pCO2, 40 mm Hg; HCO3−, 25 mEq/L;

Na, 140 mmol/L; and Cl, 90 mmol/L. The pH, pCO2, and HCO3− values

are in the normal range. Thus, if the casual observer decided to stop here,
the fact that there is an AG of 25 would be completely missed.
The presence of an AG is strong evidence of a metabolic acidosis.
Expected HCO3− for an AG of 25 is 12 mEq/L. The HCO3− level in this
patient is 25, suggesting a coexisting metabolic alkalosis.

A review of the clinical scenario explains the acid–base abnormalities.
The metabolic alkalosis was generated by nasogastric suction. At this
point, septic shock developed. The resulting metabolic acidosis
counterbalanced the pH and HCO3− concentration. This is a good

example of a mixed disorder with a metabolic alkalosis and abnormal AG.
Triple acid–base disorders are combinations of metabolic acidosis and
187

alkalosis with either respiratory acidosis or respiratory alkalosis. (The
two respiratory disorders cannot coexist; one cannot breathe fast and
slow simultaneously.)

Overview and Management of
Acute Kidney Injury
Andrew Siedlecki and Anitha Vijayan

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is among the most commonly encountered
diseases in the hospital setting, with national prevalence of 13%.
AKI is synonymous with the historical term acute renal failure.
In the acute setting, a small elevation in serum creatinine (SCr; 0.3
mg/dL) is independently associated with increased mortality and
substantial financial cost to the healthcare system.
Awareness of AKI is limited by the sensitivity of SCr, the standard
biomarker of kidney damage, and therefore requires clinical context to
either anticipate or mitigate the disease course.
Early recognition of AKI by the physician is essential to the care of the
hospitalized patient.
Definition
Criterion for AKI is met when one of the following conditions is true: an
abrupt (within 48 hours) reduction in kidney function due to a rise
in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dL or documented oliguria of <0.5 mL/kg/h for
more than
6 hours.1
A 50% increase in SCr also warrants alarm, but such nonfixed changes in
SCr have been difficult to verify in large epidemiologic studies.
189

This definition of AKI has gained the support of the Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) foundation, which generates
guidelines for the international field of nephrology.2
Classification
Criteria for AKI are standardized to facilitate communication between
practitioners and to clarify the results of outcomes-based analyses.
A simplified staging system compiled by the Acute Kidney Injury Network
(AKIN) group that categorizes the severity of AKI is shown in Table 11-1.
This criteria evolved from the staging system that was previously outlined
in the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease)
criteria.3
Staging has yet to be confirmed as a significant predictor of patient
morbidity or mortality, and continues to be evaluated with covariates
that represent high-risk populations.
Although the terminology has changed from ARF to AKI, the disease
remains subclassified into prerenal, postrenal, and intrinsic renal
injury.
Prerenal azotemia refers to problems with renal perfusion, either from
decreased intravascular volume, decreased blood pressure, or decrease in
effective circulating volume. Postrenal azotemia is caused by obstruction
to urine flow and accounts for ∼5% to 15% of all cases of AKI.

Intrinsic renal injury can be from glomerular, microvascular,
190

interstitial, or tubular causes. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a
disease of the sick hospitalized patient and will be discussed in detail in
this chapter. Other intrinsic causes of AKI are discussed elsewhere in the
book.
Epidemiology
Generally AKI is a disease of the hospitalized patient, with ∼13.5% of all
hospitalized patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for AKI. As can be
expected, the number is much higher in patients with multiorgan failure
and in the intensive care unit (ICU).5 In contrast, only ∼1% of all
patients presenting to the emergency room have the diagnosis of AKI.
AKI is associated with high mortality, which has not changed
significantly in the last 55 years. The average mortality in an ICU patient
with AKI is quoted anywhere from 45% to 60%. Studies have
demonstrated that AKI is an independent factor contributing to the
mortality and not just an innocent bystander, as previously believed. In a
study of hospitalized patients who received intravenous (IV)
radiocontrast procedures, the risk of mortality was increased by
5.5-fold in those who developed AKI (compared to patients who did not
develop renal injury), after accounting for comorbid conditions.1,6
Some of the possible reasons for the persistent poor survival in AKI
include:
Delay in diagnosis of AKI: By the time a patient’s SCr increases 0.3
mg/dL, renal function would have declined by at least 25%.7 Creatinine
remains a late marker of AKI and is being challenged by more sensitive
and biologically significant markers such as Neutrophil gelatinase
associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C.8
Inability of dialysis to provide actual renal replacement: The
endocrine, cytokine, and immunologic functions of the kidney are not
being replaced with dialysis.
Delay in initiation of dialysis: The optimal timing of renal
replacement therapy (RRT) remains a question, with limited studies
191

suggesting that early initiation of dialysis might improve the outcome.
Inadequate dialysis prescription: Studies have shown that prescribed
dialysis efficiency is rarely achieved in AKI. However, two recent trials in
AKI suggested that increasing the dose of RRT may not necessarily
improve outcome. These studies are discussed in the chapter on renal
replacement therapy.

DIAGNOSIS
The initial diagnostic evaluation of a patient suspected of AKI is
triggered by either an increase in SCr or decrease in urine output over
several hours.
A stepwise approach should always focus on delineating whether AKI is
the result of prerenal or postrenal processes, with the understanding that
intrinsic renal injury will likely take a more thorough battery of testing
and may not be forthcoming by evaluation of the patient’s volume status
and urinary outlet alone.
By definition, prerenal and postrenal lesions impose functional
restraints on renal performance and anticipate dramatic improvement in
solute clearance after removal of such lesions, if achieved in a timely
fashion. Prerenal and postrenal AKI are discussed in detail in the
following chapter.
In contrast, intrinsic AKI is not expected to reverse swiftly and the
clinical course and prognosis depend on the underlying cause.
In the ICU, the most common cause is ATN, usually due to both ischemic
and toxic insults (multifactorial ATN).
Clinical Presentation
The following questions should be answered by the end of the history and
physical exam in a patient with AKI.
Is the patient volume depleted?
192

Does the patient have a urinary tract obstruction?
Has this patient been exposed to a major nephrotoxin (medications, IV
contrast, over-the-counter agents, herbal products, and so forth)?
Could this patient have intrinsic renal disease?
Does the patient have a preexisting condition (e.g., decompensated
congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, peripheral vascular
disease) increasing vulnerability to renal injury?
Is there a need for further serologic testing and/or renal biopsy?
History
Urine patterns and frequency:
Estimate daily urine volumes and recent trends (1 “Dixie” cup = 75 mL,
1 coffee cup = 225 mL, 1 cola can = 350 mL, 24-hour urine container =
2.5 L).
Elicit any history of hematuria, dysuria, or pyuria.
Urgency, frequency, dribbling, and incontinence, especially in elderly
men, may point toward prostatic disease.
Onset of urinary symptoms may also provide a temporal clue to the
duration of illness.
For hospitalized patients, a careful review of the intake, output, and
daily weights is essential.
Volume status:
History of dizziness, orthostatic instability, dependent lifestyle,
prolonged nursing home stay, and unmonitored chronic diuretic use, may
point toward intravascular depletion, whereas weight gain, edema, or
periorbital swelling (especially in the mornings) may signify fluid
retention.
193

Consider the possible mechanisms of fluid loss—hemorrhage, diarrhea,
polyuria, and situations leading to excessive insensitive losses (e.g., fever
or diminished intake due to dysphagia, surgical wounds closing by
secondary intention)—as they all predispose to volume depletion.
Review the patient’s records or hospital chart in detail for episodes of
blood pressure swings.
For postoperative patients with AKI, it is essential to review the intraand postoperative hemodynamic records.
Medications:
A thorough review of the patient’s medications is essential in
pinpointing the correct diagnosis.
This includes over-the-counter medicines (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], high dose acetaminophen), herbal
products, and other health and food supplements.
Scout for nephrotoxins in the hospital chart (e.g., NSAIDs, renin–
angiotensin– aldosterone system inhibitors, aminoglycosides,
polymyxins).
In hospitalized patients, exclude covert nephrotoxic exposure, such as
iodine-based IV contrast media with radiologic studies and angiograms.
Some drugs may precipitate or exacerbate urinary retention and should
be considered as possible causes of postrenal AKI (e.g., tricyclic
antidepressants, carbidopa, disopyramide and certain antihypertensive
agents).
Several herbal products, such as herbal appetite suppressants (Hoodia
Gordonii9) and herbal diuretics (Radix Tripterygii10), have been implicated
in AKI because of volume depletion.
Herbals containing aristolochic acid may cause interstitial nephritis and
tubular necrosis.11
194

Infections:
The source and severity of infection, as well as the treatment strategies
for the infection, in a patient with AKI must be carefully reviewed.
Sepsis initiates an innate immune response and can lead to renal
vasoconstriction and ATN.
Some infectious organisms directly lead to renal involvement: For
example, Legionella infection can cause an interstitial nephritis.
Indirect causes include bacterial endocarditis or hepatitis C with
cryoglobulinemia, both of which can cause an immune complex
deposition glomerulonephritis.
Finally, the many different antibiotics in use today can cause
nephrotoxicity, either directly or by causing acute allergic interstitial
nephritis.
Other potential etiologies:
Patients should be carefully questioned for other symptoms of systemic
diseases.
Severe myalgias, dark urine (with or without decreased urine output),
and appropriate clinical scenarios (exercise, crush injury, recent surgery,
drug or alcohol use, medications, immobilization, and so forth) may point
toward rhabdomyolysis.
Arthralgias, arthritis, skin rash, oral ulcers, hair loss, and significant
cytopenias in the past may suggest the possibility of a connective tissue
disorder (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus).
Sinusitis, cough, and hemoptysis may suggest diseases such as
Wegener’s granulomatosis or Goodpasture syndrome.
A history of recent sore throats or significant skin infections may suggest
acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
195

Bone pain and anemia may suggest underlying multiple myeloma.
Also important is a history of chronic liver disease. If cirrhosis is present,
assess the severity and degree of compensation of cirrhosis of the liver.
Hepatorenal syndrome is a devastating complication usually seen with
advanced, decompensated liver disease.
Patients with ascites are prone to develop spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis that can lead to sepsis and ATN.
Any history suggestive of purpura must alert the clinician to the
possibility of cryoglobulinemia (especially in a patient with hepatitis
C), or Henoch–Shonlein purpura or other vasculitis.
Risk factors:
Appraisal of a patient’s comorbidities may identify a handicapped
autoregulatory system.
For example, in decompensated heart failure, a patient’s increased
sympathetic tone may cause an increased susceptibility to nephrotoxic
radiocontrast.
Similarly, the presence of hypertension, diabetes, or significant
peripheral vascular disease should also raise the possibility of
dysfunctional microvasculature due to increased atherosclerotic burden,
intimal hyperplasia, and decreased arterial capacitance.
Physical Examination
Volume status:
Determination of the patient’s volume status by a thorough
examination is an absolute prerequisite in the examination of the renal
patient.
Check the patient’s pulse and blood pressure. If blood pressure is normal
or high, evaluate for orthostatic hypotension in the sitting and standing
196

positions, paying careful attention to the pulse as well.
Assess for jugular venous distention and edema.
Mucous membranes and skin turgor need to be checked for assessment of
hydration.
Cardiac exam:
This should focus on the location and character of apical impulse,
presence of S3 (volume overload) or S4 (pressure overload), and

functional regurgitant murmurs suggesting valve ring dilatation because
of volume overload.
The presence of dyspnea and tachypnea suggest fluid overload. Acidosis
may induce Kussmaul respiration, but this deep-sighing character is not to
be confused with the dyspnea of pulmonary edema.
Inspiratory crackles at the lung bases occur in pulmonary edema.
Abdominal examination:
Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and ascites can occur due to passive
congestion in fluid-overload states.
The liver may be pulsatile if volume overload has resulted in severe
functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Exclude obstruction by assessing bladder distention, performing a
prostate exam, and placing a Foley catheter if indicated.
Other systemic signs:
Rash (e.g., vasculitis, atheroemboli, interstitial nephritis, lupus), arthritis
(e.g., vasculitis, connective tissue disorders), pulmonary hemorrhage
(vasculitis, lupus) can also provide diagnostic clues.
Large lower extremity muscle groups tender to palpation may alert the
physician to a developing compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis.
197

A complete and thorough examination is required in addition to the
above to elicit possible causes of the AKI, to assess the degree of
compensation, and to detect features suggestive of uremic syndrome.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Examination of urine:
Urinalysis and microscopic examination of the urine sediment by a
trained physician is probably the most important test in the evaluation
of AKI.
The urinalysis should be bland, not reveal protein, blood, cells, or casts
in prerenal azotemia and in uncomplicated postrenal failure, unless there
is underlying chronic kidney disease.
The urinalysis and sediment may help to not only separate renal causes
from pre- and postrenal etiologies but also to differentiate between a
tubular, glomerular, or interstitial process (Table 11-2).
If the urine dipstick tests strongly positive for blood but no red blood
cells are seen, myoglobinuria or hemoglobinuria should be suspected,
suggesting rhabdomyolysis or severe intravascular hemolysis leading to
AKI.

198

It must be kept in mind that in certain diseases that affect the
preglomerular blood vessels, such as thrombotic microangiopathies (e.g.,
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic-uremic syndrome),
the urine sediment may be bland despite a bona fide renal etiology.
The overall clinical presentation must therefore always be kept in mind.
Indeed, the urine can be bland despite the diagnosis of ischemic ATN.
This is typical in the elderly patients with underlying dilated
cardiomyopathy. Details of various types of casts and interpretations can
be found in Chapter 1.
Urinary indices:
In oliguric AKI, the differentiation of prerenal failure from ATN is critical
in guiding the decision to restrict or resuscitate the fluid.
Various parameters in the urine have been evaluated to make such a
differentiation. The basic principle of these parameters is fairly uniform:
In the face of diminished perfusion, the intact renal parenchyma
tries to conserve as much sodium as possible to restore extracellular
fluid volume and, hence, renal perfusion. Thus, the urine is very
concentrated and allows excretion of very little sodium.
However, once the renal parenchyma is damaged, the tubules lose their
ability to concentrate the urine and to conserve sodium. It must be kept
199

in mind that these indices are usually not useful in nonoliguric states.
Some of these indices are presented in Table 11-3.
FENa = [(urine Na/plasma Na)/(urine creatinine/plasma
creatinine)] × 100
Although fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is useful in distinguishing
prerenal AKI from ATN, its sensitivity diminishes in the setting of diuretic
use.
FEUrea = [(urine urea nitrogen/blood urea nitrogen)/(urine
creatinine/plasma creatinine)] × 100
FEUrea calculation takes advantage of urea transporters that are not
altered by loop diuretic action, with a sensitivity near 85%, specificity of
92%, and positive predictive value of 98%. FEUrea >50 is consistent
with ATN; <35 is consistent with prerenal injury.
Blood counts and coagulation screen:
Review of the blood counts and screening tests for coagulation
abnormalities may provide extremely valuable information about
underlying disease processes leading to AKI.

A peripheral smear must be examined where indicated. The presence of
schistocytes in cases of AKI suggests thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and disseminated intravascular
coagulation as possible etiologies. Rarely, schistocytes can also be seen in
200

conditions with severe renal vasculitis, such as diffuse lupus nephritis.
Chemistry panel:
Review of laboratory values, including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,
electrolytes, and acid-base balance, is essential to establishing the
previous baseline and trend leading to the current abnormality.
If severe metabolic acidosis is present, anion and osmolar gaps should
be evaluated so as to not miss a severe metabolic derangement or toxic
ingestion causing the AKI.
Elevated plasma blood urea nitrogen out of proportion to sCr
(>20:1) should prompt an investigation of gastrointestinal bleeding,
recent use of high-dose corticosteroids, leading to protein breakdown, or
parenteral or enteral high-protein feeding.
In rhabdomyolysis, profound hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia (due
to release from damaged myocytes), hypocalcemia (due to calciumphosphorus binding), and a disproportionate elevation of the creatinine
in relation to blood urea nitrogen may develop. Creatinine kinase (CK)
elevation happens within 12 hours after the injury, and the rise is in
proportion to the severity and extent of the muscle injury. Kidney injury
has been reported with CK levels >5000 IU/L, but is typically seen with
values >25,000 IU/L.
Imaging
Assessment of obstruction should be given high priority in the patient
presenting to emergency room with AKI.
Renal ultrasound is readily available and extremely accurate in
excluding urinary tract obstruction as a cause of AKI.
Ultrasonography is useful in delineating renal sizes and echo texture
and should be obtained early in the workup of AKI in patients presenting
to the emergency room or hospital with hyperkalemia after a foley
catheter has been placed.
201

However, in the intensive care setting, where obstruction is an unlikely
cause of AKI, the yield from ultrasound is very low and it should not be
ordered routinely.
An ultrasound can provide false-negative results in the setting of
profound volume depletion as well as in cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis,
in which dilatation of calyces and ureters may not occur.
Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are
alternative modalities to rule out obstruction due to microcalculi or a
fibrotic process, in cases where dilatation of calyces may not be seen on
ultrasound.
Diagnotic Procedures
Serologic profile and special tests:
In situations suggestive of intrinsic renal disease, various serologic tests
(Table 11-4) are indicated to delineate the etiology. These tests are
discussed in detail in other chapters covering vasculitis, lupus nephritis,
and intrinsic causes of AKI.

202

Tissue diagnosis:
Renal biopsy is usually not required to establish the diagnosis of ATN.
However, if the cause of AKI is not apparent, or if there is a suspicion of
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, then renal histology is
required to make a diagnosis and aid in management.
This must be done in a timely fashion, as certain disease processes
irreversibly destroy renal parenchyma if they are not treated
expeditiously.
In cases of suspected acute interstitial nephritis with a clear inciting
agent, discontinuation of the agent and observation of the renal function
can be chosen over a kidney biopsy, especially in high-risk patients.
In cases of suspected glomerulonephritis (based on historical features,
urine abnormalities, and blood and serologic tests), a renal biopsy is
necessary before immunosuppressive therapy is instituted. For instance,
203

even when diagnosis of lupus nephritis is obvious, most nephrologists
obtain a tissue diagnosis to correctly define and classify the disease, and
to outline progression and future therapy options.
Newer biomarkers:
There is great interest in the development of newer serum and urine
markers for early diagnosis of AKI, as SCr is neither a true biomarker nor
an early marker of disease.
SCr slowly identifies renal injury and does so indirectly, because it is
derived from muscle filaments and not kidney structure.
An ideal biomarker would instead reflect actual cellular injury derived
from the kidney (like troponin for myocardial infarction), and detect such
injury within hours of the event.
If therapy can be started in the early stages of AKI (initiation phase),
then this can potentially prevent the continued deterioration of renal
function.
Promising biomarkers include serum and urine neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin, which increases as early as 1 hour after coronary
artery bypass grafting in patients who later develop AKI.12
Interleukin-18 has also shown similar results, including in the setting of
delayed graft function after kidney transplantation.13
Other molecules of interest include cystatin C and kidney injury
molecule-1. Further studies are underway to determine if any of these
markers will enhance the diagnostic utility of creatinine in AKI.

TREATMENT
Management of AKI depends on the underlying etiology and will be
discussed under each category.
However, some uniform guidelines that are noted below cover all
204

diagnoses.
Avoidance of additional nephrotoxic agents and further hypotension
can hasten renal recovery.
Acid-base and electrolyte disturbances:
Hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis are frequently encountered in
AKI. The individual management of these conditions is discussed
elsewhere. In the setting of AKI, these two conditions are the foremost
reasons to initiate RRT.
Nutritional support:
Nutrition is one of the important facets of supportive care.
AKI is a stressful, catabolic state, and adequate nutrition is essential with
enteral or parenteral support and should be initiated in a timely manner.
Unlike CKD, where protein restriction is recommended, protein
requirements in AKI vary from 1.0 g/kg (prior to dialysis initiation or
during hemodialysis) to 2.5 g/kg (in continuous RRT).
Dose adjustment of medications:
Adjusting doses of concurrent medications to the renal function is
essential in preventing further renal injury as well as avoiding
systemic toxicity.
Even seemingly innocuous medications such as magnesium-containing
antacids and phosphorus-containing enemas (Fleets®) can be damaging
in the setting of renal dysfunction.
Various guidelines are available to make recommended dose adjustments
for the level of renal function. The pharmacist is also a valuable resource
in making medication adjustments in renal failure.
If the patient requires initiation of hemodialysis or continuous RRT, then
dose adjustments are again necessary in some cases to ensure adequate
205

drug levels.
The criteria for initiation of RRT are noted in Chapter 15, Renal
Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury.

REVIEW OF ACUTE TUBULAR NECROSIS
ATN refers to the AKI resulting from ischemic or toxic injury to the
tubules. The common etiologies of ATN are detailed in Table 11-5.
Several disease processes contribute to the overall prevalence of AKI in
the tertiary care setting.
The most commonly studied scenarios include sepsis, cardiothoracic
surgery, iodine-based radiocontrast, and nephrotoxic medications.14
Three major components that comprise the diverse pathophysiology of
AKI include ischemia, inflammation, and direct tubular damage.15,16
The natural history of ATN progresses through four phases:
Initiation refers to an early phase in which ischemia leads to cell injury.
Extension refers to the phase in which tubular cell polarity is disrupted
with a loss of viable and damaged cells into the urinary space, causing
tubular casts with obstruction and backleak. Electrolyte transport across
the tubular brush border is deranged.
During the maintenance phase, the cells undergo dedifferentiation,
fibroblast migration, and proliferation, and result in fully established
renal failure.
In the recovery phase, stem cells repopulate the tubular epithelium and
cell polarity is slowly restored, allowing for an incremental capacity to
shuttle solute across the brush border in a physiologic manner.
All of these phases may not be clinically obvious and one may progress
to the next rapidly.
206

In oliguric patients, an osmotic diuresis may be seen in the recovery
phase (post-ATN diuresis), and meticulous attention should be paid to
fluid balance and electrolyte replacement.

ATN can last from days to several weeks in patients with baseline normal
renal function, with the potential for renal recovery even after weeks of
oliguria.
Of the patients with ATN, ∼90% can regain sufficient renal function to
discontinue dialysis, if they had baseline normal renal function.
However, these patients are at a higher risk of developing CKD and endstage renal disease and need to be followed closely.17
Pathophysiology of Ischemic Kidney Injury
Ischemic ATN in many circumstances is a progression or persistence of
the prerenal condition that leads to structural damage of the
tubular epithelium.
Although 25% of the cardiac output flows into the renal circulation, most
of the blood flow is relegated to the cortex, and the medulla is
maintained in a relative hypoxic state.
The S3 segment of the proximal tubule is especially vulnerable in
207

ischemic states and most of the damage occurs in this segment.
Overwhelming levels of angiotensin II, endothelin-1, and circulating
catecholamines cause intense intrarenal vasoconstriction, overcoming the
protective effects of prostaglandins and nitric oxide.18,19
Other factors also come into play: The ischemic response stimulates
release of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn leads to increased
expression of adhesion molecules on the leukocytes and their ligands on
the endothelium. This environment results in increased leukocyteendothelium adhesion and endothelial injury.
Congestion and obstruction of capillaries in the outer medulla causes
persistent medullary ischemia.
Tubular cell damage begins with a aberrant trafficking of integrin
proteins and ion-transport channels, which leads to loss of cellular
voltage gradients, detachment of the epithelial brush border, and
disengagement of the epithelial basement membrane.15
Disruption of membrane transport proteins with continued perturbation
of cellular metabolism causes tubular backleak and further loss of
glomerular
filtration rate (GFR).
The cumulative effect of these insults is apoptosis or, in some cases, frank
necrosis.
Nephrotoxic Injury
Various endogenous and exogenous toxins can lead to tubular damage
and AKI. A list of some of the important toxins is presented in Table 11-5.
Contrast-induced nephropathy is discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
Rhabdomyolysis, a frequently encountered nephrotoxic injury, is
described below.
Rhabdomyolysis
208

Destruction of skeletal myocytes releases cytosolic contents (potassium,
phosphorus, myoglobin, CK) into extracellular space and systemic
circulation.
The incidence of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is reported to be between 10%
and 50%. In cases of traumatic rhabdomyolysis, the incidence of AKI is as
high as 85%.
The common causes include immobilization (e.g., alcoholic patient or
patient with seizures or stroke; patient found at home after a fall; or
postsurgery patients with large muscle mass or obesity, or undergoing
urological or bariatric surgeries), trauma (gunshot wound with vascular
compromise, motor vehicle accidents, crush injury following earthquakes
or building collapse), or extreme exertion (exercise in severe heat, new
recruits at army camps, and so forth). Other causes include cocaine use,
medications like statins, and hypophosphatemia.
Vasoconstriction plays a major role in nephrotoxicity associated with
unbound myoglobin.20 Dimeric heme proteins can have direct cytotoxic
effect on tubular epithelial cells; the mechanism remains ill defined.
Renal ischemia is believed to result from activation of endothelin
receptors as well as scavenging of nitric oxide. Myoglobin is also believed
to generate free radicals that can induce oxidative injury to the tubules.
This may be inhibited in an alkaline pH.
Management of ATN
Ischemia-induced AKI occurs in many different clinical scenarios.
Recommendations for therapy in any given case have to be tailored
according to the clinical circumstances.
Here, we present a broad and basic framework of therapy. The
management of other individual causes is presented in relevant chapters
elsewhere.
Restoration of Effective Circulatory Volume

209

Restoration of effective circulatory volume is one of the crucial
aspects of management in patients with ischemic renal injury.
The initial fluid of choice is a crystalloid solution, such as normal
saline in most situations, administered until euvolemia is restored.
Theoretical benefit of colloid such as albumin, gelatin, and dextrans
outside the operating room are often outweighed by complications such
as coagulopathy, anaphylactoid reactions, heart failure, and renal
failure.21
Fluids must be administered with caution in oliguric AKI in order to
avoid volume overload and subsequent heart failure or respiratory
failure.
If fluid resuscitation is not successful in improving blood pressure,
inotropic or pressor agents may be needed.
In the special circumstance of rhabdomyolysis, early volume repletion
is essential in preventing AKI.22
Initially normal saline should be infused at a rate of 1 to 2 L in the first
hour and then continued at 150 to 300 mL/h, depending on the urine
output and the patient’s volume status.
Sodium bicarbonate infusions are not recommended and can have
deleterious effects if acid-base status is not monitored closely—especially
in the setting of hypocalcemia—given the risk of increased calcium
binding in the setting of alkalosis.23,24
Anuric or oliguric AKI signals extensive tubular injury and requires a
downward titration of IV fluids.
Early initiation of RRT should be considered in anuric or oliguric
patients, given the risk of life-threatening hyperkalemia with ongoing
muscle damage.
Withdrawal and Avoidance of Nephrotoxins
210

It is extremely important to avoid further injury to the suffering kidney.
Contrast media should be avoided wherever possible.
NSAIDs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin 2
receptor blockers should be held.
Nonnephrotoxic antibiotics should be prescribed whenever possible.
If a potentially toxic antibiotic usage is unavoidable, the dose should be
carefully adjusted, and drug levels should be closely monitored; if
possible, pharmacokinetic principles should be applied (e.g.,
aminoglycosides).
Diuretics
The diuretic challenge is often used in patients with oliguric AKI, in an
attempt to convert them to a nonoliguric state. This may be helpful in the
management of the patient with regard to hyperkalemia and
hypervolemia.
Diuretics do not improve survival or hasten renal function recovery
in AKI.
Theoretically, diuretics discourage cellular debris from obstructing the
tubular lumen because of enhanced urinary volume. However, little
evidence exists that forced diuresis can mitigate the intraparenchymal
obstructive process.
The use of diuretics to convert from an oliguric to nonoliguric state
should not sway the physician away from early nephrology consultation
or institution of RRT in a timely fashion.
If diuretics are used, then doses utilized must be high enough to
reach the loop of Henle in order to be effective in the setting of reduced
GFR. For example, with a GFR of <30 mL/min, a 160 to 200 mg IV bolus
of furosemide might be needed.
If there is a diuretic response, then it can be continued as intermittent
211

doses or as a continuous infusion. Studies have not shown a difference in
outcome with either method.
Volume status should be ascertained carefully prior to and during
diuretic administration, to avoid intravascular volume depletion.
Renal Replacement Therapy
RRT is the mainstay of care for unremitting AKI. Details regarding the
different modes of dialysis for treatment of AKI are discussed in Chapter
15.
Experimental Agents for the Treatment of AKI
Several medications have been investigated in clinical trials, but none
are approved for use in the prevention or treatment of AKI.
Dopamine has vasodilatory and diuretic properties; however, it offers
no clinical response at low dose and causes severe hypotension at high
doses.25
Fenoldopam is a dopamine-1 receptor agonist that has selective activity
in the kidney vasculature, but also causes systemic hypotension, negating
its renal benefit. In high-risk patients, fenoldopam may have benefit if it
can be administered in a directed fashion to the renal vasculature,26 but
this is not practiced routinely.
Anaritide initially failed to show efficacy in the setting of heart failure;
however, by tailoring administration to the high-risk patient population
in the cardiothoracic ICU, the drug has demonstrated selective benefit.27
The difficulty of treating established AKI has generated interest in the
study of prophylactic agents. The following medications were
evaluated in phase III clinical trials for AKI in select settings but are
not recommended as standard therapy.
Iloprost, a prostacyclin analog, has vasodilatory effect on the renal
medulla and has been shown to reduce the incidence of AKI in high-risk
212

patients undergoing radiologic studies enhanced with iodinated
radiocontrast.28 This drug’s benefit is yet to be confirmed in patients who
participated in the US healthcare system.
Rolofylline, an adenosine-1 receptor antagonist, was not effective in the
treatment of patients with cardiorenal physiology. However, the selected
clinical trial design has been criticized for not administering the drug as a
continuous infusion and assessment of benefit before the drug was
metabolized.29
Most of clinical trials evaluating therapeutic agents in the setting of ATN
have been hampered by the lack of an early biomarker. Several studies
are underway to find an ideal renal biomarker, which hopefully will pave
the way to find therapeutic strategies for ATN.

Prerenal and Postrenal Acute
Kidney Injury
Judy L. Jang and Anitha Vijayan

PRERENAL KIDNEY DISEASE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Prerenal azotemia is the most common cause of acute kidney injury
(AKI). Rapid restoration of effective circulatory volume usually leads to
prompt and complete resolution of AKI.
A complete examination of the urine, including the sediment, in addition
to a thorough history and physical examination exam is essential in
ascertaining the accurate diagnosis.
Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is useful in the oliguric state only.
Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) may be a useful marker to

distinguish prerenal AKI from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting
of diuretic use.
Definition
Prerenal kidney injury is characterized by a state in which renal
parenchymal function is preserved and is responding appropriately to
diminished perfusion. Because the integrity of the renal parenchymal
tissue is preserved, timely restoration of perfusion and glomerular
ultrafiltration pressure should correct glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
There is a continuum from compensated renal hypoperfusion, without a
217

change in GFR, to prerenal injury with reduced GFR to ischemic ATN.1,2
Epidemiology
Prerenal azotemia has been described as the cause of AKI in 30% to 70%
of community-associated kidney injury and up to 30% of hospitalassociated kidney injury, depending on various patient populations.3
Etiology
The important causes of prerenal AKI are summarized in Table 12-1.
These include:
Intravascular volume depletion
Decreased effective circulating volume
Renal vasoconstriction (e.g., sepsis, hypercalcemia, liver disease, and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], cyclooxygenase 2 [COX2] inhibitors)
Pharmacologic agents that impair autoregulation and GFR (e.g., efferent
arteriolar vasodilatation due to angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors [ACEIs] or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers [ARBs]).1

218

There are factors that limit the ability of renal autoregulation to
maintain homeostasis.
Under normal circumstances, the kidney may be able to preserve
function despite significantly low perfusion pressures.
Renal function may decompensate at relatively higher mean arterial
pressures in patients with limited ability to maintain afferent arteriolar
dilatation due to preexisting large or small vessel disease (e.g.,
atherosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy). Thus, an elderly patient being
treated with ACEIs could suffer from prerenal azotemia, even with
relatively modest decreases in blood pressure.
219

FIGURE 12-1. Algorithm for prerenal azotemia. ADH, antidiuretic
hormone; BP, blood pressure; BUN, blood urea nitrogen; NO, nitric
oxide; PG, prostaglandin; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
system; SCr, serum creatinine;
TGFB, tubuloglomerular feedback.
Pathophysiology
The hallmark of the prerenal state is decreased perfusion of the
kidney. There are immediate systemic and renal compensatory
responses, recruiting multiple neurohumoral systems, directed at
maintaining blood flow and GFR. The cascade of events discussed below
is depicted in Figure 12-1.
The adrenergic system functions to maintain blood pressure.
A decrease in blood pressure leads to increased sympathetic activity,
resulting in increased peripheral vascular resistance. Thereby, cardiac
output increases, leading to restoration of perfusion pressure.
Negative repercussions to the kidneys may result, as renal
220

vasoconstriction due to sympathetic drive may cause decreased renal
blood flow (RBF).
Sympathetic activity also stimulates release of renin through betaadrenergic receptors.
Renal autoregulation maintains a constant level of RBF despite
fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. It is based on two mechanisms, the
myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback.
A function of smooth muscle contraction in response to external
stretching force, the myogenic response, causes afferent arteriolar
constriction or dilation on rises or falls in arterial pressure.
Tubuloglomerular feedback leads to afferent arteriolar dilatation
when the macula densa in the early distal tubule senses low solute
delivery.4
Maintenance of GFR through falling perfusion pressures stems from the
ability to independently maneuver the afferent and efferent
arterioles. As flow increases because of afferent arteriolar relaxation,
glomerular pressure is maintained through efferent arteriolar
constriction, mediated through the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
(RAAS).
The RAAS is critical in renal self-defense.
With decreased renal perfusion, renin is released from the
juxtaglomerular cells and leads ultimately to the formation of angiotensin
II (AII).
AII has a variety of effects:
It produces arteriolar vasoconstriction.
It leads to enhanced renal tubular sodium reabsorption by direct
stimulation of transport in the early proximal tubule and increased
release of aldosterone by the adrenal gland.
221

It exerts complex effects on glomerular hemodynamics. With modest
hypotension or congestive heart failure (CHF), AII can preserve GFR by
its preferential vasoconstrictive action on the efferent arteriole.
Efferent arteriolar constriction causes increased intraglomerular pressure,
thus maintaining the filtration fraction. With increasing AII activity, the
afferent arteriole also starts to constrict, leading to decreased filtration.5
Blocking this effect of AII with ACEIs or ARBs leads to an earlier and
more marked fall in GFR.
It generates nitric oxide release and stimulates production of vasodilator
prostaglandins, particularly prostacyclin, which protect the afferent
arteriole from vasoconstrictive influences.6,7 This interaction leads to
early decompensation of renal function in patients using NSAIDs due to
loss of prostacyclin production.
It increases release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior
pituitary. Mainly stimulated by volume depletion and hyperosmolality,
ADH acts to exert maximal water conservation and excretion of
concentrated urine. Acting through the V1-receptors, it also causes

vasoconstriction and increased peripheral resistance and blood pressure.
Because of these autoregulatory mechanisms, renal function is able to be
maintained even under conditions of diminished effective volume.
If, however, the effective circulatory volume continues to decrease, the
renal compensatory mechanisms may be overwhelmed, as the afferent
arteriolar vasodilatation is no longer adequate to maintain flow.
Should the levels of AII become overwhelming, vasoconstriction will
occur in the renal vasculature. RBF will subsequently decrease, as will
urine output, resulting in a state of prerenal azotemia.5
The blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine levels will start to rise as
the kidney strives to hold onto water and salt through persistent tubular
action. If this sequence is not reversed quickly, the parenchyma will no
longer remain intact and the patient may suffer ischemic ATN.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Signs and symptoms of prerenal kidney injury are usually very subtle
and patients are frequently asymptomatic.
Careful monitoring of urine output for oliguria (<400 to 500 mL/d) is
critical in identifying and reversing oliguric prerenal kidney injury.
The diagnosis of prerenal AKI ultimately rests on a combination of
clinical findings and laboratory testing.
History
A detailed history of events causing alterations in volume status should
be sought.
A history of lightheadedness or orthostatic instability may point toward
intravascular depletion.
Hemorrhage, diarrhea, polyuria, and situations leading to excessive
insensitive losses (e.g., fever or diminished intake due to dysphagia) all
predispose to volume depletion.
Weight gain, edema, or periorbital swelling may signify fluid retention
in the extravascular space.
A review of the patient’s records should be conducted for episodes of
blood pressure swings. For postoperative patients, it is essential to review
intra- and postoperative hemodynamic records for hypotension.
Obtain history of urinary symptoms and trends. Intake and output charts,
as well as weight records, of a hospitalized patient should be carefully
reviewed.
Elicit preexisting underlying factors (e.g., CHF, hypertension, or diabetes
mellitus) that may adversely affect ability to exercise maximum
autoregulation.
223

A thorough review of medications should be conducted, with specific
focus on nephrotoxic medications that can induce glomerular
hypoperfusion (e.g., NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, ACEIs, ARBs, calcineurin
inhibitors, and so forth).
Physical Examination
Pulse rate and blood pressure should be measured in supine and standing
positions in patients with suspected volume depletion.
Mucous membranes and skin turgor need to be checked for assessment of
degree of hydration.
The presence of jugular venous distention and edema suggest volume
overload. The location and character of the apical impulse, presence of
S3 (volume overload) or S4 (pressure overload), and presence of
functional regurgitant murmurs should be carefully discerned. Dyspnea,
tachypnea, and crackles can occur with pulmonary edema.
Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and ascites can occur because of passive
congestion in fluid overload states.
Diagnostic Testing
Additional procedures such as central venous pressure or pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure measurement might be required if volume status
is not apparent from a thorough history and physical examination.8
Urinalysis in prerenal kidney injury is often characterized as “bland,”
with no protein or blood seen. Typically, hyaline casts can be seen under
magnification.2
Urine indices in the oliguric state, such as the FENa and the FEUrea, are
useful but imperfect tools to help differentiate the prerenal state from
ATN. In oliguric AKI, the differentiation of prerenal failure from ATN is
critical to guide appropriate management.
In prerenal AKI, the FENa is <1%, in the absence of diuretic use. In
224

one study, the FENa was low in only 48% of diuretic-treated patients with
prerenal azotemia.9

Urea absorption by the proximal tubule is increased in prerenal states,10
leading to a FEUrea of <35%. Given that most diuretics used clinically
work at distal sites, FEUrea should not be affected by their use and is
therefore a valuable clinical measure in the setting of diuretic use.
Though the positive predictive value of FEUrea is 98%, FEUrea values in
chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been standardized, so caution
must be used.

Interpretations of urine indices must be made in conjunction with other
assessments of the patient, because there are clinically important
exceptions to these generalizations. For instance, patients with certain
types of ATN, such as contrast-induced renal injury, rhabdomyolysis,
sepsis, wherein vasoconstriction plays a key role, may present FENa rates

<1%, despite having tubular injury. Acute glomerulonephritis can also
present with low FENa, but urinalysis will reveal hematuria, proteinuria
and presence of red blood cells, and sometimes, casts.

TREATMENT
The treatment of prerenal AKI should be expeditious to avoid ischemia
to the renal tubules and ATN.
Restoration of Effective Circulatory Volume
The fundamental problem in most cases of prerenal azotemia is
diminished effective circulatory volume. Prompt and effective restoration
improves RBF, leading to increased GFR and improvement or
normalization of renal function.
In most cases of prerenal injury, administration of intravenous fluids is
the mainstay of therapy.
The initial fluid of choice is administration of a crystalloid solution to
225

restore the euvolemic state. Normal saline is usually the most effective
choice.
Alternatives include colloid solutions such as albumin, gelatin, and
dextrans. However, anaphylactoid reactions, coagulopathy, and
precipitation of oliguria and AKI may sometimes be seen with these
agents.11
Treatment of Underlying Causes
In patients with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), the underlying hepatic
dysfunction needs to be reversed either with recovery of the injured liver
(e.g., acetaminophen overdose) or with liver transplantation.
Correction of compromised cardiac output may involve preload and
afterload reduction and diuresis or appropriate use of inotropic agents,
vasodilators, or other means to maintain blood pressure and perfusion.
The HRS and cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) are discussed below.
In patients with sepsis, immediate intervention with broad-spectrum
intravenous antibiotics and pressor support will help stabilize blood
pressure and improve renal perfusion.
Medications such as diuretics or those interfering with the RAAS pathway
should be discontinued without delay. Other medications that should be
discontinued include NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors
should be handled with caution, as sudden discontinuation in a patient
with organ transplant can precipitate rejection. However, levels should
be closely monitored and should be maintained in the recommended
therapeutic range.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Hepatorenal Syndrome
HRS is the most frequent cause of renal dysfunction in patients with
cirrhosis.
226

Two types of HRS were originally defined by the International Ascites
Club.12,13
Type 1 HRS presents as rapid and progressive impairment of renal
function defined by a doubling of the initial serum creatinine to a level
>2.5 mg/dL (220 μmol/L) or a 50% reduction of the initial 24-hour
creatinine clearance to a level <20 mL/min in <2 weeks. This is
associated with a dismal prognosis.
Type 2 HRS presents as impairment in renal function with serum
creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dL (132 μmol/L) that does not meet criteria
for type 1 HRS. Type 2 HRS develops gradually over weeks and is
associated with a better survival.
Renal vasoconstriction is the main hemodynamic derangement that
defines HRS.
The main variable responsible for these hemodynamic changes is portal
in the setting of cirrhosis, causing a splanchnic arterial vasodilation. This
vasodilation occurs mainly because of the production of nitric oxide as a
consequence of endothelial stretching and possibly bacterial
translocation.12
The accumulation of plasma volume in the splanchnic bed causes a
compensatory response because of decreased central blood volume with
activation of systemic vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic systems (RAAS,
sympathetic system, ADH). This accounts for the sodium and water
retention, as well as renal vasoconstriction, as the kidney senses a
relative hypovolemic state.
Recent studies suggest that the development of HRS may also be due, in
part, to reduction in cardiac output.
HRS occurs in ∼10% of hospitalized patients who have cirrhosis and
ascites. In addition, the probability of developing HRS in patients who
had cirrhosis and ascites was 18% at 1 year and increased to 39% at 5
years.14

227

Individuals who develop HRS most often exhibit clinical features of
advanced cirrhosis along with low arterial blood pressure, low urine
volume, and severe urinary sodium retention (urine sodium <10 mEq/L).
Dilutional hyponatremia is almost universally found.
Elevated serum creatinine levels define HRS. However, these levels
usually are lower than those seen in noncirrhotic patients who have AKI
because
of reduced muscle mass and low endogenous production of creatinine in
cirrhosis.
Suggested diagnostic criteria for HRS include13,15:
Acute or chronic hepatic disease with advanced hepatic failure and
portal hypertension.
Low GFR, as indicated by plasma creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dL or 132
μmol/L.
Exclusion of other apparent causes for renal failure, such as shock (sepsis
or hypovolemia), volume depletion, use of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g.,
NSAIDs), and obstruction.
No improvement in renal function despite withdrawal of diuretics and
volume challenge with intravenous albumin.
The only definitive cure for HRS is recovery of hepatic function either
with liver transplantation or spontaneous recovery of the diseased
liver.
Temporizing measures can provide a bridge to liver transplantation or
recovery.
The combination of drugs to induce splanchnic vasoconstriction
(octreotide) and renal vasodilation (midodrine) has been beneficial in
improving renal function in HRS.16
Even though intravenous albumin appears to augment the response to
these agents, its use remains controversial. However, in the setting of
228

large-volume paracentesis, intravenous albumin should be administered
to prevent renal dysfunction, especially in the setting of spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis.
Alternatively, vasopressin analogs (e.g., terlipressin), which can also
cause splanchnic vasoconstriction along with renal vasodilation, can be
used instead of the combination.17 The limitation of terlipressin is its
unavailability in many countries, including the United States.
The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is another
potential modality of therapy for HRS. A self-expandable metal stent is
inserted between the hepatic vein and the intrahepatic portion of the
portal vein using a transjugular approach, with a resulting decrease in
portal pressure. It is primarily reserved for treatment of variceal bleeding
and refractory ascites, although small studies have suggested some
improvement in renal function.18
Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) is a modified form of
dialysis using albumin-containing dialysate that is recirculated and
perfused online through charcoal and anion exchanger columns, and
enables the removal of water-soluble and albumin-bound substances. It is
believed that this system removes some of the vasoactive substances that
mediate the hemodynamic changes that lead to HRS, thereby improving
systemic hemodynamics and renal perfusion. Short-term studies suggest
survival benefit with MARS in HRS, but larger studies are required before
this expensive therapy can be widely recommended.19 It is not approved
for use in the United States.
Hemodialysis is extremely controversial in HRS. Generally, hemodialysis
is usually offered only if the patient is awaiting liver transplantation or
there is a chance of liver recovery. In the absence of these possibilities,
dialysis adds little to overall survival in this condition.
Cardiorenal Syndrome
The coexistence of renal and cardiac dysfunction, in which acute or
chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic
dysfunction in the other organ, has been termed CRS.
229

A classification of CRS with five subtypes has been proposed that reflects
the bidirectional nature of the heart and kidney interaction, the
timeframe, and the pathophysiology20:
CRS Type 1: rapid worsening of cardiac function results in AKI
CRS Type 2: chronic worsening of cardiac function causes progressive
CKD
CRS Type 3: abrupt and primary worsening of renal function (e.g., AKI,
ischemia, glomerulonephritis) leads to acute cardiac dysfunction (e.g.,
CHF, arrhythmia, ischemia)
CRS Type 4: primary CKD contributes to cardiac dysfunction (e.g.,
ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, increased risk of adverse
cardiovascular events)
CRS Type 5: acute or chronic systemic disorders cause both cardiac and
renal dysfunction
The classical CRS seen in the hospital setting is Type 1 CRS and the
discussion below will focus only on this condition.
Renal insufficiency is found in 30% to 40% of patients admitted to the
hospital for heart failure.21
The pathophysiology of CRS Type 1 involves interconnected
hemodynamic and neurohormonal mechanisms.
Impaired cardiac output in heart failure causes renal arterial underfilling
and increased venous pressure. In response, neurohormonal sympathetic
activation occurs and increases systemic vasoconstriction, leading to a
reduction in GFR. This, in turn, activates the RAAS, which generates more
AII, aldosterone, endothelin-1, and ADH, in an attempt to maintain
euvolemia through fluid retention, vasoconstriction, or both.22
The activity of these systems remains elevated over the long term in
patients with heart failure, resulting in systemic and pulmonary
230

congestion, a hallmark of CRS.
Features of CRS Type 1 include low systolic blood pressure, tendency for
hyperkalemia, diuretic resistance, and anemia. Preexisting renal
dysfunction as well as other risk factors such as hypertension and
diabetes mellitus may contribute to worsening renal failure and poor
outcome associated with decompensated cardiac disease.23,24
The management of the CRS remains a challenge in spite of advances
in medical therapy.
In the setting of overt volume overload, large doses of loop diuretics
(e.g., furosemide 120 to 200 mg) may need to be administered
intravenously to achieve a desirable diuresis.
For synergy, thiazide diuretics or analogs (e.g. metolazone) should be
added, to block sodium absorption in the distal convoluted tubule and
increase natriuresis.
Small studies have shown that nitrates allow for decreased doses of
diuretics.
Inotropic agents have been used successfully in the cardiogenic shock
stage but need further evaluation with lesser degrees of cardiac failure.
Nesiritide, a potent vasodilator, has been used to rapidly reduce cardiac
filling pressures and improve dyspnea in patients with heart failure.
However, nesiritide should be used with caution, as deterioration of renal
function has been seen in some cases.25
Hemofiltration, though shown to be beneficial in achieving faster fluid
removal in small trials, is invasive and expensive. Larger, multicenter
evaluations are needed before its use can be widely recommended.
Anemia should be treated with judicious use of intravenous iron,
erythropoietic-stimulating agents and blood transfusion, as correction of
anemia has been shown to decrease rehospitalizations and improve
quality of life in heart failure patients.
231

POSTRENAL KIDNEY DISEASE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Obstructive uropathy should be considered in patients with decreased or
absent urine output, change in voiding pattern, unexplained renal
insufficiency, or pain suggesting urinary tract distension.
Ultrasound is a cost-effective and efficient way to evaluate for urinary
tract obstruction (UTO).
The degree of obstruction may be underestimated in severely dehydrated
patients. In such cases, repeating the ultrasound after adequate volume
replacement may highlight the hydronephrosis.
Rarely, in cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis or lymphomas, the ureters are
encased and hydronephrosis is not seen despite severe UTO.
UTO may present with polyuria if the obstruction is incomplete.
Prompt relief of obstruction is essential to avoid parenchymal
destruction.
Fluid replacement during a postobstructive diuresis (due to retained
volume and solutes) should be judicious. Overzealous fluid replacement
may lead to replacement of the postobstructive diuresis by a diuresis
secondary to intravenous fluids.
Definition
Obstructive uropathy describes an impediment to urine flow due to
structural or functional change anywhere from the renal pelvis to the tip
of the urethra. This resistance to flow increases pressure proximal to the
point of obstruction. Renal parenchymal damage may or may not be
associated.
Obstructive nephropathy describes any functional or pathologic
changes in the kidney that result from UTO.
232

Classification
Obstructive uropathy is classified based on the duration, level, and
degree of obstruction.26
The duration is characterized as either acute or chronic (hours to weeks
vs. months to years).
Obstruction is considered upper tract if it is located above the
ureterovesical junction and lower tract if located below it.
The degree of obstruction is either complete or partial.
The common causes of obstruction are noted in Tables 12-2, 12-3 and 124.
Epidemiology
UTO accounts for <5% of cases of AKI in the hospitalized patients.
However, in patients presenting to the emergency room with AKI, it can
be seen in ∼20% of the patients.
The condition has a bimodal distribution:
In childhood, obstructive uropathy is primarily due to congenital
abnormalities of the urinary tract.
Incidence rises after age 60 because of the increased presentation of
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer in older men.
Early identification is critical as the extent to which the renal function
recovers with treatment is inversely proportional to the duration and
degree of obstruction. Hydronephrosis is found at postmortem
examination in 2% to 4% of patients.27

233

Etiology
Obstructive uropathy may be the result of anatomic or functional
abnormalities anywhere in the urinary tract. These abnormalities are
either congenital (Table 12-2) or acquired (Tables 12-3 and 12-4). The
etiology varies depending on the age and sex of the patient.
In children, obstruction is due mainly to anatomic abnormalities,
including urethral valves or stricture and stenosis at the ureterovesical or
ureteropelvic junction.
Nephrolithiasis is the most common cause of obstructive uropathy in
young adults.
In females, pregnancy (due to the effects of progesterone and
mechanical pressure by the gravid uterus) and gynecologic tumors
account for most of the cases.
In the older adults, the most common causes are BPH or prostate cancer,
retroperitoneal or pelvic tumors, and stones.

234

Pathophysiology
Obstruction to the urinary flow affects the kidney through a variety of
factors with complex interactions that alter both glomerular
hemodynamics and tubular function.28
The GFR drops after the onset of UTO because of a decrease in net
hydrostatic pressure across the glomerular capillary wall. Initially, this is
235

due to an increase in intratubular pressure, but in the latter stages of
obstruction, it is secondary to a fall in intraglomerular pressure. This
reduction in intraglomerular pressure is a manifestation of decreased
RBF, caused by AII- and thromboxane A2-mediated vasoconstriction.
Obstructive nephropathy is also associated with several abnormalities of
tubular function believed to be caused by increased pressure within the
tubules, leading to altered transport of sodium, water, and several other
ions and solutes.
In long-standing obstruction, the parenchyma atrophies, and fibrosis and
scarring of the tubulointerstitium follow.29

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical manifestations vary with the site, degree, and rapidity of onset
of obstructive uropathy.29,30 The diagnosis should be considered in
patients with any of the following:
Pain:
Kidney and ureteral pain is usually along the T11 to T12 distribution.
Upper ureteral or renal pelvic lesions cause flank pain or tenderness,
whereas lower ureteral obstruction may present with colicky pain
radiating to the ipsilateral testicle or labia.
Severe pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting may result from
acute complete ureteral obstruction (e.g., obstructing ureteral calculus).
In patients with partial or slowly developing obstruction (e.g., pelvic
tumor), pain may be minimal or absent.
Palpable mass:
Hydronephrosis may rarely present as a palpable flank mass,
236

particularly in long-standing cases.
A palpable mass in the suprapubic area may represent a distended
bladder.
Change in voiding pattern and symptoms:
Unilateral obstruction does not cause decreased urine volume unless it
occurs in the only functioning kidney.
Complete obstruction at the level of the bladder or urethra results in
anuria.
Partial or intermittent obstruction can result in polyuria or polyuria
alternating with oligoanuria. Difficulty in voiding or abnormalities in
the urine stream may be present.
Urinary urgency and frequency, as well as dysuria, may be seen in
infection, complicating obstruction.
Unexplained renal failure:
Obstruction should be considered in all patients with renal failure
without a history of kidney disease and relatively benign urinary
sediment.
Obstructive uropathy by itself can lead to renal failure due to pressure
atrophy, intrarenal reflux, and ischemia, or it can be superimposed on
another renal parenchymal disease and accelerate the rate of its
progression.
Other complications:
Recurrent urinary tract infections without any explanation (and
failure of adequate antibiotics to clear them) should always raise the
suspicion of stasis and obstruction.
Hypertension may be seen with both unilateral and bilateral
obstruction of any duration. Unilateral obstruction causes elevated renin
237

levels with activation of the RAAS axis, leading to hypertension. In cases
of bilateral obstruction, hypertension is due to increased extracellular
fluid volume secondary to impaired sodium excretion.
Nephrolithiasis, in addition to being a cause, can be a result of UTO.
Chronic obstruction promotes infection. Infection with urease-producing
organisms leads to increased urine pH, precipitating struvite stone
formation. Infection in this setting is extremely difficult to eradicate
unless the stone is removed.
Hyperkalemic hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may sometimes
complicate partial obstruction. In this “pseudohypoaldosterone” state,
tubules damaged by obstruction cannot respond fully to aldosterone,
leading to difficulty in excreting potassium and hydrogen ions. Any
elderly, nondiabetic patient who has a chemical picture suggestive of
hyperkalemic hyperchloremic acidosis should be carefully evaluated for
obstruction.
Impaired concentrating ability of the kidney (nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus) caused by renal tubular defects results in polyuria and
polydipsia. Elderly patients with impaired thirst mechanisms may present
with dehydration and hypernatremia.
Polycythemia has been associated with hydronephrosis and is likely
related to increased production of erythropoietin by the obstructed
kidney.
History
Obstructive (hesitancy, weak stream, intermittency) and irritative
(frequency, nocturia, urgency) symptoms are important to obtain, given
that prostatic disease is the most common cause of lower tract
obstruction. Hematuria may also relate to many other potential
pathologic conditions causing UTO.
Pain in the flank or suprapubic region, with specific radiation patterns, is
suggestive.

238

A history of urinary tract infections, stones, diabetes, or neurologic
disease that could make bladder evacuation difficult is also important to
determine.
Recent surgery or history of tumors or radiation to the pelvis may
provide clues to the etiology.
Medication history must be carefully explored to assess functional causes
of obstruction, such as anticholinergic medications.
Physical Examination
A complete physical exam should be performed to help determine the
volume status of the patient.
Special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that the abdomen and
flanks are carefully examined for the presence of any palpable masses. A
distended bladder may be felt in the suprapubic region. Costovertebral
tenderness should be elicited.
A digital rectal examination should be performed. Females should receive
a pelvic examination.
Diagnostic Testing
Urinalysis, serum chemistries, and blood cell counts should be obtained.
Imaging studies and diagnostic procedures are done depending on
symptoms and suspected level of obstruction.
Laboratories
Urinalysis is expected to be bland in uncomplicated UTO.
Clues to underlying etiologies may be provided by abnormalities in the
urine.
Hematuria may suggest the presence of stones, infection, or tumor.
Crystals on urine microscopy may be seen with metabolic abnormalities,
239

leading to production of stones. Thus, the type of crystal seen provides
information on not only the presence of a stone but possibly also the type
of stone causing obstruction.
Serum chemistries may detect renal insufficiency, suggesting that
obstruction may be bilateral and severe or complete. Other metabolic
abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia and acidosis, may be present.
Imaging
Plain radiography can provide a gross estimate of kidney size. It may
reveal renal pelvic, ureteral, or bladder calculi, the majority (90%) of
which are radiopaque. However, ultrasonography (US) provides better
information and is readily available; hence, plain films are rarely
obtained if one suspects AKI from urinary obstruction.
US is the initial imaging test of choice in most patients. It is readily
available, noninvasive, inexpensive, and avoids contrast exposure. US
can determine renal size and may reveal dilation of the collecting system
(hydronephrosis), which is suggestive of postrenal AKI. Figure 12-2 shows
an US image of obstruction with preserved renal cortex.
It is important to review the ultrasound with the radiologist, especially
with regard to the extent of the damage to the renal cortex. If the renal
cortex is extremely thinned out, then chances are that the obstruction was
long standing and relieving it will not improve renal function.

240

FIGURE 12-2. Ultrasound image of the kidney demonstrating the
dilated calyces (arrowheads) with preserved renal cortex (between
arrows). (Courtesy of William D. Middleton, MD, Washington
University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.)
False-positive results can be seen in cases of extrarenal pelvis, congenital
megacalyces, renal cysts, calcyceal diverticula, and diuresis. A dilated
collecting system without obstruction can be seen in cases of ileal
conduits, vesicoureteral reflux, primary megaureter, and acute
pyelonephritis.
Absence of hydronephrosis (and false-negative results) can occur with
severe dehydration, early or mild obstruction, staghorn calculi, or if
retroperitoneal fibrosis or tumor encases the collecting system,
preventing dilation of the ureter.
If obstruction is strongly suspected as the cause of AKI and ultrasound is
inconclusive, the physician must strongly consider seeking a urology
consultation for cystoscopy.
Computed tomography (CT) has become a very useful tool to assess
UTO. It may be performed rapidly and does not require the use of
intravenous contrast. The ability to evaluate the cause of obstruction
affords CT an invaluable advantage. Unenhanced helical CT is the
modality of choice and is particularly accurate for obstruction due to
ureteral calculi.
Magnetic resonance imaging can be used, but it is not superior in
accuracy to US or CT. In addition, it is time-consuming and expensive.
Intravenous urography can be useful to define anatomy and to identify
the level of obstructive uropathy. However, it is rarely used, given the
potential for exacerbation of renal failure with intravenous contrast.
Antegrade or retrograde pyelography is preferred to studies that
require intravenous administration of contrast agents in patients with
renal insufficiency. Antegrade pyelography entails percutaneous
placement of a catheter into the renal pelvis, whereas retrograde studies
241

are done through a cystosope. These procedures help to delineate the
obstruction further.
Radionuclide scans can detect obstruction without use of contrast
agents but require some renal function. Performed by injection of
radionuclide tracer, images are then obtained with a gamma-scintillation
camera and reveal delayed excretion of the tracer. Sensitivity of the test
is enhanced when used in conjunction with diuresis renography.
Administration of a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide) causes a rapid
washout of the tracer in cases of functional obstruction, but cannot do so
if there is mechanical obstruction to urine flow. This can help to
differentiate between intrinsic renal injury versus obstruction.
Voiding cystourethrography is helpful for bladder neck and urethral
obstructions, as well as vesicoureteral reflux.

TREATMENT
Therapy is aimed at achieving three main goals31:
Elimination of any life-threatening complication of obstruction.
This involves rapid restoration of intravascular volume, treatment of
severe metabolic complications (e.g., hyperkalemia, acidosis), and
initiation of aggressive management of infection.
Preservation of renal function. If the problem is bilateral obstruction,
immediate steps to relieve the obstruction are mandated. The longer the
obstruction, the higher the risk for irreversible renal parenchymal
damage. The location of the obstruction dictates the procedure of choice.
Lower obstructive uropathy may require a catheter or more proximal
drainage. If a transurethral catheter cannot be placed, a urology
consultation may be needed to place a suprapubic catheter.
For an upper tract obstruction, the placement of percutaneous
nephrostomy tubes or ureteral catheters or stents should be requested,
and performed immediately by interventional radiology or urology.

242

Determination of the cause of obstruction and definitive treatment.
Definitive diagnosis and therapy can be planned and pursued once the
patient has been stabilized and the urinary system decompressed.

COMPLICATIONS
Postobstructive Diuresis
Polyuria, associated with substantial losses of water and solutes, is
commonly seen after relief of severe, bilateral obstruction.
The factors causing this phenomenon are osmotic diuresis caused by
retained urea and other osmoles, volume overload, tubular concentration
defects, and accumulation of natriuretic factors (e.g., atrial natriuretic
peptide).
Osmotic diuresis and volume overload are predominant early and cease
with excretion of the excess solute and water. However, tubular
insensitivity to ADH at times may persist longer.
Volume depletion will develop once the obstruction is relieved if urine
losses are not replaced.
As the diuresis can be substantial, volume status, urine output, and
chemistry values in blood and urine need to be closely monitored to
gauge fluid and electrolyte support (e.g., hypotonic vs. isotonic fluids,
requirement for potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus).
It is reasonable to start with 0.45% saline and replace approximately
two-thirds of the urine losses. If signs of hypo- or hypervolemia develop,
the replacement rate can be adjusted accordingly. The replacement fluid
rate can be gradually decreased over the course of the next few days.
Hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia are frequently
seen during postobstructive diuresis.
Fluid replacement during postobstructive diuresis should be performed
cautiously. Overzealous fluid replacement will lead to persistent high
243

urine flow rates despite the resolution of the osmotic diuresis.

PROGNOSIS
Recovery of renal function clearly correlates with the degree and
duration of obstruction.
Recovery from complete obstruction can be seen within 1 week if no
irreversible renal injury has occurred, but may take up to 12 weeks to
achieve a new lower baseline if some damage has occurred.
Recovery from partial obstruction will typically be seen within 7 to 10
days.
Correction of the obstruction may not be necessary in UNILATERAL
obstruction, if the patient is largely asymptomatic, the plasma creatinine
concentration is normal, and there is little or no parenchymal atrophy on
US.
In a prospective study in patients with unilateral obstructive uropathy
with a normal-functioning contralateral kidney, the preoperative
renographic clearance and perfusion of the corresponding kidney were
the only predictors of recoverability of unilateral renal obstruction.
Kidneys with a renographic GFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m2 were irreversibly
damaged. Improvement or stabilization of function was expected after
relief of obstruction of kidneys with a renographic GFR ≥10
mL/min/1.73 m2.32

Intrinsic Causes of Acute Kidney
Injury
Judy L. Jang
Once hemodynamic and postrenal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI)
have been excluded, acute renal dysfunction that is intrinsic to the
kidneys must be considered.
In the approach to intrinsic AKI, it is helpful to group the etiologies by
the site of initial nephron pathology: the supplying microvasculature, the
glomerulus, the tubule, or the interstitium (Table 13-1). Although
significant clinical overlap exists, a few readily attainable clinical
findings might suggest the category to which a particular case of intrinsic
AKI belongs:
Microvascular: new or accelerating hypertension with evidence of
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
Glomerular: new or accelerating hypertension and volume overload,
heavy proteinuria, and/or significant hematuria, especially if red blood
cell casts are present.
Tubular: urinary sediment containing characteristic tubular cell casts or
crystals.
Interstitial: the presence of pyuria or white blood cell casts.
This chapter will focus on the causes of intrinsic AKI that involve the
nonglomerular segments of the nephron. Glomerular causes of renal
insufficiency found in Table 13-1 are discussed elsewhere.

MICROVASCULAR AKI
248

Atheroembolic renal disease, malignant hypertension, and scleroderma
renal crisis may manifest as an acute decline in renal function due to
injury to the small arteries and arterioles supplying the glomeruli as the
primary pathologic event.
In antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS),
thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), preeclampsia, and HELLP
(hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome, the
initial site of injury may be the supplying microvasculature and/or the
glomerular capillaries themselves as a result of generalized endothelial
dysfunction.
Special emphasis is given to atheroembolic renal disease because of its
increased incidence compared with others in this category. Malignant
hypertension, HUS, TTP, preeclampsia, and HELLP are discussed in detail
elsewhere in this manual and will only be briefly mentioned in this
chapter.

ATHEROEMBOLIC RENAL DISEASE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Atheroembolic renal disease refers to AKI that arises from the occlusion
249

of the renal microvasculature from inflammation caused by deposition of
lipid debris.
Classification
Three patterns of disease evolution may be apparent in atheroembolic
renal disease:
Acute (35% of cases): An abrupt deterioration in renal function occurs 3
to 7 days after the inciting event, usually with multisystem organ
involvement from a massive embolic shower.
Subacute (56% of cases): Repeated smaller embolic showers or
progressive obliterative arteritis in previously involved vessels leads to
a stepwise deterioration in renal function, with stabilization by 3 to 8
weeks. This is the most common pattern of the disease.
Chronic (9% of cases): Renal insufficiency is slowly progressive and is
hard to distinguish from worsening hypertensive nephrosclerosis or
ischemic renovascular disease.1
Epidemiology
Atheroembolic renal disease is most commonly a disease of the elderly
white male.
The mean age of presentation is 66 to 70 years and men are affected four
times as commonly as women, paralleling the prevalence bias of
atherosclerotic vascular disease.2,3
The incidence of clinically significant renal atheroemboli is not well
defined. It occurs much more commonly with aortography and aortic
surgeries.4
Pathophysiology
Setting the stage for the occurrence of atheroembolic renal disease is the
presence of aortic atherosclerosis upstream of the kidneys.
250

Although spontaneous atheroemboli may occur, more often there is an
inciting event leading to plaque destabilization and distal showering of
lipid.
In the majority of provoked cases, plaque destabilization occurs from
vascular wall trauma during either vascular surgeries or percutaneous
endovascular procedures.
It has also been suggested that anticoagulation and thrombolytic
administration may be causative.2,3 However, despite widespread use of
anticoagulants and thrombolytic agents, the incidence of renal
atheroemboli in the absence of preceding vascular procedures is low.
The lipid lodges in the small arterioles and incites thrombus
formation, causing distal ischemia and infarction. Within days there may
be recanalization of the thrombus and restoration of blood flow, but an
inflammatory foreign body arteritis then ensues, leading to progressive
fibrosis and eventual obliteration of the vessel lumen. Continued nephron
ischemia thus occurs.5
Prevention
Preventive measures include secondary prevention of atherosclerotic
risk factors.
The possibility of using a brachial or axillary approach for endovascular
procedures needs to be considered, as most atherosclerotic plaques are in
the abdominal aorta.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The main manifestations of atheroembolic disease are listed in Table 132.
Patients usually have multiple cardiac disease risk factors, a history of
cerebrovascular accidents, or an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
251

The typical patient is noted to have blue or dark red discoloration of
the toes associated with increasing creatinine several days after a
vascular procedure. Lipid embolism can occur from 3 days to 3 months
after the inciting event.
The skin is the most commonly affected organ, but the reliance on
characteristic skin findings (e.g., livedo reticularis, cyanotic changes) for
diagnosis may contribute to the underrepresentation of this disease
among dark-skinned races.
Other organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract and central
nervous system may be simultaneously involved.1
The multisystem disease involvement, together with the variable
occurrence of eosinophilia and depressed complement levels, may
mimic a vasculitis.6
Renal histology reveals empty clefts in arcuate and interlobular arteries
from the dissolution of lipid from these sites by the fixation process.
Early lesions display an inflammatory arteritis composed of eosinophils,
neutrophils, and macrophages, which is later replaced by a giant cell
foreign body reaction with proliferation and fibrosis of the vascular
intima. Acutely, the tubules may show signs of acute tubular necrosis
(ATN).
Late in evolution, patchy glomerular sclerosis and tubular atrophy may
be visualized in areas supplied by affected vessels. Similar arteriolar
inflammation or fibrosis can be found in other tissues, especially the
muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and skin.5,6
Biopsy of skin lesions may have an especially high diagnostic yield.

252

TREATMENT
As no means of reversing the tissue injury exists, therapy consists of
aggressive supportive care addressing the most common mechanisms of
death in the acute multivisceral forms of the disease.
These include ongoing cardiac ischemia, decompensated heart failure,
stroke, and malnutrition in the setting of gastrointestinal ischemia.
With multivisceral involvement, further anticoagulation or
intravascular manipulations should be strictly avoided, perhaps
even in the setting of recurrent cardiac ischemia.
Particular attention should be given to the management of
hypertension (preferably with use of renin–angiotensin blockade) and
volume overload.
If renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required, hemodialysis should
be performed without anticoagulation. If this is not possible, peritoneal
dialysis can be employed.
253

Nutritional support should be aggressive, even administered
parenterally if needed, in those with significant gut ischemia.
In addition to these basic management principles, various other
strategies have been pursued.
Corticosteroids have not been proven to affect renal outcome.
Association data suggest a benefit from statin use, perhaps through
atherosclerotic plaque stabilization and reductions in inflammation.3,5

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Patients with renal atheroemboli have poor overall prognosis.
Progression to dialysis dependence occurs in approximately one-third of
the patients who survive the initial insult, though a mild improvement in
glomerular filtration rate can occur.
In a large study of 354 patients, atheroembolic renal disease resulted in
end-stage renal disease and death in 33% and 28% of patients,
respectively, after an average follow-up of 2 years.2

Other Microvascular Causes of Intrinsic AKI
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Scleroderma renal crisis refers to a clinical entity of acute and
progressive renal dysfunction with worsening hypertension occurring in
scleroderma patients. An incompletely understood endothelial cell
dysfunction with vascular hyperresponsiveness underlies its pathogenesis,
as in the other tissues that scleroderma affects.
In APS, antibodies with specificity for anionic phospholipids or the
plasma proteins that bind to them induce activation of platelets and
endothelial cells, leading to a procoagulant state. If thrombosis occurs
primarily in the microvasculature, this can result in an acute or chronic
thrombotic microangiopathy in multiple organs, including the kidney.
254

Macroscopic thrombosis may involve the renal arteries in APS and may
mimic the microvascular forms of the disease with acute renal failure and
accelerating hypertension.7
Catastrophic APS is said to be present if an additional procoagulant
stimulus (e.g., infection, surgery, or withdrawal of anticoagulation)
initiates fulminant, predominantly microvascular thrombosis that
clinically involves at least three different organ systems in a span of <1
week.
HUS and TTP are syndromes of systemic thrombotic microangiopathy
and prominent consumptive thrombocytopenia.
In HUS, drugs, infections, or toxins initiate endothelial and neutrophil
activation or a deficiency in complement regulatory molecules leads to
microvascular thrombosis.
TTP appears to result from the accumulation of large von Willebrand
multimers from reduced ADAMTS13 protease activity. The large
multimers then initiate platelet aggregation and activation in the small
vessels.
Preeclampsia is a syndrome of new or worsening hypertension with
proteinuria, occurring in the late stages of pregnancy. Endothelial
dysfunction seems to occur from an imbalance of placenta-derived
angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors.
HELLP is a more severe variant of preeclampsia in which
microangiopathic anemia is more prominent and there is also evidence of
liver dysfunction.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Some of the clinical features that distinguish the diseases in this category
of intrinsic AKI are discussed in Table 13-3.

255

The vasculopathy in these disorders leads to glomerular ischemia, which
prompts a vicious cycle of high renin- and angiotensin-induced
vasoconstriction, rises in blood pressure, and further glomerular ischemia.
This is most apparent in scleroderma renal crisis, in which there is fairly
prompt reversal of the disease with the initiation of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibition.11

256

The appearance of accelerating hypertension and worsening renal
function is common to all of the diseases in this category of AKI
secondary to the shared pathophysiologic mechanism of ischemia, leading
to increased renin production.
Marked hypertension may lead to signs of decompensated heart failure
or angina.
Headaches, altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits
can be evident from hypertensive encephalopathy or cerebral
microvascular occlusions.
Retinal hemorrhages, exudates, or papilledema may be observed on
fundoscopic exam.
Laboratory data may reveal findings consistent with a
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytosis, elevated lactate
dehydrogenase, and reduced haptoglobin).
On urinalysis, hematuria, granular casts, and worsening proteinuria may
be present in varying degrees.
Renal histology findings are remarkably similar amongst the diseases in
this category, except that malignant hypertension and scleroderma renal
crisis may involve the preglomerular vessels more prominently.
Early on, fibrinoid necrosis with a paucity of inflammatory infiltrate is
seen in the small arteries and arterioles. Thrombi may be visualized in
glomerular capillary loops. Glomerular endotheliosis, or swelling of
endothelial cells with subendothelial deposition of hyaline material, may
be seen in any of these diseases, but is more prominent in preeclampsia.
Later, the intima displays myxoid thickening and finally undergoes
fibrous proliferation, resulting in the typical concentric onion skin
lesions that may obliterate the lumen of smaller vessels. There is
secondary ischemic sclerosis and dropout of supplied glomeruli and
tubules.

257

TREATMENT
Basic principles of management are presented in Table 13-3.

TUBULAR AKI
The causes of intrinsic AKI in which the primary site of injury is the renal
tubule include ATN, the crystalline nephropathies, and myeloma cast
nephropathy (see Table 13-1).
Though not helpful for diagnosing cast nephropathy, clues to the
presence of the remaining causes of AKI in this category may be obtained
from analysis of the urine sediment: muddy brown casts may be
visualized in ATN and characteristic crystals might be seen in the
crystalline nephropathies. ATN will not be discussed any further here as it
is presented elsewhere in this manual.

CRYSTALLINE NEPHROPATHIES
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
The crystalline nephropathies describe the AKI that results from the
intratubular precipitation of various compounds.
The most common cause of crystalline nephropathy is tumor lysis
syndrome (TLS), which includes the entities acute uric acid nephropathy
and acute phosphate nephropathy.
Less commonly, crystalline nephropathy may result from the
precipitation of calcium oxalate, acyclovir, sulfonamide,
methotrexate, indinavir, or triamterene.
There are rare case reports of occurrence of crystalline nephropathy with
the use of ciprofloxacin, foscarnet, and ampicillin, and with plasma cell
dyscrasias.
258

Pathophysiology and Risk Factors
Intratubular crystal formation and deposition is promoted by three
mechanisms: high tubular fluid concentration of a substance, prolonged
intratubular transit time, and decreased solubility.
The first two mechanisms occur in the setting of decreased effective
circulating volume, leading to an increase in proximal tubular fluid
reabsorption. This results in both high concentrations of the offending
compound in the distal tubule and decreased distal flow rates.
Underlying chronic kidney disease is also a major risk factor for the
crystalline nephropathies, because a larger amount of the compound is
excreted per functioning nephron and because drugs are frequently
overdosed in renal insufficiency.
The third mechanism, decreased solubility, is often dependent on the
distal tubular fluid pH.
Compounds with a pKa <7, such as uric acid, calcium oxalate,
sulfonamides, methotrexate, and triamterene, tend to precipitate in acidic
urine, whereas compounds with a pKa >7, such as indinavir and calcium
phosphate, tend to precipitate in alkaline urine.12
Prevention
The mainstay of prevention is avoidance of the two most frequent
predisposing factors: volume depletion and drug overdosing (usually
from failure to adjust the dose for renal impairment).
Establishing a brisk urine output (e.g., ≥100 to 150 mL/h) in high-risk
patients is extremely important.
For substances with pKa <7, urinary alkalinization by administering
intravenous isotonic bicarbonate solutions or oral citrate can be
considered.12 Urine pH should be periodically followed to ensure an
appropriate level of alkalinization. Acetazolamide may be added if a
metabolic alkalosis ensues.
259

Attempting to acidify the urine to increase the solubility of weakly basic
compounds is dangerous and not recommended.
These preventive strategies are based on underlying pathophysiologic
mechanisms and evidence for reductions in crystalline nephropathy
occurrence is lacking, except perhaps in the case of high-dose
methotrexate administration.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical contexts in which the more common crystalline
nephropathies occur are summarized in Table 13-4. The clinical
manifestations of ethylene glycol intoxication are discussed later.
Extensive crystal deposition in any of the forms of crystalline
nephropathy may result in pain from distention of the renal capsule,
which is similar to ureteral colic.
Nephrolithiasis may coexist with intratubular crystal deposition in some
cases (especially with indinavir and sulfonamides).18,19
Hypocalcemia due to the coprecipitation of calcium in acute phosphate
nephropathy and oxalate nephropathy may result in paresthesias,
lethargy, or tetany.
High levels of acyclovir accumulating with the onset of renal failure can
lead to hallucinations, delirium, and myoclonus. Similarly, toxic levels of
methotrexate can also cause neurologic disturbances, as well as nausea,
rash, and mucositis.
Diagnostic Testing
A summary of the laboratory findings characteristic for the more common
etiologies of crystalline nephropathy is found in Table 13-4.
Urine sediment findings will often reveal hematuria, pyuria, and
mild proteinuria. Although the offending substances have unique crystal
260

morphologies on urine microscopy, examining the sediment is not
independently diagnostic.
As the obstructed tubules may not empty urine into the collecting system,
the absence of crystals does not exclude crystalline nephropathy.
The presence of crystals does not prove their pathogenic role, because
calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid crystalluria can be seen
in normal individuals. In addition, patients receiving typical offending
medications can sometimes display crystalluria without AKI.
Renal ultrasound may reveal bilaterally enlarged and echogenic
kidneys and can identify concomitant macroscopic lithiasis.
Renal biopsy is required to make a definitive diagnosis.
Light microscopy reveals crystalline deposits, usually in the distal
tubules, with a surrounding interstitial infiltrate that may contain giant
cells as part of a foreign body reaction. Evidence of ATN can also be
present as many of the inciting agents display direct tubular cell toxicity.
Polarized microscopy may demonstrate birefringence depending on the
offending agent.

TREATMENT
Treatment of established AKI consists of discontinuing the offending
agent and, if nonoliguric and not volume overloaded, applying the same
principles used in prevention: establishing brisk urine flow with
volume expansion and the judicious use of diuretics and, for weak acids,
urinary alkalinization.
Moderate-to-large doses of diuretics may be required to establish
adequate urine flow, and care must be taken with bicarbonate loading to
avoid severe alkalosis.
Additionally, early initiation of RRT can rapidly decrease the
concentration of some inciting agents (e.g., phosphate, oxalate, and
261

acyclovir).

262

Evidence for improved renal outcome with the abovementioned
maneuvers is lacking.
See Table 13-4 for details on specific management strategies for the
various causes of crystalline nephropathy.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The pathogenesis and management of crystalline AKI from TLS and
ethylene glycol intoxication are discussed further below.
Tumor Lysis Syndrome
TLS results from the sudden release of normally intracellular compounds
to the extracellular space from massive tumor cell death.
The main risk factor is the presence of a large tumor burden with a
rapid doubling time and thus exquisite response to cytolytic therapy.
Most cancers associated with TLS are high-grade lymphoproliferative
malignancies, with up to 6% of these patients developing this
263

complication. It has also been reported with several aggressive solid
tumors, including lung and breast carcinoma.
Though the disease usually arises in the setting of traditional potent
chemotherapy directed against nucleic acid processing, it has also been
observed with interferon, endocrine therapies such as corticosteroids or
tamoxifen, and radiation treatment.
Spontaneous TLS can also occur when aggressive cancers rapidly outstrip
their nutrient supply.
The AKI due to TLS has historically been thought of as an acute uric acid
nephropathy.
Purine nucleosides are released by dying cells and are metabolized to
hypoxanthine and xanthine. Xanthine oxidase converts both
intermediates to uric acid. At normal plasma pH, 98% of uric acid exists
as the more-soluble ionized salt, urate. In the normally acidic tubular
fluid, it exists primarily as the less-soluble uric acid and may precipitate
in the kidney.
As hypouricemic therapy is commonly employed for prophylaxis in atrisk patients, acute phosphate nephropathy has become an important
cause of AKI in TLS. Significant amounts of phosphate complexed with
adenosine exist in the intracellular compartment, especially in
metabolically active cancer cells. Once released by cell death, phosphate
precipitates in the renal tubules and other tissues as calcium phosphate.20
High-risk patients for TLS include those with biological evidence of
laboratory TLS (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia,
hyperuricemia), high-grade lymphoproliferative malignancies, large
tumor
burdens, and renal impairment and/or involvement at the time of TLS
diagnosis.21,22
Preventive strategies should be initiated promptly in high- and
intermediate-risk patients, given the potential severity of complications
from TLS.
264

Volume expansion to achieve brisk urine flow and hypouricemic
therapy should be initiated 2 days prior to the start of chemotherapy.
Urine alkalinization is not universally recommended, given the
potential risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in alkaline urine.
Alkalemia can also worsen hypocalcemia by increasing protein binding
of free calcium.
Data from animal studies revealed no reduction in the occurrence of uric
acid nephropathy with urine alkalinization.
Two options for hypouricemic therapy exist: allopurinol and
rasburicase.
Allopurinol (400 to 800 mg total daily dose) competitively inhibits
xanthine oxidase, thus preventing the further production of uric acid. Uric
acid levels decrease over the next 48 hours.
Rasburicase is a recombinant uricase enzyme that converts existing uric
acid to allantoin, which is 5 to 10 times more soluble in urine than uric
acid. After intravenous rasburicase administration (0.05 to 0.20 mg/kg
over 30 minutes), uric acid levels decrease by 86% at 4 hours compared
with a 12% reduction with allopurinol.23
Comparative data between allopurinol and rasburicase regarding
meaningful clinical end points, such as reductions in AKI, dialysis
requirement, or death, do not exist. Therefore, the extremely high cost of
rasburicase deters its use in prevention unless an allopurinol allergy is
present.
Patients with evidence of organ system dysfunction have “clinical TLS”
and require therapeutic rather than preventive interventions.
Similar to preventive methods, maintaining adequate urine flow and
suppressing further rises in the serum concentration of uric acid and
phosphate is essential.
Rasburicase may be used to promptly reduce the uric acid level,
265

eliminating this indication for RRT.
When significant hyperphosphatemia is present, early RRT may still be
required along with non–calcium-based phosphate binders to prevent
further phosphate precipitation and/or hypocalcemia.
Hypocalcemia should not be treated with intravenous calcium without
first lowering the phosphorus, unless the patient is symptomatic or there
are changes in the electrocardiogram.
With intermittent hemodialysis, phosphorus clearance is fairly inefficient
and daily or twice-daily treatments may be needed to achieve negative
phosphorus balance. Continuous RRT may be more effective at reducing
phosphorus levels in this situation.
Most patients with AKI will not require dialysis and will recover to their
previous renal function, though patient and renal prognosis may be
worse with spontaneous TLS.
Ethylene Glycol Intoxication
Ethylene glycol is metabolized by hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase to four
toxic organic compounds: glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid,
and oxalic acid.
Accumulation of the organic anions glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate
leads to a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis.
These compounds, especially glycolic acid, are direct cell toxins and
cause multiorgan dysfunction with heart failure, ATN, and nervous
system depression.
Oxalate precipitates with calcium in several tissues, including the renal
tubules, causing crystalline nephropathy.
The clinical manifestations of ethylene glycol intoxication evolve over
time as the alcohol is metabolized. This time course is prolonged in cases
of ethanol coingestion due to competitive inhibition of alcohol
dehydrogenase.24
266

During the first 30 minutes to 12 hours, ethylene glycol causes
inebriation, with progression to seizures or coma.
At 12 to 36 hours postingestion, peak concentrations of organic acid
intermediates lead to profound acidosis with Kussmaul respirations and
cardiopulmonary failure.
At 24 to 72 hours postingestion, the oxalate end product accumulates in
the tissues, resulting in AKI.
If patients are at high risk, then treatment is initiated to prevent endorgan damage. The criteria for initiation of treatment are: serum
ethylene glycol levels >20 mg/dL; OR a known recent ethylene glycol
ingestion with an osmolal gap >10 mOsm/L; OR strong suspicion of
recent ingestion plus three of the following: pH <7.3, serum bicarbonate
<20 mEq/L, osmolal gap >10 mOsm/L, and/or urinary oxalate crystals.
Management of ethylene glycol intoxication (see Table 13-4) should be
focused on decreasing the concentration of toxic metabolites in high-risk
ingestions. Reductions in the levels of toxic metabolites can be achieved
by:
Limiting further organic acid formation through the use of competitive
alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors such as fomepizole or ethanol.25
Increasing metabolite clearance through early initiation of RRT.
Conversion to less-toxic metabolites by cofactor supplementation.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
In most cases of crystalline nephropathy, the prognosis for full renal
recovery is excellent.
In the drug-related crystalline nephropathies, recovery of renal function
is expected to occur within days to weeks after cessation or even just dose
reduction of the drug.
Phosphate nephropathy due to phosphate-containing laxatives prior to
267

colonoscopy may have a worse prognosis, because the population
affected by this entity is older and has a higher prevalence of underlying
chronic kidney disease.

MYELOMA CAST NEPHROPATHY
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells, most often leading to
overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin, the so-called M-protein.
Myeloma cast nephropathy (myeloma kidney) refers to the intrinsic AKI
that results as the filtered light chain component of the M-protein
(the Bence-Jones protein) exerts toxic and obstructive injury to the
tubules.
Epidemiology
Renal dysfunction is seen in ∼30% of patients with multiple myeloma at
initial diagnosis.26
The likelihood of underlying cast nephropathy is increased in cases of
more profound AKI.
Etiology
Potential etiologies of AKI in patients with myeloma include
hypercalcemia-induced volume depletion, hypotension from infection,
glomerular diseases such as light-chain deposition disease or amyloidosis,
and cast nephropathy.27 AKI can also be associated with bisphosphonate
used in multiple myeloma, especially in a patient with underlying
vitamin D deficiency.
However, in those patients with persistent renal dysfunction, despite
treatment of hypovolemia and infection, cast nephropathy is the most
common cause of AKI.28
268

Pathophysiology
The propensity of a particular myeloma light chain to produce cast
nephropathy depends somewhat on the amount of Bence-Jones
proteinuria and also on its tendency to aggregate together with Tamm–
Horsfall protein.26,29
Proximal tubular injury from additional insults and decreased effective
circulating volume further increase the risk of cast formation, as both
may increase the concentration of light chains in the distal tubule.
Given these mechanisms at play, many cases of myeloma kidney have
an identifiable inciting event:
Volume depletion, perhaps from hypercalcemia-induced diabetes
insipidus.26
Infection resulting in ATN or decreased effective circulating volume.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, through adverse
effects on glomerular filtration.
Iodinated contrast exposure, through its ability to induce afferent
arteriolar vasoconstriction.30

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients with cast nephropathy generally have more advanced myeloma;
hence, other features of the disease are usually present. They may have
complaints of fatigue, bone pain with pathologic fractures, and recurrent
infections.
Anemia is often present. Hypercalcemia from myeloma-induced bone
resorption is common and may lead to polyuria with signs of volume
depletion.30,31 The anion gap may be low from both hypercalcemia and
the presence of circulating cationic paraprotein.
269

Diagnostic Testing
The urine sediment is usually bland, with little or no proteinuria noted
on urine dipstick because this only measures albuminuria.
Urine protein electrophoresis and/or immunofixation will reveal the
presence of a monoclonal light chain in almost all cases.
Serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation will also reveal the
paraprotein, though this is less consistent, especially in cases of lightchain myeloma where the malignant clone produces only light chains
instead of the full immunoglobulin.
The serum free light chain assay is a recently introduced test, with
greater sensitivity for the detection of paraprotein than protein
electrophoresis or immunofixation, and it may further assist in the
diagnosis.
A skeletal survey will usually reveal osteopenia and typical punched-out
lesions in bone.
The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is typically confirmed by bone
marrow biopsy, revealing clonal expansion of plasma cells.
Definitive diagnosis of myeloma kidney requires kidney biopsy,
although kidney-specific therapy may be ineffective.
Renal biopsy may only be necessary when considering plasma exchange
or other diagnoses.
Characteristic eosinophilic casts with a “brittle” or “fractured”
appearance may be visualized in the lumens of distal tubules on light
microscopy. There may be tubular cell toxicity and surrounding
interstitial inflammation, occasionally taking the form of a giant cell
reaction.32 Cast nephropathy can be misinterpreted as interstitial
nephritis; hence, it is vital for the nephrologist to review the histology
with the pathologist, to avoid misdiagnosis.

270

TREATMENT
Treatment of cast nephropathy primarily consists of supportive care and
treatment of the underlying malignancy.
Hypovolemia and hypercalcemia should be corrected, infections should
be treated aggressively, and other nephrotoxic insults should be removed.
There is no evidence that forced diuresis with loop diuretics improves
recovery by washing out obstructing casts. In fact, animal data suggest
that there may even be an increase in the tendency to form casts with
this strategy.33
Treatment of the underlying myeloma should be initiated promptly in
consultation with an oncologist in order to reduce levels of the
paraprotein as rapidly as possible.
High-dose corticosteroids are a part of all the available treatment
regimens and are the primary noninvasive means to rapidly reduce
paraprotein levels.
Allopurinol should be started prior to institution of therapy for myeloma
to reduce the risk of subsequent TLS.
Plasma exchange has been used for acute treatment of cast
nephropathy as a means to more rapidly reduce paraprotein levels. Data
regarding its use come from small, usually retrospective studies with
conflicting results.
The most often quoted study supporting the use of plasma exchange in
myeloma kidney prospectively enrolled 29 patients to either plasma
exchange or hemodialysis as needed, or to daily continuous peritoneal
dialysis only, regardless of need. All patients received concomitant
corticosteroids and cytotoxic therapy. Renal recovery and survival was
better in the hemodialysis and the plasma exchange group.34
A recent retrospective study of 40 patients analyzed the efficacy of
plasma exchange in patients whose serum levels of free light chains were
271

used to guide therapy and in patients with biopsy-proven cast
nephropathy. A total of 14 patients with cast nephropathy had serum
free light chains measured before and after plasma exchange. In seven of
the nine patients whose free light chains were reduced by 50% or more, a
renal response, defined as 50% reduction in serum creatinine and dialysis
interdependence at 180 days, was seen.35
A larger prospective study randomized 97 patients with a clinical
diagnosis of myeloma kidney to either plasma exchange or no adjunctive
pheresis treatment. All patients received similar chemotherapy, and
hemodialysis was provided to patients in both groups when indicated.
There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes between the
two groups.36 Limitations to the study included uncertainty regarding the
diagnosis of cast nephropathy, as few patients had biopsy-proven
disease.
On the basis of this data, plasma exchange is not recommended for
most cases of cast nephropathy, though it may be considered in
those with a rapid decline in renal function, high paraprotein
levels, and less chronicity seen on renal biopsy.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The median survival of patients with multiple myeloma is ∼3 to 4 years.
The occurrence of renal insufficiency shortens the median survival to 1.5
to
2 years.
There is some potential for renal recovery in cast nephropathy with even
severe renal dysfunction, with up to 40% of patients who survive the
short-term period being able to regain dialysis independence.37

INTERSTITIAL AKI
The causes of intrinsic AKI in which the primary site of pathology is the
kidney interstitium include acute interstitial nephritis (AIN),
272

infiltrative malignant processes, and acute pyelonephritis (see Table
13-1).
The presence of pyuria and white blood cell casts on urine sediment
analysis may allow one to tentatively narrow the differential diagnosis to
these interstitial causes of intrinsic renal dysfunction.

Acute Interstitial Nephritis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
AIN is a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by inflammation in the
renal interstitium, sparing the glomeruli.
Epidemiology
AIN is the predominant finding in 10% of biopsies performed in cases of
AKI.38
The incidence seems to be increasing, perhaps as a result of more liberal
prescribing practices and the availability of new medications.
Etiology
The major causes of AIN are drugs (70% of cases), infections (15%),
and systemic diseases (Table 13-5). Among drug-induced AIN,
antibiotics and NSAIDs, including salicylates and COX-2 inhibitors, may
be responsible for 30% and 40% of cases, respectively.
Other less-common etiologies include idiopathic causes (10%),
tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome (5%), and sarcoidosis
(1%).39
Pathophysiology
AKI results from immune-mediated tubular injury. The localization of
273

inflammation to the interstitium may occur through several mechanisms,
including molecular mimicry with tubular epitopes or deposition of
immunogenic portions of the inciting agent at a specific location in the
kidney.
Similar to other hypersensitivity reactions, AIN is not dose dependent,
there is recrudescence in disease activity on reexposure to compounds
with similar biochemical structure, and there is often multiorgan
involvement.40
Both cell-mediated and humoral immunity seem to play a role, though
the former seems play a more significant role in pathogenesis.41

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The presenting features of AIN can be quite variable, due in part to the
multiplicity of agents that can initiate the syndrome. A summary of
clinical and laboratory features associated with some of the more
common causes of AIN is given in Table 13-6.
The combination of AKI, urinary symptoms (e.g., flank pain,
macroscopic hematuria, or oliguria), and symptoms of hypersensitivity
(e.g., rash, fever, or arthralgias) should alert the clinician to the
possibility of AIN.39,48
Signs of hypersensitivity may be absent in up to half of AIN cases,
especially in those attributable to NSAIDs.49
The temporal relationship between the initiation of a new drug and the
development of renal dysfunction may also aid in the diagnosis.
Disease manifestations develop within 3 weeks of initiation of the
inciting drug in ∼80% of patients, with an average latency of onset of
10 days (range 1 day to >1 year).50
The duration of onset may be longer with NSAIDs, with a mean latent
274

period of 2 to 3 months.49
In AIN related to infection or systemic diseases, the clinical features of
the inciting disease often predominate.
Diagnostic Testing
Urinalysis may reveal nonspecific findings such as hematuria and/or
sterile pyuria.
The presence of white blood cell casts is more specific, although they can
also be seen in pyelonephritis and certain proliferative
glomerulonephritides.
Eosinophiluria (urine eosinophils numbering >1% of the urine white
blood cell count) can be seen (usually detected) more reliably with
Hansel stain than with Wright stain. Though the positive predictive
value of this test is low, the test’s performance characteristics might be
improved if other causes of eosinophiluria, such as urinary tract infection
and atheroembolic disease, can be excluded.41,51

275

276

277

Mild proteinuria is common, but sometimes it may be in the nephrotic
range. Heavy proteinuria is classically associated with NSAIDs, occurring
in a third of cases attributable to this drug class and associated with
concomitant minimal-change glomerulopathy. NSAID-induced
membranous nephropathy can also occur.49,52
Signs of multiorgan dysfunction such as elevated transaminases and
hemolysis can occasionally be seen.
Renal imaging may occasionally reveal normal-to-large kidneys with
increased echogenicity.
Renal biopsy is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and reveals an
edematous interstitium infiltrated mostly by T-cells and
macrophages. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and plasma cells can also be
found and occasionally there may be granulomatous inflammation. There
may be tubulitis or frank tubular necrosis in severe AIN. The glomeruli
are usually normal, but electron microscopy may reveal foot process
effacement in NSAID-associated AIN.

TREATMENT
The most important therapeutic maneuver in AIN is prompt removal of
the inciting agent. In those cases associated with infection or other
278

systemic disease, treatment of the underlying cause is necessary.
Though it is tempting to combat the hypersensitivity response with
corticosteroids, the usefulness of this intervention remains uncertain.
Retrospective studies, including a series of 42 cases, suggest no reduction
in the incidence of chronic kidney disease with corticosteroids.38
However, it might be argued that beneficial effects were not seen because
patients with more severe disease were more likely to receive
corticosteroids.
The best data supporting the use of corticosteroids comes from a small
series of 14 patients, all with methicillin-induced AIN. Corticosteroids
were associated with complete renal recovery more often than
withdrawal of methicillin alone, and the treated group recovered more
quickly.53
Positive observational data with corticosteroids in AIN from other
etiologies exist, but are limited to small case series. In many reports, the
most apparent effect of corticosteroids was a more rapid recovery of
renal function.
The literature is sparse regarding the use of other immunosuppressants
and often describes cases associated with unusual etiologies. Successful
treatment has been described using calcineurin inhibitors,
cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil.
A reasonable treatment strategy in light of these data would be to
reserve corticosteroids for patients with idiopathic AIN, systemic
diseases for which corticosteroids have a proven role (e.g., sarcoidosis,
Sjögren, vasculitides), or cases with poor prognostic features.
Predictors of worse prognosis include delayed onset of improvement in
renal function after withdrawal of the inciting agent (>1 week),
prolonged exposure to the offending agent (>2 to 3 weeks), preexisting
chronic kidney disease, and a renal histology characterized by intense
and diffuse interstitial infiltrate, granuloma formation, or significant
fibrosis and tubular atrophy.
279

A frequently used regimen is oral prednisone (1 mg/kg), with the
duration of therapy guided by the improvement in renal function. Most
patients will improve in the first 1 to 2 weeks.
The presence of conditions that can be exacerbated by corticosteroid
therapy (e.g., slow-healing wounds, brittle diabetes, or active infection)
should dissuade the clinician from using this therapy.
Studies have suggested that corticosteroids do not alter the course of
NSAID-induced AIN, though if poor prognostic features are present,
treatment can still be considered.
Other immunosuppressants are occasionally used when corticosteroid
therapy has failed.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
AIN has a variable clinical course and response to treatment.
In the previous prototype for the disease—methicillin-induced AIN—the
prognosis was excellent with complete recovery of renal function noted
in 90% of patients.53
In nonmethicillin drug-induced AIN, chronic kidney disease persists in
35% to 40% of cases.54
The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is even higher with NSAIDinduced AIN, occurring in 55% of cases.
The prognosis for AIN may depend on the promptness of elimination of
the inciting agent.
The etiologies associated with milder symptoms, and therefore delayed
diagnosis (e.g., NSAIDs, chronic infections, or sarcoidosis), have worse
prognosis than those with more acute and dramatic presentations (e.g.,
methicillin, rifampin, or acute bacterial or viral infections).
Interestingly, the peak serum creatinine does not seem to correlate with
280

the long-term renal prognosis.41

INFILTRATIVE MALIGNANCIES
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Infiltration of the kidneys by malignant cells occurs commonly in
lymphoid and myeloid leukemias and lymphomas.
The kidneys are the most common extramedullary organs involved by
leukemic infiltration, with 63% of autopsies from leukemia patients
displaying this finding.55
Renal dysfunction attributable to leukemic infiltration is rare.56

DIAGNOSIS
AKI from leukemic infiltration may be difficult to distinguish from
spontaneous TLS, which occurs much more commonly and in similar
settings.
Hyperuricemia will be evident in both cases, as uric acid production is
increased in leukemia, and renal failure from any cause leads to
decreased uric acid excretion.
Further complicating this distinction is the fact that leukemic infiltration
of the kidneys is a risk factor for TLS.
Examination of the urine sediment is not helpful, as it usually reveals
nonspecific pyuria and/or hematuria.
The phenomenon is clinically silent in most cases, even though
nephromegaly might be evident on imaging.
Definitive diagnosis requires renal biopsy. Histology usually reveals
tremendous numbers of malignant cells invading the interstitium,
resulting in wide separation and distortion of the tubules.

281

TREATMENT
Management involves treatment of the underlying malignancy while
employing preventive strategies for TLS (see above).
Recovery to near-normal renal function is possible, even in cases of
profound renal dysfunction.

ACUTE PYELONEPHRITIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Etiology
AKI in the setting of acute pyelonephritis occurs most commonly from
prerenal physiology, concomitant obstruction, or ATN from hypotension
or nephrotoxic antibiotics.
The edema and suppurative infiltration of the kidney parenchyma may
alone cause AKI in rare cases.
Pathophysiology
The inflammatory reaction may impinge on the vasa recta that tenuously
support the medullary tubules, and frank papillary necrosis may occur
in patients with vasculopathy such as diabetics.
Risk Factors
Populations at risk for this form of AKI include patients with a single
kidney, renal allograft recipients, and malnourished alcoholics.57,58

DIAGNOSIS
Patients may present with fever, flank pain, or pain over the allograft,
though these classic symptoms of pyelonephritis are absent in a
significant proportion of patients.

282

The urinalysis reveals bacteria and pyuria with or without white blood
cell casts.
Imaging studies may reveal increased renal size.
Renal histology reveals edema, intense neutrophilic infiltration of the
interstitium, and tubular lumens with microabscess formation. With
concomitant papillary necrosis, there may be loss of collecting-duct
epithelium.

TREATMENT
Antibiotic therapy results in slow resolution of the renal dysfunction.
Persistent mild-to-moderate impairment in renal function often occurs, as
inflammation is replaced by sclerosis.

Contrast Induced Nephropathy
Ethan Hoerschgen

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute decline in renal function can occur shortly after the administration
of intravascular iodinated contrast.
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is the third leading cause of
hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI).
CIN is usually reversible, and in many cases preventable with
appropriate management prior to exposure.
CIN is associated with increased length of hospital stay, need for
increased medical care, and mortality.1
Definition
The definition of CIN varies amongst studies, with no absolute consensus
reached.
The most frequent definition of CIN used in literature and clinical
practice is an elevation of serum creatinine >0.5 mg/dL above
baseline or increase of serum creatinine >25%, within 48 to 72
hours after administration of contrast media (CM).
Other etiologies of AKI must also be excluded.
Epidemiology
The incidence of CIN varies significantly from study to study due to
differences in definition of CIN, procedure performed, amount and type
of contrast agent used, patient risk factors, and preventative measures
289

used.
The risk for significant CIN is extremely low in patients with normal
renal function.
One study showed that the risk of CIN was 2.5%, 22.4%, and 30.6% in
patients with a serum creatinine of 1.2 to 1.9 mg/dL, 2.0 to 2.9 mg/dL,
and >3.0 mg/dL, respectively.
The need for hemodialysis from CIN is generally <1%, but increases in
high-risk patients.
Etiology
Contrast media:
The osmolality, type, route of administration, and volume of
contrast agent used all can change its nephrotoxic potential.
The risk of CIN increases as volume of CM used increases, especially
>100 mL.
Repeated contrast exposure, especially <72 hours apart, also
increases the risk for CIN. It is preferred to allow 2 weeks between
exposures if possible.
If there is a rise in serum creatinine after initial exposure to CM, it is
preferable to allow the levels to return to baseline before repeat
exposure.
Intraarterial CM administration has a higher risk for developing CIN
than intravenous (IV) CM administration.
The use of low-osmolar contrast agents (osmolarity ranging from 570
to 900) have shown to be superior to high-osmolar agents (osmolarity
>2000) in preventing CIN.
The use of isoosmolar CM (osmolarity of ∼290) has been shown to be
superior to low-osmolar CM in the prevention of CIN in the past in
290

certain patient populations.2
However, recent studies, including Prospective Evaluation of Diabetic
Ischemic heart disease by Computerized Tomography (PREDICT) and
Cardiac Angiography in REnally impaired patients (CARE), have
demonstrated no significant differences in the rate in CIN between
nonionic low-osmolar and nonionic isoosmolar CM in higher-risk
patients.3,4
Pathophysiology
There are likely several mechanisms that lead to AKI from iodinated
contrast exposure.
Studies have consistently shown that administration of intravascular
contrast leads to reduced renal perfusion due to vasoconstriction.5
Vasoconstriction is most pronounced at the outer medulla, an area highly
susceptible to hypoxia and ischemia.
The likely mechanisms of vasoconstriction are increases in
vasoconstrictors such as endothelin and adenosine. There is also a
decreased production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator.
Research has also demonstrated direct tubular toxic effects from exposure
to CM.
Iodinated contrast may also induce renal cellular injury through oxygenfree radicals and decreased antioxidant activity.
Risk Factors
It is important to identify those patients at increased risk for CIN prior to
exposing them to the potential harm of CM. Risk factors for developing
CIN can be divided into those factors that are modifiable and those that
are fixed risk markers (Table 14-1).
Preexisting renal insufficiency is the most important risk factor for
the development of CIN.
291

A risk stratification score might be useful to identify the high-risk patients
(Table 14-2).6,7
Concomitant medications:
Inhibitors of prostaglandins, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs or cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, should be avoided at least 24 to 48
hours prior to procedure, even though there are no randomized controlled
trials to support this recommendation.
The use of IV diuretics has been shown to be deleterious if given
prior to the procedure. There are no recommendations regarding oral
diuretics, but they should be stopped if the patient appears to have a
decreased effective circulatory volume or hypotension.

Stable doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers may be continued, as long as the patient
is euvolemic and normotensive, as there is no data to support
discontinuation of these medications. Initiation or titration of the
292

medications probably should be avoided in the pericontrast period.

The calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have
vasoconstrictive properties. However, they should not be stopped in the
pericontrast period because of increased risk of rejection in transplanted
organs. Drug levels should be monitored and adjusted to appropriate
levels in the pericontrast period.
Exposure to CM should be avoided when possible while the patients are
on other nephrotoxic medications such as amphotericin B and
aminoglycosides.
Metformin may increase risk of lactic acidosis in setting of renal
insufficiency. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommend that
metformin should be held for 2 to 3 days after CM exposure, to assure
that the patient has not developed AKI.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may have a beneficial
effect and should be continued if possible in the pericontrast period.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
AKI from CM is characterized by a rise in serum creatinine, usually
293

within the first 24 to 48 hours after administration of the agent.
If serum creatinine elevation starts >72 hours after contrast exposure,
then another etiology must be sought.
The AKI is usually nonoliguric and patients are usually asymptomatic.
The elevation in serum creatinine usually peaks ∼3 to 5 days after
exposure.
Some patients may develop oliguric AKI, and these patients usually have
underlying renal insufficiency or conditions that predispose them to other
forms of renal injury.
Approximately 1% of patients will require renal replacement therapy
because of CIN. These patients usually have a longer recovery period.
In general CIN is reversible, but persistent renal injury may occur in
patients with significant renal insufficiency.
Renal athroemboli that occur at the time of the procedure can also cause
renal injury. Onset of renal failure may not occur for days to weeks, and
usually has a prolonged course with less chance for renal recovery.8
History
The likelihood that the etiology of AKI is caused by CIN is strongest if the
individual has had an exposure to CM in the previous 24 to 72 hours.
One should closely search for other etiologies of AKI such as hypotensive
events or the presence of nephrotoxic medications.
Physical Examination
The physical exam is mostly important in helping to differentiate other
causes of AKI from CIN. Evidence of hypovolemia may support the
diagnosis of CIN.
Physical exam may help to diagnose atheroemboli, if there is evidence of
294

livedo reticularis in the lower extremities, “blue toes”, or Hollenhorst
plaques in the retina.
Differential Diagnosis
Other possibilities for AKI must be explored even with a high likelihood
of CIN.
Other etiologies include, but not limited to, renal athroembolic disease,
prerenal disease, interstitial nephritis, and other causes of tubular
necrosis.
Diagnostic Testing
Fractional excretion of sodium is usually <1%, due to the profound
vasoconstriction that happens early in the disease process. However, this
is not diagnostic.
Urine sediment is usually bland and not conclusive, but essential to
evaluate other causes of AKI. Rarely, granular casts are noted.
CM may cause significantly elevated urine specific gravity.
Eosinophilia or low complement levels may suggest renal
athroembolic disease.
Persistent contrast within the kidney on imaging, 24 hours after exposure
to CM, may suggest CIN.
A kidney biopsy is not recommended to evaluate for CIN, unless
further evaluation for other etiologies is needed.

PREVENTION
Avoidance of Contrast
The only way to completely prevent CIN is to avoid the contrast
procedure if at all possible.9
295

The use of noniodinated contrast agents such as gadolinium and carbon
dioxide can be considered in some patients in order to prevent CIN.
Carbon dioxide can give satisfactory imaging with digital extraction, but
has a risk of neurotoxicity and is usually limited to imaging below the
diaphragm.
Gadolinium is associated with pseudocalcemia due to interference with
the calcium assay; calcium replacement should not be routinely
administered without checking an ionized calcium level.
Gadolinium is also associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and
extreme caution should be used before giving gadolinium to patients with
renal insufficiency.
Volume Expansion
IV volume expansion around the time of contrast exposure is believed to
alleviate renal vasoconstriction and improve medullary blood flow.
IV half-normal saline is shown to be superior to half-normal saline plus
diuretics (i.e., furosemide and mannitol) in preventing CIN.
Administration of normal saline has been shown to be superior to halfnormal saline.
IV isotonic sodium bicarbonate has been shown to be superior to isotonic
saline in prevention of CIN after coronary interventions (1.7% in the
sodium bicarbonate group, compared to 13.6% in the normal saline
group).10 Several studies have demonstrated that sodium bicarbonate is
superior or equally effective as normal saline in preventing CIN in
patients at higher risk.
IV normal saline is typically administered at 75 mL/h for 10 hours prior
to the procedure and after the procedure. Patients should be carefully
monitored for signs of volume overload and appropriate urine output.
Typical administration of isotonic sodium bicarbonate (150 mEq/L) is
at a rate of 3 mL/kg for 1 hour prior to the procedure and at a rate of 1
296

mL/kg for
6 hours after the procedure.
Oral hydration, when compared to IV solutions, was not effective in
preventing CIN.
N-acetylcysteine
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is thought to prevent CIN by acting as a
scavenger of oxygen free radicals. The side effect profile of NAC is also
very favorable, which makes it an attractive prevention strategy.
The ability of NAC to prevent CIN is controversial, but several
randomized control trials have demonstrated NAC to be an effective
therapy in preventing CIN when used with IV hydration in high-risk
patients.
The standard dose of NAC was 600 mg PO bid the day before procedure
and the day of procedure.11
Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) had
significant reduction in CIN, with 1200 mg IV bolus of NAC plus 1200 mg
PO bid for 48 hours, compared to 600 mg IV and PO dosing. This suggests
a possible dose-dependent benefit with NAC.12
Given conflicting studies regarding NAC, we cannot recommend the
routine use of NAC. In high-risk patients, high-dose IV NAC can be
considered.
Other Therapies
Ascorbic acid:
Ascorbic acid may prevent CIN through its antioxidant properties, and it
has a strong safety profile. Doses of 3 g prior to cardiac angiography,
followed by 2 g twice after, showed a significant decrease in CIN.
In the renal insufficiency following contrast media administration
(REMEDIAL) trial, treatment with normal saline plus ascorbic acid
297

showed similar rates of CIN in high-risk patients when compared to
normal saline plus NAC.13
Iloprost:
Iloprost is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin PGI2. Iloprost dilates

systemic and pulmonary arterial vascular beds.

A recent study found that prophylactic periprocedural IV administration
of the prostacyclin analog iloprost in patients with renal dysfunction
undergoing a coronary procedure reduced the incidence of CIN by 70%.14
Iloprost may be limited by its blood-pressure-lowering effects.
The use of Iloprost for prevention of CIN is not recommended until
further confirmation of effectiveness and safety.
Fenoldopam:
Fenoldapam is a dopamine-1 receptor agonist, which promotes renal and
systemic vasodilatation.
The CONTRAST trial found no significant reduction in CIN with the
use of fenoldopam when compared to placebo.15
Fenoldopam is not recommended for routine use to prevent CIN.
Theophylline and aminophylline:
Theophylline and aminophylline block adenosine’s vasoconstrictive
effects.
Both agents have a narrow therapeutic window and dangerous side
effects.
The studies looking at both agents for the prevention of CIN have
yielded conflicting results.
The use of these agents is not recommended for the prevention of
298

CIN.
Hemofiltration:
The role of hemofiltration has been investigated in few studies.
One group demonstrated that CIN occurred less in high-risk patients
receiving hemofiltration when compared to IV volume expansion alone.
In this study, CIN was defined by a rise in serum creatinine, and
hemofiltration alone can alter serum creatinine levels. The hospital and
1-year mortality rates were significantly lower in the hemofiltration
group.16
Hemofiltration is limited by its invasiveness, need for intensive care,
and cost.
Hemodialysis has shown no benefit in preventing CIN.
The use of hemofiltration and hemodialysis is not recommended.
However, planning for renal replacement therapy and counseling of
patients regarding potential need for post procedure dialysis should be
included for those patients at extremely high risk for developing CIN.

TREATMENT
There are currently no pharmacologic treatments for CIN.
Treatment consists of supportive care, with focus on avoiding any
further nephrotoxic insults.
Close attention should be given to patient’s volume status, urine output,
and laboratory test results to evaluate for complication of AKI.
Renal replacement therapy may be needed if patient has persistent
complications from AKI, especially volume overload, hyperkalemia, and
metabolic acidosis.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
299

CIN is usually reversible, but has both immediate and sustained effects.
Patients who developed CIN had a higher rate of in-hospital and
postdischarge mortality.
Those patients who develop CIN are also susceptible to other in-hospital
events, including myocardial infarction after PCI, bleeding, shock, and
respiratory failure, and a significant increase in length of hospital stay.17
CIN is potentially a preventable disease. Recognizing high-risk patients
and providing adequate IV hydration and avoiding nephrotoxic agents
prior to the procedure is essential in preventing AKI.

Renal Replacement Therapy in
Acute Kidney Injury
Anitha Vijayan

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is required in patients with acute
kidney injury (AKI) when the residual native function is insufficient to
maintain volume, electrolyte, and acid–base balance, or uremic factors
trigger systemic complications such as mental status changes, bleeding
diathesis, pericarditis, and so forth.
The timing of initiation of RRT in AKI remains controversial.
RRT should be dosed appropriately based on evidence-based data.
There are different modalities available to patients.
RRT should be carefully supervised by the treating nephrologist, and
every attempt should be done to minimize complications and adverse
events. Patients should be carefully monitored for signs of renal recovery
such as increasing urine output and downtrending of serum creatinine.
Indications
The conventional factors that trigger RRT include:
metabolic acidosis
hyperkalemia
volume overload
302

uremia
The exact definition of “uremia” is vague. Therefore, there is extensive
variability in the timing of initiation from institution to institution and
even among individual nephrologists at the same institution.1,2
The important indications for initiation of hemodialysis in AKI are
provided in Table 15-1.
Modalities of RRT
The available modalities are:
intermittent hemodialysis (IHD)
continuous RRT (CRRT)
sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) or extended dialysis (ED)
peritoneal dialysis (PD)
The choice depends on the availability of therapies at the institution,
physician preference, the patient’s hemodynamic status, and the presence
of comorbid conditions.3
Patients with sepsis or hepatic failure may have potential benefits with
continuous therapies.

303

Small studies have shown that intracranial pressure is more stable with
CRRT than with IHD in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.4
High-flow CRRT has been shown to remove inflammatory cytokines in
sepsis, but hard end points such as mortality, hospital length of stay, and
renal recovery are yet to be studied.
Intermittent modalities are generally accepted to cause greater
fluctuations in blood pressure and produce greater fluid shifts in a short
amount of time.
Continuous modalities allow for the same solute clearance and fluid
removal, but spread out over a 24-hour period, and thus are favored in
hemodynamically unstable patients.
In the United States, CRRT is performed in ∼30% of patients with AKI
and has almost completely replaced PD in the treatment of AKI.5
CRRT has not shown improved survival over IHD in critically ill
patients.6,7
Likewise, randomized trials have not shown a difference in time to renal
recovery or length of intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stay between
groups treated with IHD versus CRRT. Table 15-2 lists the advantages and
disadvantages of the different modalities.
304

The principles of hemodialysis and PD are discussed in other chapters.
This section will focus primarily on CRRT, and how this modality
compares with IHD in AKI.
SLED will also be discussed briefly.
Dosing of RRT
Evidence from end-stage renal disease patients suggests that a thriceweekly regimen for IHD, a urea reduction ratio (URR) of ∼65% to
68% per session, is considered adequate dialysis. This correlates to a
fractional urea clearance (Kt/Vurea) of 1.2, where K is the dialyzer
efficiency, t is the time of treatment, and V is the volume of distribution
of urea.8
Given the acuity of the AKI population, urea clearances are notoriously
unreliable, with frequent volume shifts, sepsis, high catabolic state, and
so forth.

305

The current acute dialysis quality initiative recommendation is to
prescribe at least a single-pool Kt/Vurea of 1.3 for each dialysis
treatment in AKI.
This is based on the assumption that AKI patients should at least receive
the dose recommended for end-stage renal disease patients.
However, studies have shown that even this dose is rarely achieved in
AKI.
It has been proposed that benefit may be derived from increasing the
renal replacement dose with higher treatment doses, more frequent
treatments, or increasing flow rates in CRRT.
306

A small study published in 2001 suggested that short daily dialysis
improved mortality in AKI compared with three times per week dialysis
(28% vs. 46%). However, the Kt/Vurea obtained per session was <1.0,
suggesting inadequate dialysis.9
In CRRT, one single-center study demonstrated a survival advantage in
critically ill patients who underwent intensive CRRT (35 mL/kg/h vs. 20
mL/kg/h).10
Two large multi-center trials addressing the question of dosing of RRT in
AKI have recently been published.
The acute renal failure trial network (ATN) study published in 2008
demonstrated no survival benefit in AKI with more intensive therapy
(IHD six times per week with Kt/Vurea of 1.3 per session or continuous
venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at 35 mL/kg/h) compared to
less intensive therapy (IHD three times per week or CVVHDF at 20
mL/kg/h).11
The randomized evaluation of normal versus augmented level
replacement therapy (RENAL) study evaluated CVVHDF with effluent
flow rates of
40 mL/kg/h in the high-dose group versus 25 mL/kg/h in the low-dose
group. There was no difference in 90-day mortality between the two
arms.12
On the basis of the existing data, the current recommendation is to
prescribe CRRT at 20 to 25 mL/kg/h.
If prescribed therapy is not being delivered at least 80% of the time
because of interruptions (machine malfunction, catheter malfunction,
patient interruption for procedures), then the prescription dose can be
increased to take this into account.
IHD should be prescribed to achieve a URR of 70% (Kt/Vurea of 1.3) per
treatment, three times per week.
URR should be performed during each treatment, and subsequent dialysis
307

treatment should be adjusted (change of duration, dialysis filter, blood
flow, and so forth, to improve adequacy) accordingly.

CONTINUOUS RRT
Principles of CRRT
CRRT utilizes the principles of diffusion, convection, or both,
depending on the modality.
Diffusion:
This involves the same principles as dialysis and drives solutes such as
urea across the dialysis membrane from the blood (higher concentration)
to the dialysate (lower concentration), which is running countercurrent to
the blood.
The dialysate flow rate is ∼15 to 40 mL/min compared with dialysate
flow rate in IHD of 300 to 450 mL/min.
This process is called CVVHD.
Convection:
During convection, solute movement across the membrane is driven by
solvent drag.
The plasma water is pushed across the membrane by filtrating pressure
and takes solutes with it, similar to glomerular ultrafiltration.
This large volume loss has to be restored with necessary solutes, and
therefore convection requires the addition of replacement fluid solution
to the CRRT setup.
This is called CVVH.
Diffusion and convection:
The combination of the two processes utilizes both dialysate and
308

replacement fluid solutions and is termed CVVHDF.

Ultrafiltration:
CRRT also can be used without dialysate or replacement fluid to treat
volume overload with minimal solute clearance. This process is called
slow continuous ultrafiltration. The nomenclature of CRRT is outlined in
Table 15-3.
Some of the membranes used for CRRT also have adsorptive properties,
but it is unclear to what extent this results in significant clearance of
substances.
Studies have suggested that adsorption with polysulfone membranes
might result in clearance of cytokines, but, to date, this has not been
demonstrated to have clinical benefit.
Fluids in CRRT
Bicarbonate-based solutions have essentially replaced lactate-based
solutions in CRRT.
Bicarbonate-based solutions are either prepared at individual institutions
by the pharmacy or supplied premixed by various manufacturers.
Even if they are provided by manufacturers, the final constitution of the
309

fluid is conducted by the local pharmacy as various products have
different compositions and mixing instructions.
The typical concentrations of solutes in the solution is given below:
Bicarbonate concentration is ∼35 mEq/L.
Sodium is 140 mEq/L.
Chloride is ∼106 to 109 mEq/L.
Magnesium is ∼1.0 to 1.5 mEq/L.
Potassium concentrations vary and the prescription should reflect the
patient’s serum levels.
Calcium concentration should be zero if citrate anticoagulation is used
and calcium should be replaced through a central venous catheter.
Anticoagulation in CRRT
Slow continuous blood flow through extracorporeal circulation mandates
the use of anticoagulation to prevent platelet activation and thrombosis
of the circuit.
The primary goal of anticoagulation is to prevent clotting of the tubes
and filters, thereby ensuring the delivery of prescribed therapy.
Currently, the two primary methods of anticoagulation utilized in the
United States are:
Intravenous heparin (either provided through the circuit or
systemically) to maintain partial thromboplastin time (PTT) between 60
and 80 seconds.
Citrate anticoagulation:
There are different ways of administering citrate, but the principles
remain the same.
310

Citrate administered prefilter chelates the ionized calcium extracorporeal
circuit.
Calcium is an essential cofactor for the coagulation cascade and its
deficiency prevents coagulation in the circuit.
To counteract the effect of citrate in the systemic circulation, calcium is
given via a central venous catheter to maintain blood-ionized calcium
in the normal range.
It is of utmost importance to closely monitor ionized calcium levels
during citrate anticoagulation.
Other methods of anticoagulation used include argatroban and
bivalirudin, usually reserved for patients who develop heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT).
Typical Regimen for CRRT
An example of CRRT orders for a 70-kg patient, assuming 20 mL/kg/h of
replacement fluid and dialysate, serum potassium of 4 mEq/L, is given
below:
Blood flow 180 mL/min
Dialysate flow rate 700 mL/hour—Replacement fluid flow rate 700
mL/hour
Heparin bolus xx* units loading dose IV, then infusion (1000 units/mL)
at xx mL/h
Heparin should be individualized for the patient. Patients at high risk for
bleeding should not receive heparin or target PTT should be lower.
Dialysate (bicarbonate-based solution), 0 K, 3.5 Ca—add KCl to make
the final concentration of K 3 mEq/L
Replacement fluid (bicarbonate-based solution), 0 K, 3.5 Ca—add
enough KCl to make the final concentration of K 3 mEq/L
311

Drug Dosing in CRRT
Total clearance of any compound depends on its elimination by nonrenal
route, residual renal function, and CRRT.
Unlike IHD, the clearance of medications is continuous, controlled, and
somewhat predictable if the patients remain on continuous therapy.
Patient, drug, and dialysis characteristics determine appropriate dosing
schedules to be used.
Generally, the nonrenal clearance is taken to be constant, although in
critically ill patients with multiorgan system failure, this component may
be less than predicted.
The CRRT clearance relies on convection, diffusion, and adsorption.

Convective elimination is determined primarily by the protein-bound
fraction of the drug.
In diffusive elimination, the saturation of the drug in the dialysate (and
filtrate) becomes important, and decreases as flow rates increase.
By taking these guidelines into consideration, therapeutic doses have
been calculated for a variety of drugs used in the ICU. The recommended
312

doses of some of the more commonly prescribed antibiotics are listed in
Table 15-4.
Complications of CRRT
As with any procedure, there are certain complications and adverse
events that can be associated with renal replacement therapies.
Vigilance for such complications and their immediate rectification are
essential to prevent life-threatening situations, especially in the
vulnerable population of the ICU.
Some are related to the procedure itself, whereas others are a result of
fluid removal or electrolyte and acid–base disturbances.
In addition, the necessity for a central venous catheter places the patient
at risk for infection complications.
Hypotension:
Hypotension can occur in all clinical settings with all modalities,
although it is more commonly seen with IHD and its rapid fluid shifts.
Volume-depleted and septic patients are at heightened risk; careful
attention to the physical examination and invasive hemodynamic
monitoring when indicated can help ensure adequate volume
resuscitation prior to initiating the dialysis session.
A target central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg can be used in these
settings and may dictate a reduction or stoppage of fluid ultrafiltration.
Alternatively, if pulmonary edema or acute lung injury is complicating
the picture, then pressor support can be used to maintain blood pressure
while continuing ultrafiltration with CRRT. However, this must be done
with extreme caution given the risk of peripheral ischemia.
Arrhythmias:
Cardiac arrhythmias can occur in the setting of RRT and electrolyte
313

shifts.
Although generally seen with IHD, arrhythmia can also be seen in CRRT.
Potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels must be monitored
every 12 to 24 hours during CRRT. If 0 or 1 mEq/L of potassium
concentration is being used, then potassium should be monitored every 6
to 8 hours to ensure stable potassium plasma concentration.
Patients on digitalis are especially sensitive to hypokalemia. Potassium
competes with digitalis for binding at the Na +/K+-ATPase pump, and
reduced serum levels can enhance the medicine’s toxicity.
Supraventricular arrhythmias can also be triggered during the placement
of the dialysis catheter or by a malpositioned dialysis catheter.
If the arrhythmia is resulting in hemodynamic compromise, then therapy
is discontinued immediately and appropriate measures to treat the
arrhythmia should be started.
Central venous catheter problems:
CRRT requires the insertion of a nontunneled, large-bore, dual-lumen,
central venous catheter into either the internal jugular, subclavian, or
femoral veins.
Nontunneled catheters are typically placed at the bedside into a central
vein and ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended to reduce
complications such as bleeding and infections.
Sterile precautions should be mandatory during placement of central
venous catheters.
Immediate risks include bleeding, injury to other organs or vessels (e.g.,
pneumothorax, carotid artery injury), and malposition of the catheter.
Infection risks increase after 3 weeks for internal jugular vein catheters
and after 1 week for femoral vein catheters in bed-bound patients.13
314

When infection and bacteremia occur, prompt catheter removal is
generally recommended, unless vascular access is especially difficult.
Persistent bacteremia, fever, or an elevated white blood cell count should
prompt a search for bacterial endocarditis in this particularly susceptible
population.
Thrombus or fibrin sheaths can form around or inside the catheters,
causing inadequate blood flows for dialysis. Although heparin is usually
instilled into the hub of the catheter after each dialysis, this does not
necessarily prevent clot formation. An attempt at clot lysis can be made
by the local instillation of alteplase (2 mg). Alteplase should not be
administered systemically for this purpose.
If the catheter malfunctions, then it may be changed over a guidewire or
replaced, preferably at a different site.
In patients with chronic kidney disease, subclavian veins are not used for
dialysis catheters, as there is a high risk of subclavian venous stenosis,
which can prevent the future placement of an arteriovenous fistula for
dialysis in that extremity.
Tunneled catheters maybe more beneficial in reducing infection rates,
but nontunneled catheters are considered first line due to the ease of
placement. Tunneled catheters are typically used in patients with
multiple malfunctioning temporary catheters, or in those with poor
chance for early renal recovery, or in those being transferred out of the
institution to a different facility.
Interventional radiology or nephrology consultation is required to
perform endoluminal brushing to dislodge thrombi and fibrin sheaths in
malfunctioning tunneled catheters.14
Electrolyte disturbances:
Standard CRRT solutions do not contain phosphate, and uninterrupted
CRRT can cause dramatic hypophosphatemia, especially during highdose therapy.11

315

This problem is aggravated by an intracellular shift that occurs during
dialysis secondary to alkalemia.
Hypophosphatemia can be corrected by intravenous or oral repletion.
Alternatively, phosphorus can be added to the dialysate solution,
although this technique is not employed widely at this time.
Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can also result from CRRT, and
serum electrolytes need to be monitored at least twice a day to avoid such
complications.
Hypomagnesemia is usually replaced intravenously or orally.
Hypokalemia can be treated by increasing the concentration of
potassium in the dialysate and replacement fluid. The typical
concentration of potassium in the solution is 2 mEq/L. However,
potassium can be added by the pharmacist to make the final
concentration 3 or 4 mEq/L, depending on serum potassium levels.
Anticoagulation problems:
The use of anticoagulant increases the risk for hemorrhagic episodes.
Studies have shown higher incidence with heparin compared with citrate;
therefore, citrate should be used preferentially in patients who are at
higher risk for bleeding.
If a major bleed occurs, then use of heparin or other systemic
anticoagulants should be immediately discontinued. Citrate
anticoagulation can be continued, with close attention to bleeding
parameters and ionized calcium levels.
Heparin can also be associated with HIT. If HIT is suspected, heparin
should be discontinued and alternative agents such as argatroban,
bivalirudin, or citrate should be used. The direct thrombin inhibitor,
argatroban, can be initiated at 2 μg/kg/min and adjusted to maintain an
activated partial thromboplastin time of 1.5 to 3 times the baseline value.
Citrate anticoagulation can result in metabolic alkalosis, and in the
316

setting of hepatic dysfunction, can lead to life-threatening hypocalcemia.
The titration protocol for addressing changes in serum and machineionized calcium levels must be closely followed to prevent adverse events.
Metabolic alkalosis can be treated by changing the replacement fluid to
sodium chloride from a bicarbonate-based product, and hypocalcemia is
treated by adjusting the calcium rates.
Hypothermia:
Hypothermia is a frequent complication of CRRT, especially at higher
flow rates of dialysate and replacement fluid, with an incidence as high
as 60% to 70%.
Significant amounts of heat are lost from the slow-flowing
extracorporeal circuit and can cause decreases in body temperature of 2
to 5°C.
Hypothermia can result in cardiac arrhythmias, hemodynamic
compromise, increased risk for infections, and coagulation problems.
This can be addressed by encasing the venous tubing (blood
returning to the patient) with specialized warming devices that can be
attached to the machine.

SUSTAINED LOW-EFFICIENCY DIALYSIS
SLED (slow ED) combines the benefits of CRRT and IHD.
The dialysate flow rates are usually ∼100 to 200 mL/min, similar to
the blood flow rates, and the procedure lasts anywhere from 10 to 12
hours.
SLED is performed by the dialysis nursing staff and utilizes a modified
dialysis machine. It typically does not require replacement fluids or
special filters or machines. However, it can also be performed by certain
machines that are typically considered as CRRT machines. In these cases,
bicarbonate-based solutions are used as dialysate.
317

Anticoagulation is usually required, although in our experience, during
SLED therapy with NxStage®, anticoagulation is not required in ∼75% of
the cases.
The therapy is associated with fewer hemodynamic alterations
compared with IHD, and because the procedure can be performed at
night in the ICU, it leaves the day for various procedures such as imaging
studies or surgeries. This is a clear advantage over CRRT, where stopping
the therapy for various reasons prevents adequate delivery of dialysis.
SLED has been shown to provide adequate urea clearance and has been
successfully used in critically ill patients with AKI.15 More centers are
using this option in addition to CRRT and IHD in the treatment of
critically ill patients with AKI.
The clearances of various drugs during SLED have not been established. It
is recommended to give drugs after the procedure, and levels, whenever
available, should be monitored closely.

Overview and Approach to the Patient with Glomerular Disease
Syed A. Khalid

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Glomerular diseases are a heterogeneous collection of inflammatory
and/or noninflammatory insults to the filtering unit of the kidney.1
The hallmark of glomerular disease is an alteration in glomerular
permeability and selectivity, resulting in proteinuria and/or hematuria.
Glomerular diseases occurring in the absence of a known systemic
process are called primary.
Secondary glomerular diseases are caused by systemic disease
processes. Examples include diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus, certain
cancers, or vasculitis.
Secondary glomerular diseases often present in a similar fashion to
primary glomerular diseases and their pathological and clinical picture
may be indistinguishable (e.g., primary focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) vs. FSGS caused by obesity).2
Sometimes glomerular pathology may be the first manifestation of
systemic disease (membranous nephropathy in cancers). Many systemic
diseases may be diagnosed on renal biopsy (amyloidosis, drug reactions,
sarcoidosis), and in some, the biopsy results indicate disease activity and
guide treatment (lupus nephritis). Table 16-1 illustrates the primary
pathology and secondary causes of glomerular diseases.

CLASSIFICATION OF GLOMERULAR DISEASES
Glomerular diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and
histomorphological appearance.

320

Classification of glomerular diseases is based on histological injury
patterns, with evaluation by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and
electron microscopy (EM).
One pattern can have multiple etiological causes such as
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and one etiology can
give different histological patterns (e.g., hepatitis B- and C-associated
glomerular diseases, lupus nephritis); hence, all histologies must be
evaluated with clinical correlations.
Light Microscopy
Light microscopy is useful for determining pattern of disease, cellularity,
and assessment of interstitium and vessels.
Standard slide preparation includes staining with hematoxylin and eosin,
periodic acid-Schiff, trichrome, and a silver stain.
The glomerulus consists of four regions: Bowman’s capsule and space,
arterioles, the mesangium, and the glomerular capillary wall (Fig. 161A).

321

323

Wegener’s granulomatosis. (Courtesy of Dr. H. Liapis.)
The latter consists of endothelium, basement membrane, epithelium, and
podocytes.
A normal glomerulus has entire loops that are patent and
approximately two to three mesangial cells per capillary tuft.
The basement membrane is about the same thickness as a proximal
tubule basement membrane. Bowman’s capsule has one layer of cells and
Bowman’s space is empty.
The lesions in glomerular diseases can be diffuse (affecting the majority
of glomeruli) or focal (only some of the glomeruli).
They also can be segmental (only part of a glomerulus involved) or
global (affecting all regions of any given glomerulus). The best example
of a segmental disease would be FSGS (Fig. 16-1E).
Lesions also can be hypercellular or proliferative due to mesangial
proliferation (IgA nephropathy) or infiltrative due to inflammatory cells
(leukocytes, monocytes, neutrophils) (Fig. 16-1B and 16-1C).
The mesangium is composed of cells and matrix. It may expand because
of mesangial cell proliferation (hypercellularity), as seen in IgA
nephropathy or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Matrix expansion can be seen in diabetic nephropathy or be due to
matrix infiltration by abnormal proteins (amyloidosis, fibrillary
glomerulonephritis).
Crescent formation refers to cellular or fibrous crescents formed by
invasion of cells (proliferating parietal epithelial cells, invading
inflammatory cells, and fibrous products of those cells) into Bowman’s
space, resulting from severe glomerular injury with capillary leak of cells
and proteins (Fig. 16-1F).
Basement membrane proliferation can be assessed by the silver stain.
Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is seen in
324

membranous nephropathy or class V lupus nephritis (Fig. 16-1D).
Tubulointerstitial inflammation usually accompanies acute glomerular
injury. Interstitial fibrosis is usually a poor prognostic sign and is
consistent with irreversible damage.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence studies include staining for deposition of IgG, IgA,
IgM, and components of classic and alternative complement pathways
(C3, C4, and C1q).
Staining patterns are linear (continuous staining along the glomerular
capillary wall) or granular (discontinuous staining along the capillary
wall or in the mesangium) (Fig. 16-2).
Putative antigens are not known in most cases, but there are some
exceptions (e.g., anti-GBM disease).
Several glomerular diseases are diagnosed primarily by
immunofluorescent staining. Examples are IgA nephropathy and C1q
nephropathy.
Electron Microscopy
EM can detect GBM thickness, duplication, infiltration, and podocyte foot
process effacement.
Precise localization of immune deposits that appear to be homogeneous
and electron dense (subepithelial, subendothelial, mesangial, or within
the GBM) is critical for the classification of most primary glomerular
renal diseases.

Dr. H. Liapis.)
Thin basement membrane disease and Alport’s syndrome (hereditary
nephritis) can be diagnosed by demonstration of abnormally thin areas of
basement membrane.
Fibrillary glomerulopathies and amyloidosis can be diagnosed by EM,
depending on the fibrils that are seen.

PRESENTATION OF GLOMERULAR DISEASES
Clinical Presentations
Patients with glomerular diseases generally present with one of the
following clinical syndromes. Often there is signi cant overlap between
the proteinuric and hematuric disorders (Fig. 16-3).
Asymptomatic Hematuria
This syndrome is defined as >2 to 3 red blood cells (RBCs) per highpower field in spun urine (microscopic), or painless brown/red
macroscopic hematuria without clots in patients who have normal renal
326

function and no evidence of systemic diseases known to affect kidneys.
The differential diagnosis is broad and urological problems (bladder,
prostate, urethra, stones, and renal tumors) account for up to 80% of all
cases of hematuria.
The presence of RBC casts and/or dysmorphic RBCs indicates a
glomerular cause for the hematuria.
The most common diseases presenting as asymptomatic hematuria are
thin basement membrane disease, IgA nephropathy, hereditary nephritis,
and sickle-cell disease.

FIGURE 16-3. Spectrum of glomerular diseases with nephrotic and
nephritic features. FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; GBM,
327

glomerular basement membrane; GN, glomerulonephritis; strep,
streptococcal.
Kidney biopsy is usually not done to evaluate asymptomatic hematuria,
unless there is concern for an unexplained systemic process that might
warrant therapy.3,4
Asymptomatic Proteinuria
Proteinuria in the range of 150 mg to 3 g/d (in 24-hour urine
collection) or as measured as spot protein-to-creatinine ratio ranging
from 0.2 to 3 g protein per gram creatinine is usually asymptomatic.
It is sometimes referred to as nonnephrotic proteinuria.
It may occur with glomerular or nonglomerular diseases such as
tubulointerstitial diseases or orthostatic proteinuria (usually <1 g/d).
Any type of glomerular disease can cause proteinuria in this range with
FSGS, membranous nephropathy, and diabetic nephropathy being
common examples.3,4
Nephrotic Syndrome
This syndrome is a clinical pentad of proteinuria >3 g/d,
hypoalbuminemia <3.5 g/dL, edema, hypercholesterolemia, and
lipiduria (most specific finding is presence of oval fat bodies in
urinalysis). Complications of nephrotic syndrome include:
Hypercoagulability due to loss of hemostasis control proteins such as
antithrombin III and increased hepatic synthesis of protein C, fibrinogen,
and von Willebrand factor. Venous thrombosis is more common than
arterial thrombosis.
Infection due to loss of immunoglobulins and immunosuppressive drugs
Hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis
The most common glomerular diseases presenting as nephrotic
syndrome are primary diseases such as minimal change disease,
328

membranous nephropathy, and FSGS, as well as secondary forms such as
diabetic nephropathy, amyloidosis, and light-chain deposition disease.4,5
Nephritic Syndrome
This syndrome presents gross or microscopic hematuria with
dysmorphic RBCs and/or RBC casts, hypertension, and reduction in
glomerular filtration rate with or without oliguria. Proteinuria
(usually nonnephrotic) and edema may also be present.
Distinction between nephrotic and nephritic syndromes is usually based
on clinical and laboratory evaluation.
The most common diseases presenting as nephritic syndrome are
poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, other postinfectious diseases
(endocarditis, abscess), IgA nephropathy, vasculitis, and lupus nephritis.
Generally, diseases presenting with nephritic syndrome tend be acute
and rapidly progressive, and time is of essence in diagnosis and early
treatment, so as to avoid chronic renal damage.3,6
Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis
This presentation is the most severe form of the nephritic syndromes.
In this case, glomerular injury is so acute that renal failure develops over
the course of a few days to weeks.
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) usually presents as
proteinuria <3 g/d and hematuria with dysmorphic RBCs and/or red cell
casts, with or without signs of systemic vasculitis.
A specific finding on kidney biopsy is crescent formation. RPGN can
progress to end-stage renal disease in most untreated patients within a
period of weeks to months.
RPGN is usually due to one of the following disorders, which reflect
different mechanisms of glomerular injury. It is classified into four types.
329

Type 1: Anti-GBM disease
Type 1 refers to anti-GBM antibody disease.
Anti-GBM antibody disease in the setting of pulmonary involvement is
known as Goodpasture’s syndrome.
The immunofluorescence pattern shows positivity with antibody to IgG
and has a smooth, diffuse, linear pattern (ribbon-like appearance).
Serologic testing for anti-GBM in patient serum is often positive.
Type 2: Immune complex glomerulonephritis
Type 2 refers to immune complex RPGN.
Examples include mesangial IgA deposits in IgA nephropathy,
antistreptococcal antibodies and subepithelial humps in postinfectious
glomerulonephritis, antinuclear antibodies and subendothelial deposits in
lupus nephritis, and circulating cryoglobulins and intraluminal “thrombi”
in mixed cryoglobulinemia.
Type 3: Pauci-immune
Type 3 refers to pauci-immune RPGN, in which there is a necrotizing
glomerulonephritis but few or no immune deposits by
immunofluorescence or EM.
The majority of patients with renal-limited vasculitis are antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positive, with 75% to 80% having
myeloperoxidase-ANCA, and many have or will develop the systemic
symptoms of a vasculitis.
Patients with ANCA-negative, pauci-immune RPGN are also considered
part of this spectrum.
Type 4: Double–antibody-positive disease
Type 4 has features of both types 1 and 3. This is also called “double–
330

antibody”-positive disease.
Chronic Glomerulonephritis
This terminology is sometimes used to describe patients thought to
have some form of previous glomerular disease presenting with
hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), proteinuria >3 g/d,
and small, atrophic, smooth kidneys on ultrasound.
Any glomerulonephritis can slowly progress to kidney failure; hence,
chronic glomerulonephritis may be the presumptive diagnosis when
patients present with shrunken kidneys and biopsy is not appropriate.
History and Physical Examination
Patients with nephrotic syndrome usually complain of pitting edema
(especially periorbital) and foamy urine.
Physical examination may reveal xanthelasma, Muehrke bands (white
bands in fingernails from chronic hypoalbuminemia), and elevated blood
pressure, along with signs of volume overload.
Patients with nephritic syndrome may complain of decreased urine
output and uremic symptoms that are often vague (nausea, vomiting,
fatigue, headaches, and anorexia).
Other findings in nephritic syndrome include elevated blood pressure,
gross hematuria (“tea-colored urine”), and generalized edema.
If the patient has a RPGN, he may have systemic symptoms of vasculitis
—rash, fevers, and pulmonary symptoms (pulmonary-renal syndrome).
Timing of recent infections can be very helpful. In a patient with
hematuria, it is important to know about timing of recent infections. IgA
nephropathy patients will have hematuria within 1 to 3 days after
onset of upper respiratory tract infection (synpharyngitic hematuria).
In contrast, hematuria from postinfectious glomerulonephritis will
develop 1 to 2 weeks after the
streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection or up to 6 weeks after a
331

skin infection.
Family history of renal failure and deafness may suggest Alport’s
syndrome. Family history of thin basement membrane disease, IgA
nephropathy, FSGS, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome is important because
those diseases may be inherited.
Medications should be evaluated. Prescriptions, over-the-counter
medications, and herbal preparations should be reviewed. Particular
attention should be paid to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs and antibiotics.
Malignancies (Hodgkin disease; graft-versus-host disease after bone
marrow transplant; solid tumors of lung, breast, and colon) are also
associated with glomerular disease, and renal disease may be the initial
presentation.3
Laboratory Evaluation
The routine initial evaluation of patients with suspected glomerular
disease should include the following tests:
Urinalysis: The presence of protein and/or RBCs on microscopic exam of
the urine sediment is helpful. RBC casts or dysmorphic RBCs are specific
for glomerular disease and always warrant further testing. The presence
of other formed elements in urine (e.g., granular casts, WBCs, WBC casts)
is less specific. Oval fat bodies, fatty casts, and hyaline casts may be seen
in the urine sediment of patients with nephrotic syndrome.
Serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen should be measured.
Prior values may be important to determine the duration of disease.
Urine protein quantification: Spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio
provides a rough estimation of 24-hour urine protein excretion in g/d. A
24-hour urine collection for protein and Cr can provide more precise
quantification of both protein excretion and estimation of Cr clearance
(see Chap. 4).

332

Urine culture: Patients with hematuria should have a urine culture to
rule out cystitis or prostatitis.
Renal ultrasound:
Patients with hematuria should undergo kidney ultrasound to evaluate
for anatomical abnormalities such as polycystic kidney disease, cysts,
renal masses, stones, and kidney size.
The presence of atrophic smooth kidneys (<9 cm) suggests CKD, which
is usually irreversible. This finding should limit use of aggressive
diagnostic workup (including renal biopsy, which carries greater risk
with small, scarred kidneys) and aggressive immunosuppressive
therapies.
Large kidneys (>13 cm) can be associated with diabetes nephropathy,
amyloid or lymphoma infiltration, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
associated nephropathy, or other glomerulonephritis or interstitial
nephritis.3
Specialized Laboratory Evaluation
Several serologic studies should be considered in all nephritic
presentations, nephrotic syndrome, and in selected patients with
proteinuria and/or hematuria.
The decision as to which of these tests to order in a particular patient
depend on the age, gender, and features of the presentation.
A “shot-gun” approach, in which all the laboratory studies are ordered
with no regard to clinical findings, is not recommended, as it can lead to
further inappropriate testing and significantly increase the healthcare
costs.
Antinuclear antibody and anti–double-stranded-DNA antibody tests
evaluate the presence of SLE.
Cryoglobulins and rheumatoid factor should be measured to support a
diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia.
333

Anti-GBM antibodies support a diagnosis of Goodpasture’s disease.
ANCAs: Cytoplasmic ANCA (C-ANCA)/Proteinase 3 (PR3) are typically
positive in Wegener’s granulomatosis, and perinuclearANCA/myeloperoxidase are often present in microscopic polyangiitis and
Churg–Strauss syndrome.
Antistreptolysin-O antibody and Anti-DNAse B in poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis. Other streptococcal antibodies are also available.
Hepatitis B and C serologies: Infections with these viruses have been
associated with MPGN, membranous nephropathy, vasculitis, and
cryoglobulinemia.
HIV antibodies for HIV-associated nephropathy should also be
measured.
Serum protein electrophoresis/urine protein electrophoresis and
immunofixation can detect light-chain or heavy-chain paraproteins that
are commonly seen in amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, or light-chain
deposition disease.
Complement levels (C3, C4, and CH50) are decreased in a
limited spectrum of diseases and can be useful in limiting the differential
diagnosis (Table 16-2).3,4
Kidney Biopsy
A kidney biopsy is required to establish diagnosis and treatment of most
glomerular diseases. Figure 16-4 gives a broad algorithm to the
management of patient with glomerular disease.
Biopsy is usually not required in the following special patient groups:
Children who present with features typical of minimal change disease
and who respond appropriately to steroid trial.

findings such as positive antistreptolysin antibody, antihyalurinidase
antibody, or anti-DNAase.
Mild, asymptomatic urine abnormalities (microscopic hematuria,
nonnephrotic proteinuria) with preserved renal function. These patients
have excellent prognosis, and biopsy results would be unlikely to alter
management.

TREATMENT
Treatment consists of disease-specific treatment and symptomatic
and supportive treatment of proteinuria, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
and control of edema.
Patients with proteinuria should be treated with angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) to
reduce proteinuria to <1 g/d. Use caution with these agents in patients
with accelerating renal failure or a tendency toward hyperkalemia.
Serum chemistries, including potassium and Cr, should be monitored
within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy. Creatinine increases of up to
30% from baseline are acceptable after initiation of these agents.
Control of blood pressure is essential in order to preserve kidney
function. Blood pressure should be controlled, with a goal of <135/80
mm Hg. In patients with proteinuria, ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be
the first-line therapy.
Control of edema or volume overload requires the use of dietary salt
and water restriction in conjunction with diuretics. Loop diuretics are
the most effective agents.
Treatment of hyperlipidemia usually consists of hydroxymethylglutaryl
coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins). Most patients with nephrotic
syndrome should be on statin therapy to prevent coronary and other
336

atherosclerotic long-term complications.
Disease-specific therapy is most often guided by results of renal biopsy
and by supplemental laboratory evaluation.
A final decision regarding the initiation and intensity of
immunosuppressive therapy and use of other potentially toxic agents
must include consideration of the patient’s age and comorbid conditions,
the likelihood of reversibility of the kidney disease, and compliance with
the medical regimen. These therapies will be discussed in the next several
chapters on primary and secondary glomerular diseases.

PREVENTION OF COMPLICATIONS OF
IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE REGIMENS
Infection
It is clear that the risk of infections is increased with immunosuppressive
therapies.
Much of the data for prevention of infection during immunosuppression
are derived from the solid organ transplant literature. The following
options should be considered when treating glomerular diseases.
The intensity of immunosuppression and other patient risk factors should
also be factored into the decision, when deciding on prophylaxis.
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80 mg/400 mg) one tablet daily for
prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci
Low-dose acyclovir, 200 mg daily for prevention of herpes zoster
Vaccination for Pneumococci and influenza is advised to prevent fatal
infections.7
Monitoring for the development of oropharyngeal thrush, which is
usually treatable with nystatin oral suspension.
Other Medical Complications
337

Histamine-2 blockers to prevent steroid-induced gastritis.
Calcium supplementation and vitamin D therapy for the prevention of
osteoporosis in patients requiring prolonged courses of corticosteroids.
Bisphosphonates may be required in patients with osteopenia, but has to
be used with caution in the setting of CKD.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (leuprolide) to suppress
gonadal function (to protect against gonadal failure before treatment
with cytotoxic agents) where indicated.
Although patients with hypoalbuminemia due to nephrotic syndrome
are at much higher risk to develop thromboembolic events,
prophylactic anticoagulation is controversial. If there is documented
thrombosis, the patient should receive long-term anticoagulation during
the course of the disease.8
Adverse effects of disease-specific therapy should be considered in all
patients receiving aggressive immunosuppressive regimens for the
treatment of glomerular diseases.
Some adverse effects of high-dose corticosteroids include:
Steroid-induced osteoporosis
Glucose intolerance
Worsening diabetic control
Opportunistic infections
Change in body fat distribution, striae, and cushingoid facies
Cyclosporin carries the following adverse effects:
Nephrotoxicity requires monitoring of serum Cr. Trough levels of
cyclosporine A between 70 and 120 ng/mL may reduce the chances of
nephrotoxicity.

338

Glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia
Multiple drug interactions
Use of cyclophosphamide may cause the following effects:
Leukopenia is common with some therapies, and the WBC count should
be monitored every 1 to 2 weeks.
During therapy with cyclophosphamide, the dose should be held if the
absolute neutrophil count falls to <2000 per μL and restarted at a lower
dose when leukocyte counts recover.
Hemorrhagic cystitis incidence can be reduced by aggressive hydration
with a daily urine output of >2000 mL/d and with 2-mercaptoethane
sulfonate sodium given concomitantly with cyclophosphamide. This agent
binds toxic metabolites in the bladder and may be used to reduce cystitis
risk.
Irreversible gonadal failure incidence may be reduced with pretreatment
with leuprolide to suppress gonadal function.
Hair thinning
Increased risk of bladder cancer
Nausea and vomiting
Mycophenolate mofetil use places the patient at risk for the following:
Increased risk of lymphoma or other malignancies
Neutropenia
Gastrointestinal distress, diarrhea
Azathioprine use carries the following risks:
Leukopenia
339

Malignancies, especially skin cancer and lymphoma
Rituximab is associated with the following adverse effects:
Severe infusion reactions within the first 24 hours after start of the
infusion, including angioedema and bronchospasm
Lymphopenia
Neutropenia
Prolonged pancytopenia

Primary Glomerulopathies
Ying Chen

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary glomerular diseases are a group of disorders in which the
main manifestations of disease are directly related to kidney involvement
rather than as part of a systemic disease process. Systemic diseases
associated with glomerular disease are discussed in a separate chapter.
Primary glomerular diseases can present with nephrotic syndrome,
asymptomatic proteinuria, isolated hematuria, or a nephritic
picture. In many cases, they are described as being idiopathic without
known association or cause. For each of the primary glomerulopathies,
secondary causes are also discussed. For instance, medications, infections,
and malignancies are all associated with glomerular pathology that is
otherwise indistinguishable from the idiopathic forms.
Proper diagnosis and management of the primary glomerulopathies
requires an understanding of patient characteristics, risk of progressive
kidney disease, and safe use of immunosuppressive agents.
These cases should be managed in conjunction with a physician
experienced in the evaluation and management of glomerular kidney
disorders.

FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) has become the most
important form of primary glomerular disease, both because of
increasing incidence and because of its contribution to the growth of endstage renal disease (ESRD).
342

In the United States, FSGS is the most common cause of idiopathic
nephrotic syndrome in adult African Americans. Idiopathic FSGS is also
the most common primary glomerular disease detected on renal biopsy
that leads to ESRD in all races.
FSGS is a group of disorders that shares several histologic features. Renal
biopsy shows some glomeruli (focal) with sclerosis in part of the
glomerular tuft (segmental). Patients with these abnormalities often
present with nephrotic syndrome, but may also have asymptomatic
proteinuria.
Several means of categorizing FSGS are in use.
FSGS can be described as a primary or secondary disorder associated
with a range of causes and potential differences in treatment. For
instance, primary FSGS is usually treated with corticosteroids or
immunosuppressive regimens, whereas secondary disease typically does
not respond to this
regimen.

343

Histologic variants have been described that take into account
subglomerular localization of the sclerotic lesion, presence of
proliferation, and presence of glomerular capillary collapse. The value of
this system is thought to arise from better prediction of causation and
outcomes.1
The collapsing FSGS variant is associated with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and some drug-associated diseases. Of all
the histologic variants, collapsing FSGS is notable for a poor renal
prognosis.2
Patients with the tip lesion pattern of FSGS have the most favorable
outcome.
Table 17-1 summarizes the histologic variants and some of their
associations.
In addition, a variant of FSGS has been termed C1q nephropathy.

PRIMARY IDIOPATHIC FSGS
Clinical Features
FSGS is responsible for ∼25% of kidney disease in a series of adults with
≥2 g of protein per 24 hours, and up to 35% if patients present with
nephrotic syndrome.
The disease is markedly more common in African Americans and the
mean age of onset in adults is 40 years.
Proteinuria is typically nonselective.
Secondary forms of FSGS typically have lower levels of proteinuria than
classic idiopathic FSGS.
Other common features on presentation are hypertension (30% to
50%), microscopic hematuria (25% to 75%), and renal insufficiency
(20% to 30%).
344

Serologic testing and complement levels should be normal.
Outcomes of Primary FSGS
Spontaneous remission of proteinuria is unusual (5% to 25%).3
Poor prognostic indicators are nephrotic range proteinuria or massive
proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine, greater degree of
tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and presence of collapsing lesions at the time
of biopsy, black race, and failure to achieve partial or complete
remission.
FSGS has a significant risk of progression to ESRD, with 5- and 10year renal survival rates of 76% and 57% in those initially presenting
with nephrotic syndrome.4
Nonnephrotic proteinuria is associated with >90% 10-year kidney
survival.
Treatment of Primary FSGS
There is still considerable debate over the appropriate treatment for
patients with FSGS.5
All nephrotic FSGS patients and those at risk of progressive disease
should be treated with corticosteroids.
Standard therapy is initiated with high-dose daily corticosteroids
(prednisone, 1 mg/kg of ideal body weight per day to maximum dose of
80 mg/d or 2 mg/kg alternate-day treatment).
Treatment with high-dose daily or alternate-day steroids should be
continued for 2 to 4 months with a prolonged course (6 to 9 months).6
The median duration of steroid treatment to achieve complete remission
is 3 to 4 months, with most patients responding by 6 months. However,
potential morbidities associated with steroid-related side effects need to
be considered if this approach is planned.
345

If remission occurs, the steroids may be tapered slowly. Longer courses
may be used in patients who achieve only partial remission or who
relapse with steroid tapering.
Cyclosporine (3.5 mg/kg ideal body weight per day in two divided
doses) and low dose (10 to 15 mg/d) prednisone for 6 months for
steroid-resistant FSGS have been studied by the North American
Collaborative Study of Cyclosporine in Nephrotic Syndrome.
The remission rate in this trial was >70% (complete and/or partial) in
steroid-resistant patients.
In addition to reduction in proteinuria, slower progression of kidney
disease was found.
Given the lesser toxicity profile, many clinicians believe that
cyclosporine or tacrolimus are better second-line agents than are
cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil.
However, relapse is common after cyclosporine is discontinued and
patients need to be followed closely for recurrence of nephrotic
syndrome.7
Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil can be added to the
corticosteroid regimen in patients with recurrent disease. These drugs
have not been tested in randomized controlled studies. About 15 to 20%
of steroid-resistant patients respond to these drugs.
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is being investigated in a large
multicenter National Institutes of Health trial in the United States
comparing cyclosporine and a regimen of oral MMF plus dexamethasone
for steroid-resistant patients with FSGS.
Recurrence of FSGS after renal transplantation is common (up to 30%)
and is associated with decreased graft survival. Plasmapheresis has been
used with limited success in the management of posttransplant FSGS
recurrence.8

346

SECONDARY FSGS
Etiology
FSGS represents a common phenotypic expression
clinicopathologic syndromes with distinct etiologies.

of

diverse

Genetic causes of FSGS:
Several genetic mutations are associated with FSGS. Most have been
related to defects in structural proteins of podocytes and slit diaphragms.
Mutations in the NHPS1 gene, which codes for nephrin, are responsible
for the autosomal recessive congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish
type. Compound heterozygous mutations in small numbers of tested
adults have been linked to steroid-resistant FSGS.9,10
Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, which codes for podocin, are responsible
for autosomal recessive steroid-resistant FSGS in children and rarely in
adults.
Autosomal dominant FSGS in children or adults is associated with
mutations in ACTN4, which encodes the podocyte cytoplasmic protein αactinin-4 as well as a mutation in the transient receptor potential cation
6 channel (TRPC6 channel).11,12
Viral infection:
HIV-associated nephropathy may occur at any time during the course
of HIV infection, although it is usually diagnosed when CD4 count falls
below 200.13
The glomerular disease appears to result from direct infection of
podocytes, leading to podocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation.
Up to 95% of HIV-associated nephropathy cases occur in young AfricanAmerican men with HIV infection contracted by any route (mean age,
33 years; male-to-female ratio, 10:1).
347

The clinical presentation includes nephrotic or nonnephrotic proteinuria,
progressive azotemia, and the relative rarity of hypertension.
Laboratory evaluation reveals HIV seropositivity, normal C3, normal C4,
and CD4 count usually <200.
Renal ultrasound typically shows enlarged kidneys with increased
echogenicity.
The pathology of HIV-associated nephropathy includes collapsing FSGS,
mesangial proliferation, hypertrophied podocytes with protein resorption
droplets, microcystic dilated tubules, and endothelial cell tubuloreticular
inclusions.
Parvovirus B19 infection has also been associated with collapsing FSGS.
Drugs:
Drugs associated with FSGS include pamidronate, heroin, lithium, and
interferon-α.
Pamidronate has been associated with the collapsing form.
Secondary FSGS was attributed to heroin use in older studies. These cases
presented with nephrotic syndrome and with rapid progression to ESRD.
More recent studies have shown that the incidence of heroin-associated
disease has declined markedly.
Sickle-cell nephropathy:
Kidney disease can occur in persons with sickle-cell disease.
The prevalence of proteinuria was 26% in one series.
Chronic kidney disease has been seen in 7% to 30% of patients with
long-term follow-up.
Hyperfiltration and increased glomerular pressure are thought to be the
mechanism for injury.
348

The most common lesion on kidney biopsy is FSGS, although other
histology can sometimes be found (e.g., membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis [MPGN]).
Other:
Reduced renal mass (unilateral renal agenesis, surgical renal ablation,
chronic allograft nephropathy, and chronic vesicoureteral reflux).
Secondary FSGS may also be seen in the setting of chronic
hypoperfusion and ischemia to the kidney. Some examples are
hypertension, morbid obesity, congenital cyanotic heart disease,
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and atheroemboli.
Treatment of Secondary FSGS
Therapy for the underlying disorder is first-line management. Lesions
of FSGS may regress with management of the underlying condition (e.g.,
treatment of obesity with bariatric surgery or continuous positive airway
pressure for OSA).
Nonspecific therapy to reduce edema and proteinuria with diuretics,
dietary sodium restriction, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy should be
aggressively pursued.
Steroid treatment as for idiopathic FSGS can be considered in refractory
cases, but limited data do not support the use of aggressive
immunosuppressive or cytotoxic agents.

OTHER FSGS VARIANTS: C1q NEPHROPATHY
Distinctive features of C1q nephropathy are a predominance of C1q
staining in the glomerulus and mesangial electron-dense deposits.14
It is predominant in males and African Americans are commonly
affected.
Proteinuria is usually in the nephrotic range and hematuria is present in
349

∼20% of the patients.
The best treatment for this lesion is unclear but should include
antiproteinuric strategies, such as ACE inhibitors.

MINIMAL CHANGE DISEASE
Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic
syndrome in children (∼65%) and in up to 10% to 15% of cases in
adults. The peak incidence of MCD is in children aged 2 to 7 years, but
the disease may occur at any age.
Clinical Presentation
The typical presentation of MCD is nephrotic syndrome. Clinical
presentation is usually characterized by rapid onset of edema, often with
periorbital edema, marked weight gain, pleural effusions, and ascites.
Children presenting with typical features of nephrotic syndrome usually
undergo empiric steroid therapy without a definitive diagnosis by
renal
biopsy. Steroid responsiveness in this group is equated with a diagnosis of
MCD.
Acute kidney injury can occur in up to 18% of adults. Major risk
factors for this presentation are male, older and hypertensive with lower
serum albumin and more proteinuria.15
Other complications of MCD include sepsis, peritonitis in ascitic fluid,
and thromboembolism.
The pathogenesis remains unknown but may be related to a disorder of
T-lymphocytes. There is a postulated circulating factor acting on
podocytes. The majority of cases are idiopathic.
Secondary Causes of MCD
Drugs can cause MCD, with the most common culprit being nonsteroidal
350

anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or interferon-α.
Hematologic malignancies, most notably Hodgkin disease, can present
with MCD and this should be kept in mind in the older age group.
However, it is not recommended to screen these patients extensively for
malignancy.
Heavy metals (mercury, lead) are rare causes of MCD.
Systemic allergic reactions to environmental allergens or vaccines may
rarely trigger MCD.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory Evaluation
Hypoalbuminemia and elevated cholesterol are frequently noted.
In children, the urine sediment may show Maltese-cross oval fat
bodies under polarized light.
In adults, microscopic hematuria is present in >30% of the cases.
Complement levels and other serologic markers are normal.
A urine protein electrophoresis will show that the negatively charged
protein albumin predominates. This has been termed selective
proteinuria.
Renal biopsy is required for diagnosis in children unresponsive to
steroids and in all adults presenting with nephrotic syndrome.
Pathology
Light microscopy is typically normal, although mild mesangial
hypercellularity may be found. Tubular and interstitial structures are
normal.
Immunofluorescence may reveal IgM and C3 trapped in damaged
351

capillary loops and mesangium. Heavy mesangial deposits of IgM are
associated
with worse prognosis and poor response to treatment (so-called IgM
nephropathy).
Electron microscopy reveals diffuse podocyte foot process fusion, but
this is a nonspecific finding.
Treatment
The initial treatment of adults with MCD is corticosteroids.
Typical regimens are daily dosing with prednisone 1 mg/kg (to
maximum of 80 mg/d) or alternate-day dosing with 2 mg/kg every other
day. These approaches appear to have similar initial response rates.
Treat for not less than 12 to 16 weeks at first presentation. Almost all
children respond rapidly by 8 weeks; however, adults may take longer,
with 75% to 80% achieving remission by 12 to 16 weeks of therapy.
Adults who initially respond to corticosteroids will experience at least
one relapse around 70% of the time. Relapses are usually treated with a
second course of corticosteroids.
In children, nephrotic syndrome is often treated with empiric
treatment.
As in adults, the mainstay of therapy is corticosteroids (prednisone, 1
mg/kg of ideal body weight per day, not to exceed 80 mg/d).
This regimen is usually continued for 4 weeks after resolution of
proteinuria and then tapered by 10 mg on an alternate-day regimen
every 2 weeks (total course of 3–4 months in steroid responders).
The typical course is remitting and relapsing, with ∼75% of patients
who initially achieve remission on steroids relapsing within 5 years.
Shorter courses of prednisone (6 to 10 weeks) can generally be used to
treat relapses.
352

Frequent relapsing (four or more relapses within 1 year),
steroid-​dependent (relapse upon tapering steroid therapy or within 2
weeks of discontinuing steroids and need for long-term maintenance
steroids), or steroid-resistant (failure to reach remission within 4
months of steroid treatment) patients should be treated with second-line
agents. Options for management include:
Oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg of ideal body weight per day) for 8
to 12 weeks with tapering dose of prednisone. Although there are no
satisfactory studies comparing 8- and 12-week courses in adults, a 12week course may be logical by extension of the pediatric experience.16
For patients who relapse after cyclophosphamide treatment,
cyclosporine
(4 to 5 mg/kg/d, target trough levels of 125 to 175 ng/mL) or tacrolimus
(target trough levels of 5 to 7 ng/mL) is also effective.
MMF has been used as an effective alternative therapy in small case
series.
Steroid-resistant patients are most susceptible to complications of steroid
therapy (osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, abnormal fat deposition).
A small percentage of adults initially thought to have MCD will progress
to ESRD. Repeat histology will typically reveal FSGS in these patients.

MCD VARIANT: IgM NEPHROPATHY
The term IgM nephropathy is used by some to describe patients
presenting with nephrotic syndrome and with the findings of mesangial
deposits of IgM, often with a minor degree of mesangial hypercellularity
on renal biopsy.
Controversy exists regarding whether to include this constellation of
findings as a variant of minimal disease or FSGS or as part of a
continuum related to both entities.
Patients are more likely to have microscopic hematuria and are less
353

likely to respond to corticosteroids. In one series, 23% progressed to
ESRD over 15-year follow-up.

MEMBRANOUS NEPHROPATHY
Epidemiology
Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic
syndrome due to primary glomerular disease in adults with an incidence
that roughly equals that of FSGS (∼35%).
It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in white adults aged
>60 years, and has a male predominance (∼2 to 3:1).
It is distinctly uncommon in children and adolescents.
Most cases (two-thirds) are idiopathic.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of MN is still not completely known. It is thought to be
due to autoimmunity via specific nephritogenic autoantibodies.
Heymann nephritis is a rat model of MN that is induced by inoculation
with megalin, a large (516-kDa) glycoprotein extracted from rat cortical
nephrons. Formation of antigen–antibody complexes are seen at the
podocyte level, with complement activation and formation of the
membrane attack complex (​C5b–9).
This leads to destruction of the glomerular base membrane (GBM) and
shedding of the immune complexes to form the characteristic
subepithelial deposits.17
Recently, experimental studies have advanced the understanding of the
pathogenesis of human membranous glomerulonephritis.
Identification of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) as the target antigen on
the glomerular podocyte in alloimmune MN resulting from fetomaternal
immunization in NEP-deficient mothers.18
354

A recent study demonstrated the presence of circulating antibodies to the
M-type phospholipase A2 receptor, a transmembrane protein located on
podocytes.19
Clinical Presentation
MN presents as nephrotic syndrome in 80% of patients.
Microscopic hematuria may be found in 50% of cases, but red blood
cell casts are unusual.
As with the other causes of nephrotic syndrome, a renal biopsy is
necessary to make the diagnosis.
Plasma complement levels are normal in the idiopathic form. Decreased
C3 or C4 should prompt further evaluation for systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) or other systemic disorders associated with
hypocomplementemia.
There is an increased incidence of thromboembolism, especially renal
vein thrombosis. Thromboembolism has been reported in up to 30% of
patients with MN.
MN is characterized by slow progression of renal insufficiency (<20%
of patients have renal insufficiency at time of presentation).
Hypertension develops only with advancing renal insufficiency and is
usually not characteristic of MN at earlier stages.
Secondary Causes of MN
A diagnosis of MN should prompt a thorough evaluation for other related
diseases. It is associated with a variety of autoimmune, infectious, and
malignant diseases, as well as with toxic or drug exposures.
Autoimmune diseases associated with MN include SLE (WHO class V),
type 1
diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease,
Sjögren’s syndrome, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and myasthenia gravis.
355

Associated infectious diseases are hepatitis B, hepatitis C (HCV),
syphilis, malaria, and schistosomiasis.
The most common associated cancers are those of the lung, breast,
kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, but cases of MN have been reported
with most forms of cancer. Nephrotic syndrome may precede clinical
evidence of malignancy by 12 to 18 months.20
Drugs such as NSAIDs, gold, penicillamine, hydrocarbons, mercury,
formaldehyde, and captopril have been reported in association with MN.
Diagnostic Testing
Pathology
Light microscopy:
Normal at early stages and later progresses to thickened glomerular
capillary wall with epithelial “spikes” seen by methenamine silver
staining.
Absence of leukocyte infiltration with no evidence of hypercellularity or
proliferative lesions. The presence of significant mesangial
hypercellularity suggests immune deposit formation in the mesangium
and is more consistent with a secondary MN such as class V lupus
nephritis.
Immunofluorescence:
Characteristic IgG granular subepithelial staining in all portions of the
glomerular capillary loop. In idiopathic MN, staining is exclusively IgG.
The predominant IgG subclass in idiopathic MN is IgG4. Presence of IgM
or IgA staining, particularly in the mesangium, as well as tubuloreticular
structures seen by electron microscopy suggests class V lupus nephritis.
Complement C3 and light chains are also present with similar
localization to IgG in ∼50% of cases.
Electron microscopy demonstrates the diagnostic subepithelial
356

electron-dense deposits in stages:
Stage I: subepithelial dense deposits without adjacent projections of
GBM; normal light microscopy.
Stage II: adjacent GBM projections forming spikes around immune
deposits.
Stage III: GBM projections surrounding deposits completely.
Stage IV: markedly thickened GBM with electron-lucent zones replacing
the dense deposits.
These stages re ect the severity and duration of disease but do not
correlate well with prognosis. The nding of extensive mesangial
electron-dense deposits should prompt consideration of MN
secondary to lupus.
Treatment
All patients with MN should be managed with blood pressure control
(goal, <130/80 mm Hg), dietary sodium restriction, ACE inhibition
or angiotensin receptor blockade, and lipid-lowering therapy.
Patients with documented renal vein or other venous thrombosis should
be anticoagulated with warfarin.
At present, there is no consensus for anticoagulation for primary
prevention, although patients with hypoalbuminemia of <2.0 g/dL are
considered to be at high risk for thrombosis and may be considered for
anticoagulation as primary prevention.
Once anticoagulation is started for a thrombotic event, the patient
should remain on therapy until nephrotic syndrome has resolved and
should be restarted if there is recurrence.
Aggressive cytotoxic therapy is reserved for patients considered to
be at higher risk for kidney disease progression, as the natural
history can be relatively benign in up to one-half of affected patients.
357

The higher risk group has decreased kidney function and/or has
proteinuria in excess of 8 g/d for >6 months despite maximal therapy to
reduce proteinuria.21
Ponticelli protocol for the treatment of MN (10-year follow-up study by
Italian group)22:
Months 1, 3, and 5: Methylprednisolone, 1 g given intravenously for
3 days, followed by prednisone, 0.5 mg per kg of ideal body weight PO
daily for the remainder of the 4 weeks.
Months 2, 4, and 6: Chlorambucil, 0.2 mg per kg of ideal body weight
PO daily for 4 weeks.
At 10-year follow-up, 88% of patients treated with this protocol had
partial or complete remission compared with 47% of controls.23 The
original study reported using chlorambucil (0.2 mg/kg). However, these
doses are limited by bone marrow toxicity of chlorambucil and lower
doses may be a more prudent course.
In the United States, more popular protocol has been
cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Cyclophosphamide, 1.5 to 2
mg/kg of ideal body weight per day PO daily, plus prednisone, 0.5
mg/kg of ideal body weight per day PO daily, can be given for 3 to 6
months. This regimen has been found to be comparable to the original
Ponticelli protocol in smaller studies.24
In both regimens, white blood cell (WBC) counts should be carefully
monitored. Typically, the WBCs are monitored weekly with both
chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide use.
Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections such as
cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster virus, Pneumocystis jiroveci should be
considered in the setting of immunosuppressive medications.
Alternative regimens include:
Cyclosporine, 3.5 to 5 mg/kg of ideal body weight per day (trough
358

levels of 125 to 225 mg/L) in two divided doses with low-dose
prednisone, which usually requires a more prolonged course (1 to 2
years) to sustain remission.
MMF plus steroids had shown some promise in small case series, but a
recent controlled trial did not show any significant benefit over
conservative management with blood pressure control, use of ACE
inhibitors and statins. It is not recommended in the treatment of MN.
Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, has been used with
success in resistant MN.
Outcomes/Prognosis
Factors associated with poor prognosis include male gender, age >50
years, presence of hypertension, decreased glomerular filtration rate
(plasma creatinine >1.2 mg/dL in women, >1.4 mg/dL in men),
nephrotic syndrome of >6-month duration, focal sclerosis, and >20%
interstitial fibrosis on renal biopsy specimen.
Spontaneous, partial, or complete remission is seen in up to 50% of
patients with MN within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis.
Up to one-fourth of patients who remit may experience a relapse of
nephrotic range proteinuria that may require disease-specific therapy.

MEMBRANOPROLIFERATIVE
GLOMERULONEPHRITIS
MPGN is a pathologic diagnosis based on the nding of di use mesangial
proliferation, thickening of the capillary wall, subendothelial immune
deposits, and hypercellularity. Most cases are associated with circulating
immune complexes and hypocomplementemia.
Classification
Type I MPGN

359

Pathology:
Type I MPGN is defined by subendothelial and mesangial immune
deposits seen on electron microscopy at renal biopsy.
Light microscopy reveals expanded mesangium with increased matrix
and cellularity, with a classic lobular appearance to the glomeruli. Using
the methenamine silver stain, a double contouring of the GBM can often
be appreciated (“tram tracks”).
Immunofluorescence usually shows discrete, granular staining of the
peripheral capillary wall for IgG and C3.
Type I MPGN is frequently idiopathic but is also often associated with
cryoglobulinemia, chronic HCV infection, chronic hepatitis B viral
infection, endocarditis, or malarial infection.
Cryoglobulinemic MPGN may histologically appear similar to MPGN
type 1. However, intracapillary hyaline-like deposits (cryoprecipitates)
can be found by light microscopy occasionally. Electron microscopy may
also show the highly organized tubular or finely fibrillar structures
consistent with cryoglobulins.
Pathogenesis:
Type I MPGN is most likely associated with chronic immune-complex
diseases.
The pathogenesis includes glomerular deposition of immune complexes
that preferentially localize to the mesangium and subendothelial space,
with subsequent complement activation via classic pathway with
resultant inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, and cellular proliferation.
Type I MPGN can also be associated with hereditary complement
deficiencies (C1q, C2, C4, or C3) or with impaired reticuloendothelial
system, as occurs with liver or splenic disease.
C3, C4, and CH50 are reduced in most cases.
360

Type II MPGN (Dense Deposit Disease)
Pathology:
Type II MPGN is defined by the presence of electron-dense deposits
within the mesangium and the GBM on electron microscopy.
The immunofluorescence staining is positive for C3 but is negative for
both classic complement pathway components and for immunoglobulins.
Pathogenesis:
Type II MPGN is associated with C3 nephritic factor (a circulating
autoantibody that binds to C3 convertase and prevents its inactivation by
factor H) or the dysfunction of a constitutive inhibitor factor H, which
leads to constitutive activation of the alternate pathway of
complement and damage to the GBM.
The condition is associated with partial lipodystrophy in up to 25% of
pediatric patients, leading to marked reduction in subcutaneous fat
tissues, especially in the face and upper body.
C3 and CH50 are reduced in most cases; C4 is usually normal.
Type III MPGN
Pathology:
Type III MPGN is defined by diffuse subendothelial deposits and
electron-dense deposits within the GBM and in the subepithelial
spaces.
The immunofluorescence pattern of MPGN type III is similar to MPGN
type I.
Pathogenesis:
Type III MPGN includes activation of the classic or terminal pathway of
complement activation.
361

The nephritic factor of the terminal pathway may be present in this
form. It activates terminal components and requires properdin.
C3 and the terminal complement components (C5 through C9) are
reduced, and C5b to C9 membrane attack complex levels are elevated.
Clinical Presentation of MPGN
Clinical presentation of patients with MPGN types 1 and 2 can range
from nephrotic syndrome and microscopic or gross hematuria to
acute nephritic syndrome with rapid decline of kidney function.
MPGN type I is frequently associated with cryoglobulinemia and HCV
infection in older adults (aged >30 years). MPGN type II is most often
seen in children.
Hypertension is present in a majority of cases.
Diagnosis of MPGN should prompt investigation for underlying causes,
including blood cultures to rule out infective endocarditis; serologies for
hepatitis B, HCV, and HIV; evaluation for malignancy; chronic liver
disease; or SLE.
Laboratory Findings
Type I and cryoglobulinemic MPGN: low C3, low C4, low CH50
Type II: low C3, normal C4, low CH50, C3 nephritic factor present in

∼60% of cases

Type III: low C3, low C5 to C9
Cryoglobulinemia:
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold.
Type 1 cryoglobulinemia is a monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA,
or IgM), associated with lymphoproliferative disease (multiple myeloma,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia).
362

Type II (mixed essential cryoglobulinemia) is monoclonal IgM,
usually IgM-κ, with polyclonal IgG. This monoclonal IgM autoantibody is
a rheumatic factor, that is, directed against the Fc portion of other
immunoglobulins.
Type III is polyclonal IgM directed against polyclonal IgG.
Types II and III are most commonly associated with MPGN. They have
also been strongly related to chronic HCV infection.
Systemic cryoglobulinemia, in patients who usually have chronic HCV
infection, may present with the triad of weakness, arthralgias, and
painless, palpable, nonpruritic purpura. The vasculitic lesions
classically involve the lower extremities and buttocks. Other
manifestations may include Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital necrosis,
peripheral neuropathy, and hepatomegaly.
Treatment
Always exclude causes of secondary MPGN before planning treatment.
General measures to reduce proteinuria, control blood pressure, and treat
dyslipidemia are indicated for all types.
For patients with normal renal function and asymptomatic
nonnephrotic range proteinuria, no specific therapy is necessary.
Close follow-up every 3 to 4 months is recommended.25
In patients with nephrotic syndrome or progressive renal failure,
corticosteroids (tapering prednisone started at 1 mg/kg/d) with or
without cytotoxic agents for 3 to 6 months may be prescribed.
Treatment with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or MMF can be considered if
there is no response to steroids within 3 months.
Other therapies:
Antiplatelet therapies, such as aspirin or dipyridamole, have been
studied in several trials. Although proteinuria was reduced in the
363

treatment group, no differences in renal function were observed.
Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin has also been studied in the
MPGN population and is of unclear benefit with substantial bleeding
risks.
HCV-associated cryoglobulinemia has been successfully treated with
pegylated interferon-α plus ribavirin in the setting of stable renal
function. If renal function is rapidly deteriorating (commonly termed
fulminant cryoglobulinemia), high-dose steroid therapy is indicated,
with or without cytotoxic therapy and plasma exchange.26
Natural History
Untreated MPGN progresses to death or ESRD in 50% of adults within 5
years and up to 90% in 20 years.
The factors associated with outcome include: the severity of crescents
(regardless of pathologic type), the tubulointerstitial lesions, and
interstitial fibrosis.
The disease can recur after renal transplantation, especially types II and
III and MPGN associated with HCV.

IgA NEPHROPATHY AND HENOCH–SCHöNLEIN
PURPURA
Epidemiology
IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger’s disease) is the most common
form of glomerular disease diagnosed worldwide.
The incidence in the United States and Canada is substantially lower
than that in Europe and Asia. This discrepancy may be due to rates of
routine urinalysis in the United States compared with Asian countries and
due to attitudes toward doing kidney biopsies in patients with
asymptomatic hematuria.
364

In populations of Caucasian descent, the male-to-female ratio is 3:1,
whereas the ratio approaches 1:1 in most Asian populations.
Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a syndrome associated with IgA
deposition in the kidney with other systemic features. This disorder is
seen predominantly in children and adolescents.
Clinical Presentation
Microscopic or gross hematuria is almost always part of the initial
presentation of IgA nephropathy.
Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria with variable degrees of
proteinuria is found in 30% to 40% of cases.
Acute macroscopic hematuria concurrent with upper respiratory tract
infection is seen in roughly 50% of patients. The timing of the hematuria
after the infection is usually within 1 to 2 days. This is in contrast to
poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, in which the hematuria (often
associated with nephritic syndrome) occurs 10 to 14 days after
pharyngitis.
Occasionally, patients will present with nephrotic syndrome, acute
kidney injury, or rapid progressive course with glomerular epithelial
crescents on biopsy (<5%).
Progressive renal insufficiency and hypertension are seen in a minority
of patients.
Laboratory evaluation demonstrates normal complement levels and
increased plasma IgA levels in approximately one-third of patients.
Diagnosis is made by renal biopsy.
Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a syndrome with IgA nephropathy
associated with systemic vasculitis caused by IgA deposition. It is usually
seen in children and adolescents and presents with arthralgias, purpuric
skin rash (buttocks, abdomen, lower extremities), abdominal pain, ileus,
or gastrointestinal bleeding. Renal involvement may be transient.
365

Secondary Causes of IgA Nephropathy
IgA deposition associated with mesangial cell proliferation can appear
secondary to systemic diseases associated with decreased IgA clearance
or increased IgA production.27
Celiac sprue
Inflammatory bowel disease
Ankylosing spondylitis
Dermatitis herpetiformis
IgA monoclonal gammopathy
HIV
Diagnostic Testing
Pathology
Light microscopy reveals global or segmental mesangial
hypercellularity with normal-appearing peripheral GBMs.
Immunofluorescence demonstrates mesangial IgA deposition,
codeposition of C3, and, less commonly, IgG and IgM codeposition.
Electron microscopy shows mesangial electron-dense deposits and focal
thinning of GBM in up to one-third of patients.
Treatment
Little controversy exists in the general management of patients with IgA
nephropathy.
Blood pressure control with ACE inhibitor or ARB is indicated in all
hypertensive patients with IgA nephropathy and may be of some benefit
despite normal blood pressure at presentation.
366

If proteinuria is <1 g/d, no specific treatment is indicated.
The treatment of IgA nephropathy with proteinuria >1 g/d remains
controversial.
The effect of fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids has been studied
by several groups. One group found that the patients receiving fish oil
(12 g daily) had a significantly lower rate of progression of renal
insufficiency and lower rate of progression to ESRD compared with
placebo.28 Other studies have shown no benefit. It remains unclear if
certain subgroups would benefit from this therapy.
Immunosuppressive therapy:
If proteinuria is still >1 g/d on maximal supportive therapy and renal
function is not stabilized, consider a trial of steroids for 6 months.
In IgA nephropathy, when MCD with nephrotic syndrome coincides, a
trial of high-dose corticosteroid therapy is justified.
If there is crescentic IgA nephropathy, treat aggressively to save renal
function: prednisone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/d plus cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg/d
for 8 to 12 weeks of induction, followed by tapering prednisone and
azathioprine for maintenance. Treatment has often combined plasma
exchange with steroids and cyclophosphamide.
In sum, the use of immunosuppressive regimens needs to be tailored to
the severity (and thus prognosis) of disease.
Mesangial IgA deposition occurs in up to 60% of patients receiving a
renal transplant for ESRD secondary to primary IgA nephropathy, but the
majority of recurrences do not worsen graft outcome and have a benign
course.
Natural History
The majority of patients with IgA nephropathy do not progress to ESRD
and experience a benign disease course.
367

Several markers predicting a better outcome are minimal proteinuria,
normal blood pressure, and normal renal function on presentation. In
addition, lack of fibrosis of glomeruli and tubulointerstitium are good
prognostic signs.
Approximately 30% of patients with IgA nephropathy will experience
progressive disease. These patients often have poor prognostic features
including poorly controlled hypertension, older age at diagnosis,
persistent proteinuria >1 g/d, reduced renal function at diagnosis, and
tubulointerstitial fibrosis or more advanced glomerular lesions on renal
biopsy.27

RENAL DISEASE IN SYSTEMIC LUPUS
ERYTHEMATOSUS
General Principles
Renal disease is a common manifestation of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and may be associated with substantial morbidity
and mortality.
Renal involvement is extremely diverse, ranging from asymptomatic
urinary findings to fulminant renal failure or florid nephrotic syndrome.
Renal manifestations may be the initial presentation of SLE or may
emerge later in the disease course.
Epidemiology
The incidence and prevalence of SLE vary with age (more common in
those aged <55 years),1 gender (female >> male), and ethnicity
(African-American and Hispanics > Caucasians).2
Men, non-European Americans, and patients younger than <33 years of
age are more likely to develop nephritis.3
Of the unselected patients with SLE, ∼25% to 50% will have clinical
evidence of lupus nephritis (LN) at disease onset, whereas up to 60% of
adults and 80% of children may develop renal disease later in their
course.4

DIAGNOSIS
372

Clinical Presentation
LN is usually accompanied by extrarenal manifestations of lupus, but in
some patients this might be the initial presentation of SLE.
Proteinuria is present in virtually every patient with renal involvement.
Nephrotic syndrome is present in 45% to 65% of patients with
proteinuria.4
Microscopic hematuria is very common; macroscopic hematuria is rare.
Red blood cell (RBC) casts, white blood cell (WBC) casts, and granular
casts can all be seen.
Renal insufficiency may be rapidly progressive.
Renal tubular dysfunction (type I and IV renal tubular acidosis) is also
seen, and is associated with hypokalemia or hyperkalemia.
Hypertension can be present, especially in those with severe nephritis.
Clinical findings do not necessarily correlate with histologic findings on
biopsy.

Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnosis of SLE can usually be made based on the 1982 revised criteria
373

of the American College of Rheumatology (Table 18-1).5 The presence
of ≥4 criteria gives a sensitivity and specificity of 96% for SLE. The
criteria were subsequently revised in 1997 with addition of “positive
finding of antiphospholipid antibodies.”6
Hypocomplementemia is found in >70% of untreated patients with
SLE, and is more common in active nephritis.4 C4 tends to be more
depressed than C3.
Although a presumptive diagnosis of LN can be made in SLE patients
with proteinuria, hematuria, cellular casts, and/or renal insufficiency,
renal biopsy is absolutely necessary for diagnostic confirmation,
therapy guidance, and prognostic information, as prognosis and
treatment options depend on the histologic subtype. Also, recurrence of
LN, even after years of remission, occurs in 50% of patients.
Transformation from one class of LN to another can occur at any time in
the disease course, spontaneously or during therapy. Commonly, class III
progresses to class IV nephritis, and class IV nephritis transitions into
class V nephritis.
Renal biopsy is usually recommended in all patients with SLE who have
proteinuria, hematuria, active urinary sediment, and/or reduced renal
function.
Diagnostic Testing
Renal Pathology
LN can affect all parts of the kidney–-glomerulus, microvasculature,
interstitium, and the tubules.
The 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society
(ISN/RPS) classification of LN is based on the degree of glomerular
involvement (Table 18-2).8
On immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy, IgG is the predominant
immunoglobulin (especially IgG1 and IgG3). Complements are usually
present. The presence of all three isotypes of immunoglobulin, C3, C4,
374

and C1q, is called a “full house” and is highly suggestive of LN.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) involving intrarenal vessels and
glomeruli may be associated with the presence of antiphospholipid
antibodies.

TREATMENT
Significant advances have been made over the last few decades in the
treatment of LN, with improvement in both patient and renal survival.
However, adverse effects of treatment remain a significant contributor to
morbidity and mortality.
The goal of treatment is to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize
therapy-related complications.
In all classes of LN, blockade of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
system and treatment of dyslipidemia should be implemented. Blood
pressure should be well controlled, with goal of <130/80 mm Hg.
Females should be counseled on appropriate contraception during
therapy, as pregnancy during flares can have adverse maternal and fetal
outcomes due to the disease itself, as well due to the teratogenic effects of
some medications. Given potential for gonadal toxicity from treatment
regimens, fertility preservation should be discussed prior to initiation.
We also recommend pneumococcal vaccination for all patients with
SLE, especially prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy.
Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) should be
considered prior to initiation of therapy.
375

Classes I and II
Patients with mesangial LN have an excellent renal prognosis and do
not require specific treatment directed at the kidney. Conservative
management should include optimal blood pressure control and blockade
of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.
One should be aware that transformation into a different class can occur
at any time.
Classes III and IV
The therapy for Class III LN remains controversial. The treatment is
generally based on percentage of involved glomeruli, severity of renal
histology findings, and clinical manifestations such as the severity of
proteinuria, hypertension, and renal dysfunction. In milder cases of Class
III LN, glucocorticoids alone might be sufficient, but patients have to be
closely monitored. If the clinical manifestations deteriorate, then
additional immunosuppressive therapy should be considered.
Patients with more severe form of focal proliferative and Class IV
diffuse proliferative LN require aggressive treatment, as these patients
are at high risk for progressive renal failure. Treatment regimens are
generally divided into induction and maintenance phases.
Induction therapy: The goal of induction therapy is to achieve
complete remission. The definition of complete remission is
controversial, but includes reduction or stabilization of serum creatinine
(SCr), reduction in proteinuria (at least <500 mg per 24 hour), and
reduction in microscopic hematuria to less than five RBCs per high power
field. Induction therapy usually consists of corticosteroids (pulse
methylprednisolone 500 to 1000 mg intravenously (IV) daily for 3 days
followed by prednisone 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg PO daily, with tapering
beginning at 8 weeks) and other immunosuppressive agents listed below.
Cyclophosphamide: Both oral and IV forms have been used for
induction. The IV route involves a lower cumulative dose and is
associated with less complications and better compliance. The following
376

regimens have been used:
Monthly IV cyclophosphamide 0.5 to 1 gm/m2 for 6 months, followed by
maintenance therapy10,11 (see below).
Fixed dose of cyclophosphamide (500 mg) IV every 2 weeks, for a total
of 6 doses,12 followed by maintenance therapy. This regimen should be
used for Caucasians with less severe renal disease.
Others have used oral cyclophosphamide (1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/d PO) for 3
to 6 months, followed by maintenance therapy.
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 2 to 3 gm PO per day for 6 months
followed by maintenance therapy) has been shown to be equally
efficacious as, or better than, cyclophosphamide as induction
therapy.13–15
Maintenance therapy: After achieving remission, maintenance therapy
with MMF (1 to 2 g/d PO) or azathioprine (2 mg/kg PO daily) with lowdose prednisone is generally continued for at least 24 months with a
subsequent slow taper. This maintenance approach appears to be safer
and perhaps more effective than using maintenance IV
cyclophosphamide.
In patients unresponsive to standard therapies, less well-studied
treatments such as rituximab and IV immunoglobulin are administered to
achieve induction.
The addition of plasmapheresis to cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid
regimen did not improve outcome in one randomized controlled trial and
is generally not recommended.
Class V
There is no well-defined treatment strategy for those with subnephrotic
proteinuria.
In patients with nephrotic range proteinuria, MMF, cyclosporine, and
377

cyclophosphamide have all shown efficacy.11,16 Cyclosporine may be
associated with higher rates of relapse.
Patients with concurrent proliferative features have a worse long-term
renal outcome and may do better with combination therapy with MMF
and tacrolimus as induction therapy.17

Pauci-Immune Glomerulonephritis: Wegener’s
Granulomatosis, Churg–Strauss Syndrome, and
Microscopic Polyangiitis
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (GN) is characterized by necrotizing
crescentic GN with minimal or no immune complex deposits in vessel
walls.
Pauci-immune GN share the common feature of a spectrum of systemic
necrotizing small vessel vasculitides that includes Wegener’s
granulomatosis (WG), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), renal-limited
vasculitis, and less frequently Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS).
These disorders are associated with the presence of circulating
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in 80% to 90% of the
cases.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Pauci-immune small vessel vasculitides are the most common cause of
rapidly progressive GN (RPGN) in adults.
They may occur at any age, but are more frequent in older adults aged
>50 years.
There is no gender difference, and the incidence is higher in Caucasians
than African-Americans.

378

The disease is only limited to the kidney in about one-third of cases.1

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of WG, MPA, and CSS can be quite diverse. The
extent of systemic organ involvement may differ. Generalized,
nonspecific signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation are common
(malaise, anorexia, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and so forth).
WG is characterized by necrotizing, granulomatous inflammation that
typically involves the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys,
although almost any other organ can be involved.
CSS, like WG, is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous
inflammation. In addition, patients with CSS have asthma and peripheral
blood eosinophilia.
MPA is generally a diagnosis of exclusion in the presence of pauciimmune GN and systemic vasculitis, and the absence of granulomas,
eosinophilia, and asthma.
Renal involvement can develop in 80% of patients with WG, 90% of
patients with MPA, and 45% patient’s with CSS.18 Patients typically
present with a nephritic urine sediment, variable degrees of proteinuria,
hypertension, and often a rapid decline in renal function. Some patients,
however, follow a more subacute renal course.
Diagnostic Testing
The diagnosis of small-vessel vasculitides should be made promptly so
that appropriate therapy can be initiated. Clinical presentation and
urinalysis are often suggestive.
ANCA is a useful diagnostic marker and should be obtained if there is
pre-test suspicion for ANCA-associated GN.
Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IIF) should be performed as
379

a screening test cytoplasmic or C-ANCA vs. perinuclear or P-ANCA,
followed by ELISA, which identifies the specific autoantigen
(myeloperoxidase [MPO] vs. proteinase 3 [PR3]).
The sensitivity and specificity of combined testing (IIF + ELISA) is 72.5%
and 98.4%, respectively.19 The positive and negative predicative values
of ANCA testing are determined not only by the sensitivity and specificity
of ANCA but also by the prevalence of the disease in a given population.
The prevalence of pauci-immune GN varies greatly with the clinical
presentations of patients, most frequent in those with clinical evidence of
severe glomerular disease.20
A negative ANCA test does not exclude the diagnosis, as 10% to 20%
of patients with pauci-immune vasculitis do not test positive for ANCA.
cANCA most often has specificity for PR3, and pANCA most often has
specificity for MPO. WG is associated with PR3-ANCA, whereas MPA,
CSS, and renal-limited vasculitis are primarily associated with
MPO-ANCA.
Renal biopsy is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis of pauci-immune
GN, given the potential toxicity associated with treatment, unless there is
an absolute contraindication to undergoing a biopsy.
Renal Pathology
Segmental fibrinoid necrosis, crescent formation, and a lack of
immunoglobulin staining by IF or electron microscopy (EM) are the main
features. Granulomatous inflammation is rarely seen in the kidney.

TREATMENT
Induction therapy:
Combination therapy with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids.
Cyclophosphamide at 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg/d PO, or 15 mg/kg IV at monthly
intervals (adjusted for renal function and age) can be given.
380

PO and IV form have similar efficacy but total drug exposure is less in
the IV form, which may translate into less toxicity.21 There is a trend
toward higher relapses in the IV-treated patients.
Cyclophosphamide should be continued until clinical remission (usually 3
to 6 months) before switching to maintenance therapy.
Prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d (pulse methylprednisolone 250 to 1000 mg IV
daily for 3 days prior to starting prednisone can be given in severe
disease). Prednisone can be tapered at 4 weeks if clinical improvement is
observed, with the goal of discontinuing corticosteroids by 6 to 9 months
(if there are no extrarenal manifestations).
For patients who are unable to take cyclophosphamide, rituximab is an
effective alternative therapy.22,23
Plasmapheresis (1 to 1.5 plasma volume exchanges for 5 to 7 days)
should be considered in patients with life-threatening disease who are
dialysis-dependent at presentation, have pulmonary hemorrhage, or
manifest concomitant anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM)
antibodies.22
For those patients who are dialysis-dependent, but there are no signs of
renal recovery after 2 to 3 months of induction therapy, continued
immunosuppressive therapy should be dictated by extrarenal
involvement.
Maintenance therapy:
Azathioprine (2 mg/kg PO daily) and methotrexate (20 to 25 mg/wk
maximum, along with folic acid) are equally efficacious in preventing
relapses.
MMF is less effective than azathioprine for maintaining disease
remission.23
Corticosteroids play very little role in maintenance therapy and should
be used only for extrarenal manifestations.
381

The optimal duration of maintenance therapy is unknown. Most
recommend 12 to 18 months to reduce the risk of relapse.

PROGNOSIS
Without treatment, 1-year mortality is ∼80%. With aggressive
immunosuppressive therapy, 5-year survival is ∼65% to 75%.24 Older
age, dialysis dependence, and presence of pulmonary hemorrhage are all
risk factors for poor outcome. The presence of irreversible, dialysisdependent renal failure reduces the 5-year patient survival to 30% to
35%.24
The best predicator of renal outcome is the SCr at the time of
presentation and the extent of renal injury on biopsy. About 25% of
patients progress to end-stage renal disease.
About 40% of patients relapse after achieving remission. Patients with
PR3-ANCA have higher relapse rate and carry a worse prognosis.
Renal transplantation remains a good option in patients who have
quiescent disease for at least 6 months prior to transplant. The presence
of circulating ANCA without clinical disease activity is not a
contraindication to transplantation.

ANTI-GLOMERULAR BASEMENT MEMBRANE
ANTIBODY DISEASE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anti-GBM antibody disease is characterized by necrotizing crescentic GN
in association with circulating antibodies against the noncollagenous-1
domain of the α3-chain of type IV collagen.
Goodpasture’s disease refers to the triad of RPGN, pulmonary
hemorrhage, and presence of anti-GBM antibodies.
Epidemiology
382

Anti-GBM antibody disease is a very rare condition, accounting for 1% to
2% of all glomerular diseases.
The disease can occur at any age but usually peaks in the second to third
decade, with a smaller peak later in the sixth decade. There tends to be a
male predominance in the younger age group and female predominance
in elderly patients.
About 70% of patients have pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary
involvement is more common in young males, whereas older patients are
more likely to
have isolated RPGN. Those with pulmonary hemorrhage are usually
cigarette smokers.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Renal disease typically presents as RPGN with rapid decline in renal
function (over days to weeks), oliguria, and active urinary sediment.
Hypertension and edema can also be present. Occasionally, patients may
have a subacute course with slower decline in renal function.
Pulmonary disease presents with hemoptysis, cough, and dyspnea with
alveolar infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Up to 30% of patients with anti-GBM antibody disease have a
positive ANCA, typically MPO-ANCA, and may have other features of
systemic vasculitis such as fever, malaise, or weight loss.
In X-linked Alport syndrome, patients can develop de novo anti-GBM
antibody disease after renal transplantation, with the antibodies
targeting primarily against the α5-chain of type IV collagen.
Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnosis is suspected when one presents with the above-mentioned
clinical features, and confirmed by the presence of circulating anti-GBM
383

antibodies and findings on the renal biopsy specimen. Renal histology
will also provide prognostic information.
Diagnostic Testing
Renal Pathology
Light microscopy (LM) reveals focal and segmental proliferative GN,
with areas of fibrinoid necrosis and crescent formation.
IF reveals the classic pattern of linear IgG deposition along the GBM.
IgA, IgM, and C3 staining can occasionally be seen as well.

TREATMENT
Plasmapheresis is aimed at removal of circulating anti-GBM antibodies.
It is performed daily or on alternate days for 14 days, with monitoring of
clinical response and anti-GBM antibody titers (typically, 4 L exchanges
with 5% albumin as replacement solution, or fresh frozen plasma if
recent biopsy or pulmonary hemorrhage is present).25 Adverse effects of
plasma exchange, including hypocalcemia, coagulopathy, metabolic
alkalosis, and thrombocytopenia, must be closely monitored.
Cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/d PO for 3 months) and corticosteroids
(pulse methylprednisolone 500 to 1000 mg/d for 3 days, followed by
prednisone 1 mg/kg/d PO, with taper to 20 mg/d by 6 weeks and slow
taper to off by 6 months) are used to suppress production of anti-GBM
antibodies. Monitoring of anti-GBM antibody level can help determine
the duration of therapy.
Patients who do not have pulmonary disease and are dialysis dependent
at diagnosis, particularly those with crescents in all glomeruli, have a
very poor renal prognosis and may not benefit from aggressive
immunosuppression.

PROGNOSIS
Patients who are untreated have a fulminant course with mortality
384

rate of >90%, thus emphasizing the need for a high level of suspicion
for this disease to enable early diagnosis and treatment. With prompt
treatment, mortality decreases to <10%.1
In those who are dialysis dependent at the time of presentation, patient
and renal survival are only 65% and 8%, respectively, at 1 year with
appropriate treatment. Conversely, the 1-year renal survival rate in those
not requiring dialysis at presentation is 95% if creatinine was <5.7
mg/dL and 82% if creatinine was >5.7 mg/dL.26
Clinical relapses are uncommon.
The prognosis of patients with both positive ANCA and positive antiGBM antibody parallels that of the anti-GBM antibody disease (although
data are controversial).

POSTSTREPTOCOCCAL GN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Poststreptococcal GN (PSGN) is an immune–complex-mediated GN that is
caused by certain nephritogenic strains of group A streptococci. PSGN can
occur as sporadic cases or during a streptococcal epidemic. The nature of
the nephritogenic antigen and the mechanisms that lead to renal immune
complex deposition are not clearly understood.
Epidemiology
PSGN is primarily a disease of children and the peak incidence is in the
first decade (rare before the age of 3 years). However, PSGN has been
increasingly reported in older patients (especially those aged >60 years).
There is a male predominance.
The incidence of PSGN is on the decline in industrialized nations, but
remains high in the developing world.26
Prevention
385

The risk is minimized by early treatment of streptococcal infection with
antibiotics.
Family members and close contacts should receive prophylactic
antibiotics.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Typically, there is a sudden onset of hematuria (typically described as
tea or coca-cola colored), elevated SCr, hypertension, and edema
that occurs ∼1 to 3 weeks after pharyngitis or a skin infection (latency
period may be longer). Oliguria and, less commonly, anuria may occur.
Subclinical forms of PSGN manifested by microscopic hematuria may
occur and may be more common than overt nephritis.
There is usually a recent history of streptococcal throat infection or skin
infection.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Urine sediment usually reveals dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, granular
casts, and sometimes WBC casts.
Proteinuria is variable; nephrotic range is more common in adults.
Throat and skin cultures are infrequently positive.
Antistreptolysin-O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNAse
B) titers are frequently elevated, the latter being more specific for skin
infection. The streptozyme test, which measures antibodies to five
different antigens—ASO, anti-DNAse B, antihyaluronidase,
antistreptokinase, and anti-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)—is
more sensitive.
386

Serum complement levels, especially C3 and CH50, are almost always
depressed during an acute episode and generally normalize by 6 weeks
after diagnosis.
Diagnosis can generally be made based on the clinical history and
laboratory data. Renal biopsy should be performed if the diagnosis is in
question or if renal disease fails to improve spontaneously.
Renal Pathology
On LM, a diffuse endocapillary proliferative GN is seen. Neutrophils are
abundant. Monocytic infiltrate can be present. The presence of crescents
indicates a poor prognosis.
IF microscopy reveals granular staining of IgG and C3 along the
glomerular capillary walls and in the mesangium. IgA and IgM deposits
have also been reported.
On EM, large, dome-shaped subepithelial electron-dense deposits
(“subepithelial humps”) are characteristic; smaller mesangial and
subendothelial deposits are also seen.

TREATMENT
Treatment is generally supportive, including salt restriction, diuretics for
edema, and blood pressure control.
Antibiotics should be given if there is evidence of a persistent infection.
For those patients who do not improve spontaneously (especially those
with crescentic GN), pulse corticosteroids may be tried but the benefits
are not well established.

NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS
Resolution of acute symptoms occurs within a few weeks.
Microscopic hematuria may persist for up to 6 months, while mild
387

proteinuria can be seen for years.
In general, the prognosis of PSGN is excellent in children.
Adults are more likely to have persistent proteinuria (22%), renal
insufficiency (49%), and hypertension (30%) on long-term follow up.27
Nephrotic proteinuria and presence of extensive crescents on renal
biopsy predict a worse outcome. Progression to ESRD is uncommon.

THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHIES:
THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA–
HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
TMA describes the histologic lesions that are characteristic of several
clinically diverse disorders, with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) being the most common.
Other disorders, such as malignant hypertension, scleroderma, and the
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, will not be discussed here.
TMA is the result of pathologic processes that affect the systemic
microvasculature, leading to platelet aggregation and intraluminal
thrombi formation.
TTP and HUS are diseases of multiple etiologies associated with
potentially different pathogenic mechanisms. They are characterized by
the clinical syndrome of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia (MAHA), and variable degree of organ damage, with the kidney
and the central nervous system being the most affected.
Definition
The current diagnostic criteria for TTP include otherwise unexplained
thrombocytopenia and MAHA. The criteria are much less stringent
compared to the classic pentad of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, fever,
388

neurologic changes, and acute renal failure.28
It applies usually to adults.
Traditionally, neurologic symptoms dominate, although some patients
present with both neurological abnormalities and renal failure.
Most cases of TTP are acquired; a small proportion has hereditary
deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin-1like domains (ADAMTS-13).
HUS is defined by the same criteria as TTP plus the presence of renal
failure.
It applies usually to children.
Typical (diarrhea positive, D+): associated with Shiga toxin-producing
E. coli O157:H7 (90%).
Atypical (diarrhea negative, D–): associated with genetic mutations
leading to dysregulation of complement system (10%).
Given the overlapping features, some prefer to use the term TTP–HUS to
refer to the syndrome of thrombocytopenia and MAHA without a clear
etiology.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
TTP is often idiopathic but may be familial or related to pregnancy,
collagen vascular diseases such as SLE, malignancy, infections (HIV,
parvovirus), bone marrow transplantation, or medications. Oral
contraceptives, ticlopidine (and less commonly clopidogrel), mitomycin
C, gemcitabine, and multiple other chemotherapeutics, calcineurin
inhibitors, interferon-α, and quinine have all been associated with TTP.
The pathogenesis of TTP is linked to inherited or acquired deficiencies of
von Willebrand factor (vWF)-cleaving protease, which is normally
389

responsible for cleaving and clearing large vWF multimers that promote
platelet aggregation and microvascular thrombosis. An inhibitory
autoantibody to vWF-cleaving protease has been found in patients with
acquired TTP.
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
Classic childhood Shiga toxin-mediated HUS, or D+ HUS, is caused by
certain E. coli strains (usually O157:H7) and Shigella. Transmission is
from contaminated food (e.g., undercooked meat) or secondary personto-person ​contact. The Shiga toxin triggers the microangiopathic process
by entering the circulation via inflamed colonic tissue and causing
endothelial damage and platelet activation.
D- HUS is less well understood. Mutations in genes for complement
proteins (such as C3, membrane cofactor protein, and factors I, H, and
B) are seen in many cases. Excessive complement activation is thought to
induce endothelial injury.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
D+ HUS occurs most commonly in young children (aged <5 years) in
the summer and is preceded by an acute hemorrhagic diarrheal illness.
D+ HUS accounts for >90% of HUS.
Clinical features of HUS include sudden onset of oligoanuric renal
failure, pallor, and, in some cases, mental status changes (lethargy,
confusion, coma, seizures) preceded by 1 week of diarrheal illness.
Hypertension, purpuric rash, jaundice, and pancreatitis can be seen in
some patients.
Laboratory features include schistocytes on peripheral blood smear,
elevated lactate dehydrogenase, thrombocytopenia, elevated blood
urea nitrogen and SCr, and normal PT and PTT. Most patients have
390

microscopic hematuria on urinalysis and proteinuria of varying degree.
Evidence of E. coli O157:H7 infection may be present.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
TTP is not preceded by a diarrheal illness and is a disease generally
occurring in adults, disproportionately affecting African-American
women.
The classic pentad is not often seen in TTP. Renal involvement is less
common than HUS and may be less severe. The diagnosis of TTP is a
clinical one, and the measurement of ADAMTS-13 activity is not required.
Diagnostic Testing
Renal Pathology
Renal histology in TTP–HUS reveals TMA with fibrin and platelet
thrombi in glomerular capillaries, arterioles, and arteries. Arterioles and
arteries demonstrate endothelial swelling and intimal thickening, causing
luminal narrowing. Capillary wall double contours may be seen due to
widening of the subendothelial space. Ischemic glomeruli may have
wrinkled, partially collapsed capillaries. Acute cortical necrosis may
occur in severe cases of TTP–HUS.
IF demonstrates diffuse fibrinogen staining in capillary and arterial
walls.
On EM, swelling of glomerular endothelial cells and widened
subendothelial spaces are seen.

TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS
Classic D+ HUS
Treatment is supportive only and includes attention to fluid-electrolyte
imbalances, bowel rest, RBC transfusion, and renal replacement therapy
if needed.
391

The role of plasma exchange has not been adequately evaluated by
randomized, controlled studies. Some recommend a trial of plasma
exchange in severe cases.
Antibiotics and antimotility agents are not recommended. In fact,
there are several epidemiological and retrospective studies showing
increased incidence of HUS in patients treated with antibiotics and
antimotility agents for diarrheal illnesses.
Up to 90% have a partial recovery, although up to 40% may have
reduced GFR and residual proteinuria. Adults tend to do worse than
children.
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
With the exception of TTP related to chemotherapeutic agents and
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, plasma exchange is life
saving and should be initiated promptly, with consecutive daily
treatments until platelet count is normal.29 Twice-daily exchanges may be
required initially.
Patients with normal ADAMTS-13 activity who clinically have TTP
appear to benefit from plasma exchange as much as those with low
ADAMTS-13 activity.
For those with inadequate or no response to plasma exchange,
corticosteroids can be used as an adjunctive therapy.30 Other therapies
such as intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, rituximab, and
splenectomy have been used with variable efficacy.
The prognosis of TTP varies with the underlying etiology. Mortality has
decreased from 90% before availability of plasma exchange to 20% with
plasma exchange. Relapses are rare.

RENAL AMYLOIDOSIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
392

Amyloidosis refers to a group of diseases characterized by extracellular
deposition of insoluble fibrils, leading to organ dysfunction.
Amyloidosis is classified based on the type of precursor protein that
forms the amyloid fibrils. These precursor proteins are capable of
adopting an antiparallel β-pleated sheet configuration.
Renal involvement occurs most commonly in primary (AL) amyloidosis
and secondary (AA) amyloidosis, but can also be seen in some
hereditary forms of amyloidosis.
The fibrils of AL amyloid derive from monoclonal light chains. Multiple
myeloma or another lymphoproliferative disorder will be found in 20% of
patients with AL amyloidosis.
AA amyloid results from deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein in
chronic inflammatory states such as rheumatoid arthritis and familial
Mediterranean fever.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most patients present with varying degree of proteinuria (nephrotic
range in <50%) and renal insufficiency. In AL amyloidosis, monoclonal
light chains are present and are usually detected by serum (SPEP) or
urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) with immunofixation. (SIF or UIF).
Serum free light chain assay is more sensitive for detecting light chains.
Urine analysis is usually bland, but microscopic hematuria is occasionally
observed.
Renal tubular defects such as renal tubular acidosis and nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus can be seen with tubular deposits of amyloid.
Renal ultrasound usually reveals enlarged kidneys.
Deposits in other organs can cause restrictive cardiomyopathy,
hepatosplenomegaly, orthostatic hypotension, macroglossia, and
393

gastrointestinal motility and absorption problems.
Prognosis of AL amyloidosis is poor with median survival of <2
years. With the development of ESRD, survival for most patients is <1
year.
Prognosis of AA amyloidosis is good if the underlying inflammatory
process can be halted. If untreated, progression to ESRD is rapid.
Diagnostic Testing
Renal Pathology
LM demonstrates eosinophilic, amorphous hyaline deposits in the
mesangium, along the GBM, and sometimes in the blood vessels.
Subepithelial deposits may give “spikes” similar to membranous
nephropathy. The lesions are nonproliferative. Congo red staining
demonstrates apple-green birefringence under polarized light.
IF is positive for light chain staining in AL amyloidosis, usually lambda.
In AA amyloidosis, staining for SAA protein is usually positive.
On EM, amyloid fibrils are noted to be 8 to 15 nm in diameter and are
randomly oriented and nonbranching.

TREATMENT
Treatment regimens for AL amyloidosis, with or without myeloma,
consist of melphalan and glucocorticoids. Selected patients may be
candidates for high-dose melphalan and hematopoietic cell
transplantation.31 Bortezomib has shown to be beneficial in small trials
and phase III study is underway. Renal response is directly related to the
hematologic response.
Treatment of AA amyloidosis involves targeting the underlying
inflammatory process. Eprodisate, which interferes with the interaction
between amyloid fibrils and glycosaminoglycans, may have some benefit
in slowing renal progression in AA amyloidosis.32 Familial Mediterranean
394

fever, which is prevalent in Sephardic Jews, is an autosomal recessive
cause of AA amyloidosis. Colchicine is beneficial in treating this disease.

LIGHT CHAIN DEPOSITION DISEASE
Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) typically manifests as proteinuria
with renal insufficiency and is not associated with Congo red staining on
biopsy.
In 50% to 60% of cases, LCDD is associated with a lymphoproliferative
disorder, most commonly multiple myeloma. Unlike AL amyloidosis, the
light chain in LCDD is usually of the kappa subtype. Up to 30% of
patients may have a negative UPEP and SPEP. Like amyloidosis, light
chain infiltration of the heart and liver can occur.
On renal pathology, nodular mesangial matrix expansion with
hypercellularity is seen. By IF, monoclonal light chain staining is seen in
the GBM, the mesangium, and along tubular basement membranes. No
fibrillar structures are seen on EM.
Treatment regimens have been based on melphalan and prednisone.
Bortezomib has also shown efficacy in small trials.
Prognosis is better in patients with LCDD than in those with AL
amyloidosis. The 4-year patient and renal survival rates are 52% and
40%, respectively.33 LCDD recurs frequently in renal allografts.

Diabetic Nephropathy
Steven Cheng

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a result of diabetes mellitus and is the most
common cause of kidney disease in the United States.
Definition
DN is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive loss of kidney
function resulting from diabetes. The development of albuminuria is a
hallmark of this condition and is used to screen patients for DN. Although
de nitive evidence of diabetic kidney disease requires a kidney biopsy,
clinical characteristics are usually sufficient to make the diagnosis.
Epidemiology
DN is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the
United States.
Although both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can result in progressive kidney
disease, the majority of diabetic patients at ESRD have type 2 diabetes,
likely reflecting the greater prevalence of this form of the disease.
DN imparts a significant increase in both morbidity and mortality, and
the diabetic dialysis patient has a mortality rate that is 50% higher than
that of nondiabetics. Early detection and aggressive intervention is
crucial for the optimal management of this population.
Pathophysiology
Hyperglycemia plays a central role in the development of DN by
400

mediating hemodynamic and structural changes in the kidney.
The direct exposure to sustained high blood glucose concentrations
results in glycosylation of mesangial proteins, leading to mesangial
expansion and injury.
Furthermore, the hyperglycemic mileu induces several overlapping
biochemical pathways that are injurious to renal architecture. These
include the generation of advanced glycosylation end products and
reactive oxygen species, the stimulation of transforming growth factor-β
and proinflammatory cytokines.1–3
Hemodynamic changes also likely contribute to the progression of renal
disease.
Hyperfiltration at the glomerulus can be seen preceding the onset of
microalbuminuria, reflecting impaired autoregulation and increasing
glomerular pressures.4
Risk Factors
Among modifiable risk factors, control of blood glucose level is
perhaps the most obvious and most important.
A number of large studies, including the United Kingdom Prospective
Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial, have shown that poor glycemic control is associated with an
increased risk of developing microalbuminuria and other microvascular
complications of diabetes, such as retinopathy and neuropathy.5,6
The risk is increased for all hemoglobin A1C levels above the nondiabetic
range, and greatest at levels >12%.
Hypertension is also clearly associated with the development of
nephropathy.
A number of factors may contribute to the development of hypertension
in these patients, including hyperinsulinemia, fluid retention, increased
401

arterial stiffness, and the development of nephropathy.
Blood pressure measurements consistently higher than the current goal
of 130/80 mm Hg expose diabetic patients to an increased risk for the
development or progression of DN.
Obesity further increases this risk, although it is uncertain whether this
effect is independent of diabetic and glycemic control.
Nonmodifiable risk factors are also well documented.
Some have suggested that certain variations of the gene encoding the
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are associated with the
aggravation of proteinuria and overt nephropathy.7
A genetic predisposition is also supported by the fact that certain
ethnicities are at greater risk for DN; particularly those of MexicanAmerican, African-American, and Pima Indian descent.8
Age, in conjunction with duration of diabetes, was associated with an
increased risk of albuminuria in a study of type 2 diabetes from
Australia.9 The correlation of age with renal disease progression is yet
unclear in type 1 diabetes, though those diagnosed before the age of 5 are
typically at low risk for progression to ESRD.
Prevention
To prevent progression to DN, individuals with diabetes are screened for
the presence of microalbuminuria—a precursor to DN and an early
indication of renal damage.
Screening for DN consists of regular evaluations for microalbuminuria.
Microalbuminuria refers to a small quantity of albumin that can be
detected in the urine during early DN.
Microalbuminuria is the excretion of between 30 and 300 mg of
albumin in a 24-hour period.
402

Albuminuria (sometimes called macroalbuminuria) is the excretion of
>300 mg of albumin in a 24-hour period. This degree of urinary albumin
excretion characterizes the progression to DN.
Tests for microalbuminuria:
Microalbuminuria can be detected with a 24-hour urine collection.
However, this can be cumbersome and often difficult to interpret because
of improper sampling and the logistical difficulties of saving urine
through 24 hours.

A ratio of albumin-to-creatinine excretion has sufficient correlation to
24-hour protein excretion and can be used instead.
This study is often called a spot microalbumin test or a
microalbumin/creatinine ratio. The ratio of albumin excreted per gram of
creatinine correlates to the amount of albumin excreted in a 24-hour
period (see Table 19-1).
As a result, microalbuminuria is defined as 30 to 300 mg of albumin per
g of creatinine, and albuminuria is defined as >300 mg of albumin per g
of creatinine.
Screening is conducted yearly in patients with type 2 diabetes, but
can be deferred for the first 5 years in those with type 1 diabetes.
As screening for microalbuminuria requires the detection of minute
elevations in urine albumin, a routine urinalysis should not be used as
screening of DN.
If a routine urine dipstick test result is negative for protein, a spot
microalbumin screening test should still be checked, as microalbuminuria
403

may not be detected by dipstick test alone.
If a routine urine dipstick test result is positive for protein, a spot
microalbumin screening test remains necessary to quantify the extent of
albumin excretion.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The natural history and progression of kidney disease is likely similar in
both types of diabetes. However, the early course of the diabetic kidney
disease is better studied in type 1 diabetes because of a more accurate
correlation between the onset of disease and the time of diagnosis.
In type 1 diabetes, the first 5 years are typically characterized by normal
laboratory values for serum creatinine, electrolytes, and urine protein
levels.
Despite the normal laboratory values, high glucose levels lead to
glomerular hyperfiltration and the initiation of subtle histopathological
changes.
Microalbuminuria typically develops between 5 and 10 years from
diagnosis.
This is one of the earliest markers for diabetic kidney involvement and
forms the cornerstone of the screening process for DN.
From 15 to 20 years, albuminuria and hypertension develop, with a
fairly steep decline to ESRD occurring after 20 years.
Diabetic patients are frequently referred to the nephrology clinic with
albuminuria or elevations in serum creatinine levels. A complete
evaluation of such patients requires a detailed evaluation for the
presence of DN risk factors, manifestations of extra-renal microvascular
disease, and a thorough review of long-term patterns in biochemical
markers such as hemoglobin A1C, serum creatinine, and urine albumin
404

levels. The goal of this detailed investigation is twofold.
First, it is necessary to establish whether the underlying renal condition
is consistent with the pattern and progression of DN.
Second, it is crucial to identify the presence of modifiable risk factors
and to establish appropriate goals of therapy.
History
A detailed history should elicit the duration of diabetes, the level of
glycemic control, and the presence of diagnoses, suggesting other endorgan microvascular disease associated with diabetes.
As mentioned previously, patients typically develop microalbuminuria 5
to 10 years after the onset of disease. The risk of DN is further increased
in those with poor glycemic control.
During each visit, patients should be asked about adherence to the
diabetic diet and their current level of glycemic control. A written log of
recorded blood sugars is often helpful in tracking overall trends and daily
variations in glucose levels.
A concurrent history of retinopathy or neuropathy often supports the
diagnosis of DN.
Type 1 diabetics with nephropathy almost always manifest evidence of
retinopathy and/or neuropathy.10
The association is less established in type 2 diabetes. Although the
absence of retinopathy should not exclude consideration of DN in these
patients, physicians should consider alternative diagnoses as well.
Physical Examination
Blood pressure recordings should be checked routinely at each office
visit. Hypertension is a common comorbidity among diabetics and plays
an important role in both the development and progression of DN.
405

The patient’s volume status should also be carefully assessed, as an
expansion of the body’s interstitial fluid compartment, manifesting as
edema, may reflect avid sodium retention in hypertension or a loss in
oncotic pressure due to nephrotic range urinary albumin excretion.
Evidence of retinopathy and neuropathy may reflect concurrent
microvascular disease and should be evaluated with a fundoscopic and
neurologic exam.
Differential Diagnoses
Although the term “diabetic nephropathy” specifically refers to the
glomerular disease caused by the mechanisms discussed above, there are
other forms of kidney injury that can occur in the diabetic patient.
Of the other glomerular diseases, membranous nephropathy is
associated with diabetes, and can occur in longstanding diabetics
between the ages of 40 and 60 years.
Diabetics are also susceptible to the development of renal vascular
disease, which may be unmasked with the initiation of an angiotensin
antagonist, and obstructive nephropathy, which is a particular concern
among the 40% of diabetics who develop autonomic neuropathy of the
bladder.
Diabetics are more prone to developing certain infectious sequelae as
well, such as renal papillary necrosis or renal tuberculosis.
Papillary necrosis may present in individuals with frequent urinary
tract infections (UTIs) who develop hematuria, pyuria, and mild kidney
disease. A small degree of proteinuria is also common.
Renal tuberculosis may also present with sterile pyuria, hematuria, and
azotemia; the diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and the growth of
mycobacterial species in the urine.
In a diabetic who develops proteinuria or renal insufficiency, the
following should raise suspicion of a diagnosis other than DN:
406

Development of albuminuria <5 years from diabetic disease onset
Acute kidney injury
Active urine sediment
Thrombosis associated with nephrotic syndrome
Absence of retinopathy or neuropathy, particularly in type 1 diabetes
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Recent laboratory data should always be interpreted in the context of
long-term trends and current clinical contexts. A single elevation in
serum creatinine or urine albumin should be confirmed with repeat
testing, especially if there are clues to suggest a transient rise in such
markers (dehydration, febrile illnesses, UTIs, and new medications).
DN is confirmed by the persistence of albuminuria in two separate
samples separated by 3 to 6 months.
As the changes in renal function with DN typically follow a gradual but
progressive course over time, serum creatinine would initially be
expected to rise slowly, and small subtle increments are often noted when
laboratory trends over the preceding months and years are scrutinized.
Sudden fluctuations in laboratory data warrant confirmation with repeat
values and consideration of alternative diagnoses (see below).
Diagnostic Procedures
The definitive diagnosis requires renal biopsy.
Biopsy should be pursued if alternative diagnoses are being considered
due to an atypical presentation for DN.
Glomerular hypertrophy can be seen early in DN, coinciding with
mesangial expansion and thickening of the glomerular basement
407

membrane.
This typically progresses to a nodular pattern of glomerulosclerosis,
known as Kimmelstiel–Wilson nodules. Although this is often considered
the most pathognomonic lesion in DN, nodular glomerular lesions can
also be seen in other conditions, such as light-chain nephropathy and
amyloidosis.
Structural lesions outside the glomerulus include changes in renal
vasculature, tubular architecture, and the interstitium.
Hyalinosis of both afferent and efferent arterioles can be seen, and may
be particularly noticeable in patients with concurrent hypertension.
Tubular changes include thickening of the tubular basement membrane
and the Armanni–Ebstein lesion, a specific, although rarely appreciated,
manifestation of tubular glycogen deposition and subsequent tubular
vacuolization.
Tubulointerstitial fibrosis can feature prominently in patients with
longstanding DN and is suggestive of irreversible chronicity of the disease
process.

TREATMENT
Modifiable risk factors of hyperglycemia and hypertension are the
primary target of both preventive and treatment strategies. Weight
loss and smoking cessation are also thought to mediate some protective
benefit from DN. Optimal care includes the reduction of hemoglobin A1C
to levels under 7% and the reduction of blood pressure to levels under
130/80 mm Hg.
Glycemic control:
Glycemic control remains the most important modifiable risk factor and
should be pursued to a goal of Hemoglobin A1C of under 7%.
Some studies now propose a stricter goal of hemoglobin A1C <6.5%.11
408

Early and aggressive glycemic control results in a decreased incidence of
microalbuminuria as well as a decrease in the prevalence of
hypertension.
In type 1 diabetics, intensive insulin therapy has also been shown to
reduce the rate of progression from microalbuminuria to overt
albuminuria by 54%.12
Once patients develop overt nephropathy and marked albuminuria, the
evidence that strict glycemic control slows progressive renal dysfunction
is controversial. Some suggest that a lack of apparent benefit may be due
to the significant contribution of concurrent hypertensive disease. This
clearly emphasizes the importance of preventive interventions and early,
comprehensive treatment in the diabetic population.
Hypertension:
The current Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) and
Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) treatment guidelines support a
blood pressure target of <130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes
and patients with chronic kidney disease.13
In hypertensive diabetics without proteinuria, angiotensin inhibitors
and thiazide diuretics are often prescribed as first-line agents.14,15
Inhibitors of the angiotensin system are known to decrease proteinuria
and are the only agents associated with a significant reduction in the risk
of developing microalbuminuria.
Some speculate that further benefit is conferred through antiinflammatory effects of angiotensin inhibition, and not merely through
blood pressure control and the reduction of intraglomerular pressure by
efferent vasodilation.16
Often patients will require two agents to reduce blood pressure to target goal, and the combination of a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor or
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is usually necessary as well as
409

optimally protective.
Once patients develop microalbuminuria, the control of hypertension
becomes a crucial intervention to prevent progression of nephropathy
and the incidence of additional diabetic complications.
Data suggest that each 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure is
correlated with a 12% reduction in diabetic complications.17
Additionally, a more aggressive goal of 125/75 mm Hg may be more
beneficial in slowing the progression of renal disease in patients with
over 1 g of proteinuria per day.
In the context of increased urinary albumin excretion, angiotensininhibiting agents become a clear first choice among antihypertensives
based on their ability to reduce both blood pressure and albuminuria.
Albuminuria:
Albuminuria is often used as a surrogate marker for the extent of renal
involvement, but there is expanding evidence to suggest that it is an
independent risk factor associated with further disease progression.
Studies suggest that a reduction in albuminuria may confer
improvements in both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.18,19
In trials using ACE inhibitors and ARBs in diabetic patients with
proteinuria, the reduction of proteinuria was associated with reduced risk
of progressive renal dysfunction.20–23
This beneficial effect is independent of blood pressure reduction, and has
been demonstrated in trials comparing angiotensin-inhibiting agents to
other antihypertensive medications titrated to equivalent blood pressure
control.22,23
The question of whether ACE inhibitors and ARBs are equivalent has not
yet been fully answered, though in clinical practice they are frequently
used interchangeably.
410

One comparison of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in type 2 diabetics showed
no significant differences in the primary end point (decline in glomerular
filtration rate) or secondary end points (blood pressure control,
albuminuria, serum creatinine, ESRD, cardiovascular end points, and
death).24
Another area of controversy involves the combination of ACE inhibitors
and ARBs for maximal reduction of proteinuria. Although this
combination has been shown to reduce severe proteinuria in nondiabetic
patients,25 the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should
generally be avoided due to the increased risk of adverse effects.
Direct renin inhibitors have also been used in conjunction with ARBs and
have demonstrated a decrease in proteinuria among patients with DN.
However, its utility as a single agent has not yet been demonstrated.26

COMPLICATIONS
Clinical complications that may result from DN or the treatment of DN
include hypoglycemia, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and metabolic
acidosis.
Hypoglycemia:
Pharmacological agents should be dosed with careful consideration of
diminished renal clearances in patients who develop DN. Although
glycemic control should be pursued by any means possible, the degree of
renal insufficiency must be considered in the selection and titration of
pharmacological agents.
The clearance of the biguanide metformin is notably decreased in the
setting of impaired renal function, predisposing patients with renal
disease to lactic acidosis. Metformin is not recommended for patients
with a creatinine clearance of <60 to 70 mL/min.
Sulfonylureas are also not recommended in patients with a clearance of
<50 mL/min because of the increased risk of severe hypoglycemia.
Routine calculations of a patient’s estimated renal function can be done
411

using formulas described elsewhere in this book and may serve as a
reminder to dose drugs appropriately in the clinical setting.
Acute renal failure:
Acute renal failure is manifested by a sudden increase in creatinine that
exceeds the predicted gradual decline of function seen with DN.
Both pre- and postrenal etiologies should be kept in mind, as diabetics
are prone to both intravascular depletion and obstruction due to
autonomic neuropathies.
An elevation in creatinine is often encountered in patients initiating on
an angiotensin-inhibiting agent.
This usually reflects an expected physiological response to the change in
glomerular filtration with efferent arterial vasodilation.
However, a rise in creatinine of >30% should prompt the cessation of
the ACE inhibitor or ARB until renal function returns to baseline.
A slow retitration with gradual dose increments is warranted for most
patients, given the known benefits of angiotensin inhibition in this
population.
An evaluation for unmasked renal artery stenosis may be appropriate as
well.
Hyperkalemia:
Hyperkalemia is another complication often associated with the
institution of angiotensin-inhibiting agents in diabetic patients.
Serum potassium levels under 5.5 mEq/L can be managed medically.
Dietary potassium restriction and the titration of diuretics, particularly
loop diuretics, are usually sufficient to lower potassium levels and
promote kaliuresis.
For more severe cases of hyperkalemia, a decrease or cessation of dose
412

may be necessary. After normalization of potassium levels and dietary
education, a gradual retitration can be attempted.
Diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease may also develop a type 4
renal tubular acidosis that may manifest as hyperkalemia with a
nonanion gap metabolic acidosis.
The hyperkalemia, which results from hyporeninemic
hypoaldosteronism, impairs the generation of ammonia necessary for
sufficient acid excretion, resulting in a metabolic acidosis.
Although type 4 renal tubular acidosis is often managed with
mineralocorticoid replacement, the potential for exacerbation of fluid
retention or hypertension often limits clinical application.
The institution of dietary potassium restriction and the stimulation of
potassium excretion with diuretics can be used to control the
hyperkalemia and restore normal ammoniagenesis.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients with overt nephropathy should be followed regularly in the
nephrology clinic. Achievement of glycemic goals, attainment of
adequate blood pressure control, and maximal reduction of albuminuria
should be checked at each visit. In those with progressive nephropathy,
management of common complications of chronic kidney disease,
including anemia and renal osteodystrophy, should be addressed as
discussed elsewhere in this book.

Renal Artery Stenosis and
Renovascular Hypertension
Ahsan Usman

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Renovascular hypertension (RVHTN) is a common cause of secondary
hypertension in adults. The structural finding of a narrowed renal artery
alone defines renal artery stenosis (RAS). RVHTN is the resultant increase
in blood pressure produced from decreased renal perfusion because of a
stenotic lesion in the renal artery(s).
Injury to the renal parenchyma can occur from decreased renal perfusion
as well, resulting in a decrease in kidney function known as ischemic
nephropathy.
It is often thought that hypertension in a patient with RAS is caused by
the stenotic lesion and the physiologic response of the kidney. However,
it is likely to be a more complex process.
RAS can be found incidentally in patients without hypertension and
with normal renal function. Moreover, correcting the lesion may or may
not improve blood pressure control or renal function.
Thus, the diagnosis and management of renal artery disease and
hypertension requires experience, use of clinical and prognostic factors,
and a good understanding of interventions and outcomes.
Causes of RAS
Atherosclerotic renal vascular disease (ASRVD) is the most common
cause of RAS (80% of cases).
417

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the second most common cause of
RAS (∼20%).
Other causes of RAS include vasculitis (i.e., polyarteritis nodosa,
Takayasu arteritis), aortic or arterial aneurysm (including dissection),
embolic disease, trauma, radiation, or mass effect. These are extremely
rare.
Epidemiology
Atherosclerotic Renovascular Disease
The prevalence of RAS in the general population is unclear, as most data
are from autopsy series or patients undergoing angiography for
evaluation of other atherosclerotic disease (e.g., cardiac catheterization
or lower extremity angiography). In addition, methods and criteria for
defining a significant stenosis vary.
The prevalence of RAS does not equal the prevalence of RVHTN, because
a causal relationship is not always clear. A large autopsy study noted RAS
in 4.3% of cases, and if there was a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
the incidence was as high as 8.3%. A combined history of type 2 diabetes
and hypertension was associated with a 10% risk of RAS.1,2
Population-based studies using Doppler techniques in persons aged >65
years found RAS in 6.8% (males, 9.1%; females, 5.5%). RAS was
unilateral in 88% of cases and bilateral in 12%. Medicare claims from
1999 to 2001 showed an incidence of newly diagnosed ASRVD of 3.7 per
1000 patient years. Follow-up of this group for another 2 years showed
that cardiovascular events from atherosclerotic heart disease in the
incident ASRVD patients were higher than in the general population (304
vs. 73 per 1000 patient years).
It stands to reason that patients with atherosclerotic disease of other
vascular beds would be more likely to have ASRVD. For instance, RAS of
>50% can be found incidentally in up to 20% of patients undergoing
coronary angiography. A finding of RAS of >75% in this setting is an
independent predictor of all-cause mortality. In patients undergoing
418

angiography for atherosclerotic disease in the aorta or legs, RAS of
>50% can be seen in up to 50% of the cases.3,4
Ischemic nephropathy is defined as the diminution of renal function
due to low blood flow caused by an obstructive lesion in the renal artery.
According to the U.S. Renal Data System report from 2000 to 2004, the
incidence of ESRD from RAS was 1.8%. Other studies suggest that
ischemic nephropathy may be the cause of ESRD in up to 11% to 15%
of cases. As the elderly population in the United States is steadily
increasing, it is also expected that the incidence of RAS and ischemic
nephropathy will rise.5
Fibromuscular Dysplasia
FMD is most common in women with onset of hypertension below 30
years of age or in women under the age of 50 years with refractory
or suddenly worsening hypertension. The most common form of FMD
is medial fibroplasias, present with the classic “string of beads”
appearance on the angiogram. Other arteries may also be affected in this
disease.
Pathophysiology
In 1934, Goldblatt experimentally produced hypertension in dogs by
clamping their renal arteries, demonstrating that decreasing perfusion to
the kidney(s) could cause systemic hypertension.
For a lesion to cause significant hemodynamic impairment of blood flow
through the renal artery, it must occlude the luminal diameter of the
artery by 75% to 80%. When this critical level of stenosis is reached,
numerous mechanisms are activated in an attempt to restore renal
perfusion. Fundamental to this process is the production of renin in the
juxtaglomerular apparatus, which then activates the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system (RAAS).
Subsequently, systemic arterial pressure increases until renal perfusion is
restored or improved. By experimentally blocking the RAAS, medically or
by genetic knockout in animal models for the angiotensin II 1A receptor,
419

this rise in systemic arterial pressure can be prevented.6
Other mechanisms may play a larger role in the long-term elevation of
blood pressure such as chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous
system, activation of oxidative stress pathways, impaired nitric oxide
production, endothelin production, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
Maintenance of Hypertension
Mechanisms of continued RVHTN depend on whether the RAS affects one
or both kidneys. The terminology that has evolved from experimental
animal models illustrates pathophysiologic concepts in human disease.
The Goldblatt 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) model represents unilateral RAS
in a patient with two functioning kidneys. Central to this concept is the
fact that the kidney contralateral to the stenosis is normal and
experiences increased perfusion pressure. This kidney adapts to the
increased arterial pressure with local suppression of the RAAS and
excretion of excess sodium and water. Because of normalization of
volume status, poor perfusion to the stenotic kidney is maintained and
persistent activation of the RAAS in this kidney occurs. This model is
known as angiotensin II-dependent RVHTN.7
The 1-kidney, 1-clip (1C1K) model means that the entire renal mass is
distal to a hemodynamically significant stenosis, whether this is bilateral
RAS in a patient with two functioning kidneys or unilateral RAS in a
patient with a single functioning kidney. In the 1C1K model, the entire
renal mass is underperfused, leading to RAAS activation with sodium
retention and volume expansion leading to increased renal perfusion
pressure. Once this occurs, the RAAS is then suppressed and hypertension
is thought to be more related to persistent volume expansion. This
scenario is known as angiotensin-independent or volume-dependent
RVHTN.7

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
420

There are no clinical characteristics that absolutely differentiate RVHTN
from other causes of hypertension.
Features that may be of use include acute onset of moderate-to-severe
hypertension early or late in life, and hypertension refractory to
standard therapy. A list of characteristics that raise clinical suspicion
are given in Table 20-1.
Improved and more aggressive medical treatments for hypertension
make refractory hypertension less common; therefore, one should have a
high index of suspicion when evaluating patients with hypertension.
Early recognition of RVHTN is thought to be important, as success of
revascularization appears to be inversely related to the duration of
hypertension.

Episodes of recurrent flash pulmonary edema with accelerated
hypertension should raise the suspicion of RVHTN and are more
commonly found in patients with bilateral disease. This is related to the
pathophysiology of the 1C1K model and the resultant tendency toward
volume overload and to left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic
dysfunction.
One series showed that RVHTN was present in 30% of patients reporting
to the emergency department with accelerated hypertension and severe
hypertensive retinopathy (grade III/grade IV Keith–Wagner changes).8
421

A significant and persistent rise (at least 30% to 40%) in serum
creatinine after initiation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) suggests
the presence of bilateral RAS or RAS in a patient with a single
functioning kidney.
Other characteristics associated with RVHTN include smoking, elevated
cholesterol, increased body mass index, and progressive renal failure.
Reports suggest that RVHTN may rarely be associated with nephrotic
range proteinuria.
Patients may have polydipsia with hyponatremia secondary to the
dipsogenic properties of angiotensin II and may have hypokalemia
related to increased aldosterone activity.9,10
Diagnostic Testing
Before embarking on an extensive diagnostic evaluation for renal artery
disease, the clinician should consider whether further intervention will
occur if disease is found. Renal artery disease is a relatively common
unsuspected finding in certain high-risk groups, as discussed above.
Most experts only advocate looking for RAS if it is deemed that the
patient would benefit from revascularization therapy. Factors such
as comorbid conditions, age, and risk of intervention should be
considered in the decision process (see Table 20-2).
Given that functional tests measuring renin activity in the blood lack
statistical power for diagnosis, radiographic imaging of the renal
vasculature has become the primary approach to RAS diagnosis. The test
chosen depends on institutional expertise, but less-invasive tests are
generally preferred initially.
Imaging
Renal ultrasound with Doppler:
Blood flow velocities in the renal arteries and aorta are measured using
422

ultrasound with Doppler examination for RAS. Higher velocities indicate
a narrowed luminal diameter.

Doppler ultrasound is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and
extends little, if any, risk to the patient. Peak systolic velocities of
>180 cm/s are consistent with RAS.
Ultrasound also allows for assessment of kidney size, asymmetry, as well
as other structural abnormalities such as cysts or obstruction.11 Small
kidneys suggest chronic damage, with very low likelihood of
improvement in renal function after revascularization.
Resistive index (RI) can be measured by Doppler ultrasonography and
is a measure of overall resistance to renal arterial blood flow. Evidence
suggests that a RI >0.8 is associated with a higher degree of irreversible
intrarenal vascular or parenchymal disease, and the kidney may be less
functional. Therefore, the RI may be helpful in predicting the response
to revascularization. Larger studies are needed to further determine its
predictive value.12
Disadvantages of renal Doppler ultrasonography are that it is highly
dependent on patient body habitus, operator skill, interpreter expertise,
and the type of equipment. For these reasons, the sensitivity and
specificity vary in the literature, but can be as high as 98% when
proficiency is great. Technology and expertise with Doppler ultrasound is
growing and it is now often utilized as an initial test for RAS.
Spiral computed tomography (CT) scan and CT angiography:
CT scanning with CT angiography is a highly sensitive and specific tool
for the diagnosis of RAS. However, it is invasive and requires
administration of iodinated contrast, which places the patient at high risk
423

for contrast-induced nephropathy. Therefore, CT angiogram is not
performed at most centers for diagnosis of RAS.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA):
MRA is being increasingly used as the initial test for RAS. It is also highly
sensitive and specific and is noninvasive. It is less operator dependent
compared with Doppler ultrasound.
Iodinated contrast is not required, as in CT angiography. On the other
hand, gadolinium has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis
in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and should be
used with caution.
MRA tends to slightly overestimate the severity of a stenotic lesion when
compared with angiography because of issues related to maximum spatial
resolution.
MRA is contraindicated in patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants,
intracranial aneurysm clips, or other metallic implants.
Renal angiography:
The gold standard for the diagnosis of RAS is still renal
angiography. Problems with this procedure include its invasiveness and
risk of catheter-induced injury, such as atheroemboli and arterial
dissection.
Patients are also at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, although
digital imaging procedures and use of carbon dioxide as the contrast
medium can minimize this complication.
Angiography is now usually performed only at the time of a
percutaneous intervention after another less-invasive test has made the
diagnosis of RAS very likely. If noninvasive testing is inconclusive,
angiography should be performed.
Functional Testing
424

Knowledge of the pathophysiology of RVHTN can be used to help
determine the physiologic significance of a stenotic lesion and possibly
whether or not it is contributing to or causing RVHTN. These tests are
most helpful in patients with unilateral disease and with normal renal
function.
Captopril plasma renin activity:
Although increased renin production, measured as plasma renin activity
(PRA), is fundamental to the initial rise in blood pressure, the chronic
elevation of blood pressure in RVHTN is thought to be from other
mechanisms, as noted in the pathophysiology section in this chapter.
Renin levels can fall within a few weeks, despite persistently elevated
blood pressure. Renin levels are also highly dependent on other factors
such as sodium intake, posture, age, race, gender, and medications.
Consequently, the usefulness of PRA alone in the evaluation of RVHTN is
extremely limited. On the other hand, the predictive value of PRA
measurement can be increased by measuring it 1 hour after
administration of 25 to 50 mg of captopril, a rapid-acting ACEI. This is
called the captopril PRA or the captopril stimulation test.
If RVHTN is being maintained by high angiotensin II levels, renin will be
suppressed by normal negative feedback mechanisms. ACE inhibition
will remove this suppression, and renin production from the stenotic
kidney should increase.
A major limitation of this test is that antihypertensive medications,
including ACEIs, ARBs, diuretics, and β-blockers, must be held for up to
2 weeks prior to the test.
The test should not be performed in patients with congestive heart
failure, edema, cardiovascular instability, or significant renal
dysfunction.
Sensitivities and specificities in the literature, when done properly, have
ranged from 75% to 100% and 60% to 95%, respectively. It may be
lower in those with preexisting renal dysfunction.
425

Captopril radionuclide renogram:
Radionuclide imaging of the kidneys can be helpful in evaluating the
individual contribution of each kidney to the glomerular filtration rate
(GFR).
However, its use in diagnosing RAS has a false-positive rate of up to
25%. When combined with the administration of captopril, similar to the
captopril PRA, the predictive value can be improved. A rapid-acting
intravenous ACEI, such as enalaprilat, is used at some institutions.
In the kidney distal to a stenosis, GFR is maintained by the efferent
arteriolar constrictive effects of angiotensin II. When angiotensin II is
blocked by captopril, efferent arteriolar dilatation occurs and GFR in the
stenotic kidney often decreases, usually with a corresponding increase in
GFR in the nonstenotic kidney. When a radioactive isotope such as Tc99m diethylene-​triamine-penta-acetic acid (DTPA) is given in this setting
to measure GFR, the stenotic kidney will exhibit decreased uptake
with a delayed peak time and a slower washout time compared with
the nonstenotic kidney.
ACEIs or ARBs must be held prior to this test, but other antihypertensive
agents can be continued and loop diuretics may even enhance the
sensitivity.
A positive captopril renogram indicates the presence of a
physiologically significant stenosis that is likely causing RVHTN.
Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that it can predict a good blood
pressure response after percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty
(PTRA), with a sensitivity of 90%.
This test has a lower sensitivity in CKD and is generally not used in this
setting.

TREATMENT
Natural History

426

As with any disease, the approach to management must take into
account the natural history of the disease.
Recent prospective studies using Doppler ultrasound show that
progression of ASRVD may not occur as frequently and rapidly as was
once thought.
Progression can occur in as many as 30% of higher-risk patients at 3
years, or as little as 4% in lower-risk patients followed up to 8 years.
Progression of disease is related to the initial degree of stenosis.
Progression to complete occlusion may develop in up to 3% to 7% of
patients. Risk factors for progression are still poorly understood, but
appear to be similar to risk factors for general atherosclerotic disease.13
Complicating matters further, progression of a stenotic lesion may not
translate clinically into worsening hypertension or renal function. In a
group of patients with high-grade RAS (>70%) followed up for just over
3 years, only 8% eventually required revascularization for refractory
hypertension. In the entire group, antihypertensive medication
requirement increased, but blood pressure remained relatively unchanged
and creatinine rose from 1.4 to 2 mg/dL. This increase in serum
creatinine was more pronounced in patients with bilateral RAS. Mortality
in this group was 30% and was primarily due to cardiovascular disease.14
As described above, the finding of a high-grade stenosis has been shown
to be an independent predictor for all-cause mortality, and patients with
ASRVD have been shown to have a higher incidence of atherothrombotic
cardiovascular events than the general population.
It is possible that the long-term neuroendocrine defects caused by
ASRVD could contribute to worsening cardiovascular disease.
Therefore, end points of therapy should not only be targeted at blood
pressure control and preservation of renal function but should also
include reduction in cardiovascular events overall.15,16
Indications for Intervention

427

Patients with newly diagnosed, accelerated hypertension and rapidly
progressive kidney disease found to have RAS will most likely benefit
from revascularization (see Tables 20-2 and 20-3). Other indications for
revascularization include recurrent episodes of congestive heart
failure or flash pulmonary edema.17
The most common dilemma regarding intervention is the patient with
ASRVD who has well-controlled hypertension and stable renal function.
Even though the presence of ASRVD portends a higher likelihood of a
future cardiovascular event, intervening may or may not change that
risk.18,19

Present therapy available for RVHTN and ischemic nephropathy includes
medical management, PTRA with or without stent placement, and
surgical revascularization.20
Medical Management
Aggressive medical therapy targeted at reducing atherosclerotic disease
is recommended in all patients with ASRVD. This includes smoking
cessation, control of dyslipidemia (usually with statins and low-density
lipoprotein goal of <70 mg/dL), glycemic control, aspirin, and
blood pressure control according to Joint National Committee (JNC) 7
goals.21
ACEIs and ARBs are the preferred first-line agents, as they have proven
benefit in RAS and cardiovascular disease. It is rare for patients to
experience a clinically significant drop in their GFR after initiation of
these agents, but close monitoring of serum creatinine and
optimization of volume status after initiation of these drugs is
428

recommended.22,23
If GFR does decline, it is usually in a patient with bilateral disease or RAS
in a single functioning kidney, and revascularization should be
considered.
Refractory hypertension is generally defined as inadequate control
with three medications, and in this case revascularization may be
considered, but it is unclear if it is beneficial. Even after successful
revascularization is performed, medical management is usually necessary
and the ability to discontinue all antihypertensive drugs is rare.24
Angioplasty and Stent Placement
PTRA is the preferred revascularization procedure in most institutions.
Owing to high rates of restenosis with balloon angioplasty alone,
especially with ostial lesions, stent deployment has been increasingly
utilized. This has improved technical success and is now the most widely
used procedure for revascularization of RAS.
Unfortunately, technical success does not guarantee “cure” of
hypertension. In fact, three recent prospective randomized controlled
trials comparing PTRA with medical therapy alone failed to show a blood
pressure difference between the groups. In other analyses, the literature
has concluded that there is evidence to support trends toward
improvement (not cure) in blood pressure control and renal function with
angioplasty compared with medical therapy alone.25,26
The recently published, randomized controlled ASTRAL trial
(Angioplasty and STenting for Renal Artery Lesions) is the largest study
(860 patients) to date in this population and the first trial that analyzed
hard end points––renal and cardiovascular events and mortality. It
randomized patients with RAS to medical management versus
percutaneous renal revascularization, and patients were followed for 34
months. Both groups had similar blood pressure control, but patients in
the medical arm were taking slightly higher number of blood pressure
medications at 1-year follow-up. However, there was no difference in
renal function or the number of cardiovascular events in both groups.
429

There were higher number of amputations in the intervention arm, due to
cholesterol emboli after the procedure.27
Given these new data, the decision for revascularization in a patient with
RAS should be made after careful assessment of the clinical information
and should be individualized. The potential benefits and risks should be
explained to the patient in detail. Figure 20-1 outlines the treatment
algorithm for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

FIGURE 20-1. Approach to treatment.
Risks of PTRA
Restenosis is estimated to occur in 15% to 20% of cases. Contrast
nephropathy complicates the procedure up to 13% of the time but is selflimited. Conversely, acute and progressive deterioration in renal function
has been reported to have an incidence of up to 20% in some series.
Atheroembolic disease is thought to be responsible for a majority of these
cases. Studies using distal filter devices after stent placement show that
atheroembolic debris can be recovered almost all the time and that by
using these devices postprocedure renal function deterioration is less
430

frequent.
Other complications are renal artery dissection, renal artery
thrombosis, and segmental renal infarction. Periprocedural death or
cardiovascular events each occur with a reported incidence of up to 3%.
In ASTRAL trial, 23 patients out of 403 patients in the revascularization
arm experienced serious complications, including 2 deaths and 3
amputations.27
Surgery
Before the era of interventional radiology, surgery was the definitive
treatment for RAS. Now, it is reserved for situations in which
revascularization is necessary but cannot be achieved by the
percutaneous route.
Treatment of FMD
The decision to perform revascularization with PTRA or surgery is less
controversial with FMD than with atherosclerotic disease and is usually
recommended. Intervention results in a cure or improvement of
hypertension in 70% to 90% of patients.28

Cystic Diseases of the Kidney
Seth Goldberg

POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
Polycystic kidney disease has two well-defined autosomal dominant
forms (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 1 [ADPKD1] and
ADPKD2) as well as one with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern
(ARPKD).
ARPKD leads to severe renal failure in infancy, while both ADPKD forms
can remain asymptomatic for several decades before renal dysfunction is
evident.
Epidemiology
ADPKD has an incidence of 1 in 400 to 1000 live births, with no racial or
gender predilection; ∼85% have a defect in the PKD1 gene (chromosome
16); whereas 15% have a defect at the PKD2 locus (chromosome 4).
ARPKD has an incidence of 1 in 10,000 to 40,000 live births.
Pathophysiology
The gene products of PKD1 (polycystin-1) and PKD2 (polycystin-2)
localize to the primary cilia of the nephron, the hepatic bile, and
pancreatic ductal epithelium, and to various other tissues in the body.
These gene products are thought to play a role in flow-mediated
mechanosensation as well as cell–cell interactions, and defects lead to
abnormal epithelial cell proliferation.
435

In ADPKD, epithelial cells proliferate in response to a variety of signals;
vasopressin signaling may be impaired and affected cells show an
abnormal response to increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP).
It is unclear why ADPKD has such a variable course even between related
patients; only a small percentage of tubules develop cysts, suggesting
that a “second-hit” somatic mutation to the normal allele is required to
initiate cystogenesis.
As the cysts enlarge, they become walled off from the rest of the
collecting system, explaining why events occurring within the cyst (such
as hemorrhage or infection) may not be evident in the urine.
Enlarging cysts may impinge upon the blood flow to normal nephrons,
leading to resistant hypertension and interstitial fibrosis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Diagnosis is often delayed because the disease is asymptomatic until
late in the course.
It is frequently discovered on abdominal imaging performed for an
alternate indication; ADPKD-specific reasons for ultrasonography include
unexplained early-onset hypertension, elevated creatinine, or pain from
an expanding cyst, cyst hemorrhage, or cyst infection.
History
The history should include an in-depth family history, including
relatives who may have required dialysis or a transplant and the age that
they reached end-stage renal disease.
Family history of cerebral aneurysms or sudden death of unknown
etiology must be ascertained, as this would put the patient at risk for a
similar event and necessitate screening.
436

A personal history of headaches or neurological symptoms must be
sought.
Flank and abdominal pain may be suggestive of symptomatic renal or
hepatic cysts.
A history of hematuria, dysuria, and nephrolithiasis should be
investigated.
Caffeine intake should be quantified.1
In women, the history of estrogen exposure (pregnancy, contraception,
hormone replacement therapy) should be assessed.
Physical Examination
The physical examination is often normal in the early stages of
ADPKD.
The first presenting sign of an underlying problem is frequently earlyonset hypertension.
As the kidneys progressively enlarge, the cysts may be palpable on
abdominal examination.
Hepatic cysts may also be palpable and elicit epigastric tenderness.
Cardiac auscultation may reveal the mid-systolic click of mitral stenosis.
Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnosis of ADPKD is made using the combination of renal cysts,
family history, and the constellation of extrarenal manifestations.
Ultrasound diagnostic criteria have been established for patients at
risk for type 1 ADPKD (Table 21-1); however, the absence of cysts in a
patient under the age of 30 does not rule out the disease.2
As computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging
437

(MRI) can detect smaller cysts, the conventional diagnostic criteria do
not apply to these modalities and no guidelines have been validated.
The use of MRI technology is primarily limited to the research setting,
where the growth rate of kidney and cyst volume can be measured as a
surrogate marker for disease progression.3,4

Commercial genetic testing is available for ADPKD (types 1 and 2),
with use primarily in young patients contemplating living kidney
donation to an affected family member in order to rule out subclinical
disease; the accuracy of the test depends on identifying the specific
mutation (which differs between families) and so the utility of the genetic
test is limited in patients with few or no affected relatives.
Routine screening of at-risk family members (with ultrasonography or
genetic testing) is not currently recommended, as there is no specific
disease-modifying therapy available for the asymptomatic patient; early
diagnosis may lead to emotional anguish and possible difficulties in
obtaining health insurance.
It is, however, prudent for at-risk relatives to obtain regular blood
pressure checks, and to pursue further evaluation if indicated.
Differential Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ADPKD is not difficult when there is an established
family history of disease; when absent, the possibility of an alternative
renal cystic disease must be excluded.
Acquired cystic disease in the presence of renal dysfunction typically
exhibits small, shrunken kidneys.

438

The cysts in medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD) are often a late
manifestation, with small-to-normal–sized smooth-contoured kidneys and
cysts confined to the corticomedullary junction or renal medulla.
Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) can also be distinguished from ADPKD
by the medullary location of the cysts and collecting duct dilation.
Solid renal nodules are uncommon in ADPKD, but may be seen in
tuberous sclerosis and von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome.
The presence of extrarenal manifestations, such as hepatic cysts, can be a
helpful clue to make the diagnosis of ADPKD.

TREATMENT
There is no specific therapy currently available for ADPKD, although
numerous medications are being studied for efficacy and safety
(vasopressin antagonists, water therapy, inhibitors of the mammalian
target of rapamycin, somatostatin analogues, growth factor receptor
blockers).5,6
Management is primarily centered on strict blood pressure control and
addressing the complications of chronic kidney disease as they develop.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
blockers are considered first-line antihypertensive agents.
Anemia is not often an early problem for these patients, as compared to
other causes of chronic kidney disease, because of the production of
erythropoietin by cells surrounding the cysts.
Caffeine intake should be reduced or avoided, as animal models have
implicated caffeine as a promoter of cyst growth; however, evidence in
human studies is not available.
Large-volume surgical cyst reduction does not affect long-term renal
outcomes, although selected aspiration and sclerosis of severely
symptomatic renal or hepatic cysts can provide relief.
439

COMPLICATIONS
Renal Manifestations
Hematuria is a common finding in patients with ADPKD and may
represent a ruptured cyst, nephrolithiasis, or infection.
Cyst hemorrhage is self-limited, lasting for several days to 1 to 2 weeks
and can be very painful; as cysts may have become walled off from the
rest of the urinary tract, hematuria is not always present. Cyst
hemorrhage is treated conservatively with oral hydration, bed rest, and
analgesia.
Cyst infection may present with fever, dysuria, pyuria, and flank pain;
however, as with cyst hemorrhage, there may not be direct
communication with the rest of the collecting system and so lower
urinary findings may be minimal and the urine culture may be negative.
Treatment of cyst infection should include an antibiotic with good cyst
penetration (ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim, or
chloramphenicol) for at least 3 to 4 weeks.
Nephrolithiasis can occur in patients with ADPKD, with an increased
frequency of uric acid stones as compared to the general population;
calcium-based stones are also common in this group.
A full metabolic stone workup should be performed in ADPKD patients
with nephrolithiasis to look for hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria,
hyperuricosuria, and low urine volume.
Hypertension in this population is thought to be mediated, at least
partially, through activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis
through local ischemia from external compression by enlarging cysts; the
onset of hypertension is often early, with preserved renal filtration.
A concentrating defect is generally mild and may be seen early in the
disease course; this may be accounted for by vasopressin receptor (V2)
signaling abnormalities.

440

Extrarenal Manifestations
Liver cysts are common and are present in up to 80% of patients with
ADPKD; progression to liver dysfunction, however, is very uncommon.
Liver enlargement may lead to abdominal fullness, discomfort, or early
satiety; in unusual circumstances, the pain may be severe enough as to
prompt cyst drainage with sclerosis or surgical unroofing.
Liver cysts are more common in women with increased estrogen
exposure.
Cerebral aneurysms constitute the most serious extrarenal
manifestation and are found to cluster within families with certain
mutations.
When there is a family history of a cerebral aneurysm or sudden death of
unknown cause, the incidence is increased to 20%; in the absence of such
a family history, the risk is no greater than in the general population (1%
to 2%).
The risk of aneurysm rupture is greater in patients with uncontrolled
hypertension.
Patients with neurological symptoms or those with a family history of
cerebral aneurysms should undergo magnetic resonance angiography
testing; others who should be screened include patients with high-risk
occupations in which loss of consciousness would put others at risk (such
as commercial pilots), patients needing anticoagulation, or those
undergoing surgery with potential hemodynamic instability.
Smaller cysts (<5 to 7 mm) may be followed serially by a neurosurgeon,
while those that are at higher risk of rupture should undergo repair.
For patients at increased risk for cerebral aneurysms but with negative
scans, reimaging at 10 years can be performed to detect new lesions.
Colonic diverticulosis occurs with greater frequency in patients with
ADPKD with a higher risk of perforation compared to the general
441

population.
Cardiac valvular disease, particularly mitral valve prolapsed, is
common in ADPKD patients; most are asymptomatic, although antibiotic
prophylaxis for invasive procedures is recommended in these patients.
Abdominal wall hernias occur with increased frequency, and may
worsen if peritoneal dialysis is pursued in these patients without surgical
correction.

PATIENT EDUCATION
All patients with ADPKD should be counseled regarding the mode of
inheritance and the 50% risk to each offspring.
Other relatives may also be at risk (depending on whether the patient’s
disease is familial or sporadic); however, routine screening is not
currently recommended as there is yet no disease-modifying therapy
available.
Monitoring of blood pressure and for neurological symptoms suggestive
of cerebral aneurysm should be undertaken in at-risk family members,
and ultrasonography should be performed only if the results would
significantly alter management.
Although the exact nature of the risk has not been defined, patients
should be counseled in restricting caffeine intake and avoiding estrogenbased therapies.

PROGNOSIS
At the present time, without proven therapies to slow cyst growth, the
typical outcome is progression toward end-stage renal disease.
In ADPKD1, ∼50% of patients require renal replacement therapy by the
age of 60; this is delayed by 15 years in ADPKD2.
Appropriate candidates for renal transplantation should be identified and
442

evaluated early, anticipating their need for renal replacement therapy to
minimize or entirely avoid time spent on dialysis.

SIMPLE RENAL CYSTS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Simple renal cysts are very common in the general population (5%) and
can be found in healthy kidneys.
Prevalence increases with age, with roughly one-quarter of the general
population having a simple cyst on ultrasound by the age of 50.
Pathophysiology
Simple cysts are typically solitary, but the finding of multiple cysts is not
uncommon.
They can be unilocular or multilocular.
They are lined with a single layer of flattened epithelial cells and are
confined to the renal cortex.
The etiology of simple cyst formation is not fully understood.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Simple cysts are almost always asymptomatic, usually found
incidentally on imaging for an alternate purpose.
In rare circumstances, large cysts (>10 cm in diameter) can cause local
symptoms such as a palpable abdominal mass or abdominal pain.
Cyst infection, hemorrhage, or urinary obstruction (if near the renal
pelvis) rarely complicate simple cysts.
443

Renal function is typically preserved, although hypertension may be
noted if the cyst compresses a large vessel.
Diagnostic Criteria
Size is quite variable, and can range from <1 cm to >10 cm in diameter.
Ultrasonography is the best initial modality to evaluate simple cysts.
Typically, on ultrasound, simple cysts are (a) anechoic, (b) round in
shape with smooth walls, and (c) exhibit sharp definition of the posterior
wall with a strong acoustic enhancement.
Scanning under CT can further characterize renal cysts, should the
diagnosis be in question.7
Differential Diagnosis
Simple cysts can be differentiated from polycystic disease by their fewer
numbers, lack of extrarenal manifestations, normal kidney size and
function, and lack of family history.
Unlike acquired cystic disease, simple cysts are generally associated with
a normal creatinine level (unless a separate disease has caused renal
dysfunction).
The primary differential is to distinguish simple cysts from malignant
masses.
If the appearance is typical for a simple cyst on ultrasonography, no
further evaluation is indicated; the Bosniak classification system on CT
scanning (Table 21-2) can help characterize the lesion if there is still
concern, with categories III and IV needing surgical evaluation as the risk
of malignancy is high.

TREATMENT
Almost all simple cysts are asymptomatic and require no specific
therapy.
444

Pain from a large cyst is managed conservatively.
If clinically warranted, a painful cyst resistant to therapy can be
aspirated and sclerosed by either a percutaneous or surgical route.

PROGNOSIS
Simple cysts do not cause progressive renal dysfunction.
If there is a decline in renal function, obstruction should be ruled out and
an alternative explanation sought.

ACQUIRED RENAL CYSTS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Acquired cystic disease occurs in patients with advanced chronic kidney
disease or end-stage renal disease.
445

The incidence increases with time on dialysis, with up to 90% of patients
affected after 10 years or more.
African-American men tend to develop the disease earlier in the course.
Pathophysiology
Chronic uremia with compensatory hyperplasia of the nephron is
believed to underlie the development of acquired cystic disease, with
bilateral involvement in most cases.
Cysts form primarily from the proximal tubules with epithelial
hyperplasia.
The overall size of the kidney tends to be small to normal, as opposed to
the massive enlargement frequently seen in ADPKD.
Transformation into renal cell carcinoma occurs more frequently than in
the absence of acquired cystic disease; the papillary subtype
predominates as opposed to otherwise more common clear cell or
granular subtypes.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Most often, acquired cystic disease is asymptomatic.
Cyst hemorrhage can occur, presenting with flank or back pain as well as
hematuria.
Pain may arise from an enlarging cyst itself, although this is uncommon.
Diagnostic Criteria
Ultrasonography can easily identify cysts; however, CT/MRI is
recommended for evaluating symptomatic patients or those with
suspicious cysts.

446

Screening for transformation into renal cell carcinoma remains
controversial, given the typically reduced life expectancy in patients on
dialysis; patients who have extended life expectancies, have survived on
dialysis for more than 3 years, or who are being evaluated for
transplantation may benefit from screening, although formalized
guidelines are not available.8
Differential Diagnosis
Acquired cystic disease can be distinguished from ADPKD, as the kidneys
remain small to normal in size, with a smooth contour.
Simple cysts typically appear in fewer numbers than acquired cysts.

TREATMENT
Acquired cysts are generally asymptomatic and require no specific
treatment.
Cyst hemorrhage is typically a self-limited process and can be managed
with bed rest, hydration, and analgesia, as well as avoiding heparin on
dialysis.
Severe bleeding episodes are unusual, but may require embolization or
nephrectomy.
Patients with a suspicious lesion on CT/MRI that is >3 cm in diameter
should undergo nephrectomy.

PROGNOSIS
Approximately 2% to 7% of patients with acquired cystic disease will
have transformation to renal cell carcinoma.
Screening may be useful for patients with an anticipated life expectancy
longer than the average patient on dialysis.

MEDULLARY CYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE
447

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Classification
MCKD is a complex of disorders manifesting as cyst development at the
corticomedullary junction; progression with interstitial fibrosis typically
leads to end-stage renal disease.
Nephronophthisis is a childhood disorder usually diagnosed by age 15; it
is an autosomal recessive disorder.
The adult forms of MCKD have an autosomal dominant inheritance, with
MCKD1 (chromosome 1) and MCKD2 (chromosome 16) from two distinct
genetic loci.
Epidemiology
All forms of MCKD are rare.
Although juvenile nephronophthisis has an incidence of 1 in 1,000,000, it
is the most common genetic cause of end-stage renal disease under the
age of 20.
There is no racial or gender predilection for MCKD.
Pathophysiology
The gene products of MCKD appear to localize to the primary cilia in the
nephron.
As in ADPKD, there may be a defect in flow-mediated sensation or cell–
cell interaction that results in cell proliferation and cyst formation.9
Cysts form at the corticomedullary junction and arise late in the course of
disease; they are not absolutely necessary for diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
448

Patients with the adult forms typically present in the third and fourth
decades of life.
A family history is common given the autosomal dominant inheritance
pattern, but sporadic mutation can occur.
A concentrating defect in the kidney may be pronounced, with severe
sodium wasting.
Other defects of the distal nephron are common, such as impaired H+
excretion leading to a distal renal tubular acidosis (type 1 RTA).
Diagnostic Criteria
CT scans may detect numerous small cysts at the corticomedullary
junction, with sizes ranging from <0.5 to 2 cm in diameter.
Ultrasonography can also be used to detect the larger cysts, showing
small-to-normal–sized kidneys with smooth outlines.
Differential Diagnosis
Unlike ADPKD, the kidneys in MCKD are smooth and not enlarged,
whereas the cysts, when present, are confined to the corticomedullary
junction or renal medulla.
Also, extrarenal cysts are not common in MCKD.

TREATMENT
As no specific therapy is available for MCKD, treatment is generally
supportive.
Maintenance of an adequate fluid volume is important to replace
urinary salt and water losses.

PROGNOSIS
Progression to end-stage renal disease is the typical pattern for
449

MCKD.
MCKD1 has a more rapid progression, with a median age of 62 years for
end-stage renal disease versus 32 years for MCKD2.

MEDULLARY SPONGE KIDNEY
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
MSK is a developmental disorder with cystic dilation of the distal
nephron (collecting ducts within the medullary pyramids).
It is not believed to be a genetically inherited disorder.
Incidence is 1 in 5000 live births with no racial or gender predilection,
although many more cases are probably undiagnosed.
Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis is unknown.
Only the inner papillary portions of the medulla are affected with cystic
dilation, ranging from 1 to 7 mm in size.
Most cysts communicate directly with the collecting system.
Abnormalities of distal tubular function are common and account for the
typical complications of MSK.
Defects in urinary concentration may result from impaired vasopressin
response (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus).
Impaired H+ excretion results in a distal renal tubular acidosis (type I
RTA), and the accompanying hypocitraturia and increased calcium
filtration can lead to nephrolithiasis.
Urinary stasis within the cysts predisposes to infection, pyelonephritis,
450

and abscess formation.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Patients are typically asymptomatic and the abnormality is frequently
picked up on imaging for another cause.
Complications of the disease, such as nephrolithiasis or recurrent urinary
tract infections, can bring these patients to medical attention.
Gross hematuria can occur in up to 20% of patients, either in isolation
or in association with a renal stone or infection.
Renal function is typically normal, and deterioration is not seen as long
as the stone and infectious complications are appropriately managed.
Diagnostic Criteria
The gold standard for making the diagnosis of MSK is intravenous
excretory pyelography.
Dilated collecting ducts appear as linear striations, causing a classic
“paintbrush” effect.
Ectatic areas appear as “bouquets of flowers” or as “bunches of grapes.”
Ultrasonography is generally unable to identify the small cysts.
Differential Diagnosis
Like with MSK, MCKD also involves the deeper portions of the kidney;
however, renal dysfunction and a family history are typically absent in
MSK.
MSK can usually be distinguished from ADPKD by the smaller size of the
cysts, normal renal function, and absence of a family history.

451

TREATMENT
Patients with MSK should be encouraged to maintain adequate fluid
intake to avoid urinary stasis and reduce stone formation.
Close vigilance and early eradication of urinary tract infections can
reduce infectious complications.
Persistent hematuria, particularly in patients >50 years of age, should
prompt an evaluation for malignancy or other causes.
Acid–base balance should be monitored and persistent metabolic
acidosis treated in order to protect long-term bone health.

PROGNOSIS
As MSK is a developmental disorder and not a progressive one, longterm prognosis is excellent.
Overall patient health is determined by correction of disease
complications and not the renal malformations themselves.

TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
Tuberous sclerosis is an inherited disease complex, involving benign
growths in the kidneys (angiomyolipomas), brain, retina, lungs, and soft
tissues.
Two distinct types are defined genetically: TSC1 on chromosome 9
(hamartin) and TSC2 on chromosome 16 (tuberin), with autosomal
dominant transmission.
Incidence is estimated at 1 in 6000 to 10,000 live births, affecting all
races and ethnicities.
452

The genetic locus for TSC2 is adjacent to the locus for PKD1, and thus
∼2% of patients with TSC2 will also have PKD1 (with a more severe
renal phenotype and earlier progression).
Pathophysiology
The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 are tumor suppressors acting on the
mTOR (Mammalian target of rapamycin) complex.
Hamartomas, angiomyolipomas, and renal cysts develop from unopposed
cell proliferation.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Extrarenal manifestations are most characteristic, with hamartomas in
the brain, retina, soft tissue, and lungs; a history of epilepsy is common.
The kidneys typically develop angiomyolipomas, which can lead to
hematuria.
Although cyst formation occurs in only 20% to 30% of patients, they can
be quite large in size.
Renal dysfunction is uncommon and development of renal cell carcinoma
is rare, but the risk is elevated as compared to the general population.
Symptoms tend to be more severe with mutations in TSC2 as compared to
TSC1.
Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnosis rests on the typically clinical extrarenal manifestations; major
and minor criteria have been defined (Table 21-3).10
Renal angiomyolipomas constitute a major criterion; whereas renal
cysts make up a minor criterion.
453

Ultrasonography can define the cystic structures, but angiomyolipomas
may be better evaluated with CT scanning or MRI.
Genetic tests for TSC1 and TSC2 have been available since 2002,
although they have a significant false-negative rate.
Differential Diagnosis
The presence of fat in the renal lesions, as detected on imaging, can help
identify them as angiomyolipomas.
Yearly CT/MRI follow-up of known lesions should be undertaken to
determine if suspicious growth patterns develop.

TREATMENT
Management is primarily centered on the neurological
manifestations, with antiepileptic medications to treat seizures.

454

Given the implication of an overactive mTOR pathway, studies using the
mTOR inhibitors, sirolimus and everolimus, have shown promise,
particularly for neurological manifestations.11
Renal disease is not typically progressive and thus requires no specific
treatment.
Yearly imaging can identify suspicious changes for renal cell carcinoma.

VON HIPPEL–LINDAU SYNDROME
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Epidemiology
The VHL syndrome is an inherited disease complex of cerebellar and
retinal hemangioblastomas, adrenal pheochromocytomas (up to 20%),
renal/pancreatic cysts and carcinomas (40% incidence).
Inheritance is autosomal dominant with the genetic abnormality on
chromosome 3.
The incidence of this disease is ∼1 in 35,000.
Pathophysiology
The precise nature of the underlying tumor and cyst development has not
been fully elucidated.
Studies have implicated uncontrolled angiogenesis, through abnormal
regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors, mTOR overactivity, and
microtubular abnormalities during cell division.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The VHL syndrome can present with malignancies of the kidney,
455

pancreas, adrenal glands (pheochromocytoma), or brain and retina
(hemangioblastoma).
Neurologic symptoms depend on the local expansion of the
nonmetastatic cerebellar hemangioblastomas.
Renal cysts may be large and plentiful, simulating ADPKD with renal
dysfunction.
Malignant tumors generally arise separately from the cysts, although
renal cysts can show evidence of epithelial dysplasia and progress to
solid malignant lesions.
Not all mutations confer the same risk for developing renal cell
carcinoma; mutations that result in the production of truncated proteins
are associated with a higher risk of developing this malignancy, and thus
tends to cluster within families.12
Diagnostic Criteria
CT scans are preferred over ultrasonography, given their ability to
identify smaller lesions.
However, ultrasonography can be helpful in distinguishing cystic lesions
from solid masses.
Genetic testing is available for VHL and can determine the need for
cancer screening in at-risk relatives.
Differential Diagnosis
VHL may be difficult to distinguish from ADPKD when a family history is
absent and the cysts are large and numerous; extrarenal manifestations
can be helpful in separating these diseases.
A high index of suspicion is necessary when evaluating a patient with
cysts but without a family history of a cystic syndrome.

TREATMENT
456

Imaging of renal lesions with CT scanning every 6 months to 1 year is
recommended.
Suspicious enlarging solid lesions should undergo nephron-sparing
surgical removal.

Renal Diseases in Pregnancy
Sindhu Garg and Tingting Li

General Principles
Pregnancy is associated with predictable anatomic changes of the kidney
and is characterized by physiologic changes of systemic and renal
hemodynamics.
Hypertension and proteinuria should be considered pathologic, and the
presence of these findings must lead to consideration of preeclampsia as
well as other conditions.
Women with mild kidney disease have a slightly higher risk of maternal
and fetal complications, but their pregnancies are generally successful.
More advanced kidney disease is associated with lower fertility rates and
worse maternal and fetal outcomes.
Normal Anatomic Renal Changes in Pregnancy
Kidney size increases by 1.0 to 1.5 cm in pregnancy. Kidney volume
increases by 30% due to increased renal blood flow and increased
interstitial volume.1
Renal histology and nephron numbers are unchanged.1
Dilation of the ureters (hydroureter) and renal pelvis/calyces
(hydronephrosis) occurs due to the smooth muscle relaxing effect of
progesterone, causing reduced ureteral tone and peristalsis. These are
physiologic findings and occur in ∼80% of pregnant women, more
prominent on the right side.2

459

Extrinsic compression of the ureters by the gravid uterus may cause
mechanical obstruction as the pregnancy progresses, but this is usually
of no clinical significance.
The dilated collecting system can result in urinary stasis, leading to an
increased risk for ascending infection of the urinary tract.
Normal Hemodynamic Changes in Pregnancy
Systemic hemodynamics3:
There is reduction in systemic vascular resistance in early pregnancy,
leading to a drop in mean arterial blood pressure by 10 mm Hg by the
second trimester.
The reduced systemic vascular resistance leads to increased sympathetic
activity, resulting in 15% to 20% increase in heart rate.
Cardiac output increased by 30% to 50% due to increased heart rate and
stroke volume, and reduced after load.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is activated, leading to increased
sodium and water reabsorption, resulting in retention of up to 900
mEq of extra sodium during the entire pregnancy and increase of total
body water by 6 to 8 L. As a result, physiologic anemia and edema are
common during normal pregnancy.

Renal hemodynamics:
460

Renal vascular resistance decreases during early pregnancy due to
incompletely understood mechanisms, leading to a significant increase
in renal blood flow.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases during early pregnancy by
50% because of both increased renal blood flow and increased cardiac
output.4
The increase in GFR results in a decrease in serum creatinine (from 0.8
mg/dL to 0.4 to 0.5 mg/dL), serum blood urea nitrogen (from 13 mg/dL
to 8 to 10 mg/dL), and serum uric acid levels (from 4 mg/dL to 2 to 3
mg/dL) (see Table 22-1).
It is important to remember that serum creatinine that is considered
normal in a non-pregnant female might actually signify significant
renal impairment in a pregnant patient.
Changes in Water Homeostasis
Mild, asymptomatic hyponatremia is due to downward resetting of
osmotic threshold for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and thirst
(frequently known as the “reset osmostat”). This leads to a new steadystate plasma osmolality of 270 to 275 mOsm/kg and fall in serum sodium
level by 5 mEq/L.5 Reset osmostat is thought to be mediated by human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
During the second half of pregnancy, high levels of placental
vasopressinase can lead to increased ADH catabolism. Rarely, diabetes
insipidus (DI) can ensue but is usually transient.6
DI in pregnancy can be treated with desmopressin, a vasopressin analog
that is resistant to the actions of vasopressinase.
Acid–Base Regulation
In pregnancy, there is increase in minute ventilation and mild chronic
respiratory alkalosis (PCO2 falls to 30 mm Hg, pH increases to 7.44,
and serum bicarbonate level decreases to 20 to 22 mEq/L because of
461

compensatory increase in renal bicarbonate excretion). This can occur
even in the first trimester, as progesterone directly stimulates central
respiratory receptors.7
Other Renal Changes
Urinary protein excretion increases during pregnancy, up to 200 mg
per 24 hours. Proteinuria of >300 mg per 24 hours is pathologic.
Owing to increased filtered load of glucose and amino acids, as well as
less efficient tubular reabsorption, pregnant women may have mild
glycosuria and aminoaciduria.3

HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS IN PREGNANCY
Definition
Absolute blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg, taken on two separate
occasions
6 hours apart, is considered abnormal.
Classification
Chronic hypertension (or preexisting hypertension)8:
Hypertension diagnosed prior to 20th week of gestation, or persisting
longer than 12 weeks postpartum
Gestational hypertension:
De novo hypertension occurring after 20th week of gestation and
resolving within 12 weeks postpartum
Preeclampsia:
New onset hypertension and proteinuria (>300 mg per 24 hours)
occurring after 20th week of gestation
Diagnosis is changed to eclampsia with development of seizures
462

Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension
Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy
Chronic hypertension occurs in 3% to 5% of all pregnancies3 and
contributes significantly to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.
Pregnancies complicated by hypertension have an increased risk of
preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, placental abruption,
preterm delivery, and fetal loss.
Chronic hypertension can be masked in early pregnancy because of the
physiologic decrease in blood pressure.
Tight blood pressure control does not improve neonatal outcome or
prevent superimposed preeclampsia and can compromise fetal
growth because of decreased placental perfusion.9
Target blood pressure is ill-defined. Most experts recommend a goal of
140 to 150/90 mm Hg.
Management (see Table 22-2):
Pharmacological treatment is recommended when blood pressure is
>150/100 mm Hg to prevent maternal end-organ damage.10
Severe hypertension (≥170/110 mm Hg) can be managed using
intravenous labetalol, hydralazine, or nicardipine, as these have been
extensively used during pregnancy.
Oral agents that are used to treat elevated blood pressure in pregnancy
include methyldopa, labetalol, long-acting nifedipine, and hydralazine.
Diuretics are generally not recommended during pregnancy because of
risk of volume depletion in the fetus.

463

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) are CONTRAINDICATED because of
extremely high risk of teratogenicity. Other inhibitors of the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone axis also fall into this category.
Preeclampsia
Epidemiology
Preeclampsia affects ∼5% of all pregnancies and remains the leading
cause of maternal and fetal mortality in the world.11
Risk factors for preeclampsia are listed in Table 22-3.
Pathophysiology
Initiating events in preeclampsia are poorly understood, but the origin
appears to be the placenta and the target is the maternal endothelium.
In normal pregnancy, cytotrophoblasts invade the uterine spiral
arterioles, converting them from small-caliber vessels to large-caliber
capacitance vessels capable of carrying larger amount of blood flow
through the placenta.
In preeclampsia, this process of cytotrophoblast invasion is defective and
there is deficient transformation of the spiral arterioles, leading to
reduced placental perfusion.12
464

The diseased placenta secretes an increased amount of antiangiogenic
factor (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1), which antagonizes the
proangiogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor and placental
growth factor, resulting in systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction
characteristic of preeclampsia.13
Maternal endothelial dysfunction causes increased production of reactive
oxygen species, thromboxane, and endothelin-1. Also, there is increased
vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II and decreased nitric oxide and
prostacyclin bioavailability.13
The end result is potent vasoconstriction and end-organ damage.
Clinical Presentation
Symptom onset is usually in the latter part of the third trimester, but can
happen anytime after 20th week of gestation, or can be delayed until
after delivery.
Clinical features of preeclampsia are detailed in Table 22-4.
Signs and laboratory findings in severe preeclampsia are8,14:
Blood pressure ≥160/110 mm Hg
Proteinuria ≥5g per 24 hours or 3+ protein on urine dipstick results
Oliguria <500 mL urine in 24 hours or elevated serum creatinine
Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome
Pulmonary edema, impaired liver function
465

Headaches, visual disturbances, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain
Fetal growth restriction
Treatment
Definitive treatment is delivery. Gestational age, severity of
preeclampsia, and maternal and fetal condition are all important factors
when deciding the appropriate course of action.

Indications for urgent delivery8:
Greater than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation
Refractory hypertension despite adequate therapy
Progressive organ system failure (kidney, liver, hematologic parameters,
neurological dysfunction)
Eclampsia
HELLP syndrome
Fetal compromise
466

Abruptio placentae
Management of hypertension:
The goal of treatment is prevention of cerebrovascular and
cardiovascular events.
Treatment does not change the course of preeclampsia and does not
prevent progression to eclampsia.
Aggressive lowering of blood pressure in patients with preeclampsia is
NOT recommended, as it can further decrease placental perfusion and
compromise fetal growth.
The blood pressure level at which treatment should begin is undefined.
In general, most experts initiate therapy with blood pressure at ≥150
to 160/100 to 110 mm Hg. Target blood pressure is usually 140 to
150/90 mm Hg.
Please refer to Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy for recommendations
on antihypertensive therapy.
Mild preeclampsia management:
Supportive therapy until delivery
Complete or partial bed rest
Frequent fetal monitoring
Blood pressure check twice weekly
Laboratory tests: hemoglobin and hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine,
hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase,
lactate dehydrogenase), uric acid, urine dipstick test.
Severe preeclampsia management includes:
Immediate hospitalization
467

Seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate
Corticosteroids between 25 and 34 weeks to decrease the risk of
respiratory distress syndrome in infants
Acute management of severe hypertension with intravenous labetalol,
hydralazine, or nicardipine to a target blood pressure of 140 to 150/90
mm Hg
Delivery of fetus

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY IN PREGNANCY
Pregnant patients are susceptible to a variety of causes of acute kidney
injury (AKI), including disorders that are pregnancy specific.
Causes of AKI in Pregnancy
Prerenal Azotemia
Hyperemesis gravidarum
Other prerenal causes
Acute Tubular Necrosis
Hyperemesis gravidarum
Hemorrhage
Shock/sepsis (e.g., septic abortion, pyelonephritis)
Obstructive Uropathy
Gravid uterus (rare)
Large uterine fibroids
Stones:
468

These are usually calcium containing as urinary calcium excretion
increases in pregnancy.
They are often located in the distal ureter.
Most stones tend to pass spontaneously.
Ureteral stents can be placed in patients unable to pass the stone;
percutaneous nephrostomy may be required to decompress the urinary
system.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is not recommended during
pregnancy.
Obstructive stones with hydronephrosis/pyonephrosis may require
cystoscopic or ureteroscopic stone removal.15
Risk of infection is increased.
Acute Pyelonephritis
Risk factors16:
Urinary stasis due to physiologic hydroureter and hydronephrosis
increases risk for upper tract infection.
Anatomic displacement of ureters by the gravid uterus can also lead to
stasis and obstruction, thus increasing risk for pyelonephritis.
Untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria is a well-known risk factor for
urinary tract infections. This is defined by the presence of positive urine
culture in an asymptomatic person: ≥105 colony-forming units per mL in
voided urine on two separate collections or ≥102 colony-forming units
per mL in a catheterized specimen. It increases risk for adverse fetal
outcomes, and routine screen at 12 to 16 weeks is recommended.
Treatment is always warranted for asymptomatic bacteriuria.
Clinical presentation:
469

Fever, dysuria, flank pain
Can lead to sepsis and shock
AKI can result from focal microabscesses and sepsis/shock
Treatment:
Aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics and supportive
measures
Renal Cortical Necrosis
Renal cortical necrosis is secondary to rare catastrophic events resulting
in prolonged hypotension and profound renal ischemia, especially to the
renal cortex.17,18 The damage is irreversible in most cases, with
survivors often requiring long-term dialysis. The well-described causes for
renal cortical necrosis are listed below.
Causes:
Septic abortion
Amniotic fluid embolism
Fetal demise with retained fetus
Abruptio placentae
The precipitating event usually leads to disseminated intravascular
coagulation and severe renal ischemia.
Clinical presentation includes:
Abrupt onset of oliguria/anuria
Flank pain
Gross hematuria
470

Hypotension (±)
Diagnosis:
Ultrasound or computed tomography scan shows hypoechoic or
hypodense areas in the renal cortex.
Renal biopsy is not routinely done.
Treatment:
Supportive measures only as there is no effective therapy.
A total of 20% to 40% patients initially require renal replacement
therapy.
Partial renal recovery can occur, but may take months.
Preeclampsia/HELLP Syndrome
This is a rare cause of AKI, and has been explained in detailed under
preeclampsia.
Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy
This is extremely rare but can be fatal.18
Fatty liver of pregnancy typically presents in the third trimester.
It is extremely important to distinguish from HELLP syndrome and
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (Table 22-5).
Clinical features include:
Anorexia
Jaundice

471

Nausea and vomiting
Abdominal pain
AKI: the mechanism is unclear and renal pathology is usually
unremarkable.
Etiology:
There is extensive microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes due to
defective mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The trigger for this is
unknown.
Laboratory data:
Elevated transaminases
Increased bilirubin/ammonia level
Prolongation of PTT and PT
Thrombocytopenia (not prominent)
Hypoglycemia
472

Treatment:
Prompt delivery and supportive care
Most patients fully recover, but some may require liver transplantation
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
HUS usually presents in the near term or in the immediate postpartum
period, but can occur at any stage of pregnancy.
Clinical features:
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
Thrombocytopenia
AKI: thrombotic microangiopathy is noted on renal pathology
Hypertension
Treatment:
Plasma exchange is the primary treatment.
Delivery does not appear to change the course of the disease.

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND PREGNANCY
Fertility is diminished in women with chronic kidney disease
(CKD), especially in those with serum creatinine >3.0 mg/dL or who are
dialysis dependent. CKD leads to impairment in the hypothalamic–
pituitary–gonadal axis, causing decreased fertility.19
If patients with CKD (regardless of underlying etiology) become
pregnant, they are at increased risk for adverse maternal and fetal
outcomes.19
Maternal complications:
473

Increased proteinuria
Worsening hypertension
Increased risk for preeclampsia
Permanently diminished renal function
Fetal complications:
Prematurity
Intrauterine growth retardation
Increased risk for fetal loss
This risk depends on the severity of baseline renal dysfunction, presence
of uncontrolled hypertension, and degree of proteinuria.20,21
Women with preexisting mild CKD (creatinine <1.4 mg/dL), normal
blood pressure, and no proteinuria generally have good maternal and
fetal outcomes.
Patients with moderate (creatinine 1.4 to 2.5 mg/dL) or severe
(creatinine >2.5 mg/dL) CKD have significantly increased risk of
developing worsening renal function, proteinuria, hypertension, as well
as increased rates of fetal complications.22,23
In one study, the combined presence of GFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2
(CKD stage 3) and proteinuria >1 g/d before conception predicted
faster GFR loss after delivery, shorter time to dialysis, and low birth
weight.24
Necessary discontinuation of certain medications (ACE inhibitor, ARB, or
certain immunosuppressants) may lead to renal exacerbation or disease
flare.
Women of reproductive age with CKD should be advised of the potential
adverse maternal and fetal effects related to pregnancy.
474

Pregnancy in the Dialysis Patient
Conception in dialysis patients is very rare (only 0.3% to 1.5% of all
women of childbearing age).20
Early pregnancy is difficult to diagnose as β-HCG is not reliable.20
Outcomes are similar in patients treated with hemodialysis and
peritoneal dialysis.25
Fetal:
High spontaneous fetal loss (50%)
Premature labor (86%)
Fetal growth retardation (30%)
Maternal:
Severe hypertension (85%)
Increased mortality rate
Management26,27:
Hemodialysis:
Longer and more frequent dialysis sessions can improve fetal
outcome (>20 h/wk).
It is important to avoid hypotension, hypocalcemia, and metabolic
acidosis.
Peritoneal dialysis:
Decreased fill volume and frequent exchanges might be beneficial.
Anemia:
475

Hemoglobin should be maintained above 10 g/dL.
Iron and folic acid supplementation should be administered.
Erythropoietin should be prescribed cautiously given risk of
hypertension, but there does not appear to be a risk for teratogenicity.
Nutrition:
Protein intake should be ∼1.8 g/kg/d and supplemented with vitamins.
Blood pressure control:
Diuretics do not have a significant role in a dialysis patient and should
be used with caution in a non-dialysis CKD patient.
ACE inhibitors and ARBs are CONTRAINDICATED in pregnancy.
Obstetric care:
High-risk obstetric care and serial fetal monitoring during hemodialysis
is recommended.
Pregnancy after Renal Transplant
Return of fertility is the rule in female transplant patients of childbearing
age, occurring as early as 1 month following renal transplantation.28
Patients are advised to wait for at least 1 year and preferably 2 years
following renal transplantation before conception.
Prior to conception:
The pregnancy should be planned and the patient should discuss with
treating nephrologist prior to conception.
Renal function should be stable with serum creatinine <1.5 mg/dL.
Proteinuria should be <500 mg/d.
476

Blood pressure should be controlled with minimal number of
medications.
There should be no recent episodes of rejection or other transplantrelated complications.
Mycophenolate, sirolimus, statins, ACE inhibitor, and ARB should
be discontinued prior to pregnancy.
It is important to change these medications to others that are considered
“safe” in pregnancy ahead of time and to ensure that the serum
creatinine and blood pressure are stable, before conception.
Azathioprine, calcineurin inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers may
be continued during pregnancy.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Pregnancy
Best pregnancy outcomes occur in women with quiescent lupus for at
least
6 months prior to conception.29
Pregnancy in women with active lupus nephritis is associated with an
increased risk of fetal loss (up to 75%) and worsening of both renal
and extrarenal manifestations.30
Women with severe active disease or a high degree of irreversible organ
damage, such as symptomatic pulmonary hypertension, heart failure,
severe restrictive pulmonary disease, or advanced chronic kidney
disease/lupus nephritis, should avoid pregnancy.31
Maintenance therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus or lupus nephritis
should be continued during pregnancy to prevent flares, although the
choice of therapy is frequently limited by teratogenicity.
When renal function or proteinuria worsens, low complement levels,
rising double stranded DNA antibody levels, and active urine sediment
could help differentiate lupus nephritis from preeclampsia.32

presence of antiphospholipid antibody.
The presence of SSA/SSB antibodies is a risk factor for neonatal
heart block.

Nephrolithiasis

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Kidney stones are crystalline structures in the urinary tract that have
achieved sufficient size to cause symptoms or be visible by radiographic
imaging techniques.
Most kidney stones in Western countries are composed of calcium salts
and occur in the upper urinary tract. Conversely, in developing countries,
the majority of stones are composed of uric acid and occur in the urinary
bladder.
It is believed that a protein-rich Western diet and lifestyle is responsible
for this difference. The economic impact of kidney stones relates to
surgical extraction or fragmentation of stones, loss of productivity, and
need for preventive treatment.
Stone formation is associated with increased risk of chronic kidney
disease.1
Classification
Chemical composition of stones can be determined in specialized
laboratories. On the basis of chemical composition, urinary stones can be
classified in the following manner:
Stones composed of calcium salts: In Western societies, 80% of all
kidney stones are composed of calcium salts. Of these, 35% are composed
exclusively of calcium oxalate; 40% are mixed (i.e., composed of calcium
oxalate and calcium phosphate), whereas 5% of stones are composed
exclusively of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite or brushite).
481

Uric acid stones and struvite stones: These form roughly 10% to 20%
of all stones in the urinary tract. Uric acid stones are radiolucent.
Cystine stones: The hereditary disorder cystinuria (not to be confused
with cystinosis) accounts for ∼1% of all cases. Cystinuria is characterized
by an amino acid transport defect in the proximal renal tubule, resulting
in a urinary loss of dibasic amino acids (Fig. 23-1).
Other: Rarely, stones can be formed by poorly soluble drugs (e.g.,
triamterene, indinavir), xanthine, hypoxanthine, or ammonium urate.
Epidemiology
Nephrolithiasis is one of the most common diseases in Western countries.
In the United States, the prevalence of nephrolithiasis has increased over
the years. Whites are affected more frequently than blacks, Hispanics, or
Asian Americans. Prevalence is influenced by age, sex, race, body size,
and geographic distribution.2
The peak age of onset is the third decade, with increasing prevalence
until the age of 70 years. In women, there is a second peak at the age of
55 years.2,3

FIGURE 23-1. Schematic representation of the dibasic amino acid
(AA) transport in the proximal renal tubule. Cystinuria results
from a defect in the dibasic AA transporter on the apical side of the
membrane. Hence, cystinuria is also attended by elevated urinary
excretion of lysine (Lys), arginine (Arg), and ornithine (Orn). CAT,

482

CE, Brenner BM. Molecular basis of inherited disorders of renal
solute transport. Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens. 1997;6:411–421.)
Historically, men have had a two to three times greater risk than women.
More recently, an increasing rate of nephrolithiasis in females has been
attributed to more obesity. Larger body mass index (BMI) is associated
with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis.4
Lifetime risk of developing a kidney stone is ∼12% for men and 6% for
women.
The southeastern states have the highest incidence of nephrolithiasis,
which is attributed to higher average temperatures and greater sun
exposure, resulting in oversaturation of stone-forming salts in the urine.
Pathophysiology
One can infer from the variety of stones observed that several
pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for stone formation.
Nevertheless, a common pathway leading to stone formation is urinary
supersaturation. Crystals form when the amount of solute in the urine
exceeds its solubility limits.
Stone Formation
Three steps are necessary to form a stone:
1. Formation of a small initial crystal, or nidus.
2. Retention of a nidus in the urinary tract. If washed away by urine flow,
crystal formation would remain a mere physiologic curiosity.
3. Growth of a nidus to a size at which it either becomes symptomatic or
visible by imaging techniques.
Solubility Product, Formation Product, and Nucleation
Solubility product: Solubility product describes the level of a solution’s
saturation with solute at which solid-phase material exists in
483

equilibrium with liquid-phase material. For a calcium oxalate crystal
immersed in a calcium oxalate solution, the solubility product describes a
concentration of calcium and oxalate that does not allow the crystal to
dissolve. At the same time, the product is too low to permit crystal
growth; the size of the calcium oxalate crystal remains unchanged.
Concentrations lower than solubility products are undersaturated.
Concentrations higher than the solubility product are supersaturated.
Formation product:
Formation product is the level of supersaturation at which a solute
can no longer remain in a solution and precipitates out
spontaneously (homogeneous nucleation).
Nucleation can take place at a lower level of supersaturation if a solid
phase is already present (heterogeneous nucleation). Even normal
urine is often supersaturated with calcium oxalate. Urinary calcium
oxalate product can exceed its solubility by three to four times. Calcium
oxalate crystalluria occurs in both stone formers and nonstone formers.
Studies suggest that calcium oxalate crystal formation occurs by
heterogeneous nucleation. Potential nucleating agents are calcium
phosphate crystals, uric acid crystals, and cellular debris. Indeed, calcium
phosphate is commonly present in stones composed primarily of calcium
oxalate. By a similar mechanism of heterogeneous nucleation,
hyperuricosuria contributes to calcium oxalate stone formation.
Urinary saturation: Urinary saturation levels are influenced by the
amount of solute and urine volume. The importance of the absolute
amount of solute and urine volume is obvious: The more the solute is
excreted in a lower volume, the higher the levels of saturation achieved.
Urine pH: Urinary pH has a variable effect depending on the solutes
involved.
Low urine pH significantly lowers the solubility of uric acid. This
effect is a result of different solubilities of the protonated and dissociated
forms of uric acid. Solubility of the undissociated form in acidic urine is
very poor. Low urine pH makes uric acid supersaturation easy to achieve,
484

even at normal uric acid excretion rates of 600 to 800 mg/d (3.6 to 4.8
mM/d). Uric acid crystals not only form into uric acid stones but also can
nucleate out calcium oxalate (heterogeneous nucleation). Hence, low
urine pH is a risk factor for uric acid and calcium oxalate stones.
Alkaline urine pH predisposes to the formation of crystals
containing phosphates: calcium phosphate and struvite (ammonium
magnesium phosphate) stones.
Calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis is most commonly observed in
patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), a condition leading to a
persistently high urine pH.
Struvite stones form in the presence of a urinary tract infection (UTI)
caused by urease-producing bacteria. Urease-producing bacteria split
abundant urinary urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia
alkalinizes the urine and, together with magnesium, combines with
phosphate to form struvite crystals.
Amount of inhibitors of crystallization:
Citrate, the main inhibitor of crystallization of calcium salts, complexes
with calcium to form a soluble calcium citrate compound. By doing so, it
makes calcium unavailable to precipitate out as calcium oxalate or
calcium phosphate. Hypocitraturia is a common finding among calcium
stone formers.
Magnesium also inhibits crystallization of calcium salts, although its
effect is not as important as that of citrate.
Risk Factors
Risk Factors for Calcium Oxalate and Calcium Phosphate
Nephrolithiasis
Hypercalciuria: Hypercalciuria is the most common metabolic
derangement among stone formers. The amount of calcium excreted in
the urine varies with body size and dietary calcium intake. The upper
limit of normal calcium excretion in the urine is 4 mg/kg/d
485

(approximately 280 mg/d for men, 240 mg/d for women) for patients
consuming 1000 mg of elemental calcium. For patients consuming only
400 mg, the upper value becomes approximately 200 mg/d.
Hypercalciuria can be classified as either idiopathic or secondary to
hypercalcemia (Table 23-1).
Hypercalciuria due to hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia imposes an
increased filtered load of calcium and results in an overflow
hypercalciuria. The causes and approach to hypercalcemia are discussed
in Chapter 8.
Idiopathic hypercalciuria:
Idiopathic hypercalciuria, by definition, is not a consequence of
hypercalcemia. It is currently believed that most cases of idiopathic
hypercalciuria are caused by excessive calcium absorption from the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract (absorptive hypercalciuria). This disorder has a
strong familial component. The pathophysiology of this disorder is not
clear, but vitamin D receptor polymorphisms have been implicated.
The degree of hypercalciuria can also be influenced by dietary sodium
intake. Excessive sodium intake causes extracellular fluid volume
expansion and diminished sodium resorption along the nephron. Volume
expansion results not only in natriuresis but in calciuresis as well. Hence,
dietary salt restriction can be an effective method of lowering
hypercalciuria.
Thiazide diuretics reduce hypercalciuria predominantly through
reduction in extracellular fluid volume, leading to enhanced proximal and
distal reabsorption of calcium.5
Hyperoxaluria: Hyperoxaluria is divided into dietary, enteric, or
primary forms (Table 23-2).
Dietary hyperoxaluria: Normal daily urinary excretion of oxalate is
<40 mg/d.
Excessive dietary intake of oxalate-rich foods can result in a mild form of
dietary hyperoxaluria (urinary oxalate excretion of 50 to 60 mg/d).
486

Oxalate-rich foods include nuts, sunflower seeds, spinach, rhubarb,
chocolate, Swiss chard, lime peel, star fruit, peppers, and tea. Intake of
vitamin C exceeding 100 mg/d can cause hyperoxaluria.6

Enteric hyperoxaluria: Fat malabsorption and saponification of
calcium in the gut by free fatty acids result in increased colonic
absorption of oxalate. Detergent bile acids nonselectively increase the
permeability of colonic mucosa to a number of substances, including
oxalate. The resultant hyperoxaluria is more severe than the dietary
form. Urinary oxalate excretion often exceeds 100 mg/d. Thus, small
bowel resection, jejunal bypass surgery, and inflammatory bowel
disorders can lead to hyperoxaluria, calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, and
even chronic renal failure due to nephrocalcinosis. In addition to
487

hyperoxaluria, malabsorption has several other consequences that
predispose to stone formation, including:
Low urine volumes due to diarrheal loss of water
Low urine pH due to colonic loss of bicarbonate
Hypocitraturia due to chronic metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia
Hypomagnesemia due to magnesium malabsorption
Primary hyperoxaluria: Primary forms of hyperoxaluria result from
well-described metabolic defects. These are characterized by excessive
endogenous production of oxalate, resulting in profound hyperoxaluria
(135 to 270 mg/d). Stone formation often begins in childhood. Deposition
of calcium oxalate in the tubulointerstitial compartment of the kidneys
(renal oxalosis) often leads to progressive loss of renal function.
Deposition of calcium oxalate also occurs in the heart, bone, joints, eyes,
and other tissues. Two major defects are worth mentioning:
Type I primary hyperoxaluria is an autosomal-recessive disorder that
results from reduced activity of hepatic peroxisomal alanine glyoxylate
aminotransferase. This increases the availability of glyoxylate, which is
irreversibly converted to oxalic acid.
Type II primary hyperoxaluria is a much rarer form of the disease due
to D-glycerate dehydrogenase or glyoxylate reductase deficiency.5
Hypocitraturia:
Hypocitraturia is defined as a urinary citrate excretion <250 mg/d. It
is observed in ∼40% of patients with nephrolithiasis.
The presence of hypocitraturia should arouse suspicions of a disorder
associated with chronic metabolic acidosis, such as distal RTA or a GI
disorder. The eubicarbonatemic form of distal RTA should be suspected in
patients with persistently high urine pH but normal or near-normal
plasma bicarbonate concentrations. Such patients may develop overt
metabolic acidosis only when challenged with an acid load. Patients with
488

complete or incomplete distal RTA make stones composed predominantly
of calcium phosphate (apatite).
Hypocitraturia can also be seen in the setting of hypokalemia or with the
use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate.7
Hyperuricosuria: Hyperuricosuria is a common finding noted in 10% to
26% of calcium stone formers. The amount of uric acid in the urine is
determined by daily production of uric acid and is not necessarily
associated with hyperuricemia. Studies have demonstrated that
allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, significantly reduces the rate of
calcium oxalate stone recurrences. The benefits are attributed to a
decreased urinary excretion of uric acid.
Urinary proteins: Although a number of urinary proteins have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of calcium nephrolithiasis, their role
remains to be further elucidated. Uropontin and nephrocalcin both inhibit
crystal growth. Their role in nephrolithiasis is still not fully established.
Risk Factors for Uric Acid Nephrolithiasis
Uric acid is a product of purine metabolism and is primarily derived from
endogenous sources, with dietary purines generally providing little
substrate. Four abnormalities have been strongly associated with
uric acid stones: persistently low urine pH, hyperuricemia,
hyperuricosuria, and low urine volume.
Persistently low urine pH: The pKa of uric acid is 5.35. Hence, low

urine pH makes urinary saturation with uric acid easy to achieve even at
normal excretion rates of 600 to 800 mg/d (3.6 to 4.8 mM/d). Patients
with gout, obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome are at greater risk of
forming uric acid stones, presumably secondary to excretion of
abnormally acidic urine. A linear drop in urine pH with increase in BMI
has been demonstrated, which is thought to be the link between obesity
and risk of forming uric acid stones.
Hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria:
489

Hyperuricosuria can be secondary to an increased production of uric
acid with an increased burden of excretion; alternatively, it can result
from enhanced renal excretion of uric acid in the absence of
hyperuricemia.
Increased uric acid production can be either congenital or acquired.
Congenital causes of uric acid overproduction are typically diseases
of single-gene defects such as hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency and other similarly rare diseases.
Acquired uric acid overproduction is common in myeloproliferative
disorders, such as polycythemia vera, or after chemotherapy for certain
cancers resulting in large-scale cell death (tumor lysis syndrome).
Hyperuricosuria with normal uric acid levels can occur due to
uricosuric agents such as probenecid and high-dose salicylates. Other
commonly used medications have uricosuric effects. Several examples
include losartan (increases uric acid excretion by approximately 10%),
fenofibrate (increases uric acid excretion by 20% to 30%), and
atorvastatin.
Low urine volume: Low urine volume is not a specific risk factor for uric
acid nephrolithiasis, but increases the risk of all stone types by increasing
the urinary supersaturation, as mentioned above.
Risk Factors for Struvite Nephrolithiasis
Struvite stones are also referred to as magnesium ammonium
phosphate, triple phosphate, urease, or infection stones.
UTI: Struvite stones form only during a UTI caused by urease-producing
bacteria, such as Proteus species, Providencia species, Pseudomonas, and
Enterococcus. These bacteria cleave ammonia from urea, causing an
elevation of urinary pH >7.0. Abundant ammonium and magnesium
combine with phosphates to give rise to struvite stones. Sometimes,
calcium phosphate (apatite) may become incorporated into stones.8

490

Primary calcium stones: Mixed struvite and calcium stones can occur in
cases in which primary calcium stones cause a UTI by one of the ureasplitting organisms. Mixed struvite and calcium stones occur more often
in men with idiopathic hypercalciuria, in which calcium stones become
secondarily infected or when alkaline urine becomes supersaturated for
calcium phosphate.
Factors that predispose one to recurrent UTIs, such as urinary
retention, increase the likelihood of struvite stone formation (neurogenic
bladder, indwelling bladder catheters, ileal conduit, urethral stricture,
benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder and caliceal diverticuli, cystocele).
Patients with history of diabetes mellitus or laxative or analgesic
abuse are at increased risk for struvite stones.
Prevention
The first tenet of prevention of nephrolithiasis is maintenance of high
urine volume. Nephrolithiasis patients should achieve a daily urine
volume of ≥2.5 L.
High urine volumes lower urine saturation with all salts.9,10
There are several helpful hints to assist patients in increasing urine
volume.
They can be instructed to drink sufficient amounts of fluids to a point
that the urine appears clear. Patients may take metered quantities of
water throughout the day, including in the evenings, to avoid excessive
urinary concentration during the night. This is particularly important for
those patients who suffer from chronic diarrheal disorders resulting in
excessive fluid loss from the GI tract.
Adequate fluid intake is also very important for patients who
demonstrate significant hyperuricosuria, as urine can become easily
saturated with uric acid even at normal levels of uric acid excretion.
Having a low sodium, low protein, and normal calcium diet decreases the
formation of calcium stones. Low protein diet also decreases the
491

formation of uric acid stones, as meat is the major contributor for
purines. Additional therapies to prevent the recurrence of specific types
of stones are discussed under Treatment (Table 23-3).

Associated Conditions
Cystinuria is a hereditary disorder of dibasic amino acid transport in the
proximal renal tubule.
The defect rests in a common dibasic amino acid transporter located on
the apical membrane of the proximal tubular cell (Fig. 3-1). A genetic
defect of this transporter results in urinary wasting of the dibasic amino
acids cysteine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine.
Cystine is a poorly soluble disulfide of the amino acid cysteine. The
solubility of cystine is ∼300 mg/L (1.25 mmol/L).
Normal urinary cystine excretion is only 30 to 50 mg/d (0.12 to 0.21
mmol/d). Patients with cystinuria often excrete as much as 480 to 3600
mg/d (2 to 15 mmol/d), easily achieving urinary supersaturation status.
The other three dibasic amino acids are soluble, and their loss in the urine
is inconsequential.
Structural abnormalities in the kidney such as polycystic kidney
disease, horseshoe kidney, and ureteropelvic junction obstruction cause
492

more stasis of the urine and predispose to stone formation.11
Medullary sponge kidney, a radiologic diagnosis of dilated distal
collecting ducts seen on intravenous (IV) pyelogram, may reflect damage
to the collecting ducts by hypercalciuria, which also predisposes to the
formation of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of nephrolithiasis ranges from incidental
diagnosis of otherwise asymptomatic disease to presentation with severe
symptoms, such as abdominal or ank pain (renal colic), macroscopic or
microscopic hematuria, UTIs, or even renal failure resulting from
bilateral urinary tract obstruction.
Asymptomatic disease: Patients with nephrolithiasis may remain
asymptomatic for years. They usually become symptomatic if a calculus
or its fragments begin to move along the urinary tract or cause
obstruction. However, even chronic obstruction can be asymptomatic, but
may eventually result in a permanent loss of renal function.
Renal colic: In renal colic, the pain is usually abrupt in onset, colicky in
nature, and located in the flank area. It often loops around and radiates
down along the path of the affected ureter; sometimes, it migrates
anteriorly and inferiorly into the groin and testicles or labia majora.
Usually, hematuria, urinary frequency, urgency, nausea, and vomiting
accompany the pain.
Hematuria: Trauma to the urinary tract incited by passage of gravel or a
stone leads to hematuria. It may be gross or microscopic and can occur
even in completely asymptomatic patients.
History
When interviewing a patient with kidney stone, history of prior stones
and dietary history, occupational history, and family history of stones
493

and medicinal use, including supplements such as calcium and vitamin C,
should be asked. Clinicians should also identify various risk factors
such as in ammatory bowel diseases, bowel surgeries, recurrent
UTIs, conditions that predispose toward hypercalcemia, and so
forth.
Physical Examination

costovertebral tenderness over the affected area.

Differential Diagnosis
In its classic form, the clinical presentation of renal colic is quite
suggestive of the diagnosis. However, it is imperative to consider other
serious conditions that can masquerade as renal colic in the di erential
diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy, intestinal obstruction, acute appendicitis,
diverticulitis, and many other abdominal catastrophes have been
confused with renal colic. The presence of hematuria is suggestive of the
diagnosis but not conclusive proof; an imaging study is required to make
a positive diagnosis.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Urinalysis: The presence of hematuria is suggestive of nephrolithiasis,
but its presence is insufficient to make the diagnosis.
Urine microscopy: The appreciation of specific types of crystals in the
urine identifies the type of stone being formed and can guide subsequent
therapy. A review of the appearance of various crystals can be found in
Chapter 1, Art and Science of Urinalysis.
Serum chemistries: A basic chemistry panel should be checked to assess
renal function, as well as any disturbances in electrolyte or mineral
balance. Serum levels of calcium, magnesium, and uric acid can be
helpful in determining the underlying processes leading to stone
494

formation. An intact parathyroid hormone level and 1,25 (OH)2 D3 levels
should be assessed in patients with hypercalcemia.
Imaging
Plain abdominal radiograph:
Approximately 90% of renal stones are radiopaque and can be seen
on plain radiographs of the abdomen. However, the plain x-ray provides
no information concerning presence or absence of urinary obstruction,
and it may not add significant insight to the differential diagnosis of
acute abdominal pain. Thus, plain abdominal x-rays have limited use in
the evaluation of acute renal colic.
Radiographic appearance of stones: The radiographic appearance of
stones on a plain abdominal radiograph may help identify stone type and
guide further evaluation.
Calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate stones are radiodense.
Struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate), when complexed
with calcium carbonate or phosphate, are also visible as large, irregular
stones. They sometimes take the shape of the calyces and are referred to
as staghorn calculi.
A plain x-ray of the abdomen (kidneys, ureter, and bladder) may miss
radiolucent uric acid or poorly visible cystine stones.
Xanthine and hypoxanthine stones are also radiolucent, but occur very
rarely.
IV urography and CT scan: IV urography used to be the preferred test
of choice for evaluation of these patients. The application of helical
noncontrast CT has largely replaced it as the initial step in evaluation of
suspected renal colic. It allows nephrolithiasis to be excluded or
confirmed expeditiously and without administration of potentially
nephrotoxic radiocontrast material. The sensitivity and specificity of CT
scan is superior to IV urography.12,13
495

Renal ultrasound: Ultrasound is useful to rule out significant
hydronephrosis or hydroureter; however, it may not detect stones until
they are relatively large. At times, the exact site of obstruction may also
not be clearly delineated. Although the sensitivity of ultrasound for stones
is low compared to CT scan, it remains very useful for evaluation of
patients who cannot receive radiation, such as pregnant women.14

TREATMENT
Treatment of Renal Colic
The treatment of acute renal colic consists of pain management, relief of
obstruction, and control of infection, if present.
The bigger the size of the stone, it is less likely to pass
spontaneously.12,15,16
If the stone is <5 mm, conservative management is adequate, as 80% to
90% of these stones pass spontaneously. The urine must be strained to
retrieve the stone for analysis.
Stones 5 to 7 mm only pass spontaneously 50% of the time, and stones
>7 mm rarely pass spontaneously.
If the stone is <7 mm, there is no obstruction, the urine is sterile, and
the pain is controlled; conservative management is warranted.
Fluid replacement should be designed to obtain a urine output of 2.5 L/d
to assist with the passage of the stone.
If the stone is passed but the patient had evidence of hydronephrosis or
evidence of multiple stones, a follow-up imaging study, such as helical
CT, within 2 weeks, is warranted. For the acute treatment of renal colic
narcotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used.15
Treatment of Calcium-Containing Nephrolithiasis
Thiazide diuretics:
496

Thiazide diuretics have long been the mainstay in treatment of
idiopathic hypercalciuria, with metabolic abnormality noted with more
than half of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.
They lower urinary excretion of calcium by at least two mechanisms.
The main mechanism is contraction of the extracellular fluid volume. By
reducing the extracellular volume, thiazide diuretics increase proximal
reabsorption of calcium.
Thiazides also directly increase calcium reabsorption in the distal
nephron.
The effects of thiazide diuretics can be completely negated by high
dietary salt intake. Urinary sodium excretion of ≥120 mEq/d suggests
nonadherence to a low-sodium diet. If calcium excretion is not reduced,
compliance with thiazide treatment and sodium intake should be
questioned.
Hypokalemia and hypocitraturia may complicate long-term therapy
with thiazide diuretics and can be prevented by adding oral potassium
citrate. Sometimes, to enhance the effect of thiazides and conserve
potassium, amiloride may be added.
The optional treatment regimens that have been studied include:
chlorthalidone 12.5 to 25 mg every day to a maximum of 100 mg every
day; hydrochlorothiazide 25 to 50 mg bid; hydrochlorothiazide 50
mg with amiloride (Moduretic) half tablet bid.
Oral phosphate:
Patients with urinary phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia may
benefit from phosphate replacement therapy.
Neutral potassium phosphate (Neutraphos) divided into three to four
doses (total daily dose 1500 mg) can lower urinary calcium excretion in
some patients and as one study has shown, may be as effective as
thiazide diuretics. However, compliance is difficult to achieve due to the
frequent doses and side effects, such as diarrhea and bloating.
497

Citrate:
Citrate therapy is the principal intervention for a large number of
calcium stone formers. In particular, hypocitraturia often occurs in
patients with small bowel malabsorption syndromes and distal RTA. As
an added advantage, in these patients with chronic acidosis, citrate
serves as a source of alkali (citrate is metabolized in the liver to
bicarbonate).
Citrate is administered in divided doses throughout the day; the starting
dose is usually 10 mEq PO two or three times daily.
Administration of an excessive amount of citrate can result in a
persistently alkaline urinary pH, which may increase the risk of calcium
phosphate stone formation in some patients.
Dietary modifications:
Dietary hyperoxaluria is treated by dietary restriction of oxalate-rich
foods.
Treatment of the enteric form of hyperoxaluria should be directed
toward correction of metabolic derangements resulting in stone
formation and nephrocalcinosis. Thiazide diuretics are usually ineffective
because patients with small bowel malabsorption demonstrate
hypocalciuria.
Absorptive hyperoxaluria is most often treated with a dietary restriction
of oxalate-rich foods and administration of intestinal oxalate binders,
such as calcium carbonate, which form nonreabsorbable compounds in
the GI tract. If calcium carbonate is ineffective, bile sequestrants, such as
cholestyramine, could be added.
Management of type I primary hyperoxaluria:
Type I primary hyperoxaluria occasionally can respond to pyridoxine
supplements. However, no good medical treatment short of liver
transplantation exists.
498

Increasing urinary volume to 3 L/d is beneficial.
Liver transplantation restores the enzymatic defects responsible for the
disease.
Renal transplantation in patients who have developed end-stage renal
disease due to primary hyperoxaluria requires a special protocol to avoid
accelerated renal oxalosis in the allograft; the ideal approach is combined
liver and kidney transplantation.
Treatment of Uric Acid Nephrolithiasis
Treatment of uric acid nephrolithiasis is based on attempts to increase the
solubility of uric acid and to decrease its excretion.
All patients should maintain urine volume >2.5 L/d.
Dietary counseling about low purine and low protein intake is
paramount. Alkalinization of urine to a pH >6.5 markedly increases the
solubility of uric acid.17
Potassium citrate (10 to 20 mEq PO tid; maximum, 100 mEq/d) is the
preferred alkalinizing agent because, unlike sodium salts, it does not
augment urinary calcium excretion. However, urinary alkalinization
alone is rarely sufficient. It is very difficult to avoid temporary episodes
of urinary acidification throughout the entire day (e.g., during the night).
Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of
xanthine to uric acid, is well tolerated and very effective in reducing
urinary uric acid excretion. The benefits of allopurinol are attributed to
its ability to treat hyperuricosuria and reduce uric acid crystal-induced
nucleation of calcium oxalate. The dose of allopurinol should be adjusted
to achieve a target excretion of uric acid of <600 mg/d. The success of
the treatment should be monitored by repeated 24-hour urinary
collections for stone risk assessment.
Treatment of Struvite Stones
Surgical intervention is usually needed to remove struvite stones.
499

Referral to Urology is advised for an evaluation and stone removal.
A variety of procedures are available, including percutaneous
nephrolithotomy and/or shockwave lithotripsy. Open surgical removal
(kidney-splitting surgery) is no longer the treatment of choice for
staghorn struvite calculi, unless the patient’s body habitus or stone
burden precludes less-invasive techniques.
Once patients are free of stones, they benefit from antibiotic therapy
directed against the predominant urinary organism. Most patients with
residual stone fragments progress despite treatment with antibiotics.
Reducing the bacterial population with antibiotics often slows stone
growth, but stone resolution with antibiotics is unlikely.
Treatment of Cystine Stones
Preventive medical therapy is directed toward reducing urinary cystine
concentration below its solubility limits.
High fluid intake can prevent stones only in some patients with low
levels of cystine excretion.
Most patients require treatment with penicillamine, tiopronin, or
captopril. These drugs reduce urinary saturation with cystine by forming
soluble disulfides. However, side effects may limit their use.
Dietary restriction of the essential amino acid methionine, a cystine
precursor, is impractical.
Urinary alkalinization to a pH >7.5 increases cystine solubility.
However, persistently alkaline urine is difficult to attain.
Once formed, cystine stones often require surgical removal.
Surgical Management
Indications for expedient stone removal are complete obstruction,
UTI, urosepsis, worsening renal failure, or uncontrollable colic with
severe nausea and vomiting.15
500

Symptomatic stones for more than 4 weeks can cause complications such
as ureteral stricture.
Treatment modalities include extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy
(ESWL), percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCN), ureteroscopic removal,
surgery, and chemolysis. The selection of treatment modality is
determined by the size, composition, and anatomic location of the stone,
anatomy of the collecting system, health status, and patient preference.
Stones that are lodged in the proximal ureter above the iliac vessels,
which are less than 1 cm, are treated with ESWL.
For proximal ureteral stones greater than 1 cm, ureteroscopy with YAG
laser is superior to ESWL.
For distal ureteral stones, both ESWL and ureteroscopy have similar
stone-free rates.18
Brushite and cystine stones are less responsive to ESWL.
Stones that are >2 cm are usually treated with PCN.
Surgical intervention is preferred for large staghorn calculi.
Diet
Dietary intervention plays a cardinal role in the preventive treatment of
calcium nephrolithiasis.
Studies have shown that a low-protein, low-salt diet significantly
reduces nephrolithiasis recurrence rates in patients with idiopathic
hypercalciuria.19 Long-term dietary compliance with a low-protein, lowsalt diet has been shown to be superior to a low-calcium diet in
prevention of nephrolithiasis.
A low-calcium diet may increase the intestinal absorption of oxalate,
reducing the effectiveness of this therapy. Therefore, low-calcium diets
are not recommended. Diets containing 700 to 800 mg of calcium are
adequate for patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria.
501

Low-protein diets reduce purine intake, resulting in reduced systemic acid
and uric acid loads. Low-sodium diets reduce the amount of calcium in the
urine by the mechanisms described previously.

MONITORING/FOLLOW UP
Follow-up imaging: Subsequent imaging studies are recommended at 1
year for evaluation of recurrence. The study may be a
kidneys/ureter/bladder x-ray, ultrasound, or helical CT. If there is no
evidence of new stones, then imaging studies may be repeated every 5
years. Recurrent nephrolithiasis may mandate more frequent imaging. All
patients with nephrolithiasis deserve a screening evaluation for common
problems that can lead to stone formation, although there is no consensus
of how extensive evaluation should be after the first episode. Patients
with recurrent nephrolithiasis deserve a thorough metabolic evaluation,
which should be done once the acute episode has resolved and the patient
has returned to his or her daily routine.
A 24-hour urine sample should be collected on at least two occasions,
and ∼4 weeks after the acute event has resolved and the patient has
returned to his or her usual lifestyle. The drugs prescribed for stone
disease, as well as vitamin supplements, should be stopped 5 days before
urine collection.20
The following urinary parameters are routinely determined when
performing stone risk evaluation:
Total urine volume: It is desirable to achieve urinary volume >2.5 L/d
Urine pH
Creatinine: Urinary excretion of creatinine is determined to assure
adequacy of the collection. It is expected that in a 24-hour period, men
excrete ∼20 mg/kg and women 15 mg/kg of creatinine.
Calcium: normal 50 to 250 mg/d
Uric acid: normal <750 mg/d
502

Citrate: normal >250 mg/d
Oxalate: normal <40 mg/d
Sodium: <100 mmol/d is consistent with low dietary sodium intake
Phosphorus: normal <1100 mg/d
Magnesium: normal 18 to 130 mg/d
Ammonia: normal 25 to 50 mmol/d
Sulfate: normal 4 to 35 mmol/d
Urine culture and sensitivity for struvite stones
A number of commercial urine collection kits, quantitating urinary salt
composition and saturations, are widely available. To account for day-today variability in urinary salt excretion, several 24-hour urinary
collections may be necessary.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The incidence of kidney stones has increased over the years and if
untreated stones have high recurrence rate. Fortunately, most kidney
stones can be prevented by modifying the dietary habits and lifestyle
such as increased uid intake and decreasing the sodium and animal
protein content in the diet.

Management of Chronic Kidney
Disease
Nicholas Taraska and Anitha Vijayan

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a term used to describe a gradual
reduction in renal function over the span of weeks to years.
CKD can also be described as a renal injury manifested by proteinuria or
hematuria of glomerular or interstitial origin in the setting of a normal or
higher than normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR)1 (e.g., diabetic
nephropathy in early stages manifested by proteinuria or IgA
nephropathy with hematuria).
However, the term is more commonly applied to describe patients with a
GFR <60 mL/min.
The staging of CKD depends on the level of GFR, and the ensuing
complications increase in severity with worsening renal function (Fig. 241).
Majority of patients may require renal replacement therapy (RRT) or
renal transplantation at GFR below 15 mL/min. The discussion in this
chapter will focus on management of predialysis CKD.
It must be kept in mind that management of CKD patients is complicated
and involves close collaboration with their primary care physicians as
well as other specialists (endocrinologists, cardiologists, vascular
surgeons, and so forth).
506

Classification
In 2002, a National Kidney Foundation (NKF) work group released
guidelines for classifying CKD1 (Table 24-1).
This classification has helped to streamline the management of CKD, as
the terminology helps the healthcare professional as well as the patients
to clearly understand the severity of the illness and decide on treatment
strategies ​a ppropriate for the stage of CKD.
Associated Conditions
Figure 24-1 depicts the presentation of some of the comorbid conditions
in relation to the GFR and stage of CKD.
Hypertension: The pathophysiology of hypertension is multifactorial,
but sodium and water retention as well as inappropriate renin secretion
play key parts. A net positive sodium balance results in volume
expansion and resultant hypertension.
The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7)
noted that hypertension was present in the majority of patients with GFR
<60 mL/min.
The committee recommended a goal of systolic blood pressure of
<130 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of <80 mm Hg in
patients with diabetes and/or CKD.2,3

507

FIGURE 24-1. Onset of complications related to decreased GFR.
This gure shows the complications of renal dysfunction in
relation to GFR and stage of CKD. CKD, chronic kidney disease;
GFR, glomerular filtration rate.
Anemia: The oxygen demand and use by the kidneys far exceeds the 20%
to 25% of cardiac output that they receive, making them an excellent
oxygen sensor for the body.
508

The kidneys produce and secrete erythropoietin, a hormone that
stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow.
With advancing kidney damage, the kidneys are less able to produce
adequate amounts of erythropoietin necessary to maintain normal
hemoglobin levels.4
Resistance to the action of erythropoietin also plays a role in the
development and maintenance of anemia.
Renal osteodystrophy: Owing to the complex nature of this disease and
its effects on other organs and tissues besides bone, this condition is also
referred to as mineral and bone disorder or metabolic bone disease.
Dysregulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism can lead to cardiac,
vascular and other tissue calcification.
Decreased GFR results in phosphorus retention, leading to increased
production of parathyroid hormone (PTH).
Decreased 1-alpha hydroxylation of 25-OH vitamin D and decreased
serum levels of active vitamin D lead to hypocalcemia and elevation of
PTH levels.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) can lead to a state of high bone
turnover called “osteitis fibrosa,” placing CKD patients at high risk for
bone fractures.5,6
Metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia:
With advancing CKD and decreasing GFR, the ability of the kidney to
effectively eliminate the total acid load and potassium is reduced.
An individual typically generates 1 mEq H+ (acid) per kg body weight
daily, and as renal function deteriorates, the kidney in unable to excrete
this acid load.
Acidosis typically develops with GFR below 40 mL/min, unless there
is renal tubular acidosis associated with conditions such as diabetic
509

nephropathy, obstructive nephropathy, sickle-cell anemia, and so forth,
in which case acidosis is seen in earlier stages of CKD.
These patients are also at higher risk for developing hyperkalemia.
Hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease:
CKD is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular events, deaths,
and hospitalizations.7
It must be noted that a significantly higher number of patients with
stage 3 or 4 CKD die of cardiovascular causes before reaching the
need for ​dialysis or transplantation.
Modification of risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and
bone and mineral disorders is critical in reducing mortality and morbidity
from cardiovascular disease.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory Data
The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease GFR (MDRD GFR)
calculation is a creatinine-based equation used to estimate a patient’s
GFR.
It requires that the patient have a stable creatinine level.8
The equation depends on its ability to predict a patient’s normal
creatinine production level.
It has been validated in patients with CKD, African-Americans,
Caucasians, and females.
It may be inaccurate in patients with unusual diets, extremes of age or
weight, or unusual levels of skeletal muscle mass. A 24-hour urine
collection may be more accurate in these patients.
510

The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) is an
alternative equation used to estimate GFR in patients with stable
creatinine levels.9
It may underestimate the incidence of CKD as compared with the MDRD
equation in some patients, but it may be more accurate in patients with a
higher GFR.10
Table 24-1 shows the correlation of the GFR with the different stages of
CKD and highlights the clinical actions appropriate to each stage.
Table 24-2 outlines the relevant laboratory and diagnostic studies that
are useful in the evaluation of a patient with CKD.
Urine protein excretion:
Heavy proteinuria is associated with progression of renal disease, and
the amount of proteinuria serves as an indicator of the severity of disease
in ​certain glomerulonephritis.
It can be assessed in a 24-hour urine collection or by calculating the
urine protein to creatinine ratio in a spot collection (see chapter on
proteinuria).
Evaluation of anemia:
Complete blood cell count is required at initial and subsequent office
visits.
Ferritin and transferrin saturation levels are required to help guide the
treatment of anemia.
The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) work group
recommends a ferritin level >100 ng/mL and a transferrin
saturation >20% in predialysis CKD patients.4
However, these measures are not necessarily sufficient to determine
which patients will or will not respond to iron supplementation, and so
some clinicians may opt to administer iron and monitor for response
511

even in patients whose markers are at recommended goal values.11
PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and 25-OH vitamin D levels should be
measured to assist in directing the management of renal osteodystrophy.
For stages 3 and 4 CKD, the KDOQI work group recommends
maintaining corrected calcium in the “normal” range for the laboratory
used and a phosphorus value between 2.7 and 4.6 mg/dL.
Measurement of intact PTH is recommended at least every 6 to 12
months.
For patients with stage 3 CKD, the KDOQI clinical guidelines for bone
metabolism recommend an opinion-based target of an intact PTH level
between 35 and 70 pg/mL.
For patients with stage 4 CKD, the recommended target range is 70 to
110 pg/mL and measurement should occur at least every 3 months.
The KDOQI bone metabolism work group guidelines recommend
maintaining a total CO2 levels of ≥ 22 mEq/L for patients with a GFR
<60 mL/min.

A lipid panel should be checked in all CKD patients at initial office visit
and annually.
Patients with nephrotic syndrome are particularly susceptible to
dyslipidemia.
The optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target has not been
defined for the CKD population, but given the risk for cardiovascular
disease, it is generally recommended to be <100 mg/dL.
It is generally recommended that triglyceride level is kept below 200
mg/dL.

512

513

The current KDOQI Nutrition guidelines recommend checking serum
albumin every 1 to 3 months in patients with a GFR <20 mL/min as an
assessment of nutritional status because albumin is a strong prognostic
indicator in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.
Hepatitis B and C and HIV serologies may help diagnose the
underlying cause of the patient’s CKD (e.g., membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis secondary to Hepatitis C-induced cryoglobulinemia or
HIV nephropathy). Hepatitis B titers are also useful to determine which
patients need to be immunized against the disease as CKD progresses.
An antinuclear antibody can suggest the presence of autoimmune
disease as the cause of the patient’s CKD, and high titers may warrant
additional workup such as complement levels and extractable nuclear
antibody screen.
A patient with unexplained rise in serum creatinine and anemia
(especially the elderly) needs to be ruled out for monoclonal
gammopathies.
Serum and urine protein electrophoresis, along with
immunofixation, are useful diagnostic tools to evaluate for
paraproteinemia and related renal ​disorders such light chain deposition
disease, cast nephropathy, and ​a myloidosis.
514

Serum-free light chains are more sensitive in picking up monoclonal
gammopathies and should be considered in patients with high index of
suspicion.
Imaging
A renal ultrasound is usually performed after the initial visit for several
reasons.
It helps to delineate renal anatomy and verify the presence of two
normal sized kidneys.
It is useful to rule out obstruction.
It may detect abnormalities such as nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis.
It aids in the detection of cysts or renal cell cancers. Renal cell
malignancies are more common in patients with CKD.
Abnormally large kidneys (>13 cm) may suggest the presence of certain
disease such as diabetic nephropathy, HIV-associated nephropathy,
infiltrative disorders, interstitial nephritis, and so forth.
A follow-up renal ultrasound may be required if there is unexplained
changes in renal function, presence of hematuria, back pain, or other
changes on clinical evaluation.
A Doppler study of the renal arteries can help rule out renal artery
disease in a patient with resistant or difficult-to-control hypertension.
Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen may be necessary to further
evaluate for stones or to rule out malignancy.
Diagnostic Procedures
Urine microscopy:
Any patient with hematuria on urine dipstick examination should have
the urine microscopy examined by a nephrologist for the presence of
515

casts or abnormal cells.
A kidney biopsy is indicated in the setting of proteinuria and hematuria
or unexplained rise in serum creatinine.
Risks of biopsy (especially risk for life-threatening bleeding) must be
weighed against the benefit of diagnosing underlying disease. If the
diagnosis will not significantly alter treatment of prognosis, then biopsy
may not be necessary.
Kidney biopsy may be necessary in certain conditions (suspected lupus
nephritis, vasculitis) to help guide therapy.

TREATMENT
Nephrology Consultation
Referral to a nephrologist is almost always indicated once the GFR
has fallen to <30 mL/min.
However, it is highly recommended to refer at earlier stages of CKD
(i.e., GFR <60 mL/min) when the progression of renal disease is
anticipated or when further evaluation is necessary (e.g., diabetic
nephropathy, lupus nephritis, vasculitis).
The nephrology clinic is often better prepared to coordinate the care of
the CKD patient with anemia, difficult-to-control hypertension,
significant proteinuria, or primary renal disease.
Late nephrology referral is associated with poorer outcomes and
increased cost.12
Management of stage 3 CKD focuses primarily on complications that
occur with this level of renal function.
Management of stage 4 CKD involves both addressing complications of
the disease in addition to preparation for RRT and transplantation.
Management of stage 5 CKD involves continued management of the
516

complications of CKD, optimal transition to dialysis, and, if appropriate,
end-of-life discussions.
Hypertension
As stated previously, the blood pressure goal is <130/80 mm Hg.
Diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers,
alpha-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and
vasodilators are all used to achieve blood pressure goals.3,13
ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs are useful in patients with proteinuria.
ACE inhibitors and ARBs classically lower intraglomerular pressure, thus
protecting the kidneys from disease progression.
A renal function panel should be checked 1 to 2 weeks after starting
treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
A 30% increase in creatinine is considered acceptable, although often
hyperkalemia can limit the use of these medications.14
The recent ONTARGET study that examined dual renin-angiotensin–
aldosterone system blockade with both telmisartan and ramipril showed
that in patients with high vascular risk, dual therapy reduced proteinuria
better than ramipril alone but led to a higher incidence of doubling of the
creatinine, dialysis, or death.15
The patients in the ONTARGET study generally had nonnephrotic range
proteinuria.
The utility and safety of “dual therapy” in patients with heavy
proteinuria remain under clinical investigation.
A new medication, aliskiren, functions through direct inhibition of renin
and may have more potent effects if combined with ACE inhibition.
Recently, there has been interest in adding aldosterone receptor blockade
517

to ACE inhibitor therapy as an antifibrotic strategy to lower blood
pressure, reduce proteinuria, and abrogate the progression of renal
disease. However, additional long-term studies are necessary before
endorsing this additional promising therapy. Furthermore, hyperkalemia
is a possible side effect to the use of this medication.16
Edema and Volume Overload
Edema and volume overload are frequently seen in CKD, especially in the
setting of nephrotic range proteinuria, congestive heart failure,
pulmonary dysfunction, sleep apnea, and GFR <40 mL/min.
Diuretics are an effective therapy in the management of hypertension
and edema in CKD.
The effectiveness of thiazide diuretics is reduced in patients with GFR
<40 mL/min.
Loop diuretics are useful in patients with low GFRs, but their
effectiveness may be more limited in patients with a low serum albumin.
A reasonable starting dose for a loop diuretic in a patient with CKD is
furosemide 40 mg PO bid or bumetanide 1 mg PO bid. A new steady
state will be reached within 1 to 2 weeks.
Sodium restriction is also an essential component of management of
edema.
It is also important to rule out concomitant etiologies such as sleep
apnea, diastolic or systolic hear failure, and so forth.
Anemia and Iron Deficiency
If iron deficiency is diagnosed, appropriate gastrointestinal workup
should be considered.
Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, is associated with
neurological dysfunction, restless legs syndrome, fatigue, hair loss, and
even worsening of cardiac dysfunction.
518

If no contraindications exist, iron replacement should begin via the
oral route, which is the preferred first line of treatment.
We recommend ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO bid–tid.
Iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach and in an acid environment.
Patients treated with antireflux medications will not absorb iron as
efficiently as patients not taking these drugs.
If patient has suboptimal response to oral iron or if the patient is unable
to tolerate the treatment, then intravenous iron should be considered.
There are several options for intravenous iron—iron dextran, iron
sucrose, ferric gluconate, or ferumoxytol.
The least expensive option is iron dextran. Because of risk of
anaphylactic reactions, a 25-mg test dose should be administered and the
patient monitored for any adverse events. If the patient tolerates the test
dose without difficulty, a 500- to 1000-mg dose of iron dextran can be
administered over 3 to 4 hours.
Iron sucrose and ferric gluconate preparations require multiple
infusions of small doses (125 mg and 200 mg, respectively) since higher
doses can be associated with hemodynamic changes and hypotension
from sudden iron release into the circulation. These preparations are
useful in patients with history of medication allergies.17
Ferumoxytol has been associated with anaphylactic reactions.
The lowest number of adverse events has been associated with iron
sucrose.17
Not all CKD patients with anemia will have a renal-related
pathophysiologic mechanism for their reduced hemoglobin level.
An iron-deficient stage 3 CKD patient requires a standard anemia
workup, including age-appropriate cancer screening measures to rule out
malignancies.
519

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs):
Erythropoietin replacement or ESA is necessary once hemoglobin levels
fall to <10 g/dL.
The current Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend that
ESA should be used only to prevent blood transfusion and not to treat
symptoms such as fatigue and decreased energy.
Currently approved ESAs include epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa.
There is no well-defined critical threshold for initiating an ESA in CKD
patients. In the opinion of the KDOQI anemia management work group,
initial starting doses for the above-approved ESAs are not defined and
should be determined according to clinical circumstances and the
patient’s starting hemoglobin levels.
A typical starting dose of epoetin alfa is 50 to 100 units/kg
subcutaneously every week or darbepoetin alfa 40 mcg subcutaneously
every 2 weeks.
The subcutaneous route is preferred in stages 3 and 4 CKD patients.
The 2006 NKF KDOQI guidelines recommend keeping the hemoglobin
levels >11 g/dL; however, the Food and Drug Administration also
recommends an upper target hemoglobin limit of 12 g/dL.22
Higher hemoglobin levels are not necessarily beneficial to patients
(normal hematocrit and CHOIR trials).18,19
The TREAT study recently evaluated CKD patients given darbepoetin,
targeting a hemoglobin level of 13 g/dL. Treated patients required
significantly fewer transfusions but had a statistically significant higher
incidence of stroke. There was no significant difference in cardiovascular
event, progression to ESRD, or death.20
As hemoglobin levels >13 g/dL during ESA therapy have been
associated with increased rates of blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, and
520

death, the complete blood cell count should be monitored at least
monthly while administering an ESA to avoid exceeding that level.21
Renal Osteodystrophy/Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
The management of ROD is complex and involves reduction of
phosphorus in diet, use of phosphate binders, and appropriate use of
vitamin D analogs.
Dietary restriction:
It is generally recommended to restrict phosphorus intake to 800 to
1200 mg/d.
See Table 24-3 for a list of commonly used high-phosphorus foods.
The list is not comprehensive and so patients should be counseled on
reading food labels.
Phosphorus binders:
Phosphorus binders are primarily calcium compounds (calcium
carbonate or acetate). Aluminum compounds are rarely used because of
risk of toxicity.
Other binders, such as sevelamer hydrochloride or carbonate, are not
approved for use in predialysis CKD.
Similarly, lanthanum carbonate is a an effective phosphorus binder but
not approved for use in predialysis patients.

521

Because of concern of excessive calcium loading and vascular
calcification, it is generally recommended to limit the amount of
elemental calcium no more than 2000 mg/d. As an example, a 500mg tablet of calcium carbonate provides 200 mg of elemental calcium.
Vitamin D analogs:
Active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol also known as
“calcitriol”) provides a feedback mechanism to the parathyroid gland to
reduce PTH production and secretion.
Active vitamin D therapy can lead to unacceptable increases in calcium
and phosphorus levels via its action on the small intestine. Therefore, it is
primarily used in patients whose calcium and phosphorus are already
controlled with the interventions listed above.
Some active vitamin D analogs, such as paricalcitol, retain the PTHlowering effect of calcitriol with less hypercalcemia and
hyperphosphatemia.22
Another analog that is available for use in the United States is
522

doxercalciferol.23
The typical starting dose for calcitriol is 0.25 mcg PO daily, for
paricalcitol it is 1 mcg PO daily or 2 mcg PO three times a week, and for
doxercalciferol it is 1 mcg/d.
Serum calcium and phosphorus should be evaluated within 2 to 4
weeks of therapy initiation to check for hypercalcemia and
hyperphosphatemia. Whether therapy is instituted with calcitriol or an
analog such as paricalcitol, the calcium, phosphorus, and intact PTH
should be checked in about 2 weeks.23
Vitamin D repletion:
The KDOQI bone metabolism work group recommends replacement of
25-hydroxy vitamin D, the storage form, once levels fall to <30 ng/mL.
In stages 3 and 4 CKD patients with levels <5 ng/mL, ergocalciferol
(50,000 IU, orally) should be given weekly for 12 weeks and then
monthly thereafter.
For patients with milder deficiency (5 to 15 ng/mL), the same dose of
ergocalciferol is given weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly thereafter.
For patients with insufficiency (16 to 30 ng/mL), the work group
recommends monthly ergocalciferol (50,000 units).
For patients with deficiency (levels <30 ng/mL), the work group
recommends repeating the blood measurement of 25-hydroxy vitamin D
after 6 months of treatment.6
Metabolic Acidosis
Metabolic acidosis can lead to decreased albumin production, increased
calcium resorption from bone, and worsening of SHPT.
The best available option to treat acidosis is sodium bicarbonate 650
to 1300 mg PO bid–tid. A 650-mg tablet contains 7.6 mEq of
bicarbonate.
523

Maintaining bicarbonate levels above 22 mEq/L will help preserve
bone histology and lessen the impact of acidosis on protein catabolism.
Correction of acidosis will also help in the management of hyperkalemia.
A recent randomized controlled study also noted that treatment with
sodium bicarbonate decelerated the rate of progression to ESRD,
while improving nutritional parameters in CKD patients.24
Hyperlipidemia
CKD patients should be considered to be in the highest risk group for
coronary artery disease.
The updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment
Program (NCEP ATP) III guidelines for cholesterol management
recommend a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal of <100 mg/dL
for high-risk patients defined as those with established CHD or coronary
heart disease risk equivalents.25
Lifestyle modifications are recommended for LDL 100 to 130 mg/dL as
initial line of therapy.
Medications are recommended for those with LDL above 130 mg/dL or
those failing lifestyle modifications.
Statins are first-line agents in CKD.

524

Hypertriglyceridemia is treated using lifestyle and dietary modifications
as well as medications with goal of triglycerides of <200 mg/dL.
Fibrates such as gemfibrozil are appropriate for use in CKD but the
combination of fibrates and statins in the setting of CKD can result in
rhabdomyolysis.
Appropriate dose adjustments are necessary for the levels of renal
function.
A recent review has concisely summarized the role, safety, initial dosing,
and potential benefits of statins in patients with CKD and ESRD. In brief,
statins are safe in the CKD population and, although they demonstrate
similar relative risk reductions for cardiovascular events as compared
525

with non-CKD patients, the absolute risk reductions are greater in the
CKD population, given the high rates of underlying cardiovascular
disease.26
Hyperkalemia
Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening complication of CKD.
The acute management of this electrolyte imbalance is discussed
elsewhere.
Dietary restriction:
Patients should be counseled regarding the restriction of high-potassium
foods in their diet.
High potassium content is seen in all types of foods, but the common
ones are citrus fruits/juices; bananas; watermelons; dried foods such as
raisins, prunes, and dates; vegetables such as tomatoes, potatoes, and
broccoli; and other food products such as milk.
See Table 24-4 for a more comprehensive list of high-potassium foods.
However, this does NOT include all possible food items that may contain
high potassium content.
Patients should be offered medical nutritional therapy (MNT) by a
licensed dietician and should be taught to read food labels regarding
potassium concentration.
Medications:
Patients should be counseled on avoiding medications such as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cox-2 inhibitors.
Inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system should be used
with caution, as renal function deteriorates and electrolytes should be
checked routinely.
Corrections of acidosis:
526

Treatment of metabolic acidosis will help correct hyperkalemia.
Loop diuretics:
Treatment with loop diuretics will also aid in potassium excretion.
Hyperuricemia
Hyperuricemia is associated with metabolic syndrome and increased risk
for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.27
Hyperuricemia is prevalent in CKD due to decreased uric acid excretion
as well as the use of diuretics, which further decrease uric acid
excretion.28
Hyperuricemia in CKD can manifest as painful gout flares or chronic
tophaceous gout.28
Treatment of hyperuricemia and gout involves use of steroids or
colchicine to treat acute flares. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medications, which are very effective, have to be used with extreme
caution (if not at all) due to risk of worsening renal function, blood
pressure control, and hyperkalemia.
Once acute flare has been treated, it is recommended that a xanthine
oxidase inhibitor such as allopurinol or febuxostat be used to lower uric
acid levels.
A recent small study suggested that treatment of hyperuricemia with
allopurinol in CKD patients may slow down progression to ESRD.29
Prevention of Acute Kidney Injury and Monitoring of
Concomitant Medications
Prevention of additional renal insults is essential in decreasing
progression to ESRD.
Intravenous contrast is a frequent cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in
high-risk patients, and they should be aware of this risk. Please refer to
527

the chapter on contrast-induced nephropathy.
Likewise, surgeries or other procedures in the hospital associated with
hypotension will increase the risk of AKI.
Studies have shown that CKD patients who develop AKI and recover
renal function, still progress faster to ESRD than those patients who do
not develop AKI.30
Concomitant medications should be addressed at every visit.
Medications should be dose-adjusted to prevent side effects from
accumulation in the setting of decreased renal function.
Medications should be discontinued or dose-adjusted to decrease further
renal injury.
Patients should be asked and counseled regarding use of over-the-counter
medications, supplements, herbal products, and vitamins, since all of
these agents can interact with other medications, exacerbate renal
dysfunction, or cause electrolyte imbalances.

PREPARATION FOR DIALYSIS AND RENAL TRANSPLANT
Patient Education
Lifestyle modifications are essential in decreasing cardiovascular risk and
include, but are not restricted to, weight loss, reduction of dietary sodium
intake, regular exercise, and smoking cessation.
Smoking is associated with increased progression to ESRD.
A comprehensive education program is usually offered to all CKD
patients, typically when GFR falls below 30 mL/min, in order to prepare
them for RRT.
The program should encompass educating patients regarding different
modalities of RRT—hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and
renal transplantation.
528

The dieticians should be available to give nutritional counseling.
Patients should be encouraged to tour a HD facility and meet HD and PD
patients.
Patients should also be given information regarding different types of
HD options (nocturnal, in-center, home HD, etc.) as well as chance to be
evaluated for kidney transplantation.
Social work staff should be available to address concerns such as
insurance, cost, transportation to dialysis, and so forth.
It is the responsibility of the treating nephrologist to address the
suitability of dialysis initiation with his/her patients, and often their
family members, and plan accordingly.
Dialysis initiation may not be appropriate at extremely advanced age
(in patients with multiple comorbid conditions) or patients in nursing
home, since dialysis has not been shown to improve quality of life or
significantly prolong it.31
Nutritional Counseling
The 2004 KDOQI recommendations were made from modifications from
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to apply to
patients with CKD.
Individualizing the dietetic therapy may ultimately prove to be the most
appropriate strategy for CKD patients.
It is essential that CKD patients receive MNT counseling. This is offered
by licensed renal dieticians and covered under some insurance plans.
Patients should be counseled about the consequences of a high-protein
diet, including the generation of extra solute (i.e., urea) that will need to
be eliminated and the enhanced production of an acid load that will also
need to be excreted.
Although current recommendations suggest reducing dietary protein
529

intake to minimize the need for urea and acid excretion, a risk of
malnutrition does exist.
Malnutrition in the setting of a GFR higher than that normally
recommended for initiating RRT maybe an indication to start dialysis.
Appropriate counseling regarding low-potassium or low-phosphorus
diet is also a part of nutritional management.
MNT also involves counseling regarding food choices appropriate for
those with diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.
Immunizations
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s January 2010 adult
vaccination schedule can be found online at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm5901-Immunization.pdf.32
The most commonly administered vaccines to CKD patients are listed
below
Hepatitis B:
Although hepatitis B immunization is not required for all patients with
CKD, it is generally recommended for those expected to start dialysis,
given the risk of transmission in dialysis units.
There is a three-dose regimen, with the second dose given at least 1
month later and the third given at least 2 months later but >4 months
from the first dose.
An alternative schedule is necessary if the combined hepatitis A and B
vaccine is used.
Surface antibody immunity can be checked 1 to 6 months after the
vaccination has been completed. Levels of hepatitis B surface antibody
should exceed >10 mIU/mL.
Booster doses are recommended for dialysis patients if levels fall below
530

this value.
Pneumococcal vaccination:
The CDC recommends pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination for all
patients with CKD.
Current guidelines recommend a one-time revaccination 5 years after the
initial vaccination for patients older than 65 years, if the initial
vaccination was given when they were younger than 65 years.
Influenza vaccination:
Influenza vaccination is recommended annually for all individuals aged
50 years and older.
The CDC also recommends annual influenza vaccination (inactivated
vaccine) for all younger patients with CKD.
Referral for Dialysis Access and Transplantation
Patients with GFR <30 mL/min (stage 4 CKD) should be referred for
vascular access if HD is the preferred RRT of choice.
The NKF also has KDOQI practice guidelines detailing recommendations
for vascular access.
An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the most preferred access for HD
patients; however, these take longer time to mature and may not be
feasible in patients with extensive vascular disease.
The next preferred access is arteriovenous graft (AVG), where a
synthetic material is used to connect the artery to the vein. AVG has a
higher ​tendency to thrombose compared with AVF but is preferred over
tunneled HD ​catheters.
Although it is difficult to anticipate exactly when a patient will need to
initiate RRT, an AVF should ideally be placed 6 months prior to the
start of HD and an AVG placed at least 3 to 6 weeks prior to the start
531

of HD.
Early referral to a vascular surgeon is extremely vital for several
reasons:
Preoperative studies (e.g., vein mapping) can be completed and access
placed in a timely manner.33
Further, the nondominant upper extremity is the preferred site for AVF
placement. This arm should be protected from IV access, including
peripheral IVs, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines, and
subclavian lines. It may also be useful to avoid measuring blood pressures
on the arm preferred for AVF placement.33
If PD is the initial preferred modality of choice, then patients should be
referred to the specific PD nurses for further assessment. Several issues
need to be addressed before the patient is considered as an appropriate
candidate.
Does the patient have adequate support at home?
Is the patient capable of understanding and performing the procedure at
home?
Does the patient have a clean home environment?
Early surgical evaluation is useful to rule out potential problems such as
ventral/ umbilical hernias.
Ideally, the PD catheter should be placed at least 2 weeks prior to the
anticipated start of PD.
Transplantation:
Suitable candidates with stage 4 CKD should be referred for evaluation
by a multidisciplinary kidney transplant clinic.
Typically, patients cannot be listed for transplantation until the GFR has
fallen to <20 mL/min.
532

Not all patients are eligible for a kidney transplant, and it is
responsibility of the treating nephrologist to advise the patient regarding
the appropriateness of transplantation, which involves major surgery and
complications of immunosuppression.
Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy
Timing of initiation of RRT is a very difficult problem in the
management of CKD patients.
In practical terms, it is advisable to initiate dialysis in patients with CKD
secondary to diabetic nephropathy once the GFR is <15 mL/min.
In patients with CKD from other causes, dialysis may be delayed until
GFR declines below 10 mL/min.
Although the values presented here are convenient, they are not absolute.
In cases of severe malnutrition, diuretic resistant volume overload, or
profound, resistant metabolic acidosis, RRT may need to be initiated at
higher levels of GFR.
However, starting dialysis based on GFR levels alone is no longer
recommended on the basis of recent data.
The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late trial examined starting dialysis
with a GFR between 10 and 14 cc/min versus 5 to 7 cc/min and found no
benefit in early initiation with respect to dialysis complications,
infections, or cardiovascular events.34
Signs and symptoms of uremia such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting,
restless legs, severe itching, headaches, shortness of breath, volume
overload refractory to diuretics, and laboratory manifestations such
persistent hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and SHPT despite adequate
treatment are good indicators to guide the timing of initiation of RRT.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The loss of kidney function in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) results in
uremia and an impairment in the regulation of fluids and electrolytes.
Without intervention, ESRD is inevitably fatal.
Therapeutic options include hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis,
transplantation, and supportive/palliative care. HD is the most
commonly utilized form of renal replacement therapy.
Epidemiology
Of the 490,000 patients with ESRD in the United States, over 300,000 are
currently on HD.1
Like the general ESRD population, the prevalent HD population is
predominately white (55% white, 38% black, 4% Asian, 3% Native
American/other), with a slightly higher proportion of males (54%).
Diabetes is the most common underlying diagnosis, followed by
hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and congenital and cystic kidney
diseases.
The largest age group of HD patients is between 70 and 79 years. This
differs from the generalized ESRD population, whose mean age is 58
years, and reflects a younger and generally healthier cohort undergoing
transplant and peritoneal dialysis.
Despite advances in care, the mortality rate in HD patients is startling.

538

Cardiovascular disease is clearly the leading cause of death among
patients on HD, followed by septicemia.
The probability of death in the first 5 years after starting HD is 63%.2
Among diabetics on HD, this probability rises to 71%.
Dialysis patients over the age of 65 have a mortality rate seven times
higher than the general Medicare population. Dialysis patients between
the ages of 20 and 64 have a mortality rate eight times higher.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation: Who Requires Dialysis?
Given the poor outcomes for patients on HD, every effort should be
undertaken to preserve residual renal function.
Early nephrology referrals, patient education, and serious consideration
of transplant options may be helpful in attenuating the progression to
ESRD.
Even with aggressive early medical care, dialysis may become necessary
to relieve uremic symptoms, electrolyte imbalances, or fluid accumulation
due to declining renal function.
The vast majority of patients who require HD have chronic kidney
diseases with a gradual but progressive loss of renal function over time.
Patients usually develop uremic symptoms and require dialysis
initiation, as their estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below
10 mL/min/1.73 m2.3
Patients with significant comorbidities, particularly diabetes, may
require dialysis initiation at an earlier stage, usually near an estimated
GFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Uremic symptoms develop due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites,
which are no longer adequately cleared by the failing kidney.
539

This may manifest in a variety of ways, including nausea, vomiting,
poor energy levels, decreased appetite, lethargy, pruritus, and a metallic
aftertaste.
Motor neuropathies may be elicited on physical exam, while asterixis,
tremor, and myoclonus suggest uremic encephalopathy.
Uremic pericarditis manifests as a pericardial friction rub or pericardial
effusion, and is a clear indication for urgent initiation of dialytic
therapy.
Acute kidney injury may also require dialytic support, particularly in
those who develop pulmonary edema, hyperkalemia, or metabolic
acidosis.
Acute indications for the initiation of dialysis can be remembered with
the mnemonic AEIOU:
Acidosis: life-threatening metabolic acidosis with a pH <7.2, not
responsive to conservative treatments.
Electrolyte abnormalities: life-threatening hyperkalemia associated with
electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and symptomatic hypermagnesemia
and hypercalcemia.
Intoxications: there are a limited number of intoxications for which HD is
indicated. It should be considered in patients with deteriorating medical
status, those whose measured levels of a substance are indicative of poor
outcomes, or those with metabolic derangements (e.g., metabolic acidosis
caused by intoxication). Substances that are effectively cleared with
dialysis have the following characteristics:
Low molecular weight (<500 Da)
High water solubility
Low degree of protein binding
Small volumes of distribution (<1 L/kg)
540

High dialysis clearance relative to endogenous clearance
The following substances can be cleared with dialysis: barbiturates,
bromides, chloral hydrate, alcohols, lithium, theophylline, procainamide,
salicylates, atenolol, and sotalol.
Overload: fluid overload or pulmonary edema not responsive to
aggressive diuresis
Uremia: mental status changes attributable to uremia, uremic pericarditis, or neuropathy, bleeding diatheses, or vomiting associated with
uremia.

TREATMENT
Dialysis Modalities
Choosing the appropriate HD modality is an important decision that
should be made with the consideration of both patient preference and a
practical assessment of patient resources and capabilities.
The primary variables that differentiate the various modalities are:
location, independence, duration, and cumulative dialysis dose.
Intermittent in-center HD is the most common form of HD.
This form of HD typically involves treatments three times per week, with
each session averaging between 3 and 4 hours in duration.
Patients receive HD at an in-center location, where trained staff are able
to set up and supervise each treatment. For patients new to HD, this is
often the modality of choice to acclimate patients to a supervised and
controlled HD session.
Intermittent home HD is similar to intermittent in-center HD in
frequency and duration of treatments.
The key difference is location, giving patients the greater freedom of
undergoing treatments at their own homes.

The home environment must be carefully evaluated, and both water
supply and electricity must be able to accommodate the dialysis system.
Furthermore, patients need to demonstrate sufficient responsibility over
their treatments and the ability to cannulate their own arteriovenous
accesses with a safe and sterile technique.
Short daily HD exposes patients to more frequent treatments (usually six
times per week), although with a shorter duration of each session.
The cumulative weekly dose of dialysis is similar to that obtained on
intermittent HD. However, dividing the treatments into frequent, shorter
treatments may prevent intradialytic complications, particularly
hypotension and cramping.
This modality is predominately performed at home, although some incenter locations are able to accommodate the daily treatments.
Nocturnal HD is different, in that it offers a larger cumulative dose of
dialysis each week.
Patients who undergo nocturnal HD at home typically have longer
treatment time periods, averaging 6 to 8 hours, performed six nights per
week.
This modality does have the added convenience of allowing the patient
greater freedom during the day.
Like short daily HD, nocturnal HD is predominately done at home,
although in-center locations are available. In-center nocturnal HD
typically offers 8-hour treatments, three nights per week.
The decision to dialyze patients with acute renal failure is often
performed based on acute indications, and the selection of modalities is
often done in consideration of the patient’s hemodynamic status. A full
description of dialysis options, including continuous dialysis modalities, is
addressed in Chapter 15, Renal Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney
Injury.
Dialysis Access
542

For HD to be effective, there must first be an effective system of blood
delivery from the patient to the machine, and vice versa. This is referred
to as a dialysis access.
There are three types of dialysis access: arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs),
arteriovenous grafts (AVG), and dialysis catheters.
Fistulas and grafts are vascular conduits that can support a high flow of
blood. They are cannulated at each dialysis treatment with two needles—
one through which arterial blood is pumped through the dialyzer, and the
other through which blood is returned into the venous system.
Catheters are placed in a central venous position, typically in the
internal jugular location, with flow through separate luminal ports to
simulate arterial output and venous return. Specific characteristics of
each type of access are described below.
The AVF is the most desirable form of vascular access. It is created by the
surgical manipulation of a patient’s native vasculature.
Construction is performed under regional anesthesia by an experienced
vascular surgeon and can consist of either a side-to-side anastomosis
between an artery and vein or a side-of-artery to end-of-vein
anastomosis.
The goal is to provide an access site that can withstand repeated
cannulation with large bore needles, and can sustain the high flow of
blood necessary for dialysis. Flow through an AVF averages between 600
and 800 cc/min and may be able to maintain patency at flows of 200
cc/min.
Complications with thrombosis, infection, and vascular steal are lower in
comparison to the AVG.
Placement of an AVF requires foresight, as they can take 3 to 4 months
to mature. Furthermore, the construction of an adequate AVF may be
impossible if the patient lacks healthy vasculature. In particular, patients
with advanced diabetes or peripheral vascular disease may not have
543

vessels that are amenable to the creation of a fistula.
The AVG can be placed in patients for whom an AVF cannot be created.
In lieu of the patient’s native vasculature, a synthetic graft (frequently
created from polytetrafluoroethylene) is placed for the arteriovenous
connection.
Long-term patency rates are less impressive than those obtained with
AVF. However, the AVG does have a few advantages, including a large
surface area for cannulation and a shorter maturation time, on the rate
of 3 to 4 weeks.
Flow rates through an AVG are typically 1000 to 1500 cc/min, with
thrombosis occurring at flows less than 600 to 800 cc/min.
A catheter is the least desirable form of vascular access for HD.
Cuffed tunneled dialysis catheters are typically placed in the right
internal jugular vein, with a tunneled exit site just below the ipsilateral
clavicle.
These can be placed in patients requiring HD who do not yet have a site
for a permanent vascular access. However, given variable success with
flows, difficulties with recirculation, catheter dysfunction, and significant
risk of infection, the catheter should not be used except as an access of
last resort.

BASIC MECHANISM OF HD
The goal of HD is to replace the basic functions of the failing kidney. To
approximate normal kidney function, HD must clear uremic solutes,
adjust serum electrolytes, and remove accumulated fluid.
Diffusion and convection are the mechanisms responsible for the
balance of solutes and electrolytes. Ultrafiltration is the mechanism
responsible for the removal of fluid.
Diffusion uses the difference in solute concentration between blood and
544

dialysate to drive the movement of small particles.
To maximize the gradient between blood and dialysate, the blood flows
through fibers with a semi-permeable membrane in one direction, while
the dialysate flows in the opposite direction.
Although any molecule smaller than the membrane pore is capable of
moving between compartments, diffusion favors the movement of smaller
molecules, as they possess a higher particle velocity and a greater
likelihood of contact with the membrane surface.
The lower concentration of potassium and higher amount of bicarbonate
in dialysate are responsible for removal of potassium and correction of
metabolic acidosis in the blood.
Ultrafiltration utilizes a hydrostatic pressure gradient to move fluid
from blood to the discarded dialysate.
The extent of ultrafiltration can be controlled by the dialysis machine.
Convection is based on the principle of solute drag.
When fluid moves from blood to dialysate, the flow of fluid “drags”
particles across the dialysis membrane.
Convection moves small and middle-sized molecules across the pores of
the dialysis membrane.
Dialysis Prescription
The dialysis prescription should be tailored to the specific goals of
attaining adequate clearance of toxins, maintaining electrolyte balance,
and removing excess fluid gains (Table 25-1).
Attaining Dialysis Adequacy: Time, Flow, and Choice of Dialyzer
For chronic HD, the adequacy of dialysis dose is modeled by two
equations, the Kt/V and the urea reduction ratio. Both can be
measured with dialysis treatments and reflect the clearance of urea.
545

Kt/V is a ratio that relates the volume of cleared plasma (Kt) to the
volume of urea distribution (V).
The guidelines instituted by the National Kidney Foundation’s Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) set the minimal Kt/V for a
patient dialyzed thrice weekly at 1.2 for each dialysis treatment.
However, the target goal is 15% higher, that is, a Kt/V of 1.4.4
The urea reduction rate (URR) similarly reflects the removal of urea
and is calculated using blood urea nitrogen (BUN) from pre- and
postdialysis treatment:
URR = (BUNpre–BUNpost)/BUNpre
A Kt/V of 1.3 roughly correlates to a URR of 70%. K/DOQI guidelines
recommend the attainment of a minimal URR of 65% and a target URR
of 70%.
For the goal of attaining adequate Kt/V and URR values, the principle
variables are: duration of treatment, blood flow, dialysate flow, and
dialyzer size.
A typical dialysis treatment is between 3 and 4 hours in length and is
administered thrice weekly. Time on dialysis can be increased if Kt/V
and/or URR reflect poor dialysis. However, it is often dependent on the
patient’s willingness to stay for additional treatment time.

546

Blood flow rate is largely dependent on the access used. Most grafts and
fistulas can support blood flow between 400 and 500 cc/min. Catheters
are less predictable, and, on average, support flows of 350 to 400
cc/min.
Maximizing blood flows can be extremely helpful in attaining target
goals.
Patients with decreasing dialysis adequacy and poor blood flows from
their access should be evaluated for vascular stenosis or thrombosis.
547

Correction of flow-limiting complications or changing the type of access
from a catheter to an AVG/AVF permits higher blood flows and improves
dialysis adequacy.
Dialysate flow rate is generally between 500 and 800 cc/min.
Titrating the dialysate flow rate is an option, particularly in those with a
prescribed dialysate flow under 800 cc/min, but it is unlikely that
increasing the rate beyond 800 cc/min will contribute significantly to
improved clearance.
Dialyzer size refers to the amount of exposed surface area between blood
and dialysate.
A larger exposed surface area can also be used to help improve
adequacy.
The availability of various dialyzers is institution dependent, though
most dialysis facilities are stocked with high-efficiency dialyzers.
Attaining Electrolyte Balance: The Dialysate Composition
The choice of dialysate is the key variable for the balance of serum
electrolytes and the correction of conditions such as hyperkalemia.
Potassium, sodium, calcium, and bicarbonate levels are the primary
electrolytes that can be controlled in the choice of a dialysate solution.
Potassium concentration in the dialysate can vary widely depending
on the patient’s pre-HD potassium concentration.
For a patient potassium of ≥5.5 mEq/L, a dialysate potassium
concentration of 2 or 3 mEq/L is appropriate.
In those with a propensity toward arrhythmias, the 3 mEq/L bath is
preferred to avoid precipitating hypokalemia.
A dialysate potassium concentration of 4 mEq/L is appropriate for
patients with hypokalemia or persistent serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L.
548

In those with a potassium of >6.5 to 7.0 mEq/L or EKG changes
concerning for hyperkalemia, a 0 or 1 mEq/L potassium bath may be
required for a rapid correction. However, this can cause a rapid fall in
potassium levels, and serum potassium levels should be monitored every
30 to 60 minutes.
It is important to also acknowledge that there is a rebound in potassium
levels 1 to 2 hours after dialysis. Further supplementation of potassium
based on laboratory results drawn immediately after a dialysis treatment
is unwise unless there are extenuating circumstances.
A dialysate sodium concentration of 140 to 145 mEq/L is appropriate
in most circumstances, but can be adjusted in patients with preexisting
dysnatremias to prevent overcorrection.
Low serum sodium levels in dialysis patients are often indicative of
excessive free water intake in the context of limited, or absent, capacity
for renal water handling.
The majority of these patients can be managed through the enforcement
of a fluid restriction.
Initiating dialysis on patients with chronic hyponatremia requires
caution. When dialyzing patients with a chronic serum sodium of <130
mEq/L, the dialysate sodium concentration should be no more than 15 to
20 mEq/L above the serum levels.
Patients with hypernatremia should also be corrected slowly. Dialysate
sodium should be between 3 and 5 mEq/L lower than serum levels.
Most dialysate preparations are available with 2.5, 3, or 3.5 mEq/L Ca
concentrations.
A 2.5 mEq/L calcium concentration is equivalent to an ionized calcium
concentration of 5 mg/dL.
In chronic HD patients, there are concerns about positive calcium
balance contributing to vascular calcification and cardiovascular
549

morbidity and mortality.5 Because of this, a 2.5 mEq/L Ca bath is
generally recommended.
In patients with persistent hypocalcemia, as in patients who have had a
parathyroidectomy, this may need to be increased to maintain serum
calcium levels in a safe range.
A higher calcium bath or 3 or 3.5 mEq/L is also used in patients who
undergo HD acutely or have a significant concurrent acidosis, as the
correction of acidosis on dialysis further lowers the plasma calcium
concentrations.
Most chronic dialysis centers use dialysate solutions containing
bicarbonate levels of 35 to 38 mEq/L. This is usually sufficient to
correct the metabolic acidosis associated with chronic renal failure.
There are patients who are susceptible to alkalosis, particularly those
who are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), have vomiting or
nasogastric suction, have poor protein intake, or have respiratory
alkalosis. To avoid detrimental effects of alkalemia, including
arrhythmias, headaches, soft tissue calcifications, a lower bicarbonate
bath of 20 to 28 mEq/L can be used.
Attaining Appropriate Volume Status: Prescribing Ultrafiltration
The goal of volume removal in dialysis patients is to attain the patient’s
estimated dry weight (EDW).
The dry weight refers to a weight in which the patient is clinically
euvolemic and does not demonstrate symptomatic volume
contraction (particularly cramping).
Ultrafiltrating to the EDW allows physicians to remove fluid weight that
is gained in between dialysis treatments.
Ideally, dialysis patients should restrict fluid intake to limit intradialytic
weight gains to <4 kg, as excessive fluid gains may exceed the capacity
to ultrafiltrate during a single treatment.
550

Attempts to remove >4 to 5 L of fluid during a standard 3 to 4 hour
treatment may cause uncomfortable fluid shifts and intradialytic
hypotension.
In patients who are well over their dry weight with evidence of edema,
aggressive volume removal can be paired with additional treatments to
continue ultrafiltration.
It is also important to acknowledge that a patient’s dry weight is not a
fixed number.
As a result of improved or worsened nutritional status, a patient’s dry
weight may increase or decrease. This is a result of true weight that is
gained, and not merely fluid retention.
Patients with limited intradialytic fluid gains and no edema, who note
hypotension, lightheadedness, or severe cramping, should be considered
for an increase in their EDW.
Patients who are attaining their usual EDW, but develop worsening
edema or shortness of breath, should be challenged with fluid removal to
a lower EDW to prevent florid volume retention.
Anticoagulation
Heparinization during HD minimizes clotting of the dialysis circuit during
the treatment.
Clotting is particularly problematic among patients with a high
hemoglobin and hematocrit, a high rate of ultrafiltration, and a low
blood flow on dialysis.
In the United States, unfractionated heparin is most commonly used to
prevent this, although low-molecular-weight heparins can also be used.
Heparin may be given as a bolus of 1000 to 2000 units, followed by a
constant infusion of 1000 to 1200 units per hour.
Alternatively, a bolus can be followed by intermittent re-bolusing as
551

necessary to maintain target clotting times.

COMPLICATIONS
Access Complications
Poor flow:
Stenosis of an AVG or AVF can affect both arterial and venous flow.6 It
should be suspected in patients with a decreased rate of blood flow on
dialysis, declining dialysis adequacy, or elevated venous pressures on
dialysis.
Prolonged bleeding time periods from the access after needle removal
may also indicate vascular congestion as a result of a venous outflow
obstruction.
Patients with a suspected stenosis should have an evaluation of their
access with a fistulogram.
A percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgical revision is
warranted in lesions that are >50% of the lumenal diameter.
If angioplasty is required more than two times within a 3-month period,
the patient should be referred back to vascular surgery for a possible
revision.
Stents are sometimes placed for surgically inaccessible lesions, limited
access, or patients with surgical contraindications.
Thrombosis can be detected by the absence of a bruit or thrill, and
should be addressed promptly to salvage the access.
Evaluation with a fistulogram is necessary to exclude the possibility of
stenosis.
Thrombectomies can be performed to treat AVG thrombosis, though they
have limited success in AVF. Thrombosis of a fistula may require referral
to the access surgeon for reevaluation. If extensive surgical revision or
552

new fistula placement is necessary, patient may require a tunneled
catheter for access until the new access is ready.
Poor flow from a catheter can result from malpositioning, kinking,
thrombus formation, and central venous stenosis.
Early malfunction, preventing successful use shortly after catheter
placement, may require positional adjustments or an exchange over a
guide wire.
Thrombosis and stenosis should be suspected in previously functional
catheters that are now unable to sustain flows >300 cc/min.
Intralumenal thrombosis is a common complication that can be treated
by instilling the catheter with a thrombolytic, such as alteplase.7
A dwell time of 30 minutes is usually sufficient to restore flow, although
a repeated trial for 30 to 60 minutes is warranted if suspected catheter
thrombosis does not respond to the initial treatment.
Persistent tunneled catheter failure warrants a contrast study to evaluate
for a fibrin sheath. These can be removed or disrupted via fibrin sheath
stripping or balloon angioplasty.
The placement of stiff, nonsilicone catheters—particularly in the
subclavian position—also increases the risk of central stenosis. Although
this may remain clinically silent during catheter use, it can cause
dysfunction in subsequent arteriovenous accesses. For this reason,
subclavian catheters should be avoided for HD unless absolutely
necessary.
Recirculation:
Recirculation describes a phenomenon by which blood returning to the
patient through the venous needle is taken back up by the arterial needle
and recirculated through the dialysis mechanism (Fig. 25-1).
Recirculation adversely affects the efficiency and adequacy of dialysis.
553

Recirculation can occur from different mechanisms.
Stenosis at the venous end of an access can impair flow and allow the
blood to be pulled back through the extracorporeal circuit.
Recirculation can also occur if the site of venous return is in close
proximity to the arterial outflow.
Correction of stenosis, proper needle placement, and repositioning of
dialysis catheters are all useful in decreasing the likelihood of access
recirculation.

recirculation.

ow on dialysis. B: Access

Infection:
Infections represent the second most common cause of mortality in ESRD
patients and are an important part of management in dialysis patients.
Exit site infections are identified by wound cultures at the site of an
erythematous or tender catheter.
Infected sites should be cleaned thoroughly and topical antibiotics should
554

be applied.
In the presence of an exudate or discharge, wound cultures should be
sent and intravenous (IV) antibiotics initiated.
If there is discharge from the actual tunnel site, the catheter should be
removed.
Catheter-related bacteremia is identified by constitutional symptoms
along with growth from blood cultures and stigmata associated with
catheter infection (purulence, erythema, and tenderness).
Initial antibiotic coverage should include gram-positive organisms,
particularly Staphylococci, as well as gram-negative organisms.
Dual coverage with vancomycin and gentamicin is recommended as
empiric therapy.
Blood culture growth, speciation, and antibiotic sensitivities should guide
continued therapy.
Removing an infected catheter is more successful than attempts to
salvage catheters with antibiotics alone. However, as dialysis
patients require regular access for treatment sessions, some find it
impractical to remove all catheters. 8
In a stable patient who demonstrates prompt clinical improvement and
has no indications of a tunneled infection, immediate removal of the
catheter may not be necessary and the patient should be started on a 3week course of antibiotics. However, once blood cultures are negative, a
catheter exchange is recommended.
Patients who demonstrate a poor clinical response after 36 hours of
antibiotic therapy or any deterioration of clinical status should have the
catheter promptly removed.
If dialysis is necessary prior to clinical improvement, a temporary
dialysis catheter can be placed for individual treatment sessions.
555

Catheters should also be removed as soon as possible for all
catheter-​related infections with Staphylococcus aureus or gramnegative organisms.
Infections of grafts or fistulas are less common.
Areas of fluctuance should be evaluated with ultrasound for evidence of
an abscess.
Extensive graft infections may require partial or complete graft
excisions.
Infections of AVFs are rare and require a course of 6 weeks of
antibiotics. There should be a cautious examination for septic emboli or
metastatic infections, particularly endocarditis and osteomyelitis.
Occasionally, fistula resection is required.
Hemodynamic complications:
Limb ischemia as a result of a steal syndrome is an important
complication of vascular access.9
Patients with mild symptoms, such as coldness or paresthesias, can be
followed conservatively.
Pain and poor wound healing require surgical evaluation and
motor/sensory loss is considered a surgical emergency.
The high flows through vascular access may also be problematic for
patients with cardiovascular disease. High output failure may be
exacerbated due to the placement of an AVG and may require ligation to
restore hemodynamic stability.
Aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms:
Aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms can develop in fistulas and grafts,
stimulated by the trauma of repetitive cannulation. Generally, these can
be managed with observation and by avoiding cannulation at the site of
aneurysmal dilation.
556

However, in patients who demonstrate rapid growth of the aneurysm,
poor eschar formation, or spontaneous bleeding, surgical evaluation
should be made urgently. Rupture of an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm
can result in prompt exsanguination and imminent death.
Complications of Urea Clearance
Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome occurs in response to an acute
reduction of uremic solutes in patients with chronic kidney disease.
This is typically seen after the initiation of dialysis, when aggressive
treatment prescriptions result in a rapid reduction of uremic solutes. Cells
that have accommodated to the uremic milieu may not be able to rapidly
respond to the dramatic osmolal change, resulting in symptoms of
dialysis disequilibrium.10
The syndrome may manifest with nausea, restlessness, confusion, or, in
the most serious cases, seizure and coma.
Prevention consists of limiting the first dialysis treatment to a reduction
in urea of no more than 30% in order to avoid a dramatic shift in solute
concentration.
Uremia also contributes to nausea, malnutrition, and pruritus.
The differential for these symptoms is broad, but special attention should
be paid to the adequacy of dialysis.
Pruritus may also result from concurrent disorders of mineral
metabolism, particularly the deposition of mineral salts and
hyperphosphatemia.
Adherence to dietary restriction, compliance with phosphorus binders,
and control of the parathyroid–bone–mineral axis are required.
Symptoms of pruritus may also be amenable to diphenhydramine or
other antihistamines, although oral administration is preferred because of
the addictive potential of IV diphenhydramine.
557

Skin Lesions
Calcific uremic arteriolopathy, previously known as calciphylaxis, is
caused by arteriolar mineralization and subsequent tissue ischemia.
A number of factors that are thought to promote the underlying process
of ectopic mineralization have been reported, including elevated
phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels and the administration of
calcium-containing agents and the anticoagulant warfarin.
Lesions often begin as erythematous or subcutaneous nodular lesions
that can be very painful. Progression to poorly healing ulcerative lesions
is associated with a high mortality rate, especially when located
centrally.
Treatment options are limited, but proper wound care is crucial to avoid
infectious sequelae and subsequent amputations.
Once the diagnosis is made, calcium-based supplements, vitamin D
analogs, and warfarin should be stopped, while non–calcium-based
phosphorus binders are titrated for aggressive control of serum
phosphorus levels.11
Sodium thiosulfate, which improves the solubility of calcium, has been
used with variable success.12
In patients with refractory hyperparathyroidism or persistent
hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, parathyroidectomy can
considered, though this does not guarantee an improvement in wound
healing or a survival benefit.
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis:
This is a newly recognized condition characterized by progressive fibrosis
and induration of skin, as well as other soft tissues. It tends to progress
proximally, resulting in joint contractures and progressive immobility.
Lesions typically have a “woody” texture. As of yet, there are no curative
options.
558

Cumulative exposure to gadolinium contrast agents have been associated
with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and thus should be
avoided, if possible, in patients with ESRD.13 If such a contrast study is
necessary, most agree that immediate HD after contrast exposure is
warranted.14
Dialyzer Reactions
Type A reactions:
Characterized by severe dyspnea, pruritus, abdominal cramping, and
angioedema occur in the first 30 min of treatment.
They have previously been attributed to ethylene oxide used in device
sterilization, contaminated dialysate, latex allergy, and bradykinins,
particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
in conjunction with exposure to the AN69 dialysis membrane.15
Treatment of suspected type A reactions includes cessation of dialysis,
diphenhydramine (25 mg IV for pruritus), oxygen as needed, and 200 mL
normal saline if hypotensive. Blood should not be returned.
To prevent subsequent reactions, an alternate sterilant may be tried, and
dialyzers should be thoroughly rinsed before use.
Type B reactions:
These are characterized by mild back pain and chest pain and occur in
the first hour of dialysis.
One may attempt to treat through symptoms with supplemental oxygen
and antihistamine therapy as needed. Symptoms should diminish during
the remainder of therapy.
As the etiology of type B reactions is uncertain, methods for prevention
are also uncertain, although trial of an alternate membrane may help.
Cardiovascular Complications
559

Cardiovascular disease is by far the largest cause of mortality in patients
with ESRD. As patients are at great cardiovascular risk, chest pain should
not be treated lightly in the dialysis units.
Although a high suspicion for coronary disease should be maintained, a
broad differential should be considered, including musculoskeletal causes,
dialyzer reactions, reflux disease, and pulmonary edema.
In suspected angina, patients should be placed on nasal oxygen,
ultrafiltration should be held, an ECG should be obtained, and
nitroglycerin should be considered if tolerated by the blood pressure. If
chest pain persists, dialysis should be discontinued and further work up
afforded.
Both hypotension and hypertension are commonly seen in patients on
dialysis.
Hypotension may be a product of excessive volume removal, and
ultrafiltration should be stopped with saline return administered as
necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability. However, it is also
important to rule out cardiovascular etiologies as well as infection or
sepsis.
Febrile patients who develop hypotension during dialysis treatments
should have blood cultures drawn and empiric antibiotics dosed after
treatment.
The management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease
is discussed elsewhere in this book.

Peritoneal Dialysis
Seth Goldberg

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a form of renal replacement therapy that
utilizes the patient’s natural peritoneum as a semipermeable membrane
between the blood and an infused dialysis solution.
It was observed almost a century ago that solutes equilibrate across the
peritoneal membrane, and this discovery paved the way for PD in the
treatment of renal failure.
With technical advancements over the ensuing decades, PD has become a
viable option for patients with end-stage renal disease; however, it
remains underused in the United States, with only 10% to 15% of dialysis
patients on PD as opposed to hemodialysis (HD).
As compared to HD, actual treatment costs of PD are similar; however,
the overall cost of care is higher for HD when vascular access
complications are factored.
Patients on PD require fewer hospitalizations and shorter durations of
stay.
Although neither dialysis modality offers a survival advantage over the
other, greater satisfaction and convenience are qualities frequently
promoted by patients on PD as compared to those on HD.
Physiology
Diffusion:

563

Most solute removal in PD occurs by diffusion.
Substances retained in renal failure (urea, creatinine, potassium,
phosphorus) are present in higher concentrations in the blood and thus
travel down the gradient into the dialysis solution.
Dextrose, which is present in high concentrations in the dialysis solution,
diffuses inwardly.
The alkaline equivalent, usually lactate, also diffuses inwardly,
correcting the metabolic acidosis present in renal failure.
Ultrafiltration:
This is the process by which excess water is removed from the body.
As opposed to HD, where hydrostatic pressure pulls off excess water, in
PD an osmotic gradient causes water to shift from the blood to the
relatively hyperosmolar dialysis solution.
The hyperosmolar gradient is produced most commonly by the high
dextrose concentration in the dialysis solution.
Absorption:
Absorption is the reuptake of water and the dissolved solutes in bulk
through the lymphatics of the abdominal wall.
This counteracts their removal making PD less efficient.
Increased abdominal pressure (such as a sitting posture or the standing
position) favors absorption.
Patient Selection
Success of PD depends primarily on appropriate patient selection.
Patients need to be highly motivated and capable of performing regular
treatments within their home environment, without direct supervision of
564

a trained medical specialist.
Patients who prefer PD over HD tend to be more independent, as the
flexible schedule is more conducive to employment and travel as
compared to the rigid schedule of in-center HD.
Some relative and absolute contraindications for PD include:
The presence of uncorrectable mechanical defects (irreparable
abdominal hernia)
A recent abdominal operation (including aortic vascular graft)
Frequent diverticulitis and/or other intraabdominal infections and
pathology
Abdominal wall cellulitis
A history of repeated abdominal operations with adhesion formation
Patients who are physically unable to perform their own exchanges and
who lack a suitable caregiver at home.
Apparatus
Catheter and setup:
Most centers use a two-cuff silastic Tenckhoff catheter.
The intraabdominal portion contains many side-port perforations to
maximize fluid flow.
Surgically placed, the catheter should have a break-in period of 10 to 14
days prior to initiation to reduce the incidence of early leaks or infection.
The deep cuff is stitched to the abdominal wall musculature and secures
the catheter in its position.
The superficial cuff allows for granulation tissue to form, creating a
barrier to infection; however, externalization of this cuff may occur and
565

does not signify catheter migration.
Tunneled presternal catheters are associated with reduced infectious
complications in obese patients.
The Y-set is the standard setup in manual PD (Fig. 26-1).1

FIGURE 26-1. The Y-set for peritoneal dialysis (PD), with
demonstration of the “flush-before-fill” technique.

Infection risk is reduced as there is only one connection point (at the
stem emerging from the patient) where sterile technique may
accidentally be ​broken.
The flush-before-fill technique is where the patient first flushes air out of
the tubing by allowing a small amount of dialysis solution to pass into
the drain bag; the drain bag is then clamped and the rest of the dialysis
solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity via gravity (10 to 15
minutes).
566

Between exchanges, the bags are disconnected and the stem is capped.
When the specified dwell time is complete, a new transfer set is attached
and the peritoneal cavity is drained via gravity (20 to 25 minutes) before
a new infusion is started, again with the flush-before-fill technique.
It is generally recommended that the catheter should not be submerged
in water.
Dialysis solution:
Standard PD solutions contain sodium, chloride, lactate, magnesium,
calcium, and varying concentrations of dextrose (Table 26-1).

Most commercial solutions contain a sodium concentration of 132 mEq/L
to allow a small amount of sodium to move out from the blood; this
protects against hypernatremia that might otherwise occur, particularly
with the more hypertonic solutions.
Potassium is not present in standard solutions.
Phosphorus is also absent, but removal by PD is not efficient and is
usually unable to fully remove the daily dietary load.
In the present era of wide-spread calcium-containing phosphorus
binders, a PD solution with a lower calcium concentration (2.5 mEq/L) is
preferred.
Lactate has been the primary alkaline equivalent used in PD because of
technical difficulty with bicarbonate in the manufacturing process; the
resultant acidic pH of 5.5 can cause inflow pain and may be damaging to
the ​mesothelium.
567

Newer dual-chamber bags with bicarbonate are available, allowing for
mixing at the time of use, although they have yet to become standard.
The hypertonicity that allows for ultrafiltration to occur is typically
created by dextrose in the solution.
The dextrose concentration can be 1.5%, 2.5%, or 4.25%, with the
higher concentrations providing a stronger osmotic force and a greater
degree of ultrafiltration.
Most commercially available solutions have color-coded tabs with which
patients may be more familiar rather than the actual percentage of
dextrose (Table 26-2).
A drawback of dextrose-containing solutions is that 60% to 80% can
diffuse inwardly during a dwell, thereby dissipating the osmotic gradient,
limiting the achieved ultrafiltration, and leading to the development of
metabolic complications.
Newer solutions with long-chain glucose polymers (icodextrin) allow for
a more sustained osmotic effect, equivalent to a 2.5% dextrose solution
over an 18-hour period; the icodextrin can lead to falsely elevated glucose
levels on some test strips and such results must be interpreted cautiously.
Amino acids can also be used as an osmotic agent, particularly in
malnourished patients, although frequent or long-term use may lead to a
metabolic acidosis and elevations in the serum urea concentration;
ultrafiltration capacity is limited, roughly equivalent to a 1.5% dextrose
solution.2
Peritoneal membrane:
The membrane separating the blood in the capillaries from the solution
in the peritoneal cavity consists of many layers.
Unstirred layer in the blood
Capillary endothelium
568

Capillary basement membrane
Interstitium
Peritoneal basement membrane
Peritoneal mesothelium
Unstirred layer in the peritoneal solution
Most resistance to solute movement occurs at the capillary endothelium
(via filtration pores) and interstitium (which may be of variable
thickness).
The total surface area in adults is ∼2 m2, consisting of both the parietal
and visceral layers; not all capillaries are readily available to participate
in solute exchange, as some may be too far from the cavity under
baseline conditions.
Larger dwell volumes can stretch the membrane, recruiting more
capillaries to participate in solute exchange; peritonitis increases the
vascularity of the membrane thus making the peritoneum leakier.
The “three-pore model” describes large pores (>25 nm) through which
proteins and other macromolecules pass, small pores (4 to 6 nm) for
electrolytes and solutes like urea and creatinine, and ultrasmall pores
(0.3 to 0.5 nm), which serve much like aquaporins allowing only solutefree water to pass, acting like a sieve.
The peritoneal cavity can typically accommodate 2 to 3 L of fluid
without discomfort or respiratory compromise.

569

Not all membranes are alike, and there is considerable amount of
patient-to-patient variability in the character of the peritoneal
membrane.
Four classes of membrane transport characteristics are defined based on
ease of creatinine diffusion (Table 26-3).
A peritoneal equilibration test (PET) allows one to determine the type
of membrane a patient possesses and then tailor the PD prescription to
maximize efficiency.
A 2-L infusion of 2.5% dextrose solution is allowed to dwell for 4 hours.
The dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine is calculated.
Higher values correlate with better solute diffusion and clearance;
however, the osmotic gradient is also more rapidly lost, limiting
ultrafiltration.
The Canada–USA (CANUSA) Study Group found a greater risk of
technique failure or death in patients with high transport membranes
undergoing manual exchanges; the underlying mechanism for this
increased risk is thought to involve poor ultrafiltration (with resultant
hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy) and increased protein
losses.3
Modalities and Prescription
570

Manual exchanges:
Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) involves
patient-​operated manual exchanges performed throughout the day.
Fluid volumes of 2 to 3 L are typical, with dwell times each ranging from
6 to 8 hours.
Most patients are first educated and trained in CAPD prior to learning
other modalities, as this can be used as a backup or emergency modality
in the event of a power outage or machine malfunction.
Patients admitted to the hospital overnight can resort to CAPD if nurse
staffing or machine availability is limited.
A sample prescription would be 2 L of 2.5% dextrose solution with four
exchanges of ∼6 hours each (or can be unevenly spaced at more
convenient times of the day such as awakening, noon, dinner, and
bedtime, with the longest dwell overnight).
Automated cycler exchanges:
In continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), also known as
automated PD, the patient undergoes automated exchanges overnight,
with three or more relatively short cycles.
The final exchange remains in the peritoneal cavity on awakening, and
the patient disconnects from the machine and is free to go about doing
daily activities.
The “continuous” label in the name of this modality refers to the retained
daytime dwell that allows for solute transfer to occur around the clock.
An extra manual exchange is sometimes added during the day if
clearance or ultrafiltration targets are not reached.
A sample prescription would have four dwells of 2 hours each, with 2.5 L
of 2.5% dextrose solution, and a final fill (daytime dwell) of 2 L of
icodextrin prior to disconnecting.
571

Prescriptions:
In choosing a PD modality, the patient’s membrane type should be
known, as determined from the results of the PET.
Those with high transport membranes dissipate their osmotic
gradients more rapidly, and short repeated dwells may be required to
achieve adequate ultrafiltration (bringing in fresh hypertonic solution);
these patients fare better on CCPD.
Those with low transport membranes have difficulty with solute
diffusion and would benefit from the long, evenly spaced dwells of
CAPD.
Patients with either high-average or low-average membranes can usually
achieve adequate solute removal and ultrafiltration with either modality;
thus selection can generally depend on patient preference.
Adequacy of PD
Clearance targets:
The 2006 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI)
guidelines recommend a weekly clearance of urea (Kt/Vurea) of at
least 1.7, reflecting combined contribution from PD and residual renal
function in patients producing >100 mL of urine per day.
Clearance adequacy should be measured within the first month after
initiating therapy, then at 4-month intervals unless there has been a
change in the prescription or in the clinical status of the patient.
The clearance is calculated from the 24-hour Kt/Vurea shown below,

where VD is the total volume of dialysate used (in L), Durea is the dialysate
urea ​concentration, Purea is the plasma urea concentration, and Vurea is

the estimated volume (in L) of distribution of urea (total body water or
from Watson or Hume formulae).
24-hour Kt/Vurea = (VD)(Durea)/(Purea)(Vurea)
572

The 24-hour Kt/Vurea is then multiplied by 7 for the weekly clearance.
Residual renal function is calculated with the same equation, substituting
urine values for VD and Durea, then multiplied by 7 and added to the
dialysate clearance.

Note the similarity of this equation to the generic UV/P clearance
equation.
Protection of residual renal function is important in the PD
population, with avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast as
much as possible; the adequacy of PD in Mexico (ADEMEX) study showed
a statistically significant association between loss of residual renal
function and death.4
Improved clearance can be achieved by increasing the amount of dialysis
solution used over the 24-hour period; for example, this can be achieved
by adding an extra exchange or by using larger dwell volumes.
However, there are diminishing returns, as more time is “lost” draining
and filling the peritoneal cavity or when larger volumes increase the
intraabdominal pressure such that the balance is tilted toward more fluid
reabsorption by the lymphatics.
Ultrafiltration targets:
Ultrafiltration targets are less clearly defined than clearance, although a
minimum of 750 mL of net fluid removal per day has been associated
with better outcomes in anuric patients.5
To enhance ultrafiltration, a higher dextrose concentration can be used
(4.25% solution); shorter dwell times (particularly in patients with leaky
high transport membranes) can also aid in increasing ultrafiltration.
In volume overloaded patients, restricting sodium and water may help,
as may administering diuretics in patients making urine.
Ultrafiltration failure is a term used to describe a condition of fluid
573

overload in association with net ultrafiltration of <400 mL after a 4-hour
dwell of 2 L of 4.25% dextrose; this can be the result of rapid loss of the
osmotic gradient (high transporters), decreased peritoneal membrane
water permeability (peritonitis, fibrosis, adhesions), or from increased
reabsorption by the ​lymphatics.
Failure of adequate ultrafiltration may necessitate a switch to HD.

COMPLICATIONS
Infectious Complications
Peritonitis:
Table 26-4 describes some of the common signs and symptoms found of
peritonitis in PD patients.
Peritonitis remains a common and potentially serious complication in
the PD population.
Although many cases can be treated in the out-patient setting, recurrent
episodes threaten the long-term integrity of the peritoneal membrane.
Most common causes include inadvertent breaks in sterile technique,
migration of pathogens from the catheter site, or transvisceral passage of
bacteria from gut pathology such as diverticulitis.
Presentation can be subtle, but the most common features are cloudy
peritoneal fluid, abdominal pain, and/or fever.
For diagnosis, the spent dialysis solution should be evaluated by Gram
stain, culture (preferably prior to antibiotics), and white blood cell
count with differential; a white blood cell count >100 cells per mm3,
of which at least 50% are polymorphonuclear neutrophils, is supportive
of the diagnosis.
The International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis has recommended
empiric therapy using a combination of a first-generation
cephalosporin (cefazolin or cephalothin) with ceftazidime.
574

Routine use of aminoglycoside therapy is NOT recommended in PD
patients, in order to preserve residual renal function.6
In most cases, intraperitoneal dosing is the preferred route of
antibiotic therapy; when patients are bacteremic or overtly septic,
intravenous antibiotics should be administered instead.

Suggested intraperitoneal doses for selected antibiotics are listed in
Table 26-5; the intermittent dosing schedule refers to the antibiotic being
added only to the longest dwell (nighttime fill for CAPD, daytime dwell
for CCPD).
575

Treatment strategies that are available after the results of the Gram stain
and culture are obtained are outlined in Table 26-6.
Gram-positive infections can frequently be treated with a single
antibiotic agent, tailored once the sensitivities are known.
Infections with Pseudomonas species are particularly difficult to
eradicate and a second antibiotic to which it is sensitive is recommended;
in up to two-thirds of cases, catheter removal may become necessary.
Fungal peritonitis can lead to rapid deterioration and immediate
catheter removal is almost always mandatory along with anti-fungal
agents; close monitoring in the in-patient setting is typically
recommended for this ​situation.
A polymicrobial or anaerobic infection suggests an abdominal abscess or
perforation, requiring urgent imaging or surgical exploration.
Exit-site and tunnel infection:
Catheter site infections are suspected if erythema or exudates are
present externally; crust formation at the exit site, however, does not
necessarily indicate infection, and positive wound cultures in the absence
of other symptoms may simply indicate colonization.
Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of exit-site infections.
As with peritonitis, the Gram stain and culture are helpful in guiding
antibiotic therapy.
Gram-positive organisms can be treated with an oral cephalosporin or
penicillinase-resistant antibiotic; resistant strains may require
vancomycin and rifampin.
Gram-negative organisms can usually be treated with oral
ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid); with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, addition of
ceftazidime or an aminoglycoside may become necessary, as well as
catheter removal.
576

For infections that respond to therapy, antibiotics can be discontinued
after 2 weeks; relapsing infections or those that progress to tunnel
infections or peritonitis may necessitate catheter removal.

Meticulous exit-site care is essential to prevent such infections, with
hand washing for 2 minutes before manipulating the catheter dressings;
daily application of 0.1% gentamicin cream has been shown to be
effective in reducing the incidence of exit-site infections with
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Catheter anchorage with tape and gauze dressings helps to prevent exitsite trauma.
Vigorous scrubbing at the exit-site or prolonged submersion into
water should be avoided.
Mechanical Complications
Outflow failure:
Outflow failure is defined as a drain volume that is consistently and
577

substantially less than the volume being infused in the absence of an
obvious fluid leak.
Common causes include kinking of the catheter, constipation,
adhesion formation, or fibrin plugging.
Tracking of fluid along the abdominal wall can cause an apparent
outflow failure and may manifest as scrotal edema.
A systematic approach can be used to investigate and correct the
problem:
Check a plain film of the abdomen to evaluate the course of the catheter,
which should ideally be directed toward the pelvis to avoid contact with
the omentum.
Constipation should be treated aggressively and can resolve ∼50%
of cases of outflow failure (mechanism unclear); magnesium and
phosphate products should be avoided in the treatment of
constipation in end-stage renal disease. Lactulose is an acceptable choice.
Heparin can be added to the PD solution (250 to 500 units/L), especially
if fibrin strands are evident in the discarded fluid; heparin is not
systemically absorbed from the peritoneal cavity, thus minimizing the
risk of anticoagulation.
Thrombolytic agents (tissue plasminogen activator, 1 mg/mL for 1 hour)
may also help break up fibrin strands.
If these conservative measures fail to correct the problem, surgical
consultation with catheter repositioning or replacement may be
necessary.
Back pain:
In the PD population, the infused solution causes a shift in the center of
gravity, producing excess stress on the lumbar spine.
Management includes bed rest in the acute situation, along with
578

decreasing the volume of the dwells.
A concomitant increase in the number of exchanges may be needed to
maintain adequate solute clearance.
When applicable, physical therapy with muscle-strengthening exercises
may help alleviate symptoms.
Hernias:
Abdominal hernias develop in 10% to 20% of PD patients, resulting
from the increased intraabdominal pressure created by the infused fluid.
Risk factors include large-volume dwells, a sitting position during dwell
carriage, obesity, and multiparity; any condition that weakens the
abdominal musculature, such as deconditioning, can also pose a risk for
hernia formation.
Diagnosis is clinical and treatment is typically with surgical repair.
Small abdominal hernias carry the greatest risk of bowel incarceration,
which can present with worsening abdominal pain and loss of
reducibility at the hernia site.
After surgical repair, intraabdominal pressures must be kept as low as
possible to facilitate healing; patients with good residual renal function
may be able to discontinue PD for 1 week, then gradually reinitiate with
small volumes (1 L exchanges) for another week.
Supine dialysis also helps to reduce the intraabdominal pressure.
Patients with little residual renal function may need to temporarily
switch to HD until the wound is completely healed.
Fluid leakage:
Risk factors for fluid leakage are similar to those for hernia formation.
Early leaks are those that occur within 1 month of catheter placement
579

and typically occur at the exit site.
Late leaks can extend into the subcutaneous tissue or into the pleural
space (hydrothorax), presenting more subtly with weight gain, shortness
of breath, or apparent outflow failure.
Hydrothoraces are almost exclusively found on the right side, as the left
hemidiaphragm has additional coverage by the heart and pericardium; a
diagnostic thoracentesis reveals markedly elevated glucose levels when
the pleural fluid originates from the peritoneal solution.
Treatment of fluid leakage entails draining the peritoneal cavity dry for
24 to 48 hours; if the leak recurs, longer periods off PD may be needed
with temporary support on HD.
A hydrothorax that is symptomatic requires medical or surgical
pleurodesis.
Genital edema is a specific form of fluid leakage that can occur via a
patent processus vaginalis that results in a hydrocele; this can also occur
through a defect in the abdominal wall at the catheter site, allowing fluid
to track down through subcutaneous tissue.
As with abdominal hernias, reduction in the intraabdominal pressure
with small-volume or supine PD may alleviate the symptoms; anatomical
defects, however, may need to be corrected surgically.
Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis:
Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is an uncommon clinical entity
where a fibrous transformation of the peritoneal membrane entraps
loops of bowel causing symptoms of intestinal obstruction, with nausea,
vomiting, and anorexia.
A bloody dialysis fluid drainage may alert the physician to this
problem.
The incidence is ∼2.5% and is more common in patients receiving longterm PD (>5 to 8 years); it can even occur after patients have previously
580

discontinued PD.
Although the mechanism is not clearly defined, chemical irritation of the
peritoneal membrane is suspected as the inciting event. Recurrent bouts
of peritonitis have also been implicated as a risk factor.
Treatment options are limited, consisting of bowel rest and surgical
lysis of adhesions when obstruction occurs.
Immunosuppression with prednisone in doses ranging from 10 to 40
mg/d have shown modest benefit and case series using tamoxifen (20 mg
bid) have shown success.7,8
The overall prognosis of patients with sclerosing encapsulating
peritonitis is poor, with a 1-year mortality rate >50%.
Metabolic Complications
Hyperglycemia:
As much as 75% of the dextrose in the dialysis solution may diffuse
inwardly to the blood, particularly in patients with leaky high transport
membranes.
Patients with underlying diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance are
most susceptible to this complication.
The calories provided by the dextrose account for much of the 5% to 10%
weight gain frequently observed in the first year on PD.
Hyperlipidemia:
An atherogenic lipid profile is frequently encountered in patients on PD.
The inward diffusion of dextrose results in elevated triglycerides, as
well as the elevation in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein
(LDL); smaller proteins, such as high-density lipoprotein, are lost in the
spent dialysate further increasing cardiovascular risk.

581

Treatment is focused on dietary modification, exercise, and HMGcoenzyme A reductase inhibitors as first-line medical therapy.
Specific LDL cholesterol targets in PD patients have not been defined,
and in the absence of established coronary disease or coronary disease
equivalents, the accepted target is <100 mg/dL.
Protein loss and malnutrition:
Protein loss of ∼0.5 g/L of drainage occurs in PD, and the rate of loss
may be even greater in patients with high transport membranes.
The major protein lost is albumin.
Factors that increase membrane permeability, such as peritonitis, can
significantly magnify the rate of protein loss.
The KDOQI guidelines recommend a dietary protein intake of 1.2 to
1.3 g/kg/d for PD patients.
Hypokalemia:
Approximately one-third of PD patients experience hypokalemia.
Patients are typically in a negative potassium balance, as standard PD
solutions lack this electrolyte, and increased endogenous insulin release
(stimulated by the sugar load) leads to an intracellular potassium shift.
Poor nutritional status in hospitalized patients (particularly when placed
on a low-potassium “renal diet”) may further exacerbate hypokalemia.
With mild hypokalemia, it is recommended that patients liberalize their
potassium intake, or oral supplements are initiated.
In severe hypokalemia, addition of potassium to the PD solution may be
required.
Indications for Change to HD

582

Despite the safety and effectiveness of PD, patients are sometimes
required to switch to HD temporarily or permanently.
Common reasons for a permanent switch include:
Consistent failure to achieve adequacy targets (Kt/Vurea <1.7)
Inadequate fluid removal (ultrafiltration failure)
Severe hypertriglyceridemia that is resistant to therapy
Frequent peritonitis or other infectious complications
Irreparable mechanical problems, including sclerosis encapsulating
peritonitis
Severe protein malnutrition resistant to aggressive management
Patients may occasionally require a temporary switch to HD for the
following reasons:
Surgical operations involving the peritoneal cavity (e.g., perforated
ulcer, bowel obstruction, rarely renal cell cancers)
Peritoneal fluid leaks
Infectious complications requiring temporary catheter removal
The presence of a PD catheter does not preclude renal transplantation,
and the catheter can be surgically removed at the time of transplantation
or at a later date.
As with other forms of renal replacement therapy, the leading causes of
death for patients on PD are cardiovascular disease and infections.
A statistically significant association between the loss of residual renal
function and mortality has been described, stressing the importance of
preserving kidney function whenever possible.

Principles of Drug Dosing in Renal
Impairment
Lyndsey Bowman and Jennifer Iuppa

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Deciding on the appropriate dosing strategy of medications in patients
with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) require
an understanding of the basic principles of pharmacokinetics, including
absorption, protein binding, metabolism, and elimination.
Many drugs and their metabolites are renally eliminated and require
special consideration when prescribed to patients with impaired renal
function.1
Renal impairment affects glomerular blood flow and filtration, tubular
secretion, reabsorption, renal bioactivation, and metabolism. Both
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of medications are
altered.
One of the most important drug-related problems in patients with renal
impairment is inappropriate medication dosing. Errors are common,
often overlooked, and may lead to toxicity or ineffective therapy. These
errors are preventable. One study estimated that as many as 40% of
patients with CKD stages 3 to 5, received dosages on average 2.5 times
higher than the recommended upper limit of the dosing range.2
Dosing for medications that undergo renal elimination is based primarily
on an estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Kidney Disease
Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommends the Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation.
585

Caution should be used when estimating GFR in older patients, as
decreased creatinine production and excretion as a function of old age
may lead to overestimation of GFR.
Patient-specific dosages calculated using these equations should only be
conducted in the presence of stable renal function.
Drugs that can further impair renal function in high-risk patients
(underlying CKD, heart failure (HF), liver disease, hypoperfusion) should
be used with caution or avoided altogether in preference for safer
alternatives. Appendices A and B lists medications that are potentially
nephrotoxic and suggests safer alternatives in the setting of renal
impairment.

PHARMACOKINETICS
Pharmacokinetics refers to the action of drugs in the body over time, and
is used to understand drug handling as a means to optimize efficacy and
minimize toxicity. It is based on four parameters of drug activity:
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and clearance.
In patients with renal impairment, the pharmacokinetic profile of many
commonly prescribed medications is altered. To optimize drug usage and
preserve patient safety, it is necessary to understand these effects.3,4
Absorption
Intestinal absorption and bioavailability (the fraction of medication that
reaches systemic circulation) are influenced by many variables and are
the result of numerous physiologic processes.
Patients with CKD and AKI exhibit changes in the gastrointestinal tract
that affect bioavailability.
Renal Failure-Induced Changes
Gastroparesis: Patients with CKD often suffer from gastroparesis. This
results in delayed gastric emptying and prolongs the time to maximum
586

drug concentrations (Cmax). The overall extent of absorption is not

commonly affected, but delayed Cmax can be important when rapid onset
of action is desired.

Gastric alkalinization: As a result of the common use of medications,
including phosphate binders, antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, and

proton pump inhibitors, the absorption of many medications requiring an
acidic environment (e.g., furosemide and ferrous sulfate) is reduced.
Cationic chelation: Ingestion of cation-containing antacids (e.g.,
calcium, magnesium, aluminum hydroxide, sodium polystyrene sulfonate)
decreases the absorption of many coadministered medications because of
chelation (quinolone antibiotics, warfarin, levothyroxine, tetracycline,
and so forth).
Alterations to intestinal first-pass metabolism and p-glycoprotein efflux
system:
Many medications are subject to intestinal metabolism by the
cytochrome P450 enzyme system.
In CKD, reductions in metabolism occur and, in animal studies, they
have been estimated to result in a 30% decrease in function.
p-Glycoprotein, an efflux transport protein in the intestinal tract, also
exhibits decreased activity.
Increased medication bioavailability occurs as a result of both of these
changes.
Two medications with narrow therapeutic index (TI) affected by these
variations are cyclosporine and tacrolimus.
Distribution
Drug distribution or volume of distribution (Vd) is the total amount of

drug present in the body, divided by the plasma concentration, expressed
587

in liters.
The Vd determines peak concentrations. Plasma protein binding, tissue

binding, active transport, and body composition can all impact the Vd.
Alterations in protein binding can affect drug concentrations by
changing the ratio of free to bound medication.
Plasma drug concentrations are representative of both bound and
unbound drug, but only free drug is capable of crossing cellular
membranes and exerting pharmacologic effects.
Renal Failure-Induced Changes
Altered protein binding:

Hypoalbuminemia due to the nephrotic syndrome often leads to an
increase in the free drug fraction of medications that are highly bound to
albumin.
Acidic drugs (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, phenytoin, furosemide,
salicylates) are those that are predominantly affected and can lead to
drug-related toxicities.
Alternatively, an increase in α1-glycoprotein (an acute phase protein)
associated with renal dysfunction will lead to increase in protein binding
of ​medications bound to nonalbumin proteins.
Alkaline drugs (e.g., propranolol, morphine, oxazepam, vancomycin,
and so forth) are affected by this phenomenon and thus plasma drug
concentrations are decreased.
In addition, accumulation of metabolites and endogenous substances
increase competition for binding sites (e.g., digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin,
valproic acid, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).
A classic example is phenytoin.
588

Traditionally, total plasma phenytoin levels were followed.
In uremia, many toxins accumulate and can displace phenytoin from
albumin.
Therefore, although the total drug level could still be therapeutic, the
free (unbound) or effective drug level may exceed the therapeutic range.
The unbound or free plasma concentration should always be measured in
addition to total concentrations.
Qualitative changes to these binding sites can also occur, resulting in
decreased drug-binding affinity.
Altered tissue binding: Changes in tissue binding are most often
irrelevant except for digoxin, in which the Vd is reduced by 50% in stage
5 CKD.

Changes in body composition: Fluid retention can increase the Vd of

hydrophilic drugs (e.g., pravastatin, fluvastatin, morphine, codeine) and
may cause decreased serum concentrations; whereas increased adipose
tissue and muscle wasting would be expected to increase serum
concentrations secondary to a reduced Vd.
Metabolism
The majority of drugs in the clinical setting undergo first-order kinetics
(drug concentrations decline logarithmically over time) and rates are
proportional to the total body concentration of drug present.5
There are numerous sites in the body in which metabolism occurs,
primarily intestine, liver, and kidneys.
Biotransformation at these sites happens through one of two phases of
reactions:
Phase I reactions (more common) include hydrolysis, reduction, and
oxidation. These serve to increase drug hydrophilicity to prepare for
589

excretion or further phase II metabolism.
Phase II reactions or conjugation reactions include glucuronidation,
sulfation, glutathione conjugation, acetylation, and methylation.
Renal Failure-Induced Changes
Altered biotransformation:
Renal insufficiency significantly slows both phase I and phase II
reactions.
Changes to oxidation reactions result in reduced activity of several of the
CYP450 isoenzymes (2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4).
All phase II reactions are slowed affecting acetylation (dapsone,
hydralazine, isoniazid, procainamide), glucuronidation
(acetaminophen, morphine, lorazepam, oxazepam, naproxen), sulfation
(acetaminophen, minoxidil, dopamine, albuterol), and methylation
(dobutamine, dopamine, 6-mercaptopurine).
The resultant effect is increased serum drug concentrations.
Accumulation of renally excreted active metabolites: Dosage
adjustments may be necessary for certain medications in order to prevent
toxicity from active metabolites.6 (See Appendix C: Common Medications
with Active Metabolites.)
Elimination
Elimination is typically reported as a half-life (T½), or the time needed
to reduce medication plasma concentrations by 50%.
Approximately five half-lives are required to eliminate 97% of drug
from the body.
This parameter is especially useful for estimation of the time required to
achieve steady state (approximately four to five half-lives), and to
estimate appropriate drug dosing intervals.
590

The rate of renal elimination is dependent on GFR, renal tubular
secretion, and reabsorption.
Medication-specific characteristics (e.g., molecular weight and protein
binding) determine glomerular filtration with filtration rate dependent
on free fraction.
Drugs that are highly protein bound are not filtered, but instead actively
secreted into the proximal convoluted tubule through a saturable process.
In the distal portion of the nephron, substantial passive reabsorption
occurs.
This process is affected by urine concentrating activities, pH,
lipophilicity, and protein binding.
Renal Failure-Induced Changes
Reduced glomerular filtration: Decreased GFR results in prolonged free
drug elimination T½.
Reduced secretion by active transport (e.g., ampicillin, furosemide,
penicillin G, dopamine, trimethoprim).
Reduced passive reabsorption (e.g., aspirin, lithium).

DOSAGE ADJUSTMENTS OF COMMONLY USED DRUGS
In general, renal insufficiency makes it difficult to predict whether a
medication dose will produce an adequate, supratherapeutic, or
subtherapeutic effect.7
Loading doses, used to rapidly achieve a therapeutic drug
concentration, do not typically need to be altered.
An important exception to this rule is digoxin. In the presence of renal
impairment, the Vd of digoxin is dramatically reduced, requiring on
average a 50% dose reduction. Physiologic determinants affecting
loading doses, such as an increase in total body water (in the case of
591

edema or ascites), may warrant a higher than normal loading dose to
account for change in Vd, whereas dehydration may require a loading

dose reduction. The following equation can be used to estimate the dose
required to achieve a specific serum concentration:
Loading dose = Vd × IBW × Cp
(Vd [L/kg]; IBW [ideal body weight; kg]; Cp [desired plasma

concentration; mg/L])

Maintenance doses are used to achieve steady-state concentrations.
Dose reduction, increasing the interval, or both can be used to avoid the
accumulation of renally eliminated drugs or their metabolites.
A strategy of dose reduction achieves more constant drug concentrations
with a higher risk of toxicity (inadequate time for drug elimination).
Extending the interval allows time for drug elimination between doses,
but is associated with a higher risk of subtherapeutic drug concentrations.
Anticoagulants
Warfarin metabolism is not significantly altered in renal insufficiency.
One study, however, has shown that compared to patients with no/mild
kidney impairment, those with moderate kidney impairment required
9.5% lower doses (P <0.001) and those with severe kidney impairment
required 19% lower doses (P <0.001).8
In addition, renal dysfunction puts patients at a higher risk of
hemorrhage, likely due to platelet dysfunction and drug interactions.
Low-molecular-weight heparins primarily undergo renal clearance
and require dose adjustment in renal failure.
Anti-Xa monitoring has been recommended in this population for GFRs
<30 mL/min (peak level to be drawn 4 hours postdose).
592

Similar to warfarin, the risk of hemorrhage is higher in patients with
renal insufficiency.
Bivalirudin, desirudin, and lepirudin are direct thrombin inhibitors
that are all renally eliminated and require dose adjustment.
Argatroban is not renally cleared and is the preferred agent in a patient
with renal insufficiency but without hepatic dysfunction.
Antihypertensive Agents and Diuretics
Thiazide diuretics, considered first-line therapy for uncomplicated
hypertension, are not recommended with serum creatinine (SCr) levels
that exceed
2.5 mg/dL or GFRs below 30 mL/min.
These agents require activity in the lumen of the nephron to produce a
natriuretic effect, which is not achieved with advanced renal impairment.
Acetazolamide should be avoided in stage 4 or 5 CKD because of
increased risk of metabolic acidosis.
Loop diuretics are the most commonly prescribed diuretics in patients
with renal impairment.
Their clearance is often decreased, but patients require higher doses to
achieve similar intraluminal concentrations.
This can lead to a higher risk of ototoxicity.
Drug resistance often occurs as a result of decreased drug delivery to the
nephron lumen, increased sodium reabsorption between dosages, and
increased distal sodium reabsorption.
Increasing the dose, switching to a continuous infusion, or adding a
thiazide diuretic to alter distal sodium absorption are strategies that can
be used to overcome resistance.
Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
593

The aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, has been shown to
reduce mortality in patients with severe HF and is commonly used for this
indication.
This agent should be used with caution in renal insufficiency after
several reports have documented severe life-threatening hyperkalemia
that can occur in patients treated with spironolactone for HF.
Risk factors for hyperkalemia include advanced age, diabetes, advanced
CKD, and worsening left ventricular ejection fraction.
In the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), there was a
2% incidence of severe hyperkalemia in the treatment arm, but this study
excluded patients with SCr values >2.5 mg/dL or a history of
hyperkalemia.
Amiloride and triamterene inhibit the epithelial sodium channel,
thereby increasing natriuresis with a potassium-sparing action.
They lack the indication for HF, but place patients at a similar risk of
hyperkalemia.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/Angiotensin-2 Receptor
Blockers
They are considered first-line therapy for patients with diabetes mellitus
and proteinuria or early CKD.
These agents have been shown to reduce proteinuria, slow progression of
kidney disease, and provide long-term cardiovascular protection.
They exert their effects through inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system, and cause efferent arteriolar dilation.
Many patients experience an acute decline in GFR >15% from baseline
with proportional elevations in SCr in the first week.
If the rise in SCr is <30%, these medications can be continued safely in
most patients, and can be expected to return to baseline in 4 to 6 weeks.
594

Common practice includes discontinuation of the angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) if the
SCr rises >30% or serum potassium is >5.6 mEq/L.
These agents may also be associated with a minor drop in hemoglobin,
which may become significant in the presence of anemia due to other
causes.
Few patients require discontinuation, and anemia is usually responsive to
erythropoietin therapy.
ACEIs in general require renal dose adjustment, whereas the ARBs are all
hepatically eliminated and no adjustment is necessary.
Patients with renal impairment are at an increased risk of developing
severe hyperkalemia or acute renal failure (<5% overall), with the
highest risk being in patients with diabetes or a history of hyperkalemia.
Electrolytes and renal function should be evaluated in the first 4 to 7
days after initiation or adjustment, and caution should be used with
concomitant agents that can cause nephrotoxicity or hyperkalemia (i.e.,
potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs).
β-Blockers
Hydrophilic β-blockers such as atenolol, bisoprolol, nadolol, acebutolol
are renally eliminated and require dose reduction with renal impairment.
There is no need for dose adjustment of metoprolol, propranolol, or
labetalol.
However, propranolol exhibits increased protein binding in CKD, leading
to less free drug and decreased effectiveness.
Calcium Channel Blockers
These are not renally cleared and there is no alteration of half-life with
renal insufficiency.
595

Nondihydropyridines (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) may be superior
because of their ability to limit proteinuria.
Hypoglycemic Agents
Metformin
This is 90% to 100% renally excreted and its use is not recommended
with:
Elevation of SCr >1.5 mg/dL in men or 1.4 mg/dL in women
Patients aged >80 years
Patients with severe congestive HF
Any scenario that can affect renal perfusion
These conditions increase the risk of severe, life-threatening lactic
acidosis.
Sulfonylureas
Several sulfonylureas, including glyburide, should be avoided in patients
with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Glyburide has an active metabolite that is renally
eliminated and accumulation can cause prolonged hypoglycemia.
Glipizide does not have an active metabolite and is safe for use in renal
insufficiency.
Insulin
Insulin is renally eliminated and all preparations require dose
reduction in renal failure.
Antimicrobials
Many antimicrobial agents are renally eliminated and require dose
adjustment.
596

Errors are common and place patients at increased risk of toxicity or
ineffectiveness.
Dose adjustments are complex and vary based on individual medication
and degree of renal dysfunction.
Appendices D and E lists common antimicrobial and antiretroviral agents
that require dose adjustment.
In-depth recommendations to dosing aminoglycosides and vancomycin
(two of the most common antimicrobials affecting renal function) are
discussed below.
Aminoglycosides
Aminoglycosides are one of the most common medications associated
with AKI. It has a very low TI.
It is completely filtered by the glomerulus and taken up by the proximal
tubular cells. The toxicity leads to acute tubular necrosis in the proximal
tubules. There are additional toxic effects as well.9
There are two available dosing strategies: traditional and extendedinterval (EI) dosing.
Traditional dosing:
Step 1: Calculate dosing weight. To calculate dosing weight (DW), the
patient’s actual body weight (ABW) must be compared with the patient’s
ideal body weight (IBW). Corrections need to be made if the patient is
obese. The following can be used to calculate these weights:
IBW male = 50 kg + 2.3 [height (in.) – 60]
IBW female = 45.5 kg + 2.3 [height (in.) – 60]
Obese DW = IBW + 0.4 (ABW – IBW)
The DW can now be calculated as follows:
If ABW >1.2 (IBW), then DW = obese DW
If IBW <ABW <1.2 (IBW), then DW = IBW
If IBW >ABW, then DW = ABW
597

Step 2: Calculate loading dose. Calculation of the loading dose is
based on DW. The dose may be lowered in patients with volume
depletion. Gentamicin dosing can vary based on the site of infection.
Step 3: Estimate creatinine clearance. Creatinine clearance can be
estimated using the Cockroft–Gault equation:

Step 4: Calculate maintenance dose. The maintenance dose is a
percentage of the loading dose (Table 27-1).
Step 5: Therapeutic drug monitoring. Obtain peak and trough
concentrations with the third maintenance dose. The preferred peak and
trough can be selected clinically, with consideration given to the site
and severity of infection, causative microorganism, minimum inhibitory
concentration, immunocompetency of the patient, and intent of therapy
(Table 27-2). Recheck the level whenever there is a change in dosing
regimen or change in renal function; recheck every 1 to 2 weeks if
duration of therapy is >2 weeks.
EI dosing:
EI dosing is equally effective and may be less toxic compared with
traditional, every 8 hour, dosing.
EI aminoglycosides take advantage of concentration-dependent killing
through high peak levels and the postantibiotic effect.
EI dosing is NOT recommended in the following situations, wherein
there might be alterations to renal perfusion and drug pharmacokinetics.
Pregnancy
Anasarca/severe congestive HF/liver failure
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal
598

dialysis

CKD or AKI with GFR <30 mL/min
Endocarditis
Cystic fibrosis
Mycobacterial infection
Extremes of age—elderly and infants
599

Burns covering >20% body surface area
Critically ill patients with hemodynamic instability
EI dosing protocol: Calculate the patient’s DW as outlined above. The
initial intravenous dosing regimen is as follows:
Gentamicin, 5 mg/kg DW (round to nearest 50 mg)
Tobramycin, 5 mg/kg DW (round to nearest 50 mg)
Amikacin, 15 mg/kg DW (round to nearest 100 mg)
For therapeutic drug monitoring, obtain a single, random drug level ∼8
to
12 hours after the initial dose. Determine the appropriate maintenance
dose according to Figure 27-1.10
Repeat drug level as necessary. For patients with impaired renal
function, estimated dosing intervals are provided in Table 27-3.
Dialysis patients:
Patients on dialysis should be dosed according to traditional
method for aminoglycosides.
Doses for gentamicin/tobramycin are 1.5 to 2 mg/kg (or 1 mg/kg if
using for synergy, for a gram-positive bacteremia, or a urinary tract
infection) and the amikacin dose is 7.5 mg/kg.
Monitoring random levels in dialysis patients is absolutely necessary,
and is strongly recommended to prevent potential toxicity and to avoid
inadequate treatment.
Random levels should be drawn immediately prior to the next dialysis
session.

600

FIGURE 27-1. Nomograms depicting maintenance dose schedules
for gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin.
Patients are given another dose when the trough level falls to <2 μg/mL
for gentamicin/tobramycin and <10 μg/mL for amikacin.
Usually, dosing can be scheduled every 48 hours for peritoneal dialysis,
every 24 to 48 hours for patients on continuous renal replacement
therapy (CRRT), and three times weekly for intermittent hemodialysis
(IHD).
Vancomycin
The typical dosing regimen is 10 to 15 mg/kg, every 12 hours, based
on actual body weight and renal function.
For patients with impaired renal function, estimate dosing intervals
601

according to Table 27-4. Patients on dialysis need specialized dosing
regimens as described below.

Frequent monitoring of vancomycin levels is indicated if concomitant
nephrotoxic or ototoxic agents are being used, if there is changing renal
function, suboptimal response to therapy, hemodynamic instability, or
extremes of body weight.
Trough levels (every 4 to 7 days) are recommended in patients
receiving longer courses of therapy (>5 days) to ensure that
concentrations are adequate but not excessive.
Vancomycin levels are not recommended for patients receiving a short
course of therapy (<5 days).
Levels should be obtained at steady state or immediately before
administration of the third maintenance dose.
Desired trough levels are three times the minimum inhibitory
concentration, with 10 to 15 mg/L for skin and soft tissue infections.
Higher trough levels of 15 to 20 mg/L are recommended for
bloodstream, bone, lung, or central nervous system infections.
Peak levels should not be routinely obtained.
Dialysis patients:
Dosing frequency depends on the clearance of the dialyzer being used
and residual renal function.
602

With the newer high-clearance dialyzers, a significant amount of the
drug may be cleared after a dialysis session, leading to suboptimal drug
levels until the next scheduled dose.
Traditional concepts of “dose and forget” regimens for vancomycin are
not applicable with the newer dialyzers, and patients may need to be
dosed as frequently as every third to fifth day.

Thus, at least initially, attention must be directed toward ensuring that
trough levels define a dosage interval if prolonged therapy is planned.
The usual practice is to redose at a level of <15 mg/L (random or
predialysis).
A common regimen for vancomycin in hemodialysis patients using highflux membrane dialyzers is to give a 1 g loading dose at initiation of
therapy, ​followed by supplementary doses of 500 to 1000 mg after each
subsequent dialysis.
One should check a predialysis vancomycin level before the third or
fourth dialysis treatment on this regimen or sooner in critically ill
patients.
Patients on CRRT need frequent monitoring of drug level (daily or every
other day) and doses should be given every 12 hours.
Analgesics
NSAIDs and COX-2 Inhibitors
NSAIDs are used daily by one in five Americans and are generally safe
603

with a small risk of mild complications (e.g., peripheral edema or
increased blood pressure).
Patients with renal insufficiency, however, are at higher risk of
development of more serious side effects such as:
Worsening fluid overload and HF
Uncontrolled hypertension
AKI
Hyponatremia
Hyperkalemia
Renal side effects are a result of prostaglandin inhibition, leading to
excessive vasoconstriction and decreased renal blood flow.
These agents should either be used extremely cautiously or, preferably,
completely avoided in this patient population.
Narcotic Analgesics
These agents should be used cautiously in patients with renal
insufficiency because of the risk associated with accumulation of toxic
metabolites common to many of these agents.
Metabolites of meperidine, dextropropoxyphene, morphine, tramadol,
and codeine can accumulate causing central nervous system and
respiratory side effects.
One of the safest opioid analgesics to use in the setting of renal failure in
hospitalized patients is hydromorphone, which is primarily metabolized
via glucuronidation in the liver.

DOSE ADJUSTMENTS DURING RENAL
REPLACEMENT THERAPY
604

There are different modalities used for renal replacement therapy (RRT)
in the setting of AKI or ESRD. These modalities are described elsewhere in
this book.
These procedures remove nitrogenous and other waste products that
accumulate in renal failure; however, they also remove drugs and active
metabolites.
The efficiency with which each procedure removes drugs from the body
depends on many factors:
Drug characteristics (molecular weight, plasma protein binding, volume
of distribution)
The dialyzer (membrane type, surface area, thickness)
Geometry of the dialysis system (countercurrent or concurrent blood and
dialysate flow)
Dialysis conditions (blood and dialysate flow rates, duration of dialysis
treatment).
Types of RRT—IHD, CRRT, sustained low-efficiency dialysis
Careful consideration needs to be taken to replace drug lost, based on an
estimation of the amount removed.

Care of the Renal Transplant
Patient
Christina L. Klein

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Approximately a half-million patients in the United States have endstage renal disease (ESRD), and prevalence continues to increase
annually.1,2
Renal transplantation is the preferred treatment for ESRD in
appropriate candidates, as survival, quality of life, and cost savings are
enjoyed compared with chronic dialysis.
Owing to limited organ donor availability, <20% of candidates on the
transplant waitlist will receive a transplant annually; 16,000 transplants
were done in the United States in 2009.2
Many ESRD patients projected to benefit from transplantation are not
referred to or complete a transplant evaluation.
Approximately 65% of the renal transplants done annually in the
United States are from deceased donors (DDs) and the remainder are
from living donors (LDs), either related or unrelated.2
Allograft survival time for a DD kidney transplant averages >8 years,
whereas that of an LD kidney averages >12 years. Improved patient
survival is also observed in recipients of LD compared to DD kidneys.
Death with a functioning allograft is the leading cause of graft loss; the
majority of deaths are due to cardio- and cerebrovascular disease,
malignancy, and infection.
607

There are ∼150,000 kidney transplant recipients actively cared for in
the United States health care system. Transplantation is a treatment, not
a cure, for ESRD and requires continued follow-up and surveillance
throughout the life of the patient or graft. Improved understanding of
posttransplant complications can maximize graft and patient survival.2

TRANSPLANT EVALUATION
Objective
Education regarding the potential risks and benefits of transplant as an
option for ESRD treatment is provided.2–7
Potential kidney transplant recipients are carefully evaluated in order to
detect and treat coexisting illnesses that impact transplant candidacy,
perioperative risk, and survival after transplantation.
In general, candidates should have a projected life expectancy exceeding
5 years.
Patients should be referred if GFR <30 mL/min, with evidence of
progressive irreversible renal disease. Points for time on waitlist accrue
once GFR ≤20 mL/min. Depending on blood type, age, region, race, and
degree of sensitization (panel reactive antibody), average wait time for
a DD organ can exceed 5 to 10 years.2
Preemptive transplant (before dialysis) is encouraged, as patient and
graft survival are inversely correlated with duration of time on dialysis.
Studies
In addition to a complete blood count, chemistry panel, and coagulation
studies, blood type, serologic testing for HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV),
varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV), Hepatitis B and C, and rapid plasma reagin is done.3,4
Electrocardiogram and chest x ray are done for each candidate;
depending on cardiopulmonary history, further testing may include
608

cardiac stress test, echocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, pulmonary
function tests, chest computed tomography (CT).
Cancer screening is done as per general population guidelines for
Papanicolaou smear, mammogram, prostate exam, prostate-specific
antigen, and colonscopy.
Urinalysis, urine culture and imaging of the kidneys (ultrasound/CT)
are routinely performed; candidates with a urologic history may need
further studies (e.g., voiding cystourethrogram) as appropriate.
Immunologic testing is done to assess “sensitization” or presence of
preformed anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies resulting from
prior transplant, pregnancy, and blood transfusions.
HLA: Major histocompatibility complex in humans, which are essential
components of immune function. HLA antigens not shared by the donor
and recipient can stimulate rejection. The six HLA antigens considered in
kidney transplantation “matching” are the two alleles at the A, B, and DR
loci.
Panel reactive antibody: Quantification of preexisting anti-HLA
antibodies. Expressed as a percentage, reflecting the degree of
sensitization to a potential donor pool.
Donor-specific antibodies: Preexisting antibodies in the recipient
against specific donor HLA antigens; may preclude transplantation
depending on crossmatch results.
Cross match: Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) testing uses
recipient cells and donor serum to detect presence of antidonor cytotoxic
antibody. A positive CDC crossmatch is a contraindication to
transplantation. Flow crossmatch is more sensitive than the CDC
crossmatch, but can detect non-HLA or noncytotoxic antibody. Transplant
with a positive flow crossmatch but negative CDC crossmatch should be
done with caution and appropriate posttransplant monitoring.
Absolute/Relative Contraindications
609

Absolute: Kidney transplantation should not be pursued in cases where
limited life expectancy minimizes potential benefit of transplant or
insurmountable psychosocial barriers to posttransplant compliance
exist.3–5 Reversible renal disease, current infection, active
immunologic disease that led to renal failure, active or metastatic
malignancy, high operative risk, active substance abuse,
noncompliance, and poorly controlled psychosis are accepted
absolute ​contraindications.
Relative: Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, obesity,
active hepatitis or chronic liver disease, peripheral vascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease, malnutrition, and history of malignancy
(excluding basal cell skin cancer) necessitate careful pretransplant
assessment to determine candidacy.
Kidney transplant is done at select centers for patients with HIV
infection having an undetectable viral load and CD4 count >200 cells
per μL on antiviral therapy. History of opportunistic infection and
malignancy must be reviewed.
Patients with ESRD and other end-stage organ failure may be candidates
for combined organ transplantation (e.g., kidney–liver, if cirrhosis or
primary oxalosis; kidney–pancreas, if Type 1 diabetes; kidney–heart, if
severe irreversible cardiomyopathy).
Attention is given to cause of ESRD and likelihood of recurrence,
although no disease has a recurrence and graft failure rate that precludes
initial kidney transplantation other than primary oxalosis. Retransplant
must be carefully considered in cases of graft loss due to recurrent
disease.
Waitlist Management
Periodic review of waitlisted patients should include review of medical
history, interim illnesses and hospitalizations, and current functional
status. In addition, testing should be updated per center protocol.3–5
Review may be indicated every 1 to 2 years, depending on patient
comorbidities.
610

Blood transfusions should be avoided because of risk of HLA
sensitization; if required, leukocyte-depleted blood should be
administered.
Immunizations for pneumococcus, influenza, Hepatitis B, and varicella
(if antibody negative) should be administered prior to transplant.
Donor Options
LD: Similar graft outcomes are observed in the current era of
immunosuppression between living related and living unrelated
donors.5,7,8 The exception to this is a two haplotype match from a sibling,
which has superior survival.
DD: Majority of cadaveric kidneys in the United States are obtained from
donors after brain death; kidneys from donors after cardiac death are
increasingly used and have higher rates of delayed graft function (DGF),
but acceptable long-term graft survival.
Expanded criteria donors are aged >60 years or between 50 and 59
with two of the following: hypertension, stroke as cause of death,
terminal creatinine >1.5. These kidneys have poorer long-term graft
survival, but may be appropriate for patients with high waitlist mortality
such as the older candidates, select diabetics, those with limited dialysis
access options or intolerant of dialysis.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive candidates may opt to receive a
kidney from a Hepatitis C-positive donor; studies suggest comparable
graft and patient survival rates compared to kidneys from Hepatitis Cnegative donors.7
Options for patients with an HLA or ABO incompatible, but otherwise
medically acceptable donor, include desensitization and ABOincompatible transplant protocols or local/national kidney exchange
programs.8

TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
611

General Principles
Immunosuppression is used for induction at the time of transplant to
promote graft acceptance, to prevent rejection (maintenance), and for
the treatment of acute rejection (AR).5,8
Adverse effects of immunosuppression are both immune-mediated (e.g.,
increased risk of infection and malignancy) and nonimmune effects.
Immunosuppressive protocols tend to be center and organ specific, but
can be individualized based on immunologic or side-effect profile. At
present, the most commonly used maintenance immunosuppressive
combination in the United States is prednisone, tacrolimus, and
mycophenolate.
Antibody Therapies
Antibody therapies have many applications in transplant, including
induction, treatment of acute cellular- and antibody-mediated rejection,
and treatment of select recurrent diseases.
Polyclonal:
Antithymocyte globulin: This is produced by injecting human
thymocytes into animals and collecting sera containing cytotoxic
antibodies against a variety of T-cell markers. The available preparations
are horse antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM) and rabbit antithymocyte
globulin (Thymoglobulin). They cause T-lymphocyte depletion, and are
used for induction as well as for treatment of rejection. Common side
effects include fever, chills, arthralgias, and myelosuppression; serum
sickness and anaphylaxis (rare) can also occur.
Monoclonal:
Basiliximab (Simulect®): This is a humanized monoclonal antibody
inhibiting the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (CD25), thereby
inhibiting IL-2 activation of T cells. It is used for induction only. There
are few side effects, although rare cases of anaphylaxis are reported.
612

Another IL-2R antagonist, Daclizumab (Zenapax), is no longer available.
Alemtuzumab (Campath 1H): This is a humanized monoclonal antibody
against CD52 approved for use in CLL. It causes rapid and profound Band T-cell depletion and is used off-label in transplantation, in
desensitization protocols, for induction and treatment of rejection.
Rituximab (Rituxan ®): This is a monoclonal antibody directed against
CD20 on B lymphocytes, causing rapid and sustained B-cell depletion. It
is used off-label in transplantation for densensitization and ABOincompatible kidney transplant protocols,8 for treatment of acute
humoral rejection, for certain recurrent diseases (e.g., focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis [FSGS]), and for CD20+ posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorders.
Maintenance Immunosuppression
Available immunosuppressive agents for maintenance
immunosuppression include glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs),
antimetabolites, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors
(mTORi).
Owing to the different mechanisms of action, along with the renal and
nonrenal toxicities of each drug, combination therapy is used to achieve
desired immunosuppressive effect while minimizing other side effects.
Glucocorticoid (prednisone, prednisolone): This is an antiinflammatory agent, which inhibits cytokine and chemokine production
and induces lymphopenia. Adverse side effects are well known and
include development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus, bone disease,
poor wound healing, infections, cataracts, bruising, dyslipidemia,
psychopathologic effects, and steroid myopathy. Maintenance doses are
generally ≤0.1 mg/kg; steroid-free or minimization protocols are
offered at select centers, but higher AR rates and lack of long-term data
limit general acceptance of steroid withdrawal. “Stress dose” increases in
steroids are generally not needed for routine surgery or illness, and may
only increase risk of infection, poor wound healing, or hyperglycemia.
613

CNIs (cyclosporine, tacrolimus): These inhibit calcineurin, thereby
preventing cytokine gene expression and subsequent T-cell activation.
Cyclosporine and tacrolimus have similar side effects, including renal
vasoconstriction, development of chronic interstitial fibrosis,
hypertension, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperuricemia, and risk
of drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. Hirsutism, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, and gingival hyperplasia are associated with cyclosporine,
while tacrolimus is more neurotoxic and diabetogenic.
Cyclosporine formulations include Sandimmune® (dependent on bile for
absorption), microemulsion formula (Neoral®), and generic (Gengraf®).
Formulations are not interchangeable; if changes are made, then
close monitoring of drug levels needed with dose adjustment should be
carried out as necessary. Typical starting dose of 6 to 8 mg/kg/d
divided bid is tapered to achieve long-term maintenance troughs of 75
to 200 ng/mL.
Tacrolimus, also available in generic formulation; as with cyclosporine,
a change of formulation necessitates monitoring of drug levels and
allograft function. Typical starting dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg/kg/d
divided bid is tapered to achieve maintenance trough levels of 3 to 7
ng/mL.
Intravenous administration of CNIs is almost never indicated, as
tacrolimus is readily absorbed and can be given via a nasogastric tube or
sublingually. For patients on cyclosporine, temporary conversion to
tacrolimus is preferable to intravenous administration.
mTORi (sirolimus, everolimus): These prevent cytokine- and growth
factor-mediated T-cell proliferation. Adverse effects include potentiation
of CNI-induced nephrotoxicity, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipidemia,
anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, poor wound healing,
proteinuria, interstitial pneumonia, oral ulcers, acne, pericardial/pleural
effusion (rare). Typical dose of 2 to 5 mg daily is administered to
achieve target trough levels of 5 to 12 ng/dL.
Antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil [Cellcept®,
MMF], mycophenolic acid [Myfortic®, MPA]): Azathioprine is a
614

purine analog, whereas mycophenolate is converted to an active
metabolite (mycophenolic acid), which inhibits the de novo pathway of
purine synthesis. Both inhibit gene replication and lymphocyte
proliferation.
Azathioprine is dosed at 1 to 2 mg/kg/d. Side effects include bone
marrow suppression (especially with concomitant use of allopurinol),
neoplasias, hepatotoxicity (rare).
Typical doses are 500 to 1000 mg bid for MMF, and 360 to 720 mg
bid for MPA. Drug levels are not routinely followed. Generic
formulations are available, but should be used only for financial necessity
as relative clinical effectiveness is unknown. Important side effects
include diarrhea, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux, myelosuppression, and
increased risk of CMV.
Infectious Prophylaxis
Immunizations: Pneumococcal, hepatitis B, and varicella (if antibody
negative) vaccinations should be given prior to transplant. Live vaccines
should be avoided posttransplant. Inactivated influenza vaccination is
recommended yearly.
Prophylaxis is given per center protocol at the time of transplant and
reinstituted following augmentation of immunosuppression (e.g.,
treatment of rejection).
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prevents Pneumocystis jiroveci, urinary
tract infections, listeria, and nocardia.
Valganciclovir or oral ganciclovir prevents CMV infection and is
administered if recipient and/or donor are seropositive pretransplant.
Choice of agent and duration are dictated per center protocol and
dependent on donor/recipient serostatus.
Acyclovir prevents reactivation of HSV, and is also administered lifelong
to EBV seronegative recipients of an EBV seropositive organ, given the
associated risk of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).
615

Fluconazole, clotrimazole troche, or nystatin suspension is used to
prevent oropharyngeal candidiasis.
Pharmacology and Drug–Drug Interactions
Patients are instructed to notify their transplant center with any
medication changes made by other providers to ensure no potential
drug–drug interactions or effect on immunosuppressant drug levels
may occur. The following are commonly encountered interactions, but is
not meant to be all-inclusive. A transplant pharmacist is an invaluable
resource for medication dosing and safety issues.
Both CNI and mTORi are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 IIIA
microsomal enzyme systems, and therefore several potential drug–drug
interactions exist that place patients at risk for either drug toxicities or
rejection.
Drugs than INCREASE levels: diltiazem, verapamil, nicardipine, azole
antifungals, erythromycin, clarithromycin
Drugs that DECREASE levels: rifampin, rifabutin, antiepileptics
(phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine)
Tacrolimus and cyclosporine should not be used together.
CNIs have synergistic nephrotoxicity with amphotericin,
aminoglycosides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB;
potentiate hemodynamic effects), and mTORi (increased nephrotoxicity).
Additionally, use of CNIs with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibric acids,
nicotinic acid increases risk of myopathy.
Azathioprine: If initiating febuxostat or allopurinol, the dose of
azathioprine must be reduced by 25–50% or allopurinol should be
completely avoided. There is a high risk for bone marrow suppression as
these drugs prevent the metabolism of azathioprine by inhibiting
xanthine oxidase.
616

CAUSES OF ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION
Differential diagnosis for posttransplant allograft dysfunction depends
on many factors; importantly, the timing after transplantation (Table
28-1).5,9–11
DGF is commonly defined need for dialysis during the first posttransplant
week. This is usually secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) related to
donor hypovolemia, hypotension, or prolonged ischemia time, but can be
due to surgical or medical complications. It affects 10% to 30% of DD
transplants and is uncommon after LD transplant.
For allograft dysfunction in the early perioperative period, urologic and
vascular surgical complications should be investigated and the possibility
of rejection considered; other common etiologies include hypovolemia,
hyperglycemia, drug toxicity (commonly CNI toxicity), and infection.
AR, recurrent disease, chronic allograft nephropathy, CNI toxicity, BK
virus nephropathy, and transplant renal artery stenosis are transplantspecific causes of renal dysfunction. However, it is important to recognize
that renal failure can also ensue from all causes affecting nontransplant
patients.

617

Surgical Complications
Urologic causes of graft dysfunction include urine leak and
obstruction.
Urine leak can result from ureteral necrosis due to inadequate blood
supply or mechanical disruption of the ureteral implantation into the
bladder. Diagnosis can be confirmed by nuclear scan or, if Jackson Pratt
(JP) drain is present, a JP fluid creatinine, which is significantly greater
than serum creatinine, clinches the diagnosis. Management options are
continued foley catheterization, diverting nephrostomy, or surgical
revision.
Obstruction can result from perinephric fluid collections causing
ureteral compression, ureteral stenosis (ischemic), or ureteral obstruction
by nephrolithiasis or a blood clot. Bladder obstruction can also occur due
to catheter obstruction or, commonly in males, due to prostatic
hypertrophy.
618

Perinephric fluid collections are commonly lymphoceles, although
seromas and urinomas also occur. If causing obstruction, percutaneous
drainage or surgical correction can be performed.
Ureteral stenosis and obstruction are managed with stenting,
nephrostomy, or surgical repair.
Bladder obstruction is managed by foley catheter placement and urologic
consultation, with surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia if
necessary.
Vascular: Renal artery or vein thrombosis is an uncommon and often
irreversible cause of graft dysfunction. Occurrence is associated with
hyperacute or accelerated rejection, hypercoagulable disorders, and
technical issues. Anticoagulation and surgical thrombectomy can
occasionally be successful, although graft loss remains high.
Renal Complications
AR: This affects 10% to 15% of transplants within the first year using
present immunosuppressive protocols. AR is more common if induction
immunosuppression is not administered.5,9–11
Accelerated rejection rarely occurs due to the use of the pretransplant
crossmatch, and is caused by preformed antibodies against donor
antigens. Hyperacute rejection leads to rapid postperfusion graft
thrombosis and loss, whereas delayed hyperacute rejection occurs
within the first few days after transplant. The risk for acute cellular
rejection is greatest in the first weeks-to-months after transplant. Signs
and symptoms include elevated serum creatinine, decreased urine output,
edema, worsening hypertension. Fever, anuria, pain over allograft, or
swollen allograft are often not observed.
Banff criteria are applied to biopsy findings to grade presence and
severity of rejection and rule out other etiologies. Presence of interstitial
infiltrates, tubulitis, and/or arteritis is consistent with acute cellular
rejection. Important differential diagnoses include infectious and druginduced interstitial nephritis causing similar interstitial findings.
619

Pathologic features consistent with acute humoral rejection can range
from ATN, peritubular capillaritis, glomerulitis to necrotizing arteritis
and mural fibrinoid necrosis in severe cases. Positive C4d stain on
immunofluorescence and/or concurrent circulating antidonor antibodies
are needed to diagnose humoral rejection. Mixed cellular and antibodymediated rejection can occur. Treatment strategies are guided by Banff
classification, timing (early vs. late), clinical factors, and underlying
renal function.
Chronic allograft failure (CAF) is second to death with a
functioning graft (DWFG) as the most common cause of graft loss.
Characteristic histologic features include interstitial fibrosis and tubular
atrophy.10
Both immunologic and nonimmunologic factors can contribute to
CAF, causing slow, progressive decline in allograft function, commonly
with proteinuria. Previously used terms including chronic allograft
nephropathy and chronic rejection have fallen out of favor because of lack
of a specific nephropathy and the contributions of nonimmunologic
causes to CAF.
Immunologic risks include rejection, poor HLA matching, and CNI use.
Nonimmunologic risks include donor source (cadaveric), prolonged
ischemia time periods, donor age, size mismatching, and recipient factors
including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use.
Recurrent disease: In patients with glomerulonephritis, recurrent
disease is the third most common cause of graft loss. Recurrent disease
may present with elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, and/or
hematuria, with the diagnosis generally confirmed on allograft biopsy.
Both risk for recurrence and risk of graft loss due to recurrence should be
considered. For example, primary FSGS recurs in 20% to 40% of first
transplants, but close to 100% in retransplants, if the first allograft was
lost because of recurrence. Early recurrence of FSGS is associated with a
poorer prognosis than late, insidious recurrence.11

TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT OUTCOMES
620

The primary cause of graft loss is patient death with a functioning
graft.5,12–14
Immunosuppressive effects contribute to posttransplant mortality,
including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors, malignancy,
and infection.
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in
patients with a functional allograft. Coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy are more frequent in ESRD
and transplant patients because of traditional risk factors (age, sex,
diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use) and nontraditional
risk factors (dialysis duration, proteinuria, inflammation, vascular
calcification, altered coagulation profiles).

HYPERTENSION
This affects 60% to 80% of transplant recipients. Etiology is often
multifactorial, including medications (CNI, steroids, others), rejection, or
other causes of acute/chronic graft dysfunction, transplant renal artery
stenosis, obstructive sleep apnea.12
Treatment goal is to achieve blood pressure <130/80 mm Hg.
Transplant-specific considerations influence antihypertensive choices.
ACEI/ARBs are associated with anemia, hyperkalemia, and are generally
avoided in the immediate perioperative period because of hemodynamic
effects, although they may be renoprotective in the long term. Verapamil
and diltiazem lead to increased CNI levels, and alternative
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine) are
preferred. Hypovolemia can ensue with diuretic use.

ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS
Hyperlipidemia occurs in over half of transplant recipients. Causes
include medication-induced (mTORi > corticosteroids > CNI; also
thiazides) renal dysfunction, proteinuria, obesity, age, diabetes, and
genetic factors.12–14 It is essential to control hyperlipidemia with
621

appropriate medications
A randomized study demonstrated a 29% reduction in major adverse
cardiac events comparing fluvastatin versus placebo in renal transplant
patients. Treatment was according to the National Cholesterol Education
Program guidelines.
There are some pharmacologic concerns regarding the use of statins and
fibrates. There is increased risk for myopathy with CNI + HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors, fibric acids, nicotinic acid.
Close monitoring for side effects and laboratory abnormalities should
be done.
Bile acid sequestrants may decrease immunosuppressive medication
absorption.
Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is also termed new-onset
diabetes after transplant:
A total of 30% to 40% of patients have pretransplant diabetes, with an
additional 25% of patients without pretransplant diabetes developing
PTDM by 3 years.
Hyperglycemia may worsen posttransplant because of corticosteroids, as
well as decreased half-life of endogenous and exogenous insulin because
of improved kidney function.
Risk factors for PTDM include age, obesity and weight gain
posttranpslant, race/ethnicity (more common in African Americans and
Hispanics), CNI use, Hepatitis C infection, and male gender.
Diagnostic criteria for PTDM are controversial, but the current American
Diabetes Association guidelines may be utilized.
Obesity: Average BMI is increasing in transplant candidates as well as in
the general population, prompting BMI cutoffs of 35 to 40 kg/m2 at most
centers.
622

Although obese patients have overall improved mortality after
transplant compared with maintenance dialysis, obesity causes increased
risk of DGF, treatment for AR, graft loss, prolonged wound healing, and
infectious ​complications.
Treatment includes dietary modification, exercise and lifestyle
counseling, consideration for bariatric surgery.
Studies suggest little impact of steroid withdrawal versus continuation on
posttransplant weight gain, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle
modifications.
Bone disease: Unlike the general population, causes of bone disease in
ESRD patients are multifactorial.
They include osteitis fibrosa related to secondary hyperparathyroidism,
as well as adynamic (low-turnover) bone disease, β2-microglobulinassociated arthropathies, and less commonly aluminum-related
osteomalacia.
This is compounded by the use of corticosteroids pre- and posttransplant,
causing bone loss and osteoporosis.
Bisphosphonates may worsen adynamic bone disease. Therefore, routine
use of bone densitometry screening as well as the use of bisphosphonates
is controversial in transplant recipients.
Monitoring of hyperparathyroidism posttransplant and correction of
vitamin D deficiency is presently advised, with consideration for
parathyroidectomy in patients with persistent hypercalcemia and
secondary hyperparathyroidism posttransplant.

HEMATOLOGIC COMPLICATIONS
Anemia is relatively common and multifactorial.5,14
It can be caused by perioperative or other sources of blood loss, iron,
vitamin B12, or folate deficiency.
623

Decreased renal erythropoietin production is seen in the presence of
renal allograft dysfunction and medications such as ACEI, ARB, and
mTORi.
Hemolytic anemia can result from recurrent, de novo or drug-induced
thrombotic microangiopathy.
Parvovirus infection should be considered in cases of refractory anemia
and may respond to intravenous immunoglobulin infusion therapy.
Posttransplant erythrocytosis, defined by a hematocrit exceeding 50%
to 52%, occurs in 10% to 20% of renal transplant recipients.
Secondary causes should be excluded, including transplant renal artery
stenosis, smoking, renal cell, hepatocellular or breast cancers, native
polycystic kidney disease, or inappropriate erythropoietin use.
Treat if hematocrit >55% to avoid thrombotic complications.
ACEI therapy is effective if tolerated.
Refractory cases or those intolerant of ACEI/ARB may require
phlebotomy and hematology referral.

MALIGNANCY
Posttransplant malignancy can be recurrent, de novo, or donor
transmitted (rare).5,15
Immunosuppression inhibits normal immune surveillance, causes direct
DNA damage, and promotes viral-mediated oncogenesis. Many transplant
recipients have a history of pretransplant immunosuppression exposure
(e.g., cytoxan for systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis), and
cumulative exposure should be considered in assessing malignancy risk.
Important viral/malignancy associations include Hepatitis B and C
(hepatocellular carcinoma), EBV (PTLD), human herpes virus 8
(Kaposi sarcoma), and human papilloma virus (squamous cell skin
cancer, vulvar, vaginal, and cervical cancer).
624

Overall risk is three to four fold that of age-matched general
population. Greatest risks are for nonmelanoma skin and lip cancer,
PTLD, Kaposi sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, as well as bladder, cervical,
vulvar, perineal, anogenital, and liver cancers.
Patients with toxic or obstructive nephropathies have the highest risk of
renal and bladder cancers.
PTLD accounts for one-fifth of malignancies posttransplantation, with an
incidence of 1% to 2%. Development is associated with the use of
antilymphocyte therapy for induction or rejection. Majority are nonHodgkin lymphomas of B-cell origin, resulting from EBV-induced B-cell
proliferation. Treatment options include immunosuppression reduction
and possibly chemotherapy. Rituximab is utilized for CD20+ PTLD.
General population guidelines are followed for breast, cervical, prostate,
and colon cancer screening. Annual skin exam and use of sunscreen are
advised for all recipients. Other screening is patient specific; for example,
alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and liver ultrasound in HCV-positive recipients
for hepatocellular carcinoma screening.
Life-threatening malignancies may warrant significant or total
withdrawal of immunosuppression.

INFECTIONS
Immediately posttransplant, patients should be monitored for common
postoperative infections such as wound, line, urinary infections, and
pneumonia.5,16
Intensive immunosuppression used at time of transplant increases the
risk of opportunistic infections in the first 6 months, including CMV
and other viral pathogens, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus,
other fungal infections, mycobacterial disease, Listeria monocytogenes,
Nocardia.
After 6 months, the risk of opportunistic infections persists but to a lesser
degree, with infections more commonly due to community-acquired
625

pathogens, particularly in those with successful graft function
posttransplant.
Factors to consider in the differential diagnosis of infection include time
from transplant, cumulative immunosuppression history, other
immunodeficiency states, donor and recipient exposure/infection history,
recent hospitalizations, foreign bodies (stents, catheters, valves), open
wounds, fluid collections, comorbidities (HIV, diabetes, liver disease),
nutritional status, occupational and environmental exposures.
For mild or moderate infections, maintenance of immunosuppression
with appropriate antimicrobial administration is advised. More severe or
certain viral infections (CMV, polyoma virus) warrant
immunosuppression reduction commonly achieved by discontinuation
of the antimetabolite and possible reduction in CNI doses.
Specific Viral Pathogens
CMV: This is the most common viral pathogen postkidney transplant,
affecting 10% to 30% of recipients (75% if no prophylaxis).5,16,17
Prophylaxis type and duration (3 to 12 months) are dependent on
pretransplant donor and recipient serologies. CMV-seronegative patients
receiving a CMV-seropositive organ are at greatest risk.
Symptoms: Fever, malaise, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia. It can
involve the intestine (40%), liver (20%), lung (10%), kidney, eye, central
nervous system (rare).
Diagnosis: Seroconversion with a positive IgM titer, blood polymerase
chain reaction demonstrating viral replication, or by histopathology of
infected tissue. A high index of suspicion is required, given the vague
presentation.
Treatment: Oral valganciclovir (450 to 900 mg PO bid) or intravenous
ganciclovir (2.5 to 5.0 mg/kg bid [adjusted as per renal function]) for 3
to
4 weeks; foscarnet and cidofovir reserved for ganciclovir-resistant cases
only due to significant drug toxicities.
626

BK (polyoma virus): BK virus is present as a latent infection in 60% to
80% of transplant recipients, with reactivation driven by
immunosuppression. Manifestations include interstitial nephritis and
ureteral stenosis; graft loss can occur due to BK virus nephropathy.
BK virus nephropathy can be confirmed by the presence of viral
inclusions on allograft biopsy; intersitital nephritis can otherwise
mimic acute cellular rejection.
As viremia precedes nephropathy, preemptive reduction or withdrawl
of antimetabolite, if viremia is present, can prevent nephropathy
development.
EBV: This is associated with PTLD. In EBV-seronegative recipients from
an EBV-seropositive donor, lifelong acyclovir prophylaxis is
recommended. However, a benefit of antiviral therapy in treatment of
PTLD has not been established. Rather, PTLD is treated with reduction or
withdrawl of immunosuppression and often with chemotherapy with
Rituximab.
Hepatitis B and C: The incidence of Hepatitis B is declining in the ESRD
population because of immunization. Approximately 5% of transplant
recipients have Hepatitis C.
Candidates who are Hepatitis BsAg- or Hepatitis C-positive require
hepatology evaluation prior to transplant to determine renal transplant
candidacy. Renal transplant is contraindicated if cirrhosis is present,
unless combined liver–kidney transplant is pursued.
Antiviral therapy should be used in Hepatitis BsAg-positive transplant
candidates pre- and posttransplant, particularly if evidence of viral
replication (HBeAg, HBV DNA) is present.
Antiviral therapy for Hepatitis C should be considered
pretransplantation, as the posttransplant administration of interferon is
associated with an increased risk of AR.
Studies demonstrate inferior patient and graft outcomes in HCV627

positive compared to HCV-negative recipients. However, for the HCVpositive patient, transplant is associated with improved survival
compared with maintenance dialysis and is the treatment of choice.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pregnancy
Female transplant recipients of childbearing age must be counseled
regarding increased fertility and likelihood of pregnancy following
successful transplant, to include contraception if desired, and medication
counseling.18
Improved outcomes are seen if pregnancy occurs >12 to 24 months
after a successful transplant in a recipient with serum creatinine <1.5
to 2.0 mg/dL, minimal proteinuria, no history of rejection, requiring
minimal/no hypertensive therapy, with minimal comorbid conditions,
and with appropriate preconception medication counseling.
Immunosuppressive practice in transplantation has arisen from clinical
experience. All immunosuppressive drugs are Food and Drug
Administration pregnancy safety class C (risk cannot be ruled out) or
D (positive evidence of risk), driven by both human data and animal
studies. However, MMF has been clearly demonstrated to be
teratogenic, causing facial and ear structural malformations, and should
be substituted with Azathioprine. mTORi are avoided due to
embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity in animal models. Prednisone, CNIs, and
azathiprine are used during pregnancy.
CNI levels may fall during pregnancy because of increases in maternal
blood volume, and close monitoring of drug levels is needed to avoid
precipitation of rejection.
Common complications include preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and
small for gestational age infants. Additionally, urinary tract infections
are common and should be treated promptly in the transplant recipient
with culture documentation of clearance.

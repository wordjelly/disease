PREFACE

I have been deeply amazed and grateful to see how the Case Files books have
been so well received, and have helped students to learn more effectively. In the
7 short years since Case Files: Obstetrics and Gynecology has first made it in print,
the series has now multiplied to span the most of the clinical and the basic science disciplines, and been translated into over a dozen foreign languages.
Numerous students have sent encouraging remarks, suggestions, and recommendations, many of which have been incorporated in this third edition. Questions
have been improved to better reflect the USMLE format, and explanations have
been expanded to help the student understand the mechanisms and the reason
that the other choices are incorrect. Five completely new cases have been
written. Updated or new sections include health maintenance, cervical cytology
with human papilloma virus subtyping, contraception, polycystic ovarian syndrome, osteoporosis, neonatal complications, and human immunodeficiency
virus. This third edition has been a collaborative work with my wonderful coauthors and contributors, and with the suggestions from three generations of students. Truly, the enthusiastic encouragement from students throughout not just
the United States but worldwide provides me the inspiration and energy to continue to write. It is thus with humility that I offer my sincere thanks to students
everywhere ... for without students, how can a teacher teach?

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The curriculum that evolved into the ideas for this series was inspired by two
talented and forthright students, Philbert Yao and Chuck Rosipal, who have
since graduated from medical school. It has been a tremendous joy to work
with my friend, colleague, and program director, Dr. Bentor Baker III. It is
also a privilege to work with Dr. Ross, who has been a steady hand in administrating the medical student clerkship for so many years. Unfortunately Dr.
Larry Gilstrap could no longer collaborate on this book due to his many other
duties; I owe him so much in being the motivation and “fire” behind this
series. It is with fondness that I recall the many hours in his office as he
scratched red through my manuscript to bring it up to his exacting standards,
and it is those standards that I still strive for with each book. It is a personal
honor and with extreme gratitude that I am able to work with Dr. John
Jennings, a visionary, brilliant obstetrician gynecologist, leader, and friend.
Also, I am awed by the many excellent contributors who continue to work
under the deadlines and pleas of perfectionists. I am greatly indebted to my
editor, Catherine Johnson, whose exuberance, experience, and vision helped
to shape this series. I appreciate McGraw-Hill’s believing in the concept of
teaching through clinical cases. I am also grateful to Catherine Saggese for her
excellent production expertise, and Cindy Yoo for her wonderful editing.
I cherish the ever-organized and precise Gita Raman, senior project manager,
whose friendship and talent I greatly value; she keeps me focused, and nurtures
each of my books from manuscript to print. At Methodist Hospital, I appreciate
the great support from Drs. Marc Boom, Dirk Sostman, Alan Kaplan, and Karin
Larsen-Pollock. Likewise, without Ayse McCracken, Reggie Abraham, and
Marla Buffington for their advice and support, this book may never have been
completed. Without my dear colleagues, Drs. Konrad Harms, Jeané Holmes, Priti
Schachel, and Christopher Hobday, this book could not have been written.
I appreciate Yaki Bryant, who has faithfully and energetically served as the
extraordinary student coordinator for literally thousands and thousands of students at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. Most of all, I appreciate my loving wife, Terri, and my four wonderful children, Andy, Michael,
Allison, and Christina, for their patience and understanding.

INTRODUCTION

Mastering the cognitive knowledge within a field such as obstetrics and gynecology is a formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, to procure and filter through the clinical and laboratory data, to develop
a differential diagnosis, and finally to make a rational treatment plan. To gain
these skills, the student often learns best at the bedside, guided and instructed
by experienced teachers, and inspired toward self-directed, diligent reading.
Clearly, there is no replacement for education at the bedside. Unfortunately,
clinical situations usually do not encompass the breadth of the specialty.
Perhaps the best alternative is a carefully crafted patient case designed to
stimulate the clinical approach and decision making. In an attempt to achieve
that goal, we have constructed a collection of clinical vignettes to teach diagnostic or therapeutic approaches relevant to obstetrics and gynecology. Most
importantly, the explanations for the cases emphasize the mechanisms and
underlying principles, rather than merely rote questions and answers.
This book is organized for versatility: It allows the student “in a rush” to go
quickly through the scenarios and check the corresponding answers, and it
provides more detailed information for the student who wants thought-provoking explanations. The answers are arranged from simple to complex: a
summary of the pertinent points, the bare answers, an analysis of the case, an
approach to the topic, a comprehension test at the end for reinforcement and
emphasis, and a list of resources for further reading. The clinical vignettes are
purposely placed in random order to simulate the way that real patients present to the practitioner. A listing of cases is included in Section III to aid the
students who desire to test their knowledge of a specific area, or who want to
review a topic including basic definitions. Finally, we intentionally did not use
a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format in our clinical case scenarios, since
clues (or distractions) are not available in the real world. Nevertheless, several MCQs are included at the end of each case discussion (comprehension
questions) to reinforce concepts or introduce related topics.

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS BOOK
Each case is designed to simulate a patient encounter with open-ended questions. At times, the patient’s complaint is different from the most concerning
issue, and sometimes extraneous information is given. The answers are organized into four different parts:
xix

xx

INTRODUCTION

PART I
1. Summary: The salient aspects of the case are identified, filtering out the
extraneous information. Students should formulate their summary from
the case before looking at the answers. A comparison to the summation in
the answer will help to improve their ability to focus on the important
data, while appropriately discarding the irrelevant information—a fundamental skill in clinical problem solving.
2. A Straightforward Answer is given to each open-ended question.
3. The Analysis of the Case is comprised of two parts:
a) Objectives of the Case: A listing of the two or three main principles
that are crucial for a practitioner to manage the patient. Again, the students are challenged to make educated “guesses” about the objectives of
the case upon initial review of the case scenario, which helps to sharpen
their clinical and analytical skills.
b) Considerations: A discussion of the relevant points and brief approach
to the specific patient.

PART II
Approach to the Disease Process: It consists of two distinct parts:
a) Definitions: Terminology pertinent to the disease process.
b) Clinical Approach: A discussion of the approach to the clinical problem in general, including tables, figures, and algorithms.

PART III
Comprehension Questions: Each case contains several multiple-choice questions, which reinforce the material, or which introduce new and related concepts. Questions about material not found in the text will have explanations
in the answers.

PART IV
Clinical Pearls: Several clinically important points are reiterated as a summation of the text. This allows for easy review, such as before an examination.

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Part 1. Approach to the Patient
The transition from textbook and/or journal article learning to the application
of the information in a specific clinical situation is one of the most challenging
tasks in medicine. It requires retention of information, organization of the facts,
and recall of a myriad of data in precise application to the patient. The purpose
of this book is to facilitate this process. The first step is gathering information,
also known as establishing the database. This includes taking the history; performing the physical examination; and obtaining selective laboratory examinations or
special evaluations, such as urodynamic testing and/or imaging tests. Of these,
the historical examination is the most important and useful. Sensitivity and
respect should always be exercised during the interview of patients.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The history is usually the single most important tool in obtaining a diagnosis.The art of seeking the information in a nonjudgmental, sensitive, and
thorough manner cannot be overemphasized.

HISTORY
1. Basic information:
a. Age: Age must be recorded because some conditions are more common at certain ages; for instance, pregnant women younger than 17
years or older than 35 years are at greater risk for preterm labor,
preeclampsia, or miscarriage.
b. Gravidity: Number of pregnancies including current pregnancy
(includes miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and stillbirths).
c. Parity: Number of pregnancies that have ended at gestational age(s)
greater than 20 weeks.
d. Abortuses: Number of pregnancies that have ended at gestational age(s)
less than 20 weeks (includes ectopic pregnancies, induced abortions,
and spontaneous abortions).

Clinical Pearl
➤ Some practitioners use a four-digit parity system to designate the number
of term deliveries, number of preterm deliveries, number of abortuses, and
number of live births (TPAL system). For example, G2 P1001 indicates
gravidity 2 (two pregnancies including the current one), parity 1001;
1 prior term delivery, no preterm deliveries, no abortuses, and 1 living.

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

2. Last menstrual period (LMP): The first day of the last menstrual period.
In obstetric patients, the certainty of the LMP is important in determining the gestational age. The estimated gestational age (EGA) is calculated from the LMP or by ultrasound. A simple rule for calculating the
expected due date (EDD) is to subtract 3 months from the LMP and add
7 days to the first day of the LMP (eg, an LMP of 1 November would
equal an EDD of 8 August). Because of delay in ovulation in some cycles,
this is not always accurate.
3. Chief complaint: What is it that brought the patient into the hospital or
office? Is it a scheduled appointment, or an unexpected symptom, such as
abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding in pregnancy? The duration and character of the complaint, associated symptoms, and exacerbating and relieving factors should be recorded. The chief complaint engenders a differential
diagnosis, and the possible etiologies should be explored by further inquiry.
For example, if the chief complaint is postmenopausal bleeding, the concern is endometrial cancer. Thus, some of the questions should be related
to the risk factors for endometrial cancer, such as hypertension, diabetes,
anovulation, early age of menarche, late age of menopause, obesity, infertility, nulliparity, and so forth.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The first line of any obstetric presentation should include age, gravidity,
parity, LMP, estimated gestational age, and chief complaint.
Example: A 32-year-old G3 P1011 woman, whose LMP was April 2 and
who has a pregnancy with an estimated gestational age of 32 4/7 weeks’
gestation, complains of lower abdominal cramping.

4. Past gynecologic history:
a. Menstrual history
i. Age of menarche (should normally be older than 9 years and younger
than 16 years).
ii. Character of menstrual cycles: Interval from the first day of one
menses to the first day of the next menses (normal is 28 ± 7 days,
or between 21 and 35 days).
iii. Quantity of menses: Menstrual flow should last less than 7 days
(or be <80 mL in total volume). If menstrual flow is excessive,
then it is called menorrhagia.
iv. Irregular and heavy menses is called menometrorrhagia.
b. Contraceptive history: Duration, type, and last use of contraception,
and any side effects.
c. Sexually transmitted diseases: A positive or negative history of herpes
simplex virus, syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, human immunodeficiency

virus (HIV), pelvic inflammatory disease, or human papillomavirus.
Number of sexual partners, whether a recent change in partners, and use
of barrier contraception.
Obstetric history: Date and gestational age of each pregnancy at termination, and outcome; if induced abortion, then gestational age and method. If
delivered, then whether the delivery was vaginal or cesarean; if applicable,
vacuum or forceps delivery, or type of cesarean (low-transverse vs classical).
All complications of pregnancies should be listed.
Past medical history: Any illnesses, such as hypertension, hepatitis, diabetes
mellitus, cancer, heart disease, pulmonary disease, and thyroid disease should
be elicited. Duration, severity, and therapies should be included. Any hospitalizations should be listed with reason for admission, intervention, and
location of hospital.
Past surgical history: Year and type of surgery should be elucidated and
any complications documented. Type of incision (laparoscopy vs laparotomy) should be recorded.
Allergies: Reactions to medications should be recorded, including severity
and temporal relationship to medication. Nonmedicine allergies, such as
to latex or iodine, are also important to note. Immediate hypersensitivity
should be distinguished from an adverse reaction.
Medications: A list of medications, dosage, route of administration and
frequency, and duration of use should be obtained. Prescription, over-thecounter, and herbal remedies are all relevant. Use or abuse of illicit drugs,
tobacco, or alcohol should also be recorded.
Review of systems: A systematic review should be performed but focused on
the more common diseases. For example, in pregnant women, the presence
of symptoms referable to preeclampsia, such as headache, visual disturbances, epigastric pain, or facial swelling, should be queried. In an elderly
woman, symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, or palpitations, should be elicited.

Clinical Pearl
➤ In every pregnancy greater than 20 weeks’ gestation, the patient should be
questioned about symptoms of preeclampsia (headaches, visual disturbances, dyspnea, epigastric pain, and face/hand swelling).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. General appearance: Cachectic versus well-nourished, anxious versus
calm, alert versus obtunded.
2. Vital signs: Temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
Height and weight are often placed here.

3. Head and neck examination: Evidence of trauma, tumors, facial edema,
goiter, and carotid bruits should be sought. Cervical and supraclavicular
nodes should be palpated.
4. Breast examination: Inspection for symmetry, skin or nipple retraction
with the patient’s hands on her hips (to accentuate the pectoral muscles),
and with arms raised. With the patient supine, the breasts should then be
palpated systematically to assess for masses. The nipple should be assessed
for discharge, and the axillary and supraclavicular regions should be
examined for adenopathy.
5. Cardiac examination: The point of maximal impulse (PMI) should be
ascertained, and the heart auscultated at the apex of the heart as well as
base. Heart sounds, murmurs, and clicks should be characterized. Systolic
flow murmurs are fairly common in pregnant women due to the increased
cardiac output, but significant diastolic murmurs are unusual.
6. Pulmonary examination: The lung fields should be examined systematically and thoroughly. Wheezes, rales, rhonchi, and bronchial breath sounds
should be recorded.
7. Abdominal examination: The abdomen should be inspected for scars, distension, masses or organomegaly (ie, spleen or liver), and discoloration.
For instance, the Grey Turner sign of discoloration at the flank areas may
indicate intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Auscultation of
bowel sounds should be accomplished to identify normal versus highpitched, and hyperactive versus hypoactive sounds. The abdomen should
be percussed for the presence of shifting dullness (indicating ascites).
Careful palpation should begin initially away from the area of pain,
involving one hand on top of the other, to assess for masses, tenderness,
and peritoneal signs. Tenderness should be recorded on a scale (eg, 1 to 4,
where 4 is the most severe pain). Guarding, whether it is voluntary or
involuntary, should be noted.
8. Back and spine examination: The back should be assessed for symmetry,
tenderness, or masses. In particular, the flank regions are important to
assess for pain on percussion since that may indicate renal disease.
9. Pelvic examination (adequate preparation of the patient is crucial, including counseling about what to expect, adequate lubrication, and sensitivity
to pain and discomfort):
a. The external genitalia should be observed for masses or lesions, discoloration, redness, or tenderness. Ulcers in this area may indicate herpes
simplex virus, vulvar carcinoma, or syphilis; a vulvar mass at the 5:00
or 7:00 o’clock positions can suggest a Bartholin gland cyst or abscess.
Pigmented lesions may require biopsy since malignant melanoma is not
uncommon in the vulvar region.
b. Speculum examination: The vagina should be inspected for lesions,
discharge, estrogen effect (well-ruggated vs atrophic), and presence of
a cystocele or a rectocele. The appearance of the cervix should be
described, and masses, vesicles, or other lesions should be noted.

Figure I–1. Bimanual pelvic examination. The examiner evaluates the patient’s
uterus by palpating her cervix vaginally while simultaneously assessing her uterine
fundus abdominally.

c. Bimanual examination: Initially, the index and middle finger of the
one gloved hand should be inserted into the patient’s vagina underneath the cervix, while the clinician’s other hand is placed on the
abdomen at the uterine fundus. With the uterus trapped between the
two hands, the examiner should identify whether there is cervical
motion tenderness, and evaluate the size, shape, and directional axis
of the uterus. The adnexa should then be assessed with the vaginal
hand in the lateral vaginal fornices. The normal ovary is approximately the size of a walnut (Figure I–1).
d. Rectal examination: A rectal examination will reveal masses in the posterior pelvis, and may identify occult blood in the stool. Nodularity and
tenderness in the uterosacral ligament can be signs of endometriosis.
The posterior uterus and palpable masses in the cul-de-sac can be identified by rectal examination.
10. Extremities and skin: The presence of joint effusions, tenderness, skin
edema, and cyanosis should be recorded.
11. Neurologic examination: Patients who present with neurologic complaints usually require a thorough assessment including evaluation of the
cranial nerves, strength, sensation, and reflexes.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The vaginal examination assesses the anterior pelvis, whereas the rectal
examination is directed at the posterior pelvis.

12. Laboratory assessment for obstetric patients:
a. Prenatal laboratory tests usually include the following:
i. CBC, or complete blood count, to assess for anemia and
thrombocytopenia.
ii. Blood type, Rh, and antibody screen is of paramount importance
for all pregnant women; for those women who are Rh negative,
Rhogam is administered at 28 weeks’ gestation and at delivery
(if the baby proves Rh positive) to prevent isoimmunization.
iii. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Indicates that the patient
is infectious. At birth, the newborn should be given hepatitis B
immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine in an attempt
to prevent neonatal hepatitis.
iv. Rubella titer: If the patient is not immune to rubella, she should be
vaccinated immediately postpartum; because it is a live-attenuated
vaccine, this immunization is not given during pregnancy.
v. Syphilis nontreponemal test (RPR [rapid plasma reagin] or VDRL
[venereal disease research laboratory]): A positive test necessitates
confirmation with a treponemal test, such as MHATP (microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to treponema pallidum) or
FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponema antibody absorbed). Treatment
during pregnancy is crucial to prevent congenital syphilis; penicillin is the agent of choice. Pregnant women who are allergic to
penicillin usually undergo desensitization and receive penicillin.
vi. Human immunodeficiency virus test: The screening test is usually
the ELISA and, when positive, will necessitate the Western blot
or other confirmatory test.
vii. Urine culture or urinalysis: To assess for asymptomatic bacteriuria, which complicates 6% to 8% of pregnancies.
viii. Pap smear: To assess for cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer;
involves both ectocervical component and endocervical sampling (Figure I–2). Many clinicians prefer the liquid-based media
because it may provide better cellular sampling and allows for
HPV subtyping.
ix. Endocervical assays for gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia trachomatis
for high-risk patients.
b. Timed prenatal tests:
i. Serum screening for neural tube defects or Down syndrome offered;
usually performed between 16 to 20 weeks’ gestation. First-trimester
screening for trisomies with serum pregnancy-associated plasma

protein-A (PAPP-A), beta human chorionic free gonadotropin
(βhCG) and nuchal translucency (NT) has gained popularity as well.
ii. Screening for gestational diabetes at 26 to 28 weeks; generally
consists of a 50-g oral glucose load and assessment of the serum
glucose level after 1 hour.
iii. Some practitioners choose to repeat the complete blood count,
cervical cultures, or syphilis serology in the third trimester.
iv. If the culture strategy for group B streptococcus is adopted, then
introital cultures are obtained at 35 to 37 weeks’ gestation.

13. Laboratory tests for gynecologic patients:
a. Dependent on age, presence of coexisting disease, and chief complaint.
b. Common scenarios:
i. Threatened abortion: Quantitative hCG and/or progesterone levels
may help to establish the viability of a pregnancy and risk of
ectopic pregnancy.
ii. Menorrhagia due to uterine fibroids: CBC, endometrial biopsy, and
Pap smear. The endometrial biopsy is performed to assess for endometrial cancer and the Pap smear for cervical dysplasia or cancer.
iii. A woman 55 years or older with an adnexal mass: CA-125 and
CEA tumor markers for epithelial ovarian tumors.
14. Imaging procedures:
a. Ultrasound examination:
i. Obstetric patients: Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging procedure in pregnant women. It can be used to establish the
viability of the pregnancy, number of fetuses, location of the placenta, or establish the gestational age of the pregnancy. Targeted
examinations can help to examine for structural abnormalities of
the fetus.
ii. Gynecologic patients: Adnexal masses evaluated by sonography
are assessed for size and echogenic texture; simple (fluid filled) versus
complex (fluid and solid components) versus solid. The uterus can be
characterized for presence of masses, such as uterine fibroids, and the
endometrial stripe can be measured. In postmenopausal women, a
thickened endometrial stripe may indicate malignancy. Fluid in the
cul-de-sac may indicate ascites. The gynecologic ultrasound examination usually also includes investigation of the kidneys, because
hydronephrosis may suggest a pelvic process (ureteral obstruction).
Saline infusion into the uterine cavity via a transcervical catheter
can enhance the ultrasound examination of intrauterine growths
such as polyps.

Clinical Pearl
➤ Sonohysterography is a special ultrasound examination of the uterus that
involves injecting a small amount of saline into the endometrial cavity to
better define the intrauterine cavity. It can help to identify endometrial
polyps or submucous myomata.

b.

Computed tomography (CT) scan:
i. Because of the radiation concerns, this procedure is usually not
performed on pregnant women unless sonography is not helpful,
and it is deemed necessary.

10

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ii. The CT scan is useful in women with possible abdominal and/or
pelvic masses, and may help to delineate the lymph nodes and
retroperitoneal disorders.
c. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):
i. Identifies soft tissue planes very well and may assist in defining
müllerian defects, such as vaginal agenesis or uterine didelphys
(condition of double uterus and double cervix), and in selected
circumstances may also aid in the evaluation of uterine anomalies.
ii. May be helpful in establishing the location of a pregnancy, such as
in differentiating a normal pregnancy from a cervical pregnancy.
d. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP):
i. Intravenous dye is used to assess the concentrating ability of the kidneys, the patency of the ureters, and the integrity of the bladder.
ii. It is also useful in detecting hydronephrosis, ureteral stone, or
ureteral obstruction.
e. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG):
i. A small amount of radiopaque dye is introduced through a transcervical cannula and radiographs are taken.
ii. It is useful for the detection of intrauterine abnormalities (submucous fibroids or intrauterine adhesions) and patency of the fallopian tubes (tubal obstruction or hydrosalpinx).

Part 2. Approach to Clinical Problem Solving
There are typically four distinct steps that a clinician undertakes to solve most
clinical problems systematically:
1. Making the diagnosis.
2. Assessing the severity and/or stage of the disease.
3. Rendering a treatment based on the stage of the disease.
4. Following the patient’s response to the treatment.

MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis is made by careful evaluation of the database, analysis of the
information, assessment of the risk factors, and development of the list of
possibilities (the differential diagnosis). The process includes knowing which
pieces of information are meaningful and which may be thrown out. Experience
and knowledge help to guide the physician to “key in” on the most important
possibilities. A good clinician also knows how to ask the same question in
several different ways, and use different terminology. For example, patients at
times may deny having been treated for “pelvic inflammatory disease,” but
will answer affirmatively to being hospitalized for “a tubal infection.”
Reaching a diagnosis may be achieved by systematically reading about each

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

11

possible cause and disease. The patient’s presentation is then matched up
against each of these possibilities, and each is either placed high up on the list
as a potential etiology, or moved lower down because of disease prevalence, the
patient’s presentation, or other clues. A patient’s risk factors may influence the
probability of a diagnosis.
Usually, a long list of possible diagnoses can be pared down to two to three
most likely ones, based on selective laboratory or imaging tests. For example,
a woman who complains of lower abdominal pain and has a history of a prior
sexually transmitted disease may have salpingitis; another patient who has
abdominal pain, amenorrhea, and a history of prior tubal surgery may have
an ectopic pregnancy. Furthermore, yet another woman with a one-day history of periumbilical pain localizing to the right lower quadrant may have
acute appendicitis.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The first step in clinical problem-solving is making the diagnosis.

ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
After ascertaining the diagnosis, the next step is to characterize the severity
of the disease process; in other words, describe “how bad” a disease is. With
malignancy, this is done formally by staging the cancer. Most cancers are
categorized from stage I (least severe) to stage IV (most severe). Some diseases,
such as preeclampsia, may be designated as mild or severe. With other ailments,
there is a moderate category. With some infections, such as syphilis, the staging
depends on the duration and extent of the infection, and follows along the
natural history of the infection (ie, primary syphilis, secondary, latent period,
and tertiary/neurosyphilis).

Clinical Pearl
➤ The second step in clinical problem-solving is to establish the severity or
stage of disease. There is usually prognostic or treatment significance
based on the stage.

TREATMENT BASED ON STAGE
Many illnesses are stratified according to severity because prognosis and
treatment often vary based on the severity. If neither the prognosis nor the
treatment was influenced by the stage of the disease process, there would
not be a reason to subcategorize a disease as mild or severe. As an example,

12

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

a pregnant woman at 32 weeks’ gestation with mild preeclampsia is at less
risk from the disease than if she developed severe preeclampsia (particularly if
the severe preeclampsia were pulmonary edema or eclampsia). Accordingly,
with mild preeclampsia, the management may be expectant, letting the pregnancy continue while watching for any danger signs (severe disease). In contrast, if severe preeclampsia complicated this same 32-week pregnancy, the
treatment would be magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures (eclampsia) and,
most importantly, delivery. It is primarily delivery that “cures” the
preeclampsia. In this disease, severe preeclampsia means both maternal and
fetal risks are increased. As another example, urinary tract infections may be
subdivided into lower tract infections (cystitis) that are treated by oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis, versus upper tract infections (pyelonephritis)
that generally require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.
Bacterial vaginosis (BV), which has been associated with preterm delivery,
endometritis, and vaginal cuff cellulitis (following hysterectomy), does not
have a severe or mild substaging. The presence of BV may slightly increase
the risk of problems, but neither the prognosis nor the treatment is affected
by “more” BV or “less” BV. Hence, the student should approach a new disease
by learning the mechanism, clinical presentation, staging, and the treatment
based on stage.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The third step in clinical problem-solving is that, for most conditions, the
treatment is tailored to the extent or “stage” of the disease.

FOLLOWING THE RESPONSE TO TREATMENT
The final step in the approach to disease is to follow the patient’s response to
the therapy. The “measure” of response should be recorded and monitored.
Some responses are clinical, such as improvement (or lack of improvement) in a
patient’s abdominal pain, temperature, or pulmonary examination. Obviously,
the student must work on being more skilled in eliciting the data in an unbiased
and standardized manner. Other responses may be followed by imaging tests,
such as a CT scan to establish retroperitoneal node size in a patient receiving
chemotherapy, or a tumor marker, such as the CA-125 level in a woman
receiving chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. For syphilis, it may be the results
of the nonspecific treponemal antibody test RPR titer over time. The student
must be prepared to know what to do if the measured marker does not respond
according to what is expected. Is the next step to retreat, or to reconsider the
diagnosis, or to repeat the metastatic work-up, or to follow up with another
more specific test?

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

13

Clinical Pearl
➤ The fourth step in clinical problem-solving is to monitor treatment
response or efficacy, which may be measured in different ways. It may be
symptomatic (patient feels better), or based on physical examination
(fever), a laboratory test (CA-125 level), or an imaging test (ultrasound size
of ovarian cyst).

Part 3. Approach to Reading
The clinical problem-oriented approach to reading is different from the classic “systematic” research of a disease. Patients rarely present with a clear diagnosis; hence, the student must become skilled in applying the textbook
information to the clinical setting. Furthermore, a reader retains more information when reading with a purpose. In other words, the student should read
with the goal of answering specific questions. Likewise, the student should
have a plan for the acquisition and use of the information; the process is similar
to having a mental “flow chart” and each step sifting through diagnostic possibilities, therapy, complications, and risk factors. There are several fundamental questions that facilitate clinical thinking. These are:
1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
2. What should be your next step?
3. What is the most likely mechanism for this process?
4. What are the risk factors for this condition?
5. What are the complications associated with the disease process?
6. What is the best therapy?
7. How would you confirm the diagnosis?

Clinical Pearl
➤ Reading with the purpose of answering the seven fundamental clinical
questions improves retention of information and facilitates the application
of “book knowledge” to “clinical knowledge.”

WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSIS?
The method of establishing the diagnosis has been covered in the previous section. One way of attacking this problem is to develop standard “approaches” to
common clinical situations. It is helpful to understand the most common
causes of various presentations, such as “the most common cause of postpartum
hemorrhage is uterine atony.” (Clinical Pearls appear at the end of each case.)

14

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

The clinical scenario would be something such as:
An 18-year-old G1 P0 adolescent female undergoes an uncomplicated vaginal
delivery at term. After the placenta is delivered, she has 1500 cc of vaginal
bleeding. What is the most likely diagnosis?
With no other information to go on, the student would note that this
patient has postpartum hemorrhage (blood loss of >500 mL with a vaginal
delivery). Using the “most common cause” information, the student would
make an educated guess that the patient has uterine atony.
However, what if the scenario also included the following phrase?
The uterus is noted to be firm.
Now the most likely diagnosis is a genital tract laceration, usually involving the cervix. With a firm well contracted uterus, atony is not likely.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony.
Thus, the first step in patient assessment and management is uterine
massage to check if the uterus is boggy.
➤ If the uterus is firm, and the woman is still bleeding, then the clinician
should consider a genital tract laceration.
➤ Now, the student would use the clinical pearl: “The most common
cause of postpartum hemorrhage with a firm uterus is a genital tract
laceration.”

WHAT SHOULD BE YOUR NEXT STEP?
This question is difficult because the next step has many possibilities; the
answer may be to obtain more diagnostic information, stage the illness, or
introduce therapy. It is often a more challenging question than “What is the
most likely diagnosis?” because there may be insufficient information to make
a diagnosis and the next step may be to pursue more diagnostic information.
Another possibility is that there is enough information for a probable diagnosis, and the next step is to stage the disease. Finally, the most appropriate
answer may be to treat. Hence, from clinical data, a judgment needs to be rendered regarding how far along one is on the road of:
Make a diagnosis → Stage the disease →
Treat based on stage → Follow response
Frequently, the student is taught to “regurgitate” the information that
someone has written about a particular disease, but is not skilled at giving the
next step. This talent is learned optimally at the bedside, in a supportive

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

15

environment, with freedom to make educated guesses, and with constructive
feedback. A sample scenario describes a student’s thought process as follows.
1. Make the diagnosis: “Based on the information I have, I believe that this
patient has a pelvic inflammatory disease because she is not pregnant and
has lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and adnexal
tenderness.”
2. Stage the disease: “I don’t believe that this is severe disease, since she does
not have high fever, evidence of sepsis, or peritoneal signs. An ultrasound
has already been done showing no abscess (tubo-ovarian abscess would put
her in a severe category).”
3. Treat based on stage: “Therefore, my next step is to treat her with intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline.”
4. Follow response: “I want to follow the treatment by assessing her pain
(I will ask her to rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 every day), her temperature, and abdominal examination, and reassess her in 48 hours.”
In a similar patient, when the clinical presentation is unclear, perhaps the
best “next step” may be diagnostic in nature, such as laparoscopy to visualize
the tubes. This information is sometimes tested by the dictum, “the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute salpingitis is laparoscopy to visualize the tubes,
and particularly seeing purulent material drain from the tubes.”

Clinical Pearl
➤ Usually, the vague query, “What is your next step?” is the most difficult
question, because the answer may be diagnostic, staging, or therapeutic.

WHAT IS THE LIKELY MECHANISM FOR THIS PROCESS?
This question goes further than making the diagnosis, but also requires the
student to understand the underlying mechanism for the process. For example, a clinical scenario may describe an 18-year-old adolescent female at 24
weeks’ gestation who develops dyspnea 2 days after being treated for
pyelonephritis. The student must first diagnose the acute respiratory distress
syndrome, which often occurs 1 to 2 days after antibiotics are instituted.
Then, the student must understand that the endotoxins that arise from gramnegative organisms cause pulmonary injury, leading to capillary leakage of
fluid into the pulmonary interstitial space. The mechanism is, therefore,
endotoxin-induced “capillary leakage.” Answers that a student may also entertain, but would be less likely to be causative, include pneumonia, pulmonary
embolism, or pleural effusion.
The student is advised to learn the mechanisms for each disease process,
and not merely memorize a constellation of symptoms. In other words, rather

16

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

than solely committing to memorizing the classic presentation of pyelonephritis
(fever, flank tenderness, and pyuria), the student should understand that gramnegative rods, such as Escherichia coli, would ascend from the external genitalia
to the urethra to the bladder. From the bladder, the bacteria would ascend further
to the kidneys and cause an infection in the renal parenchyma. The involvement of the kidney now causes fever (vs an infection of only the bladder,
which usually does not induce a fever) and flank tenderness—a systemic
response not seen with lower urinary tract infection (ie, bacteriuria or cystitis).
Furthermore, the body’s reaction to the bacteria brings about leukocytes in
the urine (pyuria).

WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR THIS PROCESS?
Understanding the risk factors helps the practitioner to establish a diagnosis and
to determine how to interpret tests. For example, understanding the risk factor
analysis may help to manage a 55-year-old woman with postmenopausal bleeding after an endometrial biopsy shows no pathologic changes. If the woman does
not have any risk factors for endometrial cancer, the patient may be observed
because the likelihood for uterine malignancy is not so great. On the other hand,
if the same 55-year-old woman were diabetic, had a long history of anovulation
(irregular menses), was nulliparous, and was hypertensive, a practitioner should
pursue the postmenopausal bleeding further, even after a normal endometrial
biopsy. The physician may want to perform a hysteroscopy to visualize the
endometrial cavity directly and biopsy the abnormal-appearing areas. Thus, the
presence of risk factors helps to categorize the likelihood of a disease process.

Clinical Pearl
➤ When patients are at high risk for a disease, based on risk factors, more
testing may be indicated.

WHAT ARE THE COMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROCESS?
Clinicians must be cognizant of the complications of a disease, so that
they will understand how to follow and monitor the patient. Sometimes, the
student will have to make the diagnosis from clinical clues, and then
apply his or her knowledge of the consequences of the pathologic process.
For example, a woman who presents with lower abdominal pain, vaginal
discharge, and dyspareunia is first diagnosed as having pelvic inflammatory
disease or salpingitis (infection of the fallopian tubes). Long-term complications of this process would include ectopic pregnancy or infertility from tubal
damage. Understanding the types of consequences also helps the clinician to
be aware of the dangers to a patient. One life-threatening complication of a

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

17

tubo-ovarian abscess (which is the end-stage of a tubal infection leading to a
collection of pus in the region of the tubes and ovary) is rupture of the abscess.
The clinical presentation is shock with hypotension, and the appropriate
therapy is immediate surgery. In fact, not recognizing the rupture is commonly
associated with patient mortality. The student applies this information when
she or he sees a woman with a tubo-ovarian abscess on daily rounds, and monitors for hypotension, confusion, apprehension, and tachycardia. The clinician advises the team to be vigilant for any signs of abscess rupture, and to be
prepared to undertake immediate surgery should the need arise.

WHAT IS THE BEST THERAPY?
To answer this question, the clinician needs to reach the correct diagnosis,
and assess the severity of the condition, and then he or she must weigh the
situation to reach the appropriate intervention. For the student, knowing
exact dosages is not as important as understanding the best medication, the
route of delivery, mechanism of action, and possible complications. It is
important for the student to be able to verbalize the diagnosis and the rationale for the therapy. A common error is for the student to “jump to a treatment,”
like a random guess, and, therefore, he or she is given “right or wrong” feedback. In fact, the student’s guess may be correct, but for the wrong reason;
conversely, the answer may be a very reasonable one, with only one small
error in thinking. Instead, the student should verbalize the steps so that feedback may be given at every reasoning point.
For example, if the question is, “What is the best therapy for a 19-year-old
woman with a nontender ulcer of the vulva and painless adenopathy who is
pregnant at 12 weeks’ gestation?” the incorrect manner of response for the student to is to blurt out “azithromycin.” Rather, the student should reason it in
a way such as the following: “The most common cause of a nontender infectious ulcer of the vulva is syphilis. Painless adenopathy is usually associated.
In pregnancy, penicillin is the only effective therapy to prevent congenital
syphilis. Therefore, the best treatment for this woman with probable syphilis
is intramuscular penicillin (after confirming the diagnosis).”
A related question is, “What would have best prevented this condition?”
For instance, if the scenario presented is a 23-year-old woman with tubal factor infertility, then the most likely etiology is Chlamydia trachomatis cervicitis
which had ascended to the tubes causing damage. The best preventive measure
would be a barrier contraception such as condom use.

Clinical Pearl
➤ Therapy should be logical based on the severity of disease. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored for specific organism(s).

18

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

HOW WOULD YOU CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS?
In the previous scenario, the woman with a nontender vulvar ulcer is likely to
have syphilis. Confirmation can be achieved by serology (RPR or VDRL test)
and specific treponemal test; however, there is a significant possibility that
patients with primary syphilis may not have developed an antibody response
yet, and have negative serology. Thus, confirmation of the diagnosis would be
attained with darkfield microscopy. The student should strive to know the
limitations of various diagnostic tests, and the manifestations of disease.

Summary
1. There is no replacement for a meticulous history and physical examination.
2. There are four steps to the clinical approach to the patient: making the diagnosis, assessing severity, treating based on severity, and following response.
3. There are seven questions that help to bridge the gap between the textbook and the clinical arena.

Case 1
A 48-year-old G3 P3 woman complains of a 2-year history of loss of
urine four to five times each day, typically occurring with coughing,
sneezing, or lifting; she denies dysuria or the urge to void during these
episodes. These events cause her embarrassment and interfere with her
daily activities. The patient is otherwise in good health. A urine culture
performed 1 month previously was negative. On examination, she is
slightly obese. Her blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, her heart rate is
80 beats per minute, and her temperature 99°F (37.2°C). The breast
examination is normal without masses. Her heart has a regular rate and
rhythm without murmurs. The abdominal examination reveals no masses
or tenderness. A midstream voided urinalysis is unremarkable.

ANSWERS TO CASE 1:
Urinary Incontinence
Summary: A 48-year-old multiparous woman complains of urinary incontinence, which is related to stress activities. There is no urge component, and
no delay from the Valsalva maneuver to the loss of urine.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Genuine stress incontinence.

➤

Physical examination finding: Hypermobile urethra, cystocele, or loss of
urethrovesical angle.

➤

Best initial treatment: Kegel exercises and timed voiding.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Discern between the typical history of genuine stress urinary incontinence
(GSUI) versus urge urinary incontinence (UUI).
2. Know that the cystometric examination can be used to distinguish between
the two etiologies.
3. Know the treatments for both entities (GSUI and UUI).

Considerations
This patient’s history is very typical for genuine stress incontinence. She has loss
of urine concurrent with coughing, sneezing, or lifting. There is no urge component or a delay from cough as these findings would be consistent with urge
incontinence. There is no evidence of diabetes or a neuropathy, making overflow
incontinence unlikely. The pelvic examination likely reveals a cystocele (bladder bulging into the anterior vagina) or a loss of the normal bladder-urethral
angle (hypermobile urethra); both of these findings of pelvic relaxation may be
associated with the anatomic problem of GSUI, the bladder neck being below
the abdominal cavity. In patients with urge incontinence, or mixed symptoms
(loss of urine with Valsalva, and urge to void), cystometric examination can be
helpful to differentiate between genuine stress and urge incontinence. An accurate diagnosis is important, since the therapies for these two conditions are very
different, and surgical therapy may actually worsen urge incontinence.
With genuine stress urinary incontinence, initial treatment usually entails
pelvic floor strengthening exercises, called Kegel exercises. If this is unsuccessful, then options for treatment include urethropexy (surgical fixation of
the proximal urethra above the pelvic diaphragm, suburethral sling, or transobturator) or transvaginal fixation.

CLINICAL CASES

23

APPROACH TO
Urinary Incontinence
DEFINITIONS
URINARY INCONTINENCE: The involuntary loss of urine that is objectively demonstrable and creates social or hygienic concern.
GENUINE STRESS INCONTINENCE: Incontinence through the urethra due
to sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure, in the absence of bladder muscle spasm.
URGE INCONTINENCE: Loss of urine due to an uninhibited and sudden
bladder detrusor muscle contraction.
OVERFLOW INCONTINENCE: Loss of urine associated with an overdistended, hypotonic bladder in the absence of detrusor contractions. This is
often associated with diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injuries, or lower motor
neuropathies. It may also be caused by urethral edema after pelvic surgery.
CYSTOMETRIC EVALUATION: Investigation of pressure and volume
changes in the bladder with the filling of known volumes. It is often used to
discern between GSUI and UUI.
MIDURETHRAL SLING PROCEDURES: Supporting the midurethra with a
hammock-like effect, with procedures such as tensionless transvaginal tape
(TVT), or transobturator tape (TOT).
TRANSVAGINAL TAPE PROCEDURE: A minimally invasive procedure
used to fix the proximal urethra retropubic via a blind technique using a special hook-like instrument to place a synthehic tape under the urethra.
TRANSOBTURATOR TAPE PROCEDURE: A minimally invasive procedure
similar to the TVT but originating laterally to try to avoid the bladder or
bowel injuries that have been reported with the TVT procedures.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Normal Physiology
Urinary continence is maintained when the urethral pressure exceeds the
intravesicular (bladder) pressure. The bladder and proximal urethra are normally intra-abdominal in position, that is, above the pelvic diaphragm. In this
situation, a Valsalva maneuver transmits pressure to both the bladder and
proximal urethra so that continence is maintained. In the normal anatomic
situation, the urethral pressure exceeds the bladder pressure, and also the
pelvic diaphragm supports the bladder and urethra.

24

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Mechanisms of Incontinence
Genuine Stress Incontinence: Following trauma and/or other causes of weakness of the pelvic diaphragm (such as childbearing), the proximal urethra may
fall below the pelvic diaphragm. When the patient coughs, intra-abdominal
pressure is exerted to the bladder, but not to the proximal urethra. When the
bladder pressure equals or exceeds the maximal urethral pressure, urinary flow
occurs. Because this is a mechanical problem, the patient feels no urge to
void, and the loss of urine occurs simultaneously with coughing. There is no
delay from cough to incontinence. Urethropexy replaces the proximal urethra
back to its intra-abdominal position (Figure 1–1). More recently, narrow
strips of polypropylene mesh have been used to suspend the mid-urethra due
to the theory that urinary incontinence occurs due to pubourethral ligament
insufficiency. These procedures act as a hammock to support the urethra, and
also act to compress the urethra somewhat. These include various tension-free
vaginal tape procedures, and outcomes are favorable as compared to urethropexy. Because of the minimally invasive nature of these procedures, they
have gained popularity. Nevertheless, there is concern about erosion of the
synthetic material into the bladder or urethra prompting an FDA warning in
2008. A large NIH-funded study is being conducted to try to ascertain which
procedure is best to treat GSUI.
Urge Incontinence: With uninhibited spasms of the detrusor muscle, the
bladder pressure overcomes the urethral pressure. Dysuria and/or the urge to
void are prominent symptoms, reflecting the bladder spasms. Sometimes,
coughing or sneezing can provoke a bladder spasm, so that a delay of several
seconds is noted before urine loss.
Overflow Incontinence: With an overdistended bladder, coughing will increase
the bladder pressure and eventually lead to dribbling or small loss of urine.

Work-up
The history, physical examination, urinalysis, and postvoid residual are part of
the initial evaluation of urinary incontinence (Table 1–1).
Behavior therapy, including timed voiding, and pelvic musculature strengthening, seem to have a role and generally should be the first line of treatment.

Comprehension Questions
1.1

A 55-year-old woman notes constant wetness from her vagina following
a total vaginal hysterectomy procedure, which she had undergone
2 months previously. She denies dysuria or urgency to void. The urinanalysis is normal. Which of the following is the best method to diagnose the etiology of urinary incontinence?
A. Cystometric examination
B. Dye instillation into bladder
C. Postvoid catheterization of the bladder
D. Neurological profile of the sacral nerves

Match the following single best therapy (A-G) that will most likely help in the
clinical situation described (1.2-1.4):
A. Burch urethropexy
B. Oxybutynin (Ditropan, an anticholinergic medication)
C. Placement of ureteral stents
D. Surgical repair of the fistulous tract
E. Propranolol (inderal)
F. Placement of an artificial urethral sphincter
G. Intermittent self-catheterization
1.2

A 42-year-old woman with long-standing diabetes mellitus complains
of small amounts of constant dribbling of urine loss with coughing or
lifting.

1.3

A 39-year-old woman wets her underpants two to three times each
day. She feels as though she needs to void, but cannot make it to the
restroom in time.

1.4

A 35-year-old woman has undergone four vaginal deliveries. She notes
urinary loss six to seven times a day concurrently with coughing or sneezing. She denies dysuria or an urge to void. Her urine culture is negative.

ANSWERS
1.1

B. This patient likely has a vesicovaginal (between bladder and
vagina) fistula from the surgery. A dye instilled into the bladder
would be seen leaking into the vagina. If the leakage is slow, sometimes a tampon is placed into the vagina and removed after 30 to
60 minutes. Constant wetness after a pelvic operation suggests a fistula, such as vesicovaginal fistula, which is best treated with surgical
repair. This situation is best treated with surgical repair since it is an
anatomic problem. Medications would not be helpful in this situation. The operation would include excision of the fistulous tract

28

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

which usually may be infected or weakened, and then closure of the
opening. Other common fistulae that may occur after pelvic surgery
include ureterovaginal (between ureter and vagina) and rectovaginal
fistulas (between rectum and vagina).
1.2

G. This patient has long-standing diabetes mellitus, which is a risk
factor for a neurogenic bladder, leading to overflow incontinence.
Other causes include spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. These
patients generally do not feel the urge to void and accumulate
large amounts of urine in their bladders. The best therapy for overflow incontinence (neurogenic bladder) is intermittent selfcatheterization. Neither surgery (indicated for fistula repair), nor
Burch urethropexy (indicated for genuine stress incontinence)
would be appropriate for this scenario because it is not an anatomic
problem. The medications listed would also not be indicated for neurogenic bladder, however, Bethanechol is a commonly prescribed
drug to help stimulate bladder contractions by selectively acting on
muscarinic receptors in the bladder muscles in individuals with overflow incontinence.

1.3

B. This woman’s prominent urge component makes urge incontinence
the most likely diagnosis, best treated with anticholinergic medications. Anticholinergics relax the overactive detrusor muscle. Surgery
would not be indicated in this situation, and in fact, may worsen the
situation by further damaging nerves and muscles of the bladder. An
artificial urethral sphincter would not improve the patient’s symptoms
because the problem has to do with the detrusor muscle, and not the
urethral sphincter. The patient is not having a problem with overflow,
so self-catheterization would not be helpful either.

1.4

A. This clinical presentation is consistent with GSUI and is best
treated by urethropexy. There is some evidence that vaginal deliveries may increase the incidence of GSUI due to trauma to the pelvic
diaphragm. The medications listed would not be indicated for this
patient because her symptoms are due to a weakening of the pelvic
diaphragm versus a problem with the bladder itself, or muscles of the
bladder, as with urge incontinence. Unlike urge incontinence, the
patient feels no urge to void, and there is no delay noted before urine
loss after a cough or sneeze. A cytometric or urodynamic evaluation
helps to differentiate between urge and genuine stress incontinence.

CLINICAL CASES

29

Clinical Pearls
➤ The primary treatment of genuine stress incontinence is surgical, whereas
the best treatment of urge incontinence is medical.
➤ Although midurethral sling procedures have emerged as the most commonly performed procedures to treat GSUI, it is unclear that they are the
best procedures.
➤ Cystometric or urodynamic evaluation helps to differentiate genuine from
urge incontinence.
➤ A postvoid catheterization showing a large residual volume suggests overflow incontinence.
➤ Loss of urine occurs when the intravesicular pressure equals (or exceeds)
the sphincter pressure.

Case 2
A 66-year-old woman comes in for a routine physical examination. Her
menopause occurred at age 51 years, and she is currently taking an estrogen pill along with a progestin pill each day. The past medical history is
unremarkable. Her family history includes one maternal cousin with
ovarian cancer. On examination, she is found to have a blood pressure
of 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and temperature of
98°F (36.6°C). She weighs 140 lb and is 5 ft 4 in tall. The thyroid is normal to palpation. Examination of her breasts reveals no masses or discharge. The abdominal, cardiac, and lung evaluations are within normal
limits. The pelvic examination shows a normal, multiparous cervix, a
normal-sized uterus, and no adnexal masses. She had undergone mammography 3 months previously.

ANSWERS TO CASE 2:
Health Maintenance, Age 66 Years
Summary: A 66-year-old woman presents for health maintenance. A mammogram has been performed 3 months previously.
➤

Next step: Each of the following should be performed: Stool for occult
blood, colonoscopy or barium enema/flexible sigmoidoscopy, pneumococcal
vaccine, influenza vaccine, tetanus vaccine (if not within 10 years), cholesterol screening, fasting blood sugar, thyroid function tests, bone mineral
density screening, and urinalysis.

➤

Most common cause of mortality: Cardiovascular disease.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand which health maintenance studies should be performed for a
66-year-old woman.
2. Know the most common cause of mortality for a woman in this age group.
3. Understand that preventive maintenance consists of cancer screening,
immunizations, and screening for common diseases.

Considerations
The approach to health maintenance includes three parts: (1) cancer screening,
(2) immunizations, and (3) addressing common diseases for the particular
patient group. For a 66-year-old woman, this includes annual mammography
for breast cancer screening, colon cancer screening (annual stool test for
occult blood and either intermittent colonoscopy or barium enema/flexible
sigmoidoscopy), tetanus booster every 10 years, the pneumococcal vaccine,
and a yearly influenza immunization. Screening for hypercholesterolemia
every 5 years up to age 75 years, thyroid function testing every 5 years, and
fasting blood sugar levels every 3 years are also recommended. Because urosepsis is common in geriatric patients, a urinalysis is also usually performed.
Osteoporosis screening is indicated for women over the age of 65. Finally, the
most common cause of mortality in a woman in this age group is cardiovascular disease.

33

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Health Maintenance in Older Women
DEFINITIONS
SCREENING TEST: A device used to identify asymptomatic disease in the hope

that early detection will lead to an improved outcome. An optimal screening test
has high sensitivity and specificity, is inexpensive, and is easy to perform.
PRIMARY PREVENTION: Identifying and modifying risk factors in people
who have never had the disease of concern.
SECONDARY PREVENTION: Actions taken to reduce morbidity or mortality once a disease has been diagnosed.
COST EFFECTIVENESS: A comparison of resources expended (dollars) in an
intervention versus the benefit, which may be measured in life-years, or
quality-adjusted life years.

CLINICAL APPROACH
In each age group, particular screening tests are recommended (Table 2–1).

Rationale
When the patient does not have any apparent disease or complaint, then the
goal of medical intervention is disease prevention. One method of targeting diseases is by using the patient’s age. For example, the most common cause of death
for a 16-year-old person is a motor vehicle accident; hence the teenage patient
would be well served by the physician encouraging him or her to wear seat belts
and to avoid alcohol intoxication when driving. In contrast, a 56-year-old
woman will most likely die of cardiovascular disease, so the physician should
focus on exercise, weight loss, and screening for hyperlipidemia. In a woman
beyond 65 years of age, if prior Pap smears have been normal cervical cancer
screening is not cost-effective. Patients who have had a total hysterectomy
(removal of uterine corpus and cervix) do not require vaginal cytology (Pap
smears) as long as the patient had no history of cervical dysplasia.

Comprehension Questions
2.1

A 59-year-old woman is being seen for a health maintenance appointment. She has not seen a doctor for over 10 years. She had undergone
a total hysterectomy for uterine fibroids 12 years ago. The patient
takes supplemental calcium. The physician orders a fasting glucose
level, lipid panel, mammogram, colonoscopy, and a Pap smear of the
vaginal cuff. Which of the following statements is most accurate
regarding the screening for this patient?
A. The Pap smear of the vaginal cuff is unnecessary.
B. In general colon cancer screening should be initiated at age 60
but this patient has very sporadic care, therefore colonoscopy is
reasonable.
C. Because the patient takes supplemental calcium, a DEXA scan is
not needed.
D. Pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended.

2.2

A 63-year-old woman has had annual health maintenance appointments and has followed all the recommendations offered by her physician. The physician counsels her about varicella zoster vaccine. Which
of the following is the most accurate statement about this vaccine?
A. This vaccine is recommended for patients who are aged 50 and older.
B. This vaccine is not recommended if a patient has already developed the shingles.
C. This vaccine is a live attenuated immunization.
D. This vaccine has some cross-reactivity with herpes simplex virus
and offers some protection against HSV.

2.3

An 18-year-old adolescent female is being seen for a health maintenance appointment. She has not had a Pap smear previously. She currently takes oral contraceptive pills. She began sexual intercourse 1 year
previously. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding health maintenance for this individual?
A. A Pap smear should not be performed in this patient at this time.
B. The HPV vaccine should be administered only if she has a history
of genital warts.
C. The most common cause of mortality for this patient would be
suicide.
D. Hepatitis C vaccination should be offered to this patient.

ANSWERS
2.1

A. Cervical cytology of the vaginal cuff is unnecessary when the hysterectomy was for benign indications (not cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer), and when there is no history of abnormal Pap smears.

36

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Colon cancer screening is generally started at age 50. DEXA scan for
osteoporosis screening should be considered in any postmenopausal
woman at risk, such as having an osteoporosis-related fracture, a family history, or being thin and Caucasian. Pneumococcal vaccine is
generally given at age 65.
2.2

C. The varicella zoster vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, recommended for individuals aged 60 and above, and has been shown to
greatly reduce the incidence of herpes zoster (shingles), and the
severity and likelihood of post-herpetic neuralgia. It has no efficacy
in preventing HSV.

2.3

A. Cervical cytology should be deferred until age 21 or 3 years after
initiation of sexual intercourse. This is due to the fact that adolescents
many times will clear the HPV infection, and cause an abnormal Pap
smear to normalized. The HPV vaccine should be recommended to all
females between the age of 9 and 26, regardless of exposures. The most
common cause of mortality for adolescent females is motor vehicle
accidents. The hepatitis C vaccine is currently not available, but
hopefully in several years, it may be developed.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The basic approach to health maintenance is threefold: (1) cancer screening, (2) age-appropriate immunizations, and (3) screening for common
diseases.
➤ The most common cause of mortality in a woman younger than 20 years
is motor vehicle accidents.
➤ The most common cause of mortality of a woman older than 39 years is
cardiovascular disease.
➤ Major conditions in women aged 65 years and older include osteoporosis,
heart disease, breast cancer, and depression.
➤ Cervical cytology screening does not appear to be cost-effective in
women older than age 65 when prior Pap smears have been normal.

Case 3
After a 4-hour labor, a 31-year-old G4 P3 woman undergoes an uneventful vaginal delivery of a 7 lb 8 oz infant over an intact perineum. During
her labor, she is noted to have mild variable decelerations and accelerations that increase 20 beats per minute (bpm) above the baseline heart
rate. At delivery, the male baby has Apgar scores of 8 at 1 minute, and
9 at 5 minute. Slight lengthening of the cord occurs after 28 minute
along with a small gush of blood per vagina. As the placenta is being
delivered, a shaggy, reddish, bulging mass is noted at the introitus
around the placenta.

ANSWERS TO CASE 3:
Uterine Inversion
Summary: A 31-year-old G4 P3 woman has a normal vaginal delivery of her
baby, and after slight lengthening of the cord, a reddish mass is noted bulging
in the introitus.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Uterine inversion.

➤

Most likely complication: Postpartum hemorrhage.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the signs of spontaneous placental separation.
2. Recognize the clinical presentation of uterine inversion.
3. Understand that the most common cause of uterine inversion is undue
traction of the cord before placental separation.

Considerations
This patient’s history reveals that the first and second stages of labor are normal. The third stage of labor (placental delivery) reaches close to the upper
limits of normal. The evidence for placental separation is never definite. The
four signs of placental separation are: (1) gush of blood, (2) lengthening of the
cord, (3) globular and firm shape of the uterus, and (4) the uterus rises up to
the anterior abdominal wall. In this case, although there is not good evidence
for placental separation, traction on the cord is exerted, which results in an
inverted uterus. The reddish bulging mass noted adjacent to the placenta is
the endometrial surface; hence, the mass will have a shaggy appearance and
be all around the placenta. Other masses and/or organs may at times prolapse,
such as vaginal or cervical tissue, but these will have a smooth appearance.

Inverted Uterus

UTERINE INVERSION: A “turning inside out” of the uterus; whereupon the

SIGNS OF PLACENTAL SEPARATION: Cord lengthening, gush of blood,

globular uterine shape, and uterus lifting up to the anterior abdominal wall.

Figure 3–1. Inverted uterus. Uterine inversion can occur when excessive umbilical cord traction is exerted on a fundally implanted, unseparated placenta (A). Upon
recognition, the operator attempts to reposition the inverted uterus using cupped
fingers (B).

40

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

CLINICAL APPROACH
After a vaginal delivery, 95% of women experience spontaneous placenta
separation within 30 minutes. Because the uterus and placenta are no
longer joined, the placenta is usually in the lower segment of the uterus,
just inside the cervix, and the uterus is often contracted. The umbilical
cord lengthens due to the placenta having dropped into the lower portion
of the uterus. The gush of blood represents bleeding from the placental
bed, usually coinciding with placental separation. If the placenta has not
separated, excessive force on the cord may lead to uterine inversion.
Massive hemorrhage usually results; thus, in this situation, the practitioner must be prepared for rapid volume replacement. Although it was
classically taught by some that the shock was out of proportion to the
actual amount of blood loss, this is not the case. In other words, shock is
due to massive hemorrhage.
The best method of averting a uterine inversion is to await spontaneous
separation from the placenta from the uterus before placing traction on the
umbilical cord. Even after one or two of the signs of placental separation are
present, the operator should be cautious not to put undue tension on the
cord. At times, part of the placenta may separate, revealing the gush of
blood, but the remaining attached placenta may induce a uterine inversion
or traumatic severing of the cord. The grand-multiparous patient with the
placenta implanted in the fundus (top of uterus) is at particular risk for uterine inversion. A placenta accreta, an abnormally adherent placenta, is also
a risk factor.

Treatment
With the diagnosis of an inverted uterus, immediate assistance—including
that of an anesthesiologist—is essential because a uterine relaxation anesthetic agent, such as halothane (for uterine replacement), and/or emergency
surgery may be necessary. If the placenta has already separated, the recently
inverted uterus may sometimes be replaced by using the gloved palm and
cupped fingers. Two intravenous lines should be started as soon as possible
and preferably prior to placental separation, since profuse hemorrhage may
follow placental removal. Terbutaline or magnesium sulfate can also be utilized to relax the uterus if necessary prior to uterine replacement. Upon
replacing the uterine fundus to the normal location, the relaxation agents are
stopped, and then uterotonic agents, such as oxytocin, are given. Placement
of the clinician’s fist inside the uterus to maintain the normal structure of the
uterus is important.
Note: Even with optimal treatment of uterine inversion, hemorrhage is
almost a certainty.

baby boy vaginally. Upon delivery of the placenta, there was noted to
be an inverted uterus, which was successfully managed including
replacement of the uterus. Which of the following placental implantation sites would most likely predispose to an inverted uterus?
A. Fundal
B. Anterior
C. Posterior
D. Lateral
E. Lower segment

3.2

A 24-year-old woman underwent a normal vaginal delivery of a term

30 minutes. Which of the following would be the next step for this patient?
A. Initiate oxytocin.
B. Wait for an additional 30 minutes.
C. Hysterectomy.
D. Attempt a manual extraction of the placenta.
E. Misoprostol estrogen intravaginally.

3.3

A 32-year-old G1 P0 woman at 40 weeks’ gestation undergoes a normal
vaginal delivery. Delivery of the placenta is complicated by an inverted
uterus, with subsequent hemorrhage leading to 1500 mL of blood loss.
She is managed with a transfusion of erythrocytes. Which of the following is the best explanation of the mechanism of hemorrhage?
A. Inverted uterus stretches the uterus, causing trauma to blood vessels
leading to bleeding.
B. Inverted uterus leads to inability for an adequate myometrial contraction effect.
C. Inverted uterus causes a local coagulopathic reaction to the uterus
and endometrium.
D. Inverted uterus causes muscular abrasions and lacerations leading
to bleeding.

3.4

A 33-year-old G5 P5 woman, who is being induced for preeclampsia
delivers a 9 lb baby. Upon delivery of the placenta, uterine inversion is
noted. The physician attempts to replace the uterus, but the cervix is
tightly contracted, preventing the fundus of the uterus from being repositioned. Which of the following is the best therapy for this patient?
A. Vaginal hysterectomy.
B. Dührssen incisions of the cervix.
C. Halothane anesthesia.
D. Discontinue the magnesium sulfate.
E. Infuse oxytocin intravenously.

42

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
3.1

A. A fundally implanted placenta predisposes to uterine inversion.
A placenta implanted in either the anterior, posterior, lateral, or
lower segment of the uterus does not have the direct angle that a fundally implanted placenta has through the cervix and out the vagina.
The best method for preventing inversion is to await spontaneous
separation of the placenta from the uterus before placing traction on
the umbilical cord.

3.2

D. After 30 minutes, the placenta is abnormally retained, and a manual extraction is generally attempted. Waiting for another 30 minutes
may lead to maternal hemorrhage, which may then lead to an indication for a hysterectomy. However, a hysterectomy would not be the
initial step after 30 minutes have passed during the third stage of
labor. Oxytocin should not be given until the uterine fundus is
placed back to its normal location. Oxytocin is a uterotonic agent
that aids in allowing the uterus to contract down on itself in an effort
to stop bleeding after the placenta has been removed. Intravaginal
estrogen is not indicated for this scenario and is typically prescribed
to patient with vaginal atrophy.

3.3

B. An inverted uterus makes it impossible for the uterus to establish
its normal tone, and to contract. Thus, the myometrial fibers do not
exert their normal tourniquet effect on the spiral arteries. The
endometrial placental bed pours out blood, which previously had
been perfusing the intervillous space. Thus, uterine atony is the most
common reason for hemorrhage in inverted uterus. The muscle of
the uterus and the vasculature is seldom damaged. Replacing the
uterus to its normal position and assisting tonicity of the uterus will
alleviate the bleeding.

3.4

C. A uterine relaxing agent (such as halothane anesthesia) is the
best initial therapy for a nonreducible uterus. Terbutaline and
magnesium sulfate can also be used to relax the uterus if necessary.
Oxytocin is a uterotonic agent and may be used following replacement of the uterine fundus to its normal location. Dührssen incisions are used to treat the entrapped fetal head of a breech vaginal
delivery and would not be indicated for uterine inversion. A vaginal hysterectomy would not be the best treatment option for this
patient either.

CLINICAL CASES

Clinical Pearls
➤ Although it can occur spontaneously, one of the most common causes of
inverted uterus is undue traction on the cord when the placenta has not
yet separated.
➤ The signs of placental separation are (1) gush of blood, (2) lengthening
of the cord, (3) globular-shaped uterus, and (4) the uterus rising to the
anterior abdominal wall.
➤ Hemorrhage is a common complication of an inverted uterus.
➤ The upper limit of normal for the third stage of labor (time between delivery
of the infant to delivery of the placenta) is 30 minutes.
➤ When the placenta does not deliver spontaneously after 30 minutes, then
a manual extraction of the placenta should be attempted.

Case 4
A 49-year-old woman complains of irregular menses over the past 6 months,
feelings of inadequacy, vaginal dryness, difficulty sleeping, and episodes
of warmth and sweating at night. On examination, her blood pressure is
120/68 mm Hg, heart rate is 90 beats per minute, and temperature is
99°F (37.2°C). Her thyroid gland is normal to palpation. The cardiac
and lung examinations are unremarkable. The breasts are symmetric,
without masses or discharge. Examination of the external genitalia does
not reveal any masses.

ANSWERS TO CASE 4:
Perimenopause
Summary: A 49-year-old woman complains of irregular menses, feelings of
inadequacy, sleeplessness, and episodes of warmth and sweating.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Climacteric (perimenopausal state).

➤

Next diagnostic step: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
luteinizing hormone (LH).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the normal clinical presentation of women in the perimenopausal
state.
2. Understand that elevated serum FSH and LH levels help to confirm the
diagnosis.
3. Know that estrogen replacement therapy is usually effective in treating the
hot flushes.
4. Know the risks of continuous estrogen-progestin therapy.

Considerations
This 49-year-old woman complains of irregular menses, feelings of inadequacy, and intermittent sensations of warmth and sweating. This constellation of symptoms is consistent with the perimenopause, or climacteric state.
Between the age of 40 and 51 years, the majority of women begin to experience symptoms of hypoestrogenemia, primarily hot flushes. Hot flushes,
which are the typical vasomotor change due to decreased estrogen levels, are
associated with skin temperature elevation and sweating lasting for 2 to 4 minutes.
The low estrogen concentration also has an effect on the vagina by decreasing the epithelial thickness, leading to atrophy and dryness. Elevated serum
FSH and LH levels are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of the perimenopause. Treatment for hot flushes includes estrogen replacement therapy
with progestin. When a woman still has her uterus, the addition of progestin
to estrogen replacement is important in preventing endometrial cancer.
Note: The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene, does
not treat hot flushes.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Menopause
DEFINITIONS
MENOPAUSE: The point in time in a woman’s life when there is cessation
of menses due to follicular atresia occurring after age 40 years (mean age
51 years).
PERIMENOPAUSE (CLIMACTERIC): The transitional 2 to 4 years spanning
from immediately before to immediately after the menopause.
HOT FLUSHES: Irregular unpredictable episodes of increased skin temperature and sweating lasting about 3 to 4 minutes caused by vasomotor changes.
PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE: The cessation of ovarian function due
to atresia of follicles prior to age 40 years. At ages younger than 30 years,
autoimmune diseases or karyotypic abnormalities should be considered.

CLINICAL APPROACH
At about 47 years of age, most women experience perimenopausal symptoms
due to the ovaries’ impending failure. Symptoms include irregular menses due
to anovulatory cycles; vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes; and decreased
estrogen and androgen levels. Because ovarian inhibin levels are decreased,
FSH and LH levels rise even before estradiol levels fall. The decreased estradiol
concentrations lead to vaginal atrophy, bone loss, and vasomotor symptoms.
While most clinicians agree that estrogen replacement therapy is currently the
best treatment for the vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis, scientific data raises concerns about the risks of this therapy. The Women’s Health
Initiative Study of continuous estrogen-progestin treatment reported a small
but significant increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease, pulmonary
embolism, and stroke. Women on hormone replacement therapy had fewer
fractures and a lower incidence of colon cancer.
It should be noted that there is no evidence of adverse effects from shortterm (<6 months) estrogen therapy for the acute relief of menopausal symptoms. Currently, hormone replacement therapy is indicated for vasomotor
symptoms, and should be used for as short a duration as possible in the smallest dose. For women who cannot or choose not to take estrogen, the antihypertensive agent clonidine may help with the vasomotor symptoms. A selective
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), such as raloxifene, is helpful in preventing bone loss, but does not alter the hot flushes. Weight-bearing exercise,
calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and estrogen replacement are

48

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

important cornerstones in maintaining bone mass. Because the FSH responds
to the inhibin and not to estrogen, the FSH level cannot be used to titrate the
estrogen replacement dose. In other words, the FSH concentration is still elevated even though the estrogen replacement may be sufficient.
Other diseases that are important to consider in the perimenopausal woman
include hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and breast cancer.
Women in this stage of life may also experience depression, whether spontaneous in its onset or situational due to grief or midlife adjustments. The practitioner should advocate aerobic exercise at least three times a week, again, with
weight-bearing exercise being advantageous for the prevention of osteoporosis.
Bone mineral density (BMD) testing, such as by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), is useful in the early identification of osteoporosis and osteopenia. BMD testing is indicated for all postmenopausal women aged 65 years or
older and postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis and presenting with a
bone fracture. Alcohol abuse may be seen in up to 10% of postmenopausal
women, and requires clinical suspicion to establish the diagnosis.

A 25-year-old woman has a history of 1 year of amenorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia. She has bilateral galactorrhea due to a prolactin-secreting
adenoma. Which of the following tests is also likely to reveal an abnormal finding?
A. DEXA scan of the spine
B. Endometrial biopsy
C. Mammography of the breasts
D. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level

ANSWERS
4.1

C. Ovarian failure due to follicular atresia is the reason for oligoovulation in the perimenopausal years. During perimenopause (or
climacteric), follicular atresia occurs from hypoestrogenemia, as do
the vasomotor changes that lead to hot flushes. There is nothing dysfunctional occurring in this scenario, as it is a common occurrence in
a perimenopausal patient.

4.2

F. Both hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia may cause hypothalamic dysfunction, which inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulsations, which in turn inhibit pituitary FSH and LH
release. The lack of gonadotropins, FSH and LH, leads to hypoestrogenic amenorrhea. A common cause of hyperprolactinemia in a girl
of this age is a prolactinoma. This is not a pituitary problem, nor a
receptor insensitivity issue. There is no pathology related to the
ovaries, however this patient will most likely be amenorrheic due to
the lack of stimulation to the ovaries by the gonadotropins.

4.3

G. This patient most likely has polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
Women with PCOS often are obese and hirsute, have anovulation and
insulin resistance, but an estrogen excess. Because of this, they are often
prescribed progesterone alone or combination oral contraceptive pills
to induce vaginal bleeding and to prevent endometrial hyperplasia.

4.4

C. Ovarian failure is the most likely etiology in this woman with probable Turner syndrome (45,X). It would be reflected by elevated
gonadotropin levels and streaked ovaries. She most likely has decreased
estrogen levels as well, which predisposes her to complications such as
osteoporosis later in life. This patient’s symptoms result from a chromosomal abnormality and not a hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction.

4.5

F. Excessive exercise may lead to hypothalamic dysfunction, but
many times simple weight gain will lead to its restoration of function.
This patient has amenorrhea, and therefore is in a hypoestrogenic
state. This puts this patient at an increased risk of bone fractures.
Many times these individuals are placed on OCPs in order to maintain

50

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

normal hypothalamic function. There is no pathology related to the
ovaries or pituitary in this scenario.
4.6

B. Sheehan syndrome is when the anterior pituitary suffers from
hemorrhagic necrosis associated with postpartum hemorrhage. She is
unable to breastfeed due to her inability to release prolactin from the
anterior pituitary. This patient’s symptoms are unrelated to the
ovaries and hypothalamus. This patient would be in a hypoestrogenic state due to the lack of gonadotropin stimulation. Treatment
for this would be supplemental hormonal replacement.

4.7

A. Amenorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia causes a hypoestrogenic
state due to decreased GnRH release, and decreased FSH and LH
secretion. Ovarian estrogen levels are decreased, leading to decreased
bone mineral density. Hence the DEXA scan is most likely to be
abnormal. The endometrial biopsy is likely to be normal, or perhaps
show atrophic changes due to the hypoestrogenic state, and certainly
not likely to show hyperplasia or cancer. The mammogram would not
be affected. The thyroid gland is not affected by hyperprolactinemia;
rather, hypothyroidism can lead to hyperprolactinemia, not vice versa.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Hot flushes and irregular menses after the age of 45 years are most likely
due to the climacteric, and the symptoms usually respond to estrogen
replacement therapy.
➤ The current indication for hormone replacement therapy in the
menopausal woman is significant vasomotor symptoms, and the lowest
dose should be used for the shortest duration feasible.
➤ The most common location of an osteoporosis-associated fracture is the
thoracic spine as a compression fracture.
➤ Weight-bearing exercise, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and
estrogen replacement therapy are the important cornerstones in the prevention of osteoporosis.
➤ Progestin should be added to estrogen replacement therapy when a
woman has her uterus, to prevent endometrial cancer.
➤ Continuous estrogen-progestin therapy may be associated with a small
but significant risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer.

Case 5
A 28-year-old woman who underwent a cesarean delivery 1 week ago is
brought into the emergency room with a blood pressure of 60/40 mm Hg.
The patient’s husband states that she had 2 days of nausea and vomiting, fever to 102°F (38.8°C), and myalgias. The reason for the cesarean
was arrest of active phase, with cervical dilation at 5 cm for 3 hours
despite strong uterine contractions. She was discharged home on postoperative day 3 in good condition. On examination, the patient appears
lethargic and has mental confusion. Auscultation of her heart reveals
tachycardia. The lung examination demonstrates slight crackles at the
lung bases. The abdomen is tender throughout, and the fundus of the
uterus is slightly tender. The skin incision is tender, red, and indurated.
Upon opening the incision, purulent material is expressed. The underlying tissue is palpated and has a brawny texture with crepitance noted.
The laboratory evaluation reveals a hemoglobin level of 15 g/dL and a
serum creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 5:
Necrotizing Fasciitis
Summary: A 28-year-old woman has fever to 102°F (38.8°C), myalgias,
vomiting, hypotension, confusion, and a skin incision that is infected with
underlying tissue revealing brawny and crepitance. She has evidence of hemoconcentration and renal insufficiency.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Necrotizing fasciitis.

➤

Next step in therapy: Isotonic intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and immediate surgical debridement.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the manifestations of shock.
2. Understand that necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but potentially fatal infection
that can affect patients.
3. Understand that aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics,
and immediate surgical debridement are fundamental in the treatment of
necrotizing fasciitis.

Considerations
This patient presents with multiple life-threatening issues. First the hypotension must be recognized, since her blood pressure is 60/40 mm Hg. Her mean
arterial pressure is 47 mm Hg, which is insufficient to maintain cerebral perfusion. Regardless of the etiology, the blood pressure needs to be supported
immediately. Because the patient has a fever of 102°F (38.8°C) with hypotension, and no history of hemorrhage or postpartum bleeding, septic shock is the
most likely diagnosis. The first step in resuscitation should therefore be
addressed at supporting the blood pressure, with aggressive use of intravenous
isotonic fluids. A Foley catheter measuring urine output can help to assess
urine output and indirectly kidney perfusion, particularly since the patient has
an elevated serum creatinine level. The goal is to keep the mean arterial
blood pressure at least 65 mm Hg to perfuse her vital organs. Ideally, this
patient would have a urine output of at least 25 to 30 mL/h (depending on the
degree of renal insufficiency). Furthermore, this woman most likely has necrotizing fasciitis since she has the wound infection complicated by the underlying
tissue having an abnormal consistency upon palpation. The crepitance is due
to gas in the soft tissue. This is likely due to anaerobic bacteria. Her myalgias,
fever, nausea, and vomiting indicate the systemic nature of the infection.

55

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Necrotizing Fasciitis
DEFINITIONS
NECROTIZING FASCIITIS: A serious infection of the muscle and fascia

usually caused by multiple organisms or anaerobes. It can involve surgical infections, traumatic injury, or rarely Group A Streptococci (flesh-eating bacteria).
GROUP A STREPTOCOCCAL TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME: Rapidly progressing infection of the episiotomy or cesarean delivery incision (“flesheating bacteria” syndrome).
SHOCK: Condition of circulatory insufficiency where tissue perfusion needs
are not met.
SEPTIC SHOCK: Circulatory insufficiency due to infection or the body’s
response to infection, commonly caused by gram-negative endotoxins.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) = [(2 × Diastolic blood pressure) +
(1 × Systolic blood pressure)]/3

CLINICAL APPROACH
The management of septic shock includes copious intravenous fluids with close
monitoring of urine output and blood pressure. At times, invasive hemodynamic monitoring with a central venous catheter or Swan-Ganz line is needed.
Intravenous antibiotics should be broad spectrum to include penicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole or other anaerobic agent, and dopamine or dobutamine are sometimes required when fluids alone are insufficient to maintain the
blood pressure. Addressing the underlying etiology of the septic shock is important. When dealing with an aggressive wound infection, immediate surgical
debridement, sometimes very radical or wide excisional procedures, is warranted. Necrotic and infected tissue must be removed, and sometimes requires
multiple surgeries. Monitoring of blood pressure, heart ratio, oxygen saturation,
urine output, and neutral status is important. Once the patient is stabilized,
treating the underlying cause typically leads to resolution. Septic shock initially
presents as decreased urine output and if untreated, proceeds to ischemia of vital
organs and death.

A. Cardiac contractility dysfunction
B. Cardiac bradycardia
C. Third spacing of fluid
D. Vasodilation

5.2

A 45-year-old woman is noted to have a surgical incision site that is

A. Redness of the surgical incision
B. Induration and edema of the surgical incision
C. Gas in the surgical tissue
D. Gram-negative rods growing from blood culture

5.3

A 30-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department with
fever and a blood pressure of 70/40 mm Hg. She is presumed to be in
septic shock. Which of the following is a fundamental principle for the
treatment?
A. Intravenous normal saline
B. Plasmapheresis
C. Oral fluid resuscitation
D. Await blood culture results prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy

ANSWERS
5.1

D. The pathophysiology of septic shock is vasodilation usually
due to endotoxins, although at times, such as with Staphylococcus
aureus (toxic shock syndrome), exotoxins can be causative. The
vasodilation leads to hypotension, and is treated with IV fluids.
If the IV fluids are insufficient to produce a correction in hypotension, then vasoconstrictors are indicated, such as dopamine. Late
in the course of septic shock, cardiac dysfunction can occur; however,
at this stage, the patient is typically in a near terminal condition.

5.2

C. Gas in the muscle or fascia is indicative of necrotizing fasciitis,
likely due to a clostridial species. Induration and redness of the surgical wound is suggestive of a superficial wound infection, in which
the skin and subcutaneous tissue is infected. This is a superficial surgical site infection, and needs to be opened. The superficial wound

CLINICAL CASES

57

infection is not as life-threatening as when a deep surgical site infection occurs.
5.3

A. Intravenous isotonic fluids are the initial treatment of choice
for septic shock. The cornerstones of therapy include removing the
nidus of infection, antibiotic therapy, and support of the blood pressure. Plasmapheresis is not a major part of the treatment of septic
shock.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The cornerstones of treatment of septic shock include aggressive intravenous fluids, source control, antibiotic therapy, and monitoring perfusion
and organ function.
➤ Source control in septic shock means removing the etiology of the
infection.
➤ The sunburn-like rash and/or desquamation is typical for S aureus
infections.
➤ The initial antibiotic therapy for serious S aureus infections is generally intravenous nafcillin or methicillin unless methicillin resistance is suspected, in
which case vancomycin is used.
➤ Hypotension that persists despite intravenous isotonic fluid replacement
generally requires pressor support such as with intravenous infusion of
dopamine.

Case 6
A 26-year-old G1 P0 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation is admitted to the
hospital in labor. She is noted to have uterine contractions every 7 to
10 minutes. Her antepartum history is significant for a nonimmune
rubella status. On examination, her blood pressure (BP) is 110/70 mm Hg,
and heart rate (HR) is 80 beats per minute (bpm). The estimated fetal
weight is 7 lb. On pelvic examination, she has been noted to have a
change in cervical examinations from 4-cm dilation to 7 cm over the last
2 hours. The pelvis is assessed to be adequate on digital examination.

ANSWER TO CASE 6:
Labor (Normal Active Phase)
Summary: A 26-year-old G1 P0 woman at term with an adequate pelvis on
clinical pelvimetry, nonimmune rubella status, is in labor. Her cervix has
changed from 4-cm to 7-cm dilation over 2 hours with uterine contractions
noted every 7 to 10 minutes.
➤

Next step in management: Continue to observe the labor.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the normal labor parameters in the latent and active phase for nulliparous and multiparous patients.
2. Be familiar with the management of common labor abnormalities and
know that normal labor does not require intervention.
3. Know that rubella vaccination, as a live-attenuated preparation, should
not be administered during pregnancy.

Considerations
This 26-year-old G1 P0 woman is at term (defined as between 37 to 42
completed weeks from the last menstrual period). She is in the active phase
of labor (generally about 4 cm of dilation) and her cervix has changed from
4 cm to 7 cm over 2 hours; her contractions are only every 7 to 10 minutes.
Because she is nulliparous, the expectation is that her cervix will dilate at
a rate of at least 1.2 cm/h during the active phase of labor. She has met
these norms by a change of 1.5 cm/h (3 cm over 2 hours). The uterine contraction pattern appears suboptimal, but it is the change in the cervix per
time and not the uterine contraction pattern that dictates normalcy in
labor. Because she has had a normal labor, the appropriate management is
to observe her course without intervention. The clinical pelvimetry is
accomplished by digital palpation of the pelvic bones. This patient’s pelvis
was judged to be adequate. Unfortunately, this estimation is not very precise, and in clinical practice, the clinician would generally observe the
labor of a nulliparous patient. Finally, the nonimmune rubella status should
alert the practitioner to immunize for rubella during the postpartum time
(since the rubella vaccine is live-attenuated and is contraindicated during
pregnancy).

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Labor Evaluation
DEFINITIONS
LABOR: Cervical change accompanied by regular uterine contractions.
LATENT PHASE: The initial part of labor where the cervix mainly effaces

(thins) rather than dilates (usually cervical dilation >4 cm).
ACTIVE PHASE: The portion of labor where dilation occurs more rapidly,

usually when the cervix is greater than 4-cm dilation.
PROTRACTION OF ACTIVE PHASE: Cervical dilation in the active phase
that is less than expected (normal ≥1.2 cm/h for a nulliparous woman, and
≥ 1.5 cm/h for a woman who has had at least one vaginal delivery).
ARREST OF ACTIVE PHASE: No progress in the active phase of labor for
2 hours.
STAGES OF LABOR: First stage: onset of labor to complete dilation of cervix.
Second stage: complete cervical dilation to delivery of infant. Third stage:
delivery of infant to delivery of placenta.
FETAL HEART RATE BASELINE: Normally between 110 and 160 bpm. Fetal
bradycardia is a baseline less than 110 bpm, and fetal tachycardia is exceeding 160 bpm.
DECELERATIONS: Fetal heart rate episodic changes below the baseline.
There are three types of decelerations: early (mirror image of uterine contractions), variable (abrupt jagged dips below the baseline), and late which are
offset following the uterine contraction.
ACCELERATIONS: Episodes of the fetal heart rate that increase above the
baseline for at least 15 bpm and last for at least 15 second.

CLINICAL APPROACH TO LABOR
The assessment of labor is based on cervical change versus time (Table 6–1).
Normal labor should be expectantly managed. When a labor abnormality is
diagnosed, then the three Ps should be evaluated (powers, passenger, and
pelvis). When inadequate “powers” are thought to be the etiology, then oxytocin may be initiated to augment the uterine contraction strength and/or
frequency. When the latent phase exceeds the upper limits of normal, then
it is called a prolonged latent phase. When the cervix has exceeded 4 to
5 cm, particularly with near-complete effacement, then the active phase has
been reached. When there is cervical dilation but less than the minimum
expected change, then this is called protraction of active phase. When the

cervix does not dilate for 2 hours in the active phase, then it is called arrest
of active phase.
When there is cephalopelvic disproportion, where the pelvis is too small for
the fetus (either due to an abnormal pelvis or an excessively large baby), then
cesarean delivery must be considered. When the “powers” are thought to be
the factor, then intravenous oxytocin may be initiated via a dilute titration.
Clinically adequate uterine contractions are defined as contractions every 2 to
3 minutes, firm on palpation, and lasting for at least 40 to 60 seconds (Figure 6–1).
Some clinicians choose to use internal uterine catheters to evaluate the adequacy of the powers. One common assessment tool is to examine a 10-minute
window and add each contraction’s rise above baseline (each mm Hg rise is
called a Montevideo unit). A calculation that meets or exceeds 200 Montevideo
units is commonly accepted as an adequate uterine contraction pattern
(Figure 6–2).
Fetal heart rate assessment can help to assess the fetal status. A normal
baseline between 110 and 160 bpm, with accelerations, and variability are
indicative of a normal well-oxygenated fetus. Fetal tachycardia can occur
due to a variety of disorders such as maternal fever. Fetal bradycardia, if
profound and prolonged, necessitates intervention. The most common
decelerations are variable, caused by cord compression. If these are intermittent with abrupt return to baseline, then they can be observed. Early
decelerations, caused by fetal head compression, are benign. Late decelerations are “offset” from the uterine contraction with their onset after the
onset of the contraction, the nadir following the contraction peak, and the
return to baseline following the contraction resolution. Late decelerations
suggest fetal hypoxia, and if persistent, can indicate fetal acidemia. (See
Figure 6-3).

ANSWERS
6.1

C. This patient is still in the (normal) latent phase; the upper limit
is 14 hours. A fetal scalp pH monitor is a method for obtaining a
small amount of capillary blood from the fetal scalp to assess for fetal
academia, procedure that is very infrequently performed. It is not
indicated in this scenario and does not aid in the progress of labor.
Intravenous oxytocin enhances contraction strength and/or frequency, but does not affect cervical dilation. A cesarean delivery is
considered if there is a disorder during the active phase of labor and
not the latent phase. Intranasal gonadotropin therapy is not indicated during any phase of labor.

6.2

C. A 3-hour second stage of labor still is abnormal, even with epidural
analgesia. An anthropoid pelvis, which predisposes to the persistent
fetal occiput posterior position, is characterized by a pelvis with an
anteroposterior diameter greater than the transverse diameter with
prominent ischial spines and a narrow anterior segment. The baby is
at “0” station, meaning the presenting part (in most cases, the bony
part of the fetal head) is right at the plane of the ischial spines and
not at the pelvic inlet. Station refers to the relationship of the presenting bony part of the fetal head in relation to the ischial spines,
and not the pelvic inlet. Engagement refers to the relationship of the
widest diameter of the presenting part and its location with reference
to the pelvic inlet.

6.3

D. Protracted active phase means some progress but less than
expected (1.5 cm/h) in the active phase of labor. This patient is
>4 cm dilated, so she is in active phase and not latent phase of
labor. This would have been an arrest of active phase if there had
been no progress at all. The cervix has changed 1 cm over 2 hours
when the expected change would be 3 cm, therefore this is not normal labor.

6.4

C. Bloody show or loss of cervical mucus plug often is a sign of
impending labor. The sticky mucus admixed with blood can differentiate bloody show from antepartum bleeding. Placenta previa, placenta abruption, and vasa previa are all associated with antepartum
bleeding. A cervical laceration typically occurs during a vaginal
delivery. They may be associated with postpartum hemorrhage.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The normalcy of labor is determined by assessing the cervical change versus time. Normal labor should be observed.
➤ Cesarean delivery (for labor abnormalities) in the absence of clear
cephalopelvic disproportion is generally reserved for arrest of active phase
with adequate uterine contractions.
➤ Adequate uterine contractions is not a precise definition, but is commonly
judged as greater than 200 Montevideo units with an internal uterine pressure catheter, or by uterine contractions every 2 to 3 minutes, firm on palpation, and lasting at least 40 to 60 seconds.
➤ In general, latent labor occurs when the cervix is less than 4-cm dilated and
active labor when the cervix is greater than 4-cm dilated.
➤ Early decelerations are mirror images of uterine contractions, caused by
fetal head compressions.
➤ Variable decelerations are abrupt in decline and abrupt in resolution and
are caused by cord compression.
➤ Late decelerations are gradual in shape and are offset from the uterine
contractions, caused by uteroplacental insufficiency (hypoxia).
➤ The normal fetal heart rate baseline is between 110 and 160 bpm.

ANSWER TO CASE 7:
Threatened Abortion
Summary: An 18-year-old adolescent female at 7 weeks’ gestation by LMP
complains of a 2-day history of vaginal spotting and lower abdomen pain. The
physical examination reveals a 4-week-sized uterus and unremarkable
adnexa. The β-hCG level is 700 mIU/mL and no intrauterine gestational sac
is noted on endovaginal sonography.
➤

Next step in management: Follow up β-hCG in 48 hours.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the concept of the hCG discriminatory zone or threshold, and
its utility with transvaginal sonography.
2. Understand the principle of obtaining a follow-up hCG level when a
patient is asymptomatic and has an hCG level that is below the discriminatory zone.
3. Know that a normal ultrasound examination does not rule out the presence
of an ectopic pregnancy.

Considerations
This 18-year-old patient complains of lower abdominal pain and vaginal spotting, which in a woman of childbearing potential should be considered an
ectopic pregnancy until otherwise proven. She does not have a history of sexually transmitted diseases, which if present would be a risk factor for an
ectopic pregnancy. The physical examination is unremarkable and ultrasound
does not show any adnexal masses. Significantly, the hCG level is below the
threshold whereby transvaginal sonography should reveal an intrauterine
pregnancy (hCG threshold of 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL). Thus, the goal is to
establish whether this pregnancy is a normal intrauterine gestation or an
abnormal pregnancy. This may be accomplished by following serial hCG levels.
After 48 hours, if the follow-up hCG level rises by at least 66%, then the
patient most likely has a normal intrauterine pregnancy. If the follow-up hCG
does not rise by 66% (particularly if it rises by only 20%), then she most likely
has an abnormal pregnancy. The subnormal rise in hCG does not indicate
whether the abnormal pregnancy is in the uterus or the tube. Notably, the gestational age based on last menstrual period is not very reliable. Thus, the hCG
levels and transvaginal ultrasound are generally the best tools for evaluating a
possible ectopic pregnancy.

CLINICAL CASES

73

APPROACH TO
Threatened Abortion
DEFINITIONS
THREATENED ABORTION: Pregnancy with vaginal spotting during the first

half of pregnancy. This does not delineate the viability of the pregnancy.
ECTOPIC PREGNANCY: Pregnancy outside of the normal uterine implantation site. Most of the time, this means a pregnancy in the fallopian tube.
HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN: “The pregnancy hormone,” which
is a glycoprotein that is secreted by the chorionic villi of a pregnancy. It is the
hormone on which pregnancy tests are based. The normal pregnancy will have
a logarithmic rise in early pregnancy. Usually the β-subunit is assayed to prevent
cross-reactivity with LH.
HCG THRESHOLD: Level of serum hCG such that an intrauterine pregnancy
should be seen on ultrasound. For endovaginal sonography, this level is 1500
to 2000 mIU/mL. When an intrauterine pregnancy is not seen on sonography
and the hCG level exceeds the threshold, then it is highly probable that an
ectopic pregnancy is present.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The possibility of ectopic pregnancy must be considered when assessing a
pregnant woman with vaginal spotting and/or lower abdominal pain. It is of
paramount importance to determine if the woman is hypotensive, volume
depleted, or has severe abdominal or adnexal pain. These patients will most
likely need laparoscopy or laparotomy since ectopic pregnancy is probable.
For asymptomatic women, the quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) level is useful. When the hCG level is below the threshold for sonographic visualization of an intrauterine gestational sac, then a repeat hCG
level is generally performed in 48 hours to establish the viability of pregnancy.
Another option would be a single progesterone level: levels greater than
25 ng/mL almost always indicate a normal intrauterine gestation, whereas
values less than 5 ng/mL usually correlate with a nonviable gestation. When
a nonviable pregnancy is diagnosed either by an abnormal hCG rise or single
progesterone assay (< 5 ng/mL), it is still unclear whether the patient has a
spontaneous abortion or an ectopic pregnancy. Many clinicians will perform
a uterine curettage at this time to assess whether the patient has a miscarriage
(histologic confirmation of chorionic villi) or an ectopic pregnancy (no villi
from the curettage). Women with asymptomatic, small (< 3.5 cm) ectopic
pregnancies are ideal candidates for intramuscular methotrexate. A nonviable
intrauterine pregnancy may be managed expectantly, surgically via dilation

74

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

and curettage, or medically with vaginal misoprostol. Vaginal misoprostol has
been reported to be effective in evacuating the pregnancy in about 80% of cases.
When the hCG level is greater than the ultrasound threshold, then a transvaginal sonogram will dictate the next step. A patient in whom an intrauterine gestational sac is seen may be sent home with a diagnosis of threatened
abortion and should have close follow-up. There is still a significant risk of miscarriage. When the hCG level is above the threshold, and there is no sonographic evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is
high (about 85%), and thus laparoscopy is often undertaken to diagnose and
treat the ectopic pregnancy. Because an intrauterine gestation is possible in
this circumstance (about 15% of the time), methotrexate is usually not given;
however, a high hCG level in the face of a sonographically empty uterus is
almost always caused by an extrauterine gestation. (See Figure 7–1 for one

A 22-year-old woman, who is pregnant at 5 weeks’ gestation, complains of severe lower abdominal pain. On examination, she is noted
to have a blood pressure of 86/44 mm Hg and heart rate of 120 bpm.
Her abdomen is tender. The pelvic examination is difficult to perform
due to guarding. The hCG level is 500 mIU/mL and the transvaginal
sonogram reveals no intrauterine gestational sac and no adnexal masses.
There is some free fluid in the cul-de-sac. Which of the following is the
best management for this patient?
A. Repeat hCG level in 48 hours to assess for a rise of 66%.
B. Check the serum progesterone level.
C. Immediate surgery.
D. Intramuscular methotrexate.
E. Repeat sonography in 48 hours.

ANSWERS
7.1

A. Chlamydial infection increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The
use of combination oral contraceptives tends to prevent all pregnancies, both ectopic and intrauterine, and is not a risk factor. A history
of a tubal ligation by itself does not increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. However, if a woman has had a tubal ligation and then becomes
pregnant, there is a significant risk of tubal pregnancy. Prior ectopic
pregnancy greatly increases the risk of future ectopic pregnancy.

7.2

C. Many women treated with methotrexate will have mild abdominal pain, which may be observed in the absence of severe peritoneal
signs of hypotension, or overt signs of rupture. However, if these
signs are present, a laparotomy would be indicated. Pain associated
with resolution of tubal pregnancy is usually distinguishable from
tubal rupture. The pain of resolution is typically much milder than
the pain of tubal rupture and is not associated with acute abdomen
or hemodynamic instability. An epidural is not indicated for this
type of pain or scenario. Repeating the dose of methotrexate will not
alleviate the patient’s pain, and may just worsen the painful side
effects of the drug. A folic acid rescue is sometimes used in cancer
patients experiencing toxic side effects of methotrexate such as
inflammation of the digestive tract.

7.3

D. There is insufficient information in this scenario to establish viability of the pregnancy. A repeat hCG in 48 hours may be able to
assess the state of the pregnancy. Since no conclusion may be drawn,
it would be difficult to say whether this patient has an unruptured
ectopic pregnancy, an intrauterine pregnancy that is too early to
assess by ultrasound, or a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy. An MRI

CLINICAL CASES

77

is not specific in evaluating for an ectopic versus viable intrauterine
pregnancy, plus it is costly and time consuming.
7.4

C. Surgery is indicated because this patient is hypotensive and
tachycardic due to a likely ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This patient
is in shock, and immediate surgery is indicated to prevent end organ
damage that may immediately lead to or eventually result in death.
Delaying treatment or relying on intramuscular (IM) methotrexate is
not indicated for a patient in hemodynamic instability. Considering
the patient’s symptoms, methotrexate would be an ineffective treatment anyway since the ectopic pregnancy has most likely ruptured.
A progesterone level would not be of use because tubal rupture in
itself would indicate a nonviable gestation was present.

Clinical Pearls
➤ When the hCG level is above the threshold and no intrauterine pregnancy
is seen on transvaginal ultrasound, the patient most likely has an ectopic
pregnancy.
➤ Early in the course of a normal intrauterine pregnancy, the β-hCG should
rise by at least 66% over 48 hours.
➤ The presence of a true intrauterine gestational sac on ultrasound makes
the risk of ectopic pregnancy very unlikely.
➤ Surgery is usually the best therapy in a patient with an early pregnancy
who is hypotensive or has severe adnexal pain.

ANSWERS TO CASE 8:
Placenta Accreta
Summary: A 35-year-old G5 P4 woman at term with a prior history of a
myomectomy and cesarean delivery is undergoing a vaginal delivery. The
retained placenta is firmly adherent to the uterus when there is an attempt at
manual extraction.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Placenta accreta.

➤

Next step in management for this patient: Hysterectomy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the risk factors for and the clinical diagnosis of placenta accreta.
2. Understand that hysterectomy is usually the best treatment for placenta accreta.

Considerations
This patient has had two previous uterine incisions, which increases the risk of placenta accreta. The placenta is noted to be very adherent to the uterus, which is the
clinical definition of placenta accreta, although the histologic diagnosis requires a
defect of the decidua basalis layer. The usual management of true placental accreta
is hysterectomy since attempts to remove a firmly attached placenta often lead to
hemorrhage and/or maternal death. Conservative management of placenta accreta, such as removal of as much placenta as possible and packing the uterus, often
leads to excess mortality as compared to immediate hysterectomy. Nevertheless in
a younger patient who strongly desires more children, this option may rarely be
entertained.

APPROACH TO
Placenta Accreta
DEFINITIONS
PLACENTA ACCRETA: Abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine
wall due to an abnormality of the decidua basalis layer of the uterus. The placental villi are attached to the myometrium.

CLINICAL CASES

81

PLACENTA INCRETA: The abnormally implanted placenta penetrates into

the myometrium.
PLACENTA PERCRETA: The abnormally implanted placenta penetrates

entirely through the myometrium to the serosa. Often invasion into the bladder is noted.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Risk factors for placental adherence include low-lying placentation or placenta previa, prior cesarean delivery or uterine curettage, or prior myomectomy. Antepartum bleeding may occur. With complete placenta accreta,
there may be no bleeding and only a retained placenta. Undue traction on
the cord may lead to uterine inversion. With a retained placenta, clinicians
will usually attempt a manual extraction of the placenta, in an effort to find
a cleavage plane between the placenta and the uterus. With placenta accreta, no cleavage plane is found. Hysterectomy is usually the best choice in
this circumstance. Because the placenta is so firmly adherent, attempts to
conserve the uterus, such as curettage of the placenta or removing the placenta “piecemeal,” are often unsuccessful, and may lead to hemorrhage and
exsanguination.
Placenta accreta should be suspected in circumstances of placenta previa,
particularly with a history of a prior cesarean delivery (Table 8–1). The
greater the number of prior cesareans in the face of current placenta previa,
the higher the risk of accreta. For example, a woman with three or more prior
cesarean deliveries and a low-lying anterior placenta suggestive of partial previa or a known placenta previa has up to a 40% to 50% chance of having placenta accreta. Some practitioners advise performing ultrasound examinations
to assess the placental location in those women who have had a prior cesarean
delivery. Studies examining the accuracy of MRI to diagnose placenta accreta
prior to delivery reveal a sensitivity of only 38%. When the placenta is anterior or low-lying in position, there is a greater risk of accreta. One caution is
that a low-lying placenta or placenta previa diagnosed in the second trimester
may resolve in the third trimester as the lower uterine segment grows more
rapidly, a phenomenon known as “transmigration of the placenta.”

83

A 32-year-old woman undergoes myomectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids, all of which are subserosal. The endometrial cavity was
not entered during the procedure. Which of the following statements
is most likely to be correct regarding the risk of placental accreta?
A. Her risk of accreta is most likely to be increased due to the
myomectomy.
B. Her risk of accreta is most likely to be decreased due to the
myomectomy.
C. Her risk of accreta is most likely not affected by the myomectomy.
D. If the myomectomy incisions are anterior, then she has an increased
risk of a placental polyp.

ANSWERS
8.1

D. Placenta accreta is more common with increasing number of
cesareans and placenta previa. Three prior cesareans with placenta
previa are associated with up to a 50% risk for placenta accreta, in
which the decidua basalis layer is defective. It is the endometrial
layer that is defective and not the myometrial layer. Nevertheless,
the placenta may grow into the myometrium or even through the
entire uterus to the serosa.

8.2

C. The blue tissue densely adherent between the uterus and bladder
is very characteristic of percreta, where the placenta penetrates
entirely through the myometrium to the serosa and adheres to the
bladder. These findings are not typically found with placenta accreta
or polyps. Malignant melanoma can metastasize to the placenta, but
this is much less common under these circumstances.

8.3

A. The best management of placenta accreta is hysterectomy due
to the great risk of hemorrhage if the placenta is attempted to be
removed. When the patient refuses hysterectomy, then ligation of
the umbilical cord as high as possible and attempt at IV methotrexate therapy has been attempted with limited success. Other than
hemorrhage, the other complication to be concerned about is
infection. The necrosis of the placental tissue can be a nidus for
infection.

8.4

C. In general, myomectomy incisions on the serosal (outside) surface
of the uterus do not predispose to accreta because the endometrium
is not disturbed. However, the risk of accreta is not decreased due to
the myomectomy either. Placental polyps result from retained products after either a term pregnancy or incomplete abortion, and occur
inside the uterus. Therefore, the location of the incisions for a
myomectomy will not influence whether or not a patient develops
polyps.

84

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Clinical Pearls
➤ The usual management of placenta accreta (abnormal adherence of the
placenta to the uterus) is hysterectomy.
➤ Placenta accreta is associated with a defect in the decidua basalis.
➤ The risk of placenta accreta increases in a woman with a prior uterine
incision and placenta previa. The greater the number of cesareans, the
higher the risk of accreta.
➤ Low-lying or marginal placenta previa diagnosed in the second trimester
will often resolve later in pregnancy, so repeat sonography is prudent.

vaginal bleeding is a pregnancy-related disorder, such as ectopic pregnancy or
threatened abortion. In this case, the patient’s pregnancy test is negative. The
purulent vaginal discharge is found to be diagnostic of gonorrhea by Gram
stain. Because of gonorrhea’s propensity to invade the endocervix, this woman
almost certainly has at least cervicitis. Thus, the endocervix should be sampled
for culture or DNA probe. The next step is to assess the extent of the disease.
This patient had no evidence of salpingitis (tubal infection) since she did not
have adnexal tenderness. She did not complain of abdominal tenderness or
heavy menses (uterine involvement), which would be more indicative of upper
genital tract disease. Likewise, she has no joint complaints to indicate gonococcal arthritis, or painful skin lesions to suggest disseminated gonorrhea.
One common treatment for gonococcal cervicitis is ceftriaxone 125 to 250 mg
intramuscularly. Because Chlamydia often coexists with gonorrhea, therapy
with azithromycin 1 g orally or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 to 10 days
is also indicated. The gonococcal organisms appear to be confined to the

endocervix in this case, but complications can include ascension to the tubes
causing infertility (tubal disease) or a development of ectopic pregnancy in
the future.

APPROACH TO
Gonococcal Cervicitis
DEFINITIONS
MUCOPURULENT CERVICITIS: Yellow exudative discharge arising from
the endocervix with 10 or more polymorphonucleocytes per high-power field
on microscopy.
LOWER GENITAL TRACT: The vulva, vagina, and cervix.
UPPER GENITAL TRACT: The uterine corpus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

CLINICAL APPROACH
An infection of the cervix is analogous to an infection of the urethra in the
male. Thus, sexually transmitted pathogens, such as Chlamydia trachomatis,
N gonorrhoeae, or herpes simplex virus, may infect the cervix. Gonococcal and
chlamydial organisms have a propensity for the columnar cells of the endocervix. Often, erythema of the endocervix is noted, leading to friability; these
patients may complain of postcoital spotting. Mucopurulent cervical discharge
is a common complaint, again analogous to the exudative urethral discharge of
the male. The most common organism implicated in mucopurulent cervical
discharge is C trachomatis, although gonorrhea may also be a pathogen.
When a patient presents with this type of cervical discharge, Gram stain
may be done; if evidence of gonorrhea is present, that is, intracellular gramnegative diplococci, then treatment should be directed toward gonococcal
disease (ceftriaxone 125 to 250 mg IM). Because of the frequency of coexisting chlamydial infection, azithromycin 1 g orally or doxycycline 100 mg orally
bid for 7 to 10 days is also often given. If the Gram stain of the cervical discharge is negative, then antimicrobial therapy directed at Chlamydia is warranted. Nevertheless, cultures or tests for both organisms should be performed.
If the symptoms resolve, no follow-up cultures need to be done (see Figure 9–1
for one suggested management scheme). Finally, the patient and partner
should be counseled and offered testing for other sexually transmitted organisms such as HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C.
Gonococcal cervicitis may lead to more serious complications. The organism
may ascend and infect the fallopian tubes, causing salpingitis. The term pelvic
inflammatory disease is usually synonymous with acute salpingitis. The tubal
infection in turn predisposes the patient to infertility and ectopic pregnancies

to an infectious arthritis, usually involving the large joints, and classically is
migratory. In fact, in the United States, gonorrhea is the most common cause
of septic arthritis in young women. Disseminated gonorrhea can occur also;
affected individuals will usually have eruptions of painful pustules with an erythematous base on the skin. The diagnosis is made by Gram stain and culture
of the pustules.

C. Group B Streptococcus
D. Treponema pallidum

90

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
9.1

B. Chlamydial cervicitis is the most common cause of mucopurulent
cervical discharge. Although gonorrhea is also associated with a
mucopurulent discharge, it is less common than Chlamydia. The
mucus in the mucopurulent discharge is due to involvement of the
columnar (mucin-containing) glandular cells of the endocervix.

9.2

B. This patient has salpingitis; common organisms include Gonorrhea,
Chlamydia, gram-negative rods, and anaerobes. Risk factors for salpingitis include: use of an IUD, previous infection with either Gonorrhea
or Chlamydia, surgery, or anything that breaks the cervical barrier and
enhances transfer of organisms from the endocervix to the upper
reproductive tract. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative nonfermenting bacillus that is commonly known to cause infections associated with hot tubs, contaminated contact lens solution, patients on
ventilators (typically in the ICU), and immunocompromised patients
(ie, burn patients). It is not associated with infecting the upper genital
tract. Treponema pallidum is a spirochete bacterium that causes syphilis.
There are multiple stages that this chronic disease may progress to if left
untreated. The presenting symptom in the first stage of disease is a painless chancre typically located at the site of inoculation and not lower
abdominal tenderness with dyspareunia. Treatment of choice is penicillin. Actinomyces is an organism considered part of the normal vaginal
flora and is associated with intrauterine device use, but is not commonly encountered.

9.3

C. Neither gonorrhea nor chlamydial infection typically cause vaginitis.
This patient likely has bacterial vaginosis, based on the fishy odor.
Candida infection does not usually cause a fishy odor, and induces a
heterogenous (cottage-cheese) discharge.

9.4

A. The diagnosis of gonococcal pharyngitis is made by swabbing the
throat. The infection is typically located on the tonsils and back of the
throat. Patients who engage in oral sex are at increased risk of acquiring
gonococcal pharyngitis. Typically no symptoms are noted by the patient
unless the disease disseminates. Chlamydia is not a common cause of
pharyngitis most likely because, unlike Neisseria gonorrhea, it lacks the
pili that allow the gonococcal bacteria to adhere to the surface of the
columnar epithelium at the back of the throat.

9.5

A. Disseminated gonococcal disease leads to multiple, often painful,
pustules on the skin. These pustules can be cultured and Gram stained
for diagnostic purposes. Other signs of disseminated gonococcal disease
include fever, malaise, chills, and joint pain or swelling. Chlamydia is
not a common cause of a disseminated process; however, reinfection or
persistent infections are common.

CLINICAL CASES

9.6

91

B. Both chlamydial infection and gonorrhea may cause conjunctivitis and blindness in a newborn. Gonococcal infections usually present
between the second and fifth days of life, whereas chlamydial infections present between the fifth and fourteenth day of life. Neisseria
gonorrhea was once the most common cause of blindness in the newborn. Chlamydia trachomatis may also cause infantile pneumonia, generally between 1 and 3 months of age.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The two most common etiologies of mucopurulent cervical discharge are
chlamydial infection and gonorrhea (of which chlamydial infection is more
common).
➤ Gram-negative intracellular diplococci are highly suggestive of
N gonorrhoeae.
➤ Chlamydia often coexists with gonococcal cervicitis.
➤ Ceftriaxone treats gonorrhea, whereas doxycycline or azithromycin treat
chlamydial infections.

A 35-year-old woman at 8 weeks’ gestation complains of crampy lower
abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She states that the pain was
intense last night, and that something that looked like liver passed per
vagina. After that, the pain subsided tremendously as did the vaginal
bleeding. On examination, her blood pressure (BP) is 130/80 mm Hg,
heart rate (HR) 90 beats per minute, and temperature is 98°F (36.6°C).
Her abdominal examination is unremarkable. The pelvic examination

ANSWERS TO CASE 10:
Completed Spontaneous Abortion
Summary: A 35-year-old woman at 8 weeks’ gestational age had intense crampy
lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding last night; after passing what looked
like “liver,” her pain and bleeding subsided tremendously. On examination, her
cervix is closed.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Completed abortion.

➤

Next step in management: Follow hCG levels to zero.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the typical characteristics of the different types of spontaneous
abortions.
2. Understand the clinical presentations of and the treatments for the different types of abortions.

Considerations
This woman is pregnant at 8 weeks’ gestation, which is in the first trimester.
She noted intense cramping pain the night before and passed something that
looked like liver to her. This may be tissue, although the gross appearance of
presumed tissue can be misleading. The patient’s pain and bleeding have subsided since the passage of the “liver.” This fits with the complete expulsion of
the pregnancy tissue. The clinical picture of passage of tissue, resolution of
cramping and bleeding, and a closed cervical os are consistent with a completed abortion. To confirm that all of the pregnancy (trophoblastic) tissue
has been expelled from the uterus, the clinician should follow serum quantitative hCG levels. It is expected that the hCG levels should halve every 48
to 72 hours. If the hCG levels plateau instead of falling, then the patient has
residual pregnancy tissue (which may be either an incomplete abortion or an
ectopic pregnancy). Notably, this patient is of advanced maternal age, and
spontaneous abortions are more common in older patients. The most common
cause identified with spontaneous abortion is a chromosomal abnormality of
the embryo.

95

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Spontaneous Abortion
DEFINITIONS
THREATENED ABORTION: A pregnancy less than 20 weeks’ gestation asso-

ciated with vaginal bleeding, generally without cervical dilation.
INEVITABLE ABORTION: A pregnancy less than 20 weeks’ gestation asso-

ciated with cramping, bleeding, and cervical dilation; there is no passage of
tissue.
INCOMPLETE ABORTION: A pregnancy less than 20 weeks’ gestation associated with cramping, vaginal bleeding, an open cervical os, and some passage
of tissue per vagina, but also some retained tissue in utero. The cervix remains
open due to the continued uterine contractions; the uterus continues to contract in an effort to expel the retained tissue.
COMPLETED ABORTION: A pregnancy less than 20 weeks’ gestation in
which all the products of conception have passed; the cervix is generally
closed. Because all the tissue has passed, the uterus no longer contracts, and
the cervix closes.
MISSED ABORTION: A pregnancy less than 20 weeks’ gestation with embryonic or fetal demise but no symptoms such as bleeding or cramping.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The history, physical examination, and/or sonography usually point to the
category of spontaneous abortion (Table 10–1). Women with threatened
abortion should be instructed to bring in any passed tissue for histologic
analysis.
Note: An inevitable abortion must be differentiated from an incompetent
cervix. With an inevitable abortion, the uterine contractions (cramping) lead
to the cervical dilation. With an incompetent cervix, the cervix opens spontaneously without uterine contractions and, therefore, affected women present with painless cervical dilation. This disorder is treated with a surgical
ligature at the level of the internal cervical os (cerclage). Hence, one of the
main features used to distinguish between an incompetent cervix and an
inevitable abortion is the presence or absence of uterine contractions.
The treatment of an incomplete abortion, characterized by the passage of
tissue and an open cervical os, is dilatation and curettage of the uterus. The
primary complications of persistently retained tissue are bleeding and infection.
A completed abortion is suspected by the history of having passed tissue and
experiencing cramping abdominal pain, now resolved. The cervix is closed.

Serum hCG levels are still followed to confirm that no further chorionic villi
are contained in the uterus.
An unusual type of abnormal pregnancy is a molar pregnancy, which is
trophoblastic tissue, or placenta-like tissue, usually without a fetus. The clinical presentation of molar pregnancy is vaginal spotting, absence of fetal heart
tones, size greater than dates, and markedly elevated HCG levels. The diagnosis is by ultrasound, revealing a “snow storm” like pattern in the uterus.
Uterine suction curettage is the treatment. After curettage, patients are followed with weekly hCG levels because sometimes gestational trophoblastic
disease persists after evacuation of the molar pregnancy. In these instances,
chemotherapy is used.

Comprehension Questions
Match the single best treatment (A-F) with the clinical scenario (10.1-10.4).
A. Laparoscopy

10.1

A 19-year-old G1 P0 woman at 18 weeks’ gestation, who had a prior
cervical conization procedure, states that she had felt no abdominal
cramping. She has a cervical dilation of 2 cm and effacement of 70%.

10.2

A 33-year-old woman at 10 weeks’ gestation complains of vaginal bleeding and passage of a whitish substance along with something “meatlike.” She continues to have cramping, and her cervix is 2 cm dilated.

10.3

A 20-year-old G2 P1 woman at 12 weeks’ gestation has had no problems with this pregnancy prior to today. She complains of some slight
vaginal spotting. No fetal heart tones are heard on Doppler, and a
transvaginal ultrasound reveals no uterine gestational sac and no
adnexal masses. The hCG level is 700 mIU/mL.

A 28-year-old G3 P2 woman at 22 weeks’ gestation is noted to have
vaginal spotting, and fetal heart tones are in the 140 to 145 bpm range.

98

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
10.1

C. The hallmark of cervical incompetence is painless dilation of the
cervix. Cervical conization is a risk factor for incompetent cervix.
Other risk factors for incompetent cervix include: congenital manifestations (ie, short cervix or collagen disorder), trauma to the
cervix, prolonged second stage of labor, and uterine overdistention as
with a multiple gestation pregnancy. No contractions were felt by the
patient in this scenario, so the diagnosis is less likely to be inevitable
abortion. Cervical incompetence may be treated with a surgical ligature known as a cerclage.

10.2

D. An open cervical os, a history of passing tissue, and continued
cramping are all findings consistent with an incomplete abortion.
If the cramping had stopped and the cervix closed, this would have
been a complete abortion. The treatment of an incomplete abortion
is dilation and curettage (D&C) of the uterus to prevent complications of retained tissue such as hemorrhage and infection. The products of conception obtained from the curettage are sent for pathology
to confirm the diagnosis and to look for rare complications such as
molar pregnancy.

10.3

B. This patient has a threatened abortion. Her hCG level is below
the threshold when a gestational sac should be seen on transvaginal
sonography (1500-2000 mIU/mL). Thus, it is unclear with the information at this time to discern whether she has a normal early intrauterine pregnancy, or an abnormal pregnancy (miscarriage or ectopic).
Follow-up hCG level in 48 hours would be judicious; an appropriate
rise in hCG of at least 66% is consistent with a normal intrauterine
pregnancy, whereas a rise less than 66% is highly suggestive of an
abnormal pregnancy.

10.4

E. This patient does not have an abortive process since she is at 22 weeks’
gestation; she has antepartum bleeding. Abortions are described as less
than 20 weeks’ gestation. The two most common causes of antepartum
bleeding are placenta previa and placental abruption. In abruption,
the patient typically presents to triage with severe abdominal pain.
The evaluation of this patient would include ultrasound to assess for
placenta previa, and if this is ruled out, then speculum examination
and assessment for abruption.

CLINICAL CASES

99

Clinical Pearls
➤ When a pregnant woman has an open cervical os with uterine cramping
and history of passage of tissue, she usually has an incomplete abortion,
best treated by uterine curettage.
➤ The typical history of a completed abortion is resolution of cramping and
vaginal bleeding following passage of tissue, and the finding of a small
firm uterus and a closed cervical os.
➤ The most common cause of a first-trimester miscarriage is a fetal karyotypic abnormality.
➤ Incompetent cervix, which is suspected with painless cervical dilation, is
best treated with a cervical cerclage (stitch).
➤ A molar pregnancy is an unusual type of pregnancy characterized by vaginal spotting, absence of fetal heart tones, and size greater than dates. The
diagnosis is made by sonography.

Shoulder Dystocia
Summary: A 25-year-old obese G2 P1 woman is delivering at 42 weeks’ gestation; the fetus appears clinically to be 3700 g (average weight). After a 4-hour
first stage of labor, and a 2-hour second stage of labor, the head delivers but
the shoulders do not easily deliver.
➤

Next step in management: McRoberts maneuver (hyperflexion of the
maternal hips onto the maternal abdomen and/or suprapubic pressure).

➤

Likely complication: A likely maternal complication is postpartum hemorrhage; a common neonatal complication is a brachial plexus injury such as
an Erb palsy.

➤

Maternal condition: Gestational diabetes, which increases the fetal weight
on the shoulders and abdomen.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the risk factors for shoulder dystocia.
2. Understand that shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency, and be familiar with the initial maneuvers used to manage this condition.
3. Know the neonatal complications that can occur with shoulder dystocia.

Considerations
The patient is multiparous and obese, both of which are risk factors for shoulder dystocia. There is no indication of gestational diabetes, which would also
be a significant risk factor. The patient is post-term at 42 weeks, which increases
the likelihood of fetal macrosomia. The patient’s prolonged second stage of
labor (upper limits for a multiparous patient is 1 hour without and 2 hours with
epidural analgesia) may be a nonspecific indicator of impending shoulder dystocia. Nevertheless, the diagnosis is straightforward in that the fetal shoulders
are described as not easily delivering. The fetal head is retracted back toward
the maternal introitus, the “turtle sign.” Because most shoulder dystocia
events are unpredictable, as in this case, the clinician must be proficient in
the management of this entity, particularly because of the potential for fetal
injury.

CLINICAL CASES

103

APPROACH TO
Shoulder Dystocia
DEFINITIONS
SHOULDER DYSTOCIA: Inability of the fetal shoulders to deliver sponta-

neously, usually due to the impaction of the anterior shoulder behind the
maternal symphysis pubis.
MCROBERTS MANEUVER: The maternal thighs are sharply flexed against the
maternal abdomen to straighten the sacrum relative to the lumbar spine and
rotate the symphysis pubis anteriorly toward the maternal head (Figure 11–1).
SUPRAPUBIC PRESSURE: The operator’s hand is used to push on the suprapubic region in a downward or lateral direction in an effort to push the fetal
shoulder into an oblique plane and from behind the symphysis pubis.
ERB PALSY: A brachial plexus injury involving the C5-C6 nerve roots, which
may result from the downward traction of the anterior shoulder; the baby usually has weakness of the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles as well as the flexor
muscles of the forearm. The arm often hangs limply by the side and is internally rotated.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Because of the unpredictability and urgency of shoulder dystocia, the clinician
should rehearse its management and be ready when the situation is encountered. Shoulder dystocia should be suspected with fetal macrosomia, maternal
obesity, prolonged second stage of labor, and gestational diabetes. However, it
must be noted that almost one-half of all cases occur in babies weighing less
than 4000 g, and shoulder dystocia is frequently unsuspected. Significant fetal
hypoxia may occur with undue delay from the delivery of the head to the body.
Moreover, excessive traction on the fetal head may lead to a brachial plexus
injury to the baby. It should be recognized that brachial plexus injury can occur
with vaginal delivery not associated with shoulder dystocia, or even with cesarean
delivery. Shoulder dystocia is not resolved with more traction, but by maneuvers
to relieve the impaction of the anterior shoulder (Table 11–1).
The diagnosis is made when external rotation of the fetal head is difficult, and
the fetal head may retract back toward the maternal introitus, the “turtle sign.”
The first actions are nonmanipulative of the fetus, such as the McRoberts maneuver and suprapubic pressure. Fundal pressure should be avoided when shoulder
dystocia is diagnosed because of the increased associated neonatal injury. Other
maneuvers include the Wood’s corkscrew (progressively rotating the posterior
shoulder in 180° in a corkscrew fashion), delivery of the posterior arm, and the
Zavanelli maneuver (cephalic replacement with immediate cesarean section).

105

One area of controversy is the practice of cesarean delivery in certain circumstances in an attempt to avoid shoulder dystocia; indications include
macrosomia diagnosed on ultrasound, particularly with maternal gestational
diabetes. Because of the imprecision of estimated fetal weights and prediction
of shoulder dystocia, there is no uniform agreement regarding this practice.
Operative vaginal delivery, such as vacuum or forceps-assisted deliveries in
the face of possible fetal macrosomia, may possibly increase the risk of shoulder
dystocia.

Comprehension Questions

Which of the following is a risk factor for shoulder dystocia?
A. Maternal gestational diabetes
B. Fetal hydrocephalus
C. Fetal prematurity
D. Precipitous (fast) labor

106

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
11.1

A. Gestational diabetes is a risk factor because the fetal shoulders
and abdomen are disproportionately bigger than the head, therefore
the head may pass through with no problems, yet it is quite difficult
to deliver the anterior shoulder since it is lodged behind the maternal symphysis pubis. The McRoberts maneuver and application of
suprapubic pressure are two techniques that attempt to relieve the
impaction of the anterior shoulder. Unlike gestational diabetes, the
complication with hydrocephalus is that the fetal head is greater
than the body. The head itself may have a difficult time passing
through the pelvis, but if it does pass, the shoulders would have no
problem passing through since their width would be smaller than the
width of the fetal head. The premature fetus typically has a wellproportioned body, but is overall smaller in size than the averagesized baby. No part of a premature fetus’ body should typically get
impacted anywhere along the birth canal. With precipitous labor,
there is a decreased chance that a shoulder dystocia will occur,
whereas a prolonged second stage of labor should raise suspicion that
a dystocia is present.

11.2

B. The patient in this question has shoulder dystocia. The McRoberts
maneuver or suprapubic pressure is generally the first maneuver used.
The McRoberts maneuver involves sharply flexing the maternal
thighs against the maternal abdomen to straighten the sacrum relative
to the lumbar spine and rotate the symphysis pubis anteriorly toward
the maternal head. Applying suprapubic pressure, or pushing on the
suprapubic region, relieves the fetal shoulder from being impacted
behind the symphysis pubis. The internal podalic version is an obstetric procedure in which the fetus, typically in a transverse position, is
rotated inside the womb to where the feet or a foot is the presenting
part during labor and delivery. This method would not be applicable
in this situation because the fetus is presenting in the proper cephalic
position. Fracturing of the fetal humerus is a complication that can
occur with shoulder dystocia if one of the fetal arms is pulled or tugged
on too forcefully. Attempting to deliver the anterior shoulder in the
setting of shoulder dystocia can result in a brachial plexus injury
involving the C5-C6 nerve roots. As a result, the baby could have
weakness of the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles as well as the flexor
muscles of the forearm (Erb palsy/“Waiter’s tip”).

11.3

B. With delivery of the posterior arm, the shoulder girdle diameter is
reduced from shoulder-to-shoulder to shoulder-to-axilla, which usually
allows the fetus to deliver.

CLINICAL CASES

107

11.4

A. The McRoberts maneuver causes anterior rotation of the symphysis
pubis and flattening of the lumbar spine. This relieves the anterior
shoulder from impaction and allows for delivery of the fetus. Separating
the symphysis pubis is not associated with any kind of mechanism or
maneuver for relieving shoulder dystocia. Fracturing the humerus is
never indicated either, and may also lead to brachial plexus injury.

11.5

D. The rationale of suprapubic pressure is to move the fetal shoulders
from the anteroposterior to an oblique plane, allowing the shoulder
to slip out from under the symphysis pubis. Applying fundal pressure
would only supply a greater force of the fetal shoulder against the
symphysis pubis and possibly cause a more complex and serious situation such as brachial plexus injury to the fetus.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Shoulder dystocia cannot be predicted nor prevented in the majority of
cases.
➤ The biggest risk factor for shoulder dystocia is fetal macrosomia, particularly in a woman who has gestational diabetes.
➤ The estimation of fetal weight is most often inaccurate, as is the diagnosis
of macrosomia.
➤ The most common injury to the neonate in a shoulder dystocia is brachial
plexus injury, such as Erb palsy.
➤ The first actions for shoulder dystocia are generally the McRoberts maneuver or suprapubic pressure.
➤ Fundal pressure should not be used once shoulder dystocia is encountered.

ANSWERS TO CASE 12:
Ureteral Injury after Hysterectomy
Summary: A 45-year-old woman who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy for symptomatic endometriosis 2 days previously has right flank tenderness, fever of 102°F (38.8°C), and exquisite costovertebral angle tenderness.
The incision appears normal.
➤

Next step: Intravenous pyelogram (IVP), or CT scan of the abdomen with
intravenous contrast.

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Right ureteral obstruction or injury.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that the urinary tract is sometimes injured in pelvic surgery.
2. Know the common presentations of ureteral and bladder injuries after
gynecologic surgery.
3. Know some of the conditions that predispose patients to urinary tract
injury.

Considerations
This patient has a clinical picture identical to pyelonephritis; however, because
she has recently undergone a hysterectomy, injury to or obstruction of the ureter
is of paramount concern. Endometriosis tends to obliterate tissue planes, making ureteral injury more likely. The intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is the best initial test to evaluate this disorder, although a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
with intravenous contrast would also be diagnostic. If the same clinical picture
were present without the recent surgery, then the most likely diagnosis would
be pyelonephritis and the next step would be intravenous antibiotics and urine
culture. Finally, the wound is normal, which argues against a wound infection
causing the postoperative fever.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Ureteral Injuries
DEFINITIONS
CARDINAL LIGAMENT: The attachments of the uterine cervix to the pelvic
side walls through which the uterine arteries traverse.
INTRAVENOUS PYELOGRAM: Radiologic study in which intravenous dye
is injected and radiographs are taken of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.
HYDRONEPHROSIS: Dilation of the renal collecting system, which gives
evidence of urinary obstruction.
CYSTOSCOPY: Procedure whereby a scope is placed into the bladder via the
urethra. Various procedures, such as placement of stents into the ureters, can
be performed.
PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROSTOMY: Placement of a stent into the renal
pelvis through the skin under radiologic guidance to relieve a urinary obstruction.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Up to 1% of abdominal hysterectomies can be complicated by ureteral injury.
Cancer, extensive adhesions, endometriosis, tubo-ovarian abscess, residual
ovaries, and interligamentous leiomyomata are risk factors. Any gynecologic
procedure, including laparoscopy or vaginal hysterectomy, may result in ureteral
injury; however, the majority of the injuries are associated with abdominal hysterectomy. The most common location for ureteral injury is at the cardinal ligament, where the ureter is only 2- to 3-cm lateral to the cervix. The ureter is
just under the uterine artery, “water under the bridge” (Figure 12–1). Other
locations of ureteral injuries include the pelvic brim, which occur during the ligation of the ovarian vessels (infundibular pelvic ligament), and at the point at
which the ureter enters the bladder (anterior to the vagina, when the vaginal
cuff is ligated at the end of the hysterectomy). Ureteral injuries include suture
ligation, transsection, crushing with clamps, ischemia-induced damage from
stripping the blood supply, and laparoscopic injury.
If the IVP shows possible obstruction with hydronephrosis and/or hydroureter
(Figure 12–2), the next steps include antibiotic administration and cystoscopy to
attempt retrograde stent passage. This procedure is performed in the hope that the
ureter is kinked but not occluded. Relief of the obstruction is paramount in preventing renal damage. The decision for immediate ureteral repair versus initial
percutaneous nephrostomy with later ureteral repair should be individualized.
In general, bladder lacerations on the dome (top) of the bladder can be
sutured at the time of surgery; however, injury in the trigone area (lower) may
need ureteral stent placement to prevent ureteral stricture.

A 55-year-old woman undergoes a total abdominal hysterectomy and
develops fever and flank tenderness.

12.2

A 33-year-old woman undergoes pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical
cancer. During the procedure, the right ureter is meticulously and
cleanly dissected free and a Penrose drain is placed around it to ensure
its safety. She is asymptomatic until postoperative day 9, when she
develops profuse nausea and vomiting, and is noted to have ascites on
ultrasound.

12.3

A 55-year-old woman, who underwent a vaginal hysterectomy for
third-degree vaginal prolapse 1 month ago, complains of constant leakage of fluid per vagina of 7 days duration.

12.4

A 44-year-old woman undergoes a right salpingo-ophorectomy laparoscopically. Bipolar cautery is used to ligate the infundibular pelvic ligament. The next day, she complains of fever and flank tenderness.

ANSWERS
12.1

B. There are many risk factors associated with ureteral injury; however
the majority are associated with abdominal hysterectomies. Other risk
factors include: cancer, extensive adhesions, endometriosis, tubo-ovarian
abscess, residual ovaries, interligamentous leiomyomata, and most
gynecological procedures. Also, the presentation of fever and flank
tenderness after surgery makes the diagnosis of ureteral ligation most
likely in comparison to the other options. When the ureter is ligated,
the patient is at an increased risk of hydronephrosis and/or
hydroureter. Antibiotic treatment and relief of the obstruction should
be administered promptly to avoid the situation in this scenario of
pyelonephritis. Patients with a bladder perforation injury typically
present with gross hematuria, pain, or tenderness in the suprapubic
region and difficulty in voiding. Ureters are not typically “dissected
out” during a hysterectomy; therefore it would be unlikely for ischemia
to occur in this situation.

116

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

12.2

C. Overdissection of the ureter may lead to devascularization injury
because the ureter receives its blood supply from various arteries
along its course and flows along its adventitial sheath. Urine is
leaked into the abdominal cavity and causes irritation to the intestines and induces nausea and emesis. With a vesicovaginal fistula,
urine is continuously leaking out the vagina, but not into the abdominal cavity. Nausea and vomiting are not associated with any of the
other answer choices except for bladder perforation. In bladder perforation injuries, patients present with pain in the suprapubic region.

12.3

A. Constant urinary leakage after pelvic surgery is a typical history for
vesicovaginal fistula (see Case 1). In other words, there is constant
connection between the bladder and vagina. Any type of pelvic surgery predisposes to fistula formation. Surgery is necessary to remove
the fistula.

12.4

D. Thermal injury can spread from cauterized tissue to surrounding
structures. As with the patient diagnosed with a ureteral ligation,
this patient presents with fever and flank tenderness. The fact that
the procedure in this scenario was performed using bipolar cautery,
the likelihood that the symptoms deal with thermal injury versus ligation is much higher.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Ureteral injury should be suspected when a patient develops flank tenderness and fever after a hysterectomy or oophorectomy.
➤ Meticulous ureteral dissection can lead to devascularization injury to the
ureter since the vascular channels run along the adventitia of the ureter.
➤ A fistula should be considered when there is constant leakage of drainage
from the vagina after surgery or radiation therapy.
➤ An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is the imaging test of choice to assess a
postoperative patient with a suspected ureteral injury.

ANSWERS TO CASE 13:
Postmenopausal Bleeding
Summary: A 66-year-old diabetic, nulliparous woman complains of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. Prior to menopause, which occurred at age 55, she
had irregular menses. She denies the use of estrogen replacement therapy. Her
examination is significant for obesity and hypertension.
➤

Next step: Perform an endometrial biopsy.

➤

Concern: Endometrial cancer.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that postmenopausal bleeding requires endometrial sampling
to assess for endometrial cancer.
2. Know the risk factors for endometrial cancer.
3. Know that endometrial cancer is staged surgically.

Considerations
This patient has postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, which should always be
investigated, because it can indicate malignant or premalignant conditions.
The biggest concern should be endometrial cancer. She also has numerous
risk factors for endometrial cancer including obesity, diabetes, hypertension,
prior anovulation (irregular menses), late menopause, and nulliparity. The
endometrial sampling or aspiration can be performed in the office by placing
a thin, flexible catheter through the cervix. It is the initial test of choice to
assess for endometrial cancer. This patient is not taking unopposed estrogen
replacement therapy, which would be another risk factor. If endometrial cancer were diagnosed, the patient would need surgical staging. If the endometrial sampling is negative for cancer, another cause for postmenopausal
bleeding, such as atrophic endometrium, is possible. A blind sampling of the
endometrium, such as with the endometrial biopsy device, has 90% to 95%
sensitivity for detecting cancer. If this patient, who has so many risk factors
for endometrial cancer, were to have a negative endometrial sampling, many
practitioners would go to a direct visualization of the endometrial cavity, such
as hysteroscopy. If the clinician were to elect to observe this patient after the
endometrial biopsy, any further bleeding episodes would necessitate further
investigation.

CLINICAL CASES

119

APPROACH TO
Postmenopausal Bleeding
DEFINITIONS
ENDOMETRIAL SAMPLING (BIOPSY): A thin catheter is introduced through

the cervix into the uterine cavity under some suction to aspirate endometrial
cells.
ENDOMETRIAL POLYPS: A growth of endometrial glands and stroma, which
projects into the uterine cavity, usually on a stalk; it can cause postmenopausal
bleeding.
ATROPHIC ENDOMETRIUM: The most common cause of postmenopausal
bleeding is friable tissue of the endometrium or vagina due to low estrogen
levels.
ENDOMETRIAL STRIPE: Transvaginal sonographic assessment of the endometrial thickness; a thickness greater than 5 mm is abnormal in a postmenopausal
woman.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Postmenopausal bleeding always needs to be investigated because it can indicate
malignant disorders and premalignant conditions, such as endometrial hyperplasia. Notably, complex hyperplasia with atypia is associated with endometrial carcinoma in 30% to 50% of cases.
Approximately 20% of postmenopausal women not on hormonal therapy
but complaining of vaginal bleeding will have an endometrial carcinoma. The
most common etiology of postmenopausal bleeding is atrophic endometritis or
vaginitis; also, vaginal spotting can occur in a patient taking hormonal therapy.
However, since endometrial malignancy can coexist with atrophic changes or
in women taking hormone replacement therapy, endometrial carcinoma must
be ruled out in any patient with postmenopausal bleeding. Possible methods
for assessment of the endometrium include endometrial sampling, hysteroscopy,
or vaginal sonography.
Risk factors for endometrial cancer are listed in Table 13–1. They primarily
include conditions of estrogen exposure without progesterone. Although
endometrial cancer typically affects older women, a woman in her 30s with a
history of chronic anovulation, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, may be
affected. When the endometrial sampling is unrevealing, the patient with persistent postmenopausal bleeding, or with numerous risk factors for endometrial
cancer, should undergo further evaluation, such as by hysteroscopy. Direct
visualization of the intrauterine cavity can identify small lesions that may be

Endometrial carcinoma is the most common female genital tract malignancy. Although endometrial cancer is not the most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding, it is usually the one of most concern. Fortunately because
endometrial cancer is associated with an early symptom, postmenopausal bleeding, it is usually detected at an early stage. Once diagnosed, endometrial cancer
is staged surgically (Table 13–2). Sometimes endometrial cancer may occur in
the atypical patient, such as a thin patient; these cancers tend to be more
aggressive.

D. Progestin therapy
E. Surgical therapy

122

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
13.1

C. Diabetes mellitus is associated with endometrial cancer. Other
risk factors include early menarche, late menopause, obesity, chronic
anovulation, estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors, hypertension, family history, and, the biggest risk factor, ingestion of unopposed estrogen. Taking a combination oral contraceptive decreases the risk of
endometrial cancer due to the progestin component in the pill that
prevents the endometrium from becoming hyperprolific. Smoking is
associated with a lower estrogenic state, which would, therefore, also
decrease a patient’s risk for endometrial cancer. But this poses a
major public health risk, since smoking itself is associated with an
overall increase in morbidity and mortality. Multiparity decreases the
risk of endometrial cancer as well, and herpes simplex infection does
not influence a patient’s chance of acquiring endometrial cancer.

13.2

B. Atypical glandular cells on the Pap smear may indicate endocervical or endometrial cancer. Therefore, a colposcopic examination of
the cervix, curettage of the endocervix, and endometrial sampling
are indicated. Because endometrial carcinoma is the most common
female genital tract malignancy and is very treatable (as is endocervical cancer) when detected at an early stage, the benefit of using
multiple techniques to further examine the cervix and endometrium
at a microscopic level is cost effective, specific, and should not be
delayed. Delaying further investigation by repeating a Pap smear in
3 months may allow progression of any sort of malignancy the
patient might have. Also, an abnormal Pap smear is not very specific,
so waiting to repeat the test and retrieving abnormal results again
would still not specify whether or not the patient has endometrial
cancer, endocervical cancer, or another pathologic process. Vaginal
sampling would not give us information as to the patient’s likelihood
of having an endometrial or cervical malignancy. In addition, vaginal cancer is not nearly as common as endometrial or endocervical
cancer and it would not be cost effective if there are no symptoms
associated with vaginal carcinoma. Hormone replacement therapy
(estrogen) would either worsen the patient’s endometrial hyperplasia
and atypia or put the patient at an increased risk for endometrial
cancer if it is not present already. Unopposed estrogens increase the
proliferation of endometrial cells and the likelihood of developing
endometrial hyperplasia and eventually endometrial carcinoma.

CLINICAL CASES

123

13.3

C. Persistent postmenopausal bleeding, especially in a woman with risk
factors for endometrial cancer, must be pursued. Hysteroscopy would be
very cost effective in this patient, who, in addition to many risk factors,
presents with postmenopausal bleeding. Hysteroscopy is one of the best
methods for assessing the uterine cavity since it allows for direct visualization of the uterine cavity. Continued observation and reassurance
would not be indicated since there is a high suspicion that this patient
may be presenting with endometrial cancer. Any delay in treatment
may allow progression of the cancer, making it more difficult to treat,
and reassurance would be misleading. Unopposed estrogen replacement
therapy would not be indicated for this patient who already has so many
risk factors and symptoms for endometrial cancer. Endometrial ablation
may be beneficial in stopping bleeding in patients with menorrhagia
who no longer wishes to bear children, but it is not a method for diagnosing or treating endometrial carcinoma. This patient would continue
to bleed despite an endometrial ablation because of her high estrogenic
state, and ablation would delay the diagnosis and treatment. The serum
antigen CA-125 is not a specific cancer marker, and is mostly associated with epithelial tumors of the ovary.

13.4

E. Surgical treatment is a fundamental aspect of the treatment and
staging of endometrial carcinoma. Radiotherapy is used as an adjunctive treatment when the surgery performed for staging shows high
suspicion of possible spread. Chemotherapy would be indicated if the
surgery revealed metastasis. Progestin therapy is effective in shedding
the endometrial lining, but not at inhibiting cellular proliferation.
Once the endometrial cells become complex and atypical, progesterone is ineffective.

Clinical Pearls
➤ An endometrial sampling should be performed in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding to assess for endometrial carcinoma.
➤ Unopposed estrogen is generally the biggest risk factor for the development of endometrial cancer.
➤ Endometrial cancer is staged surgically and surgery is a fundamental part
of its treatment.
➤ Persistent postmenopausal bleeding warrants further investigation (such
as hysteroscopy) even after a normal endometrial sampling.
➤ Endometrial cancer is usually discovered at an early stage due to an early
symptom: postmenopausal bleeding.
➤ When endometrial cancer occurs in an atypical patient without a history of
anovulation, it tends to be more aggressive.

ANSWERS TO CASE 14:
Placenta Previa
Summary: A 30-year-old G5 P4 woman at 32 weeks’ gestation complains of
painless vaginal bleeding. Four weeks previously, she experienced some postcoital vaginal spotting. The abdomen is soft and uterus nontender. Fetal heart
tones are in the range of 140 to 150 bpm.
➤

Next step: Ultrasound examination.

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Placenta previa.

➤

Long-term management : Expectant management as long as the bleeding is
not excessive. Cesarean delivery at 36 to 37 weeks’ gestation.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the differential diagnosis of antepartum bleeding.
2. Understand that painless vaginal bleeding is consistent with placenta previa.
3. Understand that the ultrasound examination is a good method for assessing placental location.

Considerations
The patient experiences antepartum vaginal bleeding (bleeding after 20 weeks’
gestation). Because of the painless nature of the bleeding and lack of risk factors for placental abruption, this case is more likely to be placenta previa,
defined as the placenta overlying the internal os of the cervix. Placenta abruption (premature separation of the placenta) usually is associated with painful
uterine contractions or excess uterine tone. The history of postcoital spotting
earlier during the pregnancy is consistent with previa, since vaginal intercourse
may induce bleeding. The ultrasound examination is performed before a vaginal examination because vaginal manipulation (even a speculum examination) may induce bleeding. Because the patient is hemodynamically stable, and
the fetal heart tones are normal, expectant management is the best therapy at
32 weeks’ gestation (due to the prematurity risks). If the same patient were at
35 to 36 weeks’ gestation, then delivery by cesarean section would be prudent.

CLINICAL CASES

127

APPROACH TO
Antepartum Vaginal Bleeding
DEFINITIONS
ANTEPARTUM VAGINAL BLEEDING: Vaginal bleeding occurring after

20 weeks’ gestation.
COMPLETE PLACENTA PREVIA: The placenta completely covers the
internal os of the uterine cervix (Figure 14–1).
PARTIAL PLACENTA PREVIA: The placenta partially covers the internal
cervical os.
MARGINAL PLACENTA PREVIA: The placenta abuts against the internal
os of the cervix.
LOW-LYING PLACENTA: The edge of the placenta is within 2 to 3 cm of the
internal cervical os.
PLACENTAL ABRUPTION: Premature separation of a normally implanted
placenta.
VASA PREVIA: Umbilical cord vessels that insert into the membranes with
the vessels overlying the internal cervical os, thus being vulnerable to fetal
exsanguination upon rupture of membranes.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Antepartum hemorrhage is defined as significant vaginal bleeding after
20 weeks’ gestation. The two most common causes of significant antepartum
bleeding are placenta abruption and placenta previa (Table 14–1). The classic
presentation of previa bleeding is painless vaginal bleeding after the mid–
second trimester, whereas placental abruption frequently presents with painful
contractions. When the patient complains of antepartum hemorrhage, the
physician should first rule out placenta previa by ultrasound even before a
speculum or digital examination, since these maneuvers may induce bleeding.
Ultrasound is an accurate method of assessing placental location. At times,
transabdominal sonography may not be able to visualize the placenta, and
transvaginal ultrasound is necessary.
The natural history of placenta previa is such that the first episode of
bleeding does not usually cause sufficient concern as to necessitate delivery.
Hence, a woman with a preterm gestation and placenta previa is usually
observed on bed rest with the hope that time may be gained for fetal maturation. Often, the second or third episode of bleeding forces delivery. The bleeding from previa rarely leads to coagulopathy, as opposed to that of placenta
abruption. At or near term (36 to 37 weeks), many practitioners will perform

an amniocentesis to establish fetal lung maturity; if the fetal lungs appear
mature, then delivery will be scheduled. The route of delivery as a general rule
is by cesarean section. Because the lower uterine segment is poorly contractile, postpartum bleeding may ensue. Also, placenta accreta (invasion of the
placenta into the uterus) is more common with placenta previa, particularly
in the presence of a uterine scar such as a cesarean.

previa on an ultrasound examination at 22 weeks’ gestation. She does
not have vaginal bleeding or spotting. Which of the following is the
most appropriate management?
A. Schedule cesarean delivery at 39 weeks.
B. Schedule an amniocentesis at 36 weeks and deliver by cesarean if

percreta involving the bladder.
D. Reassess placental position at 34 to 35 weeks’ gestation by ultrasound.
E. Recommend termination of pregnancy.

ANSWERS
14.1

C. Multiple gestation, with the increased surface area of placentation, is a risk factor for placenta previa. Hypertension is not a risk
factor for placenta previa; however it is one of the main risk factors
for placenta abruption. Polyhydramnios, due to the excess amount of
amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac, is also a risk factor for placenta
abruption. Salpingitis involves inflammation and infection of the
fallopian tubes and over time may lead to permanent scarring of the
tubes. Since this particular process is limited to the tubes, there is not
an increased risk of placenta previa; rather there is an increased risk
of ectopic pregnancy.

14.2

D. Postcoital spotting is a common complaint in a patient with placenta previa. Unlike placenta abruption, placenta previa is not commonly associated with coagulopathy, painful bleeding, or having a
profuse first episode of bleeding. The main distinguishing factor
between a previa and abruption is the presence or absence of pain.
With abruption, painful uterine contractions are typically the chief
complaint, whereas previa is painless. Although the first episode of
bleeding with a previa usually does not raise enough concern to
deliver immediately, the second or third bleeding episodes will send
the patient to the operation room (OR) for a cesarean delivery.

CLINICAL CASES

131

14.3

C. The best plan for placenta previa at term is cesarean delivery.
There is no need to place the patient at risk for hemorrhage when
the fetus’ lungs are mature enough for life outside the womb, therefore expectant management would not be the best choice for this
scenario. A patient with a scheduled cesarean delivery does not need
to be induced for labor, nor does she need tocolysis since the status
of the patient’s labor is typically insignificant in a cesarean delivery.
A patient with previa should not deliver vaginally since the lower
uterine segment is poorly contractile, and postpartum bleeding may
ensue. An intrauterine transfusion is also not indicated for this
patient because the baby is going to be delivered and will be independent of the mother’s blood supply. Even in the setting of an Rh−
mother with an Rh+ fetus, an intrauterine transfusion before delivery would pose a significantly greater risk to the mother and baby
than waiting to evaluate the situation after birth.

14.4

D. Ultrasound should be performed first to rule out previa, speculum
examination second to assess the cervix and look for lacerations, and
finally digital examination. Performing either a speculum examination or digital examination before evaluating the patient with ultrasound puts the patient at risk for hemorrhage. In the setting of a
previa, the lower uterine segment and cervix are highly vascularized,
and varices of the cervix may be visualized on speculum examination
in some situations; however, the speculum itself may cause trauma to
these varices and induce bleeding. A blind digital examination may
result in further separation of the placenta from the uterus, which
could also cause significant bleeding.

14.5

D. Very often, a marginal or low-lying placenta previa at the early
second trimester will resolve by transmigration of the placenta. It is
too early to discuss scheduling a cesarean delivery since the placenta
previa may resolve and allow for vaginal delivery. At 35 weeks, an
ultrasound should be repeated to see whether or not the placenta has
migrated. There would be no reason to be concerned about a percreta if the placenta migrates to a more favorable position; therefore
scheduling an MRI is not indicated at this time. In addition, an MRI
is expensive and only 38% sensitive. If there is suspicion that a percreta exists, a previa has most likely already been diagnosed in the late
second trimester or third trimester, so a scheduled cesarean delivery
would most likely already be in the plan. During the cesarean, the
physician will be able to assess the extent of the previa and base
management on how far the placenta has penetrated through the
uterine wall. Placenta percreta and increta are usually diagnosed during a cesarean delivery and not radiographically. Again, it would be too
early to schedule for an amniocentesis at 36 weeks since the placenta

132

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

has a chance of transmigrating. Recommending termination of pregnancy would be inappropriate in this case. Even if the patient has a
placenta previa at the time of delivery, both the mother and baby
have an excellent prognosis if a cesarean delivery is performed (see
Case 8).

Clinical Pearls
➤ Painless antepartum vaginal bleeding suggests the diagnosis of placenta
previa.
➤ Ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice in assessing placenta previa and
should be performed before digital or speculum examination.
➤ Cesarean section is the best route of delivery for placenta previa.
➤ Placenta previa, in the face of prior cesarean deliveries, increases the risk of
placenta accreta.
➤ When placenta previa is diagnosed at an early gestation, such as second
trimester, repeat sonography is warranted since many times the placenta
will move away from the cervix (transmigration).

ANALYSIS

Objectives
1. Understand that placental abruption and placenta previa are major causes
of antepartum hemorrhage.
2. Know the clinical presentation of abruptio placentae.
3. Understand that coagulopathy is a complication of placental abruption.

Considerations
The patient complains of painful antepartum bleeding, which is consistent
with placental abruption. Also, she has several risk factors for abruptio placentae, such as hypertension and cocaine use (Table 15–1). Because the natural history of placental abruption is extension of the separation, leading to
complete shearing of the placenta from the uterus, the best treatment at a gestational age near term (>34 weeks) is delivery. As opposed to the diagnosis of
placenta previa, ultrasound examination is a poor method of assessment for
abruption. This is because the freshly developed blood clot behind the placenta has the same sonographic texture as the placenta itself.

APPROACH TO
Suspected Placental Abruption
DEFINITIONS
CONCEALED ABRUPTION: When the bleeding occurs completely behind
the placenta and no external bleeding is noted; this condition is less common
than overt hemorrhage but more dangerous.
FETOMATERNAL HEMORRHAGE: Fetal blood that enters into the maternal circulation.
COUVELAIRE UTERUS: Bleeding into the myometrium of the uterus giving
a discolored appearance to the uterine surface.

CLINICAL APPROACH
As compared to placenta previa, abruptio placentae is more dangerous and
unpredictable. Furthermore, the diagnosis is much more difficult to establish.
Ultrasound examination is not helpful in the majority of cases; a normal ultrasound examination does not rule out placental abruption. There is no one test
that is diagnostic of placental abruption, but rather the clinical picture must
be taken as a whole. Thus, a patient at risk for abruptio placentae (a hypertensive patient or one who has recently been involved in a motor vehicle
accident), who complains of vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks’ gestation, must
be suspected of having a placental abruption. Furthermore, the bleeding is
often associated with uterine pain or hypertonus. The blood may seep into the
uterine muscle and cause a reddish discoloration also known as the
“Couvelaire uterus.” Uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage after delivery
may occur. Upon delivery, a blood clot adherent to the placenta is often seen.

136

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Another complication of abruption is coagulopathy. When the abruption is
of sufficient severity to cause fetal death, coagulopathy is found in one-third
or more of cases. The coagulopathy is secondary to hypofibrinogenemia, and
clinically evident bleeding is usually not encountered unless the fibrinogen
level is below 100 to 150 mg/dL.
The diagnosis of placental abruption is difficult because the clinical presentation is variable. Although painful vaginal bleeding is the hallmark, preterm
labor, stillbirth, and/or fetal heart rate abnormalities also may be seen. Ultrasound
diagnosis is not sensitive. A concealed abruption can occur when blood is trapped
behind the placenta, so that external hemorrhage is not seen. Serial hemoglobin
levels, following the fundal height and assessment of the fetal heart rate pattern,
are often helpful. Fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage is more common with placental
abruption, and some practitioners recommend testing for fetal erythrocytes from
the maternal blood. One such test of acid elution methodology is called the
Kleihauer–Betke test, which takes advantage of the different solubilities of maternal versus fetal hemoglobin.
The management of placental abruption is dependent on the fetal gestational age, fetal status, and the hemodynamic status of the mother. Delivery is
the usual management! In a woman with a premature fetus and a diagnosis of
“chronic abruption,” expectant management may be exercised if the patient is
stable with no active bleeding or signs of fetal compromise. Although there is
no contraindication to vaginal delivery, cesarean section is often the chosen
route of delivery for fetal indications. In cases of abruptions that are associated
with fetal death and coagulopathy, the vaginal route is most often the safest for
the mother. In the latter scenario, blood products and intravenous fluids are
given to maintain the hematocrit above 25% to 30% and a urine output of at
least 30 mL/h. These women generally have very rapid labors. Many of these
women will manifest hypertension or preeclampsia following volume replacement and it may be necessary to start magnesium sulfate for seizure (eclampsia
prophylaxis).

30 weeks’ gestation. Her urine drug screen is positive. Which of the
following is most likely to be present in her drug screen?
A. Marijuana
B. Alcohol
C. Barbiturates
D. Cocaine
E. Benzodiazepines

ANSWERS
15.1

A. Placenta abruption is a common cause of coagulopathy.
Consumptive coagulopathy, also known as disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC), involves the overactivation of the procoagulant
pathways and can be a fatal complication of a placenta abruption or
other causes of hemorrhage. Placenta previa rarely results in consumptive coagulopathy, since there is usually a significantly less amount of
bleeding involved in comparison with abruption. Gestational diabetes
is more commonly associated with fetal macrosomia, and places the
fetus at risk for shoulder dystocia at the time of delivery. Coagulopathy
is not likely to be seen in gestational diabetes. A multifetal gestation
puts a patient at a higher risk for a placenta previa due to the larger
surface area required for the placenta(s), but as mentioned before,
coagulopathy is not common in previa and the multifetal gestation

138

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

itself does not increase maternal risk of coagulopathy either.
Gestational trophoblastic disease can be a benign or malignant cancer
that develops in a woman’s womb and is commonly associated with a
molar pregnancy. Bleeding from a site of metastasis may lead to hemorrhagic shock, but this is not very common, and therefore the chance
of developing DIC from this complication is even less likely.
15.2

D. Sonography is accurate in identifying previa, but not sensitive in
diagnosing placental abruption. An ultrasound examination is a poor
method for assessment of abruption because the freshly developed
blood clot behind the placenta has the same sonographic texture as
the placenta itself. High suspicions must be exercised from evaluating
the clinical picture as a whole for diagnosing abruption. An extra
challenging situation exists in the setting of a concealed abruption in
which the bleeding occurs behind the placenta and no external bleeding is noted. This is extremely dangerous since a greater amount of
time will most likely pass before the abruption is diagnosed.

15.3

C. Trauma is the most significant risk factor for abruption in comparison to the other answer choices. Extreme forces can shear the placenta away from the uterus in these situations. Marijuana, as opposed
to cocaine, is not associated with abruption since it does not cause
maternal hypertension and vasoconstriction like cocaine. A prior
cesarean delivery may predispose a patient to placenta previa with an
associated accreta in future pregnancies, but neither a prior cesarean
delivery nor an accreta is significant risk factors for abruption. The
most significant risk factor of breech presentation of the fetus is cord
prolapse, which can lead to significant oxygen deprivation to the
fetus. Other risk factors for placental abruption include: uterine
leiomyomata (especially submucosal type), hypertension, cocaine use,
short umbilical cord, uteroplacental insufficiency, hydramnios, smoking, and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).

15.4

D. Cocaine use is strongly associated with the development of placental abruption.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Painful antepartum bleeding should make one suspicious of placental
abruption.
➤ The major risk factors for abruptio placentae are hypertension, trauma, and
cocaine use.
➤ A concealed abruption may hide significant bleeding without external
hemorrhage.
➤ The most common cause of antepartum bleeding with coagulopathy is
abruptio placentae.
➤ Placental abruption may lead to fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage.

Cervical Cancer
Summary: A 50-year-old G5 P5 woman complains of a 6-month history of
postcoital spotting and malodorous vaginal discharge. She has had a prior
infection with syphilis, and is a smoker. The speculum examination reveals a
3-cm exophytic lesion on the anterior lip of the cervix.
➤

Next step: Biopsy of the cervical lesion.

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Cervical cancer.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that a cervical biopsy and not a Pap smear (which is actually
a screening test) is the best diagnostic procedure when a cervical lesion is
seen.
2. Know that postcoital spotting is a symptom of cervical cancer.
3. Know the risk factors for cervical cancer.

Considerations
This 50-year-old woman presents with postcoital spotting. Abnormal vaginal
bleeding is the most common presenting symptom of invasive cervical cancer,
and in sexually active women, postcoital spotting is common. This patient’s age
is close to the mean age of presentation of cervical cancer, 51 years. She also
complains of a malodorous vaginal discharge that is because of the large, necrotic
tumor. Notably, the woman does not have flank tenderness, which would be a
result of metastatic obstruction of the ureter, leading to hydronephrosis. A cervical biopsy and not Pap smear is the best diagnostic test to evaluate a cervical
mass. A Pap smear is a screening test and appropriate for a woman with a normalappearing cervix.
Risk factors for cervical cancer in this woman include multiparity, cigarette
smoking, and history of a sexually transmitted disease (syphilis). Other risk
factors not mentioned would be early age of coitus, multiple sexual partners,
and HIV infection (Table 16–1).

APPROACH TO
Cervical Cancer
DEFINITIONS
CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA: Preinvasive lesions of the

cervix with abnormal cellular maturation, nuclear enlargement, and atypia.
HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS: Circular, double-stranded DNA virus that can

become incorporated into cervical squamous epithelium, predisposing the
cells for dysplasia and/or cancer.
RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY: Removal of the uterus, cervix, and supportive
ligaments, such as the cardinal ligament, uterosacral ligament, and proximal
vagina.
RADIATION BRACHYTHERAPY: Radioactive implants placed near the
tumor bed.
RADIATION TELETHERAPY: External beam radiation where the target is at
some distance from the radiation source.
HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) VACCINE: Killed virus vaccine, FDA
approved, for females aged 9 to 26. The quadrivalent vaccine contains antigens of HPV types 16 and 18 (which are associated with about 50% of cervical cancer and dysplasia) and 6 and 11 (which cause venereal warts).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Cervical Cancer
When a woman presents with postcoital spotting or has an abnormal Pap
smear, cervical dysplasia or cancer should be suspected. An abnormal Pap
smear is usually evaluated by colposcopy with biopsies, in which the cervix is

144

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

soaked with 3% or 5% acetic acid solution. The colposcope is a binocular
magnifying device that allows visual examination of the cervix. The majority
of cervical dysplasia and cancers arise near the squamocolumnar junction
of the cervix. Many times, cervical intraepithelial lesions will turn white with
the addition of acetic acid, the so-called “acetowhite change.” Along with the
change in color, dysplastic lesions will often have vascular changes, reflecting
the more rapidly growing process; in fact, the vascular pattern usually characterizes the severity of the disease. An example of mild vascular pattern is
punctations (vessels seen end-on) versus atypical vessels (such as corkscrew
and hairpin vessels). A biopsy of the worst-appearing area should be taken
during colposcopy for histologic diagnosis. Hence, the next step to evaluate
an abnormal Pap smear is colposcopic examinations with directed biopsies.
When a woman presents with a cervical mass, biopsy of the mass, not a
Pap smear, is appropriate. Because the Pap smear is a screening test, used for
asymptomatic women, it is not the best test when a mass is visible. The
Papanicolaou smear test has a false-negative rate and may give false reassurance.
When cervical cancer is diagnosed, then the next step is to stage the severity.
Cervical cancer is staged clinically (Table 16–2). Early cervical cancer (contained
within the cervix) may be treated equally well with surgery (radical hysterectomy)
or radiation therapy. However, advanced cervical cancer is best treated with
radiotherapy, consisting of brachytherapy (implants) with teletherapy (whole
pelvis radiation) along with chemotherapy, usually platinum-based (cis-platinum),
to sensitize the tissue to the radiotherapy. Since HPV is the etiologic agent in the
vast majority of cervical cancer, the advent of the HPV vaccine promises to prevent much of cervical dysplasia and cancer. The quadrivalent vaccine has been
granted FDA approval to be used in females aged 9 to 26. It consists of the antigens of HPV subtypes 6 and 11, which cause the majority of condyloma accuminata (venereal warts), and more importantly subtypes 16 and 18, which cause
50% to 70% of cervical cancer. Clinical research seems to indicate a protection
against the acquisition of HPV infection from these subtypes; however, because
other subtypes can still cause cervical dysplasia or cancer, regular Pap smears are
still required even after vaccination. Ideally, the vaccine should be administered
at an age prior to sexual activity. Cervical cancer often spreads through the cardinal ligaments toward the pelvic sidewalls. It can obstruct one or both ureters

leading to hydronephrosis. In fact, bilateral ureteral obstruction leading to uremia
is the most common cause of death due to this disease.

Pap Smear and Cervical Cancer Prevention
The purpose of cervical cytology is to detect premalignant conditions, and
intervene before it becomes invasive cancer. In general, abnormal Pap smears
as a screening test require colposcopy and biopsy to determine the full extent
of the dysplasia. Recently, the strategy of cervical cytology has undergone substantial changes due to the availability of HPV testing, and recognition that
adolescents often clear the HPV and dysplasia spontaneously.
Cervical cytology is generally begun 3 years after onset of sexual activity, or
by age 21 years. Annual Pap smear is then recommended up to age 30 years.
If the annual cytology has been negative, then at age 30, the interval of screening can be extended to every 2 to 3 years. Also, after age 30, if cervical cytology
and HPV subtype testing are both negative, Pap smear do not need to be performed any sooner than every 3 years. Finally, routine cervical cytology is not
recommended in women who have had a total hysterectomy for benign indications, and no history of cervical dysplasia. However, if hysterectomy is performed for cervical dysplasia (ie, CIN III [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
III]), then Pap smear of the vaginal cuff is still needed. HPV typing is helpful in triaging cytology showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), but is generally not helpful with any higher dysplasia. Thus,
cytology showing low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) generally requires colposcopic
examination. Adolescents and pregnant women with ASCUS may be observed
instead of immediate colposcopy or even HPV testing.

A 47-year-old woman G4 P4 has a Pap smear which shows HGSIL.
Colposcopy is performed which is adequate, and reveals CIN III. An
endocervical curettage is negative. The patient also has menorrhagia
caused by uterine fibroids. Thus, the patient undergoes a total abdominal

vaginal cuff.
B. The patient should have Pap smears every 2 to 3 years, which may
be discontinued if negative after 10 years.
C. The patient does not need Pap smears any longer.
D. The patient should have the HPV vaccine.

ANSWERS
16.1

B. HPV subtypes 6 and 11 are associated with condylomata acuminata
(venereal warts), whereas subtypes 16 and 18 are associated with cervical dysplasia and cancer. The other answer choices are uncommon
subtypes and not associated with cervical cancer. Cervical dysplasia or
cancer should be suspected when a woman presents with postcoital
spotting or an abnormal Pap smear.

16.2

B. For patients with advanced cervical cancer, radiotherapy is superior
to surgical therapy. Major advantages of radical hysterectomy over
radiotherapy are preservation of sexual function (owing to vaginal
agglutination caused by the radioactive implants—essentially closes the
vagina) and preservation of ovarian function. Radiotherapy can be performed on women who are poor operative candidates and is the best
therapy for advanced disease, consisting of brachytherapy and teletherapy. Advanced disease involves spread to the pelvic sidewalls or
hydronephrosis. Early-stage cervical cancer can be treated equally well
with surgery or radiation therapy. The majority of cervical dysplasia and
cancers arise near the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix and are
of the squamous, not adenomatous, type.

16.3

A. Early age of coitus, a history of STDs, early childbearing, low
socioeconomic status, HPV, HIV, cigarette smoking, and multiple
sex partners are all risk factors for developing cervical cancer. HPV
is the main risk factor, and is usually acquired from sexual exposure.
Late menopause, obesity, and nulliparity are risk factors for endometrial cancer, not cervical cancer. Family history is not shown to be a
risk factor for cervical cancer.

16.4

C. Colposcopic examination with directed biopsies is the next step
to evaluate abnormal cytology on Pap smear.

148

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

16.5

C. When high-grade SIL is present, colposcopic examination is
important. HPV typing has a role in triaging atypical cells of undetermined significance, but not HSIL. Demonstration of the entire
transformation zone during colposcopy allows biopsy of the worst
area. A cervical excisional procedure (loop electrosurgical excisional
procedure) or cone biopsy are indicated when there is the possibility
of endocervical disease.

16.6

A. When the patient has a history of cervical dysplasia, even after
total hysterectomy (removal of uterine corpus and cervix), annual
Pap smears should be performed of the vaginal cuff. This is because
vaginal cancer may arise. In contrast, when total hysterectomy is
performed for benign reasons, and no history of cervical dysplasia,
then no further Pap smears need to be performed.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The main risk factors for cervical cancer are sexually related, especially
exposure to human papillomavirus.
➤ Human papilloma virus 16 and 18 are the most commonly isolated subtypes in cervical dysplasia and cancer.
➤ Flank tenderness or leg swelling indicate advanced cervical cancer, which
is best treated by radiotherapy with a chemotherapeutic radiosensitizer.
➤ A visible lesion of the cervix should be evaluated by biopsy and not Pap
smear.
➤ An abnormal Pap smear is usually evaluated with colposcopy-directed
biopsies.
➤ The HPV vaccine is approved for females aged 9 to 26 to reduce the likelihood of cervical dysplasia or cancer, and venereal warts.
➤ Cervical cytology no longer needs to be performed after age 65 to 70 years,
and after total hysterectomy for benign reasons and when there is no history of cervical dysplasia .

ANSWERS TO CASE 17:
Amenorrhea (Sheehan Syndrome)
Summary: A 24-year-old G2 P2 woman has had amenorrhea since a vaginal
delivery complicated by postpartum hemorrhage and uterine curettage. She
was not able to lactate.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Sheehan syndrome (anterior pituitary necrosis).

➤

Other complications that are likely with this condition: Anterior pituitary
insufficiency, such as hypothyroidism or adrenocortical insufficiency.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to differentiate Sheehan syndrome from intrauterine adhesions
(Asherman syndrome).
2. Understand the mechanism of Sheehan syndrome.
3. Know the other tropic hormones that may be affected by anterior pituitary
necrosis.

Considerations
This patient developed amenorrhea from the time of her vaginal delivery that
was complicated by postpartum hemorrhage. The initial evaluation should be
a pregnancy test (which is negative). The patient also underwent a uterine
curettage in the treatment of the postpartum bleeding. In this setting, there
are two explanations: (1) Sheehan syndrome and (2) intrauterine adhesions
(Asherman syndrome). Sheehan syndrome is caused by hypotension in the
postpartum period, leading to hemorrhagic necrosis of the anterior pituitary
gland. Asherman syndrome is caused by the uterine curettage, which damages
the decidua basalis layer, rendering the endometrium unresponsive. The key
to differentiating between Sheehan syndrome and intrauterine adhesions is to
assess for whether or not the anterior pituitary is functioning, and whether the
outflow tract (uterus) is responsive to hormonal therapy. For instance, since
this patient’s history was “unable to breast-feed after delivery,” it would suggest that the anterior pituitary was not functioning (lack of prolactin). Had
the patient been able to breast-feed, then the most likely diagnosis would
have been intrauterine synechiae. This patient was given a combination oral
contraceptive agent, and if the endometrium were responsive to the hormonal
therapy, then proliferation of the endometrium should occur followed by stabilization of the endometrium with the progestin component, and then finally

153

CLINICAL CASES

bleeding when the placebo pills are taken (days 21-28). Other evidence of
anterior pituitary dysfunction may include low thyroid hormones, gonadotropin
(FSH and LH), or cortisol levels. A definitive diagnosis of IUA can be made
with a hysterosalpingogram.

APPROACH TO
Postpartum Amenorrhea
DEFINITIONS
AMENORRHEA: No menses for 6 months.
SHEEHAN SYNDROME: Anterior pituitary hemorrhagic necrosis caused by
hypertrophy of the prolactin-secreting cells in conjunction with a hypotensive episode, usually in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage. The bleeding
in the anterior pituitary induces pressure necrosis.
INTRAUTERINE ADHESIONS (ASHERMAN SYNDROME): Scar tissue
that forms in the endometrium, leading to amenorrhea caused by unresponsiveness of the endometrial tissue.
POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE: Classically defined as bleeding greater than
500 mL for a vaginal delivery and greater than 1000 mL for a cesarean delivery. From a more pathophysiologic standpoint, it is the amount of bleeding that
results in, or threatens to result in, hemodynamic instability if left unabated.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Amenorrhea can ensue after a term delivery for 2 to 3 months; breast-feeding
may inhibit the hypothalamic function, and lead to a greater duration of
amenorrhea. However, in a nonlactating woman, when no menses resumes by
12 weeks after delivery, then pathology must be suspected. Overall, the most
common cause of amenorrhea in the reproductive years is pregnancy. Hence,
a pregnancy test is the appropriate initial test. If the patient does not have a
history of postpartum hemorrhage, pursuit of hypothalamic causes, such as
hypothyroidism or hyperprolactinemia, is often fruitful. If the patient is somewhat obese, or has a history of irregular cycles, then polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) would be entertained. Findings consistent with PCOS include
a positive progestin withdrawal bleed (vaginal bleeding after the ingestion of a
progestin, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or Provera). Polycystic ovarian
syndrome is characterized by estrogen excess without progesterone, obesity,
hirsutism, and glucose intolerance. Elevated luteinizing hormone to folliclestimulating hormone ratios are often seen (eg, LH:FSH of 2:1). Polycystic
ovarian syndrome should be suspected in patients with obesity, hirsutism, and

154

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

oligomenorrhea. When women are hypoestrogenic, then two broad categories
of causes are common: hypothalamic/pituitary diseases or ovarian failure. The
FSH level can distinguish between these two causes, with an elevated FSH
indicative of ovarian failure.
The patient in this case had amenorrhea after a vaginal delivery, making
Sheehan syndrome or intrauterine adhesions the two most likely causes.
Distinguishing between the two entities involves assessing whether the patient
has normal or abnormal anterior pituitary function, or some evidence of unresponsiveness of the outflow tract to hormonal treatment (Table 17–1).
Treatment of Sheehan syndrome consists of replacement of hormones, such as
thyroxine, cortisol, and mineralocorticoid, and estrogen and progestin therapy.
Intrauterine adhesions are treated by hysteroscopic resection of the scar tissue.

156

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
17.1

A. Intrauterine adhesions are associated with a biphasic basal temperature chart that reflects normal pituitary function and normal ovulation. This indicates the presence of progesterone, which elevates
the temperature. Intrauterine adhesions usually occur after curettage
of the uterus. It is with Sheehan syndrome, and not with Asherman
syndrome, that due to anterior pituitary hemorrhagic necrosis, the
patient is unable to breast-feed after delivery, has a monophasic basal
body temperature chart, and has low cortisol levels. The necrotic
anterior pituitary is unable to secrete prolactin, FSH/LH, ACTH,
TSH, or growth hormone, and patients must take hormone replacements to restore function of the organs and systems these hormones
acted upon.

17.2

C. Sheehan syndrome involves the anterior pituitary undergoing
hemorrhagic necrosis after a hypotensive episode, usually in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage. The anterior pituitary is, therefore,
unable to secrete prolactin among a few other hormones. The posterior pituitary is not involved because it has a direct arterial supply.
Hypothyroidism is a result of Sheehan syndrome due to the low or
absent TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary. A patient may
have an associated hypotensive episode, and not a hypertensive one,
in their peripartum period caused by the postpartum hemorrhage.

17.3

E. In Asherman syndrome, large patches of endometrium are defective because of intrauterine adhesions. The endometrium is unresponsive, so estrogen exposure will have no effect on the lining of the
uterus, and therefore cannot pose a risk for endometrial hyperplasia.
Endometrial, and not myometrial scarring is involved. Pituitary
engorgement occurs during pregnancy due to the hypertrophy and
hyperplasia of lactotrophs. There is no associated increase in vascular
supply, so when postpartum hemorrhage occurs, the anterior pituitary
is particularly vulnerable to ischemia. Trophoblastic hyperplasia originates from placental tissues. It does not directly induce intrauterine
synechiae; however, if the patient undergoes a D&C for management
of the trophoblastic disease, Asherman syndrome may develop.

17.4

C. PCOS is a condition characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism where other causes have been eliminated, and possible evidence of small ovarian cysts on ultrasound. It is associated with
unopposed estrogen and estrogen excess. This setting increases the
patient’s risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer.
Osteoporosis is a risk in hypoestrogenic states, and this patient has estrogen excess, so osteoporosis is not a concern; in fact, bone mineral density is usually quite good. Vaginal atrophy is associated with estrogen

CLINICAL CASES

157

deficiency, not excess. Glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus and a
history of oligomenorrhea since menarche are consistent with the diagnosis of PCOS.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The two most common causes of secondary amenorrhea after postpartum
hemorrhage are Sheehan syndrome and intrauterine adhesions.
➤ A pregnancy test should be the first test in evaluating a woman with secondary amenorrhea.
➤ Normal function of the anterior pituitary points toward intrauterine
adhesions.
➤ Hypothyroidism or a monophasic basal body temperature chart suggests
Sheehan syndrome.
➤ The treatment of Sheehan syndrome is replacement of the hormones governed by the anterior pituitary gland.
➤ The most common cause of ovulatory dysfunction in a reproductive-aged
woman is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by
obesity, anovulation, hirsutism, glucose intolerance, and estrogen excess.

Case 18
A 22-year-old G3 P2 at 40 weeks’ gestation complains of strong uterine
contractions. She denies leakage of fluid per vagina. She denies medical
illnesses. Her antenatal history is unremarkable. On examination, the
blood pressure (BP) is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) is 85 beats per
minute (bpm), and temperature is 98°F (36.6°C). The fetal heart rate is
in the 140 to 150 bpm range. The cervix is dilated at 5 cm and the vertex is at −3 station. Upon artificial rupture of membranes, fetal bradycardia to the 70 to 80 bpm range is noted for 3 minutes without recovery.

What is your next step?

ANSWER TO CASE 18:
Fetal Bradycardia (Cord Prolapse)
Summary: A 22-year-old G3 P2 at term is in labor with a cervical dilation of
5 cm; the vertex is at −3 station. Upon artificial rupture of membranes, persistent fetal bradycardia to the 70 to 80 bpm range is noted for 3 minutes.
➤

Next step: Vaginal examination to assess for umbilical cord prolapse.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that the first step in the evaluation of fetal bradycardia in the
face of rupture of membranes should be to rule out umbilical cord prolapse.
2. Understand that the treatment for cord prolapse is emergent cesarean
delivery.
3. Know that an unengaged presenting part, or a transverse fetal lie with rupture of membranes, predisposes to cord prolapse.

Considerations
This patient has had two prior deliveries. She is currently in labor and her
cervix is 5 cm dilated. The fetal vertex is at –3 station, indicating that the fetal
head is unengaged. With artificial rupture of membranes, fetal bradycardia is
noted. This situation is very typical for a cord prolapse, where the umbilical
cord protrudes through the cervical os. Usually, the fetal head will fill the pelvis
and prevent the cord from prolapsing. However, with an unengaged fetal presentation, such as in this case, umbilical cord accidents are more likely. Thus, as
a general rule, artificial rupture of membranes should be avoided with an unengaged fetal part. Situations such as a transverse fetal lie or a footling breech presentation are also predisposing conditions. It is not uncommon for a multiparous
patient to have an unengaged fetal head during early labor. The lesson in this
case is not to rupture membranes with an unengaged fetal presentation. With
fetal bradycardia, the next step would be a digital examination of the vagina to
assess for the umbilical cord, which would feel like a rope-like structure through
the cervical os. If the umbilical cord is palpated and the diagnosis of cord prolapse confirmed, the patient should be taken for immediate cesarean delivery.
The physician should place the patient in Trendelenburg position (head down),
and keep his or her hand in the vagina to elevate the presenting part, thus keeping pressure off the cord.

161

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Fetal Bradycardia
DEFINITIONS
ENGAGEMENT: Largest transverse (biparietal) diameter of the fetal head has
negotiated the bony pelvic inlet.
FETAL BRADYCARDIA: Baseline fetal heart rate less than 110 bpm for greater
than 10 minutes.
UMBILICAL CORD PROLAPSE: Umbilical cord enters through the cervical
os presenting in front of the presenting part.
ARTIFICIAL RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES: Maneuver used to cause a rent
in the fetal chorioamniotic membranes.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The onset of fetal bradycardia should be confirmed either by internal fetal
scalp electrode or ultrasound, and distinguished from the maternal pulse rate.
The initial steps should be directed at improving maternal oxygenation and
delivery of cardiac output to the uterus. These maneuvers include (1) placement of the patient on her side to move the uterus from the great vessels, thus
improving blood return to the heart; (2) intravenous fluid bolus if the patient
is possibly volume depleted; (3) administration of 100% oxygen by face mask;
and (4) stopping oxytocin if it is being given (Table 18–1).
Simultaneously with these maneuvers, the practitioner should try to identify the cause of the bradycardia, such as hyperstimulation with oxytocin.
With this process, the uterus will be tetanic, or the uterine contractions will
be frequent (every 1 minute); often a β-agonist, such as terbutaline, given
intravenously will be helpful to relax the uterine musculature. Hypotension
due to an epidural catheter is another common cause. Intravenous hydration
is the first remedy, and if unsuccessful, then support of the blood pressure with

ephedrine, a pressor agent, is often useful. A vaginal examination when the
membranes are ruptured is “a must” to identify overt umbilical cord prolapse.
A rope-like cord will be palpated, often with pulsations (Figure 18–1). The
best treatment is elevation of the presenting part digitally, and emergent
cesarean delivery. In women with prior cesarean delivery, uterine rupture may
manifest as fetal bradycardia.

Fetal Heart Rate Assessment
The baseline fetal heart rate is normally between 110 and 160 bpm, with fetal
bradycardia less than 110 bpm, and tachycardia greater than 160 bpm. The
fetal heart rate typically has moderate variability, whereas diminished variability may be caused by sedating medications or more rarely fetal acidosis.
Accelerations are abrupt increases in fetal heart rate of at least 15 bpm lasting for 15 seconds, and typically are indicative of adequate fetal oxygenation.

CLINICAL CASES

163

Decelerations may be early, late, or variable depending on its configuration
and timing with the uterine contraction (see also Case 6).

Comprehension Questions
18.1

An 18-year-old woman, who had undergone a previous low-transverse
cesarean delivery, is admitted for active labor. During labor, an intrauterine pressure catheter displays normal uterine contractions every 3 minutes
with intensity up to 60 mm Hg. Fetal bradycardia ensues. Which of the
following statements is most accurate?
A. The normal intrauterine pressure catheter display makes uterine
rupture unlikely.
B. The most common sign of uterine rupture is a fetal heart rate
abnormality.
C. If the patient has a uterine rupture, the practitioner should wait to
see whether the heart tones return to decide on route of delivery.
D. The intrauterine pressure catheter has been found to be helpful in
preventing uterine rupture.

18.2

A 32-year-old G1 P0 woman is at 42 weeks’ gestation and being induced
for postterm pregnancy. She has had an uncomplicated pregnatal course.
Her BP is 100/60 mm Hg. The fundal height is 40 cm. Her cervix is
closed, 3 cm long, and firm on consistency. The obstetrician decides on
using a cervical ripening agent with misoprostol in the vagina.
Approximately 2 hours after placing the misoprostol, the patient has
an episode of fetal prolonged deceleration to the 80 bpm for 6 minutes.
Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the prolonged
deceleration?
A. Placental abruption
B. Sepsis
C. Umbilical cord prolapse
D. Uterine hyperstimulation

A 33-year-old G2 P1 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation in active labor is
noted to have a 10-minute episode of bradycardia on the external fetal
heart rate tracing in the range of 100 bpm, which has not resolved.
Her cervix is closed. Which of the following is the best initial step in
management of this patient?
A. Fetal scalp pH assessment
B. Emergency cesarean delivery
C. Intravenous atropine
D. Intravenous terbutaline
E. Assess maternal pulse

ANSWERS
18.1

B. The most common finding in a uterine rupture is a fetal heart rate
abnormality, such as fetal bradycardia, deep variable decelerations, or
late decelerations; the intrauterine pressure catheter has not been
found to be helpful and sometimes confuses the picture and may
delay the diagnosis of uterine rupture. Immediate cesarean section is
indicated for suspected uterine rupture.

18.2

D. Prolonged fetal decelerations or fetal bradycardia associated with misoprostol cervical ripening is typically associated with uterine hyperstimulation, defined as greater than five uterine contractions in a 10-minute
window. Although any of the prostaglandin cervical ripening agents
may induce uterine hyperstimulation, misoprostol generally is associated with a higher risk. Its benefit is the very low cost.

18.3

D. The supine position causes uterine compression on the vena cava,
which decreases the venous return of blood to the heart, leading to
supine hypotension. One important maneuver when encountering fetal
heart rate abnormalities is a positional change, such as the lateral decubitus position. Oxytocin and epidural anesthesia both can decrease oxygen delivery to the placental bed. Oxytocin may hyperstimulate the
uterus and cause frequent contractions; this then results in frequent
vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels which decreases the amount of
blood arriving to the placenta and fetus over time. Thus, stopping the
oxytocin may help improve oxygenation. An epidural can cause
hypotension in the mother which may then lead to fetal bradycardia by
also decreasing the amount of blood profusing the fetus per given time.
Morphine sulfate can cause respiratory depression in the fetus, so it
would not be a method of choice for increasing delivery of oxygen to
the fetus.

18.4

E. The first step in assessment of apparent fetal bradycardia is differentiating the fetal heart rate from the maternal pulse. This may be
done with the use of a fetal scalp electrode or ultrasound. A fetal

CLINICAL CASES

165

scalp pH is a maneuver to assess whether or not the fetus is receiving
sufficient oxygen during labor, but cannot be done with a closed
cervix. It requires at least 4 cm dilation to get a sample of blood from
the fetal scalp. It is rarely performed today. If fetal bradycardia is confirmed, various maneuvers may be implemented to improve maternal
oxygenation (placement of mother on her left side, IV fluid bolus,
100% O2 face mask, and stopping oxytocin). Simultaneously, IV
terbutaline may be given to help relax the uterine musculature in an
effort to increase blood flow and O2 supply to the fetus. If none of
these methods work, a vaginal examination may reveal a cord prolapse, in which case the best treatment is elevation of the presenting
part digitally and emergent cesarean delivery. Atropine may be used
in a nonpregnant patient to treat bradycardia or arrhythmias, but is
not indicated for fetal bradycardia.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The first steps in assessing fetal bradycardia after artificial rupture of membranes are distinguishing the heart rate from the maternal pulse rate, and
examining the vagina to assess for cord prolapse.
➤ The best therapy for umbilical cord prolapse is elevation of the presenting
part and emergency cesarean delivery.
➤ The risk of cord prolapse with a vertex presentation or frank breech presentation is very low; the risk with a footling breech or transverse lie is substantially higher.
➤ The most common finding with uterine rupture is a fetal heart rate
abnormality.
➤ The best treatment for suspected uterine rupture is immediate cesarean
delivery.

ANSWERS TO CASE 19:
Galactorrhea Due to Hypothyroidism
Summary: A 30-year-old parous woman with irregular menses notes a watery
breast discharge of 6 months’ duration. She had been treated previously with
radioactive iodine for Graves disease. The pregnancy test is negative.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Galactorrhea due to hypothyroidism.

➤

Next step: Check serum prolactin and TSH levels.

➤

Likely mechanism: Hypothyroidism is associated with an elevated thyroidreleasing hormone (TRH) level, which acts as a prolactin-releasing hormone. The hyperprolactinemia then induces the galactorrhea.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical presentation of galactorrhea.
2. Know some of the major causes of hyperprolactinemia.
3. Understand that hyperprolactinemia can induce hypothalamic dysfunction leading to oligo-ovulation and irregular menses.

Considerations
This patient complains of oligomenorrhea and a white, watery breast discharge,
which is likely to be milk (galactorrhea). The first investigation should be a
pregnancy test. Causes of galactorrhea include a pituitary adenoma, pregnancy,
breast stimulation, chest wall trauma, or hypothyroidism. She does not have
headaches or visual disturbances. This woman had been treated previously with
radioactive iodine for Graves disease and is not taking thyroid replacement.
Thus, she likely has hypothyroidism. With primary hypothyroidism, both the
thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are
elevated. TRH acts as a prolactin-releasing hormone. Hence, elevated TSH and
prolactin levels will be noted in this patient. The hyperprolactinemia inhibits
hypothalamic GnRH pulsations, leading to oligomenorrhea.

APPROACH TO
Galactorrhea
DEFINITIONS
GALACTORRHEA: Nonpuerperal watery or milky breast secretion that con-

tains neither pus nor blood. The secretion can be manifested spontaneously
or obtained only by breast examination.
PITUITARY SECRETING ADENOMA: A tumor in the pituitary gland that
produces prolactin; symptoms include galactorrhea, headache, and peripheral
vision defect (bitemporal hemianopsia).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Galactorrhea is a milky breast secretion that occurs in a nonlactating patient.
It is usually bilateral. To determine if the breast discharge is truly galactorrhea,
a smear under microscope will reveal multiple fat droplets. Patients with galactorrhea often have associated oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. See Table 19–1
for the different etiologies for hyperprolactinemia.
Galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemia require a careful diagnostic approach.
A thorough history and physical should be done. All medications that can stimulate prolactin production should be discontinued. A magnetic resonance scan
is the most sensitive test to detect pituitary adenomas, providing 1-mm resolution; it can detect virtually all microadenomas. The TRH test is useful for
patients with mildly elevated hyperprolactinemia (in the range of 20-60 ng/mL).
Those with a markedly high prolactin level, or those with neurologic symptoms, should have MRI of the pituitary. Hyperprolactinemia is a common
cause of menstrual disturbances. Hence, a woman with galactorrhea, regular

menses, and normal serum prolactin is at low risk for having a prolactinoma.
These patients can be followed with annual serum prolactin tests. However,
even in the face of normal prolactin assays, women with oligomenorrhea and
galactorrhea should undergo an anteroposterior and lateral coned-down view
of the sella turcica. If necessary, a skull MRI will confirm the diagnosis of empty
sella. Patients with secondary amenorrhea and low levels of serum estrogen
(<40 pg/mL) have a significantly greater risk of having a pituitary adenoma as
well as early onset of osteoporosis.
Women with galactorrhea but normal menses and normal serum prolactin
levels may be observed. Also, patients with microadenomas, who do not wish
to conceive, and without estrogen deficiency may be expectantly managed.
Other patients with pituitary adenomas may be offered medical management
versus surgery.
Primary hypothyroidism can lead to hyperprolactinemia and should be
treated with thyroxine. Patients with hyperprolactinemia and low estrogen
levels were once treated with bromocriptine. However, compliance with this
medication was low due to the side effects (orthostatic hypotension, fainting,
dizziness, and nausea and vomiting) and high cost. Another alternative is
exogenous estrogen. Bromocriptine is particularly useful for patients desiring
fertility. Another dopamine agonist for patients unresponsive to bromocriptine is cabergolamine, which is also available in depot form. Both bromocriptine and cabergolamine can be given vaginally if the patient does not tolerate
the oral form. Patients with hyperprolactinemia, with or without microadenoma, with adequate estrogen levels (>40 pg/mL) and who do not desire pregnancy should be treated with periodic progestin withdrawal.
Surgery involves transsphenoidal microsurgical exploration of the sella turcica with removal of the pituitary adenoma while preserving the functional
capacity of the remaining gland. Complications of the surgery include transient
diabetes insipidus (occurs in about one-third), hemorrhage, meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and panhypopituitarism. Cure rate is directly related to the
pretreatment prolactin levels (prolactin level of 100 ng/mL has an excellent
prognosis, whereas 200 ng/mL has a poor prognosis). It may be preferable to
reduce the size of the macroadenoma with bromocriptine before surgical
removal of these tumors. Surgery, which is associated with some adverse effects,
is usually reserved as secondary management in patients who have a macroadenoma with complete or partial failure of medical treatment or poor compliance.

172

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
19.1

C. Medications are a common cause of hyperprolactinemia, especially psychotropic medications. Pregnancy is associated with elevated prolactin levels. The anterior, not posterior, pituitary secretes
prolactin; an anterior pituitary adenoma is more likely to be a cause
of hyperprolactinemia. Symptoms may include galactorrhea, headache,
and peripheral vision defect (bitemporal hemianopsia). It is with
hypothyroidism that hyperprolactinemia may occur. With primary
hypothyroidism, both TRH (secreted by the hypothalamus) and TSH
(secreted by anterior pituitary) levels are elevated. TRH acts as a
prolactin-releasing hormone in addition to being a thyroid-releasing
hormone. Chest wall trauma, and not abdominal wall trauma, can
cause hyperprolactinemia.

19.2

D. Elevated prolactin levels inhibit GnRH pulsations from the hypothalamus. Without the signal from GnRH, gonadotropins (FSH/LH)
are not released from the anterior pituitary and no estrogen (or progesterone) is released from the ovaries; this results in amenorrhea.
Pituitary adenomas impinge on the optic chiasm, causing deficits of
the peripheral vision (bitemporal hemianopsia) and not the central
visual field. The pituitary is located in the anterior half of the cerebrum; therefore an occipital cerebral defect is unlikely to be a clinical presentation relating to a pituitary adenoma. Diabetes insipidus
results from a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the
posterior pituitary, and would not be a clinical presentation consistent with an anterior pituitary tumor.

19.3

D. Oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) are posterior pituitary hormones. The other answer choices are released by the anterior pituitary. Whereas prolactin acts on the breast to produce milk,
oxytocin acts on the breast to stimulate ejection of the milk in a lactating woman. Oxytocin is also responsible for uterine contractions
during labor. The main function of FSH is to stimulate follicular
development and maturity in the ovaries. ADH acts on the kidney
to conserve water and is released when the body is dehydrated. TSH
causes release of thyroid hormones, T3 and T4, which are involved in
essential metabolic processes throughout the body.

19.4

C. Bromocriptine therapy is indicated during pregnancy if symptoms
(eg, headache or visual field abnormalities) arise. No studies have
shown bromocriptine to be unsafe to the developing fetus. A craniotomy and pituitary resection is a very high-risk surgery. It is typically reserved for patients with a macroadenoma, who have failed
medical treatment. Surgery would not be indicated for this patient
who has a microadenoma and has not attempted medical therapy.

CLINICAL CASES

173

Plus, any procedure that may induce hemorrhage in a patient would
be considered risky in pregnancy. Tamoxifen is not indicated because
it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in the
treatment of breast cancer. It therefore binds to estrogen receptors to
inhibit estrogen action, and does not affect the microadenoma or
prolactin production and action. A lumbar puncture would not be an
option for managing a prolactinoma, but might worsen the patient’s
headache. Expectant management would not be a good option
because a microadenoma can continue to grow during pregnancy
from hormonal influences. Therefore, the patient’s symptoms would
only worsen, and treatment should be initiated promptly.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Galactorrhea in the face of normal menses and a normal prolactin level
may be observed. The normal menses indicates normal hypothalamic
function.
➤ The first evaluation in a woman with oligomenorrhea and galactorrhea
should be a pregnancy test.
➤ Osteoporosis is a danger with hypoestrogenemia due to hyperprolactinemia.
➤ Hypothyroidism can lead to hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea.
➤ MRI is the most sensitive imaging test to assess pituitary adenomas.

ANSWER TO CASE 20:
Pruritus (Cholestasis) of Pregnancy
Summary: A 24-year-old G1 P0 at 28 weeks’ gestation complains of a 2-week
duration of generalized pruritus. She is anicteric and normotensive. The skin
is without rashes. The fetal heart tones are in the 140-bpm range.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Cholestasis of pregnancy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the differential diagnosis of pruritus in pregnancy.
2. Understand the clinical presentation of cholestasis of pregnancy.
3. Know that the first line of treatment of cholestasis of pregnancy is an oral
antihistamine.

Considerations
This 24-year-old woman, who is at 28 weeks’ gestational age, complains of generalized pruritus. The systemic location of the itching and lack of rash makes a
contact dermatitis unlikely. Another cause of pruritus unique to pregnancy is
pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), which are erythematous papules and hives beginning in the abdominal area and often
spreading to the buttocks. This is unlikely, as the patient does not have a rash.
This patient’s clinical picture does not resemble herpes gestationis, a condition
causing intense itching but associated with erythematous blisters on the
abdomen and extremities. Thus, the most likely etiology in this case is intrahepatic cholestasis, a process in which bile salts are incompletely cleared by
the liver, accumulate in the body, and are deposited in the dermis, causing pruritus. This disorder usually begins in the third trimester. There are no associated skin rashes, other than excoriations from patient scratching.

APPROACH TO
Pruritus in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
CHOLESTASIS IN PREGNANCY: Intrahepatic cholestasis of unknown etiol-

ogy in pregnancy whereby the patient usually complains of pruritus with or
without jaundice and no skin rash.
PRURITIC URTICARIAL PAPULES AND PLAQUES OF PREGNANCY
(PUPPP): A common skin condition of unknown etiology unique to preg-

nancy characterized by intense pruritus and erythematous papules on the
abdomen and extremities.
HERPES GESTATIONIS: Rare skin condition only seen in pregnancy; it is
characterized by intense itching and vesicles on the abdomen and extremities.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pruritus in pregnancy may be caused by many disorders, of which one of the
most common is intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, a condition that usually begins in the third trimester. It begins as mild pruritus without lesions, usually at night, and gradually increases in severity. The itching is usually more
severe on the extremities than on the trunk. It may recur in subsequent pregnancies and with the ingestion of oral contraceptives, suggesting a hormonerelated pathogenesis. The disease is common in some ethnic populations such
as Swedes, suggesting a genetic basis for the disease process. Increased levels
of circulating bile acids confirm the diagnosis. Elevated liver function tests
are uncommon and there are no hepatic sequelae in the mother. Cholestasis of
pregnancy must be distinguished from viral hepatitis and other causes of pruritus or liver disease. Cholestasis of pregnancy, especially when accompanied
by jaundice, is associated with an increased incidence of prematurity, fetal
distress, and fetal loss. There is also an increased incidence of gallstones associated with the pruritus of pregnancy. The first line of treatment has traditionally been antihistamines and cornstarch baths. Other treatments include the
bile salt binder, cholestyramine, but it has been associated with vitamin K deficiency. More recently, ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to decrease pruritus and seems to be better tolerated than cholestyramine.
Herpes gestationis, which has no relationship to herpes simplex virus, is a
pruritic bullous disease of the skin. It usually begins in the second trimester of
pregnancy and the reported incidence is less than 1 in 1000 pregnancies. The
etiology is thought to be autoimmune related. The presence of IgG autoantibody directed at the basement membrane has been demonstrated and may result
in activation of the classic complement pathway by autoantibodies directed

178

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

against the basement membrane zone. The clinical features are characterized
by intense pruritus followed by extensive patches of cutaneous erythema and
subsequent formation of small vesicles and tense bullae. The limbs are
affected more often than the trunk. Definitive diagnosis is made by immunofluorescent examination of biopsy specimens. There have been reports of an
increased incidence of fetal growth retardation and stillbirth. Transient
neonatal herpes gestationis has also been reported at birth. Treatment has primarily been the use of oral corticosteroids.
The lesions of PUPPP usually begin on the abdomen and spread to the thighs
and sometimes the buttocks and arms. The lesions, as their name describes, consist of erythematous urticarial plaques and small papules surrounded by a narrow,
pale halo. The incidence of PUPPP is less than 1% of pregnant women.
Immunofluorescent studies are negative for both IgG and complement.
Histologic findings consist of normal epidermis accompanied by a superficial
perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes associated with edema of
the papillary dermis. There are no studies to suggest an adverse effect on fetal and
maternal outcome. Therapy includes topical steroids and antihistamines.

A 33-year-old woman G1 P0 at 39 weeks’ gestation is in labor. She has
been diagnosed with herpes gestationis with the characteristic pruritus
and vesicular lesions on the abdomen. Which of the following precautions is best advised for this patient?
A. Cesarean delivery is indicated.
B. Neonatal lesions may be noted and will resolve.
C. Vaginal delivery is permissible if the lesions are not in the introitus region and provided that oral acyclovir is given to the baby.
D. Tocolysis and oral steroid use is advisable until the lesions are
healed.

ANSWERS
20.1

C. Intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy may be associated with
increased perinatal morbidity, especially when accompanied by jaundice. It is rare for liver enzymes to be elevated or for there to be any
hepatic sequelae in the mother; however, every patient who is suspected of having cholestasis of pregnancy should have their liver
enzymes checked to avoid fetal morbidity and mortality. Hepatic
enzyme levels are less than 3 U/L; women with intrahepatic cholestasis may have slightly elevated levels but almost never in the thousands. On presentation, no rash typically accompanies the pruritus.
Thrombocytopenia is not involved in this disorder; however it is
involved in a life-threatening condition of pregnancy known as
HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.

20.2

D. PUPPP is not thought to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis is made presumptively based on clinical presentation, with the rash almost always beginning with the abdominal
striae of the abdomen. They are usually small red “bumps” that are
intensely pruritic. The treatment is symptomatic. Interestingly, this
condition usually occurs with the first pregnancy and usually does not
recur, with the most common onset at 35 to 36 weeks’ gestation.

20.3

B. Neonatal lesions are sometimes seen with herpes gestationis caused
by the IgG antibodies crossing the placenta, and these lesions will
resolve. Herpes gestationis is not the same as herpes simplex virus. The
latter would necessitate cesarean delivery to avoid infection to the
baby.

Salpingitis, Acute
Summary: A 23-year-old G0 P0 nonpregnant woman complains of lower
abdominal tenderness, subjective fever, heavier menses than usual, and dyspareunia. Her temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C). The cervix is hyperemic, and
the uterus and adnexa are bilaterally exquisitely tender.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

➤

Long-term complications that can occur with this condition: Infertility or
ectopic pregnancy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the clinical diagnostic criteria of salpingitis.
2. Understand that the long-term complications of salpingitis are infertility,
ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain.
3. Know that one of the outpatient treatment regimens of salpingitis is intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline.

Considerations
This nulliparous woman has lower abdominal pain, adnexal tenderness, and
cervical motion tenderness. The presence of cervical motion tenderness is
indirect, based on the dyspareunia and hyperemic cervix. The patient also has
fever. These are the clinical criteria for pelvic inflammatory disease or salpingitis (infection of the fallopian tubes). Salpingitis is most commonly caused by
pathogenic bacteria of the endocervix that ascend to the tubes. The fallopian
tubes can become damaged by the infection, leading to tubal occlusion and
infertility or ectopic pregnancy. The pain occurs around the time of menses,
and ascending infection often occurs at the time of menses, during endometrial
breakdown. This patient has lower abdominal tenderness, which indicates
peritoneal irritation of the pelvis; generalized peritonitis such as involving the
entire peritoneal cavity may indicate a more extensive process, such as purulent material throughout the abdominal cavity, or another process. The differential diagnosis of salpingitis includes pyelonephritis, appendicitis,
cholecystitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, ovarian torsion, and gastroenteritis.

CLINICAL CASES

183

APPROACH TO
Salpingitis
DEFINITIONS
PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE: Synonymous with salpingitis, or infec-

tion of the fallopian tubes.
CERVICAL MOTION TENDERNESS: Extreme tenderness when the uterine
cervix is manipulated digitally, which suggests salpingitis.
ASCENDING INFECTION: Mechanism of upper genital tract infection
whereby the offending microorganisms arise from the lower genital tract.
TUBO-OVARIAN ABSCESS (TOA): Collection of purulent material around
the distal tube and ovary, which unlike the typical abscess is often treatable
by antibiotic therapy rather than requiring surgical drainage.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pelvic inflammatory disease, or salpingitis, usually involves Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other vaginal organisms, such as anaerobic bacteria. The mechanism is usually by ascending infection. A common presentation would be a
young, nulliparous female complaining of lower abdominal or pelvic pain and
vaginal discharge. The patient may also have fever, and nausea and vomiting
if the upper abdomen is involved. The cervix is inflamed and, therefore, the
patient often complains of dyspareunia.
The diagnosis of acute salpingitis is made clinically by abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and adnexal tenderness (Table 21–1).
Confirmatory tests may include a positive Neisseria gonorrhea or Chlamydia
culture, or an ultrasound suggesting a tubo-ovarian abscess. Other diseases
that must be considered are acute appendicitis, especially if the patient has
right-sided abdominal pain and ovarian torsion, which usually presents as colicky pain and is associated with an ovarian cyst on ultrasound. Renal disorders, such as pyelonephritis or nephrolithiasis, must also be considered. Right
upper quadrant pain may be seen with salpingitis when perihepatic adhesions
are present, the so-called Fitz-Hugh and Curtis syndrome. When the diagnosis is in doubt, the best method for confirmation is laparoscopy. The surgeon
would look for purulent discharge exuding from the fimbria of the tubes.
The treatment of acute salpingitis depends on whether the patient is a candidate for inpatient versus outpatient therapy. Criteria for outpatient management include low-grade fever, tolerance of oral medication, and the
absence of peritoneal signs. The woman must also be compliant. One regimen
consists of intramuscular ceftriaxone, as a single injection, and oral doxycycline twice a day for 10 to 14 days. Single agent quinolone therapy had gained

popularity previously, but recent evidence has shown increasing bacterial
resistance. It is paramount to reevaluate the patient in 48 hours for improvement. If the patient fails outpatient therapy, or is pregnant, or at the extremes
of age, or cannot tolerate oral medication, she would be a candidate for inpatient therapy. One such therapeutic combination is intravenous cefotetan and
oral or IV doxycycline. Again, if the patient does not improve within 48 to
72 hours, the clinician should consider laparoscopy to assess the disease.
One important sequelae of salpingitis is tubo-ovarian abscess. This disorder generally has anaerobic predominance and necessitates the corresponding
antibiotic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole). The physical examination may suggest an adnexal mass, or the ultrasound may reveal a complex
ovarian mass. A devastating complication of TOA is rupture, which is a surgical emergency and one that leads to mortality if unattended. In contrast to
most abscesses, TOAs can often be treated with antibiotic therapy without
surgical drainage; radiological percutaneous drainage may sometimes be used
to hasten resolution.
Long-term complications of salpingitis include chronic pelvic pain, involuntary infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. The risk of infertility due to tubal damage
is directly related to the number of episodes of PID. The intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) places the patient at greater risk for PID, whereas oral contraceptive agents (progestin thickens the cervical mucus) decrease the risk of PID.

A 24-year-old G0 P0 woman is seen at the local sexually transmitted
disease (STD) clinic. Chlamydia is discovered colonizing the endocervix. The patient is given oral azithromycin therapy and warned
about the dangers of upper genital tract infection, such as PID. The
physician notes that the patient is at risk for PID. Which of the following is a risk factor for developing PID?
A. Nulliparity
B. Candida vaginitis
C. Oral contraceptive agents
D. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate

21.4

A 33-year-old woman with an intrauterine contraceptive device
develops symptoms of acute salpingitis. On laparoscopy, sulfur granules appear at the fimbria of the tubes. Which of the following is the
most likely organism?
A. C trachomatis
B. Nocardia species
C. N gonorrhoeae
D. T pallidum
E. Actinomyces species

ANSWERS
21.1

A. Multiple organisms are most likely encountered in acute salpingitis.
N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis are the two most common organisms
involved. Other vaginal organisms, such as anaerobic bacteria, are
also usually involved in the mix. Peptostreptococci are anaerobic,
gram-negative bacteria that are natural part of human flora along the
gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary tracts. They are not involved in
salpingitis. Syphilis is not a common cause of salpingitis, although it
is an STD like Chlamydia and gonorrhea. In the first stage of syphilis,

186

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

chancres may appear on the external genitalia or along the vaginal
wall, but not in the endocervix as with Chlamydia and gonorrhea.
21.2

D. Laparoscopy is considered the “gold standard” for diagnosing salpingitis. The surgeon has direct visualization of the tubes with this
method, and looks for purulent discharge exuding from the fimbria
of the tubes. Clinical criteria and sonography are not specific enough
for this diagnosis. The clinical criteria that may support this diagnosis include: abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness,
adnexal tenderness, vaginal discharge, fever, and pelvic mass on
physical examination or ultrasound. A pelvic mass, such as a tuboovarian abscess, may be visualized using sonography; however, it
would still not specify the origin of the mass. Of the imaging tests,
CT scan is most helpful when appendicitis is suspected.

21.3

A. Nulliparity is associated with an increased risk of PID. IUD use
increases the risk of PID. The most typical way this occurs is during
the placement of the IUD, since it breaks the endocervical barrier as
it enters the uterus and can spread infection from the endocervix
into the tubes. Oral contraceptive agents, including depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, decrease the risk of PID by virtue of the progestin thickening the cervical mucus and thinning the endometrium.
Candida vaginitis is a fungal infection, commonly called a yeast infection, that manifests due to an overgrowth of naturally occurring vaginal flora; fungal infections are typically not involved in the
development of PID, and patients typically present with a chief complaint of severe itching and burning of the vagina with curd-like
vaginal discharge.

E. Sulfur granules are classic for Actinomyces, which occurs more
often in the presence of an IUD. Actinomyces israelii is a gram-positive
anaerobe, which is generally sensitive to penicillin. Chlamydia and
gonorrhea are the only other answer choices typically involved in
the development of acute salpingitis, however neither one of them
are associated with sulfur granules.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The organisms responsible for salpingitis are polymicrobial including
N gonorrhea, Chlamydia, anaerobes, and gram-negative rods.Therefore, the
antibiotic therapy must be broad spectrum.
➤ The classic clinical triad of PID is lower abdominal tenderness, cervical
motion tenderness, and adnexal tenderness.
➤ Laparoscopy is the “gold standard” in the diagnosis of acute salpingitis, by
the operator visualizing purulent drainage from the fallopian tubes.
➤ Long-term sequelae of acute salpingitis include chronic pelvic pain,
ectopic pregnancy, and involuntary infertility.

ANSWERS TO CASE 22:
Pulmonary Embolus in Pregnancy
Summary: A 19-year-old G1 P0 woman at 20 weeks’ gestation complains of
the acute onset of pleuritic chest pain and severe dyspnea. On examination,
her HR is 120 bpm and RR 40 breaths per minute. The lung examination
reveals clear lungs bilaterally. The oxygen saturation is low.
➤

Test most likely to lead to the diagnosis: Spiral computed tomography or
magnetic resonance angiography of the lungs.

➤

Concern: Pulmonary embolism.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that pleuritic chest pain and severe dyspnea are common presenting symptoms of pulmonary embolism.
2. Know that the pregnant woman is predisposed to deep venous thrombosis
due to venous obstruction and a hypercoagulable state.
3. Understand that the spiral CT or MR angiography scan is an initial diagnostic test for pulmonary embolism.

Considerations
This 19-year-old woman at 20 weeks’ gestation complains of the acute onset of
severe dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. The physical examination confirms the
respiratory distress due to the tachycardia and tachypnea. The lungs are clear on
auscultation, which rules out reactive airway disease or significant pneumonia.
The patient also does not complain of cough or fever, further making pneumonia unlikely. Clear lungs also speak against pulmonary edema. The patient has
significant hypoxia with oxygen saturation of 85%. Thus, the most likely diagnosis and concern is pulmonary embolism. Although many diagnostic tests
should be considered in the initial evaluation of a patient with respiratory distress (such as arterial blood gas, chest radiograph, electrocardiograph), in this
case a spiral (or helical) CT or MR angiography imaging procedure would likely
lead to the diagnosis. Previously ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans were recommended in pregnancy; however, recent evidence indicates that V/Q scan
exposes the fetus to slightly more radiation and is associated with a high rate of
indeterminate cases. If the imaging confirms pulmonary embolism, then the
patient should receive anticoagulation to help stabilize the deep venous thrombosis and decrease the likelihood of further embolization. Pregnancy causes

venous stasis due to the mechanical effect of the uterus on the vena cava; additionally, the high estrogen level induces a hypercoagulable state due to the
increase in clotting factors, particularly fibrinogen.

APPROACH TO
Respiratory Distress in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS: Blood clot involving the deep veins of the
lower extremity, rather than just the superficial involvement of the saphenous
system.
PULMONARY EMBOLUS: Blood clot that is lodged in the pulmonary arterial circulation, usually arising from a thrombus of the lower extremity or
pelvis.
HELICAL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCAN: High-resolution imaging
using IV contrast with multiple sectors to allow for three-dimensional analysis and examination for vascular filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature.
MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY: Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to assess for vascular defects by intravenous contrast.
VENTILATION-PERFUSION SCAN IMAGING PROCEDURE: Using a small
amount of intravenous, radioactively tagged albumin, such as technetium, in
conjunction with a ventilation imaging, with inhaled xenon or technetium, in
an effort to find large ventilation-perfusion mismatches suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Respiratory distress is an acute emergency and necessitates rapid assessment
and therapy. Oxygen is the most important substrate for the human body,
and even 5 or 10 minutes of hypoxemia can lead to devastating consequences.
Hence, a quick evaluation of the patient’s respiratory condition, including the
respiratory rate and effort; use of accessory muscles, such as intercostal and
supraclavicular muscles; anxiety; and cyanosis; may indicate mild or severe disease. (See Figure 22–1 for one algorithm to evaluate dyspnea in pregnancy).
The highest priority is to identify impending respiratory failure, since this
condition would require immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas studies should be ordered while information is gathered during the history and physical. A cursory and targeted
history directed at the pulmonary or cardiac organs, such as a history of reactive airway disease, exposure to anaphylactoid stimuli such as penicillin or bee

sting, chest trauma, cardiac valvular disease, chest pain, or palpitations, are
important. Meanwhile, the physical examination should be directed at the
heart and lung evaluation. The heart should be assessed for cardiomegaly and
valvular disorders, and the lungs should be auscultated for wheezes, rhonchi,
rales, or absent breath sounds. The abdomen, back, and skin should also be
examined.
A pulse oximetry reading of less than 90% corresponds to an oxygen tension of less than 60 mm Hg. Supplemental oxygen should immediately be
given. An arterial blood gas should be obtained to assess for hypoxemia, carbon
dioxide retention, and acid–base status. These findings should be evaluated in
the context of the physiological changes in pregnancy (see Table 22–1). A
chest radiograph should be performed rather expeditiously to differentiate cardiac versus pulmonary causes of hypoxemia. A large cardiac silhouette may
indicate peripartum cardiomyopathy, which is treated by diuretic and
inotropic therapy; pulmonary infiltrates may indicate pneumonia or pulmonary edema. A clear chest radiograph in the face of hypoxemia suggests

PARAMETER

COMMENT

pulmonary embolism, although early in the course of pneumonia, the chest xray may appear normal.
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism may be made presumptively on the
basis of the clinical presentation, hypoxemia on arterial blood gas analysis,
and a clear chest x-ray. Intravenous heparin may be initiated to stabilize the
deep venous thrombosis, which is usually located in the pelvis or lower
extremity. Previously ventilation-perfusion nuclear scans were used to diagnose pulmonary emboli; however, more recently, helical CT or MR angiography have emerged as accurate and involving very little radiation to the fetus.
Once the diagnosis of acute thromboembolism is confirmed, the pregnant
woman is usually placed on full intravenous anticoagulation therapy for 5 to
7 days. Later on, the therapy is generally switched to subcutaneous therapy to
maintain the aPTT at 1.5 to 2.5 times control for at least 3 months after the
acute event. Low-molecular-weight heparin can also be utilized; its advantages are less bleeding complications and less need for blood tests to assess
anticoagulation. After 3 months, either full heparinization or “prophylactic
heparinization” can be utilized for the remainder of the pregnancy and for
6 weeks postpartum. Newer imaging tests that are more sensitive for pulmonary
embolism include magnetic resonance angiography and spiral computed

tomographic evaluation. Usually, the pregnant woman is placed on prophylactic low-dose heparin for the remainder of pregnancy and up to 6 weeks
postpartum. Estrogen products, such as oral contraceptive agents, are relatively contraindicated. Prophylactic anticoagulation for future pregnancies is
more controversial, but often is used. Although pregnancy itself may induce
thrombosis, many experts advise obtaining tests for other causes of thrombosis such as protein S and protein C levels, antithrombin III activity, Factor
V Leiden mutation and hyperhomocysteinemia, and antiphospholipid syndrome or other thrombophilias.

B. The PCO2 level indicates significant retained PCO2 and a worrisome
respiratory failure.
C. The arterial blood gas is normal in pregnancy.
D. The serum bicarbonate level is elevated for pregnancy and indicates metabolic alkylosis.

ANSWERS
22.1

A. Dyspnea is the most common symptom of pulmonary embolus,
whereas tachypnea is the most common sign. Another common symptom is pleuritic chest pain. A person with a pulmonary embolus may also
experience palpitation or feel like they are having an anxiety attack and
few patients will have hemoptysis. However, these symptoms are not
nearly as common as dyspnea. Sudden death is uncommon, but is more

196

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

likely in a massive embolus. Patients with a preexisting heart or lung
condition are at increased risk of mortality. When a patient presents
with dyspnea, a focused examination and assessment of oxygenation
alert for the possibility of significant hypoxia.
22.2

B. Thromboembolism is the most common cause of maternal mortality. Pregnant women are predisposed to deep venous thromboses
due to the obstructive effects the growing uterus has on the great vessels
(ie, vena cava) and the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. The hypercoagulable state persists for about 6 weeks postpartum. Hemorrhage typically occurs postpartum, usually due to uterine atony. The readily
available blood products decreases the likelihood of death. Hypertensive
disease is not typically deadly at the time of diagnosis and can be medically managed before, during, and after pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies
are usually not deadly unless rupture occurs and the patient goes into
shock. Though this can occur, it is less common than embolism. Patients
usually present with early signs (ie, vaginal bleeding) and symptoms
(ie, adnexal pain) of an ectopic pregnancy before rupture occurs. Sepsis
can also send a patient into shock, however there are usually signs and
symptoms of a bacterial infection (ie, fever, chills, vomiting) that will
prompt a patient to see their doctor before there is progression to shock.

22.3

A. Although an S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and right-axis
deviation may be seen, tachycardia is the most common EKG abnormality associated with pulmonary embolism. These findings typically
result from the strain placed on the right side of the heart as it attempts
to pump blood to the pulmonary vasculature against increased resistance due to the embolus. These EKG findings are not very specific for
a pulmonary embolus. In other words, a normal EKG does not rule out
pulmonary embolism.

22.4

C. Early ambulation in general is the most important method of preventing deep venous thrombosis after cesarean delivery. DepoProvera, unlike estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, is a
progestin and is not a major cause of a DVT. Bed rest will increase the
risk of this patient for developing a DVT. Intravenous heparin is not
indicated in a prophylactic regimen but rather is given in this manner in full anticoagulation. Some practitioners will place women, who
have undergone cesarean, on sequential compression devices or prophylactic subcutaneous heparin (or low-molecular-weight heparin).

22.5

C. This arterial blood gas is normal in a pregnant woman. Pregnancy
induces a respiratory alkylosis with partial metabolic compensation.
This is the reason the serum bicarbonate level is decreased as compared to the nonpregnant patient.

CLINICAL CASES

22.6

197

B.This arterial blood gas reveals a PCO2 of 35 mm Hg, which is elevated. In the face of reactive airway disease, this retained PCO2 is
worrisome, and may indicate respiratory failure. Initially, with
asthma, hyperventilation should be associated with a decreased
PCO2. When the PCO2 increases, fatigue, ineffective ventilation, or
respiratory failure are possibilities.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected in a patient with dyspnea, a clear chest radiograph, and hypoxemia. It is confirmed with imaging tests such as ventilation-perfusion scan or spiral CT scan.
➤ The most common presenting symptom of pulmonary embolism is dyspnea.
➤ The most common cause of maternal mortality is embolism (both thromboembolism and amniotic fluid embolism).
➤ A PO2 of less than 80 mm Hg in a pregnant woman is abnormal.
➤ Anticoagulation is the best treatment of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

ANSWERS TO CASE 23:
Herpes Simplex Virus Infection in Labor
Summary: A 31-year-old G3 P2 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation is in labor and
her membranes ruptured 2 hours ago. She has a history of herpes simplex virus
(HSV) infections and is taking oral acyclovir suppressive therapy. She has a
1-day history of tingling in the perineal area.
➤

Next step: Counsel patient about risks of neonatal HSV infection and offer
a cesarean delivery.

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Herpes simplex virus recurrence with prodromal
symptoms.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the indications for cesarean delivery due to herpes simplex
virus infection in pregnancy.
2. Know that herpes simplex virus may cause neonatal encephalitis.
3. Understand that symptoms of prodromal infection may indicate viral
shedding.

Considerations
The patient is in labor and has experienced rupture of membranes. She has a
history of herpes simplex virus infections. Although she has no lesions visible
and is taking acyclovir suppressive therapy, she complains of tingling of the
perineal region. These symptoms are sufficient to suggest an HSV outbreak.
With herpes simplex virus shedding of the genital tract, there is risk of neonatal infection, especially encephalitis, which can lead to severe permanent CNS
compromise. The patient should be counseled about the neonatal risks, and
offered cesarean delivery to decrease the risk of neonatal exposure to the HSV.

APPROACH TO
Herpes Simplex Virus in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PRODROMAL SYMPTOMS: Prior to the outbreak
of the classic vesicles, the patient may complain of burning, itching, or tingling.

CLINICAL CASES

201

NEONATAL HERPES INFECTION: HSV can cause disseminated infection

with major organ involvement; be confined to encephalitis, eyes, skin, or
mucosa; or be asymptomatic. The vast majority of neonatal herpes infections
occur via exposure to virus in fluids and secretions of the genital tract,
although 5% to 10% may occur in the antepartum period transplacentally.
This is most likely due to primary episodes and significant viremia.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Herpes cultures or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are not useful in the acute
management of pregnant women who present in labor or with rupture of membranes. They are helpful in making the diagnosis during the prenatal course,
when the patient may develop lesions and the diagnosis is in question. Once a
woman has been diagnosed with herpes simplex virus, the practitioner uses his
or her best clinical judgment to assess for the presence of HSV in the genital
tract during the time of labor. A meticulous inspection of the external genitalia, vagina, cervix (including by speculum examination), and perianal area
should be undertaken for the typical herpetic lesions, such as vesicles or ulcers
(Figure 23–1). Additionally, the patient should be queried thoroughly about the
presence of prodromal symptoms. When there are no lesions or prodromal symptoms, the patient should be counseled that she is at low risk for viral shedding
and likely has a small but possible risk of neonatal herpes infection. Usually, the
patient will opt for vaginal delivery under these circumstances. In contrast, the
presence of prodromal symptoms or genital lesions suspicious for HSV is sufficient to warrant a recommendation for cesarean delivery to prevent neonatal infection.
Acyclovir has activity against both HSV-1 and HSV-2. In a primary herpes outbreak, oral acyclovir reduces viral shedding, pain symptoms, and is
associated with faster healing of the lesions. Newer medications such as valacyclovir or famciclovir require less frequent dosing due to their increased
bioavailability, but are more expensive. The use of suppressive acyclovir therapy is usually reserved for frequent outbreaks. Some practitioners advocate the
use of oral suppressive acyclovir when the woman has her first episode of HSV
infection during pregnancy. This therapy may decrease the symptoms during
the time of labor, and decrease the need for cesarean delivery.

Comprehension Questions
23.1

A 32-year-old woman G1 P0 at 24 weeks’ gestation is seen by her obstetrician for painful vesicles on the vulva. PCR is performed and returns
as HSV-2. The obstetrician counsels the patient about the possibility of
needing cesarean when she goes into labor. Which of the following is an
indication for cesarean section due to maternal herpes simplex virus?
A. Vesicular lesions noted on the cervix
B. History of lesions noted on the vagina 1 month previously, now
not visible
C. Lesions noted on the posterior thigh
D. Tingling of the chest wall with lesions consistent with herpes
zoster

23.2

A 29-year-old G2 P1 woman is seen in the office for her pregnancy at
16 weeks’ gestation. She complains of some burning of the vulvar area.
Two blisters are noted on the labia majora. PCR is performed on the
lesions, which returns as HSV-1. Which of the following statements is
most accurate in the counseling of this patient?
A. Because this result is HSV-1, the finding is likely a false-positive
result and the patient does not likely have a herpes infection.
B. Because of the finding of HSV-1, the neonate is not at risk for herpes encephalitis.
C. The patient should be treated the same whether the infection is
HSV-1 or HSV-2.
D. The patient likely has an HIV infection since HSV-1 was isolated
in the vulvar area.

rationale for the acyclovir therapy?
A. Decrease the likelihood of recurrence and need for cesarean
B. Decrease the likelihood of transplacental transmission to the fetus
C. Decrease the duration of viral shedding and duration of the current infection
D. Increase the patient’ immunity and IgG levels to HSV

A 34-year-old woman is seen at her internist’s office complaining of
vulvar pain. On examination, three ulcers are noted on the right labia
majora. The lesions have ragged edges, a necrotic base, and there is
adenopathy noted on the right inguinal region. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Syphilis
B. Herpes simplex virus
C. Chancroid
D. Squamous cell carcinoma
E. Bartholin gland abscess

ANSWERS
23.1

A. The presence of prodromal symptoms or lesions along the genital
tract (ie, cervix) suspicious for HSV is sufficient to warrant a
cesarean delivery to prevent neonatal infection. When there are no
lesions or prodromal symptoms, the patient should be counseled that
she is at low risk for viral shedding and has an unknown risk of
neonatal herpes infection; typically the patient will opt for vaginal
delivery. The posterior thigh is unlikely to inoculate the baby during
delivery, and is not an indication for cesarean delivery. Lesions on
the chest wall consistent with herpes zoster would not necessitate
cesarean delivery; however, the baby should still not come in contact
with these lesions and breast-feeding should be avoided. Herpes
zoster infection in a neonate can have fatal consequences.

23.2

C. Although usually HSV-1 is found above the waist and HSV-2
below the waist, there are often exceptions. PCR is highly sensitive
and specific, and it is unlikely that the viral subtype is erroneous.
HSV-1 can also cause neonatal encephalitis, and the patient should
be counseled and treated the same as if HSV-2 were isolated. A finding of HSV-1 in the vulvar region does not suggest HIV infection;
nevertheless, the patient should have screening for sexually transmitted infections.

23.3

C. The rationale for oral acyclovir therapy at the primary outbreak is
to decrease viral shedding and the duration of infection. The acyclovir does not affect the likelihood of future recurrence and does
not change the patient’s immune response. There is no evidence that
oral acyclovir alters transplacental transmission to the fetus,
although reducing the viremia may help.

23.4

C. Chancroid is a rare cause of infectious vulvar ulcers in the United
States, although worldwide it is quite common; thus, cases occurring
in America are related to ports of entry. HSV is the most common
cause of infectious vulvar ulcers in the United States, and individuals

CLINICAL CASES

205

are typically infected with the HSV-2 virus that is sexually transmitted. Genital herpes can cause recurrent painful genital sores, and
herpes infection can become severe in people who are immunosuppressed. Syphilis typically presents during the first stage of the disease as a small, round, and painless chancre in the area of the body
exposed to the spirochete. Chancroid is an STD caused by the gramnegative bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi, and like HSV, is characterized by painful genital lesions. The Bartholin glands, responsible for
vaginal secretions, are located at the entrance of the vagina; they
may enlarge into painless abscesses when they become clogged and
infected. Vulvar carcinoma typically is nontender, ulcerative, and is
more common in postmenopausal women.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Cesarean delivery should be offered to a woman with a history of HSV who
has prodromal symptoms or suspicious lesions of the genital tract.
➤ Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of infectious vulvar ulcers
in the United States.
➤ Most neonatal herpes infections occur from HSV from genital tract secretions and fluids, although 5% to 10% of neonatal infections are acquired in
utero. These are usually due to primary episodes.
➤ The cervix, vagina, and vulva must be inspected carefully for lesions in a
patient in labor with a history of herpes simplex virus.
➤ Acyclovir and analogous agents given in pregnancy during primary episodes
can decrease the duration of viral shedding and duration of lesions.
➤ Acyclovir suppression, when a primary HSV infection occurs in pregnancy,
can decrease the likelihood of recurrence and need for cesarean.

She states that several years ago a doctor had told her that her uterus
was enlarged. Her records indicate that 1 year ago she underwent a uterine dilation and curettage, with the tissue showing benign pathology.
She denies fatigue, cold intolerance, or galactorrhea. She takes ibuprofen without relief of her vaginal bleeding. On examination, her blood
pressure (BP) is 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) 80 beats per minute
(bpm), weight 140 lb, and temperature is 98°F (36.6°C). The heart and
lung examinations are normal. The abdomen reveals a lower abdominal
midline irregular mass. On pelvic examination, the cervix is anteriorly
displaced. An irregular midline mass approximately 18 weeks’ size seems
to move in conjunction with the cervix. No adnexal masses are palpated. Her pregnancy test is negative. Her hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL,
leukocyte count is 6,000/mm3, and platelet count is 160,000/mm3.

ANSWERS TO CASE 24:
Uterine Leiomyomata
Summary: A 40-year-old G5 P5 woman with a history of an enlarged uterus
complains of menorrhagia and anemia despite ibuprofen. A prior uterine dilation and curettage showed benign pathology. Examination reveals an irregular midline mass approximately 18 weeks’ size that is seemingly contiguous
with the cervix and there is an anteriorly displaced cervix.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Symptomatic uterine leiomyomata.

➤

Next step: Offer the patient hysterectomy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that the most common reason for hysterectomy in the United
States is symptomatic uterine fibroids.
2. Know that hysterectomy is generally reserved for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids that are refractory to an adequate trial of medical
therapy.
3. Know that menorrhagia is the most common symptom of uterine leiomyomata.

Considerations
This 40-year-old woman complains of menorrhagia. The physical examination is consistent with uterine fibroids, because of the enlarged midline mass
that is irregular and contiguous with the cervix. If the mass were lateral or
moved apart from the cervix, another type of pelvic mass, such as ovarian,
would be suspected. This patient complains of menorrhagia (excessive bleeding during menses), which is the most common symptom of uterine fibroids.
If she had intermenstrual bleeding, the clinician would have to consider other
diseases, such as endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyp, or uterine cancer, in addition to the uterine leiomyomata. Irregular cycles (menometrorrhagia)
may suggest an anovulatory process. The patient has anemia despite medical
therapy, which constitutes the indication for intervention, such as hysterectomy. If the uterus were smaller, consideration may be given toward another
medical agent, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). Also, a
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist can be used to shrink the
fibroids temporarily, to correct the anemia, or make the surgery easier. The
maximum shrinkage of fibroids is usually seen after 3 months of GnRH agonist therapy. After the GnRH agonist is stopped, the fibroids would regrow.

DEFINITIONS
LEIOMYOMATA: Benign, smooth muscle tumors, usually of the uterus.
LEIOMYOSARCOMA: Malignant, smooth muscle tumor, with numerous mitoses.
SUBMUCOUS FIBROID: Leiomyomata that are primarily on the endometrial

side of the uterus and impinge on the uterine cavity (Figure 24–1).
INTRAMURAL FIBROID: Leiomyomata that are primarily in the uterine
muscle.
SUBSEROSAL FIBROID: Leiomyomata that are primarily on the outside of
the uterus, on the serosal surface. Physical examination may reveal a “knobby”
sensation.
PEDUNCULATED FIBROID: Leiomyoma that is on a stalk.
CARNEOUS DEGENERATION: Changes of the leiomyomata due to rapid
growth; the center of the fibroid becomes red, causing pain. This is synonymous with red degeneration.

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

CLINICAL APPROACH
Uterine leiomyomata are the most common tumors of the pelvis and the leading indication for hysterectomy in the United States. They occur in up to
25% of women, and have a variety of clinical presentations. The most common clinical manifestation is menorrhagia, or excessive bleeding during
menses. The exact mechanism is unclear and may be due to an increased
endometrial surface area or the disruption of hemostatic mechanisms during menses by the fibroids. Another speculated explanation is ulceration of
the submucosal fibroid surfaces.
Many uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and only need to be monitored.
Very rarely, uterine leiomyomata degenerate into leiomyosarcoma. Some signs
of this process include rapid growth, such as an increase of more than 6 weeks’
gestational size in 1 year. A history of radiation to the pelvis is a risk factor.
If the uterine leiomyomata are sufficiently large, patients may also complain of pressure to the pelvis, bladder, or rectum. Rarely, the uterine fibroid
on a pedicle may twist, leading to necrosis and pain. Also, a submucous
leiomyomata can prolapse through the cervix, leading to labor-like uterine
contraction pain.
The physical examination typical of uterine leiomyomata is an irregular,
midline, firm, nontender mass that moves contiguously with the cervix. This
presentation is approximately 95% accurate. Most of the time, ultrasound
examination is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Lateral, fixed, or fluctuant
masses are not typical for fibroids. The differential diagnosis includes ovarian
masses, tubo-ovarian masses, pelvic kidney, and endometrioma.
The initial treatment of uterine fibroids is medical, such as with nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents or progestin therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists lead to a decrease in uterine fibroid size, reaching its maximal
effect in 3 months. After the discontinuation of this agent, the leiomyomata
usually regrow to the pretreatment size. Thus, GnRH agonist therapy is reserved
for tumor shrinkage or correction of anemia prior to operative treatment.
Hysterectomy is considered the proven treatment for symptomatic uterine
fibroids when future pregnancy is undesired. Uterine artery embolization is a
technique performed by cannulizing the femoral artery and catheterizing both
uterine arteries directly, and infusing embolization particles that preferentially
float to the fibroid vessels. Fibroid infarction and subsequent hyalinization and
fibrosis result. Although short-term results appear promising, long-term data
does not yet exist. Myomectomy is still considered the procedure of choice for
women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata who desire pregnancy. The
indication for surgery is persistent symptoms despite medical therapy.
Significant menorrhagia often leads to anemia.

A 65-year-old woman is noted to have suspected uterine fibroids on
physical examination. Over the course of 1 year, she is noted to have
enlargement of her uterus from approximately 12 weeks’ size to 20 weeks’
size. Which of the following is the best management?
A. Continued careful observation
B. Monitoring with ultrasound examinations
C. Exploratory laparotomy with hysterectomy
D. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist
E. Progestin therapy

ANSWERS
24.1

A. Submucous fibroids are the fibroids most likely to be associated
with recurrent abortion because of their effect on the uterine cavity.
The contours of the endometrium are altered and therefore, less
favorable for implantation. There may be insufficient vasculature to
provide adequate blood supply to the growing embryo if it were to
implant along the side of the endometrium containing a submucosal
fibroid. In the second trimester of pregnancy, the other answer
choices are not associated with an increased risk of recurrent abortion because they do not alter the integrity of the endometrium.

24.2

B. Menorrhagia is the most common symptom of uterine fibroids,
and severe menorrhagia often leads to anemia. Infertility and recurrent abortion may occur with submucosal fibroids due to the effects
on the uterine cavity, whereas impingement on the ureters is most
likely to occur with subserosal fibroids, but these are much less common than menorrhagia. Pelvic pain is not very common, and many
uterine fibroids are asymptomatic and only require monitoring. If the
uterine leiomyomata are large enough, patients may complain of
pressure to the pelvis, bladder, or rectum. Though rare, a uterine
fibroid on a pedicle may twist, leading to necrosis and severe pain.

24.3

C. Extensive myomectomies sometimes necessitate cesarean delivery
because of the risk of uterine rupture. Most practitioners use the rule
of thumb that if the endometrial cavity is entered during myomectomy, a cesarean delivery should be performed with pregnancy. As
with uterine rupture, fetal bradycardia may also occur if the umbilical
cord becomes prolapsed, but cord prolapse is not a risk factor from
having a myomectomy. A submucosal myomata is related to problems
with fertility and implantation of the embryo, not problems during
labor such as uterine rupture. Placental abruption is not associated
with fetal bradycardia or as a risk after myomectomy. Myomectomies
do not cause congenital anomalies or disease processes to occur in a
developing fetus.

CLINICAL CASES

24.4

213

C. The rapid growth of the uterus suggests leiomyosarcoma; the diagnosis and treatment are surgical, especially in a woman of non–childbearing
age. Also, substantial growth of uterine fibroids in postmenopausal
women is unusual due to the lower estrogen levels. In other words,
uterine fibroids typically grow in response to estrogen. Once a fibroid
degenerates into cancer, progestin therapy and gonadotropin-releasing
hormone agonist have no more effect on the tumor and are no longer
treatment options for shrinking the mass.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common reason for hysterectomy is symptomatic uterine
fibroids.
➤ The most common symptom of uterine fibroids is menorrhagia.
➤ The physical examination consistent with uterine leiomyomata is an irregular pelvic mass that is mobile, midline, and moves contiguously with the
cervix.
➤ Leiomyosarcoma rarely arises from leiomyoma; rapid growth or a history of
prior pelvic irradiation should raise the index of suspicion.
➤ Significant growth in suspected uterine fibroids in a postmenopausal
woman is unusual and generally requires surgical evaluation.
➤ Asymptomatic uterine fibroids require surgical intervention in the presence of unexplained rapid growth, ureteral obstruction, or the inability to
differentiate the fibroid from other types of pelvic masses.

ANSWERS TO CASE 25:
Preeclampsia and Hepatic Rupture
Summary: A 19-year-old G1 P0 woman who delivered at 29 weeks’ gestation
is noted to have severe preeclampsia, epigastric tenderness, and markedly elevated liver function tests. Shortly after delivery, she develops sudden, severe
abdominal pain, abdominal distension, syncope, hypotension, and tachycardia.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Hepatic rupture.

➤

Next step: Emergent exploratory laparotomy and blood product replacement.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical presentation of preeclampsia.
2. Know the serious sequelae of severe preeclampsia, including hepatic rupture.
3. Understand that immediate laparotomy and massive blood product
replacement are important in the management of hepatic rupture.

Considerations
The patient is nulliparous, which is a risk factor for preeclampsia. She has severe
preeclampsia based on blood pressure criteria, proteinuria, epigastric tenderness,
and elevated liver function tests. The epigastric tenderness occurs because of
the ischemia to the liver. Rarely, a hepatic hematoma may form, and if rupture
of the hematoma occurs, catastrophic hemorrhage can ensue, leading to rapid
exsanguination if immediate exploratory laparotomy is not undertaken.

APPROACH TO
Preeclampsia
DEFINITIONS
CHRONIC HYPERTENSION: Blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg before preg-

nancy or at less than 20 weeks’ gestation.
GESTATIONAL HYPERTENSION: Hypertension without proteinuria at greater
than 20 weeks’ gestation.

CLINICAL CASES

217

PREECLAMPSIA: Hypertension with proteinuria (> 300 mg over 24 hour) at
a gestational age greater than 20 weeks, caused by vasospasm.
ECLAMPSIA: Seizure disorder associated with preeclampsia.
SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA: Vasospasm associated with preeclampsia of such
extent that maternal end organs are threatened, usually necessitating delivery
of the baby regardless of gestational age.
SUPERIMPOSED PREECLAMPSIA: Development of preeclampsia in a patient
with chronic hypertension.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hypertensive disorders complicate 3% to 4% of pregnancies and can be
organized into several categories: gestational hypertension, mild and severe
preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, and eclampsia. Gestational hypertensive patients have only increased blood pressures
without proteinuria. Chronic hypertension includes preexisting hypertension
or hypertension that develops prior to 20 weeks’ gestation. A patient with
chronic hypertension is at risk for developing preeclampsia and, if this develops, her diagnosis is labeled superimposed preeclampsia. Eclampsia occurs
when the patient with preeclampsia develops convulsions or seizures.
Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. Although
not a criterion, nondependent edema is also usually present. An elevated blood
pressure is diagnosed with a systolic blood pressure at or higher than 140 mm Hg
or diastolic blood pressure at or higher than 90 mm Hg. Two elevated BPs,
measured 6 hours apart (BP taken in the seated position), are needed for the
diagnosis of preeclampsia. Proteinuria is usually based on a timed urine collection, defined as equal to or greater than 300 mg of protein in 24 hours. Facial
and hand edema would be considered nondependent edema.
Preeclampsia is further categorized into mild and severe. Severe disease is diagnosed with a systolic BP at or higher than 160 mm Hg, diastolic BP of 110 mm Hg
or higher, or a 24-hour urine protein level of more than 5 g. If there is no time
for a 24-hour urine protein collection (ie, while in labor), a urine dipstick
helps estimate proteinuria, with 3+ to 4+ consistent with severe disease and
1+ to 2+ with mild disease. Patients may also be diagnosed with severe disease
when symptoms of preeclampsia, such as headache, right upper quadrant or
epigastric pain, and vision changes, occur.
The underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia is vasospasm and
“leaky vessels,” but its origin is unclear. It is cured only by termination of the
pregnancy, and the disease process almost always resolves after delivery.
Vasospasm and endothelial damage result in leakage of serum between the
endothelial cells and cause local hypoxemia of tissue. Hypoxemia leads to
hemolysis, necrosis, and other end-organ damage. Patients are usually unaware
of the hypertension and proteinuria, and typically the presence of symptoms
indicates severe disease. Hence, one of the important roles of prenatal care is

218

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

to identify patients with hypertension and proteinuria prior to severe disease.
Complications of preeclampsia include placenta abruption, eclampsia (with
possible intracerebral hemorrhage), coagulopathies, renal failure, hepatic subcapsular hematoma, hepatic rupture, and uteroplacental insufficiency.
Risk factors for preeclampsia include: nulliparity, extremes of age, AfricanAmerican race, personal history of severe preeclampsia, family history of
preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, antiphospholipid
syndrome, diabetes, and multifetal gestation. The history and physical examination is focused on end-organ disease (Table 25–1).
It is important to review and evaluate the blood pressures prior to 20 weeks’
gestation (to assess for chronic hypertension), evaluate proteinuria, and to
document any sudden increase in weight (indicating possible edema). On
physical examination serial blood pressures should be checked along with a
urinalysis.
Laboratory tests should include a complete blood count (CBC; check
platelet count and hemoconcentration), urinalysis and 24-hour urine protein

collection if possible (check for proteinuria), liver function tests, LDH (elevated with hemolysis), and uric acid test (usually increased with preeclampsia). Fetal testing (such as biophysical profile) can also be performed to
evaluate uteroplacental insufficiency.
After the diagnosis of preeclampsia is made, the management will depend on
the gestational age of the fetus and the severity of the disease (see Figure 25–1
for one management scheme). Delivery is the definitive treatment and the
risks of preeclampsia must be weighed against the risk of prematurity. When
the pregnancy reaches term, delivery is indicated. When the fetus is premature, severity of the disease needs to be assessed. When severe preeclampsia is
diagnosed, delivery is usually indicated regardless of gestational age. In
preterm patients, mild preeclampsia can be monitored closely for worsening
disease until the risk of prematurity has decreased.
Eclampsia is one of the most feared complications of preeclampsia and the
greatest risk for occurrence is just prior to delivery, during labor (intrapartum),
and within the first 24 hours postpartum. During labor, the preeclamptic
patient should be started on the anticonvulsant magnesium sulfate. Since
magnesium is excreted by the kidneys, it is important to monitor urine output, respiratory depression, dyspnea (side effect of magnesium sulfate is pulmonary edema), and abolition of the deep tendon reflexes (first sign of toxic
effects is hyporeflexia). Hypertension is not affected by the magnesium, but is

used to prevent seizures. Severe hypertension needs to be controlled with
antihypertensive medications such as hydralazine or labetalol. After delivery,
magnesium sulfate is discontinued approximately 24 hours postpartum. The
hypertension and proteinuria frequently will resolve. Occasionally, the
patient’s blood pressure remains high and an antihypertensive medication is
needed after delivery. After discharge, the patient usually follows up in 1 to
2 weeks to check blood pressures and proteinuria.

A 33-year-old woman at 29 weeks’ gestation is noted to have blood

function tests were normal. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?
A. Induction of labor
B. Cesarean section
C. Antihypertensive therapy
D. Expectant management

ANSWERS
25.1

B. Severe preeclampsia is associated with a 24-hour urine protein
level greater than 5 g; the reason for this is that such severe proteinuria is indicative of widespread and significant renal damage, and if
allowed to continue, renal insufficiency may ensue. Other criteria for
severe preeclampsia include: blood pressure exceeding 160/110 mm Hg,
severe headache, right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, and vision
changes. Pedal edema is not pathologic; nondependent edema, such
as of the face and hands, may be consistent with preeclampsia but
does not indicate severity of disease. Low platelets are associated with
HELLP syndrome, a form of hemolytic anemia in pregnancy, and are
very worrisome. Uric acid levels are known to be elevated with
preeclampsia; however, it is not a criterion for severe preeclampsia. In
general, the criteria for severe preeclampsia indicate end-organ
threat, and generally require delivery even at a preterm gestation.

25.2

C. Although the pregnancy is only 28 weeks, in light of the severe
preeclampsia, the best treatment is delivery. When severe preeclampsia is diagnosed, delivery usually is indicated regardless of gestational
age. Therefore, none of the other answer choices would be indicated
because no type of therapy other than delivery will resolve the
patient’s severe preeclampsia. Oral antihypertensive therapy, such as
labetalol, may be given to the patient to control blood pressure, however should not be used as the “treatment” of severe preeclampsia.
The platelet levels are not low enough to require transfusion; intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) is used for various autoimmune diseases, but not indicated in this patient.

25.3

A. The most common cause of maternal death due to eclampsia is
intracerebral hemorrhage. Eclampsia is one of the most feared complications of preeclampsia, and the greatest risk for occurrence is just
prior to delivery, during labor (intrapartum), and within the first
24 hours postpartum. During labor, the patient should be started on
the anticonvulsant magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis.
Magnesium sulfate has been proven to be superior to other anticonvulsants such as valium, dilantin, or phenobarbital. One dictum that

222

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

is useful in the emergency room or obstetrical unit is that “a pregnant
patient greater than 20 weeks’ gestation without a history of epilepsy
who presents with seizures has eclampsia until otherwise proven.”
25.4

D. In the preterm patient with mild preeclampsia, expectant management is generally employed until severe criteria are noted or the
pregnancy reaches term. In other words, the risks of prematurity usually outweigh the risks of the preeclampsia until end-organ threat is
manifest. Had this patient been at term, the best step in management
would be to place her on magnesium sulfate and induce labor; this is
because at term, the risks of prematurity are minimal. Severe, but not
mild hypertension associated with preeclampsia, should be controlled with hypertensive medication. Antihypertensive agents are
useful in chronic hypertension but not preeclampsia unless the BP is
in the severe range; lowering these BPs can help avoid stroke. For the
patient in this scenario, neither induction nor Cesarean section is
indicated since she is not yet at term. It is not a requirement for a
preeclamptic patient to deliver by Cesarean.

Clinical Pearls
➤ In general, the treatment of preeclampsia at term is magnesium sulfate
and delivery.
➤ The management of preeclampsia in a preterm pregnancy is observation
until severe criteria are noted, or term gestation is reached.
➤ The most common cause of significant proteinuria in pregnancy is
preeclampsia.
➤ Magnesium sulfate is the best anticonvulsant to prevent eclampsia.
➤ The first sign of magnesium toxicity is loss of deep tendon reflexes.
➤ Chronic hypertension is diagnosed when a pregnant woman has hypertension prior to 20 weeks’ gestation, or if the hypertension persists beyond
12 weeks postpartum.

ANSWERS TO CASE 26:
Fibroadenoma of the Breast
Summary: A 22-year-old woman is noted to have a 1-cm breast mass on routine physical examination. Palpation of her right breast reveals a firm, mobile,
nontender, rubbery 1-cm mass in the upper outer quadrant. No adenopathy is
noted.
➤

Next step: Biopsy of the mass (fine needle biopsy or core needle biopsy).

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Fibroadenoma of the breast.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that any three-dimensional dominant mass needs a biopsy.
2. Know the characteristic presentation of fibroadenomas of the breast.
3. Understand that the greater the risk of breast cancer, the more tissue that
is needed for biopsy.

Considerations
This woman comes in for a health maintenance examination; the approach is
generally immunizations, cancer screening, and assessment and prevention for
common diseases. On the physical examination, she is found to have a dominant breast mass. The firm, nontender, rubbery description is classic for a
fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas, as opposed to fibrocystic changes, do not change
with the menstrual cycle. Although the most likely etiology is a fibroadenoma,
this diagnosis needs to be confirmed by biopsy. The three methods of biopsy
include fine needle aspiration (FNA), core needle stereotactic biopsy, and excisional biopsy. Both core needle and excisional biopsy remove more tissue but are
more prone to bruising and pain; in this case, FNA is acceptable since the
patient is at low risk for breast cancer. She has no family history of breast cancer, is of a young age, and her examination does not contain any worrisome features of breast cancer. If the mass were fixed, or if there were nipple retraction
or bloody nipple discharge, the better method of biopsy would be excisional
biopsy to remove the entire mass for histologic analysis.

APPROACH TO
Breast Masses
DEFINITIONS
CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY: A 14- to 16-gauge needle used to extract tissue from
a breast mass, which preserves cellular architecture.
FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION (FNA): The use of a small-gauge needle with
associated vacuum via a syringe to aspirate fluid or some cells from a breast
mass and/or cyst. The histology from the FNA would be loose cells (cytology).
FIBROADENOMA: Benign, smooth muscle tumor of the breast, usually
occurring in young women.
EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: Surgical procedure to remove the entire lesion.

CLINICAL APPROACH
One of the key skills of any primary care physician is differentiating normal
breast changes from abnormal ones, that is, identification of the dominant
breast mass. Fibrocystic changes, the most common of the benign breast conditions, are described as multiple, irregular, “lumpiness of the breast.” It is not
a disease per se, but rather an exaggerated response to ovarian hormones.
Fibrocystic changes are very common in premenopausal women, but rare following menopause. The clinical presentation is cyclic, painful, engorged
breasts, more pronounced just before menstruation, and occasionally associated
with serous or green breast discharge. Through careful physical examination,
fibrocystic changes can usually be differentiated from the three-dimensional
dominant mass suggestive of cancer, but occasionally a fine-needle or core
biopsy must be performed to establish the diagnosis. Treatment includes
decreasing caffeine ingestion, and adding NSAIDs, a tight-fitting bra, oral contraceptives, or oral progestin therapy. With severe cases, danazol (a weak antiestrogen and androgenic compound) or even mastectomy are considered.
In a woman in the adolescent years or in her 20s, the most common cause
of a dominant breast mass is a fibroadenoma. These tumors are firm, rubbery,
mobile, and solid in consistency. They typically do not respond to ovarian
hormones and do not vary during the menstrual cycle. Since any threedimensional dominant mass necessitates histologic confirmation, a biopsy
should be performed. In a woman less than age 35 years, a fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy is often chosen. The advantages of FNA are less
expense, less pain, but higher nondiagnostic rate; advantages of core needle
biopsy include higher sensitivity but higher cost. The concept of the triple
assessment, that is, clinical examination, imaging (ultrasound or mammography),

226

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

and histology being concordant (all in agreement) has high reliability with
either FNA or core needle biopsy. Nonconcordance usually indicates obtaining more tissue. If the histologic examination supports fibroadenoma (mature
smooth muscle cells) and the mass is small and not growing, careful follow-up
is possible. Nevertheless, many women choose to have excision of the mass.
Most clinicians will excise any dominant three-dimensional mass occurring in
a woman over the age of 35 years, or in those with an increased likelihood of
mammary cancer (family history).

CLINICAL CASES

227

ANSWERS
26.1

C. The most common cause of bloody (serosanguineous) nipple discharge when only one duct is involved and in the absence of a breast
mass is intraductal papilloma. These are typically small, benign
tumors that grow in the milk ducts. The highest incidence of this
condition is in the 35 to 55 age group; causes and risk factors are
unknown. The discharge is typically serosanguineous like the woman
in this scenario. Because malignancy is also a common cause of
bloody nipple charge (Second most common cause!), ductal exploration is required to rule out cancer.

26.2

B. A diffuse “lumpy-bumpy” examination suggests fibrocystic changes.
They are very common in premenopausal women but rare following
menopause. The classic clinical picture includes cyclic, painful,
engorged breast, more pronounced just before menstruation, and occasionally associated with breast discharge. Treatment includes decreasing caffeine intake and adding NSAIDs, a tight-fitting bra, oral
contraceptives, or oral progestin therapy. With severe cases, danazol
(a weak antiestrogen and androgenic compound) or even mastectomy
is considered. A patient who presents with painful, engorged breasts
may also have a galactocele; however, a galactocele does not have a
“lumpy-bumpy” breast examination, nor is it associated with hormonal
changes or the menstrual cycle. Galactoceles are mammary gland
tumors that are cystic in nature and contain milk or milky fluid. They
typically occur when there is any sort of obstruction of milk flow in the
lactating breast.

26.3

D. Nipple retraction or skin dimpling over a mass is very suggestive
of malignancy. In the physical examination, maneuvers to accentuate the skin changes such as “hands on hips” or “arms raised over the
head” assist in evaluating for these findings. Most clinicians excise
any dominant three-dimensional mass occurring in a woman older
than 35 years or in those with an increased likelihood of mammary
cancer (family history). Histologic analysis from the excisional
biopsy will most likely confirm the diagnosis of cancer.

26.4

A. In females in the adolescent years or in their 20s, the most common cause of a dominant breast mass is a fibroadenoma. These
tumors are firm, rubbery, mobile, and solid in consistency. The best
way to image the breast of a woman less than age 30 is usually ultrasound due to the dense fibrocystic changes that interfere with mammographic interpretation. Ultrasound can differentiate a solid versus
a cystic mass, and sometimes can suggest a fibroadenoma; nevertheless, tissue should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.

228
26.5

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

B. In a woman who has a “red tender indurated breast” who is nonlactating, inflammatory breast cancer must be ruled out. Biopsy of the
breast is critical. Inflammatory breast cancer is aggressive in nature, and
the skin changes occur due to the cancer cells within the subdermal
lymph channels. Immediate diagnosis and therapy are crucial, whereas
delay with various antibiotics would be detrimental. Interestingly,
inflammatory breast cancer occurs more in younger patients, although
women of any age can be affected.

ANSWER TO CASE 27:
Infertility, Peritoneal Factor
Summary: An infertile couple is evaluated. Her menses are regular, and a
biphasic basal body temperature chart is recorded. She denies sexually transmitted diseases, and a hysterosalpingogram shows patent tubes and a normal
uterine cavity. The semen analysis is normal.
➤

Most likely etiology: Endometriosis (peritoneal factor).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the five basic etiologies of infertility.
2. Understand the history and laboratory tests for these five factors.
3. Understand that endometriosis is more common than cervical factor
infertility.

Considerations
This 31-year-old woman has secondary infertility. In approaching infertility, there
are five basic factors to examine: (1) ovulatory, (2) uterine, (3) tubal, (4) male
factor, and (5) peritoneal factor (endometriosis). The patient has regular
monthly menses. That by itself argues strongly for regular ovulation; the biphasic basal body temperature chart is further evidence for regular ovulation. The
uterine and tubal factors are normal based on the normal hysterosalpingogram,
which is a radiologic study in which dye is placed into the uterine cavity via a
transcervical catheter. The male factor is not an issue, based on the normal
semen analysis. Therefore the remaining factor not addressed is the peritoneal
factor. If the patient had prior cryotherapy to the cervix, the examiner might
be directed to consider cervical factor (rare); similarly, if the patient complained of the three Ds of endometriosis (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and
dyschezia), then the examiner would be pointed toward the peritoneal factor.
Since there are no hints favoring one factor over another, the clinician must
pick the most common condition, which is endometriosis.

APPROACH TO
Infertility
DEFINITIONS
INFERTILITY: Inability to conceive after 1 year of unprotected intercourse.
PRIMARY INFERTILITY: A woman has never been able to get pregnant.
SECONDARY INFERTILITY: A woman has been pregnant in the past, but

has 1 year of inability to conceive.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Infertility affects approximately 10% to 15% of couples in the reproductive
age group. Fecundability, defined as the probability of achieving a pregnancy
within one menstrual cycle, has been estimated at 20% to 25% for a normal
couple. On the basis of this estimate, approximately 90% of couples should
conceive after 12 months. The physician’s initial encounter with the couple
is very important and sets the tone for further evaluation and treatment. It is
extremely important that after the initial evaluation, a realistic plan be established and followed (Table 27–1).
The five main causes of infertility are as follows.
1. Ovulatory disorders (ovulatory factor). Ovulatory disorders account for
approximately 30% to 40% of all cases of female infertility. A history of
regularity or irregularity of the menses is fairly predictive of the regularity
of ovulation. The basal body temperature (BBT) chart is the easiest and
least expensive method of detecting ovulation (Figure 27–1).
The temperature should be determined orally, preferably with a basal
body thermometer, before the patient arises out of bed, eats, or drinks. The
chart documents the rise of temperature of about 0.5°F that occurs after
ovulation due to the release of progesterone (a thermogenic hormone) by
the ovary. The rise of temperature accounts for the biphasic pattern indicative of ovulation. Midluteal (day 21) serum progesterone level is an indirect method of documenting ovulation. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and,
particularly the LH surge, can be detected with self-administered urine test
kits. Ovulation occurs predictably about 36 hours after the onset of the LH
surge. Other tests include the endometrial biopsy showing secretory tissue,
or an ultrasound documenting a decrease in follicular size and presence of
fluid in the cul-de-sac, suggesting ovulation.
2. Uterine problems. The hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is the initial test for
intrauterine shape and tubal patency. It should be performed between days
6 and 10 of the cycle. Hysteroscopy likewise provides direct visualization

of the uterine cavity when the HSG suggests an intrauterine defect.
Uterine abnormalities have been associated with recurrent pregnancy
losses. Uterine myomata and, in particular, submucosal myomata may
interfere with implantation and fertility.
3. Tubal factor. A history of chlamydial or gonococcal cervicitis or salpingitis may point toward tubal disease. The hysterosalpingogram is fairly accurate but not perfect; hence, abnormal findings should be confirmed with
laparoscopy, which is considered the “gold standard” for diagnosing tubal
and peritoneal disease. In addition, operative laparoscopy can provide for
the treatment of tubal and peritoneal disease through a minimally invasive
technique.
4. Abnormalities in the semen (male factor). The semen analysis is a very
basic and noninvasive test and should be one of the initial examinations.
Even men who have fathered other children should have a semen analysis.

Figure 27–1. Basal body temperature chart. After ovulation, the temperature

The semen should be evaluated in terms of: volume (nl > 2.0 mL), sperm
concentration (nl > 20 million/mL), motility (nl > 50%), and morphology
(nl > 30% normal forms). An abstinence period of 2 to 3 days prior to
semen collection is recommended. One abnormal test is not sufficient to
establish the diagnosis of a male factor abnormality, and the test should be
repeated after 2 to 3 months (the process of transforming spermatogonia
into mature sperm cells requires 74 days).
5. Peritoneal factor (endometriosis). Endometriosis, a common condition
associated with infertility, should be suspected in any infertile woman. The
suspicion should increase if she complains of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, but often is present even in asymptomatic women. Although not completely understood, endometriosis may cause infertility by inhibiting
ovulation, inducing adhesions, and, perhaps, interfering with fertilization.
Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis, and
can allow for surgical ablation of the lesions. Lesions can be of various
appearances, from clear to red to the classic “powder burn” color.
Note: Cervical factor is considered as an infrequent etiology and may be
suspected with thick viscid cervical mucus before ovulation. Intrauterine
insemination, using a catheter to inject washed sperm through the cervix
bypasses the cervix.

best next step for this patient?
A. FSH therapy
B. Clomiphene citrate therapy
C. Laparoscopy
D. Intrauterine insemination

ANSWERS
27.1

D. Irregular menses usually means irregular ovulation, and therefore
infertility could most likely be attributed to an ovarian factor. The
three conditions to consider are polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS), which is most common, hypothalamic disturbances, and

CLINICAL CASES

235

premature ovarian failure (POF). Causes of hypothalamic disturbances affect pulsatile GnRH, such as hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia. Thus, the evaluation of a woman with irregular
ovulation usually includes checking TSH and prolactin levels.
Elevated FSH levels would suggest POF. Clomiphene citrate is a
treatment for anovulation, particularly polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS). The diagnosis of PCOS is a clinical one, with characteristics of obesity, anovulation, hirsutism, and possibly glucose intolerance. A laparoscopy would be indicated if there was suspicion of a
tubal factor causing infertility (such as a prior history (PMH) of
chlamydia or gonorrhea) or peritoneal factor (three Ds of
endometriosis). Intrauterine insemination is indicated when a cervical factor is thought to be the cause of infertility, such as thick viscid
cervical mucus before ovulation. This procedure bypasses the unfavorable cervix using a catheter to inject washed sperm. The patient
in this scenario does not present with symptoms consistent with cervical factor infertility. In vitro fertilization can be considered if the
problem was a tubal factor or male factor.
27.2

D. The history of chlamydial infection strongly suggests tubal factor
infertility. Laparoscopy would be the next step in management and is
considered the “gold standard” for diagnosing tubal and peritoneal disease. The patient does not present with any of the “three Ds” of peritoneal factor, and the semen analysis is normal which excludes
peritoneal factor and male factor as the cause for infertility. There is no
mention of a history of fibroids and she reports regular menses; this
eliminates uterine and ovulatory factors as the etiology of her infertility.

27.3

B. This patient’s history of dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia (two out
of the three Ds of peritoneal factor symptoms) suggests endometriosis,
which is best diagnosed by laparoscopy. A hysterosalpingogram visualizes the inside of the uterus and would not be helpful in the diagnosis of endometriosis, since it manifests outside the uterus, tubes,
and ovaries. She has menses every month; therefore her basal body
temperature chart should be normal. A progesterone assay may be
used to assess whether ovulation occurs, or the adequacy of the corpus luteum (a so-called luteal phase defect).

27.4

C. This patient presents with symptoms of tubal factor infertility. The
hysterosalpingogram (radiologic study in which dye is injected into the
uterus) is not specific and should be followed up with laparoscopy.
Laparoscopy can provide for treatment of tubal and peritoneal disease
through a minimally invasive technique. Clomiphene is not effective in
patients with tubal factor, and is indicated with anovulation. FSH therapy and intrauterine insemination would be ineffective for the same
reasons.

ANSWERS TO CASE 28:
Abdominal Pain in Pregnancy (Ovarian Torsion)
Summary: A 23-year-old G2 P1 woman at 29 weeks’ gestation with an 8-cm
ovarian cyst complains of a 12-hour history of colicky, right lower abdominal
pain and nausea with vomiting. The abdomen is tender in the right lower
quadrant region with significant involuntary guarding.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Torsion of the ovary.

➤

Best treatment for this condition: Surgery (laparotomy due to the pregnancy).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical presentation of some of the common causes of abdominal pain in pregnancy (acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, ovarian torsion, placental abruption, and ectopic pregnancy).
2. Understand that surgery is the best treatment for ovarian torsion.
3. Know that oophorectomy does not necessarily need to be performed in
ovarian torsion.

Considerations
This woman, who is pregnant at 29 weeks’ gestation, has a history of an 8-cm
ovarian cyst. The ovarian mass is most likely a dermoid cyst because of her age.
The acute onset of colicky, lower abdominal pain and nausea with vomiting
are consistent with ovarian torsion, which is the twisting of the ovarian vessels
leading to ischemia. Gastrointestinal complaints are common. The treatment
for ovarian torsion is surgical. If this woman were not pregnant, laparoscopy
would be an option. Sometimes, the size of the mass makes exploratory laparotomy the best choice. Upon opening the abdomen, the surgeon would examine the ovary for viability. Sometimes, untwisting of the ovarian pedicle can
lead to reperfusion of the ovary. An ovarian cystectomy, that is, removing only
the cyst and leaving the remainder of the normal ovarian tissue intact, is the
best treatment. This patient is somewhat atypical regarding the gestational
age, since the majority of pregnant women with ovarian torsion present either
at 14 weeks’ gestation when the uterus rises above the pelvic brim, or immediately postpartum when the uterus rapidly involutes.

APPROACH TO
Abdominal Pain in Pregnancy
CLINICAL APPROACH
Diseases related to and unrelated to the pregnancy must be considered.
Additionally, the pregnancy state may alter the risk factors for the different
causes of abdominal pain, and change the presentation and symptoms. Common
causes of abdominal pain in pregnant women include appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, ovarian torsion, placental abruption, and ectopic pregnancy. Often, it is
difficult to differentiate from among these different etiologies, but a careful history and physical and reexamination are the most important steps (Table 28–1).

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Acute Appendicitis
The diagnosis of appendicitis can be difficult to make because many of the
presenting symptoms are common complaints in pregnancy. Furthermore, a
delay in diagnosis (especially in the third trimester) frequently leads to maternal morbidity and perinatal problems, such as preterm labor and abortion.
Patients typically present with nausea, emesis, fever, and anorexia. The location of the abdominal pain is not typically in the right lower quadrant (as is
classic for nonpregnant patients), but instead is superior and lateral to
McBurney point. This is due to the effect of the enlarged uterus pushing on
the appendix to move it upward and outward toward the flank, at times
mimicking pyelonephritis. Diagnosis is made clinically, and because of the
morbidity involved in a missed diagnosis, it is generally better to err on the
side of overdiagnosing than underdiagnosing this disease. When appendicitis
is suspected, the treatment is surgical regardless of gestational age, along with
intravenous antibiotics.

Acute Cholecystitis
A common physiologic effect of pregnancy is an increase in gallbladder volume and biliary sludge (especially after the first trimester). The biliary sludge
then serves as a precursor to gallstones. While gallstones are often asymptomatic, the most common symptoms are right upper quadrant pain following a
meal, nausea, a “bloated sensation,” and, possibly, emesis. In the absence of
infection or fever, this is called biliary colic. Less commonly, when obstruction of the cystic or common bile duct occurs, the pain may be severe and
unrelenting, and the patient may become icteric. When fever and leukocytosis are present, the patient with gallstones likely has cholecystitis. Other complications of gallstones include pancreatitis and ascending cholangitis, a
serious life-threatening infection. The diagnosis of cholelithiasis is often
established by an abdominal ultrasound revealing gallstones and dilation and
thickening of the gallbladder wall. Simple biliary colic in pregnancy is usually
treated with a low-fat diet and observed until postpartum. However, in the
face of cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, or pancreatitis in pregnancy, surgery is the treatment of choice; generally, supportive medical management is
used initially during the acute phase.

Ovarian Torsion
Patients with known or newly diagnosed large ovarian masses are at risk for
ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion is the most frequent and serious complication
of a benign ovarian cyst. Pregnancy is a risk factor, especially around 14 weeks
and after delivery. Symptoms include unilateral abdominal and pelvic colicky
pain associated with nausea and vomiting. The acute onset of colicky pain is typical. Treatment is surgical with ovarian conservation if possible. If untwisting the

CLINICAL CASES

241

adnexa results in reperfusion, an ovarian cystectomy may be performed.
However, if perfusion cannot be restored, oophorectomy is indicated.

Placental Abruption
Abruption is a common cause of third-trimester bleeding and is usually associated with abdominal pain. Risk factors include a history of previous abruption,
hypertensive disease in pregnancy, trauma, cocaine use, smoking, or preterm
premature rupture of membranes. Patients typically present with vaginal bleeding with persistent crampy midline uterine tenderness and at times abnormal
fetal heart tracings. Diagnosis is made clinically and ultrasound is not very reliable. The treatment is generally delivery, often by cesarean.

Ectopic Pregnancy
The leading cause of maternal mortality in the first and second trimesters is
ectopic pregnancy. Patients usually have amenorrhea with some vaginal spotting and lower abdominal and pelvic pain. The pain is typically sharp and
tearing and may be associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical findings
include a slightly enlarged uterus and perhaps a palpable adnexal mass. In case
of ectopic ruptures, the patient may experience syncope or hypovolemia.
Transvaginal sonography and serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
levels can help with the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in more than 90% of
cases. Treatment options include surgery (especially with hemodynamically
unstable patients) and, in appropriately selected patients, methotrexate.

lateral aspect at the level of the umbilicus. There is mild right flank tenderness. A urinalysis is normal. In consideration of the diagnostic possibilities, which of the following is most accurate regarding this patient?
A. Appendicitis should be considered since the appendix location
changes during pregnancy.

Upon performing laparoscopy for a suspected ovarian torsion on an
18-year-old nulliparous woman, the surgeon sees that the ovarian vascular pedicle has twisted 1 to 1.5 times and that the ovary appears
somewhat bluish. Which of the following is the best management at
this point?
A. Oophorectomy with excision close to the ovary
B. Oophorectomy with excision of the vascular pedicle to prevent
possible embolization of the thrombosis
C. Unwind the vascular pedicle to assess the viability of the ovary
D. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
E. Intravenous heparin therapy

A 32-year-old G1 P0 woman at 29 weeks’ gestation presents with a
1-day history of severe midepigastric abdominal pain radiating to the
back, and multiple episodes of nausea and vomiting. On examination, her
BP is 100/60 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm, and temperature is 99°F (36.6°C).
Her abdominal examination has tenderness and diffuse rebound. The
serum amylase level is markedly elevated. Which of the following is the
next step?
A. Initiate a high-protein, low-fat diet
B. Immediate surgical excision of the inflamed aspect of the pancreas
C. Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen
D. Delivery of the infant

An 18-year-old G1 P0 woman complains of a 2-month history of colicky, right abdominal pain when she eats. It is associated with nausea
and emesis. She states that the pain radiates to her right shoulder. The
patient has a family history of diabetes. Which of the following is the
most likely diagnosis?
A. Peptic ulcer disease
B. Cholelithiasis
C. Appendicitis
D. Ovarian torsion

ANSWERS
28.1

A. The growing uterus pushes the appendix superior and lateral. The
diagnosis of appendicitis during pregnancy can be difficult since
patients frequently present with symptoms common in pregnancy.
A delay in diagnosis, on the other hand, can lead to maternal morbidity and perinatal problems. Typically, patients present with nausea,
emesis, fever, and anorexia. Abdominal pain is not located in the
right lower quadrant as in nonpregnant patients because the growing
uterus pushes on the appendix in an upward and outward direction,
toward the flank and sometimes mimicking pyelonephritis.

CLINICAL CASES

243

Regardless of gestational age, the treatment is surgical with IV
antibiotics. Cholecystitis is also common in pregnancy, but usually
presents with right abdominal pain in the subcostal region and may
radiate to the right shoulder. Gallstones are best diagnosed with
ultrasound rather than CT scan. Pyelonephritis almost always is associated with pyuria (WBC in urine), and usually causes fever and
flank tenderness. Inflammatory bowel disease presents in young
patients with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. This patient does
not have diarrhea or loose stools.
28.2

C. Unless the ovary appears necrotic, the ovarian pedicle can be
untwisted and the ovary observed for viability. An oophorectomy
would not be indicated in this patient unless the ovaries were
necrotic from the prolonged lack of perfusion, or if after untwisting
the ovary, reperfusion cannot be established. It is important to try
and conserve the ovary—especially in such a young patient.
Previously, it was thought that a torsed ovarian vasculature with
thrombus needed excision due to the possibility of embolization.
This has been disproved and neither excision of the clotted vessels
or heparin is required.

28.3

C. With the diagnosis of pancreatitis, the next diagnostic steps
include assessing the severity of the condition (such as with Ranson
criteria of hypoxia, hemorrhagic complications, renal insufficiency,
etc), and looking for an underlying etiology for the pancreatitis. In
pregnancy, the most common cause of pancreatitis is gallstones,
although alcohol use, hyperlipidemia, and medications are sometimes implicated. Thus, the best next step is ultrasound to assess for
gallstones. If gallstones are found, then consideration may be given
to eventual cholecystectomy once the patient is stabilized, or ERCP
if a common bile duct stone is suspected. A patient with pancreatitis should have nothing by mouth. Surgery on the inflamed pancreas
is harmful. Delivery of the pregnancy is not indicated.

28.4

B. This patient has a classic presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis (biliary colic). In pregnancy, this condition is usually treated
with a low-fat diet and observed until postpartum. However, if the
patient were to develop cholecystitis (gallstones with fever and
leukocytosis), biliary obstruction, or pancreatitis in pregnancy, surgery is the treatment of choice; generally, supportive medical management is used initially during the acute phase.

Clinical Pearls
➤ In pregnancy, the appendix moves superiorly and laterally from the normal
location.
➤ The acute onset of colicky abdominal pain is typical of ovarian torsion.
➤ With ovarian torsion, the clinician can untwist the pedicle and observe the
ovary for viability.
➤ Ectopic pregnancy should be suspected in any woman with abdominal
pain.
➤ Degenerating fibroids can cause intense localized pain and are treated
expectantly and with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors.

ANSWERS TO CASE 29:
Ectopic Pregnancy
Summary: A 19-year-old G2 Ab1 woman at 7 weeks’ gestation by LMP has
vaginal spotting. Her history is significant for a prior pelvic infection. Her BP
is 100/60 mm Hg, HR 90 bpm, and her abdomen is nontender. Pelvic examination shows a closed and nontender cervix, a uterus of 4 weeks’ size, and no
adnexal tenderness. The quantitative β-hCG is 2300 mIU/mL (Third
International Standard). A transvaginal sonogram reveals an empty uterus
and no adnexal masses.
➤

Next step: Laparoscopy.

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that any woman with amenorrhea and vaginal spotting or
lower abdominal pain should have a pregnancy test to evaluate the possibility of ectopic pregnancy.
2. Understand the role of the hCG level and the threshold for transvaginal
sonogram.
3. Know that the lack of clinical or ultrasound signs of ectopic pregnancy
does not exclude the disease.

Considerations
The woman is at 7 weeks’ gestation by last menstrual period and presents with
vaginal spotting. Any woman with amenorrhea and vaginal spotting should
have a pregnancy test. The physical examination is normal. Notably, the
uterus is slightly enlarged at 4 weeks’ gestational size. The enlarged uterus
does not exclude the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy, due to the human
chorionic gonadotropin effect on the uterus. The lack of adnexal mass or tenderness on physical examination likewise does not rule out an ectopic pregnancy. The hCG level and transvaginal ultrasound are key tests in the
assessment of an extrauterine pregnancy. The ultrasound is primarily used to
assess for the presence or absence of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), because
a confirmed IUP would decrease the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy significantly (risk 1:10,000 of both an intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy). Also,
the presence of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity, or a complex adnexal mass,
would make an extrauterine pregnancy more likely. This woman’s hCG level of
2300 mIU/mL is greater than the threshold of 1500 mIU/mL (transvaginal

CLINICAL CASES

247

sonography); thus, the patient has a high likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy.
Although the risk of an extrauterine pregnancy is high, it is not 100%.
Therefore, laparoscopy is indicated, and not methotrexate, since the latter
would destroy any intrauterine gestation.

APPROACH TO
Possible Ectopic Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
ECTOPIC PREGNANCY: A gestation that exists outside of the normal

endometrial implantation sites.
HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN: A glycoprotein produced by syncytiotrophoblasts, which is assayed in the standard pregnancy test.
THRESHOLD HCG LEVEL: The serum level of hCG where a pregnancy should
be seen on ultrasound examination. When the hCG exceeds the threshold and
no pregnancy is seen on ultrasound, there is a high likelihood of an ectopic
pregnancy.
LAPAROSCOPY: Surgical technique to visualize the peritoneal cavity through
a rigid telescopic instrument, known as a laparoscope.

CLINICAL APPROACH
See also Case 7.
The vast majority of ectopic pregnancies involve the fallopian tube (97%),
but the cervix, abdominal cavity, and ovary have also been affected. In the
United States, 2% of pregnancies are extrauterine. Hemorrhage from ectopic
gestation is the most common reason for maternal mortality in the first 20 weeks
of pregnancy. Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy are summarized in Table 29–1.
A woman with an ectopic pregnancy typically complains of abdominal
pain, amenorrhea of 4 to 6 weeks’ duration, and irregular vaginal spotting. In
case of ectopic ruptures, the pain becomes acutely worse, and may lead to syncope. Shoulder pain can be a prominent complaint due to the blood irritating
the diaphragm. An ectopic pregnancy can lead to tachycardia, hypotension,
or orthostasis. Abdominal or adnexal tenderness is common. An adnexal mass
is only palpable half the time; hence, the absence of a detectable mass does
not exclude an ectopic pregnancy. The uterus may be normal in size, or
slightly enlarged. A hemoperitoneum can be confirmed by the aspiration of
nonclotting blood with a spinal needle piercing the posterior vaginal fornix
into the cul-de-sac (culdocentesis).

Congenital abnormalities of the tube

The diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy can be a clinical challenge. The differential diagnosis is noted in Table 29–2.
The usual strategy in ruling out an ectopic pregnancy is to try to prove
whether an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) exists. Because the likelihood of a
coexisting intrauterine and extrauterine (heterotopic) gestation is so low, in the
range of 1 in 10,000, if a definite IUP is demonstrated, the risk of ectopic pregnancy becomes very low. Transvaginal sonography is more sensitive than transabdominal sonography, and can detect pregnancies as early as 5.5 to 6 weeks’
gestational age. Hence, the demonstration of a definite IUP by crown–rump
length or yolk sac is reassuring. The “identification of a gestational sac” is sometimes misleading since an ectopic pregnancy can be associated with fluid in the
uterus, a so-called “pseudogestational sac.” Other sonographic findings of an
extrauterine gestation include an embryo seen outside the uterus, or a large
amount of intra-abdominal free fluid, usually indicating blood.
Often, the quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin level is used in
conjunction with transvaginal sonography. When the hCG level equals or
exceeds 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL, an intrauterine gestational sac is usually
seen on transvaginal ultrasound; in fact, when the hCG level meets or
exceeds this threshold and no gestational sac is seen, the patient has a high

likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopy is usually performed in this
situation. When the hCG level is less than the threshold, and the patient does
not have severe abdominal pain, hypotension, or adnexal tenderness and/or
mass, then a repeat hCG level in 48 hours is permissible. A rise in the hCG
of at least 66% above the initial level is good evidence of a normal pregnancy; in contrast, a lack of an appropriate rise of the hCG is indicative of an
abnormal pregnancy, although the abnormal change does not identify whether
the pregnancy is in the uterus or the tube. Some practitioners will use a progesterone level instead of serial hCG levels to assess the health of the pregnancy. A progesterone level of greater than 25 ng/mL almost always correlates
with a normal intrauterine pregnancy, whereas a level of less than 5 ng/mL
almost always correlates with an abnormal pregnancy.
Treatment of an ectopic pregnancy may be surgical or medical.
Salpingectomy (removal of the affected tube) is usually performed for those
gestations too large for conservative therapy, when rupture has occurred, or
for those women who do not want future fertility. For a woman who wants to
preserve her fertility and has an unruptured tubal pregnancy, a salpingostomy
can be performed (Figure 29–1).
An incision is carried out along the long axis of the tube, and the pregnancy tissue is removed. The incision on the tube is not reapproximated
because suturing may lead to stricture formation. Conservative treatment of
the tube is associated with a 10% to 15% chance of persistent ectopic pregnancy. Serial hCG levels are, therefore, required with conservative surgical
therapy to identify this condition.
Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, is the principal form of medical therapy. It is usually given as a one-time, low-dose, intramuscular injection,
reserved for ectopic pregnancies less than 4 cm in diameter. Methotrexate is
highly successful, leading to resolution of properly chosen ectopic pregnancies
in 85% to 90% of cases. Occasionally, a second dose is required because the
hCG level does not fall. Between 3 to 7 days following therapy, a patient may
complain of abdominal pain, which is usually due to tubal abortion and, less
commonly, rupture. Most women may be observed; however, hypotension,
worsening or persistent pain, or a falling hematocrit may indicate tubal rupture and necessitate surgery. About 10% of women treated with medical therapy will require surgical intervention.
Rare types of ectopic gestations such as cervical, ovarian, abdominal, or
cornual (involving the portion of the tube that traverses the uterine muscle)
pregnancies usually require surgical therapy.

C. Observation in the hospital
D. Surgical therapy

252

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
29.1

C. When the hCG is below the threshold in an asymptomatic patient,
the hCG level may be repeated in 48 hours to assess for viability. If
the hCG level had been above the threshold in this patient, the
chances that an extrauterine pregnancy exists would be even more
likely (close to 100%), laparoscopy would be indicated to confirm suspicion. Since there is still a chance that this is a viable pregnancy,
methotrexate should not be used since it could destroy any intrauterine gestation. Dilation and curettage would also destroy any viable
intrauterine pregnancy, and would not be a good option for treatment
of an ectopic pregnancy since they exist outside the uterus.

29.2

D. A plateau in hCG over 48 hours means it is a nonviable pregnancy; this finding does not identify the location of the pregnancy.
Levels of hCG that plateau in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy indicate
an abnormal pregnancy, which may be either a miscarriage or an
ectopic pregnancy. It is unlikely that this patient had an incomplete
or a completed abortion, given that she does not recall any passage of
tissues.

29.3

A. A progesterone level greater than 25 ng/mL reflects a normal IUP.
This patient’s hCG level is below the threshold of being visible on
ultrasound, so it is a very early pregnancy. Spotting and lower
abdominal pain can be a normal occurrence in pregnancy, especially
very early in the first trimester. Some patients have symptoms of
lower abdominal pain, similar to menstrual cramps, and vaginal spotting during the first few weeks of pregnancy when the embryo
implants into the wall of the uterus.

29.4

A. The best use of ultrasound for assessment of an ectopic pregnancy
is to diagnose an IUP, as an IUP and coexisting ectopic pregnancy is
very rare. Color Doppler flow in the adnexal region is typically used
when there is suspicion of ovarian torsion and concern that the ovarian vessels are constricted and unable to perfuse the ovaries.
Assessment of adnexal masses using transvaginal ultrasound is not
very specific. A hemoperitoneum can be confirmed by culdocentesis,
but not typically a transvaginal ultrasound.

29.5

D. Surgery is indicated. Although this woman has an hCG level lower
than the threshold, she has an acute abdomen and this is most likely
due a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. If not addressed, the patient may
exsanguinate. Methotrexate requires several days to weeks to act, and
is appropriate in an asymptomatic patient with an ectopic pregnancy
less than 3.5 cm in size.

CLINICAL CASES

253

Clinical Pearls
➤ Levels of hCG that plateau in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy indicate an
abnormal pregnancy, which may either be a miscarriage or an ectopic
pregnancy.
➤ The classic triad of ectopic pregnancy is amenorrhea, vaginal spotting, and
abdominal pain.
➤ When the quantitative hCG exceeds 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL and the transvaginal sonogram does not show an intrauterine gestational sac, then the
risk of ectopic pregnancy is high.

Anemia in Pregnancy (Thalassemia)
Summary: A 29-year-old woman G2 P1 at 20 weeks’ gestation is being seen
for prenatal care. On examination, her BP is 100/60, HR 80 bpm, and temperature is normal. Her hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Anemia due to β-thalassemia minor.

➤

Underlying mechanism: Decreased β-globin chain production.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know that iron deficiency and thalessemia are common causes of microcytic anemia.
2. Understand that deficiency of folate and vitamin B12 are causes of anemia.
3. Know the diagnostic approach to anemia in pregnancy.

Considerations
This pregnant patient has a mild anemia, since the hemoglobin level is less
than 10.5 g/dL. The red blood cell (RBC) indices give an indication of the
etiology. In this case, the MCV is low, microcytic. The most common cause
of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency. Typically, with a mild microcytic anemia in the absence of risk factors for thalassemia (such as Southeast Asian
ethnicity), a trial of iron supplementation and recheck of the hemoglobin
in 3 weeks would be the next step. This is called a therapeutic trial of iron. If
the hemoglobin level improves, the evidence supports iron deficiency. If the
hemoglobin level does not improve, then iron studies and a hemoglobin electrophoresis would be the next step. In this case, iron studies were performed
which were normal/high normal, thus eliminating iron deficiency as a cause.
The hemoglobin electrophoresis studies strongly suggest β-thalassemia trait
(heterozygous for β-thalassemia) with the elevated A2 hemoglobin. If the
patient had β-thalassemia homozygous disease, there would have been complications and clinical manifestations since childhood. The patient should
now be counseled about her laboratory findings, referral to genetic counseling, and instructed that her baby has a 1 in 4 risk for β-thalassemia disease if
the father of the baby also has β-thalassemia trait. Extra iron should not be
given, since these patients can be prone to iron overload.

CLINICAL CASES

257

APPROACH TO
Anemia in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
ANEMIA: A hemoglobin level of less than 10.5 g/dL in the pregnant woman.
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA: A fall in hemoglobin level that is due to
insufficient iron to meet the increased iron requirements in pregnancy.
THALASSEMIA: A decreased production of one or more of the peptide
chains (most common are the α and β chains) that make up the globin molecule. This process may result in ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and
varying degrees of anemia.
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA: An abnormally low hemoglobin level due to red
blood cell destruction, which may be divided into congenital causes and
acquired causes.
GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY: An X-linked
condition whereby the red blood cells may have a decreased capacity for
anaerobic glucose metabolism. Certain oxidizing agents, such as nitrofurantoin, can lead to hemolysis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Physiology of Pregnancy
Anemia is a common complication in the pregnant woman. It is most often
due to iron deficiency, partially because of decreased iron stores prior to pregnancy, and increased demands for iron (due to fetus’ need and expanded
maternal blood volume). A hemoglobin level below 10.5 g/dL is usually considered a sign of anemia in the pregnant woman, with a mild anemia between
8 to 10 g/dL and severe as less than 7g/dL.

Iron Deficiency
A gravid woman who presents with mild anemia and no risk factors for hemoglobinopathies (African American, Southeast Asian, or Mediterranean
descent) may be treated with supplemental iron and the hemoglobin level
reassessed in 3 to 4 weeks. Persistent anemia necessitates an evaluation for
iron stores, such as ferritin level (low with iron deficiency) and hemoglobin
electrophoresis.

258

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Hemoglobinopathies
The size of the red blood cell may give a clue about the etiology. A microcytic
anemia is most commonly due to iron deficiency, although thalassemia may
also be causative. Results from a hemoglobin electrophoresis can differentiate between the two, and may also indicate the presence of sickle cell trait or
sickle cell anemia. The different types of thalassemias are classified according
to the peptide chain that is deficient. In β-thalassemia minor, for example,
there is a decreased production of the β-globin chain. This particular thalassemia during pregnancy is usually safe for both the mother and fetus, and
there is no specific therapy given other than prophylactic folic acid. A patient
may go their whole lives and not know they have β-thalassemia minor;
patients may remain asymptomatic throughout their lives. Genetic counseling in a patient with a known hemoglobinopathy is important because if the
baby inherits a recessive trait from both parents, they will typically be born
with a more serious or fatal disease (ie, β-thalassemia major). A neonate born
with β-thalassemia major may appear healthy at birth, but as the hemoglobin
F level falls (and no β-chains are able to replace the diminishing γ-chains
of the fetal hemoglobin), the infant may become severely anemic and fail to
thrive if not adequately transfused. The life expectancy with transfusions is
somewhere in the third decade.
Whereas the thalassemias are quantitative defects in a hemoglobin chain
production, sickle cell disease involves a qualitative defect that results in a
sickle-shaped and rigid hemoglobin molecule. Sickle cell anemia is a recessive disorder caused by a point mutation in the β-globin chain in which the
amino acid glutamic acid is replaced with valine. This results is improper folding of the hemoglobin molecule which results in either sickle cell disease
(HbSS) or sickle cell trait, (HbS), when only the sickle cell trait is inherited.
A patient with sickle cell trait should not be discouraged to get pregnant as
far as risk to her is concerned; however, her baby has a 1:4 chance of inheriting sickle cell disease if the father also has the sickle cell trait. Infants born
with sickle cell disease typically do not show signs of being affected until
about 4 months. Patients with sickle cell disease usually deal with symptoms
related to anemia (ie, fatigue and shortness of breath) and pain. In pregnancy,
women with sickle cell disease often have a more intense anemia, more frequent bouts of sickle cell crisis (painful vasoocclusive episodes), and more frequent infections and pulmonary complications. Careful attention must be taken
when a pregnant sickle cell patient presents in crisis because some of the symptoms may mimic other common occurrences during pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy, placental abruption, pyelonephritis, appendicitis, or cholecystitis), and
they may be missed. All causes of fever, pain, and low Hg laboratory value should
be considered before attributing it to a pain crisis. Also, these patients have a
higher incidence of fetal growth retardation and perinatal mortality; therefore,
serial ultrasonography is recommended.

CLINICAL CASES

259

Macrocytic Anemia
Macrocytic anemias may be due to vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. Because
vitamin B12 stores last for many years, megaloblastic anemias in pregnancy are
much more likely to be caused by folate deficiency.

Other Conditions
Less commonly, a woman with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
(G6PD) may develop hemolytic anemia triggered by various medications such
as sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, and antimalarial agents. Nitrofurantoin is a
common medication utilized for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
Affected women usually have dark-colored urine due to the bilirubinuria,
jaundice, and fatigue due to the anemia. G6PD deficiency is more commonly
seen in the African American population.
In the pregnant woman with anemia, jaundice, and thrombocytopenia, the
examiner must also consider other hemolytic processes, such as HELLP syndrome
(hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), which is a life-threatening condition best treated by delivery. In evaluating anemia, if other hematologic cell lines
are also decreased, such as the white blood cell count or platelet count, a bone marrow process, such as leukemia or tuberculosis infection of the marrow, should be
considered. Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated in these circumstances.

30.3

A 33-year-old African American G1 P0 at 16 weeks’ gestation is diagnosed with sickle cell trait. Her husband also is a carrier for the sickle
cell gene. Which of the following best describes the likelihood that
their unborn baby will have sickle cell disease?
A. 1/100
B. 1/50
C. 1/10
D. 1/4

30.4

A 36-year-old G2 P1 at 24 weeks’ gestation is noted to have fatigue of
4 weeks’ duration. Her hemoglobin level is 8.0 g/dL, leukocyte count
is 2.0 cells/uL, and platelet count is 20,000/uL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Iron deficiency anemia
B. HELLP syndrome
C. Severe preeclampsia
D. Acute leukemia

ANSWERS
30.1

B. This is a macrocytic anemia, since the mean corpuscular volume
is above normal. Macrocytic anemias include folate deficiency and
vitamin B12 deficiency; however, folate deficiency is more commonly
seen in pregnancy than vitamin B12 deficiency. Iron deficiency is a
microcytic anemia (MCV below normal), and it is the most common
cause of anemia in pregnancy. Physiologic anemia of pregnancy is a
result of the physiologic hemodilution that occurs in the vasculature.
There is a disproportionate increase in plasma volume over the
increased RBC volume, and this “diluted state” also gives the appearance of a fall in the laboratory values of hemoglobin and hematocrit.

30.2

C. This 29-year-old woman at 28 weeks’ gestation complains of fatigue.
She took an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection and then developed
dark-colored urine. She was also probably icteric. Currently, her hemoglobin level is low, reflecting an anemia. This constellation of symptoms likely reflects a hemolytic process. The dark urine suggests
bilirubinuria. Other causes of hemolysis could include malaria, HELLP
(hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or sickle cell crisis. In this case, the woman
ingested an antibiotic, which likely was nitrofurantoin, a commonly
prescribed medication for pregnant women. She does not have hypertension, symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases, or pain suggestive of sickle cell disease.

CLINICAL CASES

30.3

D. With autosomal recessive disorders, when both parents are heterozygous for the gene (gene carriers), then there is a 1:4 chance that
the offspring will be affected by the disease or will be homozygous for
the gene. It is important for expectant mothers, who are at high risk for
having the sickle cell disease or trait, to get a hemoglobin electrophoresis in addition to the other prenatal laboratory tests. They
need to know what risks they may have during pregnancy and be counseled on how to have a healthy pregnancy with sickle cell disease. They
should also know what kinds of risks they may have in either passing
the disease or trait to their children and may seek genetic counseling
for this reason. During pregnancy, pain crisis may be more severe, so it
is especially important for these women to stay well hydrated and avoid
dehydration. There is an increased rate of preterm labor and having a
low-birthweight baby in a sickle cell patient, but with proper prenatal
care, these women can have perfectly normal pregnancies.

30.4

D. Pancytopenia, a reduction in the number of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets
circulating throughout the body, suggests a bone marrow process. None of
the other answer choices involve low leukocyte counts (leucopenia). Low
platelets (thrombocytopenia) may also be a manifestation of severe
preeclampsia, and is part of the criteria for HELLP (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome as well. Iron deficiency
anemia involves low hemoglobin levels and is common in pregnancy due
to decreased iron stored prior to pregnancy, and increased demands for iron
during pregnancy. Since this patient’s blood work showed low WBCs, a
bone marrow biopsy should be done. A pregnant woman with leukemia
may require chemotherapy, which poses a risk to the developing fetus of
IUGR. Acute leukemia itself carries a risk for preterm labor, spontaneous
abortion, and stillbirth.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of anemia in pregnancy is iron deficiency.
➤ The two most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency
and thalassemia.
➤ An elevated A2 hemoglobin level is suggestive of β-thalassemia disorder,
whereas an elevated hemoglobin F level is suggestive of α-thalassemia.
➤ For mild anemias, it is acceptable to initiate a trial of iron supplementation
and reassess the hemoglobin level.
➤ The most common cause of megaloblastic anemia in pregnancy is folate
deficiency.
➤ Hemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may be triggered by sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, or antimalarial
agents.

ANSWERS TO CASE 31:
Preterm Labor
Summary: A healthy 19-year-old G1 P0 at 29 weeks’ gestation complains of
intermittent abdominal pain. Her vital signs are normal. The fetal heart rate
tracing reveals a baseline heart rate of 120 bpm and is reactive. Uterine contractions are noted every 3 to 5 minutes. Her cervix is 3 cm dilated, 90%
effaced, and the fetal vertex is presenting at −1 station.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Preterm labor.

➤

Next step in management: Tocolysis, try to identify a cause of the
preterm labor, antenatal steroids, and antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis.

➤

Test of vaginal fluid: Fetal fibronectin assay.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand how to diagnose preterm labor.
2. Understand that the basic approach to preterm labor is tocolysis, identification of an etiology, and steroids (if appropriate).
3. Know the common causes of preterm delivery.

Considerations
This 19-year-old nulliparous woman is at 29 weeks’ gestation and complains
of intermittent abdominal pain. The monitor indicates uterine contractions
every 3 to 5 minutes, and her cervix is dilated at 3 cm and effaced at 90%.
This is sufficient to diagnose preterm labor in a nulliparous woman. If she had
a previous vaginal delivery, the diagnosis may not be as clear-cut. Because of
the significant prematurity, many practitioners may elect to treat for preterm
labor. A single examination revealing 2 cm dilation and 80% effacement in a
nulliparous woman would be sufficient to diagnose preterm labor. Prior to digital examination, swabbing the posterior vaginal fornix for fetal fibronectin
(ffn), which if positive may indicate risk of preterm birth. In contrast, a negative ffn assay is strongly associated with no delivery within 1 week. Another
objective test for preterm delivery risk is transvaginal cervical length ultrasound measurements. A shortened cervix, especially with lower uterine segment changes (funneling or beaking of the amniotic cavity into the cervix),
are worrisome. Tocolysis should be initiated, unless there is a contraindication
(such as intra-amniotic infection or severe preeclampsia). Also, since the

CLINICAL CASES

265

pregnancy is less than 34 weeks’ gestation, intramuscular antenatal steroids
should be given to enhance fetal pulmonary maturity. A careful search should
also be undertaken to identify an underlying cause, such as urinary tract infection, cervical infection, bacterial vaginosis, generalized infection, trauma or
abruption, hydramnios, or multiple gestations. Finally, intravenous antibiotics,
such as penicillin, are helpful in case the tocolysis is unsuccessful, to reduce the
likelihood of GBS sepsis in the neonate.

APPROACH TO
Preterm Labor
DEFINITIONS
PRETERM LABOR: Cervical change associated with uterine contractions
prior to 37 completed weeks and after 20 weeks’ gestation. In a nulliparous
woman, uterine contractions and a single cervical examination revealing 2-cm
dilation and 80% effacement or greater is sufficient to make the diagnosis.
TOCOLYSIS: Pharmacologic agents used to delay delivery once preterm labor
is diagnosed. The most commonly used agents are indomethacin, nifedipine,
terbutaline, and ritodrine. Recent evidence has indicated that magnesium sulfate may be ineffective.
ANTENATAL STEROIDS: Betamethasone or dexamethasone given intramuscularly to the pregnant woman in an effort to decrease some of the
complications of prematurity, particularly respiratory distress syndrome
(intraventricular hemorrhage in the more extremely premature babies).
FETAL FIBRONECTIN ASSAY: A basement membrane protein that helps
bind placental membranes to the decidua of the uterus. A vaginal swab is used
to detect its presence. Its best utility is a negative result, which is associated
with a 99% chance of not delivering within 1 week.
CERVICAL LENGTH ASSESSMENT: Transvaginal ultrasound to measure the
cervical length. Cervical length less than 25 mm results in an increased risk
of preterm delivery. Also an impinging of the amniotic cavity into the cervix,
so-called funneling, increases the risk of preterm delivery.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Preterm labor is defined as cervical change in the midst of regular uterine contractions occurring between 20 and 37 weeks’ gestation. The incidence in the
United States is approximately 11% of pregnancies, and it is the cause of significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. There are many risk factors associated with preterm delivery (Table 31–1).

The main symptoms of preterm labor are uterine contractions and abdominal
tightening. Sometimes, pelvic pressure or increased vaginal discharge may also
be present. The diagnosis is established by confirming cervical change over time
by the same examiner, if possible, or finding the cervix to be 2 cm dilated and
80% effaced in a nulliparous woman. Once the diagnosis has been made, then
an etiology should be sought. Tocolysis is considered if the gestational age is less
than 34 to 35 weeks, and steroids are administered if the gestational age is less
than 34 weeks. The work-up for preterm labor is summarized in Table 31–2.
Recent randomized controlled trials have suggested that magnesium sulfate
is not effective as a tocolytic agent. Other medications include terbutaline, ritodrine, nifedipine, and indomethacin. The speculated mechanism of action of
magnesium is competitive inhibition of calcium to decrease its availability for
actin-myosin interaction, thus decreasing myometrial activity (see Table 31–3).
Nifedipine reduces intracellular calcium by inhibiting voltage-activated calcium channels. Side effects include pulmonary edema, respiratory depression,

neonatal depression, and if given long term, osteoporosis. Pulmonary edema
is often the most serious side effect, and is seen more often with the β-agonist
agents. A complication of indomethacin is closure of the ductus arteriosus,
leading to severe neonatal pulmonary hypertension.
Antenatal steroids are given between 24 and 34 weeks’ gestation when
there is no evidence of infection. Only one course of corticosteroids is utilized. In other words, they are not repeated for recurrent threatened preterm
delivery. In the early gestational ages, the effect is to lower the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage; at gestations greater than 28 weeks, the primary goal
is to lower the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. Weekly injections
of 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate from 20 weeks’ gestation until 36 weeks’
gestation has been shown to help prevent preterm birth in women at high
risk. These include a history of previous spontaneous preterm delivery.

CLINICAL CASES

269

31.3

A 35-year-old G1 P0 woman at 32 weeks’ gestation is noted to be seen
in the obstetric (OB) triage unit the previous day with uterine contractions. On admission, the fetal heart rate is 140 bmp with accelerations and no decelerations. A fetal fibronectin assay is performed
which is positive. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the patient
was examined and noted to have cervical dilation from 1 to 2 cm and
effacement from 30% to 90%. A tocolytic agent is used. A repeat fetal
heart rate pattern reveals a baseline of 140 bpm with moderate repetitive variable decelerations. Which of the following is the most likely
tocolytic agent used?
A. Nifedipine
B. Indomethacin
C. Magnesium sulfate
D. Terbutaline

31.4

A 28-year-old woman G1 P0 at 29 weeks’ gestation is treated with
terbutaline for preterm labor. Her cervix had dilated to 3 cm and 90%
effaced. She also received betamethasone intramuscularly to enhance
fetal lung maturity. The following day, the patient develops dyspnea,
tachypnea, and an oxygen saturation level of 80%. Oxygen is given.
Which of the following is the best therapeutic agent?
A. IV antibiotic therapy for probably pneumonia
B. IV heparin therapy for probable deep venous thrombosis
C. IV furosemide for probable pulmonary edema
D. Oral digoxin for probable cardiomyopathy

ANSWERS
31.1

D. Infections of various types are associated with preterm delivery.
Gonococcal cervicitis is strongly associated with preterm delivery,
whereas chlamydial infection is not as strongly associated. Urinary
tract infections, particularly pyelonephritis, are associated with
preterm delivery. Bacterial vaginosis may be linked with preterm
delivery, although treatment of this condition does not seem to affect
the risk.

31.2

A. Suspected abruption is a relative contraindication for tocolysis
because the abruption may extend. The natural history of abruption is
extension of the separation, leading to complete shearing of the placenta from the uterus. If this happens, delivery would be the best treatment with the administration of antenatal steroids to decrease the
chance of respiratory distress syndrome in the preterm baby; expectant
management may be exercised if the patient is stable with no active
bleeding or sign of fetal compromise since this is a premature fetus.
Nevertheless, giving tocolytics would increase the mother’s chance of

270

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

hemorrhage after delivery because it will be more difficult to get the
uterus to contract on itself, since tocolytics also act as uterine relaxant.
Infection with Group B streptococcal bacteriuria is not a contraindication for tocolysis; however the mother should be placed on antibiotic
prophylaxis in the event that she delivers or has preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). A recent laparotomy and uterine fibroid
may increase the risk of preterm labor, but would not be a contraindication for administration of tocolytics, assuming both the mother and
fetus are stable.
31.3

B. This patient has a change in her fetal heart rate tracing after tocolysis is used. Now, she has significant variable decelerations, which is
caused by cord compression. A sudden change increasing variable
decelerations can include oligohydramnios (less amniotic fluid to
buffer the cord from compression), rupture of membranes, or descent
of the fetal head, such as in labor, so that a nuchal cord (around the
neck) may tighten. Indomethacin is associated with decreased amniotic fluid and oligohydramnios, and this is the most likely etiology.

31.4

C. In a patient on tocolytic therapy, pulmonary edema is a hazard,
particularly when on β-agonists. The tachycardia that often occurs
decreases the diastolic filling time, leading to increased end-diastolic
pressure. Besides oxygen, IV furosemide is effective in decreasing
intravascular fluid and thus decreasing hydrostatic pressure, hopefully relieving the fluid from the interstitial spaces of the lungs. The
terbutaline of course also should be discontinued. A β-agonist therapy is associated with an increased pulse pressure, hyperglycemia,
hypokalemia, and tachycardia.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Dyspnea occurring in a woman with preterm labor and tocolysis is usually
due to pulmonary edema.
➤ The goal in treating preterm labor is to identify the cause, give steroids
(if gestation is at 24 to 34 weeks), and tocolysis.
➤ The most common cause of neonatal morbidity in a preterm infant is respiratory distress syndrome.
➤ β-Agonist therapy has multiple side effects including tachycardia, widened
pulse pressure, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia.
➤ A negative cervical fetal fibronectin assay virtually guarantees no delivery
within 1 week.
➤ Transvaginal sonography indicating a shortened cervix especially with
funneling and/or beaking is suggestive of risk for preterm delivery.

Urinary Tract Infection (Cystitis)
Summary: A 29-year-old woman complains of a 2-day history of dysuria,
urgency, and urinary frequency. Her temperature is 98°F (36.6°C). She does
not have back tenderness. The abdomen is nontender and without masses.
The pelvic examination is normal.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Simple cystitis (bladder infection).

➤

Next step in the diagnosis: Urinalysis and/or urine culture.

➤

Most likely etiology of the condition: Escherichia coli.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the symptoms of a urinary tract infection (cystitis).
2. Know that the most common bacteria causing cystitis is E coli.
3. Be familiar with some of the antibiotic therapies for cystitis.

Considerations
This 29-year-old woman has a 2-day history of urinary urgency, frequency, and
dysuria, all which are very typical symptoms of a urinary tract infection.
Because she does not have fever or flank tenderness, she most likely has a bladder infection or cystitis. Other symptoms of cystitis include hesitancy or hematuria (hemorrhagic cystitis). Urinalysis and/or urine culture and sensitivity
would be the appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis. Since E coli is the most
common etiologic agent, the antibiotic treatment should be aimed at this
organism. Sulfa agents, cephalosporins, quinolones, or nitrofurantoin are all
acceptable. If the urine culture returns showing no organism and the patient
still has symptoms, urethritis is a possibility (often caused by Chlamydia
trachomatis). In this setting, urethral swabbing for chlamydial testing is advisable. Another possibility is candidal vulvovaginitis. Finally, some women with
symptoms of bladder discomfort with negative urine culture and urethral culture may have a chronic condition of urethral syndrome.

CLINICAL CASES

275

APPROACH TO
Urinary Tract Infections
DEFINITIONS
CYSTITIS: Bacterial infection of the bladder defined as having greater than

100,000 colony-forming units of a single pathogenic organism on a midstreamvoided specimen.
URETHRITIS: Infection of the urethra commonly caused by C trachomatis.
URETHRAL SYNDROME: Urgency and dysuria caused by urethral inflammation of unknown etiology; urine cultures are negative.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Urinary tract infections (UTI) may involve the kidneys (pyelonephritis), bladder (cystitis), and urethra (urethritis). One in five women will acquire a UTI
sometime in her life. The shorter urethra and its proximity to the rectum are
the most commonly stated reasons for the increased incidence in women.
Pregnancy further predisposes women to UTIs due to incomplete emptying of
the bladder, ureteral obstruction, and immune suppression. Pathogenic bacteria include E coli (isolated 80% of the time) followed by Enterobacter, Klebsiella,
Pseudomonas, Proteus, group B streptococcus, Staphyloccoccus saprophyticus, and
Chlamydia.
The most common symptoms of lower tract infection (cystitis) are dysuria,
urgency, and urinary frequency. Occasionally, the infection may induce a
hemorrhagic cystitis and the patient will have gross hematuria. Nevertheless,
gross hematuria should raise the suspicion of nephrolithiasis. Fever is uncommon unless there is kidney involvement, which is usually reflected by flank
tenderness. The diagnosis of cystitis hinges on identification of pathogenic
bacteria in the urine; bacteriuria is defined as greater than 100,000 colonyforming units per milliliter of a single uropathogen obtained from a midstream
voided urine on culture. In symptomatic patients, as few as 1000 colonyforming units per milliliter may be significant. On a catheterized specimen,
10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter is considered bacteriuria. The presence of leukocytes in the urine is presumptive evidence of infection in a
patient with symptoms.
Simple cystitis is the most common form of UTI and is diagnosed by the
symptoms in the absence of fever or flank tenderness. Oral antimicrobial therapy is effective, and varies from one dose to 3 days, to 7 days, or even 10 days.
Trimethoprim/sulfa (Bactrim), nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and
cephalosporins, such as cephalothin, are effective. Ampicillin is generally not
used due to the widespread resistance of E coli. The utility of urine cultures in

276

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

the first episode of simple cystitis is unclear. Some practitioners will routinely
obtain cultures, whereas others will reserve these studies for recurrences, persistent symptoms, or in pregnancy. In the pregnant woman, asymptomatic
bacteriuria (ASB) leads to acute infection in up to 25% of untreated
women and thus it should always be treated.
A patient with urethritis has similar complaints to one with cystitis
(ie, urgency, frequency, and dysuria). Sometimes, the urethra may be tender on
palpation and purulent drainage expressed on examination. The most commonly
isolated organisms are Chlamydia, Gonococcus, and Trichomonas. Urethritis
should be suspected in a woman with typical symptoms of UTI yet with sterile
culture and no response to the standard antibiotics. Cultures of the urethra for
Gonococcus and Chlamydia should be performed. Treatment may be initiated
empirically for Chlamydia with doxycycline; if Neisseria gonorrhea is suspected,
intramuscular ceftriaxone with oral doxycycline is usually curative. Doxycycline
should be avoided in pregnant women.
Women with pyelonephritis usually present with fever, chills, flank pain,
and nausea and vomiting. Mild cases in the nonpregnant female may be
treated with oral trimethoprim/sulfa or a fluoroquinolone for a 10- to 14-day
course; these women should be reexamined within 48 hour. Sulfa agents are
generally the most cost-effective. Those who are more ill, unable to take oral
medications, pregnant, or immunocompromised should be hospitalized and
treated with intravenous antibiotics, such as ampicillin and gentamicin, or a
cephalosporin, such as cefazolin, cefotetan, or ceftriaxone. Following resolution of fever and symptoms, pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis are
often treated with suppressive antimicrobial therapy (such as nitrofurantoin
macrocrystals 100 mg once daily) for the remainder of pregnancy.

urinary tract infection with 100,000 cfu/mL of E coli growing on culture. Her obstetrician notes that an upper urinary tract infection leads
to increased complications. Which of the following is a common manifestation of upper urinary tract infection rather than simple cystitis?
A. Fever
B. Urgency
C. Hesitancy
D. Dysuria

ANSWERS
32.1

B. The most common cause of UTIs in women is E coli. Other causes
include Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Proteus. Chlamydia
trachomatis is a common cause of urethritis along with Gonococcus and trichomonas. Peptostreptococcus is a gram-positive anaerobe that is a commensal organism with humans and usually does not cause pathology
except in immunosuppressed individuals. Along with Peptostreptococcus,
Bacteroides species live as gut flora in humans. Bacteroides is a gramnegative anaerobe and, along with other anaerobes, rarely causes cystitis.

32.2

C. This patient has asymptomatic bacteriuria, which should be treated
even without symptoms. If untreated, the patient has a 25% risk of developing pyelonephritis during the pregnancy. Asymptomatic bacteriuria
(ASB) complicates approximately 8% to 10% of pregnant patients.
Providing treatment of ASB at the first prenatal visit reduces the risk of
pyelonephritis markedly.

32.3

A. Upper UTIs (including pyelonephritis) usually present with fever,
costovertebral tenderness, chills, malaise, and often ill-appearing individual. They are at increased risk for septicemia, kidney dysfunction,
or preterm labor. In severe cases, patient should be hospitalized and
started on intravenous antibiotics. Presenting symptoms of urgency,
hesitancy, and dysuria are symptoms for a simple cystitis or urethritis.

278

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Urethritis can be differentiated from cystitis by a sterile culture and
no response to antibiotics. Doxycycline (covers Chlamydia) with
ceftriaxone (gonorrhea) is a good choice for suspected urethritis.
Doxycycline should be avoided in pregnant women.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of cystitis is E coli.
➤ Bacteriuria caused by group B streptococcus in pregnancy necessitates
the use of intravenous penicillin or ampicillin in labor to decrease the risk
of neonatal GBS sepsis.
➤ Pyelonephritis presents with flank tenderness and fever.
➤ Urethritis, commonly caused by Chlamydia or N gonorrhea, should be suspected with negative urine cultures and symptoms of a UTI.
➤ Asymptomatic bacteriuria has a high incidence in women with sickle cell
trait.

Case 33
A 25-year-old G2 P2002 desires contraception for the next 3 years. She
reports that she had a deep venous thrombosis when she took the combination oral contraceptive pill 2 years ago. She cannot remember to
take the pill every day and wants contraception that will allow her to be
spontaneous. She does not take any medications and has no known
allergies to medications. Menarche was age 13. Menstrual cycle is every
28 days, lasting for 7 days. She has quarter-size clots the first 3 days of
her menstrual cycle. She has been married for 3 years and denies any
sexually transmitted infections. Her blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg,
heart rate 80 beats per minute (bpm), and temperature 99°F (37.2°C).
Heart and lung examinations are normal. The abdomen is nontender
and without masses. Pelvic examination reveals a normal anteverted
uterus and no adnexal masses.

ANSWERS TO CASE 33:
Contraception
Summary: A 25-year-old multiparous woman, in a stable monogamous relationship, desires long-term contraception. She has had a DVT while taking a
combination oral contraceptive pill, is forgetful about taking pills everyday,
and wants contraception that will allow spontaneity. She reports heavy menses.
Physical examination is within normal limits.
➤

Best contraceptive agent for this patient: The levonorgestrel releasing
intrauterine device.

➤

Contraindications to the proposed contraceptive agent: Contraindications
for an IUD include recent sexually transmitted infection, behavior that
increases risk for sexually transmitted infections, abnormal size and shape of
the uterus.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the various types of contraceptive agents including indications and
contraindications, mechanisms of action, and efficacy.
2. Know benefits, risks, and contraindications for the combination oral contraceptive pill.
3. Know about intrauterine devices.
4. Know about emergency contraception.

Considerations
Each form of contraception has advantages and disadvantages, and the individual patient situation should be evaluated to find the best contraceptive
choice. Factors that assist the physician in the counseling of the patient
include agents requiring more patient action, such as remembering to take a
pill each day, or putting on a barrier device (diaphragm or condom), duration
of contraception desired, history of sexually transmitted infections, amount of
vaginal bleeding, and medical complications. Because of the history of DVT,
estrogen-containing contraception agents would be contraindicated. The
desire for spontaneity would make barrier methods less desirable. Options for
this patient would include depomedroxyprogesterone acetate or the levonorgestrel IUD. Because of the heavy menses, this 25 year old would most
benefit from a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, since the progestin would cause the endometrial lining to be thinner and decrease the

amount of menstrual bleeding. This device is placed inside the uterus by a
physician during an office visit and can be left in place for up to 5 years.
It does not rely on the patient’s memory for effectiveness. The progestin in
the IUD is released slowly over time and can decrease the amount and frequency of menses. The IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted
infections. Also, this patient has had a DVT which is a contraindication to
any form of contraception that contains a combination of estrogen and progestin, like the combination oral contraceptive pill, patch, or ring.

APPROACH TO
Contraception
DEFINITIONS
INTRAUTERINE CONTRACEPTIVE DEVICES (IUD): Small T-shaped

device, usually plastic with or without copper or a progestin, placed in the
endometrial cavity as a method of long-term contraception.
TYPICAL USE EFFECTIVENESS: Overall efficacy in actual use, when forgetfulness and improper use occur.
PERFECT USE EFFECTIVENESS: Efficacy of a method when always used
correctly, consistent and reliable use occur.
BARRIER CONTRACEPTIVE: Prevents sperm from entering upper female
reproductive tract.
STEROID HORMONE CONTRACEPTION: Synthetic estrogen and/or progestin to provide contraception in various methods, including oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, contraceptive injection,
and implant.
YUZPE REGIMEN: Use of specific oral contraceptive regimen first reported
by Dr Yuzpe, consisting of two tablets of Ovral oral contraceptives (total of
0.1 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.5 mg levonorgestrel) at time zero and two
tablets after 12 hours.
PLAN B (PROGESTIN ONLY): Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg taken orally at time
zero and the same dose after 12 hours.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Contraceptive agents have different effectiveness, which are characterized as
theoretical (or perfect) and with typical use (see Table 33–1). The various
agents each have particular advantages and disadvantages and unique factors
that may make one method better suited for a particular patient. Thus, the
history and physical examination should focus on a patient’s preference of

method, factors such as the ability to remember to take a pill every day, and
other medical conditions (see Table 33–2).
Barrier contraceptives prevent sperm from entering the upper female
reproductive tract. Various forms include the male condom, female condom,
vaginal diaphragm, cervical cap, and spermicides. The male condom is made of
latex, polyurethane, or animal tissue. It is a sheath placed on an erect penis
prior to intercourse and ejaculation. The latex condom is the most effective
method of contraception to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted
infections. It is the second most commonly used method of reversible contraception in the United States. The female condom is a sheath with two
polyurethane rings. One ring is placed inside the vagina at the closed end of
the sheath and provides an insertion mechanism and anchor. The second ring
is at the outer edge of the device and is outside the vagina providing coverage
for the labia and the base of the penis. It should offer more protection against
transmission of certain infections, like genital herpes. The vaginal diaphragm

must be fit by a physician. It should be placed 1 to 2 hours before intercourse,
be used with a spermicide, and be left in place for at least 8 hours after coitus.
Drawbacks include higher rate of urinary tract infections and increased risk of
ulceration to the vaginal epithelium with prolonged usage. The cervical cap is
also fit by a physician. Compared to a diaphragm, the cap can be left in place
for up to 48 hours and is more comfortable. It is also carries a risk of ulceration and infection of the cervix if left in place for too long. However, the cap
is only for use in women with normal cervical cytology due to concern of
traumatizing the cervix. Spermicides include gels, foams, suppositories, and
jellies placed in the vagina. The active agent is nonoxynol-9 which disrupts
the sperm cell membrane and provides a mechanical barrier. The contraceptive sponge is made of polyurethane impregnated with 1 mg of nonoxynol-9
and does not have to be inserted into the vagina before each act of intercourse. Its use is associated with lower pregnancy rate in nulliparous women
compared to parous women. Advantages of barrier methods include low cost,
decreased transmission of certain sexually transmitted diseases, and no
requirement for continuous hormonal exposure or ongoing IUD use due to
use only at time of coitus. Disadvantages include relatively high failure rate
due to required use with each act of intercourse.
Oral contraceptives were initially marketed in the United States in 1960.
These quickly became the most-used method of reversible contraception
among women. Oral steroid contraceptives come in combination pills at a
fixed dose or a phased dose, or a progestin-only pill (minipill). The main
effect of the progestin is to inhibit ovulation and cause cervical mucus thickening. The main effect of the estrogen is to maintain the endometrium, prevent unscheduled bleeding, and inhibit follicular development. The most
common side effects are relatively mild and include nausea, breast tenderness,
fluid retention, or weight gain.
The main risks of combined hormonal contraception are due to the estrogen component and include venous thromboembolism, strokes in patients
with migraines with aura, myocardial infarction in women smokers age 35
and older, increased risk of cholelithiasis, and benign hepatic tumors. Use of
oral contraceptives decreases the risk of developing ovarian or endometrial
cancer, shortens the duration of menses, decreases blood loss during menses,
improves pain from dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, decreases dysfunctional
uterine bleeding and menorrhagia, and improves acne.
The World Health Organization contraindications to combined hormonal
contraceptives include known thrombogenic mutations, prior thromboembolic event, cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease (current or remote),
uncontrolled hypertension, migraines with aura, diabetes with peripheral vascular disease, smoking and age 35 years or older, known or suspected breast
cancer, history of, or known or suspected, estrogen-dependent neoplasia,
undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding, benign or malignant liver tumors,
active liver disease, liver failure, known or suspected pregnancy.

The contraceptive patch delivers norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol
transdermally. It is worn on the buttocks, upper outer arm, lower abdomen, or
upper torso excluding the breast. It is changed weekly for 3 weeks followed by
a week without a patch to allow for withdrawal bleed. In women weighing
greater than 90 kg, efficacy may be less. A recent FDA warning indicated the
risk of DVT was twice that of OCP. The contraceptive ring allows steroids to
be absorbed through the vaginal epithelium into circulation. The ring is worn
for 21 days and then removed for 7 days to allow for withdrawal bleed. The
patch and ring have similar efficacy and side effects to combination oral
contraceptives.
Only one injectable contraceptive is currently available in the United
States, depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). It is administered subcutaneously every 3 months. Women receiving the injection have a very low
pregnancy rate. There is a significant disruption of the normal menstrual cycle
that usually leads to amenorrhea.
A single subdermal implant, placed in a woman’s upper arm, releases a
steady amount of levonorgestrel. The duration of action for this implant,
named Implanon, is 3 years. Return to fertility is delayed about 2 weeks after
cessation of pills, patches, or rings, and by about 4 weeks after stopping contraceptive injection. Post-pill amenorrhea may persist for up to 6 months.
An intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) is a small device, usually plastic with or without copper or a progestin, placed in the endometrial cavity as
a method of contraception. Two IUDs are currently available in the United
States: the copper T380A and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine
device. The copper T380A has approved use for 10 years and has a 10-year
cumulative pregnancy rate comparable to that of sterilization. Many mechanisms of action have been described for the copper-containing IUD, including
inhibition of sperm migration and viability, change in transport speed of the
ovum, and damage to or destruction of the ovum.
The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device releases 20 μg of levonorgestrel daily and is approved for use for 5 years. It works by thickening the
cervical mucus and creating an atrophic endometrium. The small amount of
steroid causes minimal amounts of systemic side effects, and it also decreases menstrual bleeding due to the local effect on the endometrium. The levonorgestrelreleasing IUD also has noncontraceptive benefits and can be used to treat patients
with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and pain due to endometriosis and adenomyosis.
IUDs are most appropriate for women who are in stable, mutually monogamous relationships at low risk for sexually transmitted infections. Both IUDs
have the advantage of requiring a single act of motivation for long-term use.
The efficacy is 0.5% to 0.1%. They also have rapid return to fertility after
removal of the device. Insertion has an infrequent association with uterine
perforation (1:1000) and transiently increases the risk of upper genital infection (1:1000) due to endometrial contamination.
WHO contraindications to IUD insertion include current pregnancy, current sexually transmitted infection, current or pelvic inflammatory disease

288

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

within the past 3 months, unexplained vaginal bleeding, malignant gestational trophoblastic disease, untreated cervical cancer, untreated endometrial
cancer, uterine fibroids distorting the endometrial cavity, current breast cancer (for levonorgestrel-releasing IUD only), anatomical abnormalities distorting the uterine cavity, known pelvic tuberculosis, and allergy to component
of IUD or Wilson disease (for copper-containing IUD).
Emergency contraception is the therapy for women who have had unprotected sexual intercourse, including victims of sexual assault. It is also known
as the “morning after pill.” The two most common regimens are the combination oral contraceptive method, known as the Yuzpe method, and the
progestin-only regimen. The Yuzpe method consists of 0.1 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 0.5 mg of levonorgestrel in two doses, 12 hours apart, beginning
within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. The progestin-only (plan B)
method consists of 0.75 mg of levonorgestrel in two doses taken 12 hours
apart. The mechanisms of action may include inhibition of ovulation, decreased
tubal motility, and, possibly, interruption of implantation.
The efficacy of the combination method is accepted to be about a 75%
reduction in pregnancy rate, thus decreasing the risk of a midcycle coital pregnancy from 8 per 100 to about 2 per 100. The progestin-only method appears
to have slightly greater efficacy, with a pregnancy risk reduction of about 85%.
The major side effect of emergency contraception is nausea and/or emesis,
which is more prominent with the combination method. An antiemetic is
often prescribed with the Yuzpe regimen. Emergency contraception should
not be used in patients with a suspected or known pregnancy, or those with
abnormal vaginal bleeding. Those women who do not have onset on menses
within 21 days following the emergency contraception should have a pregnancy test.
The IUD can be inserted up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse for
emergency contraception. Women who receive the IUD under emergency
conditions often choose to maintain the IUD for contraception.

B. Less effective prevention of pregnancy
C. Less nausea
D. More liver dysfunction

290

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

ANSWERS
33.1

A. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is associated with loss of bone
mineral density particularly in adolescents. If it is the best type of
contraception for the patient, then the loss in bone mineral density
should not discourage the use of the agent, but it should be considered in the choice of the contraception agent.

33.2

C. Tension headaches are not a contraindication for oral contraceptive agents. Migraines with aura increase the risk of strokes in patient
who take combination hormonal contraception. Other contraindications to combination hormonal contraception include diabetes
with vascular disease, smoker over the age of 35, and uncontrolled
hypertension.

33.3

D. Oral contraceptives have many beneficial effects including decreasing the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer, decreasing the risk of
benign breast disease; there may be a slightly increased risk of breast
cancer. Gallstones incidence may also be slightly increased.

33.4

B. Because of the high dose of estrogens, nausea and vomiting are the
most common side effects.

33.5

B. Nulliparity is not a contraindication to IUD insertion.
Contraindications include pregnancy, current or recent history of
pelvic inflammatory disease, current sexually transmitted disease,
current or recent puerperal or postabortion sepsis, purulent cervicitis, undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding, malignancy of the genital tract, known uterine anomalies or fibroids distorting the uterine
cavity in a way incompatible with IUD insertion, or allergy to any
component of the IUD or Wilson disease.

33.6

C. As compared to the combination OC regimen, the progestin-only
method has better efficacy and fewer side effects (nausea). Thus, it is
the preferred method. Patients who are given the combination OC
agents usually require an antiemetic agent.

CLINICAL CASES

Clinical Pearls
➤ Emergency contraception is effective when initiated within 72 hours of
intercourse.
➤ Emergency contraception consists of high-dose combination hormones,
high-dose progestin, or insertion of an IUD.
➤ The main side effects of combination hormonal emergency contraception
therapy are nausea and vomiting.
➤ An advantage of IUD insertion is that it can be retained for continued longterm contraception.
➤ The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD can be used to improve bleeding profiles
in patients with dysfunctional uterine bleeding and menorrhagia.
➤ Nonuser-dependent methods like the IUD, DMPA, and the subdermal
implant, have the lowest failure rates.
➤ Oral contraceptives decrease the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer;
there may be a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. It decreases the
duration of menses and the amount of blood loss per cycle.
➤ Smoking over the age of 35 years is an absolute contraindication for combination oral contraceptives.
➤ Sickle cell crises and epilepsy occur less often with IMPA.
➤ The contraceptive patch may be associated with a greater risk of DVT.

ANSWER TO CASE 34:
Pyelonephritis, Unresponsive
Summary: A 20-year-old G1 P0 woman at 29 weeks’ gestation has received intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin for 48 hours for acute pyelonephritis. She
complains of acute shortness of breath. On examination, her HR is 100 bpm, RR
45 breaths per minute, and BP is 120/70. Right costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. The urine culture revealed E coli sensitive to ampicillin.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the clinical presentation of pyelonephritis.
2. Know that the primary treatment of pyelonephritis is intravenous antibiotic therapy.
3. Understand that endotoxins can cause pulmonary damage, leading to
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Considerations
This patient is 20 years old at 29 weeks’ gestation. She presented with
pyelonephritis. She had been treated with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. The diagnosis is confirmed since E coli has been cultured from the
urine. She is now presenting with dyspnea and tachypnea. The most likely
etiology for her respiratory symptoms is ARDS, with pulmonary injury due to
the endotoxin release. This typically occurs after antibiotics have begun to
lyse the bacteria, leading to endotoxemia. The endotoxins can induce damage to the myocardium, liver, and kidneys, as well as the lungs. The mechanism is leaky capillaries, which allows fluid from the intravascular space to
permeate into the alveolar areas. A chest film may show patchy infiltrates;
however, if the disease process is early, the chest radiograph may be normal.
Treatment would include oxygen supplementation, careful monitoring of fluids
(not to overload), and supportive measures. Occasionally, a patient may
require intubation, but usually the condition stabilizes and improves.

APPROACH TO
Pyelonephritis in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
PYELONEPHRITIS: Kidney parenchymal infection most commonly caused

by gram-negative aerobic bacteria, such as E coli.
ENDOTOXIN: A lipopolysaccharide that is released upon lysis of the cell wall
of bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria.
ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS): Alveolar and
endothelial injury leading to leaky pulmonary capillaries, clinically causing
hypoxemia, large alveolar-arterial gradient, and loss of lung volume.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pyelonephritis in pregnancy can be a very serious medical condition, with an incidence of 1% to 2% of all pregnancies. It is the most common cause of sepsis in
pregnant women. The patient generally complains of dysuria, urgency, frequency,
costovertebral tenderness, fever and chills, and nausea and vomiting. The urinalysis usually will reveal pyuria and bacteriuria; a urine culture revealing greater
than 100,000 colony-forming units/mL of a single uropathogen is diagnostic. The
most common organism is E coli, seen in about 80% of cases. Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus aureus, and Proteus mirabilis may also be isolated.
Pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis should be hospitalized and
given intravenous antibiotics. Cephalosporins, such as cefotetan or ceftriaxone, or the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin are usually effective.
The patient should be treated until the fever and flank tenderness have substantially improved and then switched to oral antimicrobial therapy, and then
suppressive therapy for the remainder of the pregnancy. Up to one-third of
pregnant women with pyelonephritis will develop a recurrent UTI if suppressive therapy is not utilized. A repeat urine culture should be obtained to
ensure eradication of the infection. If clinical improvement has not occurred
after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy, a urinary tract obstruction (ie, ureterolithiasis) or a perinephric abscess should be suspected.
Approximately 2% to 5% of pregnant women with pyelonephritis will
develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is defined as pulmonary injury due to sepsis, usually endotoxin related. The endotoxins derived
from the gram-negative bacterial cell wall enter the blood stream, especially
after antibiotic therapy, and may induce transient elevation of the serum creatinine as well as liver enzymes. Also, the endotoxemia may cause uterine
contractions and place a patient into preterm labor. Diffuse bilateral or interstitial infiltrates are typically seen on chest radiograph (Figure 34–1).

required to maintain adequate oxygen levels.

Comprehension Questions
34.1

A 36-year-old G1 P0 woman at 27 weeks’ gestation is noted to have
fever, right flank tenderness, and pyuria. She is diagnosed with
pyelonephritis. A urine culture is performed. Which of the following
is the most commonly isolated etiologic agent causing pyelonephritis
in pregnancy?
A. Proteus species
B. Candidal species
C. Escherichia coli
D. Klebsiella species

CLINICAL CASES

34.2

A 21-year-old G1 P0 woman at 15 weeks’ gestation is noted to have
fever of 101°F (38.3°C), BP of 80/40 mm Hg, and decreased urine output. She is noted to be in septic shock. Which of the following is the
most common cause of septic shock in pregnancy?
A. Pelvic inflammatory disease
B. Pyelonephritis
C. Wound infection
D. Mastitis

34.3

When a pregnant woman with pyelonephritis does not improve on
adequate antibiotic therapy for 48 hours and experiences continued
severe flank tenderness and fever, which of the following should be
next considered?
A. Obstruction of the urinary tract, such as by nephrolithiasis
B. Anaerobic organisms
C. Hemolytic uremic syndrome
D. Factitious fever

34.4

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is best identified by which of the following?
A. Careful questioning for dysuria or urinary frequency
B. Urine culture on the first prenatal visit
C. Urine culture at 35 weeks’ gestation
D. Urinalysis for any patient with family history of UTI

ANSWERS
34.1

C. Escherichia coli is the most commonly isolated bacteria in pyelonephritis. Proteus and Klebsiella may also be found, but they are not the most
common. Pregnant women with acute pyelonephritis should be hospitalized and given IV hydration and antibiotics. Cephalosporins, or the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin, are usually effective. The patient
should be treated with IV medicines until the fever and flank pain
resolve, and then switched to oral medication for the remainder of the
pregnancy. Candida species are more often associated with vaginitis and
not an infection associated with the urinary tract or kidneys.

34.2

B. Pyelonephritis is the most common cause of septic shock in pregnancy. Endotoxins derived from the gram-negative bacterial cell wall
enter the bloodstream, especially after antibiotic therapy, and may
induce transient elevation of serum creatinine as well as liver enzyme
levels. The endotoxemia may cause uterine contractions and place a
patient into preterm labor. Another complication that may arise is the
development of ARDS, pulmonary injury due to sepsis. Mastitis typically occurs postpartum and, though rare, if left untreated can lead to
abscess formation or sepsis. The agent most commonly responsible for
mastitis is S aureus, typically acquired from the back of the baby’s
throat during breast-feeding. An unattended wound infection can lead

298

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

to postpartum sepsis as well; especially after cesarean delivery. Pelvic
inflammatory disease typically does not lead to sepsis; however, if a
tubo-ovarian abscess forms and then ruptures, the patient is likely to
go into septic shock. This is a surgical emergency that could be fatal.
34.3

A. Urinary obstruction, such as with a stone, should be considered
with continued fever and flank tenderness after a 48- to 72-hour
course of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Pyelonephritis is typically
caused by aerobic bacteria such as E coli, Kebsiella, Proteus, and
Staphylococcus aureus. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disease characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure (uremia),
and thrombocytopenia, but is not associated with pyelonephritis;
however, like pyelonephritis, its etiology is usually due to E coli
(in HUS, a strain of E coli that expresses a Shiga-like toxin). Patients
typically present with bloody diarrhea rather than fever and flank
pain. Factitious fever is also not associated with pyelonephritis, since
the fever associated with this infection is legitimate.

34.4

B. Urine culture for every patient at the first prenatal visit helps to
identify asymptomatic bacteriuria. Treatment prevents sequelae such
as preterm labor and pyelonephritis during pregnancy. Careful questioning would not be of much use since the bacteriuria is asymptomatic. A urine culture at 35 weeks would not be helpful either; by
this point, the asymptomatic bacteria may have already led to unfavorable consequences such as preterm labor or pyelonephritis. It is
cost-effective and a good practice of preventative medicine for patients
to get a urinalysis at every prenatal visit, regardless of family history
which does not affect the likelihood of having bacteriuria.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of septic shock in pregnancy is pyelonephritis.
➤ When dyspnea occurs in a pregnant woman who is being treated for
pyelonephritis, ARDS should be considered.
➤ Endotoxin release from gram-negative bacteria is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with pyelonephritis.

ANSWER TO CASE 35:
Deep Venous Thrombosis in Pregnancy
Summary: A 31-year-old G1 P0 woman at 24 weeks’ gestation, who has been
walking slightly more than usual, complains of a 2-day history of right calf
soreness. On examination, her HR is 100 bpm and RR 12 breaths per minute.
Her heart and lung examinations are normal. The right calf is somewhat tender and slightly swollen. No palpable cords are present, and the Homans sign
is negative.
➤

Next step: Noninvasive assessment for a deep venous thrombosis of the
right leg.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know that pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state and predisposes to
thrombosis.
2. Know that the physical examination is not an accurate method to diagnose
deep venous thrombosis.
3. Know the diagnostic and therapeutic measures for deep venous thrombosis.

Considerations
This 31-year-old woman at 24 weeks’ gestation has been walking slightly more
than usual and complains of calf tenderness. The right calf is mildly tender
and swollen. These subtle findings are sufficient to warrant investigations for
a deep venous thrombosis. Because of the increased levels of clotting factors
(predominantly fibrinogen) and the venous stasis, pregnancy produces a
hypercoagulable state. The physical examination is not very sensitive or specific in the assessment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The Homans sign,
that is, dorsiflexion of the foot to attempt to elicit tenderness in the patient
is a poor test, and theoretically may itself cause embolization of clots. For
these reasons, many experts advise against the performance of this test.
Instead, a noninvasive test, such as Doppler flow studies of the venous system
of the affected lower extremity, is an appropriate method to assess for deep
venous thrombosis. If the Doppler flow test confirms a thrombosis, anticoagulation with an agent such as heparin should be initiated. In a nonpregnant
woman, venography would be an option, that is, injecting radiopaque dye into
a vein of the foot and taking radiographic images of the venous system.

301

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Deep Venous Thrombosis in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS: Deposit of a thrombus, platelet, and fibrin

in the deep veins usually of the lower extremity or pelvis.
DUPLEX ULTRASOUND FLOW STUDY: Ultrasound technique using both
real-time sonography and Doppler flow to assess for deep venous thrombosis.
PULMONARY EMBOLISM: When a fragment of the thrombus is dislodged
and migrates into the pulmonary arterial circulation.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Deep venous thrombosis occurs in slightly less than 1% of pregnancies. The
pregnant state increases the risk fivefold due to the venous stasis with the large
gravid uterus pressing on the vena cava and the hypercoagulable state due to
the increase in clotting factors. Cesarean delivery further increases the risk of
DVT. Whereas clots involving the superficial venous system pose virtually no
danger and may be treated with analgesia, deep venous thrombosis is associated
with pulmonary embolism in 40% of untreated cases. The risk of death is
increased tenfold when pulmonary embolism is unrecognized and untreated.
Therefore, early diagnosis and anticoagulation treatment are crucial.
Signs and symptoms of DVT include “muscle pain,” deep linear cords of the
calf, and tenderness and swelling of the lower extremity. A 2-cm difference in
leg circumferences is also sometimes helpful. Unfortunately, none of these
findings are very specific for DVT, and in fact, the examination is normal in
half of the cases of DVT. Hence, imaging tests are necessary for confirmation.
In pregnancy, the diagnostic test of choice is Doppler ultrasound imaging,
which usually employs a 5 to 7.5 MHz Doppler transducer to measure venous
blood flow with and without compression of the deep veins. This modality
is nearly as sensitive and specific as the time-honored method of contrast
venography.
Management of deep venous thrombosis is primarily anticoagulation with
bed rest and extremity elevation. During pregnancy, heparin is usually preferable over Coumadin, since Coumadin may cause congenital abnormalities
and is more difficult to reverse. Heparin, which is a potent thrombin inhibitor
that blocks conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, combines with antithrombin III.
It stabilizes the clot and inhibits its propagation. After full intravenous anticoagulation therapy for 5 to 7 days, the therapy is generally switched to subcutaneous therapy to maintain the aPTT at 1.5 to 2.5 times control for at least
3 months after the acute event. After 3 months, either full heparinization or

302

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

“prophylactic heparinization” can be utilized for the remainder of the pregnancy and for 6 weeks postpartum (see Case 22).

E. Prostaglandin compounds

CLINICAL CASES

303

ANSWERS
35.1

A. Venous stasis is one of the main factors contributing to the hypercoagulable state in pregnancy. Venous stasis is present due to the
uterus compressing the vena cava. Usually, the platelet count is
slightly lower in the pregnant state. The lower limit of normal is
150,000/mm3 in the nonpregnant patient and 120,000/mm3 in the
pregnant woman. There is an increased level of clotting factors in
pregnancy, and this along with venous stasis are the two factors that
increase the risk of DVT in a pregnant woman fivefold. Endothelial
damage is associated with the development of hypertension and not
a hypercoagulable state in pregnancy.

35.2

A. Heparin is a large, charged glycoprotein that does not cross the placenta very well; therefore, it is safer to use during pregnancy instead of
Coumadin, which may lead to congenital abnormalities and is more
difficult to reverse. Osteoporosis (anticoagulants have a propensity to
inhibit vitamin K, which is involved in bone metabolism) and thrombocytopenia (not thrombophilia) are long-term complications of
heparin use. Heparin is not known to cause diabetes mellitus.

35.3

B. The most common locations of DVT associated with gynecologic
surgery are the lower extremities and the pelvic veins. The Virchow
triad (ie, stasis, hypercoagulability, intimal injury) is a model used to
explain the increased risk of developing a DVT during the perioperative period. The patient is usually left in a supine position during this
period; this, along with the vasodilating effects of the anesthesia contributes to the “stasis” component of the triad. Because the body recognizes blood loss during a surgery, patients typically tend to become
hypercoagulable as well since an increased number of clotting factors
are produced in an attempt to stop the bleeding from surgery. Vascular
wall injury can occur from the excessive vasodilation caused by the
anesthesia, and any injury to blood vessels leads to an accumulation of
clotting factors at the site of injury. Also, the longer the surgery, the
higher the risk of developing a DVT. The lower extremities and pelvic
veins are at an increased susceptibility to DVTs due to the increased
diameter of the veins and more “sluggish” flow of blood in this region.

35.4

C. The estrogen in the combination oral contraceptive is slightly
thrombogenic and may be contraindicated in a woman with a prior
DVT. All of the other answer choices are progestin-only methods of
contraception, and progesterone is not considered thrombogenic.
Progestin-only contraception is contraindicated in women with unexplained uterine bleeding. Reason being, progestin-only methods are
associated with irregular uterine bleeding which consists of amenorrhea, breakthrough bleeding, irregular spotting, and prolonged periods
of amenorrhea or menorrhagia. This would make a pathological diagnosis more obscure.

is 120/74 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) 80 beats per minute (bpm), and she
is afebrile. Her thyroid is normal on palpation. Her heart and lung
examinations are normal. The breast examination shows a 1.5-cm,
mobile, nontender mass of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.
No adenopathy or skin changes are appreciated. Mammography and
ultrasound examinations of the breasts are normal.

ANSWER TO CASE 36:
Dominant Breast Mass
Summary: A 50-year-old postmenopausal woman comes in for a well-woman
examination. The breast examination shows a 1.5-cm, mobile, nontender
mass of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. No adenopathy or skin
changes are appreciated. Mammography and ultrasound examinations of the
breasts are normal.
➤

Next step: Excisional biopsy of the breast mass, or stereotactic core needle
biopsy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that any three-dimensional dominant breast mass requires tissue for histologic analysis.
2. Understand that the age of the patient is usually the biggest risk factor for
breast cancer.
3. Understand that normal imaging of a palpable breast mass does not rule
out cancer.

Considerations
This 50-year-old woman came in for a well-woman examination. The physical
examination is aimed at screening for common and/or serious conditions, such
as hypertension, thyroid disease, cervical cancer (Pap smear), colon cancer
(stool for occult blood), and breast cancer. A single 1.5-cm breast mass is palpated, but there are no associated skin changes, such as nipple retraction or
dimpling of the skin. There is no associated adenopathy. Furthermore, the imaging tests (mammography and ultrasonography) are normal. Despite the normal
imaging, there is a possibility that the breast mass is malignant. Therefore,
biopsy of the mass is indicated. Because of the patient’s age, removal of the
entire mass (excisional biopsy) is preferable over fine needle aspiration. Fine
needle aspiration may miss a malignancy, and at this patient’s age, leaving a
mass in the breast would make future examinations more difficult.

CLINICAL CASES

307

APPROACH TO
Breast Masses
DEFINITIONS
DOMINANT BREAST MASS: A three-dimensional mass that, on palpation,
is felt to be separate from the remainder of the breast tissue.
EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: Surgical procedure removing the entire mass.
SKIN DIMPLING: Retraction of the skin, which is suspicious for an underlying malignancy, due to the cancer being fixed to the skin.
BRCA GENE MUTATIONS: BRCA1 gene is located on chromosome 17 and
BRCA2 gene is located on chromosome 13. These are tumor suppressor
genes, such that a mutation in the gene confers a markedly increased risk of
breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It is the second leading
cause of female cancer deaths, exceeded only by lung cancer. The prevalence
of breast cancer is age specific and age is the most important risk factor. One
in 2500 women will develop breast cancer at the age of 20 years; whereas 1 in
30 women will develop breast cancer at the age of 60 years, giving an overall
lifetime risk of 1 in 8. Other risk factors include a family history of mammary
cancer, especially of premenopausal onset.
Early diagnosis improves survival. The most common way that breast cancer is first discovered is a mass palpated by the patient. Unfortunately, this frequently occurs at an advanced stage. Routine screening is preferable. Monthly
self-breast examination and clinical breast examination every 3 years should be
performed for women from ages 20 to 39 years. Women over the age of 40 years
should perform a monthly self-breast examination, and have a yearly clinical
breast examination; some experts advocate mammography every 2 years
between the ages of 40 to 49 years. Annual mammography should be initiated
at age 50 years, but may be performed sooner if risk factors warrant the need.
Mammograms carry a false-negative rate of up to 10%. Thus, any palpable
dominant mass, regardless of mammographic findings, requires histologic diagnosis. The type of biopsy will vary depending on the risk of cancer. For example,
a young woman with a clinical examination consistent with a fibroadenoma may
have a fine needle aspiration; in contrast, a woman aged 50 years, at greater risk
for malignancy due to age, will usually have an excisional biopsy. The greater the
risk for cancer, the more the tissue that should be sampled.

308

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

If a mammogram detects a suspicious lesion, a biopsy is usually performed.
For nonpalpable lesions, the biopsy requires needle-localization excisional
biopsy or stereotactic core needle biopsy.
A patient who has two first-degree relatives with breast cancer is a candidate for genetic testing, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing. Patients of
Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are specially of increased risk. A mutation of the
BRCA1 gene is associated with a 50% to 70% risk of breast cancer, and a 30%
risk of ovarian cancer. The risks with BRCA2 are slightly lower. Identification
of these risks also allow for risk reduction medications and possibly surgery such
as bilateral mastectomy or prophylactic oophorectomy after child-bearing.

Comprehension Questions
36.1

A 36-year-old woman is noted to have a 2-cm palpable breast mass
noted on physical examination. A mammogram is performed suggestive of a cyst. Ultrasound confirms a cystic mass. A fine needle aspiration is performed with 8 cc of blood-colored fluid obtained. The mass
is no longer palpable. Which of the following is the next best step for
this patient?
A. Expectant management as the prognosis is excellent
B. Send the fluid for cytology
C. Lumpectomy and lymph node dissection
D. Tamoxifen therapy

36.2

A 26-year-old woman is referred to genetic counseling for her mother
who died from breast cancer, and her sister with breast cancer. The
patient is noted to have a BRCA1 mutation. Which of the following
best describes the genetic transmission of this disorder?
A. Autosomal dominant
B. Autosomal recessive
C. X-linked dominant
D. X-linked recessive

36.3

A 49-year-old woman is noted to have a 1.5 cm mass of the right breast.
It is nontender and there are no skin changes or adenopathy. The mammogram is negative, and the ultrasound likewise is normal. An excisional biopsy reveals an infiltrating intraductal carcinoma. Which of the
following would most significantly impact on the patient’s prognosis?
A. Hormone receptor status
B. Lymph node status
C. Size of the primary cancer
D. Presence of skin changes

CLINICAL CASES

309

ANSWERS
36.1

B. When the fluid obtained from a breast cyst is straw-colored and
the mass disappears, then the fluid can be discarded and no further
therapy is needed. However, when the fluid is a different color such
as bloody, then the fluid should be sent for cytology. Lumpectomy
and lymph node dissection is performed for proven breast cancer for
staging. Tamoxifen therapy is used for postmenopausal women with
breast cancer after surgical staging.

36.2

A. A mutation to one BRCA gene is associated with an increased
risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Thus, this is an autosomal dominant disorder. Half the offsprings would be affected, and both sexes
would be equally affected.

36.3

B. The patient’s lymph node status is the most significant impact on
the patient’s prognosis. Hormone receptor status does play some role
but not as significantly as the lymph node condition. Infiltrating
intraductal carcinoma is the most common histological subtype of
breast cancer. The size of the primary tumor likewise does play a role.
Optimally, the smaller the tumor, the better the survival.

Clinical Pearls
➤ A three-dimensional dominant breast mass must be biopsied, regardless
of the imaging results.
➤ Early detection of breast cancer leads to better survival.
➤ In general, the biggest risk factor for the development of breast cancer is
age.
➤ Two first-degree family members with breast cancer suggest a familial syndrome, such as mediated by the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.
➤ Women at the age of 35 years or greater with a family history of breast cancer should have annual mammography.
➤ The most common cause of unilateral serosanguineous nipple discharge
from a single duct is intraductal papilloma.
➤ Infiltrating intraductal carcinoma is the most common histological type of
breast cancer.
➤ A breast cyst in which the fluid is straw-colored or clear and the breast
mass upon aspiration disappears may be observed.
➤ Upon aspiration of a breast cyst, fluid that is other than straw-colored
should be sent for cytology, and a mass that persists after aspiration should
be biopsied.

ovarian tumors in women younger than 30 years.
2. Understand that dermoid cysts sometimes contain thyroid tissue and cause
hyperthyroidism.
3. Know that surgical therapy is the treatment of choice for ovarian tumors.
4. Understand how to evaluate and manage adnexal masses in the various age
groups.

Considerations
This 22-year-old woman has symptoms of hyperthyroidism with weight loss,
palpitations, and nervousness. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in
the United States is Graves disease, but the patient has no history of thyroid
disease and her thyroid is normal to palpation. A patient with Graves disease
usually will have a nontender goiter, and many times eye-related symptoms
(proptosis or lid lag). She has an ovarian mass, which on sonography is noted
to be complex, that is, to have both solid and cystic components. There is no
mention of ascites in the maternal abdomen; the presence of ascites would be
consistent with ovarian cancer. In a young woman (<30 years of age) with a
unilateral complex ovarian mass, the most likely diagnosis is a cystic teratoma, or dermoid cyst. These tumors sometimes contain thyroid tissue and
may cause hyperthyroidism. The treatment of choice for ovarian neoplasms is
exploratory laparotomy with ovarian cystectomy, if benign, or more extensive
surgery if malignant. At the time of surgery, the excised cyst is sent for frozen
section to determine if it is benign (no further surgery needed) or malignant
(surgical staging needed).

APPROACH TO
Adnexal Masses
DEFINITIONS
CYSTIC TERATOMA: A benign germ cell tumor that may contain all three

germ cell layers.
STRUMA OVARII: Benign cystic teratoma containing thyroid tissue, which

can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
OVARIAN NEOPLASM: An abnormal growth (either benign or malignant)

of the ovary; most will not regress.
EPITHELIAL OVARIAN TUMOR: Neoplasm arising from the outer layer of
the ovary, which can imitate the other epithelium of the gynecologic or urologic system. This is the most common type of ovarian malignancy, usually
occurring in older women.
FUNCTIONAL OVARIAN CYST: Physiologic cysts of the ovary, which occur in
reproductive-aged women, of follicular, corpus luteal, or theca lutein in origin.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Germ Cell Tumors
Germ cell tumors (Table 37–1) represent about one-quarter of all ovarian
tumors, and are the second most frequent type of ovarian neoplasms. They are
found mainly in young women, usually in the second and third decade of life.
The most common tumor is the benign cystic teratoma (dermoid). A germ
cell malignancy usually presents as a pelvic mass and causes pain due to its
rapidly enlarging size. Because of these symptoms, 60% to 70% of patients
present at stage I, limited to one or both ovaries.

Teratomas
Mature benign cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts) constitute over 95% of all
ovarian teratomas. They make up 15% to 25% of all ovarian tumors, especially in the second and third decades of life. The most common elements are
ectodermal derivatives such as skin, hair follicles, and sebaceous or sweat
glands. However, they can also contain tissues of the three embryonic layers,
including mesoderm and endoderm. They are usually multicystic and contain
hair intermixed with foul-smelling, sticky, keratinaceous and sebaceous
debris. Although most are unilateral, they can appear bilaterally 10% to 15%
of the time. Ultrasound features of dermoid cysts include a hypoechoic area or
echoic band-like strand in a hypoechoic medium or the appearance of a cystic structure with a fat fluid level. Ultrasound is generally very accurate in the
diagnosis of dermoid cysts. Torsion is the most frequent complication, with
severe acute abdominal pain as the typical initial symptom. This is more commonly seen during pregnancy and the puerperium. Torsion is also more common in children and younger patients. Rupture is an uncommon complication
and presents as shock or hemorrhage. A chemical peritonitis can be caused by
the spill of the contents of the tumor into the peritoneal cavity. The treatment is usually a cystectomy or unilateral oophorectomy with inspection of
the contralateral ovary.
Immature teratomas contain all three germ layers, as well as immature or
embryonal structures. They are uncommon and comprise less than 1% of
ovarian cancers. They occur primarily in the first and second decades of life
and are basically unknown after menopause. Malignant teratomas contain
immature neural elements and that quantity alone determines the grade.
They are almost always unilateral. The prognosis is directly related to the
stage and the cellular immaturity. The treatment is a unilateral salpingooophorectomy with wide sampling of peritoneal implants. If the primary
tumor is grade 1 and all peritoneal implants are grade 0, no further treatment
is warranted. However, if the primary tumor is grade 2 or 3 and if there are
implants or recurrences, combination chemotherapy is usually effective.

Struma Ovarii
Struma ovarii is a teratoma in which thyroid tissue has overgrown the other
elements. They are usually unilateral, occurring more frequently in the right
adnexa, and generally measure less than 10 cm in diameter. Preoperative clinical or radiologic diagnosis is very difficult. Only rarely will patients develop
thyrotoxicosis. On MRI, these tumors appear as complex multilobulated
masses with thick septa, thought to represent multiple large thyroid follicles.
Most of these tumors are benign, but about 10% can have malignant changes.
They will rarely produce sufficient thyroid hormone to induce hyperthyroidism. The treatment is usually cystectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy.

Epithelial Tumors
The most common ovarian tumors in women over the age of 30 years are
of epithelial origin (Table 37–2).
The serous subtype is most common and more often bilateral. Mucinous
tumors are characterized by their large size, and if ruptured may lead to
pseudomyxoma peritonei, in which the mucinous material spills out into the
intra-abdominal cavity. Endometrioid tumors of the ovary may coexist with a
primary endometrial carcinoma of the uterus. The treatment of epithelial
tumors is surgical, and if malignancy is confirmed, cancer staging is indicated.
Treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer involves combination chemotherapy
following surgical staging. Malignant ascites is common with cancer, as is
spread to the small bowel and omentum. Lymphatic extension may also be
seen. The tumor marker cancer antigen (CA)-125 is elevated in most epithelial ovarian tumors, and is more specific in postmenopausal women, since a
variety of diseases during the reproductive years can elevate the CA-125
level.

Adnexal Masses
The evaluation of adnexal masses is guided by the suspicion of neoplasm
(benign or malignant). At the extremes of ages, there are few functional ovarian cysts and the management is straightforward (Table 37–3).
During the reproductive years, functional ovarian cysts, such as follicular
and corpus luteal cysts, sometimes make the evaluation difficult. In general,
any adnexal mass greater than 8 cm in size is likely to be a tumor and should
be explored. Any adnexal mass less than 5 cm in size suggests a functional
cyst. Between 5 and 8 cm, the sonographic features may help to distinguish
functional versus neoplasm. Septations, solid components, or excrescences
(growth on surface or inner lining) are consistent with a neoplastic process,
whereas a simple cyst is more suggestive of a functional cyst. Sometimes, a
practitioner will choose to observe an adnexal mass that is between 5 and 8 cm
in size for 1 month and operate if it is persistent.

Which of the following is the most likely cell type?
A. Dermoid cyst
B. Granulosa cell tumor
C. Serous tumor
D. Mucinous tumor

ANSWERS
37.1

E. This is a young child with precocious puberty, which suggests an
estrogen-secreting tumor. This is most likely a granulosa-theca cell
tumor, best treated by surgery. These are stromal sex cord tumors.

37.2

A. When the ovarian cyst in the reproductive-aged female is less
than 5 cm in diameter, the most likely cause is a physiologic cyst
such as a follicular cyst or corpus luteum. Expectant management
and reassessment in 1 to 2 months is the best next step.

37.3

C. Ovarian cystectomy is the best treatment for benign cystic teratomas.

37.4

A. Granulosa cell tumors and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are usually solid
on ultrasound, and may secrete sex hormones. Typically, granulosa-theca
cell tumors produce estrogens, whereas Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors make
androgens.

37.5

C. Benign cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts) are complex cysts since they
usually have both solid and cystic components. The best treatment of a
dermoid in a young woman is ovarian cystectomy. Ovarian torsion is
the most frequent complication. Immature teratomas contain all three
germ layers, as well as immature or embryonal structures. Malignant teratomas contain immature neural elements, and the grade of the tumor
is determined by the amount of neural tissue involved.

37.6

B. Follicular cysts are generally simple cysts without septations or
solid parts. They are among the physiologic cysts of the ovary, which
occur in reproductive-aged women. Other physiologic, or functional,
cysts include corpus luteal or theca lutein cysts.

318
37.7

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

D. Mucinous tumors of the ovary can grow to be very large. If they
rupture intra-abdominally, they may cause pseudomyxoma peritonei,
which leads to repeated bouts of bowel obstruction. They are of
epithelial origin. The most common type of epithelial ovarian tumor
is the serous type, which unlike the mucinous tumors, occurs bilaterally. The tumor marker CA-125 is elevated in most epithelial ovarian tumors and is more specific in postmenopausal women because a
variety of diseases that occur during the reproductive years can show
an elevated CA-125 level.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common ovarian tumor in a woman younger than 30 years is a
benign cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst). The best treatment of a dermoid in
a young woman is ovarian cystectomy.
➤ The most common ovarian tumor in a woman older than 30 years is
epithelial in origin, most commonly serous cystadenoma.
➤ An ovarian mass larger than 5 cm in a postmenopausal woman most likely
represents an ovarian tumor and should generally be removed. An ovarian
mass that is larger than 2 to 3 cm in a prepubertal girl likewise should be
investigated and many times requires removal.
➤ During the reproductive years, functional ovarian cysts are common and
are usually smaller than 5 cm in diameter. Any ovarian cyst larger than
8 cm in a reproductive-aged woman is probably a neoplasm and should
be excised.
➤ The tumor marker CA-125 is most specific for ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women.
➤ Mucinous tumors of the ovary can grow to be very large. If they rupture
intra-abdominally, they may cause pseudomyxoma peritonei, which leads
to repeated bouts of bowel obstruction.
➤ Ascites is a common sign of ovarian malignancy.
➤ Ovarian cancer staging consists of total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, peritoneal biopsies, peritoneal
washings or sampling of ascitic fluid, and lymphadenectomy.

Case 38
A 45-year-old woman complains of profuse serosanguineous drainage
from her abdominal incision site that has persisted over 4 hours and has
soaked several large towels. The patient states that the incision had
been somewhat red and tender for several days. She had staging surgery
for ovarian cancer 7 days previously. She denies the passage of blood
clots or foul smelling lochia. She states that her vaginal bleeding was
scant. Her past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and her surgical history is unremarkable. On examination, her weight is
270 lb, blood pressure (BP) is 100/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) 80 beats
per minute, respiratory rate (RR) 12 breaths per minute, and she is
afebrile. The thyroid is normal to palpation. The heart and lung examinations are normal. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable except for the abdominal incision.

ANSWERS TO CASE 38:
Fascial Disruption
Summary: A 45-year-old obese woman complains of a 4-hour history of profuse serosanguineous drainage from her abdominal incision site. She had
undergone staging surgery for ovarian cancer 7 days previously.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Surgical site infection (deep incisional) with fascial disruption.

➤

Most appropriate therapy: Immediate surgical closure and broadspectrum antibiotic therapy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the classic presentation of surgical site infection (SSI) with fascial
disruption.
2. Understand that both fascial disruption and fascial evisceration are surgical emergencies.
3. Know the risk factors for wound disruptions.

Considerations
This 45-year-old diabetic woman underwent ovarian cancer staging surgery 7 days
previously. She now complains of 4 hours of profuse and continuous serosanguineous drainage from her abdominal incision. This is the typical presentation for fascial disruption. Because the rectus fascia is interrupted, the
peritoneal fluid escapes through the wound. If this were only a superficial fascial separation, caused by a seroma or other small fluid collection in the subcutaneous fat tissue, then the patient would have only complained of a limited
amount of drainage. The patient does not have intestinal contents penetrating
through the incision; thus, an evisceration is not suspected. Nevertheless, deep
SSI with fascial disruptions is a surgical emergency requiring immediate surgical repair. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is usually administered. This
patient has numerous risk factors for fascial dehiscence including obesity,
diabetes, cancer, and a probable vertical incision. The time frame from the surgery is fairly typical, which is usually 7 to 10 days following surgery.

CLINICAL CASES

323

APPROACH TO
Wound Complications
DEFINITIONS
WOUND DEHISCENCE: A separation of part of the surgical incision, but

with an intact peritoneum.
FASCIAL DISRUPTION: Separation of the fascial layer, usually leading to a
communication of the peritoneal cavity with the skin.
SEROSANGUINEOUS: Blood-tinged drainage.
EVISCERATION: A disruption of all layers of the incision with omentum or
bowel protruding through the incision.
SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (SSI): Infection related to the operative procedure that occurs at or near the surgical incision within 30 days of an operation. Deep incision must involve the deep soft tissue such as fascia or muscle.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Wound Disorders
Wound complications include superficial separation, dehiscence, and evisceration. Separations of the subcutaneous tissue anterior to the fascia are usually
associated with infection or hematoma. They affect about 3% to 5% of abdominal hysterectomy incisions. The affected patient usually presents with a red,
tender, indurated incision and fever 4 to 10 days postoperatively. The treatment
is opening the wound and draining the purulence. A broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent is recommended, with wet-to-dry dressing changes. The wound
may be allowed to close secondarily, or be approximated after several days.
Fascial disruption, separation of the fascia but not the peritoneum, occurs in
about 1% of all abdominal surgeries, and about 0.5% of abdominal incisions.
It is more common with vertical incisions, obesity, intra-abdominal distension,
diabetes, exposure to radiation, corticosteroid use, infection, coughing, and malnutrition. This condition often presents as profuse drainage from the incision 5
to 14 days after surgery. SSI with fascial disruption requires repair as soon as possible with the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Evisceration is defined as protrusion of bowel or omentum through the
incision, which connotes complete separation of all layers of the wound. This
condition carries a significant mortality due to sepsis, and is considered a surgical emergency. When encountered, a sterile sponge wet with saline should
be placed over the bowel, and the patient taken to the operating room.
Antibiotics should be immediately started. The presentation is similar to that
of wound dehiscence.

A 59-year-old woman who had staging surgery for ovarian cancer is
noted to have clear serous drainage from her incision. The surgeon is
concerned that it may represent lymphatic drainage versus a fistula
from the urinary tract. Which of the following studies of the fluid
would most likely help to differentiate between these two entities?
A. Creatinine level
B. Leukocyte count
C. pH
D. Hemoglobin level
E. CA-125 level

and lower abdominal pain. On examination, she is noted to have a
temperature of 100.8°F (38.22°C) and the Pfannenstiel (low transverse) incision is red, indurated, and tender. Which of the following is
the best therapy for this condition?
A. Oral antibiotic therapy
B. Observation
C. Opening the incision and draining the infection
D. Antibiotic ointment to the affected area
E. Interferon therapy

CLINICAL CASES

325

ANSWERS
38.1

A. Diabetes is associated with an increased risk for fascial separation
because it is more difficult for wounds to heal in patients with this disease. The integrity of blood vessels is disrupted in a wound; this, along
with the fact that diabetics typically have poor blood circulation,
makes it more difficult to adequately profuse the wounded area (blood
contains the necessary clotting factors and immunoglobulins required
to heal a wound and prevent infection). As a result, diabetics are also
at a greater risk for a serious infection. A vertical incision as opposed
to a transverse incision is associated with a greater risk of fascial disruption. Addison disease is a state of hypocortisolism, whereas
Cushing disease is a state of hypercortisolism. Since increased cortisol
levels are associated with immunosuppression, wound dehiscence
would be more likely to occur in Cushing disease, not Addison disease.

38.2

C. Fascial breakdown (disruption) is not usually due to suture breakage or knot slippage, but rather due to the suture tearing through the
fascia. It is more common with vertical incisions, obesity, intraabdominal distension, diabetes, exposure to radiation, corticosteroid
use, infection, coughing, and malnutrition. This condition requires
immediate repair and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Fascial disruption
and evisceration typically occur between 5 and 14 days postoperatively.

38.3

A. A creatinine level may distinguish between urine and lymphatic
fluid. The creatinine level would be significantly more elevated in
urine.

38.4

C. This patient has a superficial wound infection. The best treatment
is to open the wound and drain the purulence. A broad-spectrum
antimicrobial agent is recommended, with wet-to-dry dressing
changes. The wound can be allowed to close secondarily or be approximated after several days. Observation in the face of infection would
not be the best management and may lead to septicemia. Ointments
and oral antibiotic therapy are not sufficient treatment options until
the drainage is removed.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Fascial disruption is a concern when copious amounts of sero-sanguinous
fluid are draining from an abdominal incision.

➤ The most common time period in which fascial disruption or evisceration
occurs is 5 to 14 days postoperatively.
➤ A superficial wound separation usually occurs due to infection or
hematoma, and is treated by opening the wound and using wet-to-dry
dressing changes.

ANSWERS TO CASE 39:
Abdominal Pain in Pregnancy (Ruptured Corpus
Luteum)
Summary: A 25-year-old woman at 10 weeks’ gestation complains of severe
abdominal pain and lightheadedness. Yesterday, she had moderately heavy
vaginal bleeding and passed some tissue, which floats with a “frond” pattern.
Her BP is 90/60 mm Hg, HR 120 bpm, and temperature 99°F (37.2°C). Her
abdomen is diffusely tender, distended, with rebound tenderness, and a fluid
wave is present. The cervix is closed.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Ruptured corpus luteum cyst with hemoperitoneum.

➤

Next step in the management: Admission to the hospital with surgical
intervention (laparoscopy or laparotomy).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the symptoms and signs of hypovolemic shock.
2. Know that a hemoperitoneum in pregnancy is usually caused by a ruptured
ectopic pregnancy and, less commonly, by a ruptured corpus luteum.
3. Understand that endometrial tissue that floats with a “frond pattern” is
almost always diagnostic for an intrauterine pregnancy.

Considerations
This 25-year-old woman is at 10 weeks’ gestation and complains of symptoms
of hypovolemia. She feels faint, is hypotensive, and has tachycardia. This
symptom complex is consistent with hemorrhagic shock. Furthermore, she
has severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, rebound tenderness, and a
positive fluid wave. The most likely cause is a hemoperitoneum. The blood in
the abdomen causes irritation of the peritoneal lining, causing the rebound
tenderness. In nine out of ten cases, a pregnant woman with a hemoperitoneum has an ectopic pregnancy. However, in this case, the patient passed
some tissue, which floated in a “frond pattern” when placed in saline. This is
very good evidence of products of conception; in fact, the float test is more
than 95% accurate for the presence of chorionic villi. An ectopic pregnancy
coexisting with an intrauterine pregnancy is exceedingly rare (1 in 10,000).
Thus, the hemoperitoneum is likely caused by a ruptured corpus luteum.
Another less common possibility includes splenic injury or rupture.

329

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Hypovolemia in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
CORPUS LUTEUM: A physiologic ovarian cyst formed from mature graafian

follicles following ovulation, which secretes progesterone.
HEMORRHAGIC CORPUS LUTEUM: Bleeding occurring in a corpus

luteum, which may cause a hemoperitoneum or cyst enlargement.
HEMOPERITONEUM: A collection of blood in the peritoneal cavity. The
blood initially clots and then lyses, so that there may be a combination of
clots and hemorrhagic fluid that will not clot.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Corpus luteum cysts develop from mature Graafian follicles and are associated
with normal endocrine function or prolonged secretion of progesterone. They
are usually less than 3 cm in diameter. There can be intrafollicular bleeding
because of thin-walled capillaries that invade the granulosa cells from the
theca interna. When the hemorrhage is excessive, the cyst can enlarge and
there is an increased risk of rupture. Cysts tend to rupture more during pregnancy, probably due to the increased incidence and friability of corpus lutea in
pregnancy. Anticoagulation therapy also predisposes to cyst rupture, and these
women should receive medication to prevent ovulation. Patients with hemorrhagic corpus lutea usually present with the sudden onset of severe lower
abdominal pain. This presentation is especially common in women with a
hemoperitoneum. Some women will complain of unilateral cramping and
lower abdominal pain for 1 to 2 weeks before overt rupture. Corpus luteum
cysts rupture more commonly between days 20 and 26 of the menstrual cycle.
The differential diagnosis of a suspected hemorrhagic corpus luteum should
include ectopic pregnancy, ruptured endometrioma, adnexal torsion, appendicitis, and splenic injury or rupture. Ultrasound examination may show free
intraperitoneal fluid, and perhaps fluid around an ovary. The diagnosis is confirmed by laparoscopy. The first step in the treatment of a ruptured corpus
luteal cyst is to secure hemostasis. Once the bleeding stops, no further therapy is required; if the bleeding continues, however, a cystectomy should be
performed with preservation of the remaining normal portion of ovary.
Progesterone is largely produced by the corpus luteum until about 10 weeks’
gestation. Until approximately the seventh week, the pregnancy is dependent
on the progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum. Human chorionic
gonadotropin serves to maintain the luteal function until placental steroidogenesis is established. There is shared function between the placenta and corpus luteum from the seventh to tenth week; after 10 weeks, the placenta

330

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

emerges as the major source of progesterone. Therefore, if the corpus luteum
is removed surgically prior to 10 to 12 weeks’ gestation, exogenous progesterone is needed to sustain the pregnancy. If the corpus luteum is excised after
10 to 12 weeks’ gestation, no supplemental progesterone is required.

A 20-year-old woman is brought into the emergency room with a
blood pressure of 70/40 mm Hg and heart rate of 130 bpm, and a history of heavy vaginal bleeding. Which of the following describes the
first step in treatment?
A. Intravenous isotonic fluids
B. Aggressive oral fluids
C. Immediate blood transfusion
D. Immediate uterine curettage
E. Intravenous dobutamine therapy

ANSWERS
39.1

D. Fibroids of the uterus can be associated with red or carneous
degeneration during pregnancy due to the estrogen levels leading to
rapid growth of the fibroid. The fibroid outgrows its blood supply
leading to ischemia and pan. Typically, the pain of a degenerating
fibroid is localized over the leiomyoma. Abruption can be concealed
with bleeding behind the placenta. The gallbladder usually does not
move during pregnancy, whereas the appendix will move superiorly
and laterally. Ovarian torsion is associated with colicky abdominal
pain and comes and goes.

39.2

D. With no chorionic villi on uterine curettage (therefore, unlikely
to be an intrauterine pregnancy or spontaneous abortion) and a
human chorionic gonadotropin level of 1800 mIU/mL, the most
likely diagnosis is an ectopic pregnancy. Molar pregnancies are associated with a rapid rise in the human chorionic gonadotropin level,
and will reveal hydropic villi on dilation and curettage (D and C).
Spontaneous abortion if completed prior to the D and C is a possibility; however, the patient does not complain of bleeding or passage
of tissue.

39.3

E. Renal blood flow is decreased with early hypovolemia as reflected
by decreased urine output. This is a compensatory mechanism to
make blood volume available to the body. Typically before tachycardia or hypotension occurs, a positive tilt test is noted. By the time
hypotension is noted at rest in a young, healthy patient, 30% of
blood volume is lost.

39.4

A. The priorities in treating any patient are the ABCs. Since the
patient’s airway and breathing are normal, then attention should be
paid to circulatory status. Stabilizing the patient with isotonic intravenous fluid infusion is the first step to resuscitation of the patient
with hypovolemia. Aggressive oral fluids are not absorbed fast
enough, plus the patient may not be coherent enough to intake fluids.
For a blood transfusion, it would take too long to retrieve the

332

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

patient’s blood type and get the appropriate blood products, plus it
takes longer to infuse a patient with blood than it does to infuse with
IV fluids. A uterine curettage would not be indicated because the
source of the bleed has not been identified and it still would not
make up for the volume that has already been lost.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of hemoperitoneum in early pregnancy is
ectopic pregnancy.
➤ A ruptured corpus luteum can mimic an ectopic pregnancy.
➤ Hemorrhagic corpus lutea can occur more commonly in patients with
bleeding tendencies either congenital (von Willebrand) or iatrogenic
(Coumadin induced).
➤ Nonclotted blood obtained from culdocentesis is consistent with intraabdominal hemorrhage.
➤ When the corpus luteum is excised in a pregnancy of less than 10 to 12 weeks
gestation, progesterone should be supplemented.
➤ The first sign of hypovolemia is oliguria (decreased urine output).
➤ By the time hypotension at rest is noted in a young, healthy patient, 30%
to 40% of the patient’s blood volume is lost.

ANSWERS TO CASE 40:
Amenorrhea (Intrauterine Adhesions)
Summary: A 33-year-old woman complains of 7 months of amenorrhea after
she had a D and C for a spontaneous abortion. Her menstrual history was normal previously. The thyroid, pelvic, and breast examinations are normal. The
pregnancy test is negative.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome).

➤

Next diagnostic test: Hysterosalpingogram (or hysteroscopy).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the definition of secondary amenorrhea.
2. Understand how uterine curettage can cause endometrial adhesions and
amenorrhea.
3. Know how to diagnose intrauterine adhesive disease (Asherman syndrome).

Considerations
This 33-year-old woman has had 7 months of amenorrhea since experiencing
a miscarriage. She had undergone a uterine dilation and curettage at that
time. Her menstrual history was unremarkable previously; hence, she meets
the definition of secondary amenorrhea (6 months of no menses in a woman
with previously normal menses). Pregnancy should be the first condition to be
ruled out. Secondary amenorrhea may be caused by hypothalamic etiologies
(such as hypothyroidism or hyperprolactinemia), pituitary conditions (such as
Sheehan syndrome), or ovarian causes (such as premature ovarian failure).
The patient does not have symptoms of hypothyroidism or galactorrhea, postpartum hemorrhage, or hot flushes. Additionally, her history suggests a proximate relationship to the miscarriage. Hence, the most likely diagnosis is
intrauterine adhesions, arising from the curettage of the uterus. With this
condition, the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary are working normally, but
the endometrial tissue is not responsive to the hormonal changes. A hysterosalpingogram, a radiologic study where radiopaque dye is injected into the
uterine cavity via a transcervical catheter, showing obliteration of the
endometrial cavity would establish the diagnosis.

335

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Suspected Intrauterine Adhesions
DEFINITIONS
SECONDARY AMENORRHEA: Absence of menses for a period of 6 months
or more in a woman who has had spontaneous menses.
INTRAUTERINE ADHESIONS (IUA): Condition when scar tissue or
synechiae form to obliterate the endometrial cavity, usually occurring because
of uterine curettage following a pregnancy.
HYSTEROSALPINGOGRAM: A radiologic study in which radiopaque dye is
injected into the endometrial cavity via a transcervical catheter, used to evaluate the endometrial cavity and/or the patency of the fallopian tubes.
HYSTEROSCOPY: Procedure of direct visualization of the endometrial cavity
with an endoscope, a light source, and a distension media.
UTERINE SOUNDING: Assessing the depth and direction of the cervical
and uterine cavity with a thin blunt probe.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Intrauterine Adhesions (Asherman Syndrome)
Intrauterine scarring leading to an unresponsive endometrium is most commonly due to injury to the pregnant or recently pregnant uterus. However, any
mechanical, infectious, or radiation factor can produce endometrial sclerosis
and adhesion formation. The sine qua non for the development of intrauterine
adhesions is endometrial trauma, especially to the basalis layer. The adhesions
are usually strands of avascular fibrous tissue, but they may also consist of inactive
endometrium or myometrium. Myometrial adhesions are usually dense and vascular carrying a poor prognosis. Women with atrophic and sclerotic endometrium
without adhesions carry the worst prognosis. This is usually found after radiation
or tuberculous endometritis and is not amenable to any therapy. Postpartum
curettage performed between the second and fourth weeks after delivery, along
with hypoestrogenic states such as breast-feeding or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, is associated with extensive intrauterine scar formation. Uterine curettage performed after a missed abortion is associated with a higher incidence of
intrauterine synechiae than curettage performed after an incomplete abortion
or a molar pregnancy. Adhesions may also form after a diagnostic D and C. In
general, the routine use of uterine curettage at the time of a diagnostic
laparoscopy is unwarranted and may damage the endometrium.
Intrauterine adhesions should be suspected if a woman presents with secondary amenorrhea, a negative pregnancy test, and does not have progestin-induced

336

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

withdrawal bleeding. There is no consistent correlation between the menstrual
bleeding patterns and the extent of intrauterine adhesions. The diagnosis of
IUA should be suspected on every patient with infertility, recurrent abortions,
uterine trauma, and menstrual abnormalities. The most common method of
diagnosing IUA is by hysterosalpingogram. In cases of severe intrauterine
adhesions, the cavity cannot be sounded, making the procedure very difficult
to perform. Vaginal ultrasound can be used in the diagnosis of IUA; however,
it lacks specificity. Sonohysterography is an excellent complement to the
vaginal ultrasound and can allow for the evaluation of the uterine cavity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive and does not offer a greater
advantage over the other diagnostic modalities. Hysteroscopy allows for direct
visualization of the uterine cavity and is considered the “gold standard” for
the establishment of the diagnosis and extent of the IUA.
Operative hysteroscopy is the ideal treatment for IUA. The postoperative
management may include the insertion of an IUD or a pediatric Foley
catheter to prevent the recently lysed adhesions from reforming. In addition,
the administration of conjugated estrogens and progesterone (medroxyprogesterone acetate) should be considered. The uterine cavity should be reevaluated prior to attempting conception.

B. Pituitary etiology
C. Uterine etiology
D. Cervical condition

CLINICAL CASES

40.2

A 29-year-old woman G2 P0 underwent an evaluation for amenorrhea of
10 months duration. Her menses had been regular previously. A pregnancy
test, TSH, prolactin level, FSH, and LH levels were normal. The patient
had sequential estrogen and progestin therapy without vaginal bleeding.
Her presumptive diagnosis was intrauterine adhesions, which was confirmed with imaging. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
A. Her condition usually occurs after uterine curettage for a pregnancyrelated process.
B. She would best be diagnosed by laparoscopy.
C. The patient likely has cramping pain every month.
D. Her treatment includes endometrial ablation.

40.3

A 32-year-old G1 P1 woman presents with an 8-month history of
amenorrhea. A pregnancy test is negative. TSH and prolactin levels
are normal. The FSH level is elevated at 40 IU/L. Which of the following is the most likely complication for this patient?
A. She is at significant risk for endometrial cancer.
B. She is at increased risk for ovarian cancer.
C. She is at increased risk for osteoporosis.
D. She is at increased risk for multiple gestations.

40.4

A 41-year-old woman is suspected of having intrauterine adhesions
because she has had irregular menses since a spontaneous abortion
18 months previously. Which of the following historical or laboratory
pieces of information would support this diagnosis?
A. Presence of hot flushes
B. FSH level too low to be measurable
C. Normal estradiol levels for a reproductive-aged woman
D. Monophasic basal body temperature chart

ANSWERS
40.1

D. This patient has two potential causes for amenorrhea: IUA
caused by the uterine curettage and cervical stenosis due to the cervical conization. The biphasic basal body temperature chart suggests
normal functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis. The
crampy abdominal pain most likely is due to retrograde menstruation; thus, this is most likely due to a cervical process, cervical
stenosis. If untreated, this patient would likely develop severe
endometriosis.

40.2

A. Uterine curettage for a pregnancy-related process predisposes to
IUA. This is best diagnosed with hysteroscopy (direct visualization
of endometrial cavity) and not laparoscopy (visualized intraperitoneal
cavity). Cervical stenosis, and not IUA, is associated with cramping
pain every month. Ideal treatment for Asherman is operative

338

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

hysteroscopy. The patient has a work-up for secondary amenorrhea,
which is fairly standard consisting of pregnancy test, prolactin and
TSH levels which would alter GnRH pulsations, and FSH and LH
assessing ovarian failure. Sequential estrogen and progestin without
bleeding indicates a uterine/cervical etiology.
40.3

C. This patient has secondary amenorrhea. Her pregnancy test is
negative. The TSH and prolactin levels are normal. Her serum FSH
level is elevated, indicating that she has premature ovarian failure.
Due to the low estrogen levels, she is at risk for osteoporosis. She is
not at risk for endometrial cancer. Patients with PCOS would be at
risk for endometrial cancer due to unopposed estrogen.

40.4

C. With IUA, the hormonal status of the woman should be normal.
This would exclude the possibility of ovarian failure (hot flushes),
low FSH levels, and a monophasic basal body temperature chart
since these are all indications of an abnormal hormonal status.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of secondary amenorrhea after uterine curettage
is intrauterine adhesions.
➤ Intrauterine adhesions are diagnosed by hysterosalpingogram and confirmed by hysteroscopy.
➤ Hysteroscopic resection is the best treatment of intrauterine adhesions.
➤ Uterine curettage, especially associated with pregnancy, is a risk factor for
intrauterine adhesions.
➤ The evaluation of secondary amenorrhea includes a pregnancy test, prolactin level, TSH level, and assessment of gonadotropin levels.

ANSWER TO CASE 41:
Breast, Abnormal Mammogram
Summary: A 59-year-old woman comes into the doctor’s office for a health
maintenance examination. The breasts are nontender and without masses.
Mammography revealed a small cluster of calcifications around a small mass.
➤

Next step: Stereotactic biopsy or needle-localization excisional biopsy of
the breast.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the role of mammography in screening for breast cancer.
2. Know that mammography is not perfect in identifying breast cancer.
3. Know the typical mammographic findings that are suspicious for cancer.

Considerations
This 59-year-old woman is going to her doctor for routine health maintenance. She is taking a thiazide diuretic for mild hypertension. Her blood pressure is mildly elevated. The mammogram reveals a small cluster of
calcifications around a small mass, which is one of the classic findings of
breast cancer. With this mammographic finding, it is of paramount importance to obtain tissue for histologic diagnosis. Because of the high risk of
malignancy, a stereotactic-directed core biopsy, or surgical excisional biopsy,
is preferable to a fine needle aspiration. For needle localization, mammographic guidance is employed so that the end of the needle is placed in the
center of the suspicious area. The surgeon may then perform a breast biopsy
using the needle as a guide. Because the mass is not palpable, a needlelocalized approach is needed. The other option is a stereotactic core biopsy
guided by computer-assisted imaging techniques.

APPROACH TO
The Abnormal Mammogram
DEFINITIONS
SUSPICIOUS MAMMOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: A small cluster of calcifica-

tions, or masses with ill-defined borders.

CLINICAL CASES

341

NEEDLE LOCALIZATION: Procedure in which a sterile needle is placed via

mammographic guidance such that the end of the needle is placed in the center of the suspicious area. The surgeon uses this guide to assist in excising
breast tissue.
STEREOTACTIC CORE BIOPSY: Procedure in which the patient is prone on
the mammographic table and biopsies are taken as directed with computerassisted techniques.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Although a clinical history and proper clinical breast examinations are important in detecting breast cancer, mammography remains the best method of
detecting breast cancer at an early stage.
A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast tissue. Current radiation levels
from mammography have been shown to be safe and cause no increased risk
in developing breast cancer. The radiation exposure is less than 10 rads per
lifetime if annual mammograms begin at age 40 years and continue up to age
90. Both false positives and false negatives of up to 10% have been noted.
Hence, a palpable breast mass in the face of a normal mammogram still
requires a biopsy. Breast implants can diminish the accuracy of a mammogram, particularly if the implants are in front of the chest muscles. Magnetic
resonance imaging has recently been shown to be effective in screening for
breast cancer, particularly in younger patients and those at risk for breast cancer such as due to BRCA mutation. MRI may identify early breast cancers
missed by mammography.
Mammographic findings strongly suggestive of breast cancer include a
mass, often with speculated and invasive borders, or an architectural distortion, or an asymmetric increased tissue density when compared with prior
studies or a corresponding area in the opposite breast (Figure 41–1).
An isolated cluster of tiny, irregular calcifications, especially if linear and
wispy, is an important sign of breast cancer. Skin thickening is also an important prognostic indicator.
If a breast cancer is suspected, biopsy is warranted. A stereotactic biopsy
may be used to localize and sample the lesion. This method employs a computerized, digital, three-dimensional view of the breast and allows the physician to direct the needle to the biopsy site. The procedure carries a 2% to 4%
“miss rate.” Needle-localization biopsies employ multiple mammographic
views of the breast and allow the surgeon to localize the lesion for evaluation.
The latter procedure is more time consuming, carries a comparable 3% to 5%
miss rate, but excises more tissue, which is helpful in “borderline” histologic
conditions, such as ductal carcinoma-in-situ.

A 40-year-old woman undergoes a screening mammogram which
reveals a lesion of the right breast, showing an ill-defined mass with a
cluster of calcifications. She recalls bumping her right breast against a
door knob leading to a bruise approximately 1 year previously. Which

A 39-year-old woman physicist is referred by her physician for a
screening mammogram. She asks about the amount of radiation exposure, and the cumulative risk of cancers due to the radiation. Which
of the following describes the radiation risk with modern mammography given once annually?
A. Increased risk for thyroid cancer
B. No increased risks
C. Increased risk for lung cancer
D. Increased risk of skin cancer in the chest area

41.3

A 55-year-old woman has several coarse calcifications found on mammography that are suspicious for breast cancer. She has no family history of breast cancer and no mass is palpable. Which of the following
is the most accurate statement?
A. The best diagnostic method for this patient is fine-needle aspiration.
B. The next best step is MRI of the lesion.
C. Since there is no palpable mass on physical examination, the patient
may be observed for changes on mammography in 3 months.
D. One option for this patient is a core tissue biopsy by stereotactic
means.

ANSWERS
41.1

C. Fat necrosis resulting from trauma to the breast often leads to
mammographic findings that are identical to breast cancer. This
patient recalls trauma to the breast in the location of the mammographic abnormality. To further evaluate the patient and confirm the
diagnosis, a biopsy should be performed. Cancer is still a concern,
and infiltrating intraductal carcinoma is the most common histological subtype.

41.2

B. Modern mammography has very low radiation and no increased
risk of cancer.

41.3

D. Mammographic findings that are suspicious for cancer must be
addressed. Two viable methods include core biopsy via stereotactic
guidance and needle-localization excision. Fine-needle aspiration is
not sensitive enough, and no mass is palpable to be able to serve for
localizing. MRI does not add to an already suspicious lesion.

344

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Clinical Pearls
➤ Mammographic findings suggestive of cancer include a small cluster of
calcifications around a mass, or a mass with irregular borders.
➤ Stereotactic core biopsy or needle-localization excisional biopsy are two
accepted methods of assessing suspicious, mammographic, nonpalpable
masses.
➤ The amount of radiation from mammography is negligible and has no significant sequelae.
➤ Trauma to the breast may lead to fat necrosis and produce mammographic findings similar to that seen in breast cancer. These lesions should
be excised to confirm the diagnosis.

ANSWERS TO CASE 42:
Amenorrhea (Primary), Müllerian Agenesis
Summary: A 17-year-old nulliparous adolescent female, who may have only
one kidney, presents with primary amenorrhea. She denies weight loss or
excessive exercise. On examination, she is 5 ft 6 in tall and weighs 140 lb. Her
blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Her thyroid gland is normal. She has appropriate Tanner stage IV breast development, axillary and pubic hair, and
female external genitalia.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Müllerian (or vaginal) agenesis.

➤

Next step in diagnosis: Serum testosterone, or karyotype.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the definition of primary amenorrhea, that is, no menses by age 16 years.
2. Know that the two most common causes of primary amenorrhea when
there is normal breast development are müllerian agenesis and androgen
insensitivity.
3. Understand that a serum testosterone level or karyotype would differentiate the two conditions.

Considerations
This 17-year-old adolescent female has never had a menstrual period; therefore, she has primary amenorrhea. She has normal Tanner stage IV breast
development, as well as normal axillary and pubic hair. Breast development
connotes the presence of estrogen, and axillary and pubic hair suggests the
presence of androgens. She also has a history of only one kidney. The most
likely diagnosis is müllerian agenesis, because a significant fraction of these
patients will have a urinary tract abnormality. Also, with androgen insensitivity, there is typically scant axillary and pubic hair since there is a defective
androgen receptor. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a serum testosterone,
which would be normal in müllerian agenesis, and elevated (in the normal
male range) in androgen insensitivity. A karyotype would also help to distinguish the two conditions. Notably, absence of breast development would point
to a hypoestrogenic state such as gonadal dysgenesis (Turner syndrome).

347

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Primary Amenorrhea
DEFINITIONS
PRIMARY AMENORRHEA: No menarche by the age of 16 years.
ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY: An androgen receptor defect in which
46,XY individuals are phenotypically female with normal breast development.
MÜLLERIAN AGENESIS: Congenital absence of development of the uterus,
cervix, and fallopian tubes in a 46,XX female, leading to primary amenorrhea.

CLINICAL APPROACH
When a young woman presents with primary amenorrhea, the differential
diagnosis can be narrowed based on whether or not normal breast tissue is
present, and whether a uterus is present or absent. After pregnancy is
excluded, the two most common etiologies that cause primary amenorrhea
associated with normal breast development and an absent uterus are androgen
insensitivity syndrome and müllerian agenesis (Table 42–1).
An individual with androgen insensitivity syndrome, also known as testicular feminization, has a 46,XY karyotype with normally functioning male
gonads that produce normal male levels of testosterone. However, due to a
defect of the androgen receptor synthesis or action, there is no formation of

male internal or external genitalia. The external genitalia remain female, as
occurs in the absence of sex steroids. There are no internal female reproductive organs and the vagina is short or absent. Without androgenic opposition
to the small circulating levels of estrogen secreted by the gonads and adrenals
and produced by peripheral conversion of androstenedione, breast development is normal or enhanced. Pubic and axillary hair is absent or scant due
to defective androgen receptors. Therefore, these individuals are genotypically male (46,XY karyotype) but phenotypically female (look like a woman).
The abnormal intra-abdominal gonads are at increased risk for malignancy,
but this rarely occurs before puberty. Thus, gonadectomy is not performed
until after puberty is completed to allow full breast development and linear
growth to occur. After these events take place, usually around age 16 to 18
years, the gonads should be removed. The diagnosis of androgen insensitivity
syndrome should be suspected when a patient has primary amenorrhea, an
absent uterus, normal breast development, and scant or absent pubic and
axillary hair. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a karyotype evaluation
and/or elevated testosterone levels (male normal range).
Women with müllerian agenesis have a 46,XX karyotype, have no uterus
or fallopian tubes, and have a short or absent vagina. Externally, they resemble individuals with androgen insensitivity. They do, however, have normally
functioning ovaries since the ovaries are not müllerian structures, and have
normal breast development. They also have normal pubic and axillary hair
growth because there is no defect in their androgen receptors. Congenital
renal abnormalities occur in about one-third of these individuals. These
women are genotypically male (46,XX) and phenotypically female. The diagnosis of müllerian agenesis should be suspected when a patient has primary
amenorrhea, an absent uterus, normal breast development, and normal pubic
and axillary hair. The presence of normal pubic and axillary hair is what differentiates them from individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome, and
laboratory confirmation can be accomplished with a karyotype examination
and/or testosterone level.

in a patient with androgen insensitivity?
A. Gonadal production of estrogens
B. Adrenal production of estrogen
C. Breast tissue sensitivity to progesterone
D. Peripheral conversion of androgens
E. Autonomous production of breast-specific estrogen

A 15-year-old adolescent female is brought into the pediatrician due
to absence of breast development and short stature. A karyotype is
performed which reveals 46 XY. Which of the following is the most
likely diagnosis?
A. Androgen insensitivity
C. Gonadal dysgenesis
B. Kallmann syndrome
C. Testicular atrophy syndrome

ANSWERS
42.1

A. Normal breast development, no cervix, and a blind vaginal pouch
may be caused by either müllerian agenesis or androgen insensitivity.
Kallman syndrome is associated with delayed puberty (Tanner stage I
breasts).

42.2

C. The Y-chromosome gonad may become malignant. This patient
likely has gonadal dysgenesis since she has Tanner stage I breast
development. Although usually 45X is associated with gonadal dysgenesis, the karyotype can also be 46,XX or 46,XY. In other words,
this patient has delayed puberty. This is XY gonodal dysgenesis.

350

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

42.3

A. A pelvic kidney most likely is associated with a müllerian abnormality. These women have no uterus or fallopian tubes, and have a
short or absent vagina. They do, however, have normally functioning ovaries because the ovaries are not müllerian structures, and as a
result they have normal breast development.

42.4

D. Individuals with androgen insensitivity usually have full breast
development due to the peripheral conversion of androgens to
estrogens. Also, because of the defective androgen receptor, the high
endogenous androgens do not inhibit breast development as in a normal male, but pubic and axillary hair is scant or absent. The gonads
and adrenals also produce a small circulating amount of estrogen, but
do not contribute as much as the peripheral androgen conversion.
Progesterone sensitivity does not influence breast development, nor
does a breast-specific estrogen.

42.5

C. The most common cause of delayed puberty (absent breast tissue
after age 14 years), is gonadal dysgenesis, which can also occur with a
46,XY karyotype (along with androgen insensitivity). The most common karyotype of gonadal dysgenesis, however, is 45,XO in Turner
syndrome. In androgen insensitivity, normal breast development
occurs. Kallmann syndrome is an example of a hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, or hypothalamic hypogonadism, disorder caused by a
deficiency in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted
by the hypothalamus (and therefore, decreased LH and FSH production). Gonadal dysgenesis, on the other hand, is a state of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Patients with Kallmann syndrome also
typically have a deficiency or inability to smell. Females present with
delayed puberty and lack of breast development, but have a normal
karyotype (46,XX). Treatment is hormone replacement.

Clinical Pearls
➤ A pregnancy test should be the first test for any female with primary or
secondary amenorrhea.
➤ The two most common causes of primary amenorrhea in a woman with
normal breast development are androgen insensitivity and müllerian
agenesis.
➤ Scant axillary and pubic hair suggest androgen insensitivity.
➤ A karyotype and testosterone level help to differentiate between müllerian
agenesis and androgen insensitivity.
➤ Renal anomalies are common with müllerian abnormalities.

Abortion, Septic
Summary: A 23-year-old woman, who had undergone a D and C procedure
3 days ago for an incomplete abortion, complains of continued vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal cramping, and fever and chills. Her temperature is
102.5°F (39.16°C), BP 90/40 mm Hg, and HR 120 bpm. The lungs are clear.
There is moderately severe lower abdominal tenderness. The cervix is open,
and there is uterine tenderness. The laboratory studies are significant for
leukocytosis and a normal urinalysis.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Septic abortion (with retained products of
conception).

➤

Next step in management: Broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by
dilatation and curettage of the uterus.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the clinical presentation of septic abortion.
2. Know that the treatment of septic abortion involves both antibiotic therapy and uterine curettage.

Considerations
This 23-year-old woman underwent a D and C procedure for an incomplete
abortion 3 days previously and now presents with lower abdominal cramping,
vaginal bleeding, fever, and chills. The open cervical os, lower abdominal
cramping, and vaginal bleeding suggest retained products of conception
(POC). The retained POC may lead to ongoing bleeding or infection. In this
case, the fever, chills, and leukocytosis point toward infection. The retained
tissue serves as a nidus for infection. The most common source of the bacteria is the vagina, via an ascending infection. The best treatment is broadspectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage and a uterine curettage.
Usually, surgery is delayed until antimicrobial agents are infused for 4 hours to
allow for tissue levels to increase. Hemorrhage may occur with the curettage
procedure. Also, the patient should be monitored for septic shock.

CLINICAL CASES

355

APPROACH TO
Septic Abortion
DEFINITIONS
SEPTIC ABORTION: Any type of abortion associated with a uterine infection.
SEPTIC SHOCK: The septic portion refers to the presence of an infection

(usually bacterial), and the shock describes a process whereby the patient’s
cells, organs, and/or tissues are not being sufficiently supplied with nutrients
and/or oxygen.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Septic abortion occurs in less than 1% of all spontaneous abortions and about
0.5% of induced abortions. This risk is increased if an abortion is performed
with nonsterile instrumentation. This condition is potentially fatal in 0.4 to
0.6/100,000 spontaneous abortions.
Signs and symptoms of septic abortion are uterine bleeding and/or spotting in
the first trimester with clinical signs of infection. The mechanism is ascending
infection from the vagina or cervix to the endometrium to myometrium to parametrium, and, eventually, the peritoneum. Affected women generally will have
fever and leukocyte counts of greater than 10,500 cells/uL. There is usually lower
abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and a foul-smelling vaginal
discharge. The infection is almost always polymicrobial, involving anaerobic
streptococci, Bacteroides species, Escherichia coli and other gram-negative rods,
and group B β-hemolytic streptococci. Rarely, Clostridium perfringens, Hemophilus
influenzae, and Campylobacter jejuni may be isolated.
When patients present with signs and symptoms of septic abortion, a CBC
with differential, urinalysis, and blood chemistries including electrolytes
should be obtained. A specimen of cervical discharge should be sent for Gram
stain, as well as for culture and sensitivity. If the patient appears seriously ill
or is hypotensive, blood cultures, a chest x-ray, and blood coagulability studies should be done. The blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and
urine output should be monitored.
The treatment has four general parts: (1) maintain the blood pressure;
(2) monitor the blood pressure, oxygenation, and urine output, (3) start antibiotic therapy; and (4) perform a uterine curettage. Immediate therapeutic steps
include intravenous isotonic fluid replacement, especially in the face of hypotension. Concurrently, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics with particular
attention to anaerobic coverage should be infused. The combination of gentamicin and clindamycin has a favorable response 95% of the time. Alternatives
include β-lactam antimicrobials (cephalosporins and extended-spectrum

356

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

penicillins) or those with β-lactamase inhibitors. Another regimen includes
metronidazole plus ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. Because retained POC
are common in these situations, becoming a nidus for infection to develop,
evacuation of the uterine contents is important. Uterine curettage is usually
performed approximately 4 hours after antibiotics are begun, allowing serum
levels to be achieved.
Because oliguria is an early sign of septic shock, the urine output should be
carefully observed. Also, for women in shock, a central venous pressure
catheter may be warranted. Aggressive intravenous fluids are usually effective
in maintaining the blood pressure; however, at times, vasopressor agents, such
as a dopamine infusion, may be required. Other therapies include oxygen, digitalis, and steroids.

357

A 32-year-old Hispanic female G1 P0 at 29 weeks’ gestation presents
to the obstetrical triage unit complaining of fever, chills, and nausea
and vomiting of 3 days duration. She also has myalgias. She denies
leakage of fluid per vagina and states that she has been in good health.
She has not been out of the country for 2 years. Questions about dietary
habits reveal that she does not eat raw or uncooked foods, does not eat
raw shellfish, but she does eat a fair amount of soft goat cheese. Her
temperature is 101°F (38.33°C), BP 100/80 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm. Her
abdominal examination reveals tenderness of the uterine fundus. The
fetal heart rate is 170 bpm. An ultrasound reveals a single gestation
that is viable consistent with 29 weeks’ gestational age, and a normal
amniotic fluid volume. An amniocentesis is performed revealing greenish dark fluid, and a Gram stain of the amniotic fluid shows grampositive rods. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Group B streptococcus infection
B. Clostridial infection
C. Listeria monocytogenes infection
C. Pasteurella multiforme infection
D. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid with bacterial skin contaminant

ANSWERS
43.1

B. Ascending infection is the most likely mechanism of septic abortion. The bacteria involved are typically polymicrobial, particularly
anaerobes that have ascended from the lower genital tract. Signs and
symptoms include uterine bleeding and/or spotting in the first
trimester with clinical signs of infection. There is usually lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Also, careful attention should be given to the patient’s
urine output since oliguria is an early sign of septic shock.

43.2

D. This patient has a septic abortion which has been treated conventionally with IV antibiotics and D and C to remove the nidus of the
infection. She is still febrile and hypotensive despite antibiotic therapy
for 48 hours. Also, due to the pockets of gas noted on CT scan, she
likely has a necrotizing metritis, with gas forming bacteria such as
Clostridial species. Hysterectomy should be performed urgently as she
may suffer severe morbidity or mortality if the procedure is delayed.

43.3

C. Chorioamnionitis, also called intra-amniotic infection, almost
always complicates pregnancies with rupture of membranes. One
exception to this rule is the gram-positive rod Listeria monocytogenes,
which can be acquired through unpasteurized milk products such as
soft goat cheese. The bacterial infection in the maternal gastrointestinal
tract, which presents as a flu-like illness, then is spread hematogenously

358

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

to the fetus, through the placenta. The diagnosis is largely from clinical suspicion and confirmed by amniocentesis. Often the amniotic fluid
is meconium stained, and gram-positive rods may be seen on Gram
stain. The microbiology laboratory should be alerted not to dismiss this
finding as skin (bacteroid) contaminants. Treatment is with IV ampicillin. Many times the infection may be treated with antibiotic therapy
and avoid delivery (again, an exception to the usual rule of needing to
deliver the baby in chorioamnionitis). Listeria can also cause miscarriage and septic abortion.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The bacteria involved in septic abortion are usually polymicrobial, particularly anaerobes that have ascended from the lower genital tract.
➤ Hemorrhage often complicates the curettage for septic abortion.
➤ Treatment of septic abortion consists of maintaining blood pressure; monitoring the blood pressure, oxygenation, and urine output; antibiotics; and
uterine evacuation.

Summary: A 29-year-old parous (G5 P4) woman at 39 weeks’ gestation with
preeclampsia delivers vaginally. She denies a family history of a bleeding
diathesis. After the placenta is delivered, there is appreciable vaginal bleeding, estimated at 1000 cc.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Uterine atony.

➤

Next step in therapy: Dilute intravenous oxytocin, and if this is ineffective, then intramuscular prostaglandin F2-alpha or rectal misoprostal.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the definition of postpartum hemorrhage.
2. Understand that the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is
uterine atony.
3. Know the treatment for uterine atony, and the contraindications for the
various agents.

Considerations
This 29-year-old woman delivers at 39 weeks’ gestation and has an estimated
blood loss of 1000 cc after the placenta delivers. This meets the definition of
postpartum hemorrhage, which is a loss of 500 mL or more after a vaginal
delivery. The most common etiology is uterine atony, in which the
myometrium has not contracted to cut off the uterine spiral arteries that are
supplying the placental bed. Uterine massage and dilute oxytocin are the first
therapies. If these are ineffective, then prostaglandin F2-alpha or rectal misoprostal is the next agent to be used in this patient. Because she is hypertensive, methylergonovine maleate (Methergine) is contraindicated. It should be
noted that if the uterus is palpated and found to be firm and yet bleeding continues, a laceration to the genital tract should be suspected. Her risk factors
for uterine atony include preeclampsia, since she is likely to be treated with
magnesium sulfate.

361

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Postpartum Hemorrhage
DEFINITIONS
POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE (PPH): Classically defined as greater than

500 mL blood loss at a vaginal delivery and greater than 1000 mL during a
cesarean delivery. Practically speaking, it means significant bleeding that may
result in hemodynamic instability if unabated.
UTERINE ATONY: Lack of myometrial contraction, clinically manifested by
a boggy uterus.
METHYLERGONOVINE MALEATE (METHERGINE): An ergot alkyloid
agent that induces myometrial contraction as a treatment of uterine atony,
contraindicated in hypertension.
PROSTAGLANDIN F2-ALPHA: A prostaglandin compound that causes smooth
muscle contraction, contraindicated in asthmatic patients.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as early and late, according to whether it
occurs within the first 24 hours or after that period. The most common cause
of early PPH is uterine atony, with bleeding arising from the placental implantation site. (See Table 44–1 for risk factors.)
The physical examination reveals a boggy uterus. The initial management
should be uterine massage, best accomplished by bimanual compression with an
abdominal hand as well as vaginal hand. Concurrently, intravenous dilute oxytocin is given. If these maneuvers are ineffective, other pharmacological uterotonic agents may be given. These include intramuscular methylergonovine
(Methergine), intramuscular prostaglandin F2-alpha, and rectal misoprostol.

Table 44–1 RISK FACTORS FOR UTERINE ATONY
Magnesium sulfate
Oxytocin use during labor
Rapid labor and/or delivery
Overdistension of the uterus (macrosomia, multifetal pregnancy, hydramnios)
Intra-amniotic infection (chorioamnionitis)
Prolonged labor
High parity

362

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Ergot alkyloids should not be given in women with hypertensive disease because
of the risk of stroke. Prostaglandin F2-alpha should not be administered in those
with asthma due to the potential for bronchoconstriction. Among these three
agents, rectal misoprostol has emerged in many centers as the preferred agent
due to high efficacy, low cost, and low side effects. If medical therapy is ineffective, then two large-bore intravenous lines should be placed, the blood bank
should be notified, and anesthesiologist alerted. Surgical therapy may include
exploratory laparotomy, with interruption of the blood vessels to the uterus such
as uterine artery ligation or internal iliac artery ligation. More recently, suture
methods that attempt to compress the uterus, such as the B-lynch stitch, have
been described. If these fail, then hysterectomy may be life-saving.
Other causes of early PPH include genital tract lacerations, which should be
suspected with a firm contracted uterus. The vaginal side walls and cervix
should be especially carefully inspected. Repair of the complete extent of the
laceration is important. Uterine inversion, whether partial or complete, must
also be considered. Placental causes include accreta or retained placenta. If the
uterus is firm and there are no lacerations, one must also consider coagulopathy.
Late PPH, defined as occurring after the first 24 hours, may be caused by
subinvolution of the placental site, usually occurring at 10 to 14 days after
delivery. In this disorder, the eschar over the placental bed usually falls off and
the lack of myometrial contraction at the site leads to bleeding. Classically,
the patient will not have bleeding until about 2 weeks after delivery, and is
not significantly anemic. Oral ergot alkyloid and careful follow-up is the standard treatment; other options include intravenous dilute oxytocin or intramuscular prostaglandin F2-alpha compounds.
Another causative process is retained products of conception. Women
with retained POC generally have uterine cramping and bleeding, and may
have fever and/or foul-smelling lochia. Ultrasound examination helps to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment includes uterine curettage and broadspectrum antibiotics.

A 34-year-old woman is noted to have significant uterine bleeding
after a vaginal delivery complicated by placenta abruption. She is
noted to be bleeding from multiple venipuncture sites. Which of the
following is the best therapy?
A. Immediate hysterectomy
B. Packing of the uterus
C. Hypogastric artery ligation
D. Ligation of utero-ovarian ligaments
E. Correction of coagulopathy

ANSWERS
44.1

A. Uterine atony is the most common cause of PPH, even after
cesarean delivery. With a prolonged labor, such as with arrest of active
phase, a patient is at risk for uterine atony. The finding of a boggy
uterus would be indicative. Certainly, lacerations or injury to uterine
vessels is a potential issue, and should be visible on examination. The
treatment for uterine atony during cesarean is similar to a patient who
underwent vaginal delivery, including intravenous dilute pitocin,
prostaglandin compounds (such as intramuscular PG F2-alpha or rectal misoprostol). If these measures are unsuccessful, then surgical
management of uterine atony includes ligation of blood supply to the
uterus to decrease the pulse pressure (suture ligation of the ascending
branch of the uterine artery, or the utero-ovarian ligament, or internal iliac artery), or the B-lynch stitch to try to compress the uterus
with external suture “netting.” Sometimes hysterectomy needs to be
performed due to unresponsive hemorrhage.

44.2

B. Genital tract laceration is the most common cause of PPH in a
well-contracted uterus. This is most likely arising from a cervical laceration, commonly laterally into or adjacent to the arterial supply of
the cervix. Upon recognition of PPH, the physician should address
the ABCs, assess the patient’s blood pressure and HR, and have IV
isotonic crystalloid infusing quickly. A second large-bore IV infusion
should be started. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony
and so attention should be directed toward fundal massage and infusion of pitocin. If the fundus is firm and the uterus well contracted,
the next step should be to assess for a genital tract laceration.
Inspection for whether the bleeding is coming supracervical (uterus)
versus cervical or lower in the genital tract is critical. Supracervical
bleeding speaks for coagulopathy, retained POC, or atypical uterine
atony. The cervix and then vagina should be carefully inspected for
lacerations. Often, if the patient is in a regular labor and delivery room,
moving the patient to the operating room with adequate lighting and

CLINICAL CASES

365

anesthesia can be helpful. Blood products should be on hand if bleeding persists. At times a genital tract laceration may extend high into
the vaginal fornix; careful assessment of the full extent of the laceration, and judicious surgical repair is warranted.
44.3

B. Ligation of the ascending branch of the uterine arteries or the
internal iliac (hypogastric) artery are methods for decreasing the
pulse pressure to the uterus and can help in PPH. Ligation of the cardinal ligaments leads to interruption of the uterine arteries, which
usually means that a hysterectomy is necessary. Ligation of the external iliac artery would lead to lower extremity necrosis. A cervical
cerclage is not a treatment option for hemorrhage; instead, it is a procedure performed in order to prevent preterm labor and delivery in a
pregnant woman with an incompetent uterus.

44.4

E. Bleeding from multiple venipuncture sites together with abruption suggests a coagulopathy. This is a systemic response, so no type
of localized treatment will fix the problem. A patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can present with a simultaneously occurring thrombotic and bleeding problem, which makes it
difficult to choose a treatment option.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony.
➤ The most common cause of early PPH with a firm, well-contracted uterus
is a genital tract laceration.
➤ The most common cause of late postpartum hemorrhage (after the first
24 hours) is subinvolution of the uterus.
➤ Hypertensive disease is a contraindication for ergot alkyloids, and asthma
is a contraindication for prostaglandin F2-alpha.
➤ The evaluation and treatment of PPH should be systematic and efficient
and involves two aspects: stabilization of the circulatory status, and
addressing the hemorrhage.
➤ Stabilization of the patient begins by addressing the ABCs, assuring a second large-bore IV infusion of isotonic crystalloid, assuring availability of
blood products if needed, and constantly monitoring key hemodynamic
parameters (mental status, BP, HR, urinary output, bleeding, capillary refill).
➤ The systematic search for the etiology of PPH should begin with uterine
atony, then genital tract lacerations with careful inspection to discern
whether the bleeding is supracervical, cervical, or lower genital tract.

Pubertal Delay, Gonadal Dysgenesis
Summary: A healthy 16-year-old adolescent female is referred for never having menstruated. She denies excessive exercise or an eating aversion. On
examination, she is 50 in tall and weighs 100 lb. The neck is supple and without masses. Her breasts and pubic hair are both Tanner stage I. The abdominal examination reveals no masses. The pelvic examination is consistent with
a prepubescent female.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Gonadal dysgenesis (Turner syndrome).

➤

Next step in diagnosis: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know that absence of secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 years constitutes delayed puberty.
2. Know that the most common cause of sexually infantile delayed puberty,
gonadal dysgenesis, is usually associated with a chromosomal abnormality.
3. Understand that the FSH level can help to determine whether the delayed
puberty is due to a CNS problem or an ovarian problem.

Considerations
This 16-year-old adolescent female has never menstruated and, therefore, has
primary amenorrhea. Furthermore, she has not yet experienced breast development (which should occur by age 14 years) and thus has delayed puberty.
The lack of breast development means a lack of estrogen, which may be
caused by either a central nervous system problem (low gonadotropin levels)
or an ovarian problem (elevated gonadotropins). She is also of short stature,
confirming the lack of estrogen. The absent pubic and axillary hair is consistent with delayed puberty. The most likely diagnosis without further information would be gonadal dysgenesis, such as Turner syndrome. An elevated
FSH level would be confirmatory.

DELAYED PUBERTY: Lack of secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 years.
GONADAL DYSGENESIS: Failure of development of ovaries, usually associ-

ated with a karyotypic abnormality (such as 45,X) and often associated with
streaked gonads. Less commonly, the karyotype may be 46,XX or 46,XY.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Maturation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis leads to the onset of
puberty. There are four stages of pubertal development: (1) thelarche, (2) pubarche/
adrenarche, (3) growth spurt, and (4) menarche. The first sign of puberty is
the appearance of breast budding (thelarche), which occurs at a mean age of
10.8 years. This is followed by the appearance of pubic and axillary hair
(pubarche/adrenarche), usually at 11 years. The growth spurt typically occurs
1 year after thelarche. The onset of menses (menarche) is the final event of
puberty, occurring approximately 2.3 years after thelarche, at a mean age of
12.9 years. Normal puberty takes place between the ages of 8 to 14 years, with
an average duration of 4.5 years. Delayed puberty is the absence of secondary
sexual characteristics by age 14 years.
Thelarche → Adrenarche → Growth spurt → Menarche
Breast bud → Axillary and pubic hair → Menses
Delayed puberty can be subdivided based on two factors: the gonadotropic
and the gonadal state. The FSH level defines the gonadotropic state. The
ovarian production of estrogen refers to the gonadal state. The FSH level differentiates between brain and ovarian causes of delayed puberty. Central
nervous system defects result in low FSH levels secondary to disruption of the
hypothalamic–pituitary axis. With ovarian failure, the negative feedback of
estrogen on the properly functioning hypothalamic–pituitary axis is not present, resulting in high FSH levels.
Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (high FSH, low estrogen) is due to
gonadal deficiency. The most common cause of this type of delayed puberty is
Turner syndrome. These individuals have an abnormality in or absence of one
of the X chromosomes leading to gonadal dysgenesis and a 45,X karyotype.
They do not have true ovaries, but rather a fibrous band of tissue referred to
as gonadal streaks. Thus, they lack ovarian estrogen production and, as a
result, secondary sexual characteristics. The internal and external genitalia

370

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

are that of a normal female, but remain infantile even into adult life. Other
characteristic physical findings are short stature, webbed neck, shield chest,
and increased carrying angle at the elbow. Turner syndrome should be suspected in an individual who presents with primary amenorrhea, prepubescent
secondary sexual characteristics, and sexually infantile external genitalia. The
definitive diagnosis can be made with an elevated FSH level and a karyotypic
evaluation. Occasionally, the karyotype with gonadal dysgenesis may be
46,XX or 46,XY. When affected with 46,XY, the gonads should be removed
surgically to avoid neoplastic changes. Other causes of hypergonadotropic
hypogonadism are ovarian damage due to exposure to ionizing radiation,
chemotherapy, inflammation, or torsion.
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low FSH, low estrogen) is usually secondary to a central defect. Hypothalamic dysfunction may occur due to poor
nutrition or eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia), extremes in exercise, and chronic illness or stress. Other causes are primary hypothyroidism,
Cushing syndrome, pituitary adenomas, and craniopharyngiomas (the most
commonly associated neoplasm).
The diagnostic approach to delayed puberty begins with a meticulous history and physical examination. The history should query chronic illnesses,
exercise and eating habits, and age at menarche of the patient’s sisters and
mother. The physical examination should search for signs of chronic illness,
such as a goiter, or neurologic deficits, such as visual field defects indicative of
cranial neoplasms. Skull imaging should be obtained to look for intracranial
lesions. The laboratory evaluation should include serum measurements of
FSH, prolactin, TSH, free T4, and appropriate adrenal and gonadal steroids.
A karyotype evaluation should be performed when the FSH level is elevated.
The management goals for those with delayed puberty are to initiate and
sustain sexual maturation, prevent osteoporosis from hypoestrogenemia, and
promote the full height potential. Hormonal therapy and human growth hormone can be used to achieve these objectives. Combination oral contraceptives provide the small amounts of estrogen needed to promote growth and
development and the progestin protects against endometrial cancer.

Comprehension Questions

A 15-year-old adolescent female is diagnosed with gonadal dysgenesis
based on delayed puberty, short stature, and elevated gonadotropin
levels. Which of the following is generally present?
A. Secondary amenorrhea
B. 69,XXY karyotype
C. Tanner stage IV breast development
D. Osteoporosis
E. Polycystic ovaries

A 15-year-old adolescent female is brought into the pediatrician’s
office due to no breast development. The patient’s mother notes that
both of patient’s sisters had onset of breast development at age 10, and
also all of her friends have already begun menstruating. Examination
reveals Tanner stage I breast and pubic/axillary hair, and is otherwise
unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Delayed puberty
B. Development is within normal limits and should be observed
C. Primary amenorrhea
D. Likely craniopharyngioma

45.3

A 16-year-old adolescent female is evaluated for lack of pubertal
development. She is diagnosed with gonadal dysgenesis. Which of the
following laboratory findings is likely to be elevated in this patient?
A. Follicle-stimulating hormone levels
B. Estrogen levels
C. Progesterone levels
D. Prolactin levels
E. Thyroxine levels

45.4

A 20-year-old individual with a 46,XY karyotype is noted to be sexually infantile phenotypic female and diagnosed as having gonadal dysgenesis. Which of the following is the most important treatment for
this patient?
A. Progestin therapy to reduce osteoporosis
B. Estrogen and androgen therapy to enhance height
C. Progesterone therapy to prevent endometrial cancer
D. Gonadectomy
E. Estrogen therapy to initiate breast development

ANSWERS
45.1

D. Breast tissue usually is infantile (Tanner stage I) with gonadal
dysgenesis because no estrogen is produced; these patients are at risk
for osteoporosis. Breast tissue is a reflection of endogenous estrogen.
They have primary amenorrhea, and usually a 45,X karyotype.
They have streak ovaries, and not polycystic ovaries (PCOS).
PCOS is a condition in which there is unopposed estrogen, high levels
of circulating androgens, and no pubertal delay is typically present. The
LH:FSH ratio is usually greater than 1.

45.2

A. Delayed puberty is defined as no secondary sexual characteristics
by age 14 years. Primary amenorrhea is defined as no menarche by
age 16 years. Although this patient is still within normal limits, an
abbreviated work-up such as TSH, prolactin level, and possibly bone
age x-rays may be ordered. The physical examination should be

372

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

performed and if there are any stigmata of Turner syndrome, then
FSH and karyotype should be pursued.
45.3

A. With gonadal dysgenesis, the FSH level is elevated. This distinguishes ovarian failure from a central nervous system dysfunction
(central defect). The FSH level determines the gonadotropic state,
and the ovarian estradiol level dictates the gonadal state. Estrogen
levels are low; the progesterone, prolactin, and thyroxine levels
remain unchanged.

45.4

D. The Y chromosome predisposes intra-abdominal gonads to
malignancy. Even a mosaic karyotype, such as 46,XX/46,XY, would
predispose to gonadal malignancy. Had the patient had a karyotype
similar to that in Turner syndrome (45,X), another gonadal dysgenesis disorder, a gonadectomy on the streak ovaries, would not be
indicated.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of sexually infantile primary amenorrhea is
gonadal dysgenesis.
➤ The most common karyotype associated with gonadal dysgenesis is 45,X,
although 46,XX or 46,XY may be seen.
➤ Delayed puberty is defined as no development of secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 years.
➤ The FSH level distinguishes ovarian failure from central nervous system
dysfunction.
➤ The FSH level determines the gonadotropic state, and the ovarian estradiol
level dictates the gonadal state.
➤ The most important initial test for primary amenorrhea with normal breast
development is a pregnancy test.

Case 46
A 20-year-old parous woman complains of right breast pain and fever.
She states that 3 weeks previously, she underwent a normal spontaneous
vaginal delivery. She had been breast-feeding without difficulty until
2 days ago, when she noted progressive pain, induration, and redness to
the right breast. On examination, her temperature is 102°F (38.8°C),
blood pressure (BP) 100/70 mm Hg, and heart rate (HR) 110 beats per
minute (bpm). Her neck is supple. Her right breast has induration on
the upper outer region with redness and tenderness. There is also significant fluctuance noted in the breast tissue. The abdomen is nontender
and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. The pelvic examination

ANSWERS TO CASE 46:
Breast Abscess and Mastitis
Summary: A 20-year-old breast-feeding woman who is 3 weeks postpartum
complains of right breast pain and fever of 2 days duration. She notes progressive pain, induration, and redness in the right breast. Her temperature is
102°F (38.8°C). There is also significant fluctuance noted in the right breast.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Abscess of the right breast.

➤

Next step in therapy: Incision and drainage of the abscess and antibiotic
therapy.

➤

Etiology of the condition: Staphylococcus aureus.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical presentation of postpartum mastitis.
2. Know that S aureus is the most common etiology in postpartum mastitis.
3. Understand that the presence of fluctuance in the breast probably represents an abscess that needs incision and drainage.

Considerations
This woman is 3 weeks postpartum with breast pain and fever. This is a typical presentation of a breast infection, since mastitis usually presents in the
third or fourth postpartum week. Induration and redness of the breast accompanied by fever and chills are also consistent. The treatment for this condition is an antistaphylococcal agent, such as dicloxacillin. Provided that the
offending agent is not methicillin resistant, improvement should be rapid.
Affected women are instructed to continue to breast-feed or drain the breast
by pump. This patient has fluctuance of the breast that speaks for an abscess,
which usually requires surgical drainage and will not generally improve with
antibiotics alone. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, ultrasound examination may be helpful in identifying a fluid collection.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Breast Infections
DEFINITIONS
MASTITIS: Infection of the breast parenchyma typically caused by S aureus.
BREAST ABSCESS: The presence of a collection of purulent material in the
breast, which requires drainage.
GALACTOCELE: A noninfected collection of milk due to a blocked mammary duct leading to a palpable mass and symptoms of breast pressure and
pain.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Postpartum breast disorders and infections are common. They include
cracked nipples, breast engorgement, mastitis, breast abscesses, and galactoceles. Cracked nipples usually arise from dryness, and may be exacerbated by
harsh soap or water-soluble lotions. Treatment includes air-drying the nipples,
the use of a nipple shield, or the application of an oil-based lotion.
Breast engorgement is usually noted during the first week postpartum and
is due to vascular congestion and milk accumulation. The patient will generally complain of breast pain and induration, and may have a low-grade fever.
Infant feedings around-the-clock usually help to alleviate this condition.
Fever seldom persists for more than 12 to 24 hours. Treatment consists of a
breast binder, ice packs, and analgesics.
Postpartum mastitis is an infection of the breast parenchyma, affecting
about 2% of lactating women. These infections usually occur between the second and fourth week after delivery. Other signs and symptoms include malaise,
fever, chills, tachycardia, and a red, tender, swollen breast. Importantly, there
should be no fluctuance of the breast, which would indicate abscess formation.
The most commonly isolated organism is S aureus, usually arising from the
infant’s nose and throat. The treatment for mastitis should be prompt to prevent abscess formation, consisting of an antistaphylococcal agent, such as
dicloxacillin. Breast-feeding should be continued to prevent the development
of abscess.
About 1 in 10 cases of mastitis are complicated by abscess, which should
be suspected with persistent fever after 48 hours of antibiotic therapy or the
presence of a fluctuant mass. Ultrasound examination may be performed to
confirm the diagnosis. The purulent collection is best treated by surgical
drainage, or alternatively by ultrasound-guided aspiration; antistaphylococcal
antibiotics should also be used.

376

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

The galactocele or milk-retention cyst is caused by blockage of a milk duct.
The milk accumulates in one or more breast lobes, leading to a nonerythematous fluctuant mass. They usually resolve spontaneously, but may need
aspiration.

46.4. A 29-year-old G1 P1 woman desires to breast-feed her infant, which
is 1 day old. The infant received an injection of vitamin K. You counsel the patient on positive health consequences of breast-feeding
including immunological, bonding, neurodevelopmental, and gastrointestinal effects. Which of the following requires supplementation
in the first 6 months as it is not present in breast milk?
A. Iron
B. Vitamin D
C. Vitamin E
D. Vitamin K

ANSWERS
46.1

C. Maternal HIV infection is a contraindication for breast-feeding
because the neonate may contract the infection from infected breast
milk. Dilantin and ampicillin are safe to take during pregnancy.
Though challenging, women with inverted nipples are still able to
breast-feed. There are very few contraindications to breast-feeding:
infants with classic galactosemia (galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency); mothers who have active untreated tuberculosis
disease or HIV infection; mothers who are receiving diagnostic or
therapeutic radioactive isotopes or have had exposure to radioactive
materials; mothers who are receiving antimetabolites or chemotherapeutic agents or a small number of other medications until they
clear the milk; mothers who are using drugs of abuse (“street drugs”);
and mothers who have herpes simplex lesions on a breast.

46.2

E. This woman has had persistent tenderness and redness of the breast
despite not lactating and not having trauma to the breast; these symptoms have worsened despite antibiotic therapy. There is a concern
about inflammatory breast carcinoma, and she should undergo biopsy.

46.3

D. This patient has a galactocele. It is not an abscess since there is
no fever or redness, although untreated, this could become an
abscess. The best treatment of a galactocele (milk-retention cyst) is
aspiration if it does not resolve spontaneously. This is done to prevent a breast abscess. A galactocele forms when a milk duct is
blocked and the milk accumulates in one or more breast lobes, leading to a nonerythematous fluctuant mass. It is not an infection,
therefore antibiotics and antifungals are unnecessary; it is also not
cancerous, so a mastectomy is not indicated. Bromocriptine is an
ergot alkaloid that blocks the release of prolactin from the pituitary
(typically in the setting of a prolactinoma), mostly as an attempt to
allow a woman to be able to have normal menstrual cycles.

B. Vitamin D should be supplemented at 2 months of age. The
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that unless
contraindicated, each infant be breast-fed exclusively for the first
6 months of life because of the health benefits to the baby. Breast-fed
babies have less infections including meningitis, urinary tract infections, and sepsis thought to be due to immunoglobulin and leukocytes
in the breast milk. They have slightly better neurodevelopmental outcomes, and there is evidence of less risk of diabetes and childhood obesity in later life. Breast milk consists of two proteins, whey and casein,
and has lower casein proportion than formula milk, allowing for easier
digestion. Lactoferrin (inhibits certain iron-dependent bacteria of the
GI tract), secretory IgA, and lysozyme (enzyme which protects against
Escherichia coli and other bacteria) are found in breast milk. Fat and
carbohydrate (lactose) is also found. All the vitamins are found in
breast milk provided the mother’s nutrition is sufficient, with the
exception of vitamin D. The AAP recommends supplementation of
vitamin D drops at 2 months of age for infants exclusively breast-fed.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The best treatment for postpartum mastitis is an oral antistaphylococcal
antibiotic, such as dicloxacillin, and continued breast-feeding or pumping.
➤ The presence of fluctuance in a red, tender, indurated breast suggests
abscess, which needs surgical drainage.
➤ The best treatment of cracked nipples is air-drying and the avoidance of
using a harsh soap.
➤ Breast engorgement rarely causes high fever persisting more than 24 hours.

Most likely diagnosis: Thyroid storm.

➤

Best management for this condition: A β-blocker (such as propranolol),
corticosteroids, and PTU.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know that the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United
States is Graves disease.
2. Recognize the clinical presentation and danger of thyroid storm.

Considerations
This 18-year-old woman at 35 weeks’ gestation has a history of hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease. In the United States, the majority of hyperthyroidism is due to Graves disease; the clinical presentation is typically that
of a painless, uniformly enlarged thyroid gland with occasional proptosis. She
is being treated with propylthiouracil, which is the most commonly used medication for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. For whatever reason, which is not
stated, the patient has symptoms of increased thyrotoxicosis of 1-day duration. Some possible reasons include noncompliance with the medication, or a
stressor, such as surgery or an illness. This woman not only has the nervousness and palpitations of hyperthyroidism, but also autonomic instability,
which is the hallmark of thyroid storm. Her blood pressure is 150/110 mm Hg
and her temperature is elevated. She is disoriented and markedly confused.
Thyroid storm must be recognized because it carries a significant risk of mortality. The therapy consists of a β-blocking agent, such as propranolol, corticosteroids, and additional propylthiouracil. In the nonpregnant patient or a
pregnant patient who is sufficiently ill, a saturated solution of potassium
iodide (SSKI) oral drops may also be used; however, this agent may affect the
fetal thyroid gland. Notably, the patient has a high white blood cell count.

CLINICAL CASES

381

This fact is important since rarely, PTU can induce a bone marrow aplasia,
leading to leukopenia, and sepsis.

APPROACH TO
Thyrotoxicosis in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
HYPERTHYROIDISM: A syndrome caused by excess thyroid hormone, leading to nervousness, tachycardia, palpitations, weight loss, diarrhea, and heat
intolerance.
THYROID STORM: Extreme thyrotoxicosis leading to central nervous system
dysfunction (coma or delirium) and autonomic instability (hyperthermia,
hypertension, or hypotension).
GRAVES DISEASE: The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis in the United
States, leading to a diffusely enlarged goiter.
FREE THYROXINE (T4): Unbound or biologically active thyroxine hormone.
THIONAMIDE ANTITHYROID MEDICATIONS: Propylthiouracil and
methimazole (MMI) are the two thionamide medications are approved for use
in the United States.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hyperthyroidism is rare in pregnancy, occurring in about 1 in 2000 pregnancies. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include tachycardia, heat intolerance, nausea, weight loss or failure to gain weight despite adequate food intake,
thyromegaly, thyroid bruit, tremor, exophthalmos, and systolic hypertension.
The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is Graves disease,
an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies are produced which mimic the
function of TSH. These antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland to produce
more thyroid hormone, leading to the symptoms responsible for thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is confirmed in the presence of an elevated free thyroxine and low serum TSH levels. Treatment during pregnancy
may be medical or surgical; however, generally, hyperthyroidism in pregnancy
is managed medically. Propylthiouracil is generally accepted as the drug of
choice in pregnancy. PTU inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 but
may cross the placenta somewhat. Methimazole is another option. Both PTU
and MMI cross the placenta and can lead to some transient neonatal
hypothyroidism. Because MMI has been possibly associated with aplasia cutis
congenital (skin or scalp defects), PTU is usually the drug of choice in pregnancy. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal effects.

382

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Thyroidectomy is reserved for those patients who are noncompliant with or
cannot tolerate medical therapy. Risks from surgery include vocal cord paralysis and hypoparathyroidism.
Thyroid storm is a rare but life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism. Symptoms suggestive of storm include altered mental status, hyperthermia, hypertension, and diarrhea. Congestive heart failure can result from
the effects of thyroxine on the myocardium. Because the mortality rate associated with thyroid storm is high, accurate early identification is crucial.
These patients are best monitored in an intensive care unit. Propylthiouracil
is administered by mouth or nasogastric tube. β-Blockers are used to control
the symptoms of tachycardia; however, they should be used with caution in
those patients with congestive heart failure. Acetaminophen or cooling blankets are used for hyperthermia. Corticosteroids may also be used to prevent
the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.
Maternal hyperthyroidism may result in either fetal hyper or hypothyroidism. When identified antenatally, the fetus should be treated either with
maternal administration of propylthiouracil or injection of intraamniotic thyroxine (fetal hypothyroidism). Failure to identify fetal thyrotoxicosis can
result in nonimmune hydrops and fetal demise.
Recently, subclinical maternal hypothyroidism has gained interest, since this
condition may be associated with adverse neurological development and childhood intelligence. There is some evidence that levothyroxine replacement in
the first trimester may lead to better outcomes. Currently, there is no consensus
on universal screening for maternal hypothyroidism; however those patients at
increased risk or with symptoms should certainly undergo screening.

ANSWERS
47.1

B. Pregnancy due to the estrogen hormone causes increases in the
thyroid-binding globulin and total T4, but does not change the active
or free T4 or the TSH. In general, pregnancy is a euthyroid state.

47.2

A. A TSH level is considered the best screening test for hyperthyroidism. A low level suggests hyperthyroidism; an elevated level suggests hypothyroidism. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is confirmed
by the presence of an elevated free T4 level. Maternal hyperthyroidism
may result in either fetal hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Failure
to identify fetal thyrotoxicosis can result in nonimmune hydrops and
fetal demise. For this reason, it is important to screen women in their

384

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

prenatal screen for TSH levels. If the TSH is borderline or a more
definitive diagnosis is sought, then free T4 is a good follow-up test.
47.3

B. Overall, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United
States is Graves disease. However, in the postpartum period, women
with hyperthyroidism are more likely to have destructive lymphocytic
thyroiditis. This is because the high corticosteroid levels in pregnancy
suppress the autoimmune antibodies, and a flare occurs postpartum
when the corticosteroid levels fall after the placenta delivers. Often,
antimicrosomal and anti-peroxidase antibodies are present. Thus, the
postpartum patient is unique in that the cause of hyperthyroidism is
lymphocytic thyroiditis rather than Graves disease.

47.4

C. With hypothyroidism, the TSH level is elevated and the free T4 is
decreased. With hyperthyroidism, the TSH is decreased and the free
T4 is increased. Normally, with pregnancy, the only physiologic change
is increased total T4. With early or mild hypothyroidism, one may
occasionally find the TSH level as normal (upper limits of normal)
and free T4 as low; however, the findings most consistent with
hypothyroidism would be elevated TSH and low T4.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. Thyroid storm should be considered when central nervous system
dysfunction and autonomic instability are present. The treatments for thyroid storm in pregnancy include PTU, steroids, and β-blockers.
➤ Pregnancy (or use of estrogens) causes total thyroxine to be increased, free
T4 to be unchanged,TSH to be unchanged, and thyroid-binding globulin to
be increased.
➤ Postpartum thyroiditis often occurs 1 to 4 months postpartum, is associated with antimicrosomal antibodies, and can lead to hypothyroidism.
➤ Maternal hypothyroidism that is untreated can lead to neonatal and childhood neurodevelopmental delays.

Case 48
An 18-year-old G1 P0 at 22 weeks’ gestation has a positive Chlamydia
DNA assay of the endocervix. She denies vaginal discharge, lower
abdominal pain, or fever. On examination, her blood pressure (BP) is
110/70 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) is 70 beats per minute (bpm), and she is
afebrile. Her heart and lung examinations are normal. Her abdomen is
nontender and gravid. The fundal height is 20 cm and fetal heart tones
are in the 140 bpm range. The gonococcal culture is negative and the
Pap smear result is normal. Her HIV test by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is also positive.

ANSWERS TO CASE 48:
Chlamydial Cervicitis and HIV in Pregnancy
Summary: An 18-year-old G1 P0 at 22 weeks’ gestation has a positive Chlamydia
DNA assay of the endocervix. She denies lower abdominal pain and is afebrile.
Her abdomen is nontender and gravid. The gonococcal culture is negative.
➤

Next step in therapy: Oral erythromycin, azithromycin, or amoxicillin.

➤

Next diagnostic step for HIV: Either Western blot confirmation, or
PCR confirmation.

➤

Optimal treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy: Assessment of stage
of HIV infection, initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART), offer elective cesarean delivery, oral zidovudine to the
neonate.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of cervicitis.
2. Know that tetracyclines (doxycycline also) are contraindicated in pregnancy.
3. Know that chlamydial infections may lead to neonatal pneumonia or conjunctivitis if untreated.

Considerations
This 18-year-old nulliparous woman at 22 weeks’ gestation has a positive
DNA test for Chlamydia. These types of tests are often utilized because of their
high sensitivity and specificity yet lower cost as compared with chlamydial
cultures. This patient has a chlamydial infection, which is more common
than gonorrheal involvement; accordingly, her gonorrheal culture was negative. Chlamydial endocervical infection has not been proven to cause adverse
problems with pregnancy, such as preterm labor or preterm premature rupture
of membranes. It has been implicated in neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia. Interestingly, the erythromycin eye ointment given at birth does not
prevent chlamydial conjunctivitis, although it does protect against gonococcal eye infection. Babies with documented chlamydial ophthalmic infections
are given oral erythromycin for 14 days. Because it is mainly neonatal disease
that is the issue, an important time to screen for the organism would be the
third trimester, close to the time of delivery. Treatment includes erythromycin or amoxicillin for 7 days or azithromycin as a one-time dose.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Cervicitis and HIV in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
CHLAMYDIAL NEONATE INFECTION: Conjunctivitis or pneumonia
acquired by inoculation during the birth process.
TETRACYCLINE EFFECT: Tetracycline compounds, such as doxycycline,
taken by pregnant women can lead to staining of the fetal teeth.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Chlamydia and Gonorrhea
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular organism with several serotypes.
It is one of the most common sexually transmitted organisms in the United
States, causing urethritis, mucopurulent cervicitis, and late postpartum
endometritis. Vertical transmission may occur during the labor and delivery
process, leading to neonatal conjunctivitis or pneumonia. It is unclear whether
chlamydial infection of the cervix is associated with preterm labor or preterm
rupture of membranes; thus, the main concern is for the neonate. Eye prophylaxis is effective for preventing gonococcal conjunctivitis but not chlamydial
involvement. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is now the most common cause of conjunctivitis in the first month of life. Late postpartum endometritis, occurring
2 to 3 weeks after delivery, is associated with chlamydial disease.
Usually, chlamydial infections are asymptomatic, although they may cause
mucopurulent cervicitis or urethritis. Some risk factors include unmarried status, age under 25, multiple sexual partners, and late or no prenatal care. The
discharge is often difficult to detect because of the increased cervical mucus
in pregnancy. Direct fluorescent antibody tests and DNA detection tests using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are highly sensitive and specific, and less
costly than culture. Treatment includes oral erythromycin, amoxicillin, or
azithromycin. Tetracycline is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the
possibility of staining of the neonatal teeth. Because reinfection is common,
repeat testing is prudent in the third trimester.
Gonococcal infection may complicate pregnancy, especially in teens or
those with a history of sexually transmitted disease. Gonococcal cervicitis is
associated with abortion, preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, and postpartum infection.
Disseminated gonococcal disease is more common in the pregnant woman
(especially the second or third trimesters), presenting as pustular skin lesions,

388

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

arthralgias, and septic arthritis. Untreated gonococcal ophthalmia can
progress to corneal scarring and blindness. Chlamydia commonly is present in
a patient who is infected with gonorrhea. Thus, the usual treatment for gonococcal cervicitis is ceftriaxone intramuscularly and an additional antibiotic
for C trachomatis, such as erythromycin.

HIV Infection
Heterosexual spread of HIV has surpassed intravenous drug use as the most
common mode of transmission in women. This accounts for over half of
recently acquired infections, and usually entails engaging in intercourse with
high-risk individuals such as IV drug users. HIV infection leads to progressive
debilitation of the immune system, rendering infected individuals susceptible
to opportunistic infections and neoplasias that rarely afflict patients with
intact immune systems. Furthermore, the unborn fetus may become infected
either by transplacental passage or during the delivery process. The neonate
may also acquire HIV from infected breast milk. Because measures in pregnancy, during delivery, and postpartum can dramatically decrease the risk of
vertical transmission to the fetus, HIV serostatus should be obtained on every
pregnant woman as early as possible in pregnancy and repeated at the time of
labor or delivery. In fact, over the past 5 years, vertical transmission has dramatically decreased.
Initially, patients may either be asymptomatic or have symptoms that
mimic a mononucleosis-like illness. Antibodies to the HIV virus are usually
detectable 1 month after infection and are almost always detectable within
3 months. Studies have been unable to determine, with certainty, the effect
of pregnancy on HIV disease progression. There continues to be correlation
between maternal disease stage at the time of diagnosis with the viral load and
transmission rates. When loads are reduced to undetectable levels, transmission to the fetus becomes uncommon. Viral load and CD4 T-cell testing are
ways to monitor a woman’s health status. In pregnancy, the viral load should
be evaluated monthly until it is no longer detectable. The goal in pregnancy
is to maintain a viral load under 1000 RNA copies per milliliter.
Treatment regimens, include polytherapy to decrease resistance and compliance is a must. Patients should have regular monitoring of liver function
tests and blood counts to detect toxicity. Combination retroviral therapy
decreases the risk of perinatal transmission to less than 2%. There is evidence
that shows that route of delivery can further decrease vertical transmission.
Scheduled cesarean delivery (prior to labor or rupture of membranes) should
be discussed for HIV-positive women. Those HIV-infected women who
choose to deliver vaginally should receive intravenous zidovudine (ZDV) during labor. Breast-feeding should be discouraged. The neonate generally also
receives oral ZDV syrup.

CLINICAL CASES

389

Recently, the CDC has recommended that labor and delivery units consider the use of rapid HIV testing (results ready within 45 minutes) for those
women with unknown HIV status, so that HIV infection can be identified
and measures may be taken to reduce the risk of vertical transmission.

A 27-year-old woman has been diagnosed with an HIV infection
based on a positive ELISA and confirmed by the Western blot analysis. Which of the following is the most likely method that the patient
became infected?
A. Exposure to infected blood via splash contamination
B. Heterosexual intercourse
C. Homosexual intercourse
D. Intravenous drug use
E. Renal dialysis center

ANSWERS
48.1

B. Chlamydia is not typically seen on Gram stain because it is an
intracellular organism. It does have a propensity for columnar and
transitional epithelium, and it is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. It can cause neonatal pneumonia or conjunctivitis.

48.2

B. Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular organism associated with
late postpartum endometritis and has a long replication cycle.
Erythromycin eyedrops are an effective means of preventing gonococcal eye infection. Gonococcal cervicitis is more likely to disseminate during pregnancy, and a patient may present with septic
arthritis, arthralgias, and pustular skin lesions.

48.3

C. Oral amoxicillin is well tolerated and effective treatment of
chlamydial cervicitis in pregnancy. Oral azithromycin can be tolerated
as well. Erythromycin estolate can lead to liver dysfunction in pregnancy; thus, the estolate salt is contraindicated in pregnant women.
IM ceftriaxone is used to treat gonococcal cervicitis. Doxycycline, or
tetracycline, is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the possibility
of staining neonatal teeth. Ciprofloxacin is also contraindicated in
pregnancy because it may lead to neonatal musculoskeletal problems.

48.4

C. Because labor has already begun, elective cesarean delivery will
not affect vertical transmission. In other words, the cesarean would
need to be performed prior to rupture of membranes or labor to effectively decrease vertical transmission. Intravenous ZDV and minimizing trauma to the baby, such as avoiding fetal scalp electrode or
intrauterine pressure catheters or forceps or vacuum delivery, is advisable. Acyclovir is used to prevent viral shedding in patients infected
with HSV. The neonate generally also receives oral ZDV syrup.

48.5

B. The most common method of HIV transmission to women in the
United States is currently heterosexual intercourse.

CLINICAL CASES

Clinical Pearls
➤ The best treatments for chlamydial cervicitis in pregnancy are erythromycin, azithromycin, and amoxicillin.
➤ Chlamydia can cause conjunctivitis or pneumonia in the neonate.
➤ Ophthalmic antibiotics administered to the neonate help to prevent gonococcal disease but not chlamydial conjunctivitis.

ANSWERS TO CASE 49:
Parvovirus Infection in Pregnancy
Summary: A 24-year-old G2 P1 woman at 22 weeks’ gestation complains of an
episode of myalgias and low-grade fever 1 month ago. Her 2-year-old son had
high fever and “red cheeks.” The fundal height is 28 cm and fetal parts are difficult to palpate.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Hydramnios, with probable fetal hydrops due to
parvovirus B19 infection.

➤

Most likely mechanism: Fetal anemia due to neonatal parvovirus infection, which inhibits bone marrow erythrocyte production.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical presentation of parvovirus infection in children and
adults.
2. Understand the possible effects of parvovirus B19 infection on pregnancy.
3. Know the clinical presentation of hydramnios.

Considerations
This 22-year-old woman presents with a history of myalgias and low-grade
fever. Her 2-year-old son had “red cheeks” and a high fever. This illustrates
the difference in the clinical presentation of parvovirus B19 infection in an
adult versus that of a child. Adults rarely have high fever, but more often have
malaise, arthralgias and myalgias, and a reticular (lacy) faint rash that comes
and goes. Up to 20% of adults will have no symptoms. In contrast, children
often develop the classic “slapped cheek” appearance and high fever, which is
the manifestation of “fifth disease.” Parvovirus infections in pregnancy may
cause a fetal infection, which may lead to suppression of the erythrocyte precursors of the bone marrow. Severe fetal anemia may result, leading to fetal
hydrops. One of the earliest signs of fetal hydrops is hydramnios, or excess
amniotic fluid.
This patient’s uterine size is greater than that predicted by her dates, and
fetal parts are difficult to palpate, which are classic findings of hydramnios.
An ultrasound examination would confirm the fetal and amniotic fluid
effects. The diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection is made by serology (see
Table 49–1).

APPROACH TO
Parvovirus Infection in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
FIFTH DISEASE: Illness caused by a single-stranded DNA virus, parvovirus

B19, also known as erythema infectiosum.
FETAL HYDROPS: A serious condition of excess fluid in body cavities, such
as ascites, skin edema, pericardial effusion, and/or pleural effusion.
HYDRAMNIOS (OR POLYHYDRAMNIOS): Excess amniotic fluid.
SINUSOIDAL HEART RATE PATTERN: A fetal heart rate pattern that
resembles a sine wave with cycles of 3 to 5 per minute, indicative of severe
fetal anemia or fetal asphyxia.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Parvovirus B19 infection is common, and up to 50% of adults have been
infected during childhood or adolescence. It usually causes minimal or no
symptoms in the adult, but may lead to devastating consequences for the fetus.

Reproduced, with permission, from Braunwad E et al. eds. Harrison’s Principles of
Internal Medicine, 15th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill. 2001: 2416.

A small, single-stranded DNA virus, parvovirus B19 causes a red “slapped
cheek” appearance and fever in children; adults usually are less symptomatic
and often have myalgias, and a characteristic lacy reticular rash, which comes
and goes (Figure 49–1).
School-aged children are commonly affected, and frequently transmit the
virus to adults. Specific IgM antibody confirms the diagnosis. Although there
is no universal consensus about how to follow pregnant women who are
infected with parvovirus B19, one commonly used strategy includes weekly
fetal ultrasounds for 10 weeks assessing for fetal hydrops, and if found then
referral for possible intrauterine transfusion. The virus may cause an aplastic
anemia by destroying erythroid precursors.
Approximately half of pregnant women will have had parvovirus infection
and be immune. IgG and IgM serology are helpful (see Table 49–1). Less than
5% of those susceptible pregnant women who are infected will have fetuses
complicated by anemia. There is no vaccine available for parvovirus.
Parvovirus infection may lead to fetal abortion, stillbirth, and hydrops.
Hydrops fetalis is defined as excess fluid located in two or more fetal body cavities, and many times is associated with hydramnios (see Table 49–2 for
causes of hydramnios); pregnancies less than 20 weeks’ gestation are at particular risk. Theories about the mechanism of the hydrops include the observation that the severe anemia may cause heart failure, or induction of the
hematopoietic centers in the liver to replace normal liver tissue, leading to
low serum protein. The anemia is usually transient. For severely affected
fetuses, intrauterine transfusion is one option, while mild cases may sometimes be observed. Other causes of fetal anemia are isoimmunization, such as
an Rh-negative woman who is sensitized to develop anti-D antibodies, a large

A 22-year-old schoolteacher at 28 weeks’ gestation has a history of a
faint rash and low-grade fever. She states that fifth disease is spreading
in her school. Serology is obtained for parvovirus B19 revealing that
the IgM is negative, and the IgG is negative. Which of the following
statements is most accurate?
A. This patient is immune to parvovirus B19 and does not need to be
concerned.
B. This patient is not infected with parvovirus B19, and is susceptible.
C. This patient is infected with parvovirus B19 and is at risk for fetal
hydrops.
D. There is insufficient information to draw a conclusion about
whether this patient is infected.

ANSWERS
49.1

C. Rh isoimmunization can lead to significant fetal anemia if the
baby is Rh positive. With the use of Rhogam, this is a rare event
today. Other causes of isoimmunization, such as anti-Kell disease, are
still a concern. Fetal cardiac arrhythmias especially supraventricular
tachycardia is associated with nonimmune hydrops, but does not
affect the bone marrow. ITP is associated with maternal thrombocytopenia, and rarely fetal thrombocytopenia. IUGR is usually associated with polycythemia. Gestational diabetes does not typically
affect the hemoglobin level.

49.2

B. With fifth disease, the bone marrow is affected leading to anemia
(typically aplastic anemia which destroys erythroid precursors). Rh
disease is caused by the mother’s (Rh−) antibodies attaching the
fetus’ (Rh+) red blood cells and can cause hemolytic disease of the
newborn, and in severe cases may lead to hydrops fetalis. Anti-Duffy
antibodies can also cause hemolytic disease of the newborn in a similar fashion in which the mother’s antibodies attack a particular antigen on the fetus’ red blood cells. With ITP in pregnancy, antiplatelet
antibodies may cross the placenta and cause fetal thrombocytopenia
(can range from minor to severe). HELLP syndrome is a serious, possibly deadly, complication of pregnancy; the only treatment is delivery of the baby.

49.3

D. IgM and IgG serology is the most common method to diagnose
acute fifth disease. Typically, in the acute setting, if the IgG is positive and IgM is negative, it indicates that the patient has been
exposed to parvovirus previously and is immune. When the IgG is
negative and IgM is positive, then it usually means acute parvovirus
infection; sometimes a false-positive IgM can occur, so the IgG and
IgM are repeated in 2 to 3 weeks at which time the IgG should be

CLINICAL CASES

399

positive with a true infection. When the IgG and IgM are both negative, then the patient typically will not be infected and susceptible,
provided sufficient time has elapsed past incubation period. In this
case, the patient has some symptoms of parvovirus infection in a
high-risk setting, so although both IgG and IgM are negative, it
would be wise to repeat it in 1 to 2 weeks to ensure that the incubation period (up to 20 days) has elapsed.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Parvovirus infection in pregnancy can cause fetal anemia leading to
hydrops fetalis.
➤ Hydramnios is one of the earliest manifestations of fetal hydrops.
➤ A parvovirus infection in the adult commonly leads to subtle findings of
myalgias, malaise, and the reticular rash, whereas an infected child often
has high fever and a “slapped cheek” appearance.
➤ Some causes of hydramnios include gestational diabetes, isoimmunization, syphilis, fetal cardiac arrhythmias, and fetal intestinal atresias.

ANSWERS TO CASE 50:
Postpartum Endomyometritis
Summary: A 24-year-old G1 P1 woman, who underwent a cesarean delivery
2 days previously for arrest of labor, has a fever of 102°F (38.8°C). She denies
cough or dysuria. There are no abnormalities of the breasts, lungs, costovertebral region, or skin incision. The uterine fundus is somewhat tender.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Endomyometritis.

➤

Most likely etiology of the condition: Ascending infection of vaginal
organisms (anaerobic predominance but also gram-negative rods).

➤

Best therapy for the condition: Intravenous antibiotics with anaerobic
coverage (eg, gentamicin and clindamycin).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know that the most common cause of fever for a woman who has undergone cesarean delivery is endomyometritis.
2. Know the mechanism of the endomyometritis, that is, ascending infection
of “polymicrobial” vaginal organisms.
3. Know that the differential diagnosis of fever in the woman who has undergone
cesarean delivery includes mastitis, wound infection, and pyelonephritis.

Considerations
This 24-year-old woman underwent cesarean delivery for arrest of dilation with
adequate uterine contractions (see Case 6 for criteria). She presumably had a
long labor, an intrauterine pressure catheter, and numerous vaginal examinations. These are all risk factors for the development of postpartum endomyometritis. On examination, she has a fever to 102°F (38.8°C). The scenario
reveals that there are no abnormalities of the breasts, which rules out mastitis.
The lungs are normal to auscultation, which speaks against atelectasis; in the
obstetric patient, atelectasis is an uncommon cause of postoperative fever since
the majority of cesarean deliveries are performed under regional anesthesia.
This patient’s wound appears normal. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness, so the likelihood of pyelonephritis is low. Urinary tract infections involving only the bladder do not usually cause fever. The uterus is only somewhat
tender, which does not overtly point to endomyometritis. However, when the
remainder of the examination does not reveal a focus, the majority of women
who have fever after cesarean delivery have endomyometritis.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Fever After Cesarean Delivery
DEFINITIONS
FEBRILE MORBIDITY: Temperature after cesarean delivery equal to or
greater than 100.4°F (38°C) taken on two occasions at least 6 hours apart,
exclusive of the first 24 hours.
ENDOMYOMETRITIS: Infection of the decidua, myometrium, and, sometimes,
the parametrial tissues.
SEPTIC PELVIC THROMBOPHLEBITIS: Bacterial infection of pelvic venous
thrombi, usually involving the ovarian vein.

CLINICAL APPROACH
A woman who has febrile morbidity after cesarean delivery most likely has
endomyometritis. The mechanism of infection is ascension of bacteria, a mixture of organisms from the normal vaginal flora. In other words, post-cesarean
delivery infection is almost always “polymicrobial,” with a mix of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The uterine incision site, being devitalized and
containing foreign material (ie, suture), is commonly the site for infection.
Typically, the fever occurs on postoperative day 2. When intra-amniotic
infection occurs during labor, the fever usually continues postpartum. The
patient may complain of abdominal tenderness or a foul-smelling lochia.
Uterine tenderness is common. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy especially with anaerobic coverage is important. Intravenous gentamicin and
clindamycin is a well-studied regimen and effective in 90% of cases. Other
choices include extended penicillins or cephalosporins. In contrast to postcesarean infection, endometritis after vaginal delivery does not necessarily
require anaerobic antimicrobial coverage, and ampicillin and gentamicin are
usually sufficient. Regardless of route of delivery, the fever usually improves
significantly after 48 hours of antimicrobial therapy. Enterococcal infection
may be one reason for nonresponse; ampicillin is the treatment for this organism and often is added if fever persists after 48 hours of therapy. If fever persists despite triple antibiotic therapy for 48 to 72 hours, then a CT scan of the
abdomen and pelvis may reveal an abscess or infected hematoma.
Another cause of fever after cesarean delivery is wound infection. Prophylactic
antibiotics given during surgery decrease the incidence. When a patient fails to
respond to antibiotic therapy, wound infection is the most likely etiology. The
fever usually occurs on postoperative day 4. Erythema or drainage may be present
in the wound site. The organisms are often the same as those involved with
endomyometritis. The treatment includes surgical opening of the wound (and

Evaluate for breast engorgement: Are breasts engorged, tender, red?
Evaluate for wound infection: Is the wound indurated, erythematous? Is there drainage?
Evaluate for endometritis: Is the uterus tender? Foul-smelling lochia?
If endometritis, begin intravenous gentamicin and clindamycin.
If no response in 48 h, reevaluate and if endometritis is still considered, add
ampicillin for enterococcus coverage.
If no response after 48 h of triple antibiotics, reevaluate (especially look for wound
infection). Consider CT imaging to assess for abscess, hematoma, or septic pelvic
thrombophlebitis.

dressing changes) and antimicrobial agents. The fascia must be inspected for
integrity. Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious life-threatening infection that can
affect the cesarean wound. Infections in the first 24 hours postoperatively can
implicate group A streptococcus, “so called ‘flesh eating bacteria.” Immediate
and extensive surgical debridement is indicated.
Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) is a rare bacterial infection affecting
thrombosed pelvic veins, usually the ovarian vessels. The bacterial infection
at the placental implantation site spreads to the ovarian venous plexuses or to
the common iliac veins, sometimes extending to the inferior vena cava.
Women with SPT may have a hectic fever and look well, or sometimes have
a palpable pelvic mass. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a CT scan or MRI.
Treatment includes antimicrobial therapy and some practitioners will also use
heparin therapy.
Other considerations in a febrile, postpartum woman should include
pyelonephritis (fever, flank tenderness, leukocytes in the urine), pelvic
abscess or infected pelvic hematoma, and breast engorgement (Table 50–1).

A 29-year-old woman is diagnosed with postpartum endometritis
based on fever, abdominal pain, fundal tenderness, and elimination of
other etiologies. Which of the following is the most significant risk
factor for postpartum endomyometritis?
A. Numerous vaginal examinations
B. Bacterial vaginosis
C. Cesarean delivery

50.3

A 27-year-old woman G1 P0 at 39 weeks’ gestation is noted to be in
labor. She underwent artificial rupture of membranes, and experiences
fetal bradycardia. Palpation of the vagina reveals a rope-like structure
prolapsing through the cervix. She is diagnosed with a cord prolapse
and underwent stat cesarean delivery. On postoperative day 2, the
patient has a temperature of 102°F (38.8°C), and is diagnosed with
endometritis. The patient who works in the microbiology laboratory
asks which of the following is the most commonly isolated bacteria in
her infection?
A. Bacteroides species
B. Staphylococcus aureus
C. Group B streptococcus
D. Escherichia coli

50.4

A 22-year-old woman who underwent cesarean delivery has persistent
fever of 102°F (38.8°C), despite the use of triple antibiotic therapy
(ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin). The urinalysis, wound,
breasts, and uterine fundus are normal on examination. A CT scan of
the pelvis is suggestive of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Which of the
following is the best therapy for this condition?
A. Hysterectomy
B. Discontinue antibiotic therapy and initiate intravenous heparin
C. Continue antibiotic therapy and begin intravenous heparin
D. Surgical embolectomy
E. Streptokinase therapy

ANSWERS
50.1

D. The best treatment of a wound infection is opening of the
wound. Prophylactic antibiotics given during surgery decrease the
likelihood of becoming infected. In addition to opening the wound,
the patient should undergo dressing changes and be started on
antimicrobial agents. The fascia must be inspected for integrity. In
cesarean wound infections, there are two distinct populations of
organisms that may be involved: skin organisms versus vaginal

406

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

organisms. A Gram stain of the wound may direct toward the correct
antibiotic regimen that would be effective for the possible bacteria.
50.2

C. Cesarean delivery greatly increases the risk of endometritis due
to the fact that the patient most likely had prolonged rupture of
membranes, numerous vaginal examinations, and an intrauterine
pressure monitor due, for example, to an arrest of labor. Endometritis
after vaginal delivery may occur as well, though less frequent, but
does not necessarily require anaerobic antimicrobial coverage; therefore, ampicillin and gentamicin are usually sufficient.

50.3

A. Anaerobic bacteria are the most commonly isolated organisms in
endomyometritis in patients who have undergone cesarean delivery.
The most common of these species is Bacteroides. The other organisms listed are aerobes.

50.4

C. Although there is no universal agreement, the best treatment for
septic pelvic thrombophlebitis seems to be the combination of
antibiotics and heparin. There are some practitioners who believe
that antibiotics alone are sufficient to treat SPT. Heparin alone is
not effective. Hysterectomy is not indicated.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common cause of fever after cesarean delivery is endomyometritis.
➤ The major organisms responsible for postcesarean endomyometritis are
anaerobic bacteria with the most commonly isolated organism bacteroides species.
➤ Atelectasis is rare in obstetric patients due to the large number of women
who have regional anesthesia.
➤ When fever in a cesarean patient persists on triple antibiotic therapy,
CT imaging should be performed.
➤ Antibiotic therapy and heparin are an accepted treatment for septic pelvic
thrombophlebitis.

Case 51
A 31-year-old woman comes in for a well-woman examination. Her last
menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She has no significant past medical or
surgical history. She denies having been treated for sexually transmitted
diseases. On examination, her blood pressure (BP) is 130/70 mm Hg,
heart rate (HR) 70 breaths per minute, and temperature is afebrile. Her
thyroid is normal on palpation. Her heart and lung examinations are
within normal limits. The abdomen is nontender and without masses.
Examination of the external genitalia reveals a nontender, firm, ulcerated lesion approximately 1 cm in diameter, with raised borders and an
indurated base located on the right labia majora. Bilateral inguinal
lymph nodes are also noted that are nontender. Her pregnancy test is
negative.

ANSWERS TO CASE 51:
Syphilitic Chancre
Summary: A 31-year-old woman who comes in for a well-woman examination
is noted to have a nontender, firm, 1-cm ulcerated lesion of the vulva; it has
raised borders and an indurated base. She also has bilateral, nontender inguinal
lymphadenopathy.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Syphilis (primary chancre).

➤

Next step in diagnosis: Syphilis serology (RPR or VDRL) and, if negative, darkfield microscopy.

➤

Best therapy for this condition: Intramuscular penicillin.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the classic appearance and presentation of the chancre lesion of primary syphilis.
2. Know that penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis.
3. Understand that the antibody tests (VDRL or RPR) may not yet turn positive with early syphilitic disease and that darkfield microscopy would then
be the diagnostic test of choice.

Considerations
This 31-year-old woman came in for a well-woman examination. It was unexpected to find the lesion in the vulvar area. The patient denies any history of
sexually transmitted diseases. Nevertheless, she has the classic lesion of primary syphilis, the painless chancre. It is typically a nontender ulcer with
clean-appearing edges, often accompanied by painless inguinal adenopathy.
In practice, the next step would be serology to assess for a nontreponemal
antibody test, such as the RPR or VDRL test. Occasionally, the patient will
have a negative nontreponemal test, in which case the next step is scraping
of the lesion for darkfield microscopy. Primary syphilis usually manifests itself
within 2 to 6 weeks after inoculation. The treatment for syphilis that is less
than 1-year duration is one set of injections of long-acting penicillin. If this
patient were older, for instance, in her postmenopausal years, squamous cell
carcinoma of the vulva would be considered. If the lesion were painful, herpes simplex virus would be the most common diagnosis.

Infectious Vulvar Ulcers
DEFINITIONS
NONTREPONEMAL TESTS: Nonspecific antitreponemal antibody test,

such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma
reagin (RPR) tests. These titers will fall with effective treatment.
SPECIFIC SEROLOGIC TESTS: Antibody tests that are directed against the treponemal organism such as the MHA-TP (micro-hemagglutinin antibody against
Treponema pallidum) and FTA-ABS (fluorescent-labeled treponemal antibody
absorption) tests. These tests will remain positive for life after infection.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The two most common infectious causes of vulvar ulcers in the United
States are herpes simplex virus and syphilis, with chancroid much less common. (See Figure 51–1 for an assessment algorithm.)

Herpes Simplex Virus
Genital herpes is a recurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) for which
there is no cure. It is the most prevalent STI in the United States. This organism is highly contagious, and it is thought that 20% of women in their childbearing years are infected. There are two types of herpes viruses, HSV type 1
and type 2. Type 1 usually causes infections in the oral region, and type 2 in
the genital region, however, cross-infection may occur. Recurrence is greater
with HSV type 2. The primary episode is usually a systemic as well as local disease, with the woman often complaining of fever or general malaise. Local
infection typically induces paresthesias before vesicles erupt on a red base. After
the primary episode, the recurrent disease is local, with less severe symptoms.
The recurrent herpes ulcers are small and superficial, and do not usually scar. The
best diagnostic test is viral culture. Rarely, the infections may be severe enough
to warrant hospitalization, such as with encephalopathy or urinary retention.
Treatment for immunosuppressed individuals often requires intravenous acyclovir therapy; oral acyclovir is effective in suppressing frequent recurrences.

Syphilis
Syphilis, caused by the bacteria T pallidum, may induce a chronic infection. The
organism is extremely tightly wound, and too thin to be seen on light
microscopy. The typical incubation period is 10 to 90 days. The disease can be
divided into primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. Primary syphilis
classically presents as the indurated, nontender chancre. The ulcer usually arises
3 weeks after exposure and disappears spontaneously after 2 to 6 weeks without
therapy. Nontreponemal tests (such as the RPR or VDRL) sometimes do not
become positive with the appearance of the chancre; if the serology is negative
in the face of a painless ulcer, then darkfield microscopy is an accepted diagnostic step. Another option is biopsy of the lesion with special stains for syphilis.
Secondary syphilis usually is systemic, occurring about 9 weeks after the
primary chancre. The classic macular papular rash may occur anywhere on the
body, but usually on the palms and soles of the feet, or the flat moist lesion of
condylomata lata on the vulva may be seen (Figure 51–2). These lesions have
a high concentration of spirochetes.
Latency of varying duration occurs after secondary disease; latency is subdivided into early latent (<1 year in duration), or late latent (>1 year).
If untreated, about one-third of women may proceed into tertiary syphilis,
which may affect the cardiovascular system or central nervous system. Optic
atrophy, tabes dorsalis, and aortic aneurysms are some of the manifestations.
Penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis. Because of the long replication time, prolonged therapy is required. For example, a long-acting penicillin,
benzathine penicillin G, is often used. One injection of penicillin 2.4 million
units intramuscularly is standard treatment for early disease (primary, secondary, and latent up to 1 year of duration). Patients with late-latent syphilis
(>1 year) should be treated with a total of 7.2 million units intramuscularly

divided as 2.4 million units every week for a total of three courses. For women
allergic to penicillin, oral erythromycin or doxycycline may be used (Table 51–1).
In pregnancy, penicillin is the only known effective treatment to prevent congenital syphilis.
Neurosyphilis requires more intensive therapy, usually intravenous penicillin in the hospital.
After therapy, the nontreponemal test is followed quantitatively every
3 months for at least 1 year. An appropriate response is a four-fold fall in titers
in 3 months, and a negative titer in 1 year. When the titer does not fall appropriately, one possible etiology is neurosyphilis, which may be diagnosed by
lumbar puncture.

Chancroid
Chancroid is a sexually transmitted disease, usually manifesting a soft, tender
ulcer of the vulva. Although common worldwide, it is very rare in the United
States. It is more common in males than in females. The typical ulcer is tender, with ragged edges on a necrotic base. Tender lymphadenopathy may also
coexist with these infections. The etiologic organism is Haemophilus ducreyi, a
small gram-negative rod. Gram stain usually reveals the classic “school of
fish.” After ruling out syphilis and herpes, chancroid should be suspected.
Biopsy and/or culture help to establish the diagnosis. Treatment includes oral
azithromycin or intramuscular ceftriaxone.

Comprehension Questions
51.1

A 19-year-old woman is noted to have a RPR titer of 1:16, and the
confirmatory (MHA-TP) test is positive. She had no history of
syphilis. She is treated with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units
intramuscularly. Three months after therapy, she is noted to have an
RPR titer of 1:2. The next month (4 months after treatment), the titer
is 1:1. Two months later, 6 months after treatment, the repeat RPR is
noted be 1:32. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Resistant organism
B. Inadequately treated syphilis
C. Laboratory error
D. Reinfection
E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

CLINICAL CASES

51.2

Which of the following statements about T pallidum is correct?
A. It is a protozoan.
B. Gram stain is a very sensitive method of diagnosis.
C. It causes neonatal disease mainly by direct inoculation of the baby
by the genital lesion.
D. Alternative treatments include doxycycline and erythromycin.

51.3

An 18-year-old G1 P0 at 14 weeks’ gestation is noted to have a positive RPR with a positive confirmatory MHA-TP test. The patient
states that she is allergic to penicillin, with hives and swelling of the
tongue and throat in the past. Which of the following is the most
appropriate next step?
A. Desensitize and treat with penicillin
B. Oral erythromycin
C. Oral doxycycline
D. Pretreat with prednisone, then administer penicillin
E. Intramuscular ceftriaxone

51.4

A 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with syphilis. She is noted to have
a persistently elevated RPR titer of 1:32, despite treatment with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units each week for a total of 3 weeks. She
complains of slight dizziness and a clumsy gait of 6 months duration.
Which of the following is the best test to diagnose neurosyphilis?
A. Plain x-ray films of the skull
B. Electroencephalograph (EEG)
C. CT scan of the head
D. Lumbar puncture
E. Psychiatric evaluation

ANSWERS
51.1

D. When RPR titers fall abruptly to therapy and then suddenly rise,
the most likely scenario is reinfection. It is common, however, for
individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus to have a positive RPR,
but they would not show the fluctuations in the titer as with this scenario. Syphilis has not been noted to become resistant to penicillin.

51.2

D. Alternatives to treatment for patients allergic to penicillin
include erythromycin and doxycycline. Syphilis is a spirochete and
not a protozoan. It is very thin and tightly wound and therefore not
visible on light microscopy.

51.3

A. Penicillin is the best treatment of syphilis in pregnancy. When
a pregnant woman with syphilis is allergic to penicillin, she should
undergo desensitization and receive penicillin. Penicillin is the only
known effective treatment for preventing congenital syphilis.

414

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

Doxycycline use may lead to discoloration of the child’s teeth, and
erythromycin has not been shown to be an effective treatment in
treating an infected fetus.
51.4

D. Typically, after a patient undergoes therapy for syphilis their RPR
titer does not fall appropriately, one possible etiology is neurosyphilis,
which may be diagnosed by lumbar puncture. The classic examination
of neurosyphilis is unsteady balance and Argyll Robertson pupils.
Cerebrospinal fluid for RPR may point toward neurosyphilis, although
there is no definitive test. Neurosyphilis requires more intensive therapy such as IV penicillin in the hospital.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Syphilis of less than 1 years’ duration can be treated with a single intramuscular course of penicillin; infection of greater than 1 years’ duration is
treated by three courses of penicillin at 1-week intervals.
➤ The nontender ulcer with indurated edges is typical for the chancre lesion of
primary syphilis. If serology is negative, then darkfield examination warranted.
➤ The best treatment for syphilis in pregnancy is penicillin.
➤ Pregnant women with syphilis and an allergy to penicillin should undergo
penicillin desensitization and then receive penicillin.
➤ The three most common infectious vulvar ulcers in the United States are
herpes simplex virus and syphilis, and much less common is chancroid.

ANSWERS TO CASE 52:
Intra-amniotic Infection
Summary: A 24-year-old G2 P1 woman at 30 weeks’ gestation was admitted
2 days ago for premature rupture of membranes. Her temperature is 100.8°F
(38.2°C). The uterine fundus is slightly tender. There is persistent fetal tachycardia in the 170 to 175 bpm range.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Intra-amniotic infection (chorioamnionitis).

➤

Best management for this patient: Intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin
and gentamicin) and induction of labor.

➤

Etiology of this condition: Ascending infection from vaginal organisms.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know that infection and labor are the two most common acute complications of preterm premature rupture of membranes.
2. Know the clinical presentation of intra-amniotic infection, and that fetal
tachycardia is an early sign of this infection.
3. Understand that broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and delivery are the
appropriate treatment of intra-amniotic infection.

Considerations
This 24-year-old woman at 30 weeks’ gestation has preterm premature rupture
of membranes. Upon presentation to the hospital, the practitioner should
assess for infection; in the absence of signs of infection, corticosteroid therapy
should be administered to reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome
(RDS). Additionally, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is given to help
reduce the incidence of intra-amniotic infection. Because the risk of prematurity outweighed the risk of infection, expectant management was chosen for
this patient. After 2 days in the hospital, the patient developed a fever, mild
uterine tenderness, and fetal tachycardia. These symptoms are consistent with
intra-amniotic infection. Upon recognition of this diagnosis, the patient
should be given intravenous antibiotic therapy, such as ampicillin and gentamicin. Neonates are most commonly affected by group B streptococci and
gram-negative enteric organisms such as Escherichia coli. Delivery is also an
important aspect of therapy for both neonatal and maternal well-being.
A vaginal delivery is acceptable, so induction of labor was chosen in this case.

Preterm Prom
DEFINITIONS
PREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES: Rupture of membranes prior to

the onset of labor.
PRETERM PREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES: Rupture of mem-

branes in a gestation less than 37 weeks, prior to onset of labor.
LATENCY PERIOD: The duration of time from rupture of membranes to

onset of labor.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is defined as rupture of
membranes prior to the onset of labor and at less than 37 weeks of pregnancy.
This complication occurs in about 1% of all pregnancies. Approximately onethird of preterm births are associated with PPROM. Risk factors are noted in
Table 52–1.
The history consistent with PPROM is that of a loss or “gush” of fluid per
vagina, which is very accurate and should be taken seriously. The diagnosis is
confirmed with a speculum examination showing the pooling of amniotic
fluid in the posterior vaginal vault, alkaline changes of the vaginal fluid, and
a ferning pattern of the fluid when seen on microscopy. Occasionally, the
speculum examination may be negative, but clinical suspicion is high; in
these cases, an ultrasound examination revealing oligohydramnios is consistent with PPROM.
The outcome is dependent on the gestational age. Approximately half of
patients with PPROM will go into labor within 48 hours, and 90% within
1 week. Complications of preterm delivery, such as respiratory distress syndrome,

are common. Other complications include chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, and necrotizing enterocolitis.
Chorioamnionitis affects about 1% of all pregnancies, and 7% to 10% of
those with PPROM with prolonged rupture of membranes. Maternal fever,
maternal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, and malodorous vaginal discharge
are some clinical indicators. An early sign is fetal tachycardia, a baseline
heart rate of greater than 160 bpm.
The treatment of PPROM is controversial. Prior to 32 weeks’ gestation,
antenatal steroids may be given to enhance fetal lung maturity in the absence
of overt infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy has been shown to delay
delivery and decrease the incidence of chorioamnionitis. Expectant management is undertaken when the risk of infection is thought to be less than the
risk of prematurity. After a gestational age of 34 to 35 weeks, the treatment is
usually delivery. Some of the risks of expectant management include stillbirth, cord accident, infection, and abruption. When infection is apparent,
broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin,
should be initiated and labor should be induced. Also, the infant should be
delivered when there is evidence of fetal lung maturity, such as by the presence of phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) on the vaginal pool amniotic fluid.

Comprehension Questions

A 31-year-old G1 P0 at 33 weeks’ gestation is admitted for preterm
premature rupture of membranes. Which of the following statements

A 32-year-old woman at 33 weeks’ gestation notes leakage of clear

phosphatidyl glycerol. Which of the following is the next step?
A. Expectant management
B. Intramuscular corticosteroids
C. Induction of labor
D. Ultrasound-guided amniocentesis

ANSWERS
52.1

C. Labor is the most common complication associated with PROM.
Antibiotics should be given to prolong the pregnancy and decrease
the risk of infection. The gestational age is greater than 32 weeks, so
no antenatal steroids are required. Vaginal candidiasis is not a risk
factor for PPROM; however, a lower socioeconomic status, STDs, cigarette smoking, cervical conization, emergency cerclage, multiple gestation, hydramnios, and placental abruption are risk factors.

52.2

C. Amniocentesis-revealing organisms on Gram stain are diagnostic of infection. A serum maternal leukocyte count may be at high
values suggestive of infections, but it would not be specific for an
intra-amniotic infection. Similarly, a speculum examination may
reveal an infectious-appearing vaginal discharge; however this would
neither confirm that an infection is present or that a specific type of
infection is present, especially since increased vaginal discharge is
common in pregnancy. Palpation of the maternal uterus and height
of an oral temperature would also not be diagnostic.

52.3

B. Listeria may induce chorioamnionitis without rupture of membranes; the mechanism is transplacental spread. A history of ingesting unpasteurized milk products (eg, some varieties of goat cheese)
should raise clinical suspicion of Listeria. Group B streptococci and
gram-negative enteric organisms such as E coli are the most common organisms to affect neonates.

versa. Severe oligohydramnios at an early gestational age can cause pulmonary hypoplasia. When fetal lung maturity is demonstrated on vaginal amniotic fluid by the presence of PG, delivery is the best next step
when there is leakage of fluid. Expectant management and intramuscular corticosteroids place the mother at an increased risk of developing an intra-amniotic infection. Corticosteroids suppress the immune
system, and expectant management prolongs the time frame that an
ascending infection from the vagina can cause an intra-amniotic infection. Expectant management is undertaken when the risk of infection
is thought to be less than the risk of prematurity, but this is not the case
for this scenario with a fetus that shows signs of lung maturity. There is
no indication for an ultrasound-guided amniocentesis.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Pregnancies complicated by premature rupture of membranes after 34- to
35-weeks gestation are usually managed by induction of labor.
➤ Pregnancies with PPROM less than 32-weeks gestation are usually managed expectantly.
➤ The earliest sign of chorioamnionitis (intra-amniotic infection) is usually
fetal tachycardia.
➤ Pregnancies complicated by PPROM and chorioamnionitis should be
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (like ampicillin and gentamicin)
and delivery.
➤ Clinical infection is a contraindication for corticosteroid use.

Case 53
An 18-year-old nulliparous woman complains of a vaginal discharge with
a fishy odor over the past 2 weeks. She states that the odor is especially
prominent after intercourse. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago.
She denies being treated for vaginitis or sexually transmitted diseases. She
is in good health and takes no medications other than an oral contraceptive agent. On examination, her blood pressure (BP) is 110/70 mm Hg,
heart rate (HR) 80 beats per minute, and temperature is afebrile. The
thyroid is normal to palpation. The heart and lung examinations are
normal. Her breasts are Tanner stage V as is the pubic and axillary hair.
The external genitalia are normal; the speculum examination reveals a
homogeneous, white vaginal discharge and a fishy odor. No erythema or
lesions of the vagina are noted.

ANSWERS TO CASE 53:
Bacterial Vaginosis
Summary: An 18-year-old nulliparous woman complains of a fishy vaginal discharge, which is worse after intercourse. The speculum examination reveals a
homogeneous, white vaginal discharge and a fishy odor. No erythema or
lesions of the vagina are noted.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Bacterial vaginosis (BV).

➤

Best treatment for this condition: Metronidazole orally or vaginally;
clindamycin is an alternative.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the three common infectious causes of vaginitis or vaginosis, which
are BV, Trichomoniasis, and Candida vulvovaginitis.
2. Know the diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis.
3. Know the treatments for the corresponding causes of vaginitis and vaginosis.

Considerations
This 18-year-old woman complains of a vaginal discharge that has a fishy
odor, which is the most common symptom of bacterial vaginosis. The discharge associated with BV has a typical white, homogenous vaginal coating,
described like “spilled milk over the tissue.” The pH is not given in this scenario. Also, although a whiff test is not performed with KOH, the worsening
of the discharge after intercourse is presumably due to the alkaline semen.
The vaginal epithelium is not erythematous or inflamed, which also fits with
bacterial vaginosis. Of the three most common causes of infectious vaginal
discharge (Candida, Trichomonas, and BV), bacterial vaginosis is the one etiology that is not inflammatory; there is a predominance of anaerobic bacteria
rather than a true infection. Hence, antibiotic therapy aimed at anaerobes,
such as metronidazole or clindamycin, is appropriate.

423

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Vaginal Infections
DEFINITIONS
BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS: Condition of excessive anaerobic bacteria in the
vagina, leading to a discharge that is alkaline.
CANDIDA VULVOVAGINITIS: Vaginal and/or vulvar infection caused by
Candida species, usually with heterogenous discharge and inflammation.
TRICHOMONAS VAGINITIS: Infection of the vagina caused by the protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis, usually associated with a frothy green discharge and
intense inflammatory response.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The three most common types of vaginal infections are bacterial vaginosis,
trichomonal vaginitis, and candidal vulvovaginitis (Table 53–1).
Bacterial vaginosis is not a true infection, but rather an overgrowth of
anaerobic bacteria, which replaces the normal lactobacilli of the vagina.
Although it may be sexually transmitted, this is not always the case. The most
common symptom is a fishy or “musty” odor, often exacerbated by menses or
intercourse, since both of these situations introduce an alkaline substance.
The vaginal pH is elevated above normal. The addition of 10% potassium
hydroxide (KOH) solution leads to the release of amines, causing a fishy odor

(whiff test). There is no inflammatory reaction; hence, the patient will not
complain of swelling or irritation, and typically, the microscopic examination
does not usually reveal leukocytes. Microscopy of the discharge in normal
saline (wet mount) typically shows clue cells (Figure 53–1), which are coccoid
bacteria adherent to the external surfaces of epithelial cells.
Bacterial vaginosis is associated with genital tract infection, such as
endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy complications, such
as preterm delivery and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Treatment
includes oral or vaginal metronidazole. Patients should be instructed to avoid
alcohol while taking metronidazole to avoid a disulfiram reaction.
Trichomonas vaginalis is a single-cell anaerobic flagellated protozoan that
induces an intense inflammatory reaction. It is a common sexually transmitted disease. Trichomonas vaginalis can survive for up to 6 hours on a wet surface. Aside from causing infection of the vagina, this organism can also
inhabit the urethra or Skene glands. The most common symptom associated
with trichomoniasis is a profuse “frothy” yellow-green to gray vaginal discharge or vaginal irritation. Intense inflammation of the vagina or cervix may
be noted, with the classic punctate lesions of the cervix (strawberry cervix).
A fishy odor is common with this disorder, which is somewhat exacerbated

with KOH. Microscopy in saline will often display mobile, flagellated organisms. If the wet mount is cold or there are excess leukocytes present, the
movement of the trichomonads may be inhibited. Optimal treatment consists
of a fairly high dose of metronidazole (2 g orally) as a one-time dose, with the
partner treated as well. Resistant cases may require the same dose every day
for 7 days. A newer anti-protozoal agent, Tinidazole, has a similar dosing, sideeffect profile, and contraindication for concurrent alcohol; due to its expense,
its main role is for metronidazole-resistant cases.
Candidal vaginitis is usually caused by the fungus, Candida albicans,
although other species may be causative. The lactobacilli in the vagina
inhibit fungal growth; thus, antibiotic therapy may decrease the lactobacilli
concentration, leading to Candida overgrowth. Diabetes mellitus, which suppresses immune function, may also predispose patients to these infections.
Candidiasis is usually not a sexually transmitted disease. The patient usually
presents with intense vulvar or vaginal burning, irritation, and swelling.
Dyspareunia may also be a prominent complaint. The discharge usually
appears curdy or like cottage cheese, in contrast to the homogenous discharge
of bacterial vaginosis. Also, unlike the alkaline pH of BV and Trichomonas
infection, the vaginal pH in candidiasis is typically normal (<4.5). The microscopic diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the hyphae or pseudohyphae
after the discharge is mixed with potassium hydroxide. The KOH solution
lyses the leukocytes and erythrocytes, making identification of the candidal
organisms easier. Treatment includes oral Diflucan or topical imidazoles, such
as terconazole (Terazol), or miconazole (Monistat).

likely diagnosis?
A. Candidal vaginitis
B. Trichomonal vaginitis
C. Bacterial vaginosis
D. Human papillomavirus
E. Herpes simplex virus

ANSWERS
53.1

C. There is a predominance of anaerobes in bacterial vaginosis. The
vaginal pH in BV usually is greater than 4.5, and the discharge is
homogenous. The most common symptom is a fishy or “musty” odor
when introduced to an alkaline substance (ie, 10% KOH, semen, or
menses). Clue cells are found on microscopy. BV is associated with
genital tract infection, such as endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and pregnancy complications, such as preterm delivery and
PPROM. Frothy discharge is more typical of trichomoniasis.

53.2

C. After antibiotic therapy, candidal organisms often proliferate and
may induce an overt infection. The mechanism is likely that the lactobacilli are eliminated by the antibiotic, allowing overgrowth of yeast.
Treatment of candidal vulvovaginitis is oral fluconazole or imidazole
cream. Metronidazole is used to treat BV and T vaginitis. Patients
should be instructed to avoid alcohol while taking metronidazole to
avoid a disulfiram reaction. Erythromycin may be used in the treatment
of syphilis in nonpregnant women allergic to penicillin. Clindamycin is
typically used in conjunction with gentamicin in the treatment of
infections requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics, necessitating anaerobic coverage (ie, postpartum endomyometritis). Hydrocortisone is most
commonly indicated for severe allergic reactions.

53.3

B. Trichomonas vaginalis is a hardy organism and may be isolated from
a wet surface up to 6 hours after inoculation. Its difficulty to kill is the
reason that therapy is metronidazole 2 gm orally all at once, to be able
to obtain sufficiently high tissue levels to be effective. Not uncommonly, a single course is not effective, and a 2- or 3-day course of
metronidazole a high dose orally is needed.

CLINICAL CASES

53.4

427

B. Erythematous vagina and punctations of the cervix (strawberry
cervix) are classic findings of the inflammatory effects induced by
trichomoniasis. Classic findings in candidal vaginitis include the
curdy or cottage cheese appearance of the vaginal discharge with
hyphae or pseudohyphae found on microscopy after discharge is
mixed with KOH. HPV is associated with findings of cervical dysplasia. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of infectious
vulvar ulcer disease in the United States.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The three most common types of vaginal infections are trichomoniasis,
candidal vaginitis, and bacterial vaginosis.
➤ Both BV and trichomoniasis is associated with alkaline pH and positive
whiff test.
➤ Candidal vulvovaginitis is a common infection in women who are pregnant,
taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, diabetic, or immunocompromised.
➤ Bacterial vaginosis is associated with preterm delivery, postpartum
endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease.
➤ Trichomonal vaginitis is associated with an intense inflammatory process
and may induce punctations of the cervix known as “strawberry cervix.”

Case 54
A 42-year-old parous woman has noticed increasing hair growth on her
face and abdomen over the past 8 months. She denies the use of steroid
medications, weight changes, or a family history of hirsutism. Her
menses previously had been monthly, and now occur every 35 to 70 days.
Her past medical and surgical histories are unremarkable. On examination, her thyroid is normal to palpation. She has excess facial hair and
male pattern hair on her abdomen. Acne is also noted on the face. The
cardiac and pulmonary examinations are normal. The abdominal examination reveals no masses or tenderness. Examination of the external
genitalia reveals possible clitoromegaly. Pelvic examination shows a
normal uterus and cervix and an 8-cm, right adnexal mass.

Hirsutism, Sertoli–Leydig Cell Tumor
Summary: A 42-year-old woman with an 8-month history of increasing hirsutism and irregular menses. She denies the use of steroid medications, weight
changes, or a family history of hirsutism. Pelvic examination shows an 8-cm,
right adnexal mass.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: An ovarian tumor, probable Sertoli–Leydig cell
tumor.

➤

Probable management: Ovarian cancer (surgical) staging.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the differential diagnosis of hirsutism.
2. Know the work-up and approach to a woman with virilism and hirsutism.
3. Know the typical history and physical examination for the various causes
of hirsutism.

Considerations
This 42-year-old woman has the onset of excess male-pattern hair over the
past 6 months, as well as features of virilism (clitoromegaly). This is evidence
of excess androgens. The rapid onset speaks of a tumor. Adrenal or ovarian
tumors are possibilities. This woman has a large adnexal mass, and so the diagnosis is straightforward. She has irregular menses because of the androgen
effect of inhibiting ovulation. The patient does not have the stigmata of
Cushing disease, such as hypertension, buffalo hump, abdominal striae, and
central obesity. Likewise, she does not take any medications containing anabolic steroids. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is probably the most
common cause of hyperandrogenism, but it does not fit this patient’s clinical
presentation. PCOS usually presents with a gradual onset of hirsutism and
irregular menses since menarche. A Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor of the ovary is
a solid stromal type of tumor, the androgen counterpart of granulosa-theca
cell tumor. These tumors are usually of low malignant potential and slow
growing, but nevertheless may metastasize and often recur. Hence, surgical
staging is the treatment of choice.

CLINICAL CASES

431

APPROACH TO
Hirsutism
DEFINTIONS
HIRSUTISM: Excessive male pattern hair in a female.
VIRILISM: Androgen effect other than hair pattern, such as cliteromegaly,

male balding, deepening of the voice, and acne.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hirsutism should be viewed as both an endocrine and cosmetic problem. It is
most commonly associated with anovulation; however, other causes of
increased androgen levels need to be ruled out, such as adrenal and ovarian diseases. The most sensitive marker of excess androgen production is hirsutism,
followed by acne, oily skin, increased libido, and virilization. Virilization consists of clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, balding, increased muscle mass,
and male body habitus. Adrenal hyperplasia or androgen-secreting tumors of
the adrenal gland or ovary are causes of virilization. The treatment depends
on the underlying etiology.
The pattern of hair growth is genetically predetermined. Differences in hair
growth between ethnic groups are secondary to variations in hair follicle concentration and 5-α-reductase activity. Hair growth can be divided into three
phases: anagen (growing phase), catagen (involution phase), and telogen (quiescent phase). Hair length is determined by the length of the anagen phase, and
the stability of hair is determined by the length of the telogen phase. Hair found
on the face, axilla, chest, breast, pubic area, and anterior thighs are termed “sex
hair” because they respond to sex hormones. Androgens (especially testosterone)
initiate growth of and increase the diameter and pigmentation of “sex hair.”
Androgens may be produced by the ovary, adrenal gland, or by peripheral conversion. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is derived almost exclusively from the adrenal gland. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is metabolized from
testosterone by 5-α-reductase; increased activity of 5-α-reductase leads to an
increase in DHT and stimulation of hair growth. The majority of testosterone is
bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and it is the unbound portion
that is primarily responsible for androgenicity. Hyperandrogenism decreases
SHBG, and thus, exacerbates hirsutism.
The appearance and cosmetic changes associated with hirsutism depend
on the number of follicles present, ratio of growth to resting phases, asynchrony of growth cycles, and thickness and degree of pigmentation of individual hairs. The history should focus on the onset and duration of symptoms
(faster growth is associated with tumors of adrenal and ovary, whereas slow

432

CASE FILES: O b s t e t r i c s a n d Gy n e c o l o g y

onset since menarche is more likely polycystic ovarian syndrome). The severity of symptoms should be characterized (eg, virilization is rare and is usually
associated with androgen-secreting tumors). The regularity of the menses and
symptoms of thyroid disease should also be sought. The physical examination
should focus on the location of hair growth and its severity, thyromegaly, body
shape and habitus, the presence of breast discharge, skin changes (acanthosis
or abdominal striae), adnexal or abdominal masses, and the external genitalia.
Helpful laboratory tests include assays for serum testosterone, dihydroepiandrostenedione sulfate (DHEA-S), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (which is
elevated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia), prolactin, and TSH. A markedly
elevated testosterone level suggests an androgen-secreting ovarian tumor, such
as a Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor. With a high DHEA-S level, the examiner should
be suspicious of an adrenal process, such as adrenal hyperplasia or a tumor.
The differential diagnosis for hirsutism (Table 54–1) includes anovulation,
late-onset adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors (adrenal or ovarian in
origin), Cushing disease, medications, thyroid disease, and hyperprolactinemia.
A genetic defect in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase causes most of the cases of
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). While classic CAH is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in the newborn, late-onset of nonclassical
CAH can present in adult females with symptoms of hirsutism and anovulation. An elevated morning fasting 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is highly

suggestive of CAH. Treatment depends on the etiology; however, in general,
the goal is to decrease the amount of DHT available. This can be accomplished by inhibiting adrenal or ovarian androgen secretion, changing SHBG
binding, impairing peripheral conversion of androgen to active androgen, and
inhibiting activity at target tissues. Treatment options include weight loss,
combined oral contraception pills, spironolactone (a diuretic that is an androgen antagonist), progesterone-containing medications, electrolysis, laser
vaporization, waxing, and shaving. The patient must be warned that there is
a slow response to treatment with medications (an average of 6 months). To
help with more immediate results, nonmedical therapies (waxing and shaving) may be used initially until the new medication begins to work effectively.

most likely diagnosis?
A. Polycystic ovarian syndrome
B. Familial hirsutism
C. Ovarian tumor
D. Adrenal tumor
E. Cushing syndrome

ANSWERS
54.1

E. Isosexual (no virilization) precocious puberty with an adnexal
mass usually is a granulosa cell tumor of the ovary. Dermoid cysts are
also found on the ovary. They present as a pelvic mass that causes pain
due to its rapidly enlarging size, however they do not cause isosexual
precocious puberty. A Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor is the androgen
counterpart to the granulose-theca cell tumor. With a Sertoli–Leydig
cell tumor, testosterone levels are markedly elevated and patients typically present with hirsutism, virilism, and an adnexal mass.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in the newborn; however, late onset can present in adult
females with symptoms of hirsutism and anovulation.

54.2

C. The most common neonatal endocrine cause of death (salt wasting)
is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency).
An elevated testosterone level would be found with a Sertoli–Leydig
cell tumor. A dexamethasone suppression test is used in the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. An elevated LH-FSH ration is found with
PCOS. A karyotype may be used in finding the etiology behind a
young girl’s presentation of primary amenorrhea or pubertal delay.

54.3

D. Most likely polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS); the initial
treatment for infertility is clomiphene citrate. Since the symptoms
were not of rapid onset, the etiology is not likely to involve a tumor.
Intrauterine insemination is usually indicated for the rare cervical
factor infertility, and not ovulatory disfunction.

54.4

A. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is the most common cause of hirsutism
and irregular menses. Treatment may be spironolactone (androgen antagonist) and oral contraceptives. Familial hirsutism usually is not associated
with oligomenorrhea or an abnormal LH/FSH ratio. Symptoms do not
correlate with an ovarian tumor (since the patient has abnormal hair
growth, hirsutism); also, laboratory values indicate normal adrenal function, thus ruling out adrenal tumor and Cushing syndrome.

CLINICAL CASES

Clinical Pearls
➤ The rapid onset of hirsutism or virilization usually indicates the presence of
an androgen-secreting tumor.
➤ The two most common locations of androgen production and secretion
are the ovary and the adrenal gland.
➤ The most common cause of hirsutism and irregular menses is polycystic
ovarian syndrome.
➤ The most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in the newborn is congenital adrenal hyperplasia, usually due to 21-hydroxlase enzyme deficiency.
➤ Hyperandrogenism in the face of an adnexal mass usually indicates a
Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor of the ovary, and is treated surgically.

ANSWER TO CASE 55:
Serum Screening in Pregnancy
Summary: A 20-year-old G1 P0 woman at 16 weeks’ gestation by a fairly certain last menstrual period has received a serum maternal α-fetoprotein test
that returned as 2.8 multiples of the median.
➤

Next diagnostic step: Basic obstetric ultrasound examination to assess for
dates and multiple gestations.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that the most common causes of abnormal serum screening are
wrong dates and multiple gestations.
2. Know that an elevated maternal serum α-fetoprotein (msAFP) level may
be associated with an open neural tube defect.
3. Know that a low msAFP level may be associated with fetal Down syndrome.

Considerations
This patient is at 16 weeks’ gestation by a fairly certain last menstrual period,
which is consistent with the clinical examination. The gestational age window of
16 to 20 weeks is the appropriate time to screen with serum testing. The msAFP
returned as 2.8 multiples of the median (MOM), which exceeds the usual cut-off
of 2.0 or 2.5 MOM. The interpretation of the msAFP depends on gestational age
and number of fetuses. The components of a certain last menstrual period are:
(1) patient sure of date of last menstrual period (LMP), (2) regular menses,
(3) LMP was normal, (4) patient has had no spotting or bleeding after LMP. The
uterine size correlates with the dates. At 16 weeks’ gestation, the fundus is usually
midway between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus. At 20 weeks’ gestation,
the fundal height is generally at the level of the umbilicus. Although this patient
has a sure LMP and size and date consistency, there is still a significant risk of a
dating abnormality or a multifetal gestation. Hence, the next appropriate step is
the basic ultrasound examination. If there is a dating error, the msAFP result
would be recalculated based on the corrected gestational age. If the msAFP is still
abnormally elevated, then at an early gestational age such as 16 weeks, repeating
the serum test is an option. For women with abnormally elevated msAFP at a later
gestational age, such as 20 weeks, genetic counseling and referral for amniocentesis may be considered.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Abnormal Serum Screening in Pregnancy
DEFINITIONS
ALPHA-FETOPROTEIN: A glycoprotein made by the fetal liver, analogous

to the adult albumin.
FIRST-TRIMESTER SCREENING: Use of biochemical markers and/or trans-

vaginal sonography measuring the aspect in the posterior neck region called
the “nuchal translucency” giving a risk of Down syndrome and trisomy 18.
NEURAL TUBE DEFECT: Failure of closure of the embryonic neural folds
leading to an absent cranium and cerebral hemispheres (anencephaly) or
nonclosure of the vertebral arches (spina bifida).
OPEN NEURAL TUBE DEFECT: A neural tube defect that is not covered by
skin.
MATERNAL SERUM α-FETOPROTEIN: α-Fetoprotein level drawn from maternal blood; this may be elevated due to increased amniotic fluid α-fetoprotein.
TRISOMY SCREEN: Three or four serum markers that may indicate an increased
risk of chromosomal abnormalities. A common combination includes maternal
serum α-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, inhibin-A, and unconjugated estriol.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The triple (or trisomy) screen is used in pregnant women between 15 and
21 weeks’ gestation to identify those pregnancies that may be complicated by
neural tube defects, Down syndrome, or trisomy 18. It is a multiple marker
test, and the term “triple” is often used to denote that it analyzes three chemicals in the maternal serum to determine the risk for neural tube defects or
fetal aneuploidy: α-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG), and unconjugated estriol. Although the triple screen may be offered
to women over the age of 35 years, or advanced maternal age, genetic amniocentesis provides more diagnostic information.
α-Fetoprotein is a glycoprotein synthesized initially by the fetal yolk sac
and then later by the fetal gastrointestinal tract and liver. It passes into the
maternal circulation by diffusion through the chorioamniotic membranes.
When there is an opening in the fetus not covered by skin, levels of AFP
increase in the amniotic fluid and maternal serum. Maternal serum AFP is
measured in multiples of the median (MOM). Different laboratories have different cut-off levels for abnormal AFP; in general, levels greater than 2.0 to
2.5 MOM are suspicious for neural tube defects and warrant further evaluation.

However, an abnormally elevated serum AFP level does not necessarily coincide with fetal neural tube defects. Other causes of elevated maternal serum
AFP are listed in Table 55–1.
In contrast to neural tube defects, which have an abnormally elevated
maternal serum AFP, those pregnancies complicated by Down syndrome have
a low maternal serum AFP. Again, other causes of abnormally decreased levels of AFP have been identified and are listed in Table 55–2.
Unconjugated estriol is also decreased in fetuses with Down syndrome.
Human chorionic gonadotropin, however, is elevated in these fetuses. By
combining these serum chemicals into a multiple marker screening test,
approximately 60% of all Down syndrome pregnancies can be identified.
With trisomy 18, all of the serum markers are abnormally low. Different variations of the multiple marker test exist, such as one that adds inhibin A as a
fourth analyte to further improve detection rates.
Recently, first-trimester Down syndrome screening has become available to
women. This allows prediction of abnormal pregnancies at an earlier gestational
age. First-trimester screening combines two serum analytes: pregnancy-associated
plasma protein (PAPP-A) and free β-hCG with sonographic measurement of
nuchal translucency. The nuchal translucency is an echolucent area seen at the
back of the fetal neck. In abnormal pregnancies, the levels of PAPP-A and free
β-hCG tend to be decreased, whereas the nuchal translucency is thickened.
When performed between 10- to 13 weeks’ gestation, 85% of Down syndrome
may be identified, and 90% of trisomy 18 may be identified. Furthermore, firsttrimester screening may be combined with second-trimester screening to
improve the detection rate of Down syndrome to 90%.
The first step in the management of an abnormal triple screen is a basic
ultrasound to determine the correct gestational age, to identify the possibility
of multiple gestation, and to exclude fetal demise. The most common cause of
abnormal serum screening is wrong dating. If the risk of trisomy or neural tube
defects is still increased after a basic sonogram, amniocentesis or targeted
ultrasound is offered. A targeted examination can correctly identify fetuses
with neural tube defects by direct visualization of the fetal head and spine.

Furthermore, ultrasound may also detect those fetuses suspicious for having
Down syndrome by identification of a thickened nuchal fold, shortened femur
length, or echogenic bowel. Other conditions associated with an abnormally
high or low maternal serum AFP, such as abdominal wall defects, oligohydramnios, and fetal skin defects, can be identified with ultrasound.
Because high-resolution sonography can detect up to 95% of neural tube
defects, some practitioners will not proceed with invasive testing for an elevated msAFP. However, when amniocentesis is chosen for an elevated
msAFP, the amniotic fluid is tested for AFP levels. Fetal karyotype is also
obtained through amniocentesis, which will identify fetal aneuploidy, such as
the trisomies. Fetal loss rate from an amniocentesis is about 0.5%. Other complications include rupture of membranes and chorioamnionitis.
The identification of a fetus affected by a neural tube defect or a chromosomal abnormality can be an ethical and moral dilemma for the parents,
whose previous hopes and dreams for having a “normal” child are now extinguished. The parents should not be forced into any decision, but should be
provided information in an unbiased fashion.

ANSWERS
55.1

C. This baby has the “double bubble” of duodenal atresia. The
hydramnios results from the inability of the baby to swallow.
Duodenal atresia is strongly associated with fetal Down syndrome.
Gestational diabetes is associated with hydramnios occasionally;
however, duodenal atresia is not related. Rh isoimmunization can
also lead to hydramnios and hydrops but not duodenal atresia.

55.2

E. The genetics for cleft palate and cleft lip in the absence of other
anomalies is multifactorial,

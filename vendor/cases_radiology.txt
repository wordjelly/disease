CASE 1:

DETERIORATING SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN A SMOKER

History
You are asked to review a 72-year-old man on the post-take ward round. He was admitted last night with increasing shortness of breath. His breathing has been getting worse
for many years now, and he notices that it is especially bad in the winter. His general
practitioner (GP) has diagnosed asthma and has been managing him at home. He recalls
having several courses of antibiotics over the last few years.
His recent problems started 3 days ago with a cough productive of green sputum. He has
felt generally unwell and his breathing has deteriorated significantly. He cannot climb
the stairs at home now and slept on the sofa last night. His GP saw him this morning and
referred him to hospital as an infective exacerbation of asthma. He continues to smoke
despite advice, and has a 50 pack-year history. There is no other relevant past medical
history. He takes a salbutamol inhaler when needed but today this was of little help.

Examination
Some blood tests were performed and a chest radiograph was requested (Figure 1.1). His
white cell count is 16.3 × 109/L, neutrophil count 89 per cent and haemoglobin 14.2 g/dL.

Figure 1.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does this radiograph show?
• What is the likely diagnosis and how can this be confirmed?
1

ANSWER 1
This is a posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph of an adult male. The lungs are hyperexpanded as evidenced by visualizing more than six anterior ribs above the diaphragm.
The distance between the apex of the hemidiaphragm and a line drawn from the costophrenic to the cardiophrenic angle is less than 1.5 cm, in keeping with diaphragmatic
flattening. The lung parenchyma demonstrates bullous emphysematous disease, most
marked in the upper zones. There is no evidence of consolidation, collapse or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal borders are within normal limits, and both hila are of
normal morphology. This chest radiograph suggests a diagnosis of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD).
COPD is a combination of increased mucus production, small airway obstruction and
emphysematous change, with a slow and progressive history of increasing shortness
of breath, usually in association with significant tobacco usage. Most commonly, the
emphysematous component is ‘centrilobular’, with irreversible destruction of normal lung
most in the apical segments of the upper lobes. On computed tomography (CT) this is
clearly seen as central black holes of destroyed lung ‘punched-out’ from normal parenchymal architecture (Figure 1.2), although a CT is not a necessary investigation in most
cases of COPD. Sometimes the clinical symptoms of COPD are confused with asthma,
which usually starts in childhood and shows greater reversibility of airflow obstruction.
Some patients develop asthma later in life, and in practice both conditions may coexist
or be difficult to differentiate.
The most important investigation in a
patient with COPD is lung function testing. Spirometry shows the reduced forced
expiratory volume in 1 second : forced
vital capacity (FEV1 : FVC) ratio characteristic of obstructive conditions. There is
an increase in the total lung capacity (TLC)
and residual volume (RV) in COPD as a
result of air trapping.
Reversibility to bronchodilators is limited
in COPD. Assessment of functional capacity is an important part of the evaluation
in chronic COPD. In acute exacerbations
such as that described, it is important to
assess blood gases to look for significant
hypoxia and/or carbon dioxide retention.

Figure 1.2 CT scan.

KEY POINTS

• Flattening of the diaphragms and lung hyperexpansion are characteristic chest
radiograph features of COPD.

• COPD is a combination of increased mucus production, small airways obstruction and
emphysematous change.

• Lung function tests are the most important investigation in a patient with COPD.

CASE 2:

THE BREATHLESS ASTHMATIC

History
A 36-year-old woman presented to the accident and emergency department complaining
of progressively increasing breathlessness over the last 2 weeks. This was accompanied by
a wheeze and cough productive of white sputum. Her exercise tolerance had reduced and
she denied any orthopnoea or chest pain. She had a history of asthma which was usually
well controlled with inhalers and had never previously required a hospital attendance.
There was no other history of note and she denied ever being a smoker. She lived at home
with her husband and two children.
Examination
On examination, her respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute. She was afebrile and
normotensive with a regular pulse rate of 88 per minute. Her cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were normal, but on auscultation of her lungs there was a prolonged
expiratory wheeze with reduced air entry at the left base.
A chest radiograph was performed as part of her initial investigations (Figure 2.1).

Figure 2.1 PA chest radiograph.

Questions
• What radiological abnormality is present?
• What is the most likely cause considering her history?

3

ANSWER 2
This patient has left lower lobe collapse. Depending on the airway obstructed, each lobe
collapses in a characteristic way. This was originally described by Benjamin Felson, a
professor of radiology in the United States in 1973. In the case of the left lower lobe,
when there is proximal occlusion, the lobe collapses posteriorly and medially towards the
spine. Lying behind the heart, it assumes a triangular shape with a straight lateral border
being classically described as a ‘sail sign’ on posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph as
shown in Figure 2.2.
It usually overlies the cardiac shadow and
can be easily missed on poorly windowed or
under-penetrated films. The collapsed lobe
obscures the left medial hemidiaphragm
and the horizontal fissure swings downwards with the hilar displaced inferiorly.
Other features to help confirm the diagnosis
would include mediastinal and tracheal
shift towards the side of the collapse, and
possible herniation of the contralateral
lung across the midline from compensatory
hyperinflation. The degree of hilar depression and compensatory hyperaeration is
variable depending on the degree of collapse. Less commonly, a stenosing bronchogenic tumour may be seen as a soft tissue
density overlying the left hilar point.

Figure 2.2 PA chest radiograph with ‘sail sign’
indicated.

The causes of lobar collapse are numerous; incidence varies with age and clinical history.
Overall, the commonest cause of collapse is related to a proximal stenosing bronchogenic
carcinoma, and although the majority of lung cancer is seen in men, the incidence in
women is rising. Lung cancer is rarely diagnosed in people younger than 40, but the
incidence rises steeply thereafter with most cases (85 per cent) occurring in people over
the age of 60 with a past medical history of smoking. In ventilated patients, including
neonates, malpositioning of the endotracheal tube can aerate one lung and occlude the
contralateral side, while in infants, collapse related to an inhaled foreign body (e.g. a
peanut) should always be considered. In older children and young adults, the commonest
cause of lobar collapse is as a complication of asthma.
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by reversible airflow limitation
and airway hyperresponsiveness. In response to immunological stimuli, mucus hypersecretion from goblet cell hyperplasia can cause airway plugging. Proximal occlusion of
a bronchus causes loss of aeration, and as the residual air is gradually absorbed, the lung
volume reduces with eventual collapse. Considering the patient’s age and clinical history,
this is the most likely cause of her left lower lobe collapse.
KEY POINTS

• Depending on the airway affected, each lobe collapses in a characteristic way.
• The ‘sail sign’ on a PA chest radiograph is indicative of left lower lobe collapse.
• In paediatric cases, always consider inhaled foreign body as a possible cause of lobar
collapse.

CASE 3:

AN ICY FALL

History
A 39-year-old woman is sent for an X-ray following a fall. She slipped on some ice while
out shopping and raised her right hand to break the fall but her little finger was hyperflexed in the palm of her hand. She felt an instant sharp and stabbing pain in her little
finger, which was centred over the distal and interphalangeal joints. Over the next few
hours, her finger began to swell and was increasingly uncomfortable. No other injury was
sustained and she attended her local general practitioner (GP) practice for further advice.
Examination
On examination there was soft tissue swelling and a partially flexed little finger that the
patient was unable to completely straighten. There was no evidence of skin breach and
the patient was otherwise fit and healthy. Concerned that a fracture had been sustained,
the GP referred her to hospital for an X-ray and definitive treatment (Figure 3.1a,b).

(b)

Figure 3.1 (a) Oblique and (b) lateral radiographs of right little finger.

Questions
• What does this radiograph show?
• What other sites are commonly involved in this form of injury?
• How are X-rays made?
5

ANSWER 3
Figure 3.1a is a single oblique radiograph of the right little finger of adequate quality and
penetration. There is partial flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) with a small
bony fragment seen in the dorsal aspect of the distal phalynx that is separated from the
parent bone. Reduced cortication of the separated surfaces in association with generalized soft tissue swelling is in keeping with an acute fracture, and the bony fragment has
been retracted proximally. These appearances are most likely related to a hyperflexion
injury, with a fragment of bone avulsed by the extensor tendon at its insertion into the
distal phalynx. In summary, there is an avulsion fracture to the distal phalynx of the
right little finger.
The term ‘avulsion’ is used medically to describe one part of the body forcibly detached
from another in response to trauma. Commonly seen in the accident and emergency
department related to skin degloving from road traffic accidents and nail bed trauma
from a crush injury, radiological avulsion fractures occur when a bony fragment is separated from the parent bone in response to forcible contraction of a ligament or tendon.
During puberty, secondary ossification centres lay down advancing margins of new bone
for continued growth and development, with muscle insertions at this site forming the
‘apophysis’. The newly ossified bone is a site of weakness and is vulnerable to separation
under extreme force. Any bone subjected to a forceful and usually unbalanced muscle
contraction is subject to potential injury, however avulsion fractures are most often seen
in active adolescent children commonly at muscle insertions into the pelvis. Sprinters,
footballers and tennis players are at greatest risk of such injury. The three commonest
sites of pelvis apophyseal avulsion, as shown in Figure 3.2, are:
• ischial tuberosity at the insertion of the adductor magnus muscle of the hamstring;
• anterior inferior iliac iliac spine at the insertion of the rectus femoris muscle; and
• anterior superior iliac spine at the sartorius muscle insertion.

First discovered by the German physicist W.C. Roentgen in 1895, the discovery of X-rays
changed the landscape of medicine forever. To train as a radiologist, the basic physics of
X-ray production need to be understood. Every atom is made up of a positively charged
nucleus with numerous negatively charged electrons of different energy levels electrostatically held in place around it. Superheating a metal filament (e.g. tungsten) allows
a negatively charged electron to free itself from the atom, and this can be accelerated
along an X-ray tube attracted by a positively charged ‘anode’ target plate (also commonly
made of tungsten). The fast-moving electron strikes the target plate with such force that
it can eject a static electron from a target plate atom out of its normal stable trajectory
around its nucleus. This makes the target atom unstable, and to protect itself, another
static electron encircling the same nucleus will demote itself from a higher energy band
to plug the hole left by the ejected electron. In doing so, it releases energy in the form of
a single photon called an ‘X-ray’.
Rapidly repeating this procedure can generate an X-ray beam, which when passed
through a human body can generate an image on X-ray sensitive material, as the X-rays
interact with tissues of differing densities (e.g. bone versus fat).

KEY POINTS

• Avulsion describes the forcible detachment of one part of the body from another in
response to trauma.

• A high index of suspicion of a pelvic apophyseal avulsion in athletic but skeletally
immature adolescents is advisable.

• X-Rays were discovered in 1895 by W.C. Roentgen.

CASE 4:

DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING

History
A 75-year-old man presents complaining of difficulty swallowing together with intermittent regurgitation of undigested food, often some time after eating. This has been slowly
worsening. There is occasionally choking and coughing at night. There is no associated
pain or heart burn and no history of weight loss or chest symptoms. He has a 30 packyear smoking history.
Examination
He looks well. The neck and chest examination is normal. No oropharyngeal abnormality
is seen on visual examination. The abdomen is soft and non-tender.
A recent chest X-ray is unremarkable. You organize a contrast swallow test (Figure 4.1).

Questions
• What differential diagnosis should be considered?
• What do the images demonstrate?
• What other investigations can be used and what are their relative benefits?

9

ANSWER 4
The differential diagnosis for dysphagia is usefully split up into anatomical regions corresponding with the phases of swallowing (i.e. oral, pharyngeal and oesophageal). The
type of symptom and the most appropriate investigations depend on whether the problem
is primarily oropharyngeal or oesophageal.
Oropharyngeal dysphagia can be caused by:
• central neurological disorders such as stroke, brainstem tumours or degenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Huntington’s disease);
• peripheral neurological disorders including peripheral neuropathy, poliomyelitis and
syphilis;
• systemic disorders such as myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis or muscular dystrophy;
• oropharyngeal lesions including cricopharyngeal achalasia, tumours, inflammatory
masses, Zenker’s diverticulum, oesophageal webs, extrinsic structural lesions, anterior
mediastinal masses and cervical spondylosis; see Case 66.
Oesophageal dysphagia can be caused by:
• achalasia;
• spastic motor disorders, such as diffuse oesophageal spasm, hypertensive lower
oesophageal sphincter and nutcracker oesophagus;
• scleroderma;
• obstructive lesions, such as tumours, strictures, lower oesophageal rings (Schatzki
rings), oesophageal webs, foreign bodies, vascular compression and mediastinal
masses.
Endoscopy is the investigation of choice for both oropharyngeal dysphagia, which is
typically investigated in the ear, nose and throat department, and oesophageal dysphagia,
which is investigated in the upper GI gastroenterology department. If endoscopy does not
provide the answer, or the patient refuses the test, then a contrast swallow test can be
done to visualize swallowing function. Videofluoroscopy is a low X-ray dose film of the
very fast swallowing action in the oropharynx and is useful if there is a motor problem
or unsafe swallow. A barium swallow is a series of images taken of the oesophagus while
swallowing barium contrast.
This patient’s symptoms are suggestive of a pharyngeal or oesophageal problem. On the
fluoroscopy images there is barium pooling in an oesophageal diverticulum arising from
the posterior midline of the upper oesophagus, the typical position for a pharyngeal
pouch (Zenker’s diverticulum). This is thought to be caused by spasm or uncoordinated
peristalsis of the upper oesophageal sphincter and is located in Killian’s triangle, formed
by the overlap of the oblique muscles of the inferior constrictor muscle and the transverse
muscle fibres of the cricopharyngeus muscle.
The patient’s symptoms probably reflect progressive increase in size and compressive
effect of the pouch. There is also increased risk of aspiration. The treatment is usually
surgical excision or endoscopic stapling. The cricopharyngeal muscle may be separated to
prevent recurrence. Complications of pouches include aspiration and, rarely, a carcinoma
within the pouch.
Diverticula in other positions are possible. A Killian–Jamieson diverticulum is a lateral
cervical oesophageal diverticulum just a little lower in position. Pulsion diverticula asso10

ciated with abnormal oesophageal contractions sometimes form in the lower third of the
oesophagus. Pseudodiverticula are rare dilated glandular pouches in the mucosa of the
mid oesophagus associated with reflux.
KEY POINTS

• Although endoscopy is the investigation of choice, contrast swallow tests provide
•

evidence of functional problems that may not be seen on endoscopy and often
underlie dysphagia.
Common symptoms of a pouch are dysphagia, regurgitation and cough.

CASE 5:

A MECHANICAL FALL IN AN ELDERLY PATIENT

History
An 81-year-old woman is bought into the accident and emergency department by ambulance from a local nursing home. As a long-term resident of the home she is an active
participant in daily activities, and is usually self-caring and independent. Yesterday
evening, she sustained a witnessed mechanical fall, tripping over the walking stick of
another resident. Despite a small graze to the right side of the head, there was no loss of
consciousness and the patient reassured care home staff that she was fine. An incident
report was filed. During the night the patient took paracetamol for pain control of a
headache but no further action was taken.
In the morning, she complained of continued headache and the care staff noted a general
listlessness and drowsiness. During the course of the day this progressed, and the patient
was found slumped in her chair before lunch, rousable only to strong verbal commands.
Staff were worried and called an ambulance.

Examination
On inspection the patient had a superficial graze to the right side of her forehead. Her
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 11 (motor 5, eyes 3, speech 3). She was apyrexial, pulse
76 regular, normotensive with a normal cardiovascular examination. There was no focal
neurological deficit, and both pupils were equal and reactive. An unenhanced computed
tomography (CT) scan was performed (Figure 5.1).

Figure 5.1 Unenhanced CT scan.

Questions
• What does the CT scan demonstrate?
• What is the diagnosis and treatment?
13

ANSWER 5
This is a single unenhanced image from a cranial CT scan at the level of the basal ganglia.
There is an area of asymmetry between the inner table of the skull and the brain in the left
cerebral hemisphere. This is more dense than adjacent brain parenchyma but not as dense as
the calcified bones of the skull. It conforms to the skull in a concave shape and is predominantly homogeneous in appearance. The adjacent sulci are effaced, as they are not traceable
to the brain surface compared to the contralateral side. There is also slight effacement of
the left lateral ventricle with some mild midline shift to the right. The brain parenchyma
demonstrates preserved grey/white matter differentiation, and there is some generalized
cerebral atrophy, demonstrated by increased sulcal spaces seen in the normal right cerebral
hemisphere. These findings are in keeping with a subdural haemorrhage with mass effect.
Subdural haemorrhage is defined as a collection of blood in the space between pia mater
and dura mater of the leptomeninges.
Laceration of the veins between the two inner layers of the meninges causes blood to
accumulate in the subdural space. Although there is an association with direct head
trauma and penetrating injury, subdural haematomas are most commonly seen within
the elderly population. The brain atrophies with age and becomes more mobile within the
skull. The bridging cortical veins are stretched, increasing the risk of both spontaneous
rupture and disruption after trivial head injury. Blood is free to track along the surface of
the brain within the subdural space and is limited only by the falx and tentorium cerebellum. Cranial CT demonstrates a concave haematoma that, unlike an extradural haemorrhage, crosses suture lines within the skull. The haematoma can have a varied attenuation
pattern depending on whether it is an acute, subacute or chronic subdural haemorrhage.
For example, Figure 5.2 demonstrates bilateral chronic subdural haemorrhages. In some
cases where there is rebleeding, layering of
old and fresh blood can be seen, demonstrating an acute-on-chronic picture.
These types of intracranial bleeds tend to
be venous in aetiology and blood accumulates slowly in the subdural space.
Treatment depends on the neurological deficit caused by the haemorrhage.
Patients commonly present with headache,
sleepiness and personality change, but
if the bleed is large, the conscious level
can fluctuate. Signs and symptoms of
raised intracranial pressure can occur late
and should alert clinicians to the need of
urgent evacuation and decompression via
a burr hole in a specialist neurosurgical
centre. Patients can make a full recovery.

Figure 5.2 CT scan showing bilateral chronic
subdural haemorrhages.

KEY POINTS

• In a subdural haemorrhage, blood collects between the pia and dura mater.
• Subdural haemorrhages are more common in the elderly population due to cerebral
atrophy.

• Computed tomography demonstrates a concave haematoma unlimited by cranial sutures.

CASE 6:

RIGHT UPPER ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
A 45-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department complaining
of continuous right upper quadrant pain. This has been worsening over the last 12 hours.
Previously the patient has had intermittent pain in the same area lasting up to a few
hours after eating. She had tried some antacids with no benefit. There has been no vomiting. She complains of irregular bowel pattern, predominantly loose, smelly and rather
pallid stool for some months. There is no significant past history and she does not take
regular medication.
Examination
The woman appears well but in discomfort with normal observations. The cardiovascular
and respiratory examination is normal. The abdomen is soft but focally tender over the
right liver edge. The liver is not enlarged. There is no renal angle tenderness.
You arrange tests including an ultrasound of the abdomen (Figure 6.1).

Figure 6.1 Ultrasound views of the liver and gallbladder in longitudinal (a) and transverse
(b) planes.

Questions
• What differential diagnoses are you considering?
• What does the ultrasound show?
• Is ultrasound the best investigation to start with?

15

ANSWER 6
The stool appearance and Murphy’s point tenderness point to gallbladder inflammation
although the differential includes liver pathology, pancreatitis, gastric or duodenal ulcer,
renal obstruction or infection.
The ultrasound shows a partially filled gallbladder with a thickened irregular layered
oedematous wall (>3 mm). The gallbladder contains two small stones that reflect virtually all of the beam, giving a shadow appearance behind the stone. A stone is seen in the
gallbladder neck and part of the ultrasound examination is to roll the patient onto the
right side to see if the stones are mobile. In this case the stone is fixed at the gallbladder
neck. These are the appearances of acute obstructive cholecystitis.
For suspected gallbladder or biliary abnormalities, an ultrasound is a good starting investigation. Ultrasound has a very high sensitivity for gallstones whereas at least 20 per cent
of gallstones are not seen on computed tomography (CT). Biliary dilatation is also easily
seen on ultrasound, appearing as an extra tube running alongside the intrahepatic portal
veins (double-barrel sign) or as an extrahepatic dilated common bile duct. Sometimes the
cause of obstruction is seen, although the proximity of gas in the stomach, duodenum
and hepatic flexure of the colon can often obscure extrahepatic causes. An abdominal
radiograph is often included in the work up and is helpful to look for other causes such
as renal stones causing colic. Only 30 per cent of gallstones contain enough calcium to
be radio-opaque and visible on the abdominal radiograph.
The signs of cholecystitis are also seen frequently on CT that may be done if there is
uncertainty as to the diagnosis (Figure 6.2).
Cholecystitis results from obstruction of
the cystic duct and in about 90 per cent
of cases this is caused by a calculus. In
80 per cent these are cholesterol based,
20 per cent are pigment based. A few
cases are caused by sludge that is a fine
calcified sediment that forms if the bile
becomes very concentrated. The remainder
are acalculous cholecystitis, which has all
the inflammatory signs without stones and
tends to occur in systemic illness, biliary
stasis and local or systemic ischaemia.
Rarely, gas within the gallbladder or biliary tree is seen if there is added infection.
Figure 6.2 Axial contrast CT scan through
the gallbladder showing fluid around the
gallbladder.
KEY POINTS

• Ultrasound is a good test for gallbladder and biliary problems.
• Murphy’s sign – focal tenderness over the gallbladder – is frequently elicited by the
pressure of the ultrasound probe.

• Look on the ultrasound for gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening and oedema as signs
of cholecystitis and gas as a sign of infection.

CASE 7:

HEARTBURN, EPIGASTRIC PAIN AND A COUGH

History
A 67-year-old man presents to his general practitioner (GP) with a cough. The man was
well known to the doctor as he had been a regular attendee over the course of the previous 12 months with recurrent chest infections. His background included longstanding
symptoms of heartburn, dyspepsia and epigastric pain, for which he was prescribed a
regular proton pump inhibitor (with some relief). He took no other medications, however,
and lived at home with his wife.
Examination
No abnormalities were found on examination of the chest. His respiratory rate was 18
breaths per min with equal and good air entry bilaterally, vesicular breath sounds with
no added sounds. He was referred for a chest radiograph (Figure 7.1) but on the basis of
the radiograph the reporting radiologist suggested an upper gastrointestinal (GI) contrast
swallow examination (Figure 7.2). One day following the barium swallow examination
the patient presented acutely in the accident and emergency department with symptoms
of epigastric pain, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed (Figure 7.3).

Figure 7.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 7.2 Upper GI contrast swallow exam.

Questions
• What does the plain chest radiograph
demonstrate (Figure 7.1)?
• Why would the radiologist suggest a
barium swallow examination?
• What do the barium swallow spot
image (Figure 7.2) and axial enhanced
CT image (Figure 7.3) show?

Figure 7.3 CT scan.
17

ANSWER 7
Spot images taken from a barium swallow examination confirm the presence of a sliding
hiatus hernia (Figure 7.2). The axial enhanced CT image (Figure 7.3) again demonstrates
a large sliding hiatus hernia extending into the thorax. The chest radiograph shows a
gas-filled viscus behind the heart shadow consistent with a hiatus hernia. An upper GI
contrast examination would confirm the presence of a hiatus hernia and any associated
gastro-oesophageal reflux to account for the patient’s symptoms.
A hiatus hernia occurs when part of the stomach protrudes into the thoracic cavity
through the oesophageal hiatus of the diaphragm. Hiatus hernias are classified either
as sliding hernias (where the gastro-oesophageal junction moves above the diaphragm
together with part of the stomach) or para-oesophageal or ‘rolling’ hiatus hernias (where
part of the stomach herniates through the oesophageal hiatus and lies beside the oesophagus without movement of the gastro-oesophageal junction). Approximately 95 per cent of
hiatus hernias are sliding and the remaining 5 per cent are para-oesophageal.
Plain chest radiographs (as in Figure 7.1) may demonstrate a retro-cardiac mass with or
without an air–fluid level. When air is seen within the hernia, the stomach air bubble
found below the diaphragm tends to be absent. The hernia is usually positioned to the left
of the spine, however larger hernias (particularly when incarcerated) may extend beyond
the cardiac confines and even mimic cardiomegaly.
An upper GI barium series (as in Figure 7.2) is the preferred examination in the investigation of hiatus hernia and its sequelae. A single-contrast barium swallow performed with
the patient prone is more likely to demonstrate a sliding hiatal hernia than an upright
double-contrast examination. The hernia can usually be recognized by the demonstration
of mucosal gastric folds. CT scans are useful when more precise cross-sectional anatomic
localization is desired.
Most hiatus hernias are actually found incidentally, often being discovered on routine
chest radiographs or CT scans performed for unrelated symptoms. When symptomatic,
common symptoms include heartburn, dyspepsia or epigastric pain. On occasions, as in
this case, the patient may present with recurrent chest infections resulting from aspiration
of gastric contents. One sequel of hiatus hernia (particularly the sliding form) is the development of Barrett’s oesophagus, which may present with reflux symptoms or dysphagia.
With a para-oesophageal or rolling hernia, part of the stomach rolls into the thorax often
anterior to the esophagus and is frequently irreducible. Therefore this type of hernia is
more likely to present acutely because of a volvulus or strangulation. A para-oesophageal
hiatal hernia is diagnosed by the position of the gastro-oesophageal junction. The cardia
of the stomach and gastro-oesophageal junction usually remain in the normal position
below the diaphragmatic hiatus and only the stomach herniates into the thorax adjacent
to the normally placed gastro-oesophageal junction. This type of hernia, (unlike the sliding form) is not associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux.
KEY POINTS

• Hiatus hernias are frequently diagnosed incidentally on routine chest radiographs.
• The hernia may be seen as a retro-cardiac mass with or without an air–fluid level.
• An upper GI barium series or barium swallow study is the examination of choice
•

18

for demonstrating a hiatus hernia, gastro-oesophageal reflux and any associated
complications (e.g. Barrett’s oesophagus).
A para-oesophageal or, rarely, sliding hiatal hernia may present acutely because of
a volvulus or strangulation.

CASE 8:

LINES, CATHETERS AND TUBES ON A RADIOGRAPH

History
A 59-year-old woman has recently been admitted to the intensive care department. She
has chronic renal failure and relies on peritoneal dialysis every night. This morning,
while attending her clinic appointment, she complained of a sudden onset of headache
and collapsed to the ground, shaking violently. The emergency ‘crash’ team were called
immediately and found the patient unresponsive with generalized jerking movements.
The senior doctor decided that she should be paralysed, intubated and ventilated for protective measure, and she was then transferred to the intensive care department for further
management. The patient was satisfactorily stabilized, and a central line was placed in
her right internal jugular vein for the infusion of intravenous medication and to monitor
her central venous pressures. A chest radiograph has been performed to confirm correct
placement before its use (Figure 8.1), which you have been asked to report.

Figure 8.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What additional lines and tubes does this radiograph demonstrate?
• Are the lines and tubes correctly positioned?
• What other common medical equipment may be seen on a radiograph?

19

ANSWER 8
Any radiograph can be complicated by additional shadows from foreign lines or drains.
Their presence implies that the patient is unwell, and it is important to not only recognize
the type of line and common complications associated with its insertion, but its presence
on the film should not be a distraction to reporting pathological change (for example,
left lower lobe collapse in Figure 8.2). These types of films are often mobile examinations
from intensive care (ITU) patients and can be complicated by rotation, poor inspiratory
effort and an anterior–posterior (AP) projection. The commonest lines are discussed
below, with chest drains discussed in a separate case; see Case 27.

Figure 8.2 Chest radiograph with labels.

• Endotracheal (ET) tubes: A patient is intubated for reasons of mechanical ventilation
and airway protection usually because they are critically ill or undergoing anaesthesia. Correct placement is critical and an ET tube is recognized on a chest radiograph
as a linear opacity projected over the trachea in the midline. Insertion of an ET tube
is beyond the scope of this book, but once in the trachea a radiolucent balloon cuff is
inflated to maintain stability and a mechanical seal. The tubes are positioned blindly by
an airway expert and a chest radiograph is used to confirm its position. Ideally, the tip
of an ET tube should be located within the trachea, approximately 1–2 vertebral body
heights above the carina. This allows ventilation of both lungs and incorrect placement
should be highlighted urgently to the referring clinician. The commonest abnormality is
advancement of the ET tube into the right main bronchus preferentially ventilating the
right lung only. If not corrected, the patient may be compromised by left lung collapse.
An example of an ET tube in the right main bronchus is given in Figure 8.3.

20

Figure 8.3 Chest radiograph showing ET tube
in right main bronchus.

• Nasogastric (NG) tubes: These are placed in patients for numerous reasons, most commonly nutritional. Correlating the position of an NG tube does not necessarily require
a chest radiograph. Testing the pH of the aspirate can confirm placement within the
stomach, thereby avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure. If this is not possible, a
chest radiograph should demonstrate the NG tube as a midline linear opacity extending below the left hemidiaphragm. This confirms its presence in the stomach and not
in a main stem bronchus, avoiding the catastrophic infusion of nutritional support
into the lungs. The tip of an NG tube is not always seen on the chest radiograph, but
should lie within the stomach. It can sometimes migrate into the duodenum with gastric peristalsis and should be partially withdrawn.
• Central lines: Primarily placed in patients for the infusion of intravenous medication,
central lines can also avoid the need for peripheral cannulation and risks of thrombophlebitis. A chest radiograph is performed post insertion to confirm tip position and
exclude the most serious complication of pneumothorax. A central line is a radioopaque density projected paramedially over the internal jugular or subclavian vessels,
and can have a wide variety of appearances depending on the side it is inserted and
how many lumens the line contains (Figure 8.4). It may also be tunnelled under the
skin in the case of a Hickman line, with the possible addition of a buried metallic
port (portacath). Recognizing the type of line is important but not essential. Correct
tip positioning is critical for optimal infusion. The tip of a central line should ideally
lie at the confluence of the inferior and superior vena cava as blood drains into the
right atrium. This is identified on a chest radiograph at a point approximately one
vertebral body height below the carina. A short line position carries thrombotic risks,
while overenthusiastic advancement into the right atrium can encourage myocardial
excitation and atrial ectopics.
• Others: ET tubes are not suitable for patients requiring long-term ventilatory support
and often a tracheotomy is inserted just inferior to the cricoid cartilage. Lying in the
midline within the superior mediastinum, a tracheotomy tube appears as a radioopaque curvilinear density with a buttressed cuff at the skin surface. Its tip should lie
within the trachea above the carina.
Figure 8.4 also shows cardiac monitoring and pacing equipment. The two paddle-shaped
radio-densities are adhesive conducting pads, and are used to monitor a patient’s heart
rhythm, control the heart rate through electrical pacing and can be used to deliver an
electrical cardioversion shock if necessary. They are correctly positioned here along the
electrophysiological axis of the heart. Continuous cardiac monitoring is performed by

strategically placed metallic electrodes connected by wires to an external monitoring
box. The electrodes can have a variety of appearances and the wires are draped over the
patient, often lying erratically over the film. They are seen in Figure 8.4 overlying both
humeral heads, and in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
KEY POINTS

• The presence of lines indicates an unwell patient.
• It is important not to let lines on a radiograph be a visual distraction to the underlying
pathology.

• An ability to recognize all lines and the common complications associated with them
is necessary.

CASE 9:

WEAKNESS AND SLURRING WHILE OUT FOR A DRINK

History
A 67-year-old man is bought into the accident and emergency department by ambulance
with new left-sided limb weakness and a left facial droop. This started 40 minutes earlier
while the patient was having a pint in his local pub. Complaining of dizziness for a short
while, the patient suddenly fell from his bar stool. The concerned bar tender managed to
help him to an armchair and noticed that he was slurring his words and could not use his
left arm to help himself up. An ambulance was called, and during this time the patient
developed a left-sided facial droop. He remained alert throughout but appeared anxious
and disorientated.
The patient is known to the hospital, and has attended previously with attacks of angina.
There is no history of myocardial infarction, but he is on tablets for hypertension and
dyslipidaemia. He is a smoker and lives at home with his wife. There have been no recent
intercurrent illnesses.

Examination
A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed as part of his medical assessment
(Figure 9.1).

Figure 9.1 CT scan.

Questions
• What does the CT scan show?
• What is a stroke?
• What are the treatment options?

23

ANSWER 9
This (Figure 9.1) is a single image from an unenhanced CT scan acquired at the level of
the corona radiata. There is a background of generalized involutional change in keeping
with the patient’s age, and some hemispheric white matter low attenuation suggestive
of small vessel disease. Within the right fontal lobe there is a wedge-shaped area of low
attenuation with loss of the normal grey/white matter differentiation and extension to the
cortical surface. There is mass effect with the adjacent sulci effaced, but no evidence of
midline shift or hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of haemorrhage or mass lesion. The
image findings are consistent with an acute right middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction
on a background of generalized ischaemic change.
Any vascular interruption within the brain starves distal tissues of blood causing cell
death and neurological deficit. This is termed a ‘stroke’ and is usually thromboembolic
(90 per cent) in aetiology,1 and less commonly haemorrhagic. In the acute setting,
unenhanced cranial CT is used to differentiate between the two. Treatment pathways for
infarction require antiplatelet therapy, but haemorrhage needs to be excluded to avoid
the catastrophic effects of anticoagulation.
Figure 9.2 demonstrates an acute intracerebral haemorrhage within the left cerebral
hemisphere. Cranial CT has a high sensitivity (89 per cent) for haemorrhagic stroke.
Acute blood within the brain parenchyma appears white on CT (attenuation Hounsfield
unit (HU) of 60–70) and stands out against the adjacent darker brain tissue. Treatment
for haemorrhagic stroke is usually conservative and supportive.

Figure 9.2 CT scan showing acute
intracerebral haemorrhage.

In acute infarctive stroke, cranial CT is relatively insensitive (45 per cent at ictus rising
to 74 per cent by day 11)1 and radiological features can vary. A normal cranial CT does
not exclude thromboembolic stroke, and should neurological deficit fully resolve within
24 hours, this is termed a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The significance of patients
presenting with a TIA should not be underestimated, and these patients should be considered as an acute medical emergency requiring risk stratification to prevent further non24

fatal disabling stroke. In the setting of an acute infarctive stroke or TIA, the cranial CT
may be normal. Large thromboembolic strokes classically demonstrate a wedge-shaped
area of low density with blurring of the grey/white matter junction. In the image from the
CT scan taken from our patient (Figure 9.1), there is loss of grey/white matter differentiation within the right fronto-parietal region compared to the contralateral side. This area
is shaded grey in Figure 9.3, which shows the subtle features of an acute thomboembolic
stroke.

Figure 9.3 CT scan.

In larger infarctive strokes, associated vasogenic oedema can press upon adjacent brain
tissue and cause mass effect. The CT findings can usually localize the cerebral artery
involved, most commonly the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Figure 9.4 shows an unenhanced axial CT slice demonstrating a well-demarcated area of low attenuation, with
loss of the grey/white matter interface and mass effect, in keeping with a large acute left
MCA infarct.

Figure 9.4 Unenhanced axial CT slice.
25

Many hospitals are now offering thrombolysis therapy for acute thromboembolic stroke.
Any history of intracranial haemorrhage is an absolute contraindication, and performing and interpreting a cranial CT is therefore essential prior to treatment. Some other
contraindications are listed in Table 9.1 in the criteria taken from the National Institute
of Health and Clinical Evidence (NICE) guidance.2 Thrombolysis therapy has to be administered within 3 hours of symptom onset and speed of brain imaging is very important.
Without revascularization, neuronal demyelination causes atrophy of brain tissue with
time, and the patient is left with a permanent neurological deficit. In the case of our
67-year-old patient, he may qualify for stroke thrombolysis and a senior stroke physician
should initiate this quickly all criteria having been met.

CASE 10:

BACK PAIN RELIEVED ONLY BY ASPIRIN

History
A 23-year-old caucasian man presented to the accident and emergency department (A&E)
with back pain. Usually fit and healthy, he has suffered from achy throbbing back pain
for the last 6 months. Always in the same position in his lower back, it is there intermittently but has increased in frequency over the last 2 weeks. The pain is worse at night and
it often wakes him from sleep. He denies any trauma, weight loss or symptoms related to
his bladder or bowel movements.
His general practitioner diagnosed occupation-related back pain in relation to the
patient’s job as a farmer, and recommended rest while prescribing several combinations
of analgesia with little symptomatic relief. He does describe marked improvement in his
symptoms with aspirin, but the pain often returns after only an hour. Waking up tonight,
he was frustrated with the pain at home and attended A&E.

Examination
On examination he looks healthy but in mild discomfort. He has full range of movement with no evidence of bony tenderness on palpation. Cardiovascular, respiratory and
abdominal systems are normal. X-ray is shown in Figure 10.1.

Figure 10.1 Plain radiograph.

Questions
• What does the plain radiograph demonstrate?
• What is your differential for these findings?
• What further investigations need to be performed?
27

ANSWER 10
Figure 10.1 is a plain anterior–posterior (AP) radiograph of the lower thoracic and lumbar
spine in an adult male patient. The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal alignment in the
AP view with normal vertebral body height preserved throughout. There is an abnormality centred on the right L4 pedicle with expansion of the cortex and dense sclerosis. The
adjacent transverse process also appears expanded compared to the contralateral side but
there is no evidence of periosteal reaction. The psoas muscle shadow is preserved, making
psoas abscess unlikely and there is no evidence of a large soft tissue component. There
is no evidence of fracture but a mild scoliosis is demonstrated at this level concave to
the right.
The differential for these appearances in a young caucasian man includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

osteoid osteoma;
osteoblastoma;
healing fracture;
sclerosing osteomyelitis (e.g. tuberculosis, syphilis);
Brodie’s abscess;
osteoblastic metastasis;
lymphoma;
primary bone tumour (e.g. osteosarcoma).

Further radiological imaging is recommended and a choice needs to be made as to which
modality will provide the best diagnostic yield with minimal inconvenience and radiation dose to this young patient. Considering the likely osseous location of the lesion, a
computed tomography (CT) scan would have superior resolution compared to magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Bone scintigraphy would also be beneficial but not as the firstline imaging modality following a plain film radiograph.
Figure 10.2 is a single axial slice of an unenhanced CT scan acquired at the level of the
L4 vertebral body viewed with bone windows. Within the right pedicle there is a welldefined 17 mm lesion (arrow) that has a narrow zone of transition and is predominantly
lytic in nature with some central calcification. There is diffuse sclerosis and expansion
of the adjacent lamina and transverse process, with no evidence of periosteal reaction,
spinal canal encroachment or pathological fracture. No soft tissue component is demonstrated. These features are in keeping with an osteoid osteoma, however considering its
size (>15 mm) it is more appropriately described as an osteoblastoma.

Osteoid osteoma

Figure 10.2 Unenhanced CT scan.
28

Osteoblastomas are rare benign tumours of the bone composed of multinucleated osteoclasts with irregular trabeculated bone and osteoid, surrounded by highly vascular fibrous
connective tissue.1 The commonest sites of involvement are around the knee joint in the
long bones and within the posterior elements of the spine. They have unlimited potential
for growth and carry a risk of malignant degeneration, therefore requiring definitive
curative treatment at diagnosis.
The main treatment options include surgical removal, endovascular embolization, percutaneous CT-guided removal or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. In this case,
endovascular treatment was attempted (Figure 10.3).

Figure 10.3 Angiographic image at embolization.

This angiographic image obtained at embolization (Figure 10.3) demonstrates a blush of
contrast overlying the pedicle of the L4 vertebrae on selective cannulation of the right
L4 lumbar artery. The arterial supply to this osteoblastoma was embolized with polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) and two microcoils. Follow-up 2 months later revealed an asymptomatic
patient, and successful treatment was confirmed on CT with complete sclerosis at the site
of the previous osteoblastoma (Figure 10.4).

Figure 10.4 CT scan post embolization.
29

KEY POINTS

• When deciding on an imaging modality, consider which investigation will offer the
best diagnostic yield with minimal patient inconvenience and radiation dose.

• Osteoblastomas are rare benign vascular tumours of the bone.
• Subclassified according to size, an osteoid osteoma larger than 15 mm is termed
osteoblastoma.

CASE 11:

A PERSISTENT COUGH IN AN EX-SMOKER

History
You are asked to review a 67-year-old man in the chest clinic. He has been sent by his
general practitioner (GP) who has been treating him for a cough. His symptoms started
3 weeks ago, at about the same time that the patient decided to stop smoking. The cough
is chesty but non-productive, and is there constantly, but not worse, at night. He has no
other new symptoms and is no more short of breath than usual, with an exercise tolerance of approximately 200 m. His appetite is unchanged and he has not lost weight. He
does report occasional streaks of fresh red blood in the sputum on deep coughing.
The patient has a past medical history of excessive alcohol intake and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had two previous admissions to hospital with decompensated liver disease, but has now abstained from alcohol for over a year. His last
ultrasound scan confirms a degree of liver cirrhosis. He has smoked with a 60 pack-year
history. He has never been admitted to intensive care with exacerbations of COPD, but
has been treated for pneumonia in the past. He recently decided to stop smoking as his
new girlfriend does not like to ‘kiss an ashtray’.

Examination
As part of his management, the GP performed a chest radiograph (Figure 11.1) and then
referred him to the chest clinic.

Figure 11.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does this chest radiograph demonstrate?
• What further radiological investigations are required?
• What is PET scanning?
31

ANSWER 11
This is a diagnostically adequate posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph of an adult male
patient. There is a 2.3 cm rounded mass lesion within the left mid zone adjacent to the left
hilum that appears to cavitate in its inferior aspect. No other pulmonary parenchymal nodularity is seen. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally which may represent
either small pleural effusions or be longstanding related to pleural thickening. There is a
background of emphysematous change as evidenced by lung hyperinflation and flattening
of the hemidiaphragms. Bilateral gynaecomastia is also noted. The rounded lesion may represent a malignancy in the form of a lung primary in view of the clinical history, however
a focus of infection or metastasis cannot be excluded. Correlation with old films is advised.
The suspicious nature of this pulmonary mass lesion warrants a computed tomography
(CT) scan, which ideally should be performed with intravenous contrast. Although the
chest X-ray only demonstrates a solitary lesion, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen is
recommended. This allows characterization of both the lungs and mediastinum, and also
assesses the solid abdominal viscera (e.g. liver and adrenals), which are sites of common
involvement in disseminated lung cancer. Extending the CT to involve the abdomen
allows for accurate staging of primary lung cancer, and the patient can be referred to the
lung multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) for further discussion.
The CT scan confirms a background of centrilobular emphysema and a left lower lobe
pulmonary nodule measuring 2.6 × 1.6 cm (Figure 11.2). This tethers the oblique fissure
and demonstrates an adjacent airspace opacification with cavitation. No disease was seen
in the contralateral lung, mediastinum or below the diaphragm. Findings are compatible
with a primary bronchial malignancy.

Figure 11.2 Sagittal CT scan.
32

The patient was then referred to the MDM. Time is an important factor to limit the spread
of disease, and efficient transfer of patient care through the relevant specialities is of
utmost importance to expedite definitive treatment.
A tissue diagnosis is important to obtain histological characterization of the lesion.
Although cavitation and a history of smoking infers a likely squamous cell aetiology,
histological confirmation is essential to tailor further chemotherapy or surgical treatment.
The location of this lung primary would necessitate a CT-guided biopsy under the auspices of the interventional radiologists. A coaxial needle system is passed under CT guidance and local anaesthetic cover into the lesion, and a core biopsy sample taken (Figure
11.3). Patients should be consented for the risk of lung contusion and pneumothorax.

Figure 11.3 Biopsy under CT guidance.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan is indicated in potentially operable tumours
to assess nodal status and occult metastatic disease. This is required for complete disease
staging and will dictate further treatment. If the PET scan confirms that this lesion is solitary and there is no evidence of nodal or metastatic spread, then the patient may be eligible
for definitive surgery in the form of lobectomy if medically fit, although careful assessment will be needed in view of his significant COPD. Should the PET scan suggest inoperable or disseminated disease, then a chemotherapeutic treatment may be more appropriate.
A PET scan is a nuclear medicine scan, usually performed in combination with a CT scan.
PET uses a radioactive isotope with a short half-life (e.g. fluorine-18 (F18)), which is biochemically incorporated into the functionally active glucose molecule fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG). It is used extensively in oncology imaging because the FDG–F18 is concentrated
in metabolically active tissues, radiolabelling those tissues with high amounts of glucose
uptake. Although there is physiological uptake in organs such as the brain, heart and
liver, primary cancers and their metastases can also be detected by the PET scanner, as the
F18 undergoes positron emission decay. The images obtained are fused with unenhanced,
attenuation corrected CT images taken concurrently for anatomical correlation.
33

Although not its primary function, CT can also allow further detection and assessment of
both related and unrelated pathology. As well as primary staging, PET scanning can be
used to assess response to treatment. Despite being an effective tool, its major limitations
are related to cost (both of the scanner and in generating the isotope) and lesion size:
small metastases (<1 cm) may not accumulate detectable levels of FDG–F18.

KEY POINTS

• A patient with a chest radiograph suspicious for lung cancer should be referred for a
chest CT scan to characterize the lesion further.

• Lung biopsy can be performed under CT guidance for histological characterization.
• A PET scan is often used to assess suitability when planning the treatment for a patient
with lung cancer.

CASE 12:

A SCHOOLMASTER WITH PROGRESSIVE

BREATHLESSNESS
History
A 64-year-old man is referred to the respiratory outpatient clinic for assessment. He
gives a history of a shortness of breath which has been insidious in onset over the last
4 years. Over the last year, this has been associated with a dry cough which he cannot
seem to clear despite several courses of antibiotics. He feels fatigued and had found it
more difficult to complete a round of golf, which he used to do twice a week. His weight
has remained steady and he denies orthopnoea. There is no relevant past medical history.
He is a non-smoker and admits to social drinking only. He takes 75 mg aspirin daily
on advice of his general practitioner (GP) but is not on any other regular medication.
Occupationally, he is nearing retirement as a school headmaster and denies any history
of occupational dust exposure. He lives at home with his wife and keeps no pets.
Examination
On examination, he is well perfused and not cyanosed, but has evidence of nail clubbing
bilaterally. Lung expansion is reduced and auscultation demonstrates fine inspiratory
crackles, more marked at the bases.
Prearranged lung function studies demonstrate a restrictive lung defect and a chest radiograph was taken for assessment (Figure 12.1).

Figure 12.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• How would you describe the chest radiograph appearances?
• What would be the differential for these appearances?
• How is the idiopathic cause of this condition subclassified?

35

ANSWER 12
This is a posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph of an adult male patient. There is good
alignment, inspiration and penetration. The heart and hila are of normal size with an illdefined ‘shaggy’ heart boarder. The lungs demonstrate volume loss, most marked at the
bases with depression of the horizontal fissure on the right. There is reticular shadowing
to the lung parenchyma in a subpleural distribution with relative sparing of the apices.
There is no evidence of calcified lymph nodes or air–fluid levels within the oesophagus.
Correlation with old radiographs is recommended, but the appearances are suggestive of
pulmonary fibrosis.
Many people have difficulty with the descriptive terms of ‘reticular’ and ‘nodular’ shadowing. They are commonly used in chest radiograph reporting, implying clear differentials and distinction between infective and interstitial causes of lung disease. Reticulation
describes lines that branch and interlace as a result of thickened interstitial septa between
secondary pulmonary lobules. Nodularity, however, describes well-defined ‘dots’, which
can vary in size and are predominantly caused by airspace opacification and imply an
infective focus. Just to confuse matters, some conditions (e.g. sarcoidosis) can be both
reticular and nodular in appearance.
In this scenario, the reticular pattern implies an underlying diagnosis of interstitial lung
disease, with volume loss suggesting a fibrotic component. The causes of these appearances are numerous, and it is important to scrutinize the distribution of disease to help
narrow the differential. The causes of lung fibrosis, divided between an apical and basal
distribution, are listed in Table 12.1.
Table 12.1 Causes of lung fibrosis
Upper zone fibrosis

Lower zone fibrosis

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
Radiation
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis
Ankylosing spondylitis
Sarcoidosis
Silicosis
Tuberculosis
Histocytosis X

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
Drugs (e.g. amiodarone)
Rheumatoid disease
Scleroderma
Asbestosis
Dermatomyosytis

By history alone and in the absence of ancillary features associated with connective tissue
disease, a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is made in this patient. To confirm
and subclassify the diagnosis, the patient should be referred for a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest scan. This is different from a normal ‘volume’ computed
tomography (CT) scan of the chest and is an unenhanced study, providing high-resolution
thin (1 mm) cuts of the lung parenchyma at 1 cm intervals (Figure 12.2).
This single image of the patient’s HRCT obtained within the lower zones of the chest
demonstrates areas of disruption to the normal lung parenchyma with thickening of the
interlobular septa causing a ‘honeycomb’ like appearance. These changes are predominantly confined to a subpleural distribution with preservation of the normal lung parenchyma centrally. This is characteristic of usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), a subtype
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There is clinical importance in determining the likely
36

subtype, as UIP is relatively insensitive to steroid therapy with a 45 per cent 5-year mortality.1 The other broad subtypes are:
• Non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP): Despite an often normal chest radiograph, appearances on HRCT are of patchy ground glass opacification with no clear
zonal distribution. There is no evidence of honeycomb fibrosis and this subtype is
more likely to respond to steroid therapy with an overall 5-year mortality of 11 per
cent.1
• Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP): Seen predominantly in patients who
smoke, appearances on chest radiograph and HRCT are of both subpleural ground
glass opacification and honeycomb fibrosis. This is confined to the lower zones but is
not associated with significant volume loss. DIP has a variable steroid response with
a 50 per cent 5-year survival.1

Figure 12.2 High resolution chest CT scan.

KEY POINTS

• Reticular shadowing with parenchymal volume loss is the characteristic feature of
pulmonary fibrosis on chest radiograph.

• It is important to scrutinise the distribution of disease within the lungs to help make the
causative diagnosis.

• HRCT is integral in characterizing the type and extent of pulmonary fibrosis.

CASE 13:

NUMB RIGHT ARM

History
A 50-year-old man presents with a history of an intermittently numb right arm that has
become more of a problem recently after some heavy lifting. There is no history of trauma
or surgery and there is no clear history of onset although the problem has been present
for some months. He notices it most after sleeping, with forearm and hand numbness
that wears off with movement. He also has an intermittent dull ache and impression of
reduced strength, for example when trying to open jars. There is no history of Raynaud’s
phenomenon, swelling or cold hand. There is no other significant medical history.
Examination
The arms are symmetrical. There are normal peripheral pulses. There is a subjective
mild weakness on the right to flexion at the elbow with a slightly reduced biceps reflex.
Reflexes and sensation are otherwise normal. No pulse changes are noted in hyperabduction or on deep inspiration with the head turned to the right side (Adson’s manoeuvre).
In the right supraclavicular fossa a small hard lesion is palpable. The chest and abdomen
are normal.
You arrange a chest radiograph (Figure 13.1a,b).

(a)

(b)

Figure 13.1 (a) Chest and (b) anterior–posterior (AP) cervical spine radiographs.

Questions
• What differential diagnoses are you considering?
• What does the radiograph show?
• What imaging or investigation would you do next?
39

ANSWER 13
The differential diagnosis for this presentation is quite broad and can be narrowed down
in broad classes. The symptoms are predominantly neurological and primary neurological
causes such as spinal stenosis, tumour, cerebral infarct or multiple sclerosis or secondary causes including thoracic outlet syndrome affecting the brachial plexus, ulnar nerve
compression and carpal tunnel syndrome should be considered. The possible weakness
of elbow flexion and biceps reflex suggests a C5/C6 level lesion. There is less evidence
for a vascular cause such as Raynaud’s disease, vasculitis or vascular compression. Other
causes include trauma and soft tissue lesions such as a Pancoast tumour.
The radiograph shows bilateral cervical ribs. The mediastinum and lungs appear normal.
The right cervical rib has a pseudoarthrosis (false joint) in the mid portion that corresponds with the hard palpable lesion in the supraclavicular fossa.
Although a vascular cause seems unlikely, an angiogram – selective imaging of vessels – may be helpful to check for compression of the subclavian vessels. Arteries or
veins can be selectively studied by injection of contrast either by direct catheterization in
combination with fluoroscopy, or intravenous injection and selective timing of the computed tomography (CT) scan. A catheter angiogram rather than a CT angiogram allows
the patient to be put in different positions to try to induce the intermittent symptoms. The
angiogram in Figure 13.2a proved to be normal. Given the predominantly neurological
symptoms, further imaging should concentrate on identifying the position of the underlying lesion best done with magnetic resonance (MR) to examine soft tissue and nerve roots
at the cervical spine and brachial plexus (Figure 13.2b). MR is less sensitive for cortical
bone and a cervical spine radiograph for comparison is also helpful.
The patient’s symptoms are caused by the disc prolapse (demonstrated on MR) rather than
thoracic outlet syndrome due to the cervical ribs.

the right subclavian artery. (b) T2-weighted sagittal MR image showing degenerative changes at
C5/6 with disc protrusion into the canal (arrow) also resulting in nerve root compression.
KEY POINTS

• Thoracic outlet syndrome can be subdivided into neurological, arterial and venous
causes. The symptoms may help decide the most likely cause.

• Cervical ribs are a fairly common finding and often asymptomatic.

CASE 14:

JAUNDICE FOLLOWING CHOLECYSTECTOMY

History
A 41-year-old woman attended hospital for an ultrasound appointment requested by her
general practitioner (GP). She had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 months
previously and had recovered well, but over the last 3 weeks she had been complaining
of increasing pain in the right upper quadrant and occasional itching. She denied any
weight loss or jaundice, and reported normal appearances to her stool and urine. She is
a non-drinker with no other notable medical history.
Examination
On examination she had slightly icteric sclera. She was comfortable at rest but had
scratch marks on her upper arms from recent itching. The cardiovascular and respiratory
examinations were normal, and her
abdomen was soft with slight tenderness of the right upper quadrant
on deep palpation. There was no
organomegaly.
Investigations showed a normal full
blood count and renal function, but
liver function showed an elevated
bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase
with normal transaminases and
albumin levels. Her amylase was
normal.
She was referred for an abdominal
ultrasound to assess her liver parenchyma (Figures 14.1 and 14.2).

Figure 14.1 Abdominal ultrasound.

Figure 14.2

Questions
• What does the ultrasound demonstrate?
• What procedure is performed in Figure 14.2?
• What is interventional radiology?
41

ANSWER 14
Figure 14.1 is a single ultrasound image of the left lobe of the liver obtained with a
curvilinear transducer (C5–2) in a longitudinal orientation. The liver appears of normal
echogenicity and echo texture with a smooth capsular contour. No focal lesion is seen on
this image. There are anechoic linear structures seen which extend to the periphery with
a maximal diameter of 4 mm, and colour Doppler assessment in Figure 14.2 demonstrates
no flow within them. This is in keeping with intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, and the
remainder of the study did not demonstrate an obstructing lesion although the common
bile duct (CBD) was 7 mm in diameter, which is within normal limits for a patient post
cholecystectomy. The patient was referred for a liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan for further characterization. The liver function tests of raised bilirubin and alkaline
phosphatase with normal transaminases and albumin suggest obstruction with normal
cellular and synthetic function.
Figure 14.3 is a coronal maximal intensity projection (MIP) image of the same patient
acquired from heavily T2-weighted sequences. It confirms moderate intrahepatic biliary
duct dilatation and also demonstrates a focal tapered stenosis at the level of the common
hepatic duct. There is no intraductal filling defect or stenosing soft tissue mass lesion, and
the CBD and pancreatic duct are of normal calibre. The appearances suggest a stricture
of the common hepatic duct which may be ischaemic, post inflammatory or neoplastic in
nature. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was advised to obtain
cytology brushings, attempt to correct the obstruction and decompress the intrahepatic
ducts, but a stent could not be inserted. The patient was therefore referred to the interventional radiology department for a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC).
The single image of the PTC (Figure 14.4) was acquired by opacifying the intrahepatic
ducts with radiographic contrast during a fluoroscopy procedure. The dilated ducts of
the left system were punctured under ultrasound guidance, and a guidewire was then
manipulated across the hilar stricture and down into the duodenum. A sheath (8F) was
inserted to stabilize the position, and contrast was injected through this to perform the
cholangiogram. A stent can be passed over the wire and placed across the stenosis to
relieve the obstruction and improve patient symptoms. This procedure is performed by
the interventional radiology department.
Interventional radiology (IR) is an expanding subspeciality of radiology that uses imaging
guidance and minimally invasive techniques to diagnose and treat a patient. A trained
radiologist uses their experience in ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy to guide the passage of a needle or catheter to a site of interest and perform a task
that would otherwise be surgically difficult and involve significant morbidity in the form
of an open operation. Interventional radiology consultants can use the veins, arteries and
biliary ducts to access deep or distal lesions, vessels or organs, often leaving only a pinhole size scar at the site of puncture (often the groin) as a sign of recent treatment. This
allows tissue conservation, reduced morbidity and faster recovery for patients. The scope
of the speciality is too broad to be effectively covered in this answer, but the procedures
used include the following:
• Angiography: A vein or artery can be punctured with ultrasound guidance, and contrast is injected mapping the vessel anatomy under fluoroscopy. Stenoses and occlusions can be characterized and an expandable balloon is used to improve blood flow.
This is termed ‘angioplasty’.

42

Figure 14.3 Coronal maximal intensity
projection image.

Figure 14.4 Percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiogram.

• Biopsy: Ultrasound (superficial lesions) and CT (complicated or deep lesions) can help
to guide a needle accurately to a lesion of interest for core biopsy and histological
characterization.
• Drainage: Inserting a drain can offer a conduit for decompression of infected collections or uncomfortable ascites. Optimal and accurate placement is obtained by imaging guidance.
• Stenting: Expandable stents can be inserted into a vessel or duct to act as ‘scaffolding’
and can exert radial force to maintain patency in atherosclerosis or tumour stenosis.
• Line insertion: Patients on long-term therapy (e.g. dialysis, antibiotics, chemotherapy)
require definitive vascular access (e.g. Hickman line, portacath) to avoid the discomfort of recurrent peripheral cannulation and thrombophlebitis.
• Embolization: Instilling an embolic agent (coils, particles or glue) into a selectively
cannulated vessel can control active haemorrhage, prevent aneurismal rupture or
infarct a tumour (e.g. uterine fibroid). An adjunct to this is chemoembolization, where
a chemotherapy agent is instilled directly to a tumour and then the blood vessel is
embolized to cause tumour infarction.

43

• Radiofrequency ablation: Small malignant lesions can be cauterized via a specialized
electrical probe that is inserted under image guidance for accurate placement.
• Vertebroplasty: Guiding the infusion of inert cement into a collapsed spinal vertebra
can provide stability in cases of osteoporotic or metastatic collapse.

KEY POINTS

• Ultrasound is excellent for the assessment of the liver and has a high sensitivity for
detecting intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.

• Biliary obstruction can be circumvented by stent insertion either via ERCP or PTC.
• Interventional radiology is a subspeciality of radiology that uses image guidance to
perform minimally invasive techniques.

CASE 15:

INFANT WITH CLICKING HIPS

History
A 6-week-old female infant is brought by her mother as part of the 6-week check in general practice. The baby was delivered at term by caesarian section due to a breech presentation. Her maternal grandmother and aunt are known to have chronic hip problems.
Examination
On examination she moves both lower limbs normally. The hip creases appear a little
asymmetric. On Barlow’s manoeuvre (adduction of the hip with light pressure on the
knee) the right hip appears to pop posteriorly and then anteriorly on Ortolani’s manoeuvre (the hips and knees are flexed to 90 degrees and anterior pressure is applied to
the greater trochanters while using the thumbs to abduct the legs).
You expedite the hip ultrasound that has already been arranged due to the risk factors
(Figure 15.1).

(b)

Figure 15.1 Left and right hip ultrasound images (coronal flexion view).

Questions
• Who gets hip ultrasound?
• What do the images in Figure 15.1 show?
• Is a radiograph helpful?
• What happens next?

45

ANSWER 15
Hip ultrasound is done on neonates and young infants (<6 months) to screen or check for
developmental dysplasia of the hip. Screening is done on infants with risk factors that
include family history, breech presentation, foot deformities or neuromuscular disorders.
Examination features that raise suspicion for hip abnormality include asymmetric groin
creases, a click on movement and a click or subluxation on provocation tests.
As with all ultrasound, gel is used to couple the ultrasound beam into the soft tissue and
allow movement of the probe without loss of image. The baby is placed in the lateral
position with the hip flexed and the probe is placed parallel to the ilium (bright line on
the left of the image) and the orientation optimized to produce a horizontal image like a
golf ball (stippled cartilage of the femoral head) on a tee (cup is the acetebulum, stalk is
the ilium). If the golf ball appears to be falling off the tee (upwards on the image), then
the femoral head is subluxed and the acetabular cup is shallow. This is all formalized by
measuring angles (indicated on the image). The alpha angle measures the acetabular roof
angle with the ilium and normally measures over 60 degrees. The beta angle assesses the
prominence of the labrum (cartilaginous flange around the acetabulum).
Figure 15.1 shows a normal left hip but a low alpha angle (53.5 degrees) on the right,
corresponding with a shallow acetabulum and hip instability. The ultrasound shows a lot
of soft tissue detail, including the unossified cartilage as well as the bone, although the
anterior bone edge blocks the beam and no deeper structure is seen. Plain radiographs
complement this view by demonstrating the bone structure but with very poor soft tissue
detail. Ultrasound is the investigation of choice in infants with unossified femoral heads
but as the ossification centre develops and blocks the ultrasound from about 6 months
onwards, radiographs are more useful. Figure 15.2 shows the hip radiograph at 4 months.
The aim is to diagnose a hip abnormality as soon as possible to minimize the degree of
intervention required to fix the problem. Treatment ranges from observing (if very mild
and picked up on a neonatal scan) to braces or surgical intervention.

Figure 15.2 Radiograph at 4 months
with right hip subluxation and a
shallow right acetabulum (relative
to Hilgenreiner’s line drawn on the
radiograph).
KEY POINTS

• Ultrasound is the method of choice for examining infant hips.
• Hip screening in infants with family history or breech presentation occurs at 4–6 weeks.
46

CASE 16:

PAINFUL WRIST AFTER FALLING

History
A 13-year-old girl presents to the accident and emergency department with a painful right
wrist after falling while roller skating. She fell backwards with her arm outstretched. Her
wrist appears deformed, but she tells you that although it hurts, the wrist has had that
appearance for a long time and that it was investigated at another hospital many years ago.
She gives a family history of bone problems but is otherwise well with no medical problems.
Examination
On the volar aspect of the right forearm just proximal to the wrist there is a firm swelling
that extends laterally. There is some associated tenderness but no malalignment of the
wrist or hand. There is normal movement, pulses and sensation. The chest and abdomen
are normal. Given the history you also briefly examine the arms and spine that appear
normal and the legs. The bone around the knees is prominent, with an asymptomatic
bony nodule over the lateral aspect of the proximal right tibia.
You arrange radiographs of the arm (Figure 16.1a,b).

(a)

(b)

Figure 16.1 Anterior–posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs.

Questions
• What do the radiographs show?
• Can you name some differential diagnoses?
• What other imaging should be obtained?
47

ANSWER 16
The radiographs show a lobulated expansile lesion arising from the cortical bone of the
radial metaphysis and extending proximally. The bone is well delineated with a narrow
zone of transition, an appearance suggesting the lesion is benign. No fracture is seen.
The appearance is in keeping with an exostosis, also known as an osteochondroma, that
results from dysplasia of the growth plate. This may be solitary or multiple in a condition
known as multiple hereditary exostosis (or diaphyseal aclasis), or rarely as part of various
syndromes such as Turner’s syndrome or tuberous sclerosis.
Rather than take more images of the arm, the best course of action would be to obtain
previous images. Picture archiving and communication system (PACS) is the digital system
developed to manage the images primarily produced in hospital radiology departments. In the last decade it has almost
entirely replaced film-based archives with
the advantages of rapid search and comparison, remote and web-based access and
integration into other hospital information
systems. In this patient, a previous skeletal
image on PACS (Figure 16.2) suggests the
diagnosis of multiple hereditary exostosis.
Multiple hereditary exostosis is inherited
as an autosomal dominant trait, with an
incidence of about 1 in 50000. Children are
diagnosed on average around 3 years old.
As seen in this case, bony growths (exostoses) arise from the metaphyses, point
away from epiphysis, and extend down
the diaphysis during growth. They increase
in size and number with age, arising in
several characteristic sites. Over 90 per
cent of cases are at the distal and proximal tibia, proximal femur and proximal
humerus. Ribs, scapula, radius, ulna, ilium
and phalanges are also common sites.

Figure 16.2 AP radiograph of both legs
showing large right proximal and distal lateral
tibial exostoses and bilateral proximal medial
tibial exostoses (see arrows).

Clinical complications include trauma and
fractures, particularly at exposed positions
at the wrist and knees. The exostosis may exert pressure on surrounding soft tissue and
cause neurovascular compromise. There can be inequality in limb length or short stature.
In a small proportion of patients (1–2 per cent) at a later age (>21) an exostosis undergoes
sarcomatous transformation into a chondrosarcoma. This is more likely in exostoses of
the pelvis, scapula, proximal humerus, proximal femur and spine, and may be associated
with a change in size or onset of pain.
KEY POINTS

• Exostoses can be solitary or multiple and develop from the metaphysis while the
growth plate is open.

• Exostoses can cause symptoms. In older symptomatic patients, malignant
transformation should be considered although it is uncommon.

CASE 17:

CONSTIPATION IN WOMAN WITH OVARIAN TUMOUR

History
A 78-year-old woman presents to the oncology clinic with a 1 week history of right
upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness and constipation for 3 days. She has a history
of metastatic ovarian cancer treated with abdominal hysterectomy, oophorectomy and
omentectomy for peritoneal disease 15 months ago. She has also had chemotherapy. On
her last scan she was noted to have lung nodules, mediastinal and mesenteric lymph node
enlargement that appeared stable and a new caecal metastatic deposit.
Examination
On examination, she is not acutely unwell. Her observations are normal. The chest and
heart sound normal. The upper abdomen is tender and there is a palpable fullness or mass
below the right costophrenic margin.
You assess an abdominal radiograph (Figure 17.1) during clinic and decide to admit the
patient for assessment and a computed tomography (CT) scan.

Figure 17.1 Abdominal radiograph.

Questions
• What is the likely cause of her pain?
• What does the radiograph show?
• What appearance do bowel contents have?

49

ANSWER 17
Based on the history of cancer and surgery, the patient is at risk of bowel obstruction
secondary to adhesions associated with surgery or tumour infiltration. Metastatic ovarian
carcinoma frequently metastasizes through the peritoneal space, seeding deposits onto
the omentum (removed in this patient’s case) and mesentery. Liver metastases are also
possible, causing pain from stretching the liver capsule, biliary obstruction or ascites.
Other common causes that are less likely in this case are cholecystitis and appendicitis.
The radiograph shows a large volume of faeces in the pelvis within large bowel or rectum
and gas-filled empty bowel loops on the left side of the abdomen. There is a paucity of
bowel gas on the right together with impression of a large soft tissue region extending
throughout the right side of the abdomen. Small bowel can be distinguished from large
by its central position and a fold pattern likened to a coiled spring (valvulae conniventes)
less than 3 cm in normal diameter. Large bowel tends to frame the abdomen with haustral folds that are widely spaced and not circumferential (i.e. they do not cross the whole
diameter of the visible bowel).
The patient’s CT (Figure 17.2) shows a large right upper quadrant mass, probably a metastatic deposit, displacing empty transverse colon to the left and partially obstructing the
caecum that is distended by faeces. Gallstones are also seen; these are not apparent on
the plain radiograph.

Gallstone

Mass

Caecum

Figure 17.2 Reconstructed coronal CT slice of the
abdomen and pelvis.

The colon receives the sterile dilute
product of digestion and then proceeds to remove a large proportion of the fluid content as well
as employing microbial digestion
(fermentation) to extract various
products not produced in small
bowel digestion, such as vitamin K.
As a result, faeces take on a more
solid appearance as they move
round the colon. In addition, the
microbial activity produces gas and
the stool has a characteristic foamy
appearance. Stomach contents also
have a similar appearance with
food mixed with fluid and air.
Small bowel tends to be predominantly homogeneously fluid filled
in appearance although with a
small amount of gas that increases
if there is obstruction.

KEY POINTS

• The distribution of stool tends to be of more significance than its appearance.
• Constipation may be indicated by a large volume of stool throughout the bowel,
•
50

a rather solid appearance to the stool in the rectum or impacted faeces above an
obstruction.
Radiographs are rarely indicated for constipation unless obstruction is suspected.

CASE 18:

THIRTY-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH HEADACHE

History
A 30-year-old man presents to you with a chronic history of headache that has worsened
significantly in the last week. Investigations for the same problem 9 months ago ruled
out sinus disease. He is concerned that this may be due to a brain tumour. Several relatives have died of various types of cancer. There is no history of definite head trauma,
although he has had various sporting injuries. There is no other history of significant
illness. On careful questioning the headache is reported to be present on waking and
worsens on coughing.
Examination
On examination he is well. His observations are normal. There is papilloedema on examination of the eyes but no focal neurology is demonstrated. Examination is otherwise
normal.
You arrange a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head.

(a)

(b)

Figure 18.1 Axial CT image of the brain at the level of (a) the third ventricle and (b) the fourth
ventricle.

Questions
• Headache is a common problem. What red flag symptoms help to decide on investigations?
• What does the CT show?
• What would you do next?

51

ANSWER 18
Headache is a common problem, often assessed in general practice and often associated
with tumours by patients. The annual incidence of brain tumours is about 10 per 100 000
per year whereas up to 4000 per 100000 GP consultations are for headache, so some
discrimination has to be used to avoid imaging every patient.
If you see papilloedema then red flags are not required, urgent investigation is mandatory, after checking your records for previous investigation – very occasionally it is idiopathic and chronic. More commonly, fundoscopy is not performed well enough to see
changes. Other red flags include:
• systemic symptoms (e.g. neck stiffness) or secondary risk factors (e.g. cancer, HIV,
thrombosis);
• neurological symptoms or signs;
• onset (e.g. thunderclap headache);
• new progressive or unilateral headache in older patients (consider temporal arteritis);
• previous headache history changing pattern;
• triggered headache (e.g. cough, sneeze, straining).
The CT shows a large midline mass in the region of the pineal gland extending into
the subtentorial region, displacing the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres inferiorly and
compressing the aqueduct and fourth ventricle. There is dilatation of the lateral and third
ventricles but undilated fourth ventricle and basal cisterns in keeping with obstructive
hydrocephalus.
The next step is to characterize the midline lesion using magnetic resonance (MR) (Figure
18.2). This confirms hydrocephalus caused by a pineal fossa or tectal plate mass with
evidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the periventricular tissue, suggesting the obstruction is acute. The lesion may be a pineoblastoma.

contrast.
52

Hydrocephalus appears on scans as dilated CSF spaces and can be caused by obstruction,
as in this case. Communicating hydrocephalus occurs in the absence of obstruction due
to overproduction of CSF (e.g. tumour), defective absorption of CSF (most common, e.g.
after haemorrhage) or venous drainage insufficiency. Normal pressure hydrocephalus
occurs in older patients characterized by dilatation but no elevation of CSF pressure at
lumbar puncture and may be caused by intermittent intracranial hypertension.
This patient requires referral to a neurosurgical centre as the hydrocephalus requires acute
treatment with a shunt, as well as treatment planning for the underlying tumour.

KEY POINTS

• Headache is a common symptom and is only rarely caused by a brain tumour.
• Hydrocephalus can be acute or chronic, communicating or obstructive.
• CT is the initial investigation for acute neurological problems to check for
haemorrhage, hydrocephalus and presence of mass lesions.

CASE 19:

PERSISTENT COUGH

History
A 65-year-old woman with a persistent cough comes to see you in general practice. She
says that the cough has been present for months but that it has got worse in the last
week with associated coryzal symptoms. There is no history of haemoptysis, chest pain
or weight loss. She does not have asthma and is on medication for high blood pressure
and high cholesterol. She has a 30 pack-year smoking history, although she gave up
2 years ago.
Examination
There is no abnormality on examination of the respiratory system. Temperature and pulse
are normal; her blood pressure is 136/82. There is no significant neck lymphadenopathy
or tonsillar enlargement.
You consider the diagnosis of an acute upper respiratory tract infection with a background persistent cough. The cough has not been investigated before and you explain to
the patient that you will arrange a chest X-ray (Figure 19.1) but that antibiotics do not
seem appropriate currently.

Figure 19.1 Posterior–anterior chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the radiograph show?
• What are the most likely diagnoses?
• What is the next step?

55

ANSWER 19
The radiograph shows a single spiculated mass in the right mid zone. No significant hilar
or mediastinal widening is seen.
The differential diagnosis for a single pulmonary mass includes primary or secondary
carcinoma, hamartoma (especially if fat and calcification can be identified), pneumonia
or arteriovenous malformation. The patient’s age, smoking history and chronic cough are
red flags for considering carcinoma.
The next step is rapid referral of the patient to chest clinic with a preceding staging computed tomography (CT) scan. Most hospitals have a streamlined process for the radiology
department to flag up the patient to the relevant specialist clinic if cancer is suspected,
in anticipation of an urgent general practitioner (GP) referral.
The diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma and stage of disease was confirmed by
biopsy and positron emission tomography (PET) scan that confirmed T2a (<5 cm) N0 M0
(no affected lymph nodes or metastases) staging. The tumour was removed with the right
upper lobe (lobectomy).
The post-lobectomy radiograph (Figure 19.2a) shows signs of loss of right lung volume
with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and hilum but no significant right rib space
narrowing.

(a)

(b)

Figure 19.2 (a) Post- and (b) pre-operative chest radiographs with the lesion marked with an
arrow.

GPs have access to many imaging modalities at their local hospital, although plain
radiographs and ultrasound are the most used. They receive copies of the image reports,
typically within a week, but are not able to view the images. The Royal College of
Radiologists has produced referral guidelines.1
Chronic cough is a common GP presentation. The British Thoracic Society has produced
guidelines on how to manage chronic cough,2 a chest radiograph being one of the first
steps. Subsequent imaging depends on the diagnosis and whether imaging is likely to be
helpful in management.
56

KEY POINTS

• Pulmonary lobectomy results in loss of volume with possible elevation of the
•

hemidiaphragm and hilum, rib crowding or little or no volume change with
hyperexpansion of the residual lobes with associated increased translucency.
GPs have access to imaging modalities but typically do not have access to the images
and therefore it is important that the request states the clinical context and question
and the report provides an answer.

CASE 20:

CHEST PAIN AND DYSPNOEA

History
This 66-year-old woman was referred to the accident and emergency department by her
general practitioner (GP) with a 2 week history of dyspnoea, cough and fever that has
been worsening and an unclear history of new onset pleuritic chest pain. There is also a
history of a chronic pressure sore, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure treated with
appropriate medication. The GP had treated her for a few days with antibiotics initially
with little effect.
Examination
Her temperature is 39.3°C, pulse 104/minute, oxygen saturation 89 per cent breathing air
and there appears to be a right ventricular heave. There are coarse lung sounds in the
right upper zone posteriorly. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. The left hip is painful
but demonstrates normal range of movement and weight bearing. There is a mild degree
of peripheral sensory neuropathy but the legs are otherwise normal.
You arrange tests including a chest radiograph (Figure 20.1).

Figure 20.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the chest radiograph show?
• What are possible causes of the abnormality?

59

ANSWER 20
There is one and possibly a second circular cavitating lesion in the right upper zone that
contains an air–fluid level and has a thin wall superiorly. There is bilateral apical thickening. The hila appear normal and the heart is not enlarged. A displaced old fracture of
the left clavicle is noted.
There are multiple causes of cavities in the lung and features that help decide on likely
differential diagnoses include the clinical context, number of lesions, wall thickness,
appearance of contents (if any), position and presence of enlarged lymph nodes.
In terms of categories, cavities may form due to:
• infection, such as Staphylococcus (frequently multiple), Klebsiella, tuberculosis (frequently associated with fibrosis) and aspiration (these cavities are usually thick walled
and may contain fluid levels);
• neoplasm, such as bronchogenic carcinoma (particularly squamous cell carcinoma,
SCC), metastases such as SCC, colon and sarcoma, Hodgkin’s disease (with lymphadenopathy), often with thick walls;
• vascular infarction that may cavitate or become infected and cavitate;
• trauma, either the result of a haematoma or formation of a traumatic lung cyst;
• abnormal lung – infected emphysematous bulla;
• cavitating nodular vasculitic disease such as Wegener’s granulomatosis, rheumatoid
arthritis and occasionally granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, which all frequently have multiple cavities.
Given the patient’s tachycardia, ventricular heave and hypoxia it is also important to
consider cardiac causes and possible pulmonary embolism. A computed tomography (CT)
pulmonary angiogram was arranged (Figure 20.2a,b).

(a)

(b)

Figure 20.2 CT pulmonary angiogram showing a right lower lobe fluid-filled cavity (a) and, on
the slice just inferior (b), a pulmonary embolus in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery (white
arrow).
60

The most likely differential diagnoses are cavitation and infection secondary to an
embolus or a cavitating lung malignancy with secondary pulmonary embolus. The short
history and fever suggest infection and the subsequent course showed that the former
diagnosis was correct.

KEY POINTS

• Position, number of lesions, wall thickness and contents may be helpful in determining
the cause of lung cavities.

• Cavities are potential sites for secondary infection.

CASE 21:

YOUNG MAN WITH NECK SWELLING

History
This 17-year-old man presents to his GP with a swelling at the base of his neck that he
noticed recently after swimming. He also complains of tiredness, some loss of appetite
and night sweats developing over the last 4–6 weeks. There is no other medical history.
He has not travelled outside Europe and is not aware of recent exposure to any infectious disease.
Examination
On examination he has normal weight and does not appear unwell. He has normal observations. There is a palpable mass in the left supraclavicular fossa and prominent nodes
in the neck and axillae. The chest is clear. The abdomen is soft and not tender. You take
blood tests and arrange for a chest radiograph (Figure 21.1).

Figure 21.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What abnormalities are seen on the chest radiograph?
• What differential diagnosis would you consider?
• What other investigations would you consider for diagnosis?

63

ANSWER 21
The chest radiograph shows marked enlargement of the hila and mediastinum with multiple rounded masses. Multiple soft tissue masses are also noted in both lungs. The heart
and bones appear normal.
The differential diagnosis to be considered is that of bilateral hilar and mediastinal
enlargement with multiple lung masses. The hilar masses are lymph nodes and massively
enlarged. The mediastinal masses are likely to be in the anterior or middle mediastinum as
the thoracic spine and aortic outlines are clearly seen. At 17, the patient is young enough
to consider congenital causes but the recent symptoms and the widespread appearance
are suggestive of an acquired disorder. The differential could include neoplastic causes
such as lymphoma, leukaemia, germ cell tumour, metastases from sarcoma or possibly a
Wilms’ tumour, inflammatory lymphadenopathy from tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis or, less likely, a congenital cause such as lymphatic malformation. The most likely
diagnosis is Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) imaging is required (Figure 21.2), also below
the diaphragm to assess and stage the extent of disease. A tissue sample is also required
and this can be obtained by percutaneous biopsy of an enlarged superficial lymph node
(e.g. in the neck) or by endobronchial ultrasound-guided aspiration from a hilar lymph
node. Washings can also be taken to rule out tuberculosis.

(a)

(b)

Figure 21.2 Coronal computed tomography (CT) slices through (a) the thorax with arrows
showing mediastinal, hilar and pulmonary lymphadenopathy; (b) the abdomen showing
enlarged pancreatosplenic lymph nodes and a low attenuation lesion in the spleen.

Some nodes have lower attenuation centrally, suggesting necrosis. These finding are significant for the staging and treatment planning. Hodgkin’s lymphoma responds well to
chemo- and radiotherapy with good long-term survival, and the long-term side effects of
treatment must be considered when planning treatment regimes.
64

The radiology department may be involved in placing an indwelling catheter for regular
chemotherapy. Imaging is also required to assess response, typically CT. Subsequently,
imaging is used to assess for recurrence and complications.

KEY POINTS

• On a chest X-ray, mediastinal lymphadenopathy may increase the angle of the carina
•

or give the upper mediastinum a bumpy outline. Increased hilar bulk that does not
appear to be vascular may be lymphadenopathy.
Massive lymphadenopathy is suspicious for lymphoma.

CASE 22:

COLLAPSE AND POSSIBLE SEIZURE

History
A 75-year-old woman is brought into the accident and emergency department following
a collapse at home. She has no recollection of the event and appears very confused. Her
husband found her on the floor and is worried that she may have hit her head on some
furniture. The husband gives a history of his wife being ‘under the weather’ and ‘not quite
herself’ for several months, although he is unable to explain more specifically. She has
otherwise been fit and well and takes medication for blood pressure and for osteoporosis
prophylaxis.
Examination
On examination, routine observations are normal. Her Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is 15
and Mini Mental Test score 6/10. She has mild left-sided limb weakness that appears to
be resolving. The chest, cardiovascular and abdominal examination is normal.
You arrange tests including an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan of the head
(Figure 22.1), as called for by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE) guidelines on head injury criteria, including the patient’s age and amnesia.

Figure 22.1 Axial non-contrast CT scan through the
brain at the level of the quadrigeminal cistern.

Questions
• What does the CT show?
• What would you do next?

67

ANSWER 22
The CT shows a large lobulated mass with homogeneously increased attenuation in the
right parasagittal frontal lobe. There is mass effect with effacement of the frontal horn
of the right lateral ventricle and 1 cm shift of the midline to the left. There is minimal
surrounding vasogenic oedema. There is no intracranial haemorrhage or infarct. The basal
cisterns are patent.
When considering an intracranial mass, the first step is to decide if the mass arises within
the brain (intra-axial), ventricles or cisterns, or from the adjacent structures (extra-axial)
such as the meninges or the bone. More imaging using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) (or contrast CT if this is not possible) is also done, as this is more sensitive
to possible other lesions as well as giving more information about the tumour structure
and the surrounding brain (Figure 22.2).

(a)
(b)
Figure 22.2 Gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the brain showing a
uniformly enhancing lobulated mass in the right frontal lobe.

The MR shows that the tumour grows from a broad segment of the meninges and appears
to be growing along the falx at its edge (see arrow, Figure 22.2b), a so-called dural tail,
that is quite characteristic for a meningioma or metastasis (particularly breast). The
absence of other lesions and no history of a tumour elsewhere makes a metastasis less
likely although it is important to look. Meningiomas frequently have associated calcification and adjacent bone change. The differential also includes intra-axial tumours and
lymphoma, although appearance and position make this less likely.
Meningiomas occur intracranially and within the spinal canal arising from the arachnoid
layer. They are common, second only to glioblastoma in frequency. The parasagittal
position is the most common (33–50 per cent), although other common sites are near the
vertex or by the lesser wing of sphenoid or petrous ridge. Ninety per cent are benign but
because they grow slowly they can eventually have a space-occupying effect, become
68

symptomatic and as a result tend to be discovered later in life. Surprisingly, the symptoms
can seem disproportionately mild for such large tumours. This probably reflects the slow
onset and adaptation but also the nature of the prefrontal lobe symptoms, which include
change in mentation, apathy or disinhibited behaviour and urinary incontinence that are
sometimes attributed to ageing.
KEY POINTS

• Meningiomas are common, usually benign, relatively silent intracranial tumours.
• The onset and associated symptoms are often insidious and mild until there is a
significant mass effect.

CASE 23:

PREMATURE NEONATE WITH ABDOMINAL DISTENSION

History
A 6-day-old premature baby born at 31 weeks’ gestation on the neonatal unit is noted
to be lethargic and increasingly intolerant of feeds, with decrease in oxygen saturation
and abdominal distension.
Examination
Serial abdominal radiographs are obtained (Figure 23.1 and 23.2).

Figure 23.1 Initial radiograph.

Figure 23.2 Subsequent radiograph.

Questions
• Multiple tubes and lines can be seen in Figure 23.1. What are the two tubes seen in
the centre of the radiograph?
• What radiological signs are seen in Figure 23.2?
• What is your differential and most likely diagnosis?

71

ANSWER 23
Figure 23.1 shows the abdomen. Two tubes passing over the umbilicus are umbilical
artery and vein catheters. They can be distinguished by their course, the umbilical artery
catheter passes inferiorly to join the internal iliac artery before passing superiorly. The
tip should lie between T6 and T9 vertebral level to avoid major branches. The umbilical venous catheter passes superiorly to the left portal vein, passing through the ductus
venosus into the inferior vena cava (IVC). The tip should lie within the upper IVC or at
the border with the right atrium. In Figure 23.2, the tip of a nasogastric (NG) tube is
seen overlying the stomach. Aspiration and radiographs are typically used to check the
position.
The appearances on the first image (Figure 23.1) are non-specific but gas-filled small and
large bowel in a symptomatic premature infant should ring alarm bells.
The second image (Figure 23.2) shows dilatation of the bowel (greater than the width of
the L1 vertebral body). Bowel wall gas lucencies (pneumatosis intestinalis), particularly
in the right lower quadrant and portal venous gas (lucency over the liver) is seen. No
evidence of perforation is seen to warrant immediate surgical intervention.
Subsequent images (Figure 23.3) showed further distension and free gas outside the
bowel.

(a)

(b)

Figure 23.3 (a) Anterior–posterior (AP) and (b) lateral abdominal views with the patient supine
showing free gas (arrows) above the liver and around the bowel loops, indicating perforation.

The main differential diagnosis is necrotizing enterocolitis and other forms of sepsis.
Other differentials include Hirschprung’s disease (aganglionic distal colon/rectum), bowel
obstruction (such as small bowel atresia, meconium ileus, meconium plug) and ischaemia,
particularly in congenital cardiac disease.
Initial management is usually conservative including antibiotics and repeated imaging.
Surgery may be required for perforation or failure of medical management.
72

Necrotizing enterocolitis has a complex aetiology. Immaturity of the gut mucosa and
immune response, coupled with ischaemia/hypoxia, are felt to contribute with premature
and low birth weight babies at highest risk. Other risk factors more apparent in term
infants include sepsis, cyanotic congenital heart disease, polycythaemia and gastroschisis.
Long-term complications include strictures and short bowel syndrome.

KEY POINTS

• A low threshold for suspecting necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants is advisable.
• Radiograph findings may be non-specific, although comparing successive images may
indicate persistent bowel dilatation, thickening or pneumatosis.

• Management ranges from conservative to surgery if perforation is evident.

CASE 24:

YOUNG CHILD WITH PAINFUL ARM

History
This 1-year-old girl has been in the paediatric department for a few weeks for treatment
of streptococcal sepsis after chickenpox. Around the time of admission the child had
swelling over the left upper arm but no abnormality was seen on plain radiograph and
there was no collection on ultrasound. After treatment on the paediatric intensive care
ward she improved but then started to get intermittent fevers and worsening of the left
upper arm swelling.
Examination
The child is irritable and off her feeds. There is tachycardia and pyrexia. Cardiovascular
and respiratory examinations are normal. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. Her left
arm is not moving, red and swollen over the upper aspect. She complains when you
handle or move the arm.
You arrange a plain radiograph and compare it with the previous image (Figure 24.1a,b).

(a)

(b)

Figure 24.1 (a) Initial radiograph of left elbow. (b) Radiograph taken 14 days later.

Questions
• Describe the changes seen.
• What other imaging would you arrange?

75

ANSWER 24
The first radiograph (Figure 24.1a) is essentially normal (there may be some soft tissue
swelling). The second radiograph (14 days later) (Figure 24.1b) shows thick periosteal
reaction along the shaft of the humerus. Patchy lucency is seen within the distal humerus.
The appearance is consistent with an aggressive process. Given the acute onset and
sepsis, this is likely to be acute osteomyelitis that is an inflammation of bone caused by
an infecting organism. The differential for periosteal reaction in an infant could include
infiltrative tumour such as leukaemia or neuroblastoma, (non-accidental) trauma, prostaglandin therapy or vitamin deficiency such as rickets (not uncommon) and scurvy (rare).
Osteomyelitis has a bimodal distribution. In children it typically occurs by haematogenous spread with insidious onset. Typical bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus, group A
Streptococcus (in this case), Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacter species. Patients
with sickle cell disease are particularly at risk of S. aureus and Salmonella species. The
bacteria pass into the metaphysis of the most rapidly growing tubular bones via nutrient vessels where they lodge and cause inflammation, vascular congestion and increased
pressure. There may also be some thrombosis. This is followed by a suppurative phase
where pus forms subperiosteal abscesses. Increased pressure and thrombosis compromises
the blood supply causing bone necrosis and sequestrum formation (fragments of necrotic
bone) over a period of days. A layer of new bone, or an involucrum, forms around the
raised periosteum. With treatment there is a resolution phase with remodelling of bone.
A skin sinus can form in the absence of treatment or as a complication. Other complications in children arise due to damage of the growth plate with deformity or shortening of
the developing bone. Haematologically spread osteomyelitis in adults is typically centred
in a vertebra.
Direct osteomyelitis is associated with traumatic inoculation, more focal and more typical in adults, particularly those who are at increased risk due to peripheral neuropathy
and immune compromise such as diabetic patients. Typical bacteria are S. aureus,
Enterobacter species and Pseudomonas species. The development is much the same as
described but more focal.
Other imaging that is helpful is a three-phase bone scan that images the whole skeleton
and identifies further sites of disease. A magnetic resonance (MR) scan is useful to confirm the diagnosis and examine the soft tissues and bone marrow for abscess formation
and complications.
Figure 24.2a,b shows subsequent plain radiographs of the sequestrum phase and
resolution.

resorption, necrosis and reformation.

ACUTE EPIGASTRIC PAIN

History
This 57-year-old woman presented to the accident and emergency department with sudden onset of epigastric pain with vomiting and retching. There is a background history
of grumbling epigastric discomfort with loss of appetite and weight but no bowel disturbance. There is no other medical history of note.
Examination
She looks unwell with mild pyrexia and dehydration. The pulse is 96/minute and regular,
blood pressure is 122/80 lying and 104/72 standing. The chest examination is otherwise
normal. Abdominal examination shows mild distension with no significant scars but it is
rigid to palpitation, dull to percussion and very reduced bowel sounds are heard.
Abdominal and erect chest radiographs are obtained (Figure 25.1).

(a)

(b)

Figure 25.1 (a) Abdominal and (b) chest radiographs.

Questions
• What abnormality is present on the X-ray?
• What is your differential diagnosis?
• What further imaging would you like to do?

79

ANSWER 25
This is a case of acute abdomen. The first priority is to resuscitate and stabilize the patient
and as the patient is middle aged and relatively fit, she may be compensating quite well.
The abdominal X-ray shows undilated small and large bowel. No classic signs of free gas
outside the bowel wall (Rigler’s sign), triangular gas pockets or gas outlining the falciform
ligament are seen on the abdominal radiograph.
A chest X-ray is part of the investigation of acute abdomen and is obtained after about
5 minutes with the patient sitting as upright as possible. This allows any free intraabdominal gas to rise, giving the characteristic free gas under the diaphragm sign. This
chest radiograph shows free gas below the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum). Appearances
may be deceptive and gas within an organ may look like a perforation. The right upper
quadrant is a good place to look as the liver normally abuts the diaphragm and any
gas will be obvious. Occasionally the bowel will occupy this space, a condition called
Chiladiti’s syndrome. Look for characteristic bowel wall folds.
Differential diagnosis for free gas under the diaphragm includes:
• iatrogenic causes – normal appearance after a surgical or laparoscopic procedure or
perforation from a surgical anastomosis or after endoscopy;
• perforation due to gastroinstestinal tract disease – gastric/duodenal ulcer, appendix
or diverticular perforation, obstruction (e.g. neoplasm) or specific paediatric disorders
and inflammatory bowel disease;
• conditions that mimic free gas – pseudopneumoperitoneum, such as distended bowel
loops, Chiladiti’s syndrome, diaphragmatic hernia, oeosphageal diverticulum and subphrenic abscess.
A contrast computed tomography (CT) is typically done provided the patient is stable, as
the additional anatomical information may help locate the source of perforation (Figure
25.2).

Free gas

Figure 25.2 Sagittal reconstruction CT slice of the abdomen, showing free gas anterior to the
stomach suggesting a perforated gastric ulcer and possible gastric mass. This is useful for the
surgeon to know as tissue diagnosis is required and surgical planning may change.
80

Free gas can be seen after abdominal surgery although a significant quantity of gas
3 days after surgery is suspicious. If available, compare with any previous post-surgical
images. CO2 insufflation used in laparoscopy absorbs rapidly and probably should be
gone after 24 hours.

KEY POINTS

• Plain images of the patient can be done without moving the patient, although to allow
•

free gas to appear under the diaphragm, the patient has to be upright before the chest
X-ray.
There are many causes of pneumoperitoneum and a combination of history and CT
may determine the likely cause.

CASE 26:

MAN WITH ATYPICAL CHEST PAIN

History
A 50-year-old man presented with sudden onset moderate central chest pain. He smokes
15 cigarettes a day and drinks around 10 pints of beer over each weekend. He has had
no previous illnesses.
Examination
On examination he looks well. His blood pressure is 164/90 but observations are otherwise normal. Nothing abnormal is found on examination of respiratory, cardiovascular,
abdominal and nervous systems. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal.
A posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph is requested as part of the work up for possible
acute coronary syndrome (Figure 26.1).

Figure 26.1 PA chest radiograph.

Questions
• What abnormality is present and where is it?
• List some possible differential diagnoses.

83

ANSWER 26
The radiograph shows an abnormal but well-defined right heart border. This may reflect
cardiac enlargement or a separate soft tissue mass. In general, the position of a soft tissue
mass may be indicated by the loss of definition of the edge of adjacent structures – the
silhouette sign. In this case the right heart border is abnormal, suggesting a mass adjacent
to the right atrium of the heart obscuring the normal air–tissue interface. The differential diagnosis therefore includes anterior and middle mediastinal or lung masses such as
pericardial cyst, lipoma, fat pad, bronchogenic cyst, sequestration, massive lymphadenopathy, diaphragmatic hernia, ventricular aneurysm or right atrial enlargement.
A computed tomography (CT) scan is the next step in imaging (Figure 26.2). This not
only localizes the abnormality but also displays the soft tissue attenuation (measured
in Hounsfield units, HU), which allows distinction between fat (e.g. in a fat pad or
lipoma – typically negative HU), water-like fluid (HU <10) in a cyst, soft tissue and
contrast (>100 HU) in, for example, a ventricular aneurysm. In this case there is a fluid
attenuation mass adjacent to the heart, which otherwise appears normal, consistent with
a pericardial cyst. There is also a small area of adjacent right upper lung lobe collapse
(atelectasis).
Pericardial cysts are congenital malformations that are attached to the parietal pericardium, but do not communicate with the pericardial space. If there is communication with
the pericardial space, the structure is termed a pericardial diverticulum. They are usually found incidentally in asymptomatic
patients. The most frequent location is in
the right cardiophrenic angle, but they can
be found in the left cardiophrenic angle,
anterior mediastinum or middle mediastinum. The vast majority are unilocular
and they usually range in size between
3 and 8 cm. Because they are soft, they
may change shape with position. Rarely,
they may cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures and require
surgical removal.
Bronchogenic cysts arise out of the tracheobronchial tree as a congenital malformation, typically pericarinal but also paratracheal, oesophageal, retrocardiac and
pulmonary in location. They are usually
asymptomatic but may cause stridor, compression or become infected.

Figure 26.2 Reconstructed coronal CT slice
through the thorax.

KEY POINTS

• Pericardial cysts are occasionally incidental, asymptomatic findings on chest X-ray.
• They abut the heart, resulting in a silhouette sign, and may be diagnosed on CT if they
have classic cystic appearance.

84

CASE 27:

YOUNG WOMAN WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH

AND CHEST PAIN
History
This 37-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department after referral from her general practitioner (GP) complaining of increasing breathlessness and
intermittent right-sided chest pain. The symptoms have come on over 2–3 weeks without
associated fever or significant cough. There is a medical history of pelvic pain that is
undergoing investigation for suspected endometriosis. She is otherwise well, a nonsmoker and taking no medication.
Examination
The right hemithorax is dull to percussion with reduced breath sounds throughout. The
left lung and heart sound normal. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation diffusely over both iliac fossae.
You arrange some tests including a chest radiograph (Figure 27.1).

Figure 27.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What is the main abnormality and what effect is it having on the normal anatomy?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the appropriate management?

85

ANSWER 27
There is uniform opacification of most of the right hemithorax. The right hemidiaphragm
and heart border are not seen. There is displacement of the heart and trachea to the left.
Some residual aerated right lung is noted, probably the apices of the right upper and lower
lobes. The left lung and heart are normal in appearance. No bone abnormality is seen.
We are looking for causes of opacification of a hemithorax. This can be within the lung,
mediastinum or pleural space and may involve consolidation, soft tissue or fluid. The position of the mediastinum gives a clue as it is displaced away from the opacity even though
the lung only appears partially aerated. This suggests a differential of pleural fluid or soft
tissue, such as from a diaphragmatic hernia. Other causes such as consolidation, lung collapse, tumours (such as mesothelioma) or congenital agenesis or hypoplasia tend either not
to displace or to displace the mediastinum
towards the opacity. The appearance with
smooth edges and some thickening of the
horizontal fissure suggests pleural effusion.
Effusions can be transudates (protein
<30 g/L; e.g. in cardiac failure), exudates
(>30 g/L; e.g. in infection, malignancy,
pulmonary infarction), haemorrhagic (e.g.
trauma, carcinoma) or chylous (e.g. due
to obstructed thoracic duct caused by
trauma, malignancy or parasites). Systemic
diseases often cause bilateral effusions but
can be unilateral.
To investigate this further, cross-sectional
imaging to determine the underlying cause
may be done. Computed tomography (CT)
is not typically sensitive to the type of
effusion. The effusion may also be drained,
particularly if the patient is symptomatic,
and a sample of fluid may help to decide
on the cause. This is typically done with
ultrasound guidance (Figure 27.2a), often
using a Seldinger technique with a needle
to insert a guidewire over which a drain
tube is inserted. Thoracoscopy may be performed to look into the pleural space and
allows biopsy of any abnormal pleural tissue. Figure 27.2b shows the result of drainage. The effusion in this case was stained
with old blood and eventually shown to be
caused by an endometriosis deposit.

(a)

(b)
Figure 27.2 (a) Ultrasound of the right lung
base; (b) anterior–posterior (AP) radiograph
showing a right basal chest drain and partial
drainage of the effusion.

KEY POINTS

• There are multiple causes of thoracic opacification and noting the effect on the
mediastinum and anatomy helps to narrow down the possible causes.

CASE 28:

CHEST DISCOMFORT AND DYSPNOEA

History
A 68-year-old man on treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma presents to the accident
and emergency department with mild chest discomfort, worse on lying flat and eased by
leaning forward. It has been getting slowly worse over the last few weeks. Now he gets
dizzy on standing, rapidly breathless on exertion and has noticed some bilateral ankle
swelling over the last week. He does not have a significant past cardiac or respiratory
history.
Examination
On examination his blood pressure is 144/88, pulse 94/minute and respiratory rate
22/minute. The JVP is a little raised and fine crackles are heard at both lung bases. The
heart sounds are difficult to hear but otherwise regular. The abdomen is soft and there
is moderate left flank tenderness to deep palpation. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows
small QRS complexes and T wave inversion.
You organize a chest radiograph as well as blood tests (Figure 28.1).

Figure 28.1 Posterior–anterior (PA) chest
radiograph.

Questions
• What abnormalities are seen?
• What others symptoms or signs might you find?
• What other tests would you do?

87

ANSWER 28
The heart is enlarged. The hilar vessels are not enlarged. There is some blunting of the
costophrenic angles but no lung abnormality is seen.
The heart size is usually estimated by measuring the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR, maximum cardiac width/maximum inner thoracic width) on a PA projection radiograph with
adequate inspiration (6 ribs seen anteriorly, 10 posteriorly). Beware anterior–posterior
(AP) projections and poor inspiration as this will artificially increase the size of the heart.
Typically in adults a CTR ratio >0.5 suggests cardiomegaly.
In addition to the CTR, the heart shape may indicate an underlying cause such as valve
disease or a shunt. Increase of the right atrium size shifts the right heart border laterally;
the left ventricle shifts the left heart border. The right ventricle lifts the heart, moving the
apex superolaterally. The left atrium is behind the heart and on enlarging may project a
second border over the right side of the heart. The left atrial appendage may enlarge and
may produce a bump at the upper left heart border. Often the heart just appears generally
enlarged and correlates with heart failure; occasionally this may be due to a pericardial
effusion and is termed the ‘water bottle sign’.
The differential diagnosis for cardiomegaly includes ischaemic heart disease, valve disease, pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade, dilated cardiomyopathy and pulmonary
embolism. In this patient, the presentation is suspicious for a pericardial effusion, probably malignant in origin and is confirmed on computed tomography (CT) (Figure 28.2).

(c)

Figure 28.2 (a) The presenting radiograph, (b) the coronal CT shows a rim of lower attenuation
fluid around the heart, (c) radiograph after paracentesis.

The pericardium covers the heart and great vessels, with the exception of only partially
covering the left atrium and normally contains less than 50mL of transudate fluid. To
be distinctive on chest X-ray more than 250mL needs to be present. The type of excess
fluid depends on the cause:
• transudate – congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminaemia;
• exudate – infection, autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, hypersensitivity);
• blood – trauma, surgery, rupture, myocardial infarction, neoplasm;
• lymph – neoplasm, surgery.
An echocardiogram is the next investigation of choice and may be used to guide insertion of a pericardial drain.
88

KEY POINTS

• A cardiothoracic ratio greater than 0.5 on a PA projection radiograph with good
inspiration indicates cardiomegaly.

• Pericardial effusions are difficult to see on chest X-ray unless large, although a rapid
change in heart size on successive X-rays is suspicious.

CASE 29:

SKATEBOARDER WITH A PAINFUL FOOT

History
A 13-year-old boy was skateboarding when he fell forwards onto steps and twisted his
right foot. His description of the injury sounds as if it involved inversion of the foot. He
is taking no medication and there is no significant medical history.
Examination
The boy is a fit 13 year old who appears well but in discomfort. The right mid foot is
swollen and tender, more over the lateral aspect. The ankle joint is not painful but there
is pain in the foot on moving the ankle joint. There are no other injuries.
You arrange plain radiographs of the right foot (Figure 29.1).
Figure 29.1 Anterior–posterior radiograph of
the right foot.

Figure 29.2 Magnified oblique
radiograph of the right foot.

Questions
• Given the history, where would you look for an injury?
• What do the radiographs show?
• What might be confusing about the appearance of this injury?
• What other foot fractures should you consider?
91

ANSWER 29
Given the history of inversion, a common injury, the lateral side of the foot, particularly
the base of the fifth metatarsal should be checked. Forced dorsiflexion suggests the shafts
of the metatarsal and phalanges could also be injured.
The radiographs show a complex lucency through the base of the right fifth metatarsal,
in keeping with a fracture (Figure 29.2). There is associated soft tissue swelling. No other
fractures are seen.
The appearance of the fracture is complex. Reviewing the whole foot, multiple epiphyses are noted consistent with a 13 year old with active growth plates which may cause
some confusion in interpretation of the radiographs. An unfused apophysis (secondary
ossification centre) lies parallel to the lateral edge of the base of the fifth metatarsal. The
transverse fracture line crosses the apophysis and base of the metatarsal. Fractures at the
base of the fifth metatarsal are common and reflect an avulsion injury of the peroneus
brevis tendon, typically on inverting the foot. The fracture edge is typically at right
angles to the metatarsal lateral cortex and should not be confused with the apophysis, if
present. There may also be an ossicle close the fifth metatarsal base. Ossicles should have
a smooth outline with a regular or corticated edge.
Other common foot injuries to be considered that can be subtle in appearance are:
• Lisfranc fractures (see Case 87), in which the Lisfranc ligament at the base of the first
to fourth metatarsals is injured; there may be avulsion fragments between the first and
second metatarsal bases and the alignment of the metatarsal shafts and cuneiforms is
lost;
• avulsions, appearing as small flakes of bone around the interphalangeal joints where
the flexor, extensor tendons insert;
• stress fractures of the shafts of predominantly second and third metatarsals in long
distance runners or people with a walking injury; these may be difficult to see and
appear initially only as a periosteal reaction;
• fracture through the first metatarsal ossicles.

KEY POINTS

• The mechanism of injury and site of symptoms may help to find subtle injuries.
• It is important to look around the edge of every bone, as small avulsions and stress
fracture periosteal reactions are easy to miss.

• Review the whole foot and beware of ‘satisfaction of search’ – where you stop looking
after finding an injury. Multiple injuries are common in trauma.

92

CASE 30:

LEFT-SIDED LOIN PAIN

History
A 24-year-old man presents with sudden onset left upper quadrant pain radiating to the
groin with mild haematuria. He has no history of previous episodes or past renal problems. There is no history of lower urinary tract symptoms. He is otherwise fit and well
with no medical problems or relevant family history. He smokes 10 cigarettes per day and
drinks around 10 units of alcohol per week.
Examination
He is well with a pulse of 94 per minute but otherwise normal observations. The chest
examination is normal with normal heart sounds. The abdomen is soft but tender on the
left side, most notably over the left renal angle and left inguinal fossa. Urinalysis shows
blood 4+ but no protein or nitrites.
You arrange an urgent intravenous urogram (IVU) (Figure 30.1).

(a)

(b)

Figure 30.1 (a) Control and (b) 20-minute images from an intravenous urogram. Pelvic views
were normal.

Questions
• What is a urogram?
• What are you looking for on the control image and do you see any abnormality?
• What does the 20-minute image show?
• What is the differential diagnosis?

93

ANSWER 30
An IVU consists of a control image without contrast to look for calcification. Contrast is
then given intravenously and images are taken while the contrast passes through the kidneys (nephrogram phase) and then as it drains through the collecting system and ureters
into the bladder. The IVU is becoming a rather old-fashioned test because it provides only
limited anatomical information and is being replaced by pre, post and delayed contrast
phase computed tomography (CT).
The control image (Figure 30.2a) is reviewed for calculi (none seen) and the renal outline,
which in this case appears enlarged and lobulated bilaterally (Figure 30.2b).

(b)
Figure 30.2 (a) Control and (b) corresponding coronal CT slice demonstrating the renal outline
and appearance.

The 20-minute IVU radiograph shows drainage of contrast through the collecting system
on the right that has a slightly distorted appearance. No drainage is seen on the left,
suggesting obstruction, confirmed on later images with a delayed nephrogram and slow
accumulation of contrast in a dilated collecting system and due to a small stone, not seen
on the plain images, at about the level of the pelviureteric junction (outflow of the left
kidney) seen on CT.
There is an underlying bilateral kidney disorder with lobulated increase in size due to
cyst formation. The differential for cystic diseases of the kidney includes acquired simple
cysts (most common with increasing age and few in number), developmental disorders
(e.g. multicystic dysplastic kidney), genetic causes (e.g. autosomal recessive (ARPKD) and
dominant (ADPKD) polycystic kidney disease), systemic diseases (e.g. Von Hippel–Lindau
syndrome and tuberous sclerosis) or malignancy in the form of cystic renal cell carcinoma. This patient has newly diagnosed ADPKD.
Unlike ARPKD that presents in childhood with renal failure and may be diagnosed prenatally, ADPKD is often clinically silent until it presents in adulthood, either with complications such as stones, haematuria, hypertension or renal failure (typically mean age
94

for endstage renal failure is over 50). However, as an autosomal dominant disease, the
patient may be aware of a family history of renal disease and may present for ultrasound
screening. Cysts may be seen in other organs and there is an association with cardiac and
vascular anomalies, such as intracranial berry aneurysms.

KEY POINTS

• There are many causes of renal cysts; sporadic simple cysts are the most common.
• ADPKD typically becomes symptomatic later in life and is a significant cause of
endstage renal failure.

CASE 31: UNABLE TO WEIGHT BEAR AFTER A CYCLING ACCIDENT
History
A 45-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department after collision
with a car while on her bicycle. She complains that the car hit her left knee from the side
and she is unable to bend the knee or support her weight. Previously she was fit and well.
Examination
She is initially immobilized with a hard collar. Her neck, chest and abdomen examination
is unremarkable and plain images of the neck, chest and pelvis are normal. The left knee
appears swollen and bruised but there is no penetrating injury. Plain anterior–posterior
(AP) and lateral radiographs of the knee are taken (Figure 31.1a,b).

(a)

Figure 31.1 (a) AP and (b) lateral radiographs of the left knee.

Questions
• What abnormality is seen?
• What would you do next?
97

ANSWER 31
There is a horizontal fat–fluid line, a lipohaemarthrosis, in the suprapatella pouch seen on
the cross-table horizontal lateral view. There is also a fracture of the lateral tibial plateau,
seen on the AP projection, with minimal displacement and loss of height.
A lipohaemarthrosis results from an intra-articular fracture with escape of fat and
blood from the bone marrow into the joint. Ideally the patient has been lying supine for
5 minutes to allow the fat and blood to separate. The fat rises and is less radio-opaque.
If seen, a lipohaemarthrosis indicates a tibial plateau or distal femoral fracture even if
the fracture is not apparent. Conversely, in a significant proportion of tibial fractures a
lipohaemarthrosis is not seen, although a haemarthrosis or effusion that appears as soft
tissue without a fluid level in the suprapatella bursa is likely to be present.
A computed tomography (CT) scan is done to image the extent of injury and plan surgery
(Figure 31.2).

Fat on
fluid level

(b)
Figure 31.2 (a) Axial and (b) sagittal CT slices of the right knee demonstrating the suprapatellar
lipohaemarthrosis.

There are a number of classification systems, such as the Schatzker classification, that
recognize patterns of fragmentation and displacement for tibial fractures. It is important
to recognize that a significant proportion of fractures will have associated meniscal, collateral and cruciate ligamentous injury. These are better assessed by magnetic resonance
(MR) which can also identify occult fractures.
Tibial plateau fractures may be either low or high energy. The majority of tibial plateau
fractures are in patients over 50 years. Osteoporosis in older women is a contributing
factor in low energy fractures and typically results in a depressed fracture. Tibial plateau
fractures in younger patients are commonly the result of high energy injuries. The most
common mechanism is a valgus force at the knee while weight bearing or with axial
loading, typically either road traffic accidents or sports-related injuries.
KEY POINTS

• A fat–fluid level in the suprapatella bursa indicates a lipohaemarthrosis and is likely to
indicate a tibial plateau fracture even if not seen on plain radiographs.

• Increased size of the suprapatella bursa most likely indicates an effusion or a haemarthrosis.
98

CASE 32:

STRANGE BONE APPEARANCE AFTER FALLING

History
A 77-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department after slipping
on ice and falling, hurting her left hip. She is unable to weight bear on her left leg. There
is no history of significant past joint pain or swelling. Before falling she had mildly
limited mobility but was otherwise active and well. Other than bendroflumethiazide for
hypertension there is no significant medical history.
Examination
The left leg is shortened with deformity around the hip. There is bruising over the lateral
aspect but no neurological or vascular abnormality is noted in the leg. Her observations
and the rest of the examination are normal.
You organize a pelvic and left hip radiograph and review a previous image of the left
hip (Figure 32.1).

Figure 32.1 Current AP pelvic radiographs
(left) and AP hip radiograph (right) from
1 year earlier.

Questions
• What abnormality is seen on the pelvic
radiograph.
• What is the differential diagnosis for
this appearance?
• What would you do next?

99

ANSWER 32
The pelvic radiograph shows a fracture through the proximal femoral shaft with displacement of the distal femur and angulation of the proximal fragment. The radiographs also
show a longstanding abnormal bony appearance of most of the left femur with expansion
(compared with the right), cortical thickening and trabecular coarsening, most prominent
around the femoral head and neck. There is also bowing of the femoral shaft.
The differential diagnosis includes Paget’s disease, osteomyelitis, metastatic carcinoma
and myelofibrosis. Trabecular coarsening and cortical thickening is quite characteristic
of Paget’s disease. There is no history or other findings to suggest metastatic cancer
(typically multiple sclerotic lesions in breast or prostatic cancer) or osteomyelitis, and the
asymmetry makes myelofibrosis less likely.
Paget’s disease is a disorder of bone remodelling which may occur in single or multiple
bones and typically affects spine, pelvis, femur and skull. The aetiology is not known,
however, the disease progresses through a resorption, lytic phase with excessive osteoclastic activity to a bone formation osteoblastic sclerotic phase with a mixed phase in
between. Paget’s disease occurs predominantly in older patients, affecting less than 3 per
cent of patients around 50, rising to as much as 10 per cent in the over 80s. There is a
slightly higher incidence in Europeans and males.
Figure 32.2 demonstrates Paget’s disease in other bones. In the spine, the vertebral bodies
typically become enlarged with a prominent cortical margin (picture frame vertebrae) or
become sclerotic, mimicking lymphoma or metastatic disease. In the pelvis, typical findings include thickening of the iliopectineal line (see arrows, Figure 32.2a) in early stages,
progressing to patchy sclerosis and lucency in later stages.

(a)

(b)

Figure 32.2 Paget’s disease in (a) the right side of the pelvis and (b) an L3 vertebral body of
different patients.

100

Complications of Paget disease depend on the bone and stage of disease. The majority
of people with Paget’s disease are asymptomatic, but those with symptoms may experience bone pain (most common symptom), osteoarthritis of adjacent joints, insufficiency
fractures, bowing of affected long bones, excessive warmth (due to hypervascularity) and
neurologic complications such as deafness and cranial nerve involvement, particularly
when the spine or skull is involved. Beware of sarcomatous change in 1 per cent of
patients (rising to 5–10 per cent if more than one bone is affected).

KEY POINTS

• Paget’s disease is usually asymptomatic and a not infrequent incidental finding in older
people.

• The disease typically affects spine, pelvis, femur and skull, and characteristically
demonstrates cortical thickening, trabecular coarsening late in the disease, although
lucency is a feature of early Paget’s disease.

CASE 33:

LOWER BACK PAIN

History
A 15-year-old girl presents to the accident and emergency department with lower back
pain following a fall while taking part in gymnastics at school. She complains of a history
of lower back discomfort. There is otherwise no significant medical history.
Examination
She is in pain but otherwise well. There is diffuse tenderness over the lower lumbar vertebrae but no point tenderness to suggest a fracture.
Anterior–posterior and lateral lumbar spine X-rays are obtained (Figure 33.1).

(a)

(b)

Figure 33.1 (a) Anterior–posterior and (b) lateral lumbar spine radiographs.

Questions
• What do the plain images show?
• Which part of the anatomy is affected?
• What other imaging would be helpful?

103

ANSWER 33
The lateral image demonstrates anterior slip of L5 on S1 by about 25 per cent of the vertebral
width, otherwise termed spondylolisthesis or anterolisthesis. The degree of slip is graded in
steps of 25 per cent (i.e. <25 per cent grade 1, 25–50 per cent grade 2, etc.). A lucency is seen
through the pars interarticularis – the portion of the neural arch that connects the superior
and inferior articular facets, suggesting a bony defect. This is otherwise known as spondylolysis. On oblique radiographs, the posterior elements form the appearance of a Scottie dog
and a break in the pars interarticularis has the appearance of a collar around the neck.
A computed tomography (CT) scan has been obtained to examine the bony structures
(Figure 33.2). Magnetic resonance (MR) would be useful if the nerve roots or spinal cord
need to be imaged, although the bony structures are less well seen.

(a)

(b)

(c)

Figure 33.2 (a) Axial, (b) sagittal and (c) oblique CT slices through the L5 vertebra showing
bilateral pars defects (see arrows), widening of the spinal canal and a ‘Scottie dog’ projection
with the pars defect representing the dog’s collar.

Spondylolysis is thought to be caused by stress fracturing of the pars from repeated
minor trauma and may occur early in life. Hereditary pars hypoplasia is also believed to
be a factor. Patients with spina bifida occulta have an increased risk for spondylolysis.
Spondylolysis can also occur secondary to neoplasm, osteomalacia, osteomyelitis and
bone disorders such as Paget’s disease and osteogenesis imperfecta.
The L5 vertebra is most frequently affected, a smaller proportion at L4 or L3, and it is
unusual for spondylolysis to occur at several levels. Seventy-five per cent are bilateral.
Lyses occur much less commonly at other lumbar or the thoracic levels.
Patients with bilateral pars defects can develop spondylolisthesis. The vertebral body slips
forward while the posterior elements remain fixed so that the spinal canal widens. Stability
is provided by the soft tissues and ligaments. Degenerative change is a more common cause
in older patients. Increased motion of the facet joints allows movement but slip of the intact
vertebra results in spinal canal stenosis and symptoms. Treatment depends on the type of slip,
age of patient and symptoms and ranges from conservative management to surgical fixation.
KEY POINTS

• Spondylolysis is a defect through the pars interarticularis, usually at L5 or L4, probably
the result of stress fracturing.

• Spondylolisthesis is slip, usually anteriorly, of one vertebral body on another and may
be the result of spondylolysis in younger patients or, more commonly, degenerative
change in older patients.
104

CASE 34:

VOMITING BABY BOY

History
A 6-week-old boy is referred urgently to the paediatric department by his general practitioner (GP) with a 1-week history of vomiting after feeds and weight loss. His mother
describes forceful vomiting occurring during or shortly after feeds; the vomit does not
appear bile stained. He appears to have normal appetite and no other symptoms. No other
members of the family seem affected.
Examination
The baby is apyrexial, mildly dehydrated with normal observations. The chest is clear and
abdomen soft and not distended. There is a small palpable mass in the right upper quadrant and after feeding some peristalsis under the skin in the epigastic region is observable.
You organize an ultrasound scan of the upper abdomen (Figure 34.1).

(a)

(b)

Figure 34.1 (a) Transverse and (b) longitudinal ultrasound images through the liver and adjacent
structures.

Questions
• Which organs lie immediately behind the liver?
• What is the differential and most likely diagnosis?
• Are there any risk factors?
• What is the treatment?

105

ANSWER 34
Figure 34.1a shows a transverse ultrasound view of the right upper quadrant with a
prominent tubular pylorus just behind the liver in keeping with pyloric stenosis. By
viewing the pylorus over a period of time (if baby allows), altered pyloric function can
be viewed with limited or absent flow of stomach contents through to the duodenum
and ineffective gastric peristalsis, which may sometimes be observable by eye. Pyloric
muscle thicker than 4 mm, length >17 mm and transverse diameter >14 mm are criteria
sometimes used, although this will depend on the age of the baby. Figure 34.2 shows
transverse ultrasound with measurements.
Pyloric stenosis is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infancy (2–4 per
1000). It is due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the muscular layers with thickening and
lengthening of the pylorus, causing functional gastric outlet obstruction. Typical
features are presentation at 2–8 weeks
(although can present up to 5 months). The
pylorus may be palpable, about the size of
a large olive. Forceful, projectile vomiting that is not bile stained is suggestive of
pyloric obstruction. Blood tests typically
indicate hypochloraemic alkalosis, due to
vomiting gastric acid, and dehydration.
The differential diagnosis includes:
• infections including gastroenteritis and
urinary tract;
• gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux, hiatus hernia;
• malrotation, pyloric atresia, web or diaphragm;
• congenital adrenal hyperplasia (due to
metabolic imbalance);
• poor feeding practices.

Figure 34.2 Transverse ultrasound with
measurements. The gastric mucosa is bright,
the muscle dark.

If the diagnosis is not clear on ultrasound, a contrast meal and follow through that
examines the stomach and small bowel is the next step. Pyloric stenosis typically shows
shouldering of the gastric antrum outlet with a long, narrow pyloric canal (string sign)
on a contrast meal. Malrotation and other causes of outflow obstruction also show characteristic appearances.
There is a higher incidence of pyloric stenosis in first-born boys (M:F 4:1). There is also
evidence for heritability and that the condition appears to be developmental rather than
congenital. The definitive treatment is surgical pyloromyotomy, where the pylorus muscle is cut longitudinally to release the pyloric tension.
KEY POINTS

• Pyloric stenosis typically presents within 2–12 weeks as non-bilious vomiting.
• Ultrasound appearances can be diagnostic with the pylorus appearing lengthened and
thickened and no significant flow of stomach contents through to the duodenum.
106

CASE 35:

PAINLESS HAEMATURIA

History
A 68-year-old woman is referred to the radiology department for an urgent chest radiograph after an abnormality is noted in the left kidney on ultrasound in the urology clinic.
She has a recent history of painless haematuria.
Examination
There is little of note on general examination except that she looks thin. There is mild
diffuse tenderness in the right loin and a possible ballotable mass on the right.
You review the chest radiograph (Figure 35.1) before the patient leaves the department.

Figure 35.1 Posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the radiograph show?
• What is the differential for this appearance?
• What imaging would you do next?

107

ANSWER 35
The chest radiograph shows several circular soft tissue lesions in both hemithoraces, most
prominent on the left.
The first issue is how to describe the lesions. Convention is that a ‘nodule’ is smaller and
a ‘mass’ larger than 3 cm. Nodules can be thought of as miliary (multiple, with size and
appearance of seeds), small (2–5 mm) or large (>5 mm). They may be single or multiple,
discrete or confluent, uniform or variable in size, contain calcification or cavities and be
associated with lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions or pleural or rib lesions. Noting these
features can help to narrow down the list of differentials.
In this case the list of differentials for multiple variable size soft tissue pulmonary nodules includes metastases, Wegener’s granulomatosis, rheumatoid nodules, sarcoidosis,
amyloidosis (often calcified), arteriovenous malformations and abscesses. Most likely are
metastases from a possible renal primary. Metastases often have a rounded mass appearance, having grown rapidly from a bloodborne deposit, whereas primary lung tumours
often have an irregular, infiltrative or spiculated appearance.
The lungs are one of the most common sites for haematogenous spread of tumours,
particularly from kidney, osteosarcoma, thyroid, melanoma and breast. When that list
is adjusted for tumour incidence, lung metastases are most commonly seen for breast,
kidney, head and neck, and colorectal tumours.
A computed tomography (CT) scan to characterize the kidney lesion and to stage the
disease is required (Figure 35.2). In particular, evidence of any growth of the tumour
into surrounding structures or lymph nodes or into the renal vein or opposite kidney will
alter the treatment. Renal tumours account for 3 per cent of adult tumours and the large
majority are renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Thirty per cent of patients with RCC present
with metastases, which in addition to lung occur in soft tissue, bone and liver.

Figure 35.2 Axial contrast-enhanced CT
through the kidneys showing a large left renal
tumour.

KEY POINTS

• The size, number, distribution and properties of lung nodules can help decide the
differential diagnosis.

• Kidney, osteosarcoma, thyroid, melanoma and breast tumours most commonly
metastasize to the lungs.

• Renal cell carcinoma is the most common adult kidney cancer.
108

CASE 36: SUDDEN ONSET WEAKNESS IN AN 80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
History
An 80-year-old woman was brought into the accident and emergency department from
her sheltered accommodation with sudden onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech.
She is not known to have had a previous stroke or neurological symptoms. She has a past
history of chronic obstructuve pulmonary disease (COPD) and 50 pack-years smoking.
Examination
There is right-sided leg and arm weakness (3/5), mild slurring of speech and left facial
droop. The chest is clear and abdomen soft and non-tender. Observations show a regular
heart rate of 72/minute, blood pressure of 132/82 and no pyrexia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is arranged (Figure 36.1).

(a)

(b)

Figure 36.1 Axial CT slices through brain at two levels: (a) images without contrast; (b) images
with contrast.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis for ‘stroke’?
• What does the CT demonstrate?
• Is contrast used regularly for head CTs?
• What is your most likely diagnosis and what other investigations would you arrange?
109

ANSWER 36
The aim of imaging is early diagnosis and to differentiate ischaemic and haemorrhagic
stroke. Stroke mimics include space-occupying lesions such as tumours, haematomas,
arterial dissections, abscess and acute infection (often a urinary tract infection) in
patients with chronic cerebral degeneration such as dementia.
The computed tomography (CT) shows low attenuation regions within the subcortical white
matter of the superior right frontal lobe and posterior left frontal lobe in the region of the
motor cortex. A small central high attenuation area is in keeping with haemorrhage with
surrounding white matter oedema. Post contrast, both regions show avid ring enhancement.
Head CTs are almost always initially non-contrast. This is primarily to avoid obscuring
acute haemorrhage or haematoma that has mildly increased attenuation compared with
the surrounding brain. It also allows calcification to be identified. There are a number
of locations where calcification accumulates physiologically, including the choroid plexi
(posterior horns of the lateral ventricles), pineal gland and habenula (posterior end of the
third ventricle), falx, basal ganglia and vascular atheroma. Physiological calcification is
often symmetrically arranged or on the midline. Other calcifications may arise in lesions
associated with tumours (e.g. meningiomas), infection, arteriovenous malformations or
aneurysms, old haemorrhage and past surgery.
Contrast is given to improve the visibility of the vasculature (e.g. aneurysm, arterovenous
malformation) or lesions that often have abnormal vessels with defective blood–brain
barrier so that contrast is retained in the tissue.
The ring-enhancing lesions in this patient’s
case are most likely to be metastatic
tumour deposits from a remote primary. A
primary brain tumour is less likely in this
age group and the clinical picture is not
typical for brain abscesses, although the
appearance would be quite similar. A chest
radiograph would be the next investigation
(Figure 36.2), given the history of smoking, although a staging CT of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis would be required for
treatment planning.
Only a few tumours account for about
95 per cent of brain metastases, most
commonly bronchial carcinoma, breast,
gastrointestinal tract, renal cell carcinoma
and melanoma.

Figure 36.2 Chest radiograph showing a right
mid zone mass and hilar lymphadenopathy.

KEY POINTS

• Although infarction is the most common cause of stroke symptoms, if the patient is
•
110

young or the history is inconsistent, consider stroke mimics such as tumours or arterial
dissections.
Bronchial cancer is the most common metastasis to the brain.

CASE 37:

YOUNG MAN WITH ANKLE PAIN

History
A 20-year-old man presents to the accident and emergency department with a painful
right ankle after twisting during football practice. He is barely able to put his weight on
the foot. The description sounds like an eversion injury. There is no other or previous
injury and the patient is otherwise fit and well. There is no significant medical history.
Examination
On examination the patient appears fit and well but in pain. There is swelling and tenderness over the right lateral malleolus. There is reduced range of movement at the ankle
joint. Observations are normal and there are no other significant findings.
You arrange radiographs of the ankle (Figure 37.1).

Questions
• What do the radiographs show?
• How would you describe the abnormality?
• What are the features that help with a differential diagnosis?
• What are your most likely differentials?

111

ANSWER 37
The radiographs show a well-defined sclerotic lesion that is eccentrically positioned in
the distal femoral diaphysis. It appears to arise from the cortex and there is no associated
bony expansion, soft tissue swelling or periosteal reaction. The ankle joint is normally
positioned and regular in appearance. No fracture is seen. There is soft tissue swelling
over the lateral malleolus.
When reviewing the ankle it is important to check the joint space between the talus and
tibia/fibula which should be the same throughout. Small irregularities within the joint
space might indicate an osteochondral defect. Check for avulsion below the fibula and
posterior to the fifth metatarsal. Take care not to confuse fractures with ossicles commonly in this position and also posterior to the tibia.
There is quite a structured way of describing bony abnormalities that helps with deriving
a differential diagnosis. Consider:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

age;
number of lesions (may require more imaging);
location;
position within the bone (i.e. diaphysis, metaphysis, epiphysis, subarticular, cortex or
medulla);
density (sclerotic, lytic or mixed);
borders – zone of transition well defined (narrow) or poorly defined;
bony change – expansion, coarsened trabeculae, moth eaten (irregular holes also
termed permeative lucency), osteopenia;
periosteal reaction – lamellar, spiculated (tends to be associated with aggressive processes and can be hair on end, e.g. Ewing sarcoma, or sunray, e.g. metastases).

This patient’s lesion is a solitary sclerotic cortical lesion with benign appearance and, in
this age group, a healing fibrous cortical defect is most likely. The differential includes
osteoid osteoma (particularly with a central lucency or nidus). Less likely is a bone
infarct (check for history of sickle cell disease, steroids), bone island or fibrous dysplasia.
Unlikely is metastasis (age, appearance), primary bone sarcoma or osteomyelitis (typically
aggressive periosteal reaction).
A fibrous cortical defect (or non-ossifying fibroma if greater than 2 cm) is the most frequent benign bony lesion in children and adolescents. These lesions are developmental
abnormalities and usually an incidental finding on radiographs. The lesion develops in
the distal metaphysis of a long bone as a radiolucent and eccentrically located lesion,
with thin cortex and sclerotic or scalloped margins while the growth plate is open. There
is typically spontaneous healing with sclerosis once the growth plate has ossified. Surgery
is considered if there is risk of a fracture (occupying greater than 50 per cent of the transverse diameter), symptoms or enlargement.
KEY POINTS

• A good description of the lesion helps with deriving a differential diagnosis.
• Age is one of the main discriminators in deciding differentials.

CASE 38:

PAINFUL SHOULDER

History
A 45-year-old man slipped and fell backwards onto his outstretched right arm. He
presents complaining of severe shoulder pain and loss of movement. The shoulder is also
swollen.
Examination
The patient holds his arm in slight abduction and external rotation. The shoulder is
‘squared off’ (i.e. box-like) with loss of deltoid contour compared with opposite side. The
humeral head is just palpable anteriorly below the clavicle in the subcoracoid area. A
careful assessment is made to check his radial pulses for a vascular injury and the axillary
nerve function for regimental badge sensory loss over the deltoid and deltoid contraction
on attempted abduction. Plain images are taken of the shoulder (Figure 38.1).

Figure 38.1 Posterior–anterior (PA) view of the right shoulder.

Questions
• What differential diagnoses should you consider?
• What complications can arise?
• What further imaging would be helpful?

113

ANSWER 38
The history and examination all suggest an anterior shoulder dislocation. Often in the
case of trauma, shoulder injuries have to be assessed initially on the basis of a PA projection, which in this case confirms displacement of the humeral head inferiorly relative to
the glenoid. Axial and Y views are nearly perpendicular to the PA projection and show
the position of the humeral head. Figure 38.2 shows the humeral head anterior to the
glenoid.

(a)
(b)
Figure 38.2 (a) Y view facing the glenoid fossa with the scapula describing a Y; (b) axial view
of the right shoulder.

The imaging helps to distinguish the differential diagnosis of glenohumeral dislocation,
of which anterior dislocation (96 per cent) is much more frequent than posterior (3 per
cent) and inferior (1 per cent). Pseudo dislocation, where the humeral head is subluxed
but not consistently dislocated, is associated with chronic shoulder joint instability, brachial plexus injury or haemarthrosis. Acromioclavicular dislocation and sternoclavicular
dislocation should also be considered although much less common.
Posterior dislocations characteristically occur in trauma or seizure and can be harder to
recognize, particularly if an axial or Y view has not been obtained. Suspicious features
include fixed internal rotation (lightbulb sign), widening of the glenohumeral joint space
(rim sign) with loss of overlap of the humerus over the glenoid.
Anterior dislocation can be associated with fracture of the greater tuberosity, anterior tear
of the glenoid labrum (Bankart lesion), fracture of the anterior rim of the glenoid and an
impaction fracture of the posterolateral surface of the humeral head (Hill–Sachs lesion)
where it impacts on the glenoid rim. If not identified, recurrent dislocations are likely.
The rotator cuff muscles may also be injured by traction.
Treatment requires adequate analgesia and sedation before relocating the joint. Imaging
and neurovascular examination is performed before and after reduction.
114

Magnetic resonance (MR) is the investigation of choice to follow up a shoulder dislocation, particularly in younger patients who are more at risk of recurrent dislocations.
Contrast injection into the joint (an arthrogram) may be required to see labral injuries
reliably.

KEY POINTS

• Anterior dislocations are much the commonest type of shoulder dislocation.
• Two views are required to identify dislocation, particularly posterior dislocations.
• The risk of recurrent dislocations increases with younger age and further imaging with
MR may be required.

CASE 39:

CHEST PAIN AFTER FALLING

History
A 75-year-old man is brought to his general practice by his daughter. He complains of
left-sided chest pain on inspiration. On further questioning it becomes apparent that he
has had a recent fall. He lives alone and independently with frequent visits from his
daughter who is concerned that there have been several falls. The patient is on blood
pressure medication and takes a statin for previously high cholesterol. Reviewing his
notes you see a previous attendance 2 years earlier for a fall and several episodes of
treatment for pneumonia. There is a past history of smoking but no other significant
medical history.
Examination
The observations are normal. He is thin. There is some bruising over the left side of the
thorax and a notable low thoracic kyphosis. There are bilateral fine inspiratory crackles.
The heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is unremarkable and no neurological or significant cognitive abnormality is noted.
A chest radiograph (Figure 39.1), electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are arranged.

Figure 39.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the radiograph show?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What further imaging would you consider?
• What other investigations should you consider?

117

ANSWER 39
Although the history and examination make rib fractures very likely, radiology is rarely
indicated simply to look for low energy traumatic rib fractures. In this patient’s case there
are questions as to the cause of the fall. A chest radiograph is indicated for a possible
chest infection or lesion and a thoracolumbar spine radiograph for the possible cause of
the kyphosis.
The chest radiograph shows recent fractures of the left sixth to ninth ribs posterolaterally.
There are also old fractures of the right ribs posterolaterally. Features that are common
in trauma are fractures in a line and a posterolateral position, although this will depend
on the type of trauma. Old fractures have healed and the bone cortex is continuous but
the rib may be distorted. Recent and new fractures have discontinuous cortex but recent
fractures show signs of healing with callus and bone remodelling that is absent in new
fractures.
Do not stop looking once you have seen the fractures! Also look for other fractures (e.g.
spine), bone lesions and examine the lungs, pleura and heart. On this radiograph there
is consolidation in the right lower zone and a probable hiatus hernia gas bubble behind
the heart.
The spine radiograph reported wedge compression fractures of the T11 and T12 vertebral
bodies together with some small sclerotic and lytic lesions in the lumbar vertebrae. The
initial blood tests show iron deficiency anaemia and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR). This suggests an underlying systemic disease that affects bone and includes bowel
or chest malignancy with bone metastases, myeloma or prostate carcinoma. The patient
should be referred to the older person team for further investigation. From an imaging
point of view this probably includes a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis, although a bone scan could be helpful if sclerotic bone metastases
from prostate or bowel carcinoma are suspected.
If blood tests suggest myeloma, a skeletal survey for lytic lesions could be done. Bone
scans have lower sensitivity for lytic bone lesions which appear as photopenic regions
of reduced uptake. The tracer used in bone scans, 99Tc-MDP (technetium-99 conjugated
with methylene diphosphonate), is taken up primarily by osteoblastic activity typical in
sclerotic bone lesions.
The National Service Framework for older person care recommends a formal falls assessment in patients at risk and regular medication review.
KEY POINTS

• Radiology is rarely indicated simply to look for rib fractures.
• In older patients the ‘Occam’s razor’ approach of assuming only one underlying
pathology has to be modified to allow for several interacting pathologies.

• Avoid ‘satisfaction of search’ and keep looking after spotting the first abnormality.

CASE 40:

SWELLING OF THE BIG TOE

History
A 57-year-old man presents to his general practitioner (GP) with pain and swelling of his
left big toe. He reported that this had been a longstanding problem over the last 7 years
but had just put it down to ‘old age’ and did not want to trouble his GP with it. The pain
and swelling would come and go in waves. He noted, however, that these episodes were
now more frequent and he would struggle to weight bear on that side at times. On this
occasion the pain had suddenly started at night and had been getting worse in flares ever
since. In his past medical history he had a hernia operation 14 years ago. He was on treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidaemia with bendroflumethiazide and simvastatin,
respectively. He is an ex-smoker and drinks 14 units of alcohol per week. He is not aware
of any history of trauma.
Examination
Examination revealed a tender, erythematous right big toe with a markedly reduced
range of motion at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. He had a moderately raised white
cell count of 12 and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was also raised. Serum
urate levels were elevated. He was afebrile and observations were otherwise normal.
Radiographs of the foot were taken (Figure 40.1).

(a)
(b)
Figure 40.1 (a) Anterior–posterior and (b) oblique radiographs of the foot.

Questions
• What do the radiographs of the foot demonstrate?

119

ANSWER 40
Figure 40.1 demonstrates ‘punched-out’ lytic bone lesions with overhanging edges
involving the first metatarsophalangeal joint with marginal sclerosis. There is the appearance of ‘rat bites’ with an overlying calcified soft-tissue swelling. These classical findings
are consistent with longstanding gout.
Gout is defined as a peripheral arthritis that results from the deposition of sodium urate
crystals in one or more joints. It has many contributing factors, but two central processes
are involved in its development: the overproduction of uric acid and the underexcretion
of uric acid. A multitude of conditions, including renal disease, have been implicated,
but the vast majority of cases are idiopathic. Podagra (another name for pain in the first
metatarsophalangeal joint) is the classic presentation of gout. In general, the symptoms
of gout appear suddenly at night and occur in men with hyperuricaemia who are aged
30–60 years.
Gout is also associated with hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, kidney failure, obesity and
insulin resistance. Other ‘social’ factors such as alcohol intake also increase the risk of
gout. An increase in uric acid levels and resulting precipitation of gout is a side effect
of thiazide diuretics.
Patients with new onset of acute gout usually have no radiographic findings and the
classic features seen in this case are usually not seen until 6–12 years after initial attack.
Early radiologic findings in gout are limited to the soft tissues and involve asymmetric
swelling in the affected joints. There is preservation of joint space initially. In the intermediate stage of disease, gout causes subtle changes in the bony structures on plain film
radiographs. In the periphery of affected joints, small ‘punched-out’ lytic bone lesions
arise, often with sclerosis of margin. Obtaining two views is important to appreciate
these subtle findings. Definitive diagnosis is made by finding the negatively birefringent
crystals on polarized microscopy of synovial fluid aspirate.
The hallmark sign of late-phase gout is the appearance of large and numerous interosseous tophi on plain film radiographs. Calcific deposits in gouty tophi are seen in
approximately 50 per cent of cases (only calcium urate crystals are opaque) and ‘mouse/
rat bite’ erosions develop due to longstanding soft tissue tophi. Joint space narrowing
and cartilage destruction is seen late in the course of the disease.
KEY POINTS

• Classical plain radiographic features of longstanding gout include ‘punched-out’ lytic
•

120

bone lesions with overhanging edges, marginal sclerosis and the appearance of ‘rat
bites’ with an overlying calcified soft tissue swelling (tophus).
These features usually are not usually seen until several years after initial attack and are
present in around 50 per cent of patients.

CASE 41:

A YOUNG MAN WITH PROGRESSIVE DYSPNOEA ON

EXERTION
History
A 38-year-old man presents to his general practitioner (GP) with progressive dyspnoea
on exertion developing steadily over the past 2 months. He says that he is now unable to
walk 100 m before becoming severely short of breath and having to stop. He also noted
the development of a non-productive cough over a similar time scale and more recently
developing a fever. He had never experienced anything like this before and was previously fit and well with no past medical history of note. In his social history he reported
having unprotected sex with both men and women.
Examination
On examination his respiratory rate was 22 per minute, fever (with a temperature of
37.9°C), a few crackles and wheezes over both lung fields. On the basis of the examination
the GP sent the patient to the accident and emergency department.
In casualty, oxygen saturation was 90 per cent breathing air. Haematology results showed
a normal white cell count. Biochemistry and liver function tests were normal. A retroviral screen showed he was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive with a CD4
count below 200 cells/μL, consistent with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
He was referred for a chest radiograph (Figure 41.1), on the basis of which a computed
tomography (CT) was requested and performed (Figure 41.2).

Figure 41.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 41.2 CT scan.

Questions
• What is the likely cause of his increasing shortness of breath?
• What do the chest radiograph (Figure 41.1) and subsequent CT scan (Figure 41.2)
show?

121

ANSWER 41
The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical history and imaging findings is pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or pneumocystosis, which is a form of pneumonia, caused by the
yeast-like fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. The older name Pneumocystis carinii (which now
only applies to the Pneumocystis variant that occurs in animals) is still in common usage.
Plain chest radiograph (Figure 41.1) demonstrates perihilar interstitial reticular shadowing with cyst formation. There is relative sparing of the apices and both bases. The axial
enhanced CT image at the level of the pulmonary trunk (Figure 41.2) demonstrates perihilar
ground-glass change and cystic changes, indicating the development of pneumatoceles.
Pneumocystis organisms are commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals. It is
believed most children have been exposed to the organism by the age of 4 years, and
its occurrence is worldwide. The organism is a rare cause of infection in the general
population, however it is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in persons who are
immunocompromised, especially patients with AIDS.
Patients who do not have AIDS but are immunocompromised and at risk for PCP include
individuals with haematologic malignancies, organ transplant recipients and those
receiving long-term steroid or cytotoxic therapy, including patients with systemic vasculitis or other autoimmune deficiency. Other patients with immune deficiency disorders
who are at particular risk for PCP include those with thymic dysplasia, those with severe
combined immunodeficiency, and those with hypogammaglobulinaemia. Severe malnutrition may also predispose individuals to PCP.
The risk of pneumonia due to PCP increases when CD4 levels are less than 200 cells/μL.
The symptoms of PCP are non-specific. PCP in patients with HIV infection tends to run a
more subacute, indolent course and tends to present much later, often after several weeks
of symptoms, compared with PCP associated with other immunocompromising conditions.
Chest radiographs should be included in the initial evaluation for PCP. Frequently, these
are the only images required. Characteristically, the distribution is central in location
with bilateral diffuse symmetric finely granular, reticular interstitial/airspace infiltrates
with perihilar and basilar distribution. Chest radiograph is normal in 10–39 per cent of
patients with PCP. Hilar lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions are uncommon (seen in
less than 5 per cent).
CT (in particular, high-resolution CT) scanning is more sensitive than chest radiography for
the detection and exclusion of PCP pneumonia, and the results may be positive when chest
radiograph findings are normal. CT findings include patchwork pattern bilateral asymmetric
patchy mosaic appearance with sparing of segments/subsegments of pulmonary lobe or a
‘ground-glass’ pattern as in this case with bilateral diffuse airspace disease (fluid + inflammatory cells in alveolar space) in symmetric distribution. Cysts are visible on chest radiographs
in 10 per cent of patients, although these are appreciated far more commonly on HRCT scans
(33 per cent). Findings of cysts or pneumatoceles are not infrequent in patients with PCP.
KEY POINTS

• PCP is the most common cause of interstitial pneumonia in immunocompromised
patients, which quickly leads to airspace disease.

• Chest radiograph findings may be normal in a significant number of patients with PCP.
• The classical chest radiograph features of PCP pneumonia, when present, are bilateral,
diffuse, often perihilar, fine, reticular interstitial opacification, which appears to be granular.

CASE 42:

PAIN ON DEEP INSPIRATION

History
A 67-year-old man presents to the accident and emergency department as a referral
from his general practitioner (GP). Over the course of the preceding 12 hours he has been
experiencing pain in the left side of his chest, worst on deep inspiration. This is the first
ever such episode and he describes the pain as sharp and stabbing. He is an ex-smoker
with a 30 pack-year history. Emphysematous changes have been noted on a previous
chest radiograph and he takes a salbutamol inhaler as required along with an inhaled
corticosteroid regularly. Aside from a history of mild to moderate chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease he was otherwise well. He denies any history of trauma.
Examination
He is tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 33/minute and tachycardic with a heart rate
of 104/minute which electrocardiogram (ECG) confirms as sinus rhythm with no acute
changes. On examination of the respiratory system there is reduced expansion, a slightly
hyperresonant percussion note and reduced air entry on the left. Vocal resonance is also
reduced on the left. No added sounds are identified, however. Full blood count (FBC),
biochemistry and liver function tests are all normal. Blood gas analysis demonstrates
a PaO2 of 9 kPa with a PaCO2 of 4.5 kPa. The patient is referred for a chest radiograph
(Figure 42.1).

Figure 42.1 Posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph.

Questions
• What abnormality do you see on the chest radiograph?
• What concerning features would you look for?
• How would you manage this patient?
123

ANSWER 42
The PA chest radiograph (Figure 42.1) shows a large left pneumothorax, which appears
tethered to the left costal pleura. There is a background of emphysematous change but no
evidence of mediastinal shift to suggest that the pneumothorax is under tension, which
would be an alarming feature requiring immediate intervention.
Pneumothorax refers to the presence of air within the pleural space. Diagnosis is established on the plain chest radiograph by demonstrating an outer margin of the visceral
pleura known as the pleural line (delineating collapsed lung), separated from the parietal
pleura (chest wall) by a lucent space occupied by gas and devoid of any pulmonary
markings.
The pleural line demonstrating the margin of collapsed lung can sometimes be difficult
to detect in cases of a small pneumothorax. It is important to note that a skin fold may
mimic the pleural line. When a pneumothorax is suspected but not confirmed on inspiratory radiograph, an expiratory image may confirm the diagnosis. This is because at the
end of expiration, the constant volume of the gas within the pneumothorax is accentuated by the reduction of the hemithorax.
Chest radiography is the first investigation performed to assess pneumothorax, because it
is straightforward, rapid, cheap and non-invasive. CT may be used in more complex cases,
for example in planning pleurodesis (usually in recurrent pneumothoraces) and it is more
sensitive than plain radiographs in detecting blebs or bullae or a small pneumothorax.
Pneumothorax is classified as spontaneous (atraumatic), traumatic, or iatrogenic:
• Spontaneous pneumothorax may be either primary (occurring in persons without
clinically or radiologically apparent lung disease) or secondary (in which lung disease
is present and apparent, as in this example). Most individuals with primary spontaneous pneumothorax have unrecognized lung disease; it is often thought to occur due
to rupture of a subpleural bleb.
• Traumatic pneumothorax is caused by penetrating or blunt trauma to the chest. Gas
enters the pleural space directly through the chest wall through visceral pleural penetration or alveolar rupture resulting from sudden compression of the chest.
• Iatrogenic pneumothorax results from a complication of a diagnostic or therapeutic
intervention. With the increasing use of invasive diagnostic procedures, iatrogenic
pneumothorax has become more common.
In this large secondary pneumothorax with significant symptoms drainage is required to
remove the air from the pleural space. Needle aspiration is not usually adequate in such
cases and insertion of an intercostal drain is required. This has been done in Figure 42.2
with some resulting but as yet incomplete re-expansion of the collapsed left lung.

124

Figure 42.2 Chest radiograph post drainage.

KEY POINTS

• In the erect position, pleural gas collects over the apex where the space between the
lung and the chest wall is most notable.

• It is important to assess for radiographic manifestations of tension pneumothorax are
mediastinal shift, diaphragmatic depression and rib cage expansion.

• Tension pneumothorax is an emergency requiring immediate intervention.

CASE 43:

AN ELBOW INJURY

History
A 45-year-old woman attends the accident and emergency department following a fall
off a stepladder from a height of 1 metre onto her outstretched right arm while decorating at home. She immediately noted marked pain and is unable to flex or extend the
elbow joint. She is previously fit and well, with no previous illnesses. She is right hand
dominant.
Examination
She is unable to pronate or supinate the forearm and unable to flex or extend the elbow.
She demonstrates bony tenderness maximal over the radial head and there is swelling of
the elbow joint. Her arm pulses are intact distally, capillary refill is less than 2 seconds,
and sensation and power in the hand and wrist are normal. Plain radiographs are taken
(Figure 43.1a,b).

(a)
(b)
Figure 43.1 (a) Lateral and (b) magnified anterior–posterior (AP) images.

Question
• What is the likely injury?
• What do the plain radiographs show?

127

ANSWER 43
The lateral radiograph (Figure 43.1a) demonstrates elevated anterior and posterior elbow
fat pads, suggesting a joint effusion and is suspicious for an occult fracture. The magnified AP image (Figure 43.1b) confirms a fracture of the radial head.
The preferred study for the evaluation of elbow trauma is conventional radiography and
the radiographic examination requires the acquisition of two views: the lateral view, ideally in 90 degree flexion, and AP view in full extension.
The classic elbow ‘fat pad’ sign seen on lateral elbow radiograph is an invaluable soft tissue
finding in cases of intra-articular injury of the elbow. Fat is normally present within the
joint capsule of the elbow, but outside the synovium. As it is usually ‘hidden’ in the concavity of the olecranon and coronoid fossae, fat is usually not visible on the lateral radiograph.
Injuries causing intra-articular haemorrhage/effusion, however, cause distension of the
synovium which forces the fat out of the fossa, producing triangular radiolucent shadows anterior and posterior to the distal end of the humerus – the radiographic sail sign
(Figure 43.2).
The posterior fat pad (black arrow – Figure
43.2) is not normally seen on radiographs
and its presence is always an abnormal
finding that requires further investigation
for an occult fracture.
The anterior fat pad may be normally visualized on lateral radiographs as a triangular radiolucency, although in the presence
of joint effusion it is displaced anteriorly,
becoming more pronounced and the anterior
margin becomes convex. Fat pad signs may
not be evident if the fracture is extracapsular.
Fracture of the radial head is the most
common type of elbow fracture in adults,
Figure 43.2
whereas fractures of the radial neck are
more common in children. Fractures of the
radial head and neck of the radius generally result from a hard fall on an outstretched
hand with the impact of fall driving the head of radius axially onto the capitulum of the
humerus.
Treatment depends on the degree of displacement, angulation and articular involvement.
Minor degrees such as that shown are often treated by early mobilization in a brace to
minimize later elbow stiffness.

KEY POINTS

• Radiographic examination requires two views: AP view in full extension and lateral
view, ideally in 90 degrees of flexion.

• The posterior fat pad is not normally seen on radiographs, and its presence is always
an abnormal finding that should prompt further investigation for occult fractures.

• Fat pad signs may not be evident if the fracture is extracapsular.

CASE 44:

PAIN IN THE HAND FOLLOWING A PUNCHING INJURY

History
A 22-year-old man attends the accident and emergency department following a fight. He
remembers punching another man and, although intoxicated, is complaining of pain in
the knuckles. He is otherwise fit and well.
Examination
On examination his knuckles are swollen and tender to palpation. There is maximal tenderness in the region of the fifth metacarpal head (base of the little finger) with virtually
no range of movement at the fifth metacarpophalangeal joint. Neurovascular function is
intact distally. Plain radiographs are taken (Figure 44.1).

(a)
(b)
Figure 44.1 (a) Anterior–posterior (AP) and (b) oblique plain radiographs.

Questions
• What is the likely injury?
• Describe the injury seen in the plain radiographs of the hand.

129

ANSWER 44
The AP and oblique images of the hand demonstrate a metacarpal neck fracture, with
volar angulation and displacement of the distal fragment. Note also prominent soft tissue
swelling of the hand.
A ‘boxer’s fracture’ is the common name for a fracture involving the neck of the fifth
metacarpal, which forms the knuckle of the little finger (but the same name may also
be used for a fracture at the neck of any of the metacarpals). It is usually caused by the
impact of a clenched fist with a skull or a hard, immovable object.
Only the collateral ligaments remain attached to the proximal phalanx and therefore
the metacarpal head is freed from any proximal stabilizing influence. The metacarpal
head tilts volarly, causing the joint to lie in hyperextension and the collateral ligaments
become slack. If the joint is allowed to remain in hyperextension, collateral ligaments will
shorten, leading to limited metacarpophalangeal flexion.
The little finger carpometacarpal articulation allows a flexion–extension arc of 20–30
degrees in addition to a rotatory motion, facilitating little finger opposition to thumb.
A true lateral radiograph is necessary with these fractures in order to measure the angle
of displacement of the distal fragment. The normal metacarpal neck angle is about
15 degrees and therefore a measured angle on film of 30 degrees is actually approximately 15 degrees.
These fractures are often angulated, and if severely so, require pins to be put in place
and realignment as well as the usual splinting. However, the prognosis on these fractures
is generally good.
KEY POINTS

• A boxer’s fracture is the common name for a break in the end of the little finger
metacarpal bone, also known as a fifth metacarpal fracture.

• The injury is commonly caused by punching something harder than the hand, for
example, a wall. The end of the metacarpal bone takes the brunt of the impact, which
usually breaks through the neck (which is the narrowest area near the end) and bends
down toward the palm.

CASE 45:

A FALL ON THE HAND AND PAIN IN THE WRIST

History
A 20-year-old man attends the accident and emergency department following a fall onto
his flexed left wrist while playing football.
Examination
He demonstrates a markedly reduced range of movement and is complaining of point
tenderness on the dorsum and ulnar aspect of the left wrist. There is no pain on palpation
of the anatomical snuffbox or upon axial loading of the thumb. Radiographs are taken
(Figures 45.1 and 45.2).

Figure 45.1 (a) Anterior–posterior (AP) view of the left
wrist.

Figure 45.2 Lateral view of the
left wrist.

Questions
• What injury do you suspect he may have sustained?
• What do the wrist radiographs demonstrate?
131

ANSWER 45
Triquetral fractures typically occur from a hyperextension injury with the wrist in ulnar
deviation, however, can also occur with hyperflexion. Either the dorsal or volar radiotriquetral ligaments may avulse triquetral fragments at their attachments. Behind fractures of the scaphoid, triquetral fractures are the second most common carpal bone to
fracture. They are frequently seen as dorsal chip fractures only on the lateral projection
(Figure 45.2) since the pisiform usually overlies the triquetrum on the frontal projection
of the wrist (Figure 45.1). In this case there is a small avulsion from the dorsum of the
triquetrum seen only on the lateral projection (arrow, Figure 45.3).

Figure 45.3 Lateral view of the left wrist indicating the fracture.

Patients will usually complain of localized tenderness on the dorsum of the wrist.
The triquetrum may be identified by its pyramidal shape and by an oval isolated facet for
articulation with the pisiform bone. It is situated just distal to the ulna and the triangular
fibrocartilage complex, proximal to the base of the hamate.
The superior surface presents a medial, rough, non-articular portion, and a lateral convex
articular portion, which articulates with the triangular articular disc of the wrist. The inferior surface, directed laterally, is concave, sinuously curved and smooth for articulation
with the hamate. The dorsal surface is rough for the attachment of ligaments. The triquetrum articulates on its radial side with the lunate to which it is attached by the lunotriquetral ligament. On the volar (palmar) aspect there is an articulation with the pisiform.
Triquetral fractures may divided into two types:
• Chip fractures: A chip fracture, usually off the dorsal radial surface, typically occurs
with a wrist hyperextension injury. Chip fractures can also occur with the hyperflexion.
• Mid-body fracture: Fractures through the mid-body of the triquetrum are less frequent than a chip fracture. This type of fracture is usually due to a direct blow, or
may occur in conjunction with a perilunate dislocation. The dislocation may have
been reduced, so a triquetral fracture from the proximal radial aspect of the bone may
indicate the presence of a former dislocation.
KEY POINTS

• Triquetral fractures are the second most common fracture of the carpal bones.
• They are frequently seen as dorsal chip fractures only on the lateral projection as the
pisiform usually overlies the triquetrum on the AP projection of the wrist.

CASE 46:

SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND PLEURITIC CHEST PAIN

History
A 55-year-old man is admitted to the accident and emergency department complaining
of gradual onset of shortness of breath over the course of several hours along with rightsided chest pain aggravated by deep inspiration. He is complaining of mild lightheadedness and feels the symptoms are getting worse. The pain is sharp and stabbing in nature.
He was previously fit and well. One day earlier he returned on a long haul flight from a
business trip to Asia. He denies any history of leg swelling.
Examination
Upon admission to hospital his oxygen saturation on air was 94 per cent and his respiratory rate was 20/minute. A chest radiograph failed to demonstrate any focal lesion.
Routine bloods were normal although D-dimer performed in the emergency department
was elevated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated a mild sinus tachycardia heart rate
of only 102/minute. The accident and emergency team suspected a possible pulmonary
embolism (PE) and so a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed (Figures 46.1 and 46.2).

Axial CTPA image.

Figure 46.2 Reformatted coronal CTPA
image.

Question
• What do the CT images demonstrate?

133

ANSWER 46
Figures 46.1 and 46.2 demonstrate axial and reformatted coronal CTPA images respectively, showing a large filling defect within the distal right main pulmonary artery
extending into the upper lobe artery.
The initial chest radiograph in patients with pulmonary embolism is frequently normal.
An initially normal chest radiograph may over time begin to show atelectasis, which
can progress to cause a small pleural effusion and an elevated hemidiaphragm. After
24–72 hours, one third of patients with proven PE develop focal infiltrates that are
indistinguishable from an infectious pneumonia. Occasionally, there may be evidence of
Westermark sign, which is focal oligaemia (absence of blood vessel markings) beyond
the location of the pulmonary embolism and dilatation of those vessels proximally. A
rare late finding of pulmonary infarction is the Hampton hump, a triangular or rounded
pleural-based infiltrate with the apex pointed toward the hilum, frequently located adjacent to the diaphragm.
CTPA is the most common study used for detection of pulmonary embolism and has
become accepted both as the preferred primary diagnostic modality and as the standard
for making or excluding the diagnosis of PE. In the majority of patients, multi-detector
CT scans with intravenous contrast can resolve third-order pulmonary vessels.
It is important to note, however, that multi-detector CTPA carries a radiation dose and
can miss lesions in a patient with pleuritic chest pain due to multiple small emboli that
have lodged in distal vessels. In patients with a normal chest radiograph, nuclear scintigraphic ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scanning of the lung is an alternative diagnostic
modality for detecting PE with a lower radiation dose. This modality is recommended
only for patients with a normal chest radiograph in order to prevent spurious perfusion
mismatch from other lung processes.

KEY POINTS

• The initial chest radiograph in patients with PE is frequently normal.
• CTPA is the most common study used for detection of PE and has become accepted
•

134

both as the preferred primary diagnostic modality and as the standard for making or
excluding the diagnosis of PE.
It is important to note, however, that in patients with a normal chest radiograph,
ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scanning is an alternative modality carrying a lower
radiation dose.

CASE 47:

A NEW ARRIVAL WITH COUGH AND A FEVER

History
A 40-year-old man arrives in the United Kingdom from Bangladesh to visit relatives.
He has been complaining of feeling generally unwell with a cough and fever for around
3 weeks, which is worsening. He attends the accident and emergency department complaining of a productive cough and feels increasingly systemically unwell with fevers
and sweating. He has has been well previously with no smoking history or history of
exposure to dust.
Examination
His respiratory rate is 24 per minute and pulse 92 per minute. On respiratory examination
there is limited expansion with resonance to percussion, rather quiet breath sounds but
no bronchial breathing and no added sounds. He is febrile with a temperature of 40°C.
Oxygen saturation is 92 per cent breathing air. Full blood count shows a white cell count
of 20 × 103/mm3.
He is admitted to hospital under the care of the medical team but after a further 24 hours,
the intensive care team are asked to review the patient as his breathing and oxygenation
have deteriorated further. He is intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit where
central lines and a nasogastric tube are inserted. A chest radiograph is performed (Figure
47.1) and, based on this, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was requested
(Figure 47.2).

Figure 47.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 47.2 Axial CT image.

Questions
• Ignoring the bilateral internal jugular lines, what are the lung changes on the chest
radiograph in Figure 47.1?
• How would you describe the pattern of disease on CT (Figure 47.2)?

135

ANSWER 47
The initial chest radiograph (Figure 47.1) shows diffuse patchy consolidation on a background of widespread tiny nodules distributed throughout all lobes bilaterally. Subsequent
CT (Figure 47.2) confirms the presence of randomly distributed, diffuse tiny nodules and
bilateral large pleural effusions. Findings are suggestive of miliary tuberculosis.
Miliary tuberculosis (TB) is the widespread dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
via hematogenous spread. Classic miliary TB is defined as ‘millet like’ (approximately
2 mm) seeding of TB bacilli in the lung, as evidenced on chest radiography. This pattern
is seen in 1–3 per cent of all TB cases.
Following exposure and inhalation of TB bacilli in the lung, a primary pulmonary
complex is established, followed by development of pulmonary lymphangitis and hilar
lymphadenopathy. Mycobacteraemia and haematogenous seeding occur after the primary
infection. After initial inhalation of TB bacilli, miliary TB may occur as primary TB or
may develop years after the initial infection. The disseminated nodules consist of central
caseating necrosis and peripheral epithelioid and fibrous tissue.
Imaging findings may take weeks between the time of dissemination and the radiographic
appearance of disease. Up to 30 per cent have a normal chest radiograph. When first
visible, the nodules measure about 1 mm in size, but they can grow to 2–3 mm if left
untreated. High-resolution CT scans are more sensitive at demonstrating small nodules.
Nodules are either sharply or poorly defined and around 1–4 mm in size in a diffuse,
random distribution. There may be associated intra- and interlobular septal thickening.
Radiographically, nodules are not calcified, as opposed to the initial Ghon focus, which
is often visible on chest radiographs as a small calcified nodule. Chest CT scanning is
useful in the presence of suggestive and inconclusive chest radiography findings. When
treated, clearing is frequently rapid. Under the age of 5 years, there is an increased risk
of meningitis.
Risk factors include immunosuppression, cancer, transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, malnutrition, diabetes, silicosis and endstage renal disease.
KEY POINTS

• Miliary TB is caused by the widespread haematogenous dissemination of
•
•

136

Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is so named because the nodules are the size of millet
seeds (1–5 mm with a mean of 2 mm).
Miliary TB represents only approximately 1–3 per cent of all cases of TB.
It is considered to be a manifestation of primary TB, although clinical appearance of
miliary TB may not occur for many years after initial infection.

CASE 48:

A SEATBELT INJURY

History
A 33-year-old man was a passenger of car involved in a head-on collision travelling at
60 mph (97 km/h). He is brought into the accident and emergency department as a trauma
call. He was sitting in the rear of the car in the central passenger seat restrained by an
old-style ‘lap belt’, unlike the other passengers who were wearing standard shoulder and
lap belts. He was thrown forward into the seat in front. He was conscious throughout but
is complaining of severe pain in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.
Examination
Primary survey is unremarkable and his observations are stable. There is marked tenderness over the lower thoracic and lumbar spine. On neurological examination of the
lower limbs there are no motor or sensory abnormalities. Per rectal examination revealed
normal tone. A computed tomography (CT) examination of the thorax and abdomen was
obtained with sagittal (Figure 48.1a,b) and coronal (Figure 48.1c) reformats.

(a)

(b)

Question
• What abnormality do the CT images
show?

(c)
Figure 48.1 CT scans: (a,b) sagittal and (c)
coronal views.
137

ANSWER 48
The sagittal (Figure 48.1a,b) and coronal (Figure 48.1c) reformats of the spine show a
‘Chance’ fracture line extending through the spinous process, lamina, pedicles and vertebral body of T9 (a horizontal splitting of the vertebra beginning with the spinous process
or lamina and extending anteriorly through the pedicles and vertebral body).
Chance fracture is caused by a flexion injury of the spine, first described by G.Q. Chance
in 1948. It consists of a compression injury to the anterior portion of the vertebral body
and a transverse fracture through the posterior elements of the vertebra and the posterior
portion of the vertebral body. It is caused by violent forward flexion, causing distraction
injury to the posterior elements.
Chance fractures later became known as ‘seatbelt’ fractures with the advent of lap seatbelts in cars. A head-on collision would cause the passenger wearing a lap belt to suddenly be flexed at the waist, hence creating significant stress on the posterior elements of
the vertebra. From the 1980s when shoulder and lap belts became more common in cars
Chance fractures have become less associated with road traffic accidents and are more
commonly seen with falls or crush-type injuries where the thorax is acutely hyperflexed.
The most common site at which Chance fractures occur is the thoracolumbar junction and
mid-lumbar region in paediatric populations.
An anterior–posterior (AP) view of the spine may reveal disruption of the pedicles and
loss of vertebral body height. Frequently a transverse process fracture will be identified
on AP projection. The lateral view will demonstrate the spinous process fracture and fractures through the laminae and pedicles. The vertebral body will usually look compressed
and wedge shaped.
CT of the spine should be performed on all Chance fractures to assess the extent of the
fracture and to evaluate the spinal canal. Sagittal reconstructions of the axial images
provide a great deal of information about the fracture pattern. Posterior element fractures
are better seen on lateral projection, although the AP view helps to demonstrate pedicle
involvement.
Up to 50 per cent of Chance fractures have associated intra-abdominal injuries, including fractures of the pancreas, contusions or lacerations of the duodenum and mesenteric
contusions or lacerations.
KEY POINTS

• The incidence of associated intra-abdominal injuries with a Chance fracture reaches
•

138

50 per cent. Therefore, when a Chance fracture is diagnosed a CT of the abdomen
should be obtained.
Injuries associated with Chance fractures include fractures of the pancreas, duodenum
and mesentery contusions/rupture.

CASE 49:

A DEVICE IN THE PELVIS

History
A 30-year-old woman is admitted via the accident and emergency department with diffuse cramping abdominal pain. She has not opened her bowels for 4 days. She has a history of painful endometriosis and has been using increasing amounts of opiate analgesia
to control the pain.
Examination
Her observations are all within the normal range. Her haematology and biochemistry
results are also normal.
The abdomen is soft with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowels sounds are present
and normal. Per rectal exam demonstrates a rectum containing solid stool.
A plain radiograph of the abdomen was performed (Figure 49.1).

Figure 49.1 Plain radiograph of the abdomen.

Question
• What abnormalities can be seen in the abdomen radiograph?

139

ANSWER 49
The radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates faecal loading of the large bowel but no
significantly dilated loops (Figure 49.1) There is no evidence of free gas or pneumoperitoneum. Projected over the mid pelvis is an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) (arrow,
Figure 49.2). These are frequently seen as an incidental findings in radiographs of the
abdomen and pelvis. A piercing is also present.

Figure 49.2

The IUCD is a form of birth control. It is an object, placed in the uterus, to prevent
pregnancy. The aim of these devices is to confer long-term, reversible protection against
unwanted pregnancy. They may, however, induce menstrual complications as well as an
increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. They can also be
spontaneously expelled from the uterus without being noticed by the patient.
Among modern IUCDs, the two types available are copper-containing devices and a
hormone-containing device that releases a progestogen. Currently, there are several different kinds of copper IUCDs available in different parts of the world, and there is one
hormonal device, called Mirena®.
An IUCD can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion unless removed in cases where
intrauterine pregnancy occurs. Complications at the time of insertion include pain, syncope and uterine perforation.
In this case, however, the most likely cause of the patient’s abdominal pain is constipation due to opiate analgesia use and the IUCD is an incidental finding.
KEY POINTS

• Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) are a commonly used form of birth control
and are frequently seen as an incidental finding on radiographs.

140

CASE 50:

A CARDIAC ABNORMALITY

History
A 66-year-old woman is admitted to the accident and emergency department with sudden
onset of chest pain 1 hour earlier. She had otherwise been fit and well apart from a history of hypertension for which she had been treated with amlodipine for the last 11 years.
Examination
The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Troponin
was not raised. D-dimer was moderately elevated. A chest radiograph was performed
(Figure 50.1). The accident and emergency team were concerned about the possibility
of a pulmonary embolism and therefore a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram
(CTPA) was performed (one axial slice is shown in Figure 50.2). No pulmonary embolism
or focal lung parenchymal abnormality was seen.

Figure 50.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 50.2 Axial CTPA image.

Question
• What abnormalities do the chest radiograph in Figure 50.1 and axial enhanced CT
image (at the level of the heart) seen in Figure 50.2 demonstrate?

141

ANSWER 50
The chest radiograph (Figure 50.1) demonstrates that the heart is enlarged (there is cardiomegaly), shown by the fact that the cardiothoracic ratio is greater than 50 per cent
on the posterior–anterior (PA) view. The cardiothoracic ratio is the maximum transverse
diameter of the heart divided by the greatest internal diameter of the thoracic cage (from
inside of rib to inside of rib). This is again demonstrated on the CTPA (in Figure 50.2).
Cardiomegaly is often first detected on chest radiograph.
In normal people the cardiothoracic ratio is usually less than 50 per cent, measured by
taking the maximum transverse diameter of the heart on a PA film as a proportion of the
thoracic diameter at the same level. Therefore, the cardiothoracic ratio is a convenient
way of separating most normal hearts from most abnormal hearts. The heart size should
be assessed on every chest radiograph. On an AP film the cardiac size is magnified so
a ratio over 50 per cent may not indicate cardiac enlargement. If the heart is enlarged,
check for other signs of heart failure such as pulmonary oedema, septal (Kerley B) lines
and pleural effusions.
A multitude of conditions can give rise to cardiomegaly, which is thought to result
from the direct effect of the thickening of the heart muscles when the heart is given an
increased workload. Causative factors include heart valve disorders, high blood pressure,
severe anaemia, thyroid disorders, viral illnesses, drug abuse and previous heart attacks,
which can cause the heart to overwork. An increase in workload, however, may also be
caused by exercise.

KEY POINTS

• If there is cardiomegaly, look for other signs of heart failure.
• Cardiomegaly may be the first sign of an occult systemic or cardiovascular disease.

142

CASE 51:

A MIRROR IMAGE

History
A 41-year-old woman was transferred to high dependency unit (HDU) from the general
medical ward where her breathing had been steadily deteriorating. She had been admitted
with a short history of worsening dyspnoea and cough over 2 days. She had demonstrated
pyrexia and raised inflammatory markers and had been treated with high flow oxygen
and antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia but had continued to worsen. The patient was
too unwell to give a medical history but no significant previous medical history had been
noted by the admitting team.
Examination
On examination she is tachypnoic (30/minute) and there is bronchial breathing in both
mid zones with inspiratory crackles in the same areas. Air entry was reduced bilaterally.
On examination for the heart sounds it is noted that they cannot be appreciated in the
normal left praecordial position and the apex beat is also not palpable on the left. Instead
the apex beat is palpated and heart sounds are auscultated on the right of the praecordium. Palpation of the abdomen suggests a liver edge under the left costophrenic angle.

Question
• What condition do you think the patient may have?
• What variations are there?
• What do the chest radiograph (Figure 51.1) and the axial enhanced computed tomography (CT) image (Figure 51.2) show.

Figure 51.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 51.2 Axial enhanced CT image.

143

ANSWER 51
The chest radiograph in Figure 51.1 demonstrates that the heart is positioned within the
right side of the chest (dextrocardia). There is bilateral patchy consolidation within both
lungs, explaining the patient’s respiratory deterioration, and a nasogastric tube inserted
by the HDU team can be seen extending below the right hemithorax instead of the usual
left. The CT scan (Figure 51.2) confirms that the liver and spleen are in opposite positions
to normal, suggestive of situs inversus.
Situs inversus is present in approximately 0.01 per cent of the population. Also called
situs transversus or oppositus, it is a congenital condition in which the major visceral
organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. The term ‘situs inversus’ is a
short form of the Latin phrase situs inversus viscerum, meaning ‘inverted position of the
internal organs’. The normal arrangement is known as situs solitus. In other rare cases, in
a condition known as situs ambiguous or heterotaxy, situs cannot be determined.
In situs inversus, the morphologic right atrium is on the left and the morphologic left
atrium is on the right. The usual pulmonary anatomy is also reversed such that the left
lung has three lobes and the right lung has two. Furthermore, the liver and gallbladder
are located on the left, whereas the stomach and spleen are positioned on the right (as in
the CT shown in Figure 51.2). The remaining internal structures are also a mirror image
of the normal.
Isolated dextrocardia is also termed ‘situs solitus with dextrocardia’. The cardiac apex
points to the right but organs are otherwise in their usual positions. Situs inversus with
dextrocardia is also termed ‘situs inversus totalis’ because the heart position, in addition
to the atrial chambers and abdominal viscera, is a mirror image of the normal anatomy.
The classification of situs is independent of the cardiac apical position.
Approximately 20 per cent of patients with situs inversus have an underlying condition
known as primary ciliary dyskinesia. This is a dysfunction of the cilia, which manifests
during embryonic development. As normal cilia play a role in determining the position of
internal organs during development, these individuals have a higher chance of developing situs inversus and Kartagener’s syndrome, which is characterized by the triad of situs
inversus, chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis.
KEY POINTS

• Situs inversus is a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed
or mirrored from their normal positions.

• When situs cannot be determined, the patient has situs ambiguous or heterotaxy.
In these patients, the liver may be midline, the spleen multiple or absent, the atrial
morphology aberrant and the bowel malrotated. Frequently, normally unilateral
structures are duplicated or absent.

144

CASE 52:

A DISTENDED AND PAINFUL ABDOMEN

History
A 72-year-old woman presented to the accident and emergency department with increasing nausea, distension and crampy lower abdominal pain over the previous 2 weeks.
Over a similar time course there has been bright red blood mixed in with her stools and
a slight feeling of incomplete emptying after going to the toilet. There was no history of
vomiting. She was normally very independent and had not wanted to bother her general
practitioner (GP). However, the pain had become increasingly unbearable such that her
husband called an ambulance.
Examination
She looked pale and dehydrated although her observations were all normal apart from
mild postural hypotension. Her abdomen was distended, with generalized tenderness and
voluntary guarding. The bowel sounds were tinkling and upon per rectal examination
there was the impression of a hard mass. Full blood count revealed a mild microcytic
anaemia, with haemoglobin 9.8 g/dL. A plain radiograph of the abdomen was performed
in accident and emergency (Figure 52.1) and on the basis of this the surgical team
requested computed tomography (CT) imaging (Figures 52.2 and 52.3).

Figure 52.2 Axial CT scan.

Figure 52.1 Plain radiograph.

Question
• What does the plain radiograph demonstrate?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What do the axial CT images show?
Figure 52.3 Axial CT scan.
145

ANSWER 52
Figure 52.1 demonstrates multiple loops of dilated large bowel filling the abdomen consistent with a distal mechanical large bowel obstruction or pseudo-obstruction (note the
radiograph is suboptimal as the upper abdomen has been missed). Figure 52.2 shows an
axial contrast enhanced CT image on lung windows at the level of the adrenal glands
demonstrating multiple dilated loops of large bowel distending the abdomen. Figure 52.3
with soft tissue CT windows demonstrates a large obstructing, circumferential bulky rectal mass as the cause of the large bowel obstruction.
The most common causes of mechanical large bowel obstruction in this age of patient
would include colon cancer, diverticulitis or sigmoid volvulus. Less common causes
of large bowel obstruction include inflammatory bowel disease, hernias, adhesions or
endometriosis.
Approximately 25 per cent of all intestinal obstructions occur in the large bowel. Large
bowel obstruction is a common emergency condition that requires early identification and intervention and may result from either mechanical interruption of the flow
of intestinal contents or by the dilation of the colon in the absence of an anatomic
lesion (pseudo-obstruction). Distinguishing between a true mechanical obstruction and a
pseudo-obstruction is important as the treatment differs.
Radiologically, the large bowel is characterized on plain film by its haustrations and
sacculations, which are most prominent in the ascending and transverse colon but can
also be seen in the left colon. With moderate distention of the large bowel, the haustral
folds appear to extend entirely across the lumen but this appearance may disappear with
further distension. The haustral folds of the large bowel are more widely spaced than the
valvulae conniventes of the small bowel. The large bowel will normally contain solid
material, whereas small bowel usually contains liquid and gas only. Furthermore, large
bowel tends to be peripherally located, whereas the small bowel is centrally located.
The colon is dilated when it exceeds 6 cm in diameter, and the caecum is dilated when
it exceeds 9 cm. When the caecal diameter exceeds 10 cm the risk of perforation is high.
The caecum always dilates to the largest extent no matter the location of large bowel
obstruction.
Gas and faeces tend to accumulate proximal to the point of obstruction. In a typical
configuration of mechanical obstruction, all colonic segments proximal to the point of
luminal narrowing are dilated. In most cases of large bowel obstruction, the bowel will
contain variable amounts of solid, liquid and gaseous constituents. CT imaging frequently
identifies the cause of obstruction.

KEY POINTS

• Dilatation of the colon >6 cm is abnormal (as is caecal dilatation >9 cm).
• An abdominal radiograph may demonstrate the level of large bowel obstruction but
cannot reliably differentiate mechanical obstruction from pseudo-obstruction.

CASE 53:

BLOODY SPUTUM AND WEIGHT LOSS

History
A 74-year-old man with a 40-year history of smoking attends his general practitioner
(GP). He has been coughing up blood-stained sputum over the past 2 months and has
also noted some weight loss. Over the past 48 hours he has noticed increasing shortness
of breath and some discomfort in the left side of his chest.
Examination
A full blood count and urea and electrolytes are normal. He is referred for a chest radiograph (Figure 53.1) and, based on the results of the chest X-ray, he is referred to hospital
for a computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure 53.2).

Figure 53.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 53.2 Axial enhanced CT scan.

Questions
• What does the chest radiograph show?
• Why can you not see the left heart border?
• Is the left hilum of normal appearance?
• What does the CT scan show?

147

ANSWER 53
In the chest radiograph (Figure 53.1) there is diffuse haziness over the left hemithorax
which is caused by the collapse (atelectasis) of the left upper lobe which lies as a thin
curtain over the remaining inflated left lower lobe. There is a left hilar mass, which is
the likely cause for the lobar collapse. On the axial enhanced CT image (Figure 53.2) an
obstructing left hilar mass is seen along with an adjacent parenchymal mass.
It is important to be aware that the left upper lobe does not collapse in the same manner
as the right upper lobe. This is due to anatomy as there is no middle lobe on the left. The
equivalent of the right middle lobe on the left is the lingula segment of the left upper
lobe.
Plain film signs of left upper lobe collapse include: an area of increased opacity in the
left upper lobe with a poorly defined margin on posterior–anterior (PA) radiograph, the
left hilum may be elevated and an increase in lung density which may be almost imperceptible on the PA view. The aortic knob and upper left cardiac shadow may be obliterated and there may be a lucent stripe between the medial edge of the collapsed segment
and the aortic arch (where the lower lobe has been pulled up by the collapsed lung – the
Luftsichel sign). Unlike right upper lobe collapse, there is no sharply defined border and
the abnormal increase in lung density merges into the normal lung inferiorly.
Lobar collapse is divided physiologically into obstructive and non-obstructive causes.
Obstructive atelectasis is the most common form and results from reabsorption of gas
from the alveoli when communication between the alveoli and the trachea is obstructed.
The obstruction can occur at the level of the larger or smaller bronchus. Common causes
of obstructive atelectasis include foreign body, tumour and mucous plugging.
Non-obstructive atelectasis can be caused by loss of contact between the parietal and
visceral pleurae, compression, loss of surfactant and replacement of parenchymal tissue
by scarring or infiltrative disease.
Collapse and consolidation can occur independently or together. Collapse can be partial
or complete. Consolidation alone is not associated with a reduction in volume of the
affected lung. It is often not clear to what extent the appearance is due to collapse or
consolidation or both. If a lobe is only partially collapsed and there is no accompanying
consolidation, there may be no increase in opacity. In cases of pure collapse, only when
the collapse is virtually complete will there be a significant increase in density of the
affected lung.
KEY POINTS

• Left upper lobe collapse may be a subtle finding on chest radiograph.
• In the context of the clinical history, given this is highly suspicious for collapse
secondary to an obstructing bronchogenic malignancy further imaging with CT should
be performed for further evaluation.

CASE 54:

A SOFT FLUCTUANT LUMP

History
A 35-year-old man who is otherwise fit and well with no previous medical history attends
his general practitioner (GP) with an 18-month history of a soft swelling over his lumbar
spine. The lump has not changed in size over the last year. He has noticed it incidentally
and it has not been uncomfortable. No other lumps have been noted. He is concerned
regarding its aesthetic appearance and wants to get it checked.
Examination
On examination the lump was soft, fluctuant, not fixed to underlying tissues and there
was no overlying skin changes. It was a solitary lesion. There was no pulsatility. It did not
transilluminate. The GP suspected a benign lesion but wanted correlation with ultrasound
(Figures 54.1 and 54.2).

Figure 54.1 Ultrasound.

Figure 54.2 Ultrasound with colour Doppler.

Question
• What do you think is the most likely diagnosis?
• How would you describe the ultrasound findings?
149

ANSWER 54
Figure 54.1 is an ultrasound image demonstrating an ovoid hypoechoic subcutaneous
lesion parallel to the skin with no evidence of invasion into deeper structures. There are
septations seen internally. Sonographic features are consistent with a lipoma. The same
lesion with colour Doppler settings applied (Figure 54.2) shows that the lesion is avascular, consistent with a lipoma.
Lipomas are the most common benign mesenchymal tumour. These slow-growing, benign
fatty tumours form soft, lobulated masses enclosed by a thin, fibrous capsule. Although
it has been suggested that lipomas may rarely undergo sarcomatous (malignant) change,
this has never been convincingly proven. The majority of lipomas encountered by
clinicians are subcutaneous in location. Lipomas typically develop as discrete rubbery
masses in the subcutaneous tissues of the trunk and proximal extremities. Occasionally
they may be found in other locations, for example, intramuscular, retroperitoneal and
gastrointestinal.
Patients usually give a history of a slowly growing lesion present for years and usually do
not complain of pain or discomfort. Painful lipomas are the hallmark of a rare condition
called Dercum’s disease (adiposis dolorosa).
In the subcutaneous location, the primary differential diagnosis is a sebaceous cyst or an
abscess. Sebaceous cysts are also rounded and subcutaneous. They can be differentiated
from lipomas by their characteristic central punctum and the surrounding induration.
Treatment requires removal of a small ellipse of overlying skin to avoid entering the cyst.
Abscesses typically have overlying induration and erythema. In these cases, incision and
drainage is the appropriate management.
On ultrasound, subcutaneous lipomas are usually seen as well-defined, compressible,
elliptical masses with the longest diameter parallel to the skin surface. They demonstrate multiple echogenic lines parallel to the skin surface with no evidence of posterior
enhancement or attenuation and no flow on colour Doppler sonography (as seen in
Figure 54.2). Compared with adjacent muscle, most lipomas are hyperechoic (bright), but
some may be isoechoic or hypoechoic (dark).
CT scanning is principally indicated for distinguishing between lipomas and liposarcomas.
KEY POINTS

• Subcutaneous lipomas are common, slow-growing, benign soft tissue tumours.
• Sonographically they are usually seen as well-defined, avascular, compressible,
elliptical masses with the longest diameter parallel to the skin surface.

CASE 55:

ABDOMINAL DISTENSION AND SHIFTING DULLNESS

History
A 61-year-old man presents to hospital with generalized abdominal distension and bloating over the previous 3 weeks. This has become increasingly uncomfortable. He also notes
feeling tired and lethargic.
Examination
Upon examination his observations are all within normal limits. His chest is clear but the
abdomen is markedly distended. Upon percussing the abdomen there is dullness which
moves depending on the position of the patient (shifting dullness). Bowel sounds are
present but reduced. Rectal examination reveals an empty rectum.
His haemoglobin is reduced at 9.6 g/dL with evidence of a microcytic anaemia. Otherwise
his blood biochemisty, liver function test and inflammatory markers are normal.
An ultrasound was performed in the first instance (Figure 55.1) and on the basis of this
a computed tomography (CT) was done (Figure 55.2).

Figure 55.1 Ultrasound.

Figure 55.2 CT scan.

Questions
• What do the ultrasound image and the CT image demonstrate?
• What are the potential causes that could give rise to this?

151

ANSWER 55
The ultrasound image in Figure 55.1 demonstrates a large, anechoic (in other words, no
echoes or solid component) fluid collection within the abdomen. The edge of the liver is
seen in the bottom left of the image and collapsed loops of bowel are seen inferiorly and
to the right. The ultrasound image has been acquired with the probe held in a longitudinal
orientation in the subphrenic region.
The axial contrast enhanced CT image in Figure 55.2 confirms a large volume of fluid
around the inferior margin of the liver, the spleen and within the upper abdomen.
Ascites describes the condition of pathological collection of fluid within the abdominal
cavity and there is a wide differential of both transudative and exudative causes.
Uncomplicated (in other words non-infected, inflammatory or malignant) ascites appears
as a homogeneous, freely mobile, anechoic collection in the peritoneal cavity demonstrating acoustic enhancement. Free ascites does not displace organs but typically distributes
itself between them, conforming to organ margins.
Features suggesting complicated ascites include fine or coarse internal echoes, septation,
loculation or atypical fluid distribution, matting/clumping of bowel loops and thickening
of interfaces between the fluid and adjacent structures.
Traces of fluid usually collect in the posterior subhepatic space (Morrison’s pouch) and
around the liver as a sonolucent (dark on ultrasound) band. Fluid also often localizes in
the pouch of Douglas (recto-uterine pouch). Where there is a large volume of ascites, the
small bowel loops have a characteristic appearance on ultrasound as they hang from a
vertically floating mesentery.
Ascites is also usually demonstrated well on CT scanning. CT may also demonstrate the
aetiology including features suggestive of neoplasia such as hepatic, splenic or adrenal
lesions, lymphadenopathy or masses arising from the bowel, ovary or pancreas.
This patient was found to have a gastrointestinal stromal tumour as the cause of his
ascites.

KEY POINTS

• Ultrasound and CT are both sensitive to small volumes of ascites and may demonstrate
the aetiology.

CASE 56:

A PAINFUL HAND

History
A 55-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner (GP) with several weeks of
pain in the left hand. She remembers tripping in the garden and landing on her left outstretched hand previously but had not attended the accident and emergency department,
as she did not feel she had sustained a fracture.
She is otherwise fit and well. Her symptoms include pain (which she describes as ‘burning’ type), tenderness and swelling in the left hand.

Examination
On examination there is wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand associated with evidence of sweating, warmth and flushed, shiny skin. There was evidence of hyperaesthesia,
hyperalgesia and allodynia. There was no evidence of synovitis or deformity, however.
The GP decided to refer the patient to her local hospital for an X-ray (Figures 56.1a,b).

(b)
Figure 56.1 (a) Posterior–anterior (PA) and (b) oblique views.

Question
• What abnormality do you notice on these hand radiographs?

153

ANSWER 56
There is diffuse reduction in radiological bone density (increased radiolucency) in a predominantly periarticular distribution around the joints of the hand. There is, however, no
associated evidence of joint erosions or destruction and no focal destructive cortical bony
lesion or periosteal reaction is seen. Features are consistent with a regional periarticular
osteopaenia.
Osteopaenia refers to reduced bone mineral density and, radiologically, to increased
radiolucency of bone. The most common cause by far of osteopaenia is osteoporosis,
however, there are multiple aetiologies so the finding of radiolucent bone does not make
this an automatic diagnosis. One should search for other more specific clues to the exact
underlying disorder and more specific radiographic clues to their diagnosis.
Osteopaenia can be difficult to diagnose accurately on plain radiographs which are frequently insensitive to changes in bone mineral. Approximately 30–50 per cent of the
bone mass must be lost before it can be detected on a plain film.
Osteopaenia may be diffuse or regional and the differential diagnosis is broad and can
be vascular, drug-induced, toxic, endocrine/metabolic, congenital or idiopathic. Causes
of regional osteoporosis include immobilization with disuse and regional sympathetic
dystrophy syndrome (RSDS).
In the hand radiographs seen in Figures 56.1, the joint spaces are generally preserved
with no destructive changes. The history, examination and imaging features suggested
regional osteoporosis secondary to RSDS.
The exact mechanism of how RSDS develops is poorly understood. Theories include irritation and abnormal excitation of nervous tissue, leading to abnormal impulses along
nerves that affect blood vessels and skin. A variety of events can trigger the condition,
including trauma, surgery, heart disease, degenerative arthritis of the neck, stroke or
other brain diseases, nerve irritation by entrapment (such as carpal tunnel syndrome),
shoulder problems, breast cancer, and drugs for tuberculosis and barbiturates. The incidence after fractures and contusions ranges from 10 to 30 per cent. In this case the
patient had sustained trauma in the absence of a fracture. While some cases are associated with an identifiable nerve injury, many are not and there is no associated event in
a third of patients. The upper extremities are more likely to be involved than the lower.

KEY POINTS

• Osteopaenia refers to increased radiolucency of bone. The most common cause by far
of osteopaenia is osteoporosis.

• Osteopaenia can be diffuse or localized. Secondary clues should be sought to identify
the aetiology.

CASE 57:

A RETIRED CONSTRUCTION WORKER WITH A COUGH

History
A 65-year-old retired construction worker attends his general practitioner (GP) with a
cough. The cough was non-productive and he denied feeling significantly short of breath.
He also denied fevers and weight loss. He was a non-smoker and had been otherwise
well aside from taking a thiazide diuretic for hypertension, which was well controlled.
He had only a history of hernia repair and appendicectomy many years previously. In his
occupational history, he had retired from construction work aged 50 and had worked in
an administrative role for the last 15 years.
Examination
On examination he looked well. There was good air entry and chest expansion bilaterally,
breath sounds were vesicular and there were no added sounds.
A routine chest radiograph was performed (Figure 57.1). Upon reviewing the radiograph
the GP requested a computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax (Figure 57.2).

Figure 57.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 57.2 CT scan of thorax.

Questions
• What do the chest radiograph and the CT scan demonstrate?
• What may cause this appearance?

155

ANSWER 57
The chest radiograph in Figure 57.1 demonstrates multiple bilateral radio-opaque pleural
plaques consistent with previous exposure to asbestos. This is confirmed on CT in Figure
57.2 where calcified pleural plaques are seen along the diaphragmatic pleura.
Pleural plaques are deposits of hyalinized collagen fibres in the parietal pleura. They are
indicative of asbestos exposure and typically become visible after a latency period of
10–20 or more years after the inhalation of asbestos fibres. Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous silicate that was widely used in the past for a range of commercial applications including shipbuilding, construction, textile and insulation industries.
In addition to benign pleural plaques, however, there is also a spectrum of more significant
asbestos-related thoracic diseases including benign pleural effusion, diffuse pleural thickening, rounded atelectasis, asbestosis (i.e. lung fibrosis), mesothelioma and lung cancer. Plaques
may occur in isolation as in this case or in association with lung parenchymal disease.
Pleural plaques are usually multiple, bilateral and often relatively symmetrical and are
located in the mid portion of the chest wall between the seventh and tenth ribs, following
rib contours, or adjacent to the aponeurotic portion of the diaphragm (as seen on the CT).
Visceral pleura, lung apices and costophrenic angles are usually spared.
On chest radiographs, the prevalence of calcification in pleural plaques is reported to be around
15 per cent, however CT is far more sensitive with sensitivity around 50 per cent. In profile, calcified plaques appear as opaque lines that lie parallel to the chest wall, mediastinum, pericardium and diaphragm. Viewed en face, calcified plaques are seen as irregular and heterogeneous
densities. The presence of bilateral, superior diaphragmatic surface calcifications with spared
costophrenic angles is virtually pathognomonic for asbestos-related pleural disease. Isolated
plaques and diffuse pleural thickening may also seen in tuberculosis, trauma and haemothorax.
CT scanning is often used in the evaluation of pleural disease. Plaques appear as discrete,
well-defined areas of localized pleural thickening which are usually multiple, bilateral
and located adjacent to rigid structures, such as the ribs, mid portion of the chest, aponeurotic portion of the diaphragm, mediastinum and paravertebral regions. Lung apices
and costophrenic angles typically are spared. Rarely, the visceral pleura within fissures
may be involved, or plaques may be pedunculated.
CT scanning (in particular, high-resolution CT) allows demonstration of interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis, and may be helpful in diagnosing early stages of asbestosis. It also
is useful in delineation of pleural or pleura-based abnormalities (for example, effusion,
thickening, plaque, malignant mesothelioma, rounded atelectasis) and in evaluation of a
parenchymal density that is suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma.
In this case, the CT failed to show any further significant sequelae of asbestos exposure and the
patient recovered with a short course of antibiotics. In the absence of any other sign of asbestosrelated disease, isolated pleural plaques alone do not require further follow-up or investigation.
KEY POINTS

• Latency time for development of pleural plaques is usually around 20 years.
• Most patients who have asbestos-related pleural plaques are asymptomatic. The
•

156

chest radiograph plays an important role in detection of asbestos-related pleural and
parenchymal abnormalities and assessment of progression of disease.
High-resolution CT is superior to the radiograph in detection of pleural plaques and is
more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of asbestos-related pleural disease.

CASE 58:

DISTENDED ABDOMEN AND UNABLE TO PASS GAS

History
A 38-year-old man attends the accident and emergency department with a 48-hour
history of cramping abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. He felt his
abdomen was ‘blown up’ and mentioned no longer being able to pass flatus. He was also
sweating and thirsty.
Five years previously he had a prolonged admission following a perforated appendix for
which he had his appendix removed and an associated abscess drained. He had remained
well ever since, took no medications and had no allergies.

Examination
On examination his pulse was 104/minute, in sinus rhythm. His mucous membranes were
dry. His abdomen was distended. He complained of generalized tenderness but there was
no rebound or guarding. The bowel sounds were prominent and tympanic. Per rectal
exam demonstrated an empty rectum.
His blood results demonstrated normal inflammatory markers. His biochemistry revealed
a urea of 8.4 mmol/L but creatinine within the normal range.
An erect chest radiograph was performed which did not demonstrate any free subdiaphragmatic gas, but the abdominal radiograph (Figure 58.1) was abnormal. In light of
this and following surgical review, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed
(Figure 58.2).

Figure 58.1 Abdominal radiograph.

Figure 58.2 CT scan.

Questions
• What abnormality is seen on the plain abdominal radiograph (Figure 58.1)?
• What does the CT show (Figure 58.2)?
• What does the arrow point to?

157

ANSWER 58
The radiograph of the abdomen in Figure 58.1 demonstrates multiple abnormally distended
loops of small bowel. No surgical clips are seen. The large bowel is collapsed. It is possible
to determine that this is small bowel dilatation, by the central location, calibre and the
presence of valvulae conniventes (as opposed to the peripheral location, wider calibre and
haustral folds of the large bowel). There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum to suggest
perforation. The axial CT in Figure 58.2 confirms dilated loops of fluid-filled small bowel.
A small bowel obstruction is caused by a variety of pathologic processes but essentially
is due to mechanical obstruction to the passage of the bowel contents somewhere in the
small bowel. The bowel proximal to the point of obstruction dilates with swallowed air
and secreted fluid. Vomiting may release some of the proximal bowel contents and reduce
the amount of proximal dilation. Bowel distal to the point of obstruction (i.e. colon and
distal small bowel) empties and collapses over time
The leading cause in developed countries is postoperative adhesions (60 per cent).
Postoperative adhesions can be the cause of acute obstruction within weeks of surgery or
present as chronic obstruction years later as in this case.
The second most common identified cause of small bowel obstruction is an incarcerated groin
hernia. Other aetiologies include malignant tumor (20 per cent), other hernias (10 per cent),
inflammatory bowel disease (5 per cent), volvulus (3 per cent) and other causes (2 per cent).
Small bowel obstructions can be partial or complete. They may also be simple or strangulated. Strangulated obstructions are surgical emergencies. If not diagnosed and properly
treated, vascular compromise can lead to bowel ischaemia, morbidity and mortality.
Plain radiographs are the primary imaging modality with the sensitivity reported as
approximately 75 per cent. Assessment should be made for surgical clips (which may
suggest adhesions as a cause), the hernial orifices (for incarcerated hernia) or aerobilia/
calcific densities (possible gallstone ileus). Small bowel dilatation greater than 2.5–3 cm
(especially if there is evidence of air–fluid levels) indicates small bowel obstruction.
CT scanning is useful in distinguishing extrinsic causes, for example adhesions and hernias,
from intrinsic causes, such as neoplasms or Crohn’s disease. A transition point may be identified localizing any focal adhesions, as seen on the axial CT image in Figure 58.2 (arrow),
which cannot be appreciated on plain films. The patient in this case probably developed
adhesions as a consequence of the surgery for his perforated appendix and abscess drainage.
CT should be considered where the patient has fever, tachycardia and localized abdominal pain with raised inflammatory markers. CT may demonstrate abscesses, inflammatory processes, extraluminal pathology resulting in obstruction, tumours or mesenteric
ischaemia. It also allows discrimination between ileus and mechanical small bowel in
postoperative patients.

modality and assessment should be made for surgical clips (which may suggest

between ileus and mechanical small bowel in postoperative patients.

CASE 59:

TORRENTIAL HAEMATEMESIS

History
A 52-year-old man with a history of alcoholism and hepatitis C is admitted to intensive
care with torrential haematemesis. He requires the transfusion of 10 units of blood, clotting factor and platelets over 36 hours. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals large
clots seen within the stomach with an associated bleeding point as a result of varices.
Examination
The patient is tachycardic with a pulse rate of 108/minute and tachypnoeic at 22/minute.
His blood pressure has been maintained within normal limits with replacement of blood
and colloids. Despite best efforts, however, the endoscopist is unable to halt the gastric
bleeding and a computed tomography (CT) scan is therefore performed to assess for any
potential point of arterial embolization (Figure 59.1a,b).

(a)

(b)

Figure 59.1 Two axial contrast-enhanced CT images.

Question
• What abnormalities do the two axial contrast-enhanced CT images in Figure 59.1a,b
demonstrate?

159

ANSWER 59
The axial contrast-enhanced CT images in Figure 59.1 are taken at two levels through the
upper abdomen and demonstrate the presence of enhancing serpigenous veins adjacent to
the stomach consistent with gastric varices as a consequence of liver cirrhosis (irregular
liver contour, patchy low attenuation and enhancement) and portal venous thrombosis
(filling defect within the portal vein), which are also seen.
Gastric varices are dilated submucosal veins in the stomach, which are most frequently
found in patients with portal hypertension and resulting elevated portal venous pressure, which may be a complication of cirrhosis. In this example, the portal vein itself is
thrombosed.
Gastric variceal bleeding is often profuse, has a high rate of recurrence and is associated
with decreased survival. Bleeding varices represent a potentially life-threatening cause
of haematemesis.
In the setting of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, gastric varices are usually associated
with oesophageal varices. Isolated gastric varices may also be found in patients with
splenic venous thrombosis as blood is shunted via the short gastric veins, which drain
the fundus of the stomach flow. For example, this may be a complication of acute pancreatitis or pancreatic malignancy.
Patients with bleeding gastric varices in addition to presenting with haematemesis, may
exhibit melaena or frank rectal bleeding. The bleeding may be brisk, and patients may
soon develop haemorrhagic shock, with this patient clinically demonstrating features of
grade 2 shock.
Gastric varices are seen on CT (Figure 59.1) as characteristically multiple lobulated, serpentine masses. It is possible for varices to present as a polypoid mass in the fundus.
They may also be seen on ultrasound of the upper abdomen or on upper gastrointestinal
barium series (although they may be obscured by overlying gastric rugae).
On this occasion, no focal bleeding point was identified as suitable for embolization.

KEY POINTS

• CT or ultrasound may demonstrate evidence of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and
ascites in addition to the varices themselves.

CASE 60:

AN INCIDENTAL FINDING ON CHEST RADIOGRAPH

History
A previously fit and well 16-year-old boy attends his general practitioner (GP) with a
2-week history of a cough. He noted a small amount of clear sputum but the cough had
been generally non-productive and there had been no blood expectorated. He had noted
feeling generally feverish. He had been previously fit and well.
Examination
On examination he demonstrates evidence of an upper tract respiratory infection. He was
afebrile, with a respiratory rate of 20/minute and a heart rate of 80/minute. On respiratory
examination there is equal lung expansion with good air entry bilaterally. Breath sounds
were vesicular with no added sounds. Investigations showed a normal white cell count
and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein of 20 mg/L. Blood biochemistry was normal.
The GP referred him to his local hospital for a chest radiograph (Figures 60.1 and 60.2).

Figure 60.1 Chest radiograph

Figure 60.2 Chest radiograph

Questions
• What do you observe about the chest radiograph (Figure 60.1)?
• What do the arrows identify (Figure 60.2)?
• What is the significance of this finding?

161

ANSWER 60
Figure 60.1 shows a normal heart size and mediastinal contour with no focal collapse,
consolidation or active pulmonary lesion. The pleural spaces are clear. Incidental note is
made of an azygos fissure.
The arrows in Figure 60.2 identify an azygos fissure (azygos lobe), which is a small accessory lobe sometimes found on the upper part of the right lung, separated from the rest of
the upper lobe by a deep groove lodging the azygos vein, of little clinical significance.
The azygos lobe appears commencing in a ‘teardrop’ shape approximately at around the
level of T5 to the right of the midline as a pale line curving outward and upward, then
back in to meet the root of the neck. The line is the infolding of the pleura.
Abnormal fissures and lobes of the lungs are common and usually insignificant. A lobe
related to the azygos vein appears in the right lung in about 1–2 per cent of people. It
develops when the apical bronchus grows superiorly and medial to the arch of the azygos
vein (instead of lateral to it). As a consequence, the azygos vein comes to lie at the bottom
of a deep fissure in the superior lobe of the right lung.
In this patient, no focal active lung pathology was identified. Incidental note was made
of the azygos lobe. No further investigation or treatment is required.

KEY POINTS

• An azygos lobe is frequently an incidental finding on chest radiograph and usually has
no clinical significance.

CASE 61:

A WORRIED NURSE IN INTENSIVE CARE

History
A 64-year-old man is admitted to intensive care following a coronary artery bypass graft
and aortic valve replacement. The procedure was uncomplicated, but post-operatively he
is slow to regain his appetite and a nasogastric tube is placed on intensive care for enteral
feeding. The nurse uses litmus paper to test the acidity of the aspirates and is concerned.
Simultaneously, the patient shortly afterwards begins to become dyspnoeic and is making
gagging reflexes.
Examination
His saturations drop to 82–86 per cent on 8L of oxygen. His blood pressure and heart rate
remain within normal limits. A chest radiograph is performed urgently (Figure 61.1).

Figure 61.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What abnormality do you note on the chest radiograph in Figure 61.1?
• What other findings are there on the image?
• What has changed in Figure 61.2?
• What abnormality does Figure 61.3 show (taken from a different paediatric patient)?

Figure 61.2 Later chest radiograph.

Figure 61.3 Chest radiograph from a different
(paediatric) patient.
163

ANSWER 61
The chest radiograph in Figure 61.1 shows that the nasogastric (NG) tube has been passed
down the left main bronchus. This is unusual as the (less acute) angle of the right main
bronchus is usually more favourable. There is a right internal jugular catheter which
is appropriately placed with its tip projected over the superior vena cava/right atrium.
A left intercostal chest drain is seen. Sternal wires are noted. Figure 61.2 demonstrates
the appropriately repositioned NG tube extending below the diaphragm. Figure 61.3
demonstrates an NG tube in a different (paediatric) patient, which lies within the distal
oesophagus and should be advanced into the stomach.
Chest radiographs for NG tube position are common. The NG tube is usually inserted
either for providing enteral nutrition, administration of drugs or for gastric drainage.
Nasogastric feeding is a common practice in all age groups. There is a risk that the NG
feeding tube can be misplaced into the lungs during insertion (as in Figure 61.1) or may
move out of the stomach at a later stage (Figure 61.3).
In the past, various methods have been used to determine the position of NG feeding
tubes. These included:
•
•
•
•

auscultation of air insufflated through the feeding tube (listening for a ‘whoosh’);
testing acidity or alkalinity of the aspirate using litmus paper;
looking for bubbling at the end of the NG tube;
the appearance of the feeding tube aspirate.

Current recommendations, however, suggest that these measures are not reliable and
therefore should not be used to detect the position of NG tubes.
The position of the tip of the NGT is assessed frequently in the first instance by drawing
back gastric contents and testing with pH paper. If there is any concern then radiographic
confirmation of NG tube position is performed.
Indeed current guidelines suggest:
• measuring the pH of the aspirate using pH indicator strips;
• use of radiography.
The most accurate method for confirming the correct position of an NG feeding tube is
radiography. The aim of radiography is to positively confirm that the NG tube is within
the gastrointestinal tract (within the stomach).
Sometimes longer nasojejunal (NJ) tubes are used. The objective is to place the tip of the
tube past the pylorus, through the duodenum and beyond the duodenal–jejunal flexure
into the jejunum. In doing so, this bypasses the regulatory function of the pylorus and
delivers nutrition or therapeutic agents directly into the jejunum.
The importance of establishing the position of the NG tube cannot be understated. A
patient who is fed or administered drugs via a malpositioned NG tube, such as that in
Figure 61.1, can deteriorate significantly and it may even lead to iatrogenic death.
KEY POINTS

• Current guidelines for appropriate placement of NG tubes include measuring the pH of
the aspirate using pH indicator strips and use of chest radiography to ensure the tip of
the tube is sited appropriately.

CASE 62:

YOUNG MAN WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
A 24-year-old man presents to the accident and emergency department with vomiting
and abdominal pain that has been worsening over the last 24 hours. He describes initially
feeling unwell with mild fever and central abdominal discomfort that has slowly focused
into the right iliac fossa. He has not been exposed to other people with similar symptoms
and although he has bought and eaten freshly prepared food, none of his friends have
has similar symptoms. He has no significant medical history.
Examination
His temperature is 37.8°C but his observations are otherwise normal. His chest and heart
sounds are normal. On abdominal examination there is mild distension and tenderness
over the right iliac fossa but no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are reduced.
You arrange an abdominal radiograph (Figure 62.1) and an ultrasound (Figure 62.2),
among other tests.

Figure 62.1 Abdominal radiograph.

Figure 62.2 Ultrasound image of the right
iliac fossa.

Questions
• What do the investigations show?
• What differential diagnoses could give these appearances?
• What else would you like to know?
• Would you do more imaging?
165

ANSWER 62
The abdominal radiograph (Figure 62.1) shows dilated lucent loops of small bowel, likely
to be partially gas filled in the upper abdomen. The distal small bowel is not seen, probably fluid filled and no comment about dilatation can be made. The large bowel gas pattern is not abnormal. The appearance could indicate a small bowel ileus or obstruction,
although a transition point to indicate a mechanical obstruction is not seen.
The ultrasound of the right iliac fossa (Figure 62.2) shows a tubular structure measuring
1.3 cm containing a calcification that blocks the ultrasound beam and casts a shadow
that may represent a dilated appendix (>6 mm diameter). The upper abdomen is normal.
The bladder appears normal. No significant free fluid is seen.
The differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, mesenteric adenitis (usually children),
gastroenteritis, Crohn’s disease, urinary tract infection and, in women, ovulation pain,
ovarian cyst haemorrhage, torsion, ectopic pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease.
Appendicitis seems the most likely diagnosis, however tests should include urinalysis. In
women, a pregnancy test should be done and it can be difficult to entirely rule out ovarian causes or pelvic inflammatory disease and a transvaginal ultrasound may be helpful
although may not be acceptable in younger females. The diagnosis may end up being
primarily clinical although a computed tomography (CT) may be done (as in this case due
to the dilated small bowel) if it is considered that the additional information justifies the
X-ray dose (Figure 62.3).
Appendicitis with small bowel dilatation is associated with a higher incidence of perforation of the appendix.

large appendicolith (present in 25 per cent on CT) within the dilated appendix (white arrows)

KEY POINTS

• Ultrasound may occasionally diagnose appendicitis but may struggle to rule out many
of the differential diagnoses.

• Ultrasound may be useful where there is reasonably high suspicion for appendicitis in
children and young women where a CT scan may be avoided.

CASE 63:

SKIN PLAQUES AND ACHY HANDS

History
A 41-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient rheumatology clinic complaining of
painful joints. The symptoms have been longstanding for 4 months and intermittently
cause an achy pain in the finger joints of both hands. This is sometimes associated with
joint swelling and causes stiffness, which is constant and not worse at any particular time
of the day. She denies any stigmata of infection, weight loss or rash.
Approximately 5 years ago she was diagnosed with psoriasis for which she takes topical
coal tar which controls her skin plaques well. She has no other relevant past medical
history and does not take any other regular medication. She finds her job as a nursery
school teacher very rewarding, but is finding her fine motor skill inhibited by joint
stiffness when trying to help the children in arts and crafts lessons. She is a smoker of
approximately 10 per week and drinks at weekends only. She is unmarried but lives with
her boyfriend.
Examination reveals mildly swollen proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally, which are
tender and have slightly limited range of movement. Bloods are taken and a radiograph
of both hands is ordered (Figure 63.1).

Figure 63.1 Anterior–posterior (AP) radiograph of both hands.

Questions
• What does the radiograph demonstrate?
• What is the main differential for these appearances?
• What are the extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis?

167

ANSWER 63
Figure 63.1 is an AP radiograph of both hands in an adult female patient. Soft tissue swelling
is seen involving the proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPJs). There is a symmetrical distal
small joint polyarthropathy. This predominantly involves the second, third and fourth PIPJs
of both hands with less marked involvement of the first interphalangeal joints and the distal
interphalangeal joints (DIPJs). The involved joints demonstrate loss of normal cartilage and
reduced joint space with marginal juxta-articular erosions. These are poorly demarcated and
partially obscured with overlying new bone formation, suggesting periostitis, and are termed
‘proliferative erosions’. The PIPJ articular surfaces are irregular, but there is no subperiosteal
osteoporosis or articular erosive changes seen to suggest a ‘pencil in cup’ appearance.
Bone density is preserved throughout and there is no bony ankylosis. The metacarpophalangeal joints are preserved, but there is mild radiocarpal and carpometacarpal joint
space narrowing in keeping with degenerative change. These appearances are characteristic of a seronegative spondyloarthropathy most likely related to psoriasis, however a
diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis needs to be excluded.
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, which can affect people at any age.
It is characterized by the presence of red skin plaques that are raised from the skin and
is often capped by silvery scales, associated with nail changes. It has a predilection for
extensor sites and is most commonly identified at the elbow and knee joints. There are
well-documented extracutaneous manifestations with arthropathy affecting 5 per cent
of psoriatic suffers and sometimes preceding the skin plaques by many years. There five
radiological subtypes of psoriatic arthropathy:1,2
•
•
•
•
•

symmetrical polyarthritis of the interphalangeal joints;
seronegative polyarthritis mimicking rheumatoid arthritis;
monoarthritis or asymmetrical oligoarthritis;
spondyloarthritis mimicking ankylosing spondylitis;
arthritis mutilans – a severe form of arthritis with marked deformity and joint destruction.

In contrast, Figure 63.2 is a characteristic plain radiograph of both hands in a patient
with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis. There is marked erosive change and fusion

arthritis.
168

related to the carpal bones bilaterally with erosive changes also seen related to the distal
radius and ulna. Bone density is generally reduced and there is bony ankylosis of the
carpometacarpal joints. The PIPJs and DIPJs are preserved throughout.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an immunologically mediated multisystem collagen vascular disease of unknown aetiology. Treatment in the acute setting of joint involvement is similar
to that of psoriasis, but long-term treatment is complicated, often involving a delicate
balance of disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) requiring regular clinical follow-up and
blood tests. Being a multisystem disorder, rheumatoid arthritis can affect the patient in
many ways outside of joint involvement. These include:
• systemic illness – fever, malaise and weight loss;
• vasculitis – predominantly affecting small vessels, the disease can mimic polyarteritis
nodosa causing peripheral neuropathy;
• skin nodules – firm and tender skin nodules occur along tendon sheaths;
• respiratory disorders – lung nodularity with cavitation can be seen, with concomitant
pulmonary fibrosis and pleural effusion;
• cardiovascular disorders – pericarditis, pericardial effusion and myositis are recognized;
• Felty’s syndrome – massive splenomegaly, often with neutropenia.

KEY POINTS

• Joint disease can precede the cutaneous manifestations of psoriasis by several years.
• Classically, psoriasis is associated with a symmetrical distal polyarthropathy of the
interphalangeal joints.

CASE 64:

TEACHING SPORT CAN BE A HEADACHE AT TIMES

History
A 38-year-old sports teacher was brought to the accident and emergency department by
ambulance. He had been found unconscious in his office by another member of staff at
the end of the afternoon. There was no sign of assault and the accompanying member
of staff remembers seeing the sports teacher at lunch where they laughed together at
something that had occurred that morning.
The sports teacher had taken his first class to the cricket nets for catching and batting
practice. During the session a batsman had driven the ball hard, accidentally hitting the
teacher on the left side of the head. Pupils near by heard a ‘crack’ but the sports teacher
did not lose consciousness and carried on with the lesson. He did report at lunchtime
feeling a little drowsy but had only administrative duties in the afternoon. On her way
home, another teacher checked on the sports teacher to find him unrousable in his office
and she raised the alarm.

Examination
Ambulance paramedics urgently brought the sports teacher to the accident and emergency department. Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) on arrival was 7 (motor 4, eyes 2,
speech 1). He had been intubated in the resuscitation room to protect his airway, and
a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed before admission to intensive
care (Figure 64.1).

Figure 64.1 Axial cranial CT scan.

Questions
• What are the CT scan findings?
• What is the diagnosis?

171

ANSWER 64
Figure 64.1 shows a single slice of a cranial CT scan taken at the level of the caudate heads.
There is asymmetry demonstrated with an area of increased density on the left side lying
underneath the left temporal bone. This abnormality is more dense than adjacent brain parenchyma, but less dense than the skull bones in keeping with acute blood. It has a biconvex
elliptical shape and is homogeneous in appearance. This collection of blood exerts mass effect
on adjacent brain parenchyma with total effacement of the adjacent lateral ventricle and loss
of normal left cerebral sulci. There is midline shift to the right of approximately 3 mm. The
quadrageminal cistern is effaced but the right lateral ventricle remains of expected size.
The same image rewindowed to emphasize bony pathology (Figure 64.2) demonstrates a vertical fracture of the left temporal bone (arrow). There is some subcutaneous soft tissue thickening at this site, which corresponds to the site of impact of the cricket ball. This represents
an acute extradural haemorrhage with mass effect compressing the brain within the skull.
Extradural haemorrhage is defined as
a collection of blood within the space
between the inner table of the skull and the
dura mater of the meninges. Blood collects
in the extradural space running along the
inside of the skull. It is strongly associated with direct head trauma and skull
fracture, with bony fragments lacerating
the meningeal vessels (commonly middle
meningeal). Depending on whether the lacerated vessels are arteries or veins, the rate
of haematoma expansion dictates whether
the patient presents hours or days after the
incident. Common symptoms are of gradually increasing drowsiness, which can
progress to coma as the haematoma has
focal mass effect compressing the brain
within the tight skull. Some patients can
demonstrate a third nerve palsy or hemiparesis as a sign of cerebral herniation.

Figure 64.2 CT scan rewindowed to
emphasize bony pathology.

An unenhanced cranial CT usually demonstrates an acute hyperdense collection of blood,
but if a few days old, can have varied attenuation appearances. It is differentiated from other
extra-axial collections by its shape. The expanding haematoma will have a biconvex elliptical shape as tracking blood is limited by the tethered cranial sutures. There may be a degree
of mass effect, and image review with bone windows has a high sensitivity for resolving
the underlying skull fracture. All patients will require urgent neurosurgical discussion and
neurologically compromised patients will require urgent decompression and evacuation.
KEY POINTS

• In an extradural haemorrhage, blood collects between the inner table of the skull and
the dura mater.

• It classically presents with reduced conscious level several hours after a traumatic incident.
• A characteristic concave elliptical haematoma is seen on CT with tracking blood
limited by cranial sutures.

CASE 65:

A CHESTY INFANT

History
A 3-month-old boy was referred to the paediatric department by his general practitioner
(GP) with respiratory problems. He has had a cough and runny nose for 2 days and has
become progressively more chesty. He now has problems feeding, at least one episode of
vomiting that may be cough related and dry nappies. Older siblings in the family also
have coryzal symptoms. The patient was born 2 weeks prematurely with no significant
neonatal problems. The mother is on treatment for asthma and there is no other significant medical or family history.
Examination
The initial examination showed a febrile infant with copious nasal secretions, conjunctivitis and noisy breathing (grunting and wheezing). There is tachypnoea (58 breaths per
minute) with intercostal and subcostal retraction. On listening to the chest there are fine
crackles and wheeze throughout. The rest of the examination is normal.
Over the next 24 hours, the patient did not improve on standard treatment and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and eventually required intubation. At this point a
chest radiograph (Figure 65.1) was done to check the lungs and position of the tube (an
earlier radiograph had been unremarkable).
Six hours later, problems with ventilation developed and a further radiograph was done
(Figure 65.2).

Figure 65.1 Anterior–posterior (AP)
radiograph.

Figure 65.2 Later radiograph.

Questions
• What differentials are you considering?
• What does the first radiograph show?
• What complication has developed in the second radiograph and why?
173

ANSWER 65
Given the age and presentation, the most likely diagnosis is bronchiolitis although pneumonia and aspiration should also be considered. Undiagnosed congenital cardiac or lung
disease and foreign body may need to be ruled out.
The first radiograph (Figure 65.1) shows hyperinflation with flattened diaphragm. The
lung volumes are large due to air trapping rather than fortuitous timing of the radiograph. Coarsened lung markings that reflect patchy airspace and interstitial infiltrates are
seen. There is also some thickening of the perihilar bronchial walls (cuffing). No focal
consolidation, cardiac abnormality or foreign body is seen. The appearance is consistent
with severe bronchiolitis, although similar appearances are also seen in atypical pneumonia and aspiration. The tip of the endotracheal (ET) tube is well above the carina and
the tip of the nasogastric (NG) tube is below the diaphragm.
The second radiograph (Figure 65.2) shows a low ET tube in the right main bronchus resulting in left lung occlusion and collapse. Some compensatory hyperexpansion of the right lung
across the midline is seen. The problem is remedied by withdrawing the tube tip (ideally to
the level of the clavicles). Remember to comment on tubes and complications on every image.
The most common complication is bacterial coinfection. This was suspected in this
patient’s case and shown on a subsequent
radiograph (Figure 65.3) that also showed
re-expansion of the left lung.
Bronchiolitis is usually diagnosed clinically and a chest radiograph is only needed
if the course of the illness is atypical or
to rule out other causes or complications.
The small airways become infected, resulting in narrowing and obstruction. The
most common cause is the respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and occasionally
adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses. This
may be confirmed by a nasopharyngeal
aspirate. The illness can usually be manFigure 65.3 Follow-up radiograph.
aged at home, but 2–3 per cent of cases
require admission to hospital of which
3–7 per cent require ventilation. Children
with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, infants with a history of gestational age less
than 34 weeks, infants younger than 6 weeks, and infants with congenital or acquired
immunodeficiency are at high risk for severe RSV infection.

KEY POINTS

• Bronchiolitis is largely diagnosed and managed without imaging.
• A chest radiograph is helpful to check for other causes and complications.
• The radiograph appearance of bronchiolitis is non-specific and may consist of
hyperexpanded lungs only, although patchy infiltrates may also be seen.

CASE 66:

DIFFICULTY IN SWALLOWING

History
A 47-year-old mother has been referred for a barium swallow study by her general practitioner (GP). She complains of increasing discomfort when eating and finds that food
sometimes gets stuck in her throat. This is more often the case when eating meat or bread,
and she finds that if she does not chew her food carefully, then each mouthful needs to
be washed down with a glass of water. She has recently taken to eating soup for most
meals, and does not find this too much of a problem. These symptoms have been getting
very gradually worse over the past 5 months, and despite her change in diet she denies
any significant weight loss.
There is no relevant past medical history, but her GP has recently prescribed iron tablets
following a blood test for feelings of increasing lethargy. She attributes this to her heavy
periods. She is a non-smoker and only drinks socially.

Examination
Her barium swallow study results are shown in Figure 66.1.

Figure 66.1 Barium swallow image.

Questions
• What does this view from the barium swallow show?
• What is the likely diagnosis?

175

ANSWER 66
For a barium swallow study, the patient is positioned between a fluoroscopy machine
containing an X-ray tube and an image intensifier. This provides a real-time image that
can be collimated to emphasize organs of the patient’s neck and chest. The patient is
asked to drink a contrast agent (e.g. barium) and hold it in the mouth. In coordination
with the radiologist, asking the patient to swallow on command allows for good opacification of the oesophagus and direct real-time observation of the passage the contrast
takes. Although many fluoroscopy studies are rarely used these days (e.g. barium enemas), swallow studies using barium or iodinated contrast medium are the ‘workhorse’ of
foregut imaging. As a relatively non-invasive technique, it allows for accurate visualization of the oesophageal diameter and mucosa, and is often used to confirm the presence
of persistent oesophageal leaks post-operatively.
This single lateral image is centred on the hypopharynx and upper oesophagus. Contrast
passes freely from the mouth to the mid-oesophagus with no evidence of hold-up or
obstruction. There is no evidence of aspiration. Within the proximal oesophagus at the
level of C5, there is an anterior ‘shelf-like’ filling defect seen. This arises at right angles
to the anterior oesophageal wall and appears to encroach into the oesophageal canal by
approximately one-third. There is no transition delay of contrast, and no evidence of
prestenotic dilatation or oesophageal diverticulosis. These features are in keeping with
an oesophageal web.
Oesophageal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophageal squamous tissue that grow
out from the anterior mucosal wall. Measuring approximately 1–2 mm in thickness, they
can cause complete or incomplete circumferential narrowing of the oesophageal lumen
and are most commonly seen in middle-aged white women. Symptoms are dependent on
the degree of obstruction, with patients complaining of dysphagia for solids rather than
liquids. Often found incidentally when patients present with feelings of globus or suffering food bolus impaction, symptoms can also include pain (odynophagia).
The aetiology of oesophageal webs is uncertain but can be both congenital, or more
commonly, acquired. They are associated with chronic inflammatory conditions of the
oesophagus including epidermolysis bullosa, pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid, and
are also seen in coeliac and graft-versus-host disease. There is a strong association with
Plummer–Vinson syndrome (PVS), in which patients experience concomitant glossitis,
angular stomatitis and iron-deficiency anaemia. Image findings should always be correlated with a full blood count to exclude this.
Treatment of oesophageal webs is routinely performed with balloon dilatation, and is
often a common byproduct of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy by bougienage. There is
an increased association with oesophageal cancer, and recurrence of symptoms should
be investigated early.
KEY POINTS

• A barium swallow investigation is recommended for assessment of dysphagia.
• Oesophageal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophageal squamous tissue that
grow out from the anterior mucosal wall.

• There is a strong correlation between oesophageal webs and other chronic
inflammatory conditions.

CASE 67:

PREGNANT WOMAN WITH VOMITING

History
A 24-year-old pregnant woman with hyperemesis presents to the accident and emergency
department with chest pain and swelling around the neck after 3 days of worsening
vomiting. She is dehydrated and breathless. She is in the 10th week of a confirmed intrauterine twin pregnancy and has already attended the early pregnancy unit for treatment
for vomiting. There has been no per vaginal (PV) bleeding or abnormal discharge. None of
her close contacts have similar symptoms. Her medical history is otherwise unremarkable.
Examination
She appears dehydrated and mildly agitated but otherwise fit. Swelling over the lower
neck and upper chest is noted that on palpation causes crepitus. She has mild tachycardia
but no pyrexia. More crepitus is heard over the lungs. The heart sounds are normal. The
abdomen is soft and mildly diffusely tender.
You arrange a chest radiograph (Figure 67.1) and blood tests.

Figure 67.1 Posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the X-ray show?
• What imaging would you do next?
• What about the pregnancy?

177

ANSWER 67
The chest radiograph shows free gas within the upper mediastinum (i.e. a pneumomediastinum outlining the aorta and the trachea). There is also subcutaneous free gas (i.e.
surgical emphysema), extending from the neck down over the upper thorax. No pneumothorax is seen. The lungs and heart appear normal.
Pneumomediastinum can be difficult to see on chest X-rays and is often missed if small.
The characteristic appearances are streaky lucencies in the mediastinum, gas outlining structures such as vessels, pulmonary ligament and producing lucency between the
hemidiaphragms. There may be associated pneumothoraces, pleural effusions, pneumopericardium or subcutaneous emphysema.
In terms of causes, it is useful to consider where the gas has come from. If it is intrathoracic, it could be from:
• oesophagus perforation secondary to foreign body, tumour or persistent vomiting
(Boerhaave’s syndrome);
• trachea or major bronchi – usually the result of blunt chest trauma, pneumothorax or
tumours;
• lungs – due to alveolar rupture secondary to asthma in children, lung disease, ventilation or inhaled recreational drugs;
• pleural space – pneumothorax;
• iatrogenic causes – surgery, endoscopy or positive pressure ventilation;
• spontaneous – a cause is not found, typically in older patients.
If it is extrathoracic, it could be:
• head and neck – trauma, tumour, surgery;
• subdiaphragmatic – due to perforation of a viscus with gas tracking superiorly and
through diaphragmatic openings.
Computed tomography (CT) is usually done if there is uncertainty about the radiograph
and to see the extent of free gas (Figure 67.2).

(a)

(b)

Figure 67.2 (a) Axial CT of the mediastinum showing mediastinal gas outlining the vessels and
trachea and in the subcutaneous tissues (arrows); (b) enlarged view of the mediastinum.
178

If there is suspicion of oesophageal rupture, a water-soluble contrast swallow test should
be done as there is a high risk for mediastinitis which has a poor prognosis (Figure 67.3).

(a)

(b)

Figure 67.3 (a) Lateral and (b) water-soluble contrast swallow. Adjacent outline of the tracheal
wall is seen due to interposed gas (arrow).

In Boerhaave’s syndrome, where there is oesophageal rupture secondary to vomiting,
the point of injury is typically in the left posterolateral wall a few centimetres above the
gastro-oesophageal junction, and the largest amount of gas may be in the left side of the
mediastinum. Neither of these signs is seen in Figure 67.3.
Rules governing licensing of radiology departments, which in the United Kingdom go
under the name IRMER (Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000), require
a physician to justify the investigation, a technical member of the department to perform
the investigation and a qualified person to review and report the outcome. In addition
is the principle of the ALARP (‘as low as reasonably possible’) dose. In routine practice,
people tend to think most about this when performing X-ray investigations on children
or pregnant women. The reason is that certain types of tissue, typically rapidly growing
or metabolically active tissue, is the most radiosensitive. It is worth remembering that
some adult tissue remains more radiosensitive, in particular breast, gonads and thyroid.
The process of calculating radiation doses and including tissue sensitivities to produce
an exposure that can be used in calculating risks is complicated and is often not required
in such detail because the clinical risk associated with an uncertain diagnosis may be
much higher (e.g. in pulmonary embolism). A few numbers are helpful to get a feel for
comparative doses. Annual background is about 3mSv, chest X-ray 0.02mSv, abdomen
0.7mSv, head CT 2mSv, chest CT 8mSv, abdominal/pelvis CT 10mSv.
Justification for an investigation usually rests on the clinical risk of complications of a
missed diagnosis, which are typically much larger than the long-term risk of X-ray exposure. In this case the surgical risk of mediastinitis and miscarriage justifies the exposure.
The ALARP principle may have been used in deciding to do the contrast swallow first as
a CT may not have been necessary if a leak had been demonstrated.
179

KEY POINTS

• Pneumomediastinum is easy to miss on a chest radiograph. Look for gas outlining the
upper mediastinal structures.

• If oesophageal rupture is suspected, a contrast swallow should be performed as there is
a high rate of mediastinitis and mortality.

• You need to be able to justify your investigations from a clinical and X-ray exposure
point of view.

CASE 68:

INFANT WITH A HEAD INJURY

History
A 4-month-old boy is brought into the paediatric accident and emergency department by
his parents with a head injury. The mother gives a history of the child falling from the
changing table earlier in the day and explains the delay in coming to hospital on difficulties getting transport. The child otherwise has an unremarkable medical and neonatal
history.
Examination
The child is listless but with normal observations. He responds to voice by eye opening but appears to move very little. He is probably a little under weight. There is a hard
irregularity in the left parietal scalp but no laceration. The fontanelles are not bulging.
There are no focal neurological signs. There appears to be some bruising over the left side
of the chest and a swollen left finger.
You are suspicious about the extent of the injuries and about the behaviour of the father
who appears to be keen to downplay the incident and leave. You discuss your concerns
with the registrar who admits the patient, arranges skull and chest radiographs (Figure
68.1 and 68.2) and contacts the on-call social services to see if the child is on the at-risk
register.

While in the radiology department, the child becomes unresponsive and is intubated to
maintain his airway.

nasogastric (NG) tube insertion, windowed to optimize
the bone appearance.

Questions
• What head injury does the child have?
• What else would you check for on the CT scan?
• Are further scans of the head indicated?
• Is there any sign of injury on the chest radiograph?
• What differential diagnoses should you consider?

182

This page intentionally left blank

ANSWER 68
The skull imaging shows a complex fracture of the left parietal bone extending from
the vertex inferiorly with some displacement of the fractured fragments. Not shown but
also apparent on the CT is a small subdural haemorrhage below the fracture. No signs
of raised intracranial pressure such as bulging fontanelles and compressed cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) spaces are seen and the brain parenchyma and ventricles appear normal. The
patient and images are reviewed by the neurosurgical centre.
On the chest radiograph, three posterior left rib fractures are seen overlying the heart
shadow with associated callus formation. The chest otherwise appears normal.
The unsaid differential so far is non-accidental injury (NAI), however, it is important to
consider the alternatives, if only to dismiss them, as the diagnosis of NAI has significant
consequences. Other differentials include accidental trauma (but current injuries are not in
proportion to the history), birth trauma (too long ago), osteogenesis imperfecta (no family history, no osteopenia seen) and rickets (requires imaging of long bone metaphyses).
Features that make NAI more likely are multiple fractures of varying ages, fractures
inconsistent with age or history or in unusual positions, posterior (rather than lateral) rib
fractures, metaphyseal corner fractures in children that have not started crawling/walking
and skull fractures that are complex, multiple, cross-sutures or not in the parietal bone.
Once a diagnosis of NAI has been considered as possible, the child is admitted for treatment and retained on the ward. The findings and management are reviewed by the most
senior paediatrician and social care services are immediately involved. In terms of further imaging, a skeletal survey is done to systematically document all and possible age
of bony injuries. If the CT is abnormal or there are neurological symptoms or ongoing
concern, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done that may show subdural haematomas of varying ages or cortical contusions or shearing injuries from shaking injury.
Delayed imaging may be helpful to show injuries acute at the time of presentation and
not easily seen (Figure 68.3).

finger metacarpal (see arrows) with a step in image a) and sclerosis and periosteal reaction in b).
184

KEY POINTS

• NAI is a differential diagnosis of any childhood fracture, although inconsistent history,
unusual and multiple fractures make the diagnosis more likely.

• Get senior and specialist review if you are suspicious.

CASE 69:

ABDOMINAL DISTENSION IN A WOMAN WITH

OVARIAN CANCER
History
A 65-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department with vomiting.
She is known to have metastatic ovarian carcinoma with a large primary tumour that is
invading surrounding structures. There are lung and liver metastases. She has recently
completed a course of chemotherapy. She complains of a long history of variable bowel
habit and has not opened her bowels for the last 2 days.
Examination
She looks thin and in discomfort. There is mild dehydration, no fever and observations
are normal. She has a distended abdomen that is soft but generally tender. There are
hyperactive bowel sounds on auscultation. Her chest is clear and heart sounds are normal.
You arrange an abdominal radiograph (Figure 69.1), review the staging computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis from a few months previously that describes metastatic
masses and organize a water-soluble contrast enema (Figure 69.2).

Figure 69.1 Abdominal radiograph.

Figure 69.2 Water-soluble contrast enema.
Oblique projection of the sigmoid colon.

Questions
• What does the abdominal radiograph show?
• What does the enema show?
• Where does the problem lie?

187

ANSWER 69
The large bowel is investigated by introducing gas or contrast rectally, known as an
enema. Barium enemas and CT colonograms require thorough bowel preparation and
a bowel relaxant such as buscopan is given. In a barium enema, barium contrast is
introduced into the bowel through a rectal tube and then mostly removed after coating
the large bowel round to the caecum. Gas is then introduced to distend the bowel and
radiographs are taken in several planes to view the entire bowel wall. In a CT colonogram, gas only is introduced to distend the bowel. Supine and prone scans are made with
intravenous contrast.
A water-soluble contrast enema is typically used in acute situations where there is risk
of perforation or likelihood of surgery, and does not require bowel preparation. Leakage
of barium into the abdominal cavity runs a high risk of barium peritonitis, although in
relatively healthy patients the risk is less than 1 in 3000.
The abdominal radiograph (Figure 69.1) shows gas within dilated bowel that demonstrates a haustral pattern (fold involving only part of the bowel wall) characteristic of
large bowel. The position is typical of the caecum and transverse colon with only a small
amount of gas in the descending and sigmoid colon. No gas is seen in the small bowel,
suggesting the terminal ileal valve is patent. The dilated bowel pattern suggests there is
an obstruction at the splenic flexure level.
In the water-soluble contrast enema (Figure 69.2), contrast was seen to flow through the
rectum, and into the sigmoid colon. Contrast passed no further than the mid-sigmoid
colon where a stricture was seen. The imaging suggests two strictures postioned in the
descending and mid-sigmoid colon.
The history and staging CT indicate that there is metastatic ovarian disease. Ovarian
carcinoma is the second most common gynaecological malignancy and fifth leading
cause of cancer deaths in women. Risk factors include nulliparity, early menarche, late
menopause and positive family history of ovarian, breast and early colorectal cancer.
It is often discovered late as abdominal symptoms of pain and distension, bowel habit
change, urinary frequency are often intermittent, non-specific and dismissed as common
abdominal twinges. The tumour spreads by direct extension, intraperitoneal implantation (often with ascites to produce omental deposits or ‘omental cake’) and lymphatic
and haematogenous spread, commonly to liver and lung. In this patient, there is bowel
obstruction remote from the tumour that invades the sigmoid colon and this may reflect
intraperitoneal implantation.
There are two aspects to this patient’s treatment. One is to relieve the immediate problem
of obstruction and the other is treating the underlying disease. With widespread metastases the underlying disease is treated with chemo- and radiotherapy. The obstruction is
treated by palliative surgery to create a colostomy or stent insertion.
Increasingly stents are being used for palliative treatment of strictures using either fluoroscopy (movable X-ray camera) or endoscopy to pass a wire through the stricture and
then fluoroscopy to insert the stent.

188

(b)

Figure 69.3 Abdominal radiograph showing stents in the rectosigmoid and descending colon.

KEY POINTS

• Bowel obstruction can be diagnosed if there is a transition point, where the bowel size
changes due to an intrinsic or extrinsic cause.

• Water-soluble contrast enemas are used in acute situations where the risk of
perforation or imminent surgery is high.

• Stents can be used to treat strictures, particularly in palliative care.

CASE 70:

WOMAN WITH A BREAST LUMP

History
A 48-year-old woman attends her general practitioner (GP) having noticed a lump in her
left breast while showering. The lump was non-tender and there had been no associated
discharge. She took no medication. She had never taken the oral contraceptive pill and
although recently post-menopausal, she had never taken hormone replacement therapy.
There was no family history of breast cancer. She was otherwise fit and well with no
previous medical or surgical history.
Examination
On examination there is a firm mass laterally and superiorly (in the upper outer quadrant). There are no overlying skin changes, but the mass felt firm and moves when tensing the pectoral muscles and asking the patient to raise her hands above her head. There
is also evidence of palpable left axillary lymph nodes. She is referred to the local breast
service symptomatic clinic. On arrival she has a standard set of mammograms taken
(Figures 70.1 and 70.2).

Figure 70.1 Standard cranial–caudal mammograms.

190

Figure 70.2 Standard medio-lateral-oblique mammograms.

Questions
• What do you notice on the mammograms?
• Which age group of women attend breast screening?
• What does the ultrasound in Figure 70.3 demonstrate?

Figure 70.3 Ultrasound.

191

ANSWER 70
The cranial–caudal (CC) and medio-lateral-oblique (MLO) views shown in Figures 70.1b and
70.2b, respectively, demonstrate a large irregular, spiculate tumour containing microcalcifications. The lesion is located lateral (see CC view) and slightly superior (see MLO view) to the nipple in approximately the 2 o’clock position in the left breast. This is the typical appearance of
a malignant breast carcinoma. For comparison the corresponding mammograms of the normal
right breast are included in Figures 70.1a and 70.2a. The mass is causing parenchymal distortion and extends posteriorly, hence explaining some fixation seen on clinical examination.
Mammography can be performed both in the context of screening (in the asymptomatic
woman) or diagnosis in the symptomatic patient. Until recently, women in the United
Kingdom were invited to attend breast screening from age 50 with a 3-year cycle and
continued to age 70. This has now been extended from 47 to 73 with self or GP referral
for older women. In younger, typically pre-menopausal women the breast tissue is denser,
making mammography less sensitive as a screening tool.
If an abnormality is found on screening it is graded, which determines the type of followup. Suspicious lesions are referred to a breast clinic. The standard breast mammogram
views are bilateral CC and MLO views, which are obtained with the breast compressed, as
seen in Figures 70.1 and 70.2.
Mammography is a form of low-dose radiograph used to create detailed images of the
breast and can demonstrate microcalcifications smaller than 100 μm. It may reveal a
lesion before it is palpable by examination, hence its use in screening. Mammographic
features suggestive of malignancy include microcalcifications, soft tissue mass, asymmetry or architectural distortion, all of which are demonstrated in Figure 70.1b.
In the breast clinic the patient undergoes a triple assessment of clinical review, mammography and ultrasound. The ultrasound shown in Figure 70.3 confirms a 3.1 cm mass
with ill-defined margins, casting an acoustic shadow. Ultrasound is a useful adjunct to
mammography and has the benefit of not using ionizing radiation. Ultrasound can help to
determine if a breast lesion is likely to be benign (e.g. a cyst or fibroadenoma) or malignant.
Malignant lesions are characteristically poorly defined with irregular margins and posterior
acoustic shadowing, as seen in Figure 70.3. Ultrasound is also used to guide biopsy and
therapeutic procedures. In this patient’s case, the lesion was an invasive ductal carcinoma.
In certain settings magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the breast may be indicated. This
is used for:
• further characterization of an indeterminate lesion (despite full assessment with
examination, mammography and ultrasound);
• detection of occult breast carcinoma in a patient with carcinoma in an axillary lymph node;
• multifocal or bilateral tumours;
• invasive lobular carcinoma, which has a high incidence of multifocality;
• evaluation of suspected, extensive, high-grade intraductal carcinoma;
• detection of recurrent breast cancer.
KEY POINTS

• Breast clinic assessment typically consists of the triple assessment of clinical review,
mammography and ultrasound.

• Mammography can be used both in screening and in symptomatic presentations such
as a breast lump or discharge.

• Ultrasound can be used to characterize breast lesions and guide biopsy.

A RISING CREATININE

History
A 57-year-old man was admitted overnight complaining of haematuria and lethargy. His
symptoms have been intermittent over the last month, with occasional macroscopic blood
seen when passing urine. He complains of an increase in frequency and nocturia but no
dysuria. There is no history to suggest any stigmata of infection.
He has no relevant past medical history and lives at home with his wife and two children.
As an ex-smoker he has a tobacco history of 20 pack-years with only occasional alcohol
usage.

Examination
Examination reveals that he is afebrile and in no obvious discomfort. Cardiovascular and
respiratory examinations are normal, but on abdominal examination there is fullness at
both renal angles and mild discomfort on deep palpation.
Blood results reveal a creatinine of 515 μmol/L with normal urea and potassium. A
routine blood result from 3 months previously recorded his creatinine as 72 μmol/L. His
inflammatory markers are not elevated and a blood gas does not demonstrate any acidosis. Ultrasound images were taken (Figures 71.1 and 71.2).

Figure 71.1 Ultrasound of left kidney.

Figure 71.2 Ultrasound of bladder.

Questions
• What does the ultrasound show?
• What options are available to resolve the situation?

193

ANSWER 71
These are two static ultrasound images of the left kidney and the bladder. The left kidney
image is acquired in a longitudinal orientation and demonstrates normal echogenicity
and shape with preserved corticomedullary differentiation and cortical thickness. There
are serpiginous areas of anechoic echogenicity associated with the renal medulla with
cortical extension in keeping with moderate pelivocalyceal dilatation (Figure 71.3).
Although not accurately demonstrated on this image, there is the suggestion of proximal
ureteric dilatation distal to the pelvico-ureteric junction (PUJ). Imaging of the right kidney revealed identical appearances.

Figure 71.3 Annotated ultrasound of left kidney.

The second image (Figure 71.2) is acquired in a transverse orientation within the pelvis
and demonstrates an adequately distended bladder with an area of irregular echogenicity
seen posteriorly at the expected level of the bladder trigone. This mass lesion measures
approximately 4.3 × 2.9 cm contiguous with the bladder wall. The vesico-ureteric junction (VUJ) and distal ureters are not demonstrated on this image. The features are likely
to represent a transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder with obstruction of both
the left and right kidneys. A staging computed tomography (CT) examination of the
chest, abdomen and bladder is recommended to characterize this further, with referral to
a urologist for continued management.
The CT scan confirmed a surgically resectable TCC with bilateral renal obstruction and no
evidence of local or distant spread. The patient ultimately requires a definitive surgical
procedure to remove the cancer, but at present, the ureteric obstruction and deterioration
in renal function makes the patient biochemically unstable. Surgery carries significant
risk, and in a non-life threatening situation, the patient should be physically and biochemically optimized to encourage a safe transition through the operation, reduce the
risk of intra-operative mortality and improve post-operative recovery. This patient is
currently a poor candidate for general anaesthesia, and as a bridge to surgery there are
two options available:
194

• Cystoscopy and retrograde ureteric stent insertion: Trained urologists can pass
a camera through the patient’s urethra and visualize the bladder TCC directly. Not
only does this allow for biopsy and tissue confirmation of the TCC, but if the VUJ is
adequately visualized, a guidewire can be passed into the ureter and a ‘double-J’ stent
inserted to relieve the VUJ obstruction. Cystoscopy can be performed under conscious
sedation but general anaesthesia is preferred. In this situation, it was felt that the
tumour mass would make VUJ cannulation very difficult, making this option inappropriate.
• Nephrostomy and antegrade ureteric stent insertion: This minimally invasive procedure is performed by a trained interventional radiologist and can be performed
under local anaesthesia only, although light sedation is sometimes required. The
patient lies on a fluoroscopy table in the prone position, and a micropuncture needle
is passed percutaneously under direct ultrasound imaging into a dilated lower pole
calyx. Ideally this should transgress Brodel’s bloodless line, an avascular area between
the anterior and posterior renal segments to reduce the risk of renal haemorrhage.
Instilling contrast into the collecting system under fluoroscopy can confirm satisfactory positioning (Figure 71.4).
Adopting the Seldinger technique, a guidewire can then be manipulated into the proximal ureter over which a sheath is passed to stabilize the position. A hydrophilic wire and
catheter combination is then used to transgress the VUJ and obstructing lesion for safe
passage of a stiff guidewire from the renal pelvis into the bladder. This allows careful
manipulation of an appropriately sized renal stent to be passed over the wire so that one
end lies within the bladder, and the other lies more proximally within the renal pelvis.
This acts as a conduit through which urine can drain for renal decompression (Figure
71.5).

confirming position of lower pole colyx.

Figure 71.5 Fluoroscopy study
positioning ureteric stent.

Stent positioning requires a high level of accuracy and it may also become obstructed
both by tumour overgrowth and stent migration. As a precautionary measure, an additional pigtail catheter is often left within the renal pelvis, running along the line of the
original percutaneous puncture to act as a urinary diversion both for initial decompression and in case of stent failure. This is termed a covering nephrostomy and remains in
position for the short term (Figure 71.6).
195

Figure 71.6 Fluoroscopy image
confirming ureteric stent placement
with covering nephrostomy.

Renal decompression will allow time for the renal function to return to normal and means
that the operation can be performed in a less urgent and more controlled environment.
Holistically, it also allows for the patient to make appropriate decisions about their own
management. The nephrostomy and stent can be removed intra-operatively, leaving only
a small cutaneous scar.

KEY POINTS

• Nephrostomy allows for biochemical and physical optimization before surgery.
• Nephrostomy insertion is ideally along Brodel’s bloodless line.
• Ultrasound guidance and a Seldinger technique are employed for nephrostomy
insertion.

CASE 72:

NECK PAIN AFTER FALLING

History
A 21-year-old woman is brought to the accident and emergency department with head
and neck trauma after falling from a horse. She is immobilized on a board with a hard
neck collar and complains of diffuse neck pain and mild intermittent tingling in the arms
and legs. There is no history of loss of consciousness, no evidence of head injury (she had
a riding helmet on) and no complaint of injury elsewhere. There is no significant past
medical history although the patient has had intermittent neck pain in the past that has
not been investigated.
Examination
Routine observations are stable and she is maintaining her airway, breathing and circulation. You perform a primary survey which reveals diffuse tenderness in the mid cervical
spine. There is abnormal sensation and hyperreflexia in lower and upper limbs. The chest,
abdomen and pelvis are normal. No limb fractures or dislocations are suspected. You
arrange trauma series radiographs of the neck (Figure 72.1).

(a)

(b)

Figure 72.1 (a) Anterior–posterior (AP) and (b) lateral cervical spine views from the trauma
series (normal AP peg view not shown). There is overlying artefact as the images are obtained
with immobilization blocks.

Questions
• Which lines do you review on cervical spine radiographs?
• Is there an abnormality on the radiograph?
• Do you have a differential diagnosis?
• What would you do next?

197

ANSWER 72
A trauma series of cervical spine radiographs includes a peg view of the dens through
the open mouth and various other views to ensure the C7/T1 junction is seen. If clear
views are not obtained or an acute abnormality is noted then a computed tomography
(CT) scan is the next step.
When assessing cervical spine radiographs, there are a number of lines that should be viewed
to help pick up abnormalities. On the lateral projection, the anterior and posterior vertebral
edges describe lines. The line through the junction of the lamina and the anterior edge of
the spinous processes (spinolaminar line) and the curve through the posterior tips of the
spinous processes should be reviewed. These lines should all be smooth and continuous with
no steps, although the natural curvature of the neck may be altered due to pain or immobilization. Any small fragments of bone should be considered for fractures although may be
ossification centres in younger patients or degenerative changes in older patients. On the AP
view look at the lines through and spacing between the spinous processes and the pedicles.
The radiographs show a gap in the spinolaminar line at C5 with absence of a normal
spinous process and an expanded appearance of both pedicles and lamina, best seen on
the AP projection. The anterior and posterior vertebral lines appear normal. No fracture
is identified, however, the appearance suggests a chronic expansile bone lesion involving
the pedicles and spinous process of C5 that may be narrowing the spinal canal. No significant soft tissue swelling or periosteal reaction is seen to suggest an aggressive process.
In the absence of a fracture, the patient’s acute symptoms are likely to be due to cord
trauma secondary to spinal stenosis (narrowing) that may be due to the underlying bone
lesion or a new haematoma. Spinal stenosis can be congenital or acquired and most often
affects the cervical or lumbar spine. Degenerative change or metastatic bone lesions are
common causes in patients over 50. Congenital or acquired primary bone lesions as well
as trauma are more common in younger patients.
A CT is required to characterize the bone changes and ensure there is no traumatic injury
(Figure 72.2).

(a)

(b)

Figure 72.2 (a) Coronal and (b) sagittal images of the patient’s cervical spine showing the
expansile lesion in the posterior elements of the C5 vertebra. No fracture is seen.
198

Given the patient’s neurology, an emergency magnetic resonance (MR) scan is required
to examine the spinal cord, nerve roots and soft tissue associated with the bone lesion
(Figure 72.3).

(a)

(b)

Figure 72.3 Sagittal MR (a) T1- and (b) T2-weighted images of the patient’s cervical spine.

The MR shows an expansile lesion of the C5 spinous process with associated narrowing
of the spinal canal and increased T2 signal (altered water content) within the spinal canal
at this point. The high signal is most likely to be inflammatory due to trauma and cord
swelling rather than a tumour or haemorrhage.
Given the patient’s age, possible differential diagnoses for expansile lesions in the cervical spine include benign tumours from the bone such as an aneurysmal bone cyst, as
in this case, or from the spinal cord or nerve roots such as a neurofibroma. Malignant
bone tumours are less likely given the age and history but could include lymphoma.
Osteomyelitis should also be ruled out although unlikely in this case.
The patient requires urgent referral to a neurosurgical/spinal orthopaedic centre for possible removal of the lesion to decompress the cord. Steroids may help to reduce cord
swelling.
KEY POINTS

• Acute or symptomatic spinal stenosis is an emergency and one of the few situations
requiring an emergency MR to view the cord.

• Degenerative changes and disc prolapse are the most common causes of spinal
stenosis, but the differential includes tumours and haematomas.

CASE 73:

A YOUNG MAN WITH BACK PAIN

History
This 25-year-old man presents to you in the accident and emergency department with
lower back pain that is so bad he is unable to walk. He gives a history of gradually worsening back pain over the last few months. He also complains of night sweats and bowel
disturbance. He does not give a history of other medical problems and says that he is not
working currently. He smokes 15 cigarettes a day and drinks at least 30 units a week. He
takes cannabis regularly but denies use of intravenous drugs.
Examination
On examination he is thin and appears to neglect his appearance. His blood pressure,
pulse and temperature are a little elevated. His chest and heart sounds are normal. The
abdomen is soft. There is evidence of injection sites in the forearms and antecubital fossae. He is extremely tender over the lower spine. Neurologically, he has reduced power
(4/5) on leg raising bilaterally.
You arrange investigations including a chest and lumbar spine radiograph (Figure 73.1)
and, on the basis of that, a magnetic resonance (MR) scan of the spine is arranged (Figure
73.2).

Figure 73.2 T1-weighted sagittal MR image of the lumbar spine, pre (a) and post (b) gadolinium
contrast.

Just to give a brief summary of MR, hydrogen is a ubiquitous atom present in water and
most biological molecules. In a magnetic field, the magnetic moment of the hydrogen
nucleus becomes polarized and can be switched between aligned parallel and antiparallel
with the magnetic field by radiofrequency pulses. Add in a magnetic field gradient to
change the frequency at which the protons resonate according to position and you have
the beginnings of spatial resolution and an MR image.
The protons relax from an ordered polarized state once the radiofrequency pulse has
stopped. The relaxation of polarization is measured with the T1 rate constant, and the
rate at which they become disorganized by T2. T1 and T2 are used as contrast parameters.
Fat and proteinaceous fluid have high T1 and T2 signals. Water has low T1and high T2
signal. Soft tissues are somewhere inbetween. Abnormalities often have high T2 signal.
T1 images tend to be used for anatomy, comparison with T2 images or used with gadolinium contrast (high T1 signal).

Questions
• What do the figures demonstrate?
• Why was an MR scan ordered?
• What is the differential diagnosis.
• What would you do next and how?
• What is the appropriate treatment?

201

ANSWER 73
The plain radiograph (Figure 73.1) shows loss of disc and vertebral height at L4 and L5.
In many ways the MR images (Figure 73.2) complement the plain radiograph. Although
the bone cortex appears dark, the marrow is bright due to fat. Loss of normal fat signal in
L4 and 5 vertebral bodies results from inflammation and increased water signal. Contrast
enhancement also reflects the pathological processes centred on the disc and affecting the
bone. MR is also excellent for looking at soft tissues, particularly in this case the anterior
paravertebral soft tissue mass as well as soft tissue impinging into the spinal canal and
on to the nerve roots and the spinal cord itself.
With this patient’s history there is a risk of immune suppression and a high risk of infection and the most likely diagnosis is infective discitis. Despite his denial, the injection
marks without any other explanation makes it likely that he uses intravenous drugs. The
differential diagnosis of malignancy is quite unlikely as this tends to affect primarily the
vertebra. Osteomyelitis is also a differential if there is not disc involvement, however, in
this case it is coexistent with the discitis.
Infection in the spine is typically the result of either bloodborne spread or through an
invasive procedure. Infections can be either pyogenic or non-pyogenic. Pyogenic discitis
most commonly involves Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative bacilli in intravenous
drug users or immunocompromised patients. Non-pyogenic discitis may be caused by
tuberculosis (TB).
In children, where there is still vascularization of the disc, the infection arises in the disc.
In adults, the infection arises in the vertebral endplate and then crosses the disc to the
next endplate. Typical changes seen on imaging include loss of disc height and increasing loss of vertebral endplates with destruction and collapse. There may be formation of
adjacent soft tissue masses or collections that may, particularly in TB, spread beneath the
longitudinal ligaments to involve multiple levels.
Diagnosis typically requires identification of the organism. In some cases this may be
secondary to infection or a collection elsewhere and identified on blood or other sample
culture. Otherwise a biopsy is required to obtain some infected tissue. This is typically
done using image-guided needle biopsy to negotiate the nerve roots and position the
needle tip in the optimum position (Figure 73.3). This patient’s biopsy yielded TB.

CASE 74:

A CHILD WITH AN INJURY

History
An 11-year-old boy is playing at an adventure park when he falls on the climbing frame,
catching his left thumb as he lands. There is immediate pain and swelling and he is
unable to move his thumb. His mother takes him to the local accident and emergency
department for evaluation.
Examination
He is distressed. His thumb is swollen with bony tenderness maximal in the region of
the thumb proximal pharynx and metacarpal. There is virtually no range of movement
at the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint or the interphalangeal joint. Capillary refill is
normal (less than 2 seconds) and sensation is intact distally. A request is filled out for
trauma views of the thumb to exclude a suspected fracture. The radiographs are seen in
Figure 74.1.

(a)

(b)

Figure 74.1

Question
• What do the trauma views of the thumb demonstrate?

205

ANSWER 74
On the first radiograph (Figure 74.1a) it is difficult to appreciate a bony injury, but the
second trauma view (Figure 74.1b) clearly demonstrates a fracture line passing through
the base of the thumb proximal phalynx metaphysis into the epiphyseal plate. The fracture line does not, however, pass through into the epiphysis. This is the classical appearance of a Salter–Harris type II fracture.
Salter–Harris fractures are fractures through a growth plate and, as a result, unique to
paediatric patients. They are common injuries found in children, occurring in approximately 15 per cent of long bone fractures. These fractures are classified according to the
involvement of the physis, metaphysis and epiphysis. This categorization of the injuries
is important because it not only affects patient treatment but may also alert the clinician
to potential longer term complications.
There are nine types of Salter–Harris fracture in total, although types I–V are the most
commonly referred to and were those described originally (the rarer types VI–IX have
been added subsequently). The radiographic findings vary according to the type of Salter–
Harris fracture.
The most common type of Salter–Harris fracture, is the type II fracture (see arrow Figure
74.2). This occurs through the physis and metaphysis, and the epiphysis is not involved
in the injury (no fracture is observed in the epiphysis).

Figure 74.2

Salter–Harris type II fractures tend to occur after age 10. The mechanism involves
shearing or avulsion with angular force. There is cartilage failure on the tension side.
Metapetaphyseal failure occurs on the compression side. There is a division between
epiphysis and metaphysis except for a flake of metaphyseal bone, which is carried with
the epiphysis. The metaphyseal fragment is sometimes called the Thurston–Holland frag206

ment. These fractures may cause minimal shortening, however healing is usually rapid
and Salter–Harris type II injuries rarely result in functional limitations.
With type I Salter–Harris fractures, initial radiographs may suggest separation of the
physis although this separation may not be apparent and soft tissue swelling typically
overlying the physis may provide the only clue. Follow-up radiographs within 2 weeks
after injury help establish the diagnosis. Adjacent sclerosis and/or periosteal reaction
along the epiphyseal plate supports the diagnosis of a Salter–Harris type I fracture. The
growing physis is not usually injured in type I fractures, however, and growth disturbance is uncommon.
The type III fracture passes through the physis and extends to split the epiphysis. The
fracture crosses the physis and extends into the articular surface of the bone. Type IV
injuries pass through the epiphysis, physis and metaphysis. As with type III fractures, the
type IV pattern is an intra-articular injury and therefore can result in chronic disability.
Type V fractures are compression/crush injuries of the epiphyseal plate, without associated epiphyseal or metaphyseal fracture. The initial plain radiographs in type V fracture
may not show a fracture line (similar to type I fractures). Soft-tissue swelling at the physis, however, is usually present. The clinical history is central to the diagnosis of type V
fractures and a typical history is that of an axial load injury. Type V injuries have a poor
functional prognosis.
KEY POINTS

• Salter–Harris fractures are fractures through a growth plate.
• Imaging findings vary according to the type of Salter–Harris fracture.
• The most common type of Salter-Harris fracture is the type II fracture which occurs
through the physis and metaphysis (the epiphysis is not involved in the injury).

• The diagnosis of type V may be particularly difficult, however is important as these
injuries have a poor functional prognosis.

• Two views are required in the evaluation of all cases of traumatic injury.

CASE 75:

A RENAL TRACT ABNORMALITY

History
A 60-year-old man presents to his general practitioner (GP). Over the course of the last
month he has noted bright red blood in his urine. He had hoped that it would simply
go away but instead he has now developed loin discomfort, particularly on the right. He
has not felt feverish or lost any weight. He is an ex-smoker and takes antihypertensive
medication, but otherwise he has been well.
Examination
He was afebrile and his observations were all within normal limits. Upon palpation the
abdomen was soft and no mass was felt. There was tenderness in the right renal angle but
no direct pain on palpation. His white cell count was slightly elevated at 13 × 109/L and
his C-reactive protein (CRP) is 20mg/L. He also demonstrates a mild normocytic anaemia
with a haemoglobin of 10.4g/dL. Urine dipstick reveals frank blood. He is referred for an
ultrasound scan which is reported as ‘bilateral hydronephrosis, although the bladder was
suboptimally distended therefore could not be completely evaluated.’ One longitudinal
image of the right kidney is seen in Figure 75.1. On the basis of the ultrasound scan,
further imaging with computed tomography (CT) was arranged with the local radiology
department. A coronal reconstructed image is seen in Figure 75.2.

Figure 75.1 Ultrasound image.

Question
• What do the ultrasound image in Figure
75.1 and the CT image in Figure 75.2
demonstrate?

Figure 75.2 CT scan.
209

ANSWER 75
Figure 75.1 demonstrates dilatation of the right renal pelvicalyceal system consistent with
hydronephrosis. Compare this appearance with that of a normal unobstructed kidney in
Figure 75.3.

Figure 75.3 Ultrasound of normal kidney.

Figure 75.2 shows a coronal contrast-enhanced CT image demonstrating dilatation of the
renal collecting system bilaterally.
This patient has bilateral hydronephrosis (seen on ultrasound and CT) in combination
with frank haematuria. A cystoscopy was then arranged which confirmed the presence of
a bladder lesion obstructing both ureteric orifices.
Hydronephrosis is distension and dilatation of the renal pelvis calyces, usually caused by
the obstruction of the free flow of urine from the kidney(s), and may lead to progressive
atrophy of the kidney(s). This case demonstrates only one cause of hydronephrosis.
A multitude of causes exist for hydronephrosis and hydroureter, ranging from benign
processes, such as the physiologic hydroureteronephrosis of pregnancy, to potential lifethreatening situations, such as infected hydronephrosis or pyonephrosis. Classification
can be made according to the level within the urinary tract (interruption can occur
anywhere along the urinary tract from the kidneys to the urethral meatus) and whether
the aetiology is intrinsic, extrinsic or functional. Causes at ureteric level can be intrinsic
(for example, ureteropelvic junction stricture, blood clot, retrocaval ureter), functional
(for example, gram-negative infection or neurogenic bladder) or extrinsic (for example,
retroperitoneal or pelvic malignancy or pregnancy). At the level of the bladder intrinsic
causes include carcinoma (as in this case), calculi, cystocele or diverticula; functional
causes include vesico-ureteric reflux; and extrinsic causes again include malignancy and
pelvic lipomatosis. Urethral causes may also be intrinsic, such as strictures or valves, or
extrinsic, such as prostatic pathology.
Although patients usually present with signs or symptoms, hydronephrosis can be
an incidental finding encountered during the evaluation of an unrelated process.
210

Hydronephrosis that occurs acutely with sudden onset (for example, due to a renal calculus) can cause intense pain in the flank area, while a chronic occurrence that develops
gradually will present with no pain or attacks of a dull discomfort. Nausea and vomiting
may also occur. An obstruction that occurs at the urethra or bladder outlet can cause
pain and pressure resulting from distension of the bladder. Blocking the flow of urine
will commonly result in urinary tract infections which can lead to the development of
additional stones, fever, and blood or pus in the urine. If complete obstruction occurs,
kidney failure may follow.
If unrecognized or left untreated, hydronephrosis/hydroureter secondary to obstruction
can lead to hypertension, loss of renal function, and sepsis. Consequently, patients found
to have hydronephrosis or hydroureter should undergo a thorough evaluation. The specific treatment of a patient with hydronephrosis depends on the aetiology of the process,
with any signs of infection within the obstructed system warranting urgent intervention
(as infection of an obstructed system may progress rapidly to sepsis).

KEY POINTS

• The appearances of hydronephrosis on ultrasound or CT are of a dilated renal pelvis
and calyceal system.

• A multitude of causes exist, with classification made according to the level within the
urinary tract and whether the aetiology is intrinsic, extrinsic or functional.

• Treatment of hydronephrosis focuses upon the removal of the obstruction and/or
drainage of the urine that has accumulated behind the obstruction.

• Any sign of infection within an obstructed system should prompt urgent intervention.

CASE 76:

SHOOTING LEG PAIN FOLLOWING LIFTING

History
A 63-year-old man is lifting boxes at home when he experiences the sudden onset of
lower back pain. The pain is so severe that he is unable to move and consequently calls
an ambulance. Upon admission to accident and emergency he describes the pain as sharp
and radiating down his legs, more severe on the left.
Examination
On examination there are reduced ankle reflexes and weakness of plantar flexion at the
ankle on both sides. He is unable to straight leg raise on the left. He is admitted under the
orthopaedic team for management of the pain and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan is performed (Figures 76.1 and 76.2).

Figure 76.1 Sagittal T2-weighted MR image of the
lumbar-sacral spine.

Figure 76.2 Axial T2-weighted MR image.

Questions
• What do the MRI images show?
• What is the reason for these appearances?
213

ANSWER 76
Figure 76.1 is a sagittal T2-weighted MR image of the lumbar-sacral spine, which demonstrates a disc prolapse at the level of L5/S1. Figure 76.2 is an axial T2-weighted MR
image through the level of the disc herniation, which demonstrates the disc effacing the
left L5 nerve root as it exits the spinal canal.
A spinal disc herniation is a medical condition affecting the spine, in which a tear in the
outer, fibrous ring (annulus fibrosus) of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion
(nucleus pulposus) to bulge out. Tears are frequently posterolateral owing to the presence of
the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. Nuclear material that is displaced into
the spinal canal is associated with an inflammatory response, and the tear in the disc ring
can result in the release of inflammatory chemical mediators which may directly cause pain,
even in the absence of nerve root compression. This is the rationale for using anti-inflammatory medication for pain associated with disc herniation, protrusion, bulge or disc tear.
A weakened annulus is a necessary condition for herniation to occur. Many cases involve
trivial trauma, sometimes in the presence of repetitive stress. Traumatic injury to lumbar
discs commonly occurs when lifting while bent at the waist, rather than lifting with the
legs while the back is straight.
Lumbar disc herniations occur most often between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebral
bodies or between L5 and the S1 (as in this example). Symptoms can affect the lower
back, buttocks, thigh, anal or genital region (via the perineal nerve) and may radiate into
the foot. The sciatic nerve is the most commonly affected nerve, causing symptoms of
sciatica. The femoral nerve may also be affected.
Plain radiographs do not demonstrate disc herniation but are useful in the diagnosis of
other conditions, particularly fracture, bone metastases or infection, and should be the
primary imaging modality when trauma, malignancy or infection are suspected.
MR imaging is the modality of choice for delineating herniated nucleus pulposus and its
relationship with adjacent soft tissues. On MRI, disc prolapses appear as focal, asymmetric
protrusions of disc material beyond the confines of the annulus. Herniation of the nucleus
pulposus are usually hypo-intense, however, because disc herniations are often associated
with a radial annular tear, high signal intensity in the posterior annulus is often seen on
sagittal T2-weighted images.
On sagittal MR images the relationship of herniation of the nucleus pulposus and degenerated facets to exiting nerve roots within the neural foramina is well delineated. In
addition, free fragments of the disc are easily detected on MRI.
In cases of disc bulging, early MR findings include loss of the normal posterior disc
concavity. Moderate bulges appear as non-focal protrusions of disc material beyond the
borders of the vertebrae. Bulges are typically broad based, circumferential and symmetric.
A radial tear of the annulus fibrosus is considered a sign of early disc degeneration. It is
accompanied by other signs of disc degeneration, such as a bulging annulus, loss of disc
height, herniation of the nucleus pulposus and changes in the adjacent endplates.
KEY POINTS

• Herniation of the nucleus pulposus through an annular defect causes focal protrusion
of the disc material beyond the margins of the adjacent vertebral endplate.

• MR imaging is the modality of choice for demonstrating the relationship of the herniated
nucleus pulposus and degenerated facets to exiting nerve roots within the neural foramina.

CASE 77:

A CHRONIC PRODUCTIVE COUGH

History
A 30-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with a fever and a cough. She has a history
of repeated chest infections for several years, two of which have required hospital admission. She has been coughing up yellow-green purulent sputum for two days. She has had
some streaky haemoptysis but is not worried as this has occurred on previous occasions.
Examination
Her observations were stable with a heart rate of 80 per minute and a blood pressure of
124/82. Her respiratory rate was 22 per minute, with reduced air entry bilaterally and
diffuse coarse crackles most pronounced over the lower zones posteriorly. Her blood
haematology showed a leucocytosis and raised C-reactive protein. Her biochemistry and
liver function tests were normal. Chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scans
were taken (Figures 77.1 and 77.2).

Figure 77.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 77.2 Axial CT image taken at the level
of the lower lobes.

Question
• What do the chest radiograph and axial CT image demonstrate?
215

ANSWER 77
The chest radiograph (Figure 77.1) shows ring opacities (cystic changes) due to the dilatation of bronchi with crowding of the vascular markings and prominent parallel lines
(tram tracks) presenting thickened walls of the dilated bronchi.
On the axial CT scan through the lower lobes the bronchi are dilated and larger than the
accompanying vessels. This is abnormal and sometimes referred to as the ‘signet ring
sign’. The signet ring sign consists of a small circle of soft tissue attenuation that abuts a
ring of soft tissue attenuation surrounding a larger low attenuating circle of air. The ring
of soft tissue attenuation represents the wall of the dilated bronchus seen on an axial CT
scan, whereas the low attenuating circle of air represents air within the dilated bronchus.
The circle of soft tissue attenuation abutting the ring represents the pulmonary artery that
lies adjacent to the dilated bronchus seen in cross-section. In Figure 77.2 dilated, thickwalled, slightly ectatic bronchi are demonstrated within both lower lobes.
Bronchiectasis is the irreversible dilatation of part of the bronchial tree. The bronchi
involved are dilated, inflamed and collapsible. This results in airflow obstruction and
impaired clearance of secretions. Bronchiectasis is associated with a wide range of disorders, some inherited, such as cystic fibrosis or agammaglobulinaemia, and some acquired,
such as necrotizing bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcus or Klebsiella or early
childhood infections caused by measles or Bordetella pertussis.
Haemoptysis, as experienced by the patient in this case, is common and may occur in up
to 50 per cent of patients. Episodic haemoptysis with little sputum production or ‘dry’
bronchiectasis is a sequela of tuberculosis. When massive haemoptysis occurs, the bleeding usually originates in dilated bronchial arteries, which contain blood at systemic as
opposed to pulmonary pressures.
The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is based on a clinical history of frequent viscid sputum
production and characteristic CT scan findings.
Chest radiography is usually the first imaging examination, but the findings are often
non-specific and the images may appear normal in patients with minor to moderate
disease. Abnormal radiographic findings may be non-specific and confirmation using
high-resolution CT (HRCT) scanning may be required.
Although subtle, thick-walled and dilated bronchi are present on the radiograph in Figure
77.1. Potential abnormal plain radiographic findings in bronchiectasis include: parallel
line ‘tram track’ opacities caused by thickened dilated bronchi; ring opacities or cystic
spaces as large as 2 cm in diameter resulting from cystic bronchiectasis, sometimes with
air–fluid levels; tubular opacities caused by dilated fluid-filled bronchi; increased size
and loss of definition of the pulmonary vessels in the affected areas as a result of peribronchial fibrosis; crowding of pulmonary vascular markings from the associated loss of
volume, usually caused by mucous obstruction of the peripheral bronchi; oligaemia as a
result of reduction in pulmonary artery perfusion in severe disease; signs of compensatory hyperinflation of the unaffected lung.
CT, in particular HRCT, scanning has become the imaging modality of choice for demonstrating and defining the extent of bronchiectasis. HRCT allows evaluation of the surrounding lung tissue and assessment for other lesions.
On HRCT scans in patients with bronchiectasis, the internal bronchial diameter may be
greater than that of the adjacent artery and there may be a lack of bronchial tapering. The
bronchi may be within 1 cm of costal pleura or abut the mediastinal pleura and bronchial
216

wall thickening may be seen. A cystic cluster of thin-walled cystic spaces may be present,
often with air–fluid levels.

KEY POINTS

• Plain chest radiographs are usually the first imaging examination, but the findings
•

are often non-specific and the images may appear normal in patients with minor to
moderate disease.
HRCT scanning is the diagnostic modality of choice and has few limitations.

CASE 78:

GENERAL FATIGUE AND WEAKNESS

History
A 65-year-old man presents to his general practitioner (GP) with breathing difficulty over
the past month, along with problems chewing, talking and walking up the stairs in his
house. Of particular concern, he had noticed his eyelids drooping and he had difficulty
maintaining a steady gaze. He noted that he has felt persistently fatigued and his symptoms worsened with activity and improved with rest.
Examination
He was afebrile. His pulse was 74/minute and blood pressure 126/78. The chest was clear,
breath sounds vesicular although there was reduced expansion and a respiratory rate of
22/minute.
Neurological examination demonstrated bilateral ptosis along with weakness of the arms,
legs and swallowing muscles. The jaw was slack and the voice had a nasal quality. Muscle
weakness was worsened by repetitive or sustained use of the muscles involved. Recovery
of strength was seen after a period of rest.
Full blood count and biochemistry were normal. Due to the difficulty in breathing, the
patient was referred for a chest radiograph (Figure 78.1) and computed tomography (CT)
scan (Figure 78.2).

Figure 78.1 Chest radiograph.

Figure 78.2 CT scan.

Questions
• What is the abnormality on the chest radiograph?
• Where is the lesion anatomically located?
• Does Figure 78.2 confirm your suspicion?
• What is the differential diagnosis?

219

ANSWER 78
Figure 78.1 shows a smooth, well-defined mass arising from the left side of the mediastinum.
By virtue of the fact that the margin of the descending thoracic aorta can be clearly seen,
this mass does not lie within the posterior mediastinum. Furthermore, the hilar structures
can also be seen making the middle mediastinum an unlikely location. Indeed the axial CT
scan seen in Figure 78.2 demonstrates that the mass lies within the anterior mediastinum.
Anatomically the mediastinum lies between the right and left pleura, in and near the
median sagittal plane of the chest. It extends from the sternum in front to the vertebral
column behind, and contains all the thoracic viscera except the lungs.
It may be divided into superior and inferior parts:
• The superior mediastinum lies above the upper level of the pericardium at the plane
drawn from the sternal angle to the disc of T4–T5 (angle of Louis).
• The inferior mediastinum lies below the superior margin of the pericardium and is further subdivided into three parts: anterior – in front of the pericardium; middle – containing the pericardium and its contents; posterior – behind the pericardium.
The mediastinum is surrounded by the chest wall anteriorly, the lungs laterally and
the spine posteriorly. It is continuous with the loose connective tissue of the neck, and
extends inferiorly onto the diaphragm.
The location of a mass within the mediastinum can be deduced radiologically on the plain
chest radiograph by assessing a number of radiological landmarks. In Figure 78.1 the margin
of the descending aorta and thoracic vertebrae/ribs, which are posterior mediastinal structures, can be seen crisply and clearly. This suggests that the lesion is not within the posterior
mediastinum (where the presence of a mass located in opposition to these structures would
cause a silhouette sign). The vascular structures of the hilum are also preserved. Therefore, the
mass most likely lies within the anterior compartment. This is confirmed on CT (Figure 78.2).
The anterior mediastinum contains the following structures: thymus, lymph nodes, pulmonary artery, phrenic nerves and thyroid. The most common lesions encountered in the
anterior mediastinum arise from thyroid, thymic (thymoma) or lymph node (lymphoma)
origin. Germ cell tumours (teratoma) arise from pluripotent cells of the thymus.
This case was later proven to be a thymoma, in the context of myasthenia gravis. Indeed
as many as 30–40 per cent of patients who have a thymoma experience symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis. The thymus is a lymphoid organ located in the anterior
mediastinum. In early life, the thymus is responsible for the development and maturation
of cell-mediated immunological functions.
The thymus gland is located behind the sternum in front of the great vessels. It reaches
its maximum weight at puberty and undergoes involution thereafter. Peak incidence of
thymoma occurs in the fourth to fifth decade of life. No sexual predilection exists.
Of patients with a thymoma, one-third to one-half are asymptomatic. Others often present
with local symptoms related to the tumour encroaching on surrounding structures. These
patients may present with cough, chest pain, superior vena cava syndrome, dysphagia and
hoarseness (if the recurrent laryngeal nerve is involved). One-third of thymoma cases are
found on radiographic examinations during a work-up for myasthenia gravis, as in this case.
KEY POINTS

• The anatomical location of a mediastinal mass may be deduced from the plain
radiograph by assessing for anatomical landmarks.

CASE 79:

A CERVICAL SPINE INJURY FOLLOWING A HORSE-

RIDING ACCIDENT
History
A 14-year-old girl is thrown from her horse while making a jump. She landed on her head
with her neck in the hyperflexed position. She denies any loss of consciousness, although
she is taken into accident and emergency with her neck immobilized, complaining of
severe pain in her lower cervical spine. She had sustained no other obvious injury and
has no significant medical history.
Examination
She is maintaining her airway. Examination of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is unremarkable. Neurological assessment fails to demonstrate a focal deficit. Sensation, power
and reflexes are normal in all four limbs. Per rectal examination reveals normal tone.
There is concern regarding her cervical spine injury, therefore a lateral radiograph is performed (Figure 79.1). A computed tomography (CT) scan is subsequently performed with
a sagittal reformat image shown in Figure 79.2.

Figure 79.1 Lateral radiograph.

Figure 79.2 Sagittal reformat CT scan.

Questions
• What does the lateral cervical spine radiograph show?
• What does the CT scan demonstrate?

221

ANSWER 79
This 14-year-old girl has sustained a hyperflexion ‘teardrop’ fracture of C7 which is
also crushed. There is wedging of the vertebral body with retropulsion of the posterior
fragment into the spinal canal. This can be seen on both the initial lateral radiograph
Figure 79.1 and more clearly on the sagittal CT image of the cervical spine (Figure 79.2).
A flexion teardrop fracture occurs when flexion of the spine, along with vertical axial
compression, causes a fracture of the anterior–inferior aspect of the vertebral body. This
fragment is displaced anteriorly and resembles a teardrop.
For this fragment to be produced significant posterior ligamentous disruption must occur
and as the fragment displaces anteriorly, a significant degree of anterior ligamentous
disruption must take place.
This example demonstrates a flexion injury, however, cervical spine injuries are classified according to several other mechanisms of injury in addition to flexion, including
flexion–rotation, extension, extension–rotation, vertical compression, lateral flexion and
mechanisms resulting in odontoid (C2) fractures and atlanto-occipital dislocation.
The cervical spine should be seen as three distinct columns:
• Anterior column: This is composed of the anterior longitudinal ligament and the
anterior two-thirds of the vertebral bodies, the annulus fibrosus and the intervertebral
discs.
• Middle column: This is composed of
the posterior longitudinal ligament and
the posterior one-third of the vertebral
bodies, the annulus and intervertebral
discs.
• Posterior column: This contains all of
the bony elements formed by the pedicles, transverse processes, articulating
facets, laminae and spinous processes.
If one column is disrupted, other columns
may provide sufficient stability to prevent
spinal cord injury. If two columns are
disrupted, the spine may move as separate
units, increasing the likelihood of spinal
cord injury.
This fracture is important to recognize
as it is an unstable type of cervical spine
fracture involving disruption of all three
spinal columns, making this an extremely
unstable fracture that frequently is associated with spinal cord injury.
The girl in this case was referred to the spinal service and initially managed with the
application of traction with cervical tongs,
but later underwent a C7 corpectomy and
fusion (Figure 79.3).
Figure 79.3 Lateral radiograph post surgery
showing C7 corpectomy and fusion.
222

When interpreting lateral cervical views, first you should check the technical adequacy
of the radiograph, which must show all seven vertebral bodies and the cervicothoracic
junction. Next, look for soft tissue changes in predental and prevertebral spaces (if the
prevertebral space is widened at any level, a haematoma secondary to a fracture is likely).
At the level of C2, prevertebral space should not exceed 7mm and at the level of C6 and
below, where the prevertebral space is widened by the presence of the oesophagus and
cricopharyngeal muscle, no more than 22mm in adults/14mm in children younger than
15 years.
Then check the alignment of the cervical spine by following three imaginary contour
lines:
• The first line connects the anterior margins of all the vertebrae and is referred to as
the anterior contour line. It is clearly disrupted in Figure 79.1.
• The second line should connect the posterior aspect of all vertebrae in a similar way
and is referred to as the posterior contour line. This is also disrupted in Figure 79.1.
• The third line should connect the bases of the spinous processes. This is referred to as
the spinolaminar line.
KEY POINTS

• Approximately 85–90 per cent of cervical spine injuries are evident in lateral view.
• An acceptable lateral view must show all seven vertebral bodies and the
cervicothoracic junction.

• It is important to check the alignment of cervical spine by following three imaginary
contour lines.

• Soft tissue changes in predental and prevertebral spaces should always be looked for.

CASE 80: ABDOMINAL PAIN AND DIARRHOEA IN A 28-YEAR-OLD
WOMAN
History
You are asked to review the abdominal radiograph of a 28-year-old woman who has
presented to the accident and emergency department with worsening abdominal pain and
diarrhoea. She is known to have a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and, despite occasional
disease exacerbations as a teenager, she has been symptom free for 5 years.
Over the last 2 days she has been complaining of generalized aching abdominal pain. This
is associated with diarrhoea that is increasing in frequency and yesterday she opened her
bowels nine times. Overnight she was unable to control her loose motions and noticed
fresh blood with streaks of pus within the stool. She denies weight loss but gives a history of feeling very lethargic.
She attended the accident and emergency department worried about an acute attack of
ulcerative colitis and was found to be tachycardic but normotensive on examination.
Her abdomen was distended but not peritonitic, and she reported pain on deep palpation, most marked within the left upper quadrant. Her blood results suggest a degree of
renal impairment and dehydration, with a slightly elevated white cell count but normal
haemoglobin.

Examination
As part of the initial investigations an abdominal radiograph was performed (Figure 80.1).

Figure 80.1 Abdominal radiograph.

Questions
• What does the abdominal radiograph demonstrate?
• What further imaging is recommended?
• Is there a differential diagnosis for these appearances?
225

ANSWER 80
This is an anterior–posterior abdominal radiograph of an adult female. There is gross
abnormality of the large bowel with widespread dilatation most marked at the splenic
flexure, where the maximal bowel diameter measures 10.3 cm (normal large bowel
diameter <6 cm). There is abnormal thickening and ‘thumbprinting’ of the colonic wall
with loss of normal haustrations due to mucosal oedema. There is no evidence of small
bowel involvement and no characteristic appearances of ‘Rigler’s sign’ (see below) to
suggest extraluminal free gas related to bowel perforation. The appearances are consistent with colitis with bowel dilatation, in keeping with toxic megacolon. Urgent
surgical opinion should be sought and clinical correlation advised since perforation is
a significant risk.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended to characterize the radiograph findings further (Figure 80.2). Ideally, this should be performed
with intravenous contrast in the portal venous phase, however, renal function derangement from fluid sequestration may make this impossible. The possible need for surgery is
a relative contraindication to oral contrast enhancement.
Dilated sigmoid colon

Pericolic fat stranding

Thickened odematous wall
with hyperenhancement of
mucosal surface

Figure 80.2 Enhanced CT scan.

This single enhanced CT image acquired at a level just superior to the femoral acetabulae
demonstrates dilatation and thickening of the sigmoid colon. There is hyperenhancement
of the mucosa and muscularis propria, which outline an iso-attenuating oedematous
submucosa. There is associated pericolic fat stranding. These findings suggest acute
inflammatory change. There is no evidence of free fluid within the pelvis and no extraluminal free gas on this image, although the whole study should be reviewed to exclude
perforation.
Inflammation of the colon is termed ‘colitis’ and its causes are numerous:
• Infection: bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella), parasites (amoebiasis), fungi (histoplasmosis)
and viruses (HIV, CMV) can all cause pancolitis and marked wall oedema.
226

• Ischaemia: The splenic flexure/descending colon are a watershed area demarcated by
the blood supply from the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. It is particularly
susceptible to ischaemia of any cause (e.g. atherosclerosis), and the colitic appearances
can mimic inflammatory bowel disease. The characteristic appearance of air within the
wall of the colon is termed ‘pneumatosis coli’ and is highly suggestive of ischaemic
colitis. It is usually a premorbid phenomenon (Figure 80.3).

Figure 80.3 Scan showing air within the wall
of the colon: pneumotosis coli.

• Pseudomembranous: Often caused by an overgrowth of the Clostridium difficile bacterium related to antibiotic usage, predisposed patients can suffer a pancolitis with
deterioration to toxic megacolon.
• Inflammatory bowel disease: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease are difficult to
differentiate by history alone and require histological characterization. Radiologically,
UC is often left sided with shallow mucosal ulcers extending down to the rectum with
small bowel sparing. Crohn’s is a discontinuous, full thickness disease, often with deep
penetrating ulcers sparing the rectum and commonly seen at the terminal ileum.
• Toxic megacolon: This can occur in any form of colitis, but is particularly prevalent
in UC. Uncontrolled fulminant colitis can lead to transmural involvement with rapid
dilatation of the large bowel. There are large fluid shifts and the patient is often toxic
and shocked. As a surgical emergency, it requires rapid identification and carries a
significant risk of mortality.
Named after Leo George Rigler, an American radiologist, the eponym ‘Rigler’s sign’ was
derived from his paper entitled ‘Spontaneous pneumoperitoneum: a roentgenologic sign
found in the supine position’.1 Until 1941, the only documented sign of intraperitoneal
free gas was seeing crescenteric gas contrasted against the diaphragm and solid abdominal viscera on erect chest radiographs. Rigler described that is it possible to ‘observe both
the contour of the inner and outer wall of the bowel’1 in supine positioning when there
is significant intraperitoneal free gas. This is also known as the ‘double wall sign’, and
is an abnormal finding unless the patient has undergone recent surgery or laparoscopy
(Figure 80.4).

227

Rigler’s double wall sign

Figure 80.4 Radiograph showing Rigler’s sign.

KEY POINTS

• The bowel is said to be dilated when the cross-sectional diameter exceeds 3cm for
small bowel and 6 cm for large bowel.

• Pneumatosis coli is highly suggestive of ischaemic colitis and carries high mortality.
• ‘Rigler’s sign’ is pathognomonic for the diagnosis of intraperitoneal free gas.

CASE 81:

PAIN IN THE LEFT WRIST FOLLOWING A FALL

History
A 65-year-old woman attends her local accident and emergency department following
a mechanical fall. While walking her dog this morning, she slipped on the icy pavement
and fell forward, putting out her left hand to break her fall. She heard a ‘crack’ and had
an instant sharp stabbing pain in her left wrist. Noticing an obvious deformity and experiencing severe pain on all movements, she called her husband who collected her and
bought her to hospital.
She has a history of gallstone disease and a cholecystectomy. She went through the
menopause aged 55 years, and was on hormone replacement therapy for the following
6 years. She has never had a bone density scan or suffered any previous fractures. She
takes no regular medication and has never taken corticosteroids.

Examination
The triage nurse has requested a wrist X-ray (Figure 81.1).

Questions
• What does this X-ray show?
• What is the common mechanism of
injury and how is it treated?

Figure 81.1 Lateral radiograph of the left wrist.
229

ANSWER 81
Figure 81.1 is a lateral radiograph of the left wrist in an adult patient. There is abnormality seen in the distal radius with interruption of the normal smooth cortical line, and a
linear cortical breach extending horizontally through the distal radius. There is loss of
normal alignment with the distal radius fragment dorsally angulated by approximately
30 degrees. The radiocarpal joint is not involved but the carpal bones are displaced posteriorly with associated overlying soft tissue swelling. It is normal practice to look at the
wrist in two views.
This anterior–posterior (AP) view of the same patient (Figure 81.2) confirms a comminuted fracture of the distal radius with dorsal angulation of the distal fragment. There
is also a fracture of the ulna styloid with medial displacement of the distal fragment
associated with soft tissue swelling. No other bony injury is seen, most importantly to the
scaphoid. There is no radiographic evidence of scapholunate dislocation. These features
are in keeping with a complex Colles’ fracture to the left wrist.

Figure 81.2 AP radiograph view of the left
wrist.

This type of wrist fracture is named after Abraham Colles, an Irish surgeon from Dublin
(1773–1843). A Colles’ fracture is the commonest fracture to the forearm and is usually
sustained from a mechanical fall. The patient uses an outstretched hand to break the
fall, with the radius fracturing horizontally approximately 2cm from the articulating
surface. The patient’s bodyweight forces the distal fracture fragment dorsally and commonly fractures the ulna styloid in the process. The nature of the injury predisposes the
osteoporotic elderly and active young patients (skateboarders, snowboarders) to this type
230

of fracture. Reduction of the fracture is essential to reduce the long-term risks of fused
misalignment, deformity, reduced range of movement and joint osteoarthritis. This is
most commonly done in the accident and emergency department under sedation and
local anaesthetic (Bier’s block). The wrist is reduced and temporarily placed in a cast, held
in palmar flexion with ulna deviation to maintain the reduction. Orthopaedic assessment
in the fracture clinic may leave undisplaced fractures in a cast with no further treatment,
however significant deformity usually requires surgical fixation, taking into account age,
hand dominance, occupation, radial variance, intra-articular extension and dorsal tilt
(>20 degrees).
The four commonest adult wrist fractures to recognize are shown in Figure 81.3.

Colles fracture
Smith fracture

Barton fracture

Chauffeur fracture

Figure 81.3 Adult wrist fractures.
Reproduced from Reference 1
with permission.

In addition to Colles’ fracture, these include:
• Smith fracture: Commonly called the reverse Colles’ fracture, this is commonly seen
in older osteoporotic patients who fall onto a clenched fist. A horizontal fracture to
the distal radius is sustained with volar angulation of the distal fragment.
• Barton fracture: This injury, also sustained by falling on an outstretched hand, fractures the radial head vertically with dorsal angulation to the distal fragment. This has
intra-articular extension and is associated with carpal dislocation.
• Chauffeur fracture: Sudden ulnar deviation and dorsiflexion causes an avulsion fracture to the radial styloid with lateral displacement of the fracture fragment. Associated
with lunate dislocation, these fractures were commonly sustained by chauffeurs when
an automobile backfired during a hand crank start.
KEY POINTS

• A Colles’ fracture is the commonest fracture of the forearm and is usually sustained by
falling on an outstretched hand.

• Fracture reduction is essential to reduce the risk of long-term osteoarthritis.
• Fracture clinic assessment is integral in the follow-up of all fractures.

CASE 82:

A KNOWN CASE OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE

History
A barium follow-through study has been requested on a 22-year-old woman who has a
history of Crohn’s disease. She presented 2 days earlier with abdominal pain localized to
the left lower quadrant and occasional diarrhoea. She denies vomiting and is still passing
flatus freely. Despite taking her Crohn’s medication regularly, she feels this is an acute
flare-up of her disease and sought medical attention.
Examination
Examination reveals a patient who is comfortable at rest with normal observations. Her
abdomen is generally soft on palpation but there is local guarding and tenderness in the
left iliac fossa. Per rectal examination does not demonstrate rectal blood.
Investigations show an elevated white cell count (90 per cent neutrophils) with normal
renal and liver function tests. Her C-reactive protein is 160 mg/L.
An abdominal radiograph did not demonstrate bowel obstruction and a barium followthrough study is requested to assess her bowel mucosa and look for fibrotic strictures
(Figure 82.1).

Figure 82.1 Barium follow-though.

Questions
• How is this procedure performed and what does it demonstrate?
• What other imaging modalities are used to diagnose and follow-up patients with
Crohn’s disease?
• What are the extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn’s disease?

233

ANSWER 82
This is a single image of a barium follow-though study, acquired with the patient in a
prone position and centred on the right lower quadrant. There is good opacification of
the small bowel, and contrast appears to have passed freely into the large bowel with
opacification of the descending colon. This image demonstrates a 25cm stricture of the
terminal ileum, with the adjacent caecal pole also appearing abnormal and oedematous.
There is small bowel loop separation in the right lower quadrant, probably related to lymphoedema of the bowel wall and adjacent fibrofatty proliferation, however an inflammatory mass lesion (e.g. abscess) needs to be excluded. There is no prestenotic dilation and
the appearance of the remaining small bowel is normal. The findings are in keeping with
active inflammatory stricture related to Crohn’s disease, and a computed tomography (CT)
abdomen and pelvis is recommended to exclude a drainable collection.
Local hospital policy dictates the exact procedural technique of a barium follow-through
study: a patient is required to drink a set volume of radio-opaque barium, often diluted
with water and mixed with a prokinetic agent (e.g. metoclopramide) to promote rapid
transit through the bowel. The barium is screened though the small bowel under fluoroscopy, and sequential images are obtained at different points in time. The patient is often
imaged in the prone position to splay the bowel loops and reduce composite shadowing
from overlying loops of bowel. Focal compression can improve visualization as demonstrated in this image, with the compression paddle highlighting the area of tapered narrowing at the terminal ileum.
As well as small bowel follow-through studies, there is also a role for both CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT scan is quick to perform and usually accessible
24 hours per day, but it carries a significant radiation exposure and Crohn’s patients
are often young. CT is employed in the acute setting to characterize the extent of acute
inflammation and also to exclude abscess formation (Figure 82.2).

Figure 82.2 Axial CT scan.

A CT scan of the same patient, acquired at the level of the terminal ileum following intravenous and oral contrast administration was performed. It confirms an acute inflammatory reaction centred on the terminal ileum and caecal pole with bowel wall thickening,
mucosal hyperenhancement and perinephric fat stranding with small volume pericolic
lymph nodes seen. There is no evidence of an inflammatory mass lesion or drainable
collection.
234

MRI is preferable for the long-term follow-up of Crohn’s disease patients, and has a high
sensitivity for disease evaluation without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. MRI
has good soft tissue contrast and provides further information to differentiate between
fibrosis and inflammation.1 This can dictate whether a patient continues medical treatment or requires surgery. However, MRI is expensive and time consuming to perform and
does not provide accurate mucosal detail obtained in a follow-through study.
Figure 82.3 is a single image from an MRI half Fourier acquisition single shot turbo spin
echo (HASTE) sequence of the same patient taken 6 months later, and demonstrates a
fibrotic stricture of the terminal ileum measuring approximately 6cm, with no evidence
of active inflammation.

Figure 82.3 Axial MRI image from HASTE
sequence.

Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory condition that can affect the bowel anywhere from
the mouth to the anus. Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, malabsorption and abdominal pain. Patients suffer from bowel strictures causing obstruction,
adhesion formation and fistulation, often resulting in surgery. As well as an increased
risk of malignancy, patients have a range of extraintestinal manifestations (Table 82.1).

235

KEY POINTS

• Fluoroscopy studies are still widely used in the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease but are
being superseded by MRI and CT techniques.

• CT is often performed in the acute setting to exclude other pathology, with MRI more
appropriate for long-term follow-up.

• Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory condition of the bowel with a wide range of
extraintestinal manifestations.

CASE 83:

A TOURIST FROM NEW ZEALAND

History
A 44-year-old woman attends the accident and emergency department with a painful leg.
She is a tourist on holiday, and flew in from New Zealand on a 23-hour flight arriving
2 days ago. Since landing in the UK, her left leg has developed an achy pain with associated swelling and erythema. It has become increasingly difficult to walk, and despite
analgesia with elevation of the leg her symptoms have not resolved. She is alarmed by
the swelling and attended hospital with near complete immobility due to the pain.
She is normally a fit and healthy individual with no significant medical history. Apart
from occasional homeopathic remedies for insomnia, she is taking no regular prescribed
medication other than the oral contraceptive pill.

Examination
On examination there is swelling of the left ankle, calf and thigh with marked tenderness
in the calf muscles and some tenderness medially in the thigh. There is some redness of
the leg. There is no knee joint effusion and peripheral pulses are present.
As part of her investigations, a lower limb ultrasound is organized with the radiology
department (Figure 83.1).

Figure 83.1 Ultrasound.

Questions
• What does this ultrasound image demonstrate?
• How does ultrasound work?
• What are the strengths and limitations of ultrasound?

237

ANSWER 83
This static image is a cross-sectional view of the superficial femoral vein (SFV) lying
adjacent to the superficial femoral artery (Figure 83.2). Fluid on ultrasound is normally
hypoechoic in appearance as demonstrated by the flowing blood within the femoral
artery. The intraluminal appearances of the adjacent vein are not anechoic, and return a
heterogeneous echogenic signal. Subsequent images demonstrate non-compressibility of
this SFV in keeping with a solid intraluminal venous component.

Echogenic thrombus within vessel

Figure 83.2 Ultrasound with echogenic thrombus indicated.

Figure 83.3 shows a longitudinal Doppler image of the same region with flow demonstrated within the femoral artery. The SFV again demonstrates an ill-defined heterogeneous echogenic appearance, and only a trace of flow is demonstrated.

Figure 83.3 Longitudinal Doppler image.
238

In summary, there is echogenic thrombus seen within the left SFV with reduced patency, compressibility and flow in keeping with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The possible complications are pulmonary embolism and post-phlebitic problems in the limb.
Anticoagulation is indicated. The risk factors in this case are the long flight and the oral
contraceptive pill. The oral contraceptive pill should be stopped, with appropriate contraceptive advice, and anticoagulation would normally be continued for 6 months with a
first thrombus and an identified precipitant.
Ultrasound is the use of sound waves to image the human body. The sound waves are
of such high frequency that they are inaudible to the human ear (e.g. 2–20 MHz). An
ultrasound probe is designed to convert an electrical signal into acoustic energy and does
so by utilizing the unique properties of piezoelectric crystals (most commonly microcrystalline lead zirconate titanate (PZT)). The ultrasound probe comprises a compressed layer
of PZT, which is coated in silver to allow electrical conduction. Passing an alternating
electrical current causes the PZT to expand and contract with the production of a sinusoidal sound wave of a particular frequency and wavelength. The shape of the ultrasound
probe and a rubber-coated window can focus the sound wave, allowing an operator to
control its direction.
The sound waves do not pass through the body freely, and tissues of differing density
cause the beam to be reflected back towards the probe. The degree of sound wave transmission through a tissue before it is reflected is dictated by the acoustic impedance of the
tissue through which it is passing. Subtle density changes (e.g. within soft tissue) cause
the reflected ‘echoes’ to return to the probe at different times. The returning sinusoidal
sound wave compresses the PZT, which converts the acoustic echo back into electrical
energy and allows complex computer programs to form a picture on the operator’s screen.
When there is a sudden density change (e.g. muscle to bone/muscle to gas) the majority
of the sound wave is either transmitted or reflected and no images beyond this density
interface can be generated. This limits the use of ultrasound in imaging the lungs or deep
to bone.
Each probe has a fixed frequency, with a higher frequency returning more echoes over
a period of time and forming an image of superior resolution compared to probes of a
lower frequency. Unfortunately, the acoustic impedance of higher frequency and shorter
wavelength sound waves, limits the depth they can travel. Higher frequencies are therefore recommended for the imaging of superficial pathology (e.g. a subcutaneous lump),
while deeper imaging (e.g. abdomen) requires a probe of increased wavelength, and the
reduced frequency allows only for an image of reduced resolution. As with many other
aspects of radiology (e.g. CT dose versus noise), image resolution and depth penetration
is a trade-off.
As an imaging modality that does not involve the use of ionizing radiation, ultrasound
is preferred, if appropriate, to CT or X-ray. Some of the strengths and weaknesses of
ultrasound are listed in Table 83.1.

239

Table 83.1 Strengths and weaknesses of ultrasound
Strengths
• No ionizing radiation: This is especially
important in the young people and pregnant
women

Weaknesses
• Operator dependent: Experience may dictate
a more accurate report

• Cheap: Compared to a CT or MRI scanner,
ultrasound machines are inexpensive

• Body habitus: It is more difficult to generate
a diagnostic image in larger people

• Readily available: No patient preparation or
other healthcare professionals required

• Density changes: Images are limited by
bone, bowel gas and normal aerated lung

• Real time: Allows for functional imaging
(e.g. contrast enhancement) and needle
guidance for biopsy procedures
• Portable: Ultrasound machines can be taken
to immobile patients (e.g. ITU)

KEY POINTS

• Ultrasound has a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of a DVT and carries no risk of
ionizing radiation exposure to the patient.

• Ultrasound assesses compressibility, patency and flow of the deep venous system.
• The major limitations of ultrasound are operator dependence and patient body habitus.

CASE 84:

SPONTANEOUS NOSE BLEEDS IN A YOUNG PERSON

History
A 14-year-old boy is referred to the interventional radiology department following an
ear, nose and throat (ENT) multidisciplinary meeting (MDM). He complains of a 6-week
history of epistaxis that has been increasing in frequency, currently with approximately
eight episodes of bleeding per day. No predisposing factors are to be found on history
and the spontaneous bleeds can occur at any time. The worst bleeds are at night and
he recently reports a single episode when he woke from sleep feeling as though he was
choking from a spontaneous episode of bleeding. At that time the bleeding lasted more
than 30 minutes and required hospital attendance for nasal packing. He has never needed
a blood transfusion.
Examination
On review by the ENT registrar on call at the accident and emergency department, initial
screening bloods were unremarkable but the patient was kept in hospital overnight for
observation. The next morning the nasal packing was removed and direct visualization
with a flexible nasendoscope revealed an area of friable soft tissue abnormality on the
right side. The patient was referred for a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)
scan, which revealed an avidly arterially enhancing soft tissue mass in the post-nasal
space with extension into the retroantral region. The pterygopalatine fossa was widened
and a diagnosis of juvenile angiofibroma was made with supply from the right sphenopalatine artery. The patient was discussed at the ENT MDM and referred for embolization
under the interventional radiologists (Figure 84.1).

Figure 84.1 Digital subtraction angiography.

Questions
• How was this procedure performed?
• How are catheters and sheaths sized?
• What embolization materials are available?

241

ANSWER 84
This case is designed to inform the reader of a few of the devices that are available to an
interventional radiologist and the application of them. It also highlights the importance
of having a good understanding of vascular anatomy and patient preparation.
The patient was admitted electively to the paediatric ward and the case performed under
general anaesthesia. The right common femoral artery was punctured under ultrasound
guidance with local anaesthetic cover by a micro-puncture needle. A 0.018″ Mandrel was
passed into the common iliac artery and a 4 French (Fr) sheath was inserted at the puncture site. A 0.035″ standard wire was passed into the aortic arch over which was passed
a directional catheter. The wire was exchanged for a 0.035″ hydrophilic angled wire and
the catheter/wire combination was used to selectively cannulate first the brachiocephalic
trunk followed by the common carotid and external carotid arteries. A selective handinjected angiogram was performed to characterize the vascular anatomy (Figure 84.2).

Maxillary artery

Endotracheal tube

Facial artery

Lingual artery

Figure 84.2

Having achieved a stable position with the guide catheter, a 2.8Fr microcatheter set was
used to cannulate the right maxillary artery and advance it for selective cannulation of
the sphenopalatine artery. Position was confirmed with angiography and embolization
was performed with 500–700μm polyvinyl acetate (PVA) particles until haemostasis was
achieved. There were no unexpected complications and post procedure the patient was
cared for by ENT with a successful outcome and no further epistaxis reported.
Catheters and sheaths (Figure 84.3) are the basic tools of an interventional radiologist,
and a good understanding of how their size is measured is essential for effective use of
a catheter/sheath combination. A sheath is used to secure vascular access and provide
stability for the safe passage and manipulation of a catheter through it. They are sized
242

Figure 84.3

according to the French gauge system (Fr) where 1Fr is 0.33mm. The bigger the French
size the larger the diameter, and this is not to be confused with the needle gauge system
where the diameter of a needle is 1/gauge (therefore the larger the gauge the smaller the
needle). The French size of a catheter refers to its outer diameter, while when referring to
a sheath the French size corresponds to its inner diameter. Therefore a 4Fr catheter will
pass through a 4Fr sheath.
Embolization procedures are minimally invasive and use the vascular channels of the
body to deliver a particular agent to the site of pathology. There are many embolization products on the market, and the most appropriate one is selected depending on the
outcome that needs to be achieved. They can be either permanent or temporary but are
grossly classified into four categories:
• Liquid agents: This is a form of liquid glue that can be injected via a catheter to flow
through complex vascular anatomy and solidify, thereby reducing arterial or venous
blood flow. They are commonly used in the treatment of arterio-venous malformations (AVMs).
• Particle agents: This type of embolization material is used in small arteries or precapillary arterioles. They come in a range of sizes (approximately 50–1200μm) and are
predominantly permanent. They have both a mechanical property and clump together
to reduce blood flow, but also deliberately induce inflammation to promote clotting.
The major disadvantage is that they carry a risk of unwanted distal embolization if
not targeted specifically within the blood vessel of choice.
• Coils: These are lengths of platinum or stainless steel that are extruded out of a catheter into a high-flowing blood vessel. They are designed to deliberately coil within
the vessel and often carry Dacron wool feathers, which slow blood flow causing a
mechanical clot and haemostasis. It is a form of permanent embolization and is commonly used in AVMs, testicular vein embolization and in uncontrolled haemorrhage.
• Plugs: This is a form of permanent embolization. The plug is appropriately selected for
size and then delivered to a vessel through a catheter in a collapsed form. Its delivery
can be highly accurate and it is re-expanded within the vessel before detachment to
cause a mechanical embolization.
KEY POINTS

• Optimal patient preparation and procedural planning is of paramount importance in
any interventional procedure.

• An excellent understanding of expected and aberrant anatomy is essential.
• In the French gauge system, 1Fr is equivalent to 0.33 mm in diameter.

CASE 85:

ABDOMINAL WEIGHT GAIN AND DISTENSION DESPITE

DIETING
History
A 44-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman has been referred for assessment. She complains
of gradual abdominal distension over the last few years. Until recently this was not
associated with abdominal pain outside of her normal menstrual periods, but over the
last month she has had a constant achy pain in her stomach. She denies any chance of
pregnancy and reports no change in her bowel habit. She has been gaining weight over
the last few years despite activity and dieting.
Examination
Examination reveals a distended but soft abdomen, with a fullness centrally that is tender on deep palpation. This has clear examination margins unrelated to other abdominal
viscera and does not move on respiration. Haematinic studies reveal a slight microcytic
anaemia with normal renal, thyroid and liver function parameters.
An abdominal ultrasound study organized by her general practitioner (GP) had demonstrated the presence of a large soft tissue/cystic mass extending up from her pelvis. The
patient was referred following an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study (Figure 85.1).

Figure 85.1 Sagittal T2-weighted MRI scan.

Questions
• What is this examination and what is the main abnormality?
• Can you classify the type of abnormality seen?
• How are these lesions normally diagnosed and treated?

245

ANSWER 85
Figure 85.1 is a T2-weighted image of the pelvis from an MRI study acquired in the
sagittal plane. There is a broad-based pedunculated lesion arising from the uterine fundus. This measures approximately 14.5×8.4cm in maximal dimensions and is of predominantly low signal intensity. Subsequent post-gadolinium imaging demonstrated avid
enhancement. When comparing it to neighbouring tissue types, the lesion has slightly
lower signal characteristics to the adjacent myometrium of the uterus, confirming the
diagnosis of a subserosal fibroid. A prominent leash of blood vessels around the right
side of the fibroid appears to feed the fibroid. The fibroid also contains a well-defined
unilocular central cystic component measuring 9.6×7.0cm. The fluid within the cystic
component is hyperintense on T1-weighted images, in keeping with haemorrhagic degeneration. The cystic component does not demonstrate any vascularity.
Uterine fibroids result from benign proliferation of the smooth muscle of the myometrium, and can therefore interchangeably be referred to as uterine leiomyomas. They
are the commonest gynaecological malignancy, and have an increased incidence in AfroCaribbean people with approximately 50 per cent of all women affected.1
Dependent on oestrogen for growth, it is unusual for women to be diagnosed with fibroid
disease in the post-menopausal period or before the age of 30 years, with the exception
of younger pregnant women where changes in the oestrogen : progesterone ratio can see
rapid fibroid growth in the first trimester. Fibroid size and multiplicity can vary, with the
commonest symptoms being pelvic pain, abdominal distension, dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia. Fibroids large enough to distort the uterine cavity can be responsible for infertility or miscarriage, and can also cause urinary frequency when pressing on the bladder
anteriorly. As a highly vascular tumour, if the fibroid size is such that it outgrows its own
blood supply, myxoid or haemorrhagic degeneration can occur as seen in Figure 85.2.

Figure 85.2 Axial T2-weighted MRI scan.

Their position in relation to the wall of the uterus allows for classification:
• Submucosal: Growth centred on the inner myometrium allows fibroids to project into
the uterine cavity.
• Intramural: The commonest subtype, with most patients remaining asymptomatic.
• Subserosal: Centred on the outer myometrium, these fibroids are exophytic and can
be pedunculated with increased risk of torsion or infarction.
246

The differential diagnoses associated with the symptoms of fibroid disease are wide,
and imaging is essential. Radiologists would advocate the use of ultrasound in the first
instance, as this is quick and easily accessible, with no radiation dose to the patient.
Optimal views of the uterus would be achieved with a transvaginal scan, although good
views of the uterus can be obtained transabdominally, ideally with a full bladder. The
role of computed tomography (CT) is limited and there is a significant radiation dose to
the radiosensitve pelvic organs.
On ultrasound, fibroids are usually seen as ill-defined rounded hypoechoic heterogeneous
lesions associated with distorted uterine architecture. The fibroids have similar ultrasound
appearances to the adjacent myometrium, and echogenic bands separating bundles of
smooth muscle can be delineated. The presence of calcification is common, demonstrated
by echobright foci within the fibroid with posterior acoustic shadowing. Doppler assessment can demonstrate avid vascularity.
MRI is the gold standard imaging modality for accurate fibroid characterization. It can
provide clear zonal anatomy for surgical planning and reliably exclude cystic or haemorrhagic degeneration. Imaging sequences of MRI are out of the remit of this case and
fibroids can have a variety of appearances, however, fibroids are classically of low signal
on T2-weighted images and iso- or hypo-intense to myometrium on T1-weighted images.
Calcium would appear low signal on all sequences, with fibroid degeneration appearing
as high signal on T2. The degree of haemorrhage, myxoid or cystic degeneration can be
variable and is best reviewed on T1 for characterization.
Until the mid 1990s, the only treatment available for symptomatic fibroid disease was
surgery in the form of myomectomy or hysterectomy. These procedures carry significant
morbidity and require an inpatient stay. As an alternative, interventional radiologists can
now offer uterine artery embolization (UAE) to appropriate patients. This is a minimally
invasive technique, with selective cannulation of both uterine arteries via a percutaneous
groin puncture of the external iliac artery. Under direct fluoroscopic vision, embolization
material is instilled to selectively thrombose the uterine artery and deliberately infarct the
fibroid. This reduces tumour volume and improves patient symptoms over time, hopefully
avoiding the need for aggressive surgery.

Figure 85.3 Uterine embolization.
247

KEY POINTS

• MRI is the gold standard examination for the assessment of uterine fibroid disease.
• Fibroid position in relation to the wall of the uterus allows for classification.
• Uterine artery embolization is a minimally invasive treatment option for fibroid disease.

CASE 86:

LEFT MID ZONE CRACKLES

History
A 35-year-old man is sent to the accident and emergency department by his general
practitioner (GP) after complaining of shortness of breath. The symptoms started 10 days
ago with a chesty cough, which has become productive of yellow/brown sputum over
the last week. He has also noticed increasing shortness of breath and reports a reducing
exercise tolerance to less than two flights of stairs. He is a smoker of 10 cigarettes per
week, with no relevant past medical or drug history.
On visiting the GP last week, some inspiratory crackles were heard on auscultation in
the left mid zone, and a diagnosis of a respiratory tract infection was made. He was prescribed a course of amoxicillin but his symptoms have not resolved. He attended the GP
today for follow-up and was referred to the accident and emergency department.

Examination
On examination he appears short of breath at rest with use of accessory muscles. His
temperature is 38.6°C and he complains of left-sided chest pain on deep breathing.
Auscultation reveals coarse crackles in the left mid zone. A sputum sample is green and
blood stained. A chest radiograph has been arranged for further assessment (Figure 86.1).

Figure 86.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the radiograph show and in which lobe is the pathology?
• Should we worry about the risk of radiation exposure if this patient needs follow-up
X-rays?
• Which radiological examinations carry the largest radiation exposure?

249

ANSWER 86
Figure 86.1 is an anterior–posterior (AP) chest radiograph of an adult male patient taken
in the erect position. It is adequately penetrated but slightly rotated to the right. There is
a patchy area of airspace opacification within the left lower zone that lies adjacent to the
left heart border obscuring the normal cardiomediastinal contour. Air bronchograms are
demonstrated in keeping with consolidation. They are caused by opacification of the lung
tissue around air-containing airways. The presence of a ‘silhouette sign’ and obscuration
of one part of the cardiomediastinal border can accurately localize the lung pathology
to a particular lobe. In a two-dimensional radiograph a cardiomediastinal border will be
lost when up against consolidated lung, but maintained when still lying adjacent to aircontaining lung. This is termed the ‘silhouette sign’. In this case, loss of the left heart
border with preservation of the hemidiaphragm is in keeping with the silhouette sign of
lingular consolidation. An annotated chest radiograph demonstrating the normal cardiomediastinal borders is shown in Figure 86.2.

For lingular consolidation amoxicillin would not be the appropriate antibiotic and following adequate treatment, if the radiograph changes fail to resolve, further investigations to rule out an obstructive lesion might be indicated.
Several different types of radiation are used in diagnostic imaging, but the principal
radiation source, and the one that a patient is regularly exposed to, is X-rays. There
is an understandable inherent fear of radiation exposure, but the risks associated with
radiation exposure are only realized when there is absorption of energy by living tissue.
High-energy beams that pass straight through a person with no absorption are harmless,
but absorption causes free radical formation which directly damages cell DNA/RNA, leading to cell death or transformation. Unfortunately, it is the absorption characteristics in
250

human tissues of differing densities that allow a diagnostic picture to be produced. The
use of ionizing radiation is therefore strictly controlled through government regulations,
most notably the Ionising Radiation (and Medial Exposure) Regulations (IRMER) 2000.
The effects of radiation can be seen either in the exposed individual (somatic effects)
or may be realized in the offspring of an exposed individual. These types of effects are
termed hereditary and can be either deterministic or stochastic:
• Deterministic: Effects of radiation exposure are only seen when the amount of radiation a patient is exposed to exceeds a certain level. Beyond this threshold, the likelihood of detrimental effects rapidly increases, but below it, no risk is inferred.
• Stochastic: These effects do not recognize a threshold dose, with the risks of cancers
and genetic abnormalities sharing a linear relationship with the degree of exposure:
the greater the exposure, the greater the risk.
The types of abnormality seen depend on the type of tissue exposed, with some organs
of the body being more radiosensitive than others, for example, the reproductive organs
or lens of the eye. It is also important to recognize that we are inherently exposed to
natural radiation every day, mainly from cosmic rays and radon decay. The average
dose to the UK population per year from these natural sources is approximately 2.2mSv.
Some areas of the United Kingdom have higher exposure (e.g. 7mSv in Cornwall) from
local geographical factors. We can use these figures as a benchmark to help assess the
risk of radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging when ordering an X-ray or computed
tomography (CT) scan. If the option of an imaging modality that does not expose the
patient to ionizing radiation is available and appropriate (e.g. magnetic resonance or
ultrasound), then this should be considered in the first instance. Radiation exposures are
listed in Table 86.1.

By thinking in terms of the number of equivalent chest X-rays a patient is exposed to
during a single study, a doctor can gauge the risk/benefit of different diagnostic investigations. Fluoroscopy studies carry the greatest dose, but are very operator dependent,
with variable degrees of radiation exposure. Although many barium investigations are
being replaced by CT studies (e.g. enemas), fluoroscopy activity is increasing overall with
the advancement of endovascular intervention techniques. CT is the ‘workhorse’ of a radiology department and carries significant radiation exposure risk. Although collimation
and dose-reduction techniques are improving, if possible, always consider an alternative
method of answering the diagnostic question. For example, if the patient is low risk, a
251

lower dose ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) study may diagnose a pulmonary embolism rather
than a CT chest.

KEY POINTS

• Formal chest radiographs are acquired in a posterior–anterior (PA) orientation.
• The silhouette sign can accurately locate pathology to a particular lung lobe.
• Always consider radiation dose to the patient when requesting a radiological
procedure.

CASE 87:

TRAUMATIC INJURY TO A FARMER’S FOOT

History
A 45-year-old farm worker is bought to hospital by his wife. While changing the wheel of
his tractor earlier today, the jack collapsed and the tyre landed on his left foot before rolling off. He felt an immediate sharp and stabbing pain which was exacerbated by walking.
His foot began to swell despite ice and elevation. Worried that he may have fractured a
bone they attended the minor injuries unit that evening.
He has no relevant past medical history but is a smoker of 20 pack-years.

Examination
Examination reveals a swollen left foot with bruising centred on the plantar arch. The
patient is in continued discomfort, with the medial aspect of the foot being most tender
over the first metatarsal. He is sent for a foot radiograph before further management is
planned (Figure 87.1).

Questions
• What injury does this radiograph show?
• What joint and ligament is involved?
• Why is it important to recognize this
injury?

Figure 87.1 Anterior–posterior (AP)
radiograph of foot.

253

ANSWER 87
In a normal anterior–posterior (AP) radiograph of a foot, the medial aspect of the second
metatarsal should align with the medial margin of the middle cuneiform. Figure 87.1
demonstrates an AP weight-bearing radiograph of the left foot. There is malalignment
of the Lisfranc joint, with a homolateral 3mm slip of the second to fifth metatarsals. No
obvious fracture is seen and the remaining bones of the mid- and forefoot are intact
and correctly located. These features are in keeping with a Lisfranc dislocation, and the
patient should be referred to orthopaedics for further management.
The Lisfranc joint separates the bones of the midfoot, comprising the cuneiform and
cuboid bones, from the metatarsals of the forefoot. Each cuneiform bone articulates with
its first, second and third metatarsal, respectively, with the fourth and fifth metatarsals
articulating with the cuboid bone. Stability of the joint is maintained by complex ligaments found on the plantar surface, which maintain alignment when weight-bearing.
These ligaments are subject to significant shear forces on every step a person takes, and
are put under increased pressure in athletes. The largest ligament is the Lisfranc ligament, which originates from the lateral aspect of the medial cuneiform bone, and inserts
into the medial aspect of the second metatarsal. It is primarily responsible for stability
of the whole joint, and maintains the plantar arch while preventing the second to fifth
metatarsals slipping laterally when walking.
Following injury, the Lisfranc ligament may either be stretched (Lisfranc sprain) or completely torn. Joint stability and alignment is lost, causing diastasis between the first and
second metatarsals and dislocation of the Lisfranc joint. Patients present acutely with soft
tissue swelling, plantar bruising and pain on weight-bearing. Special attention should be
given to those patients with sensory peripheral neuropathy (e.g. alcoholics and diabetics).
The injury is sustained either through longstanding repetitive strain placed upon the
ligament (e.g. athletes), or from a direct axial load forcing the foot downwards while in
rotation. The latter is often associated with bone fractures in combination with Lisfranc
dislocation. When suspected, a patient should be referred for orthopaedic assessment with
further imaging in the form of computed tomography (CT) to look for associated fractures (Figure 87.2), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess ligament integrity.
Without correction, normal biomechanics of the foot are lost, and the patient will develop
irreversible osteoarthritic change with eventual incapacitating disability on a background
of chronic pain.

Figure 87.2 Unenhanced coronal CT image
with bone windowing showing a bony
fragment in between the first and second
metatarsal bases indicative of a Lisfranc
ligament rupture.
254

Treatment differs between institutions and is determined by joint stability. In a sprain
where the Lisfranc ligament is intact, treatment is conservative with the foot immobilized
in a cast for 6 weeks. When the joint is unstable, surgery is required with the insertion
of screws and wires necessary to maintain reduction. The foot is immobilized in a cast,
and the patient is non-weight-bearing for 3 months. The screws are eventually removed
following satisfactory healing with clinical outcome dependent on restoration of normal
alignment.

KEY POINTS

• Bony misalignment can indicate ligamentous injury in the absence of bony injury.
• Two views of a bony joint, preferably at right angles to each other, should always be
acquired.

• Patients should be referred for an MRI or CT scan if there is suspicion of bony/
ligamentous injury.

CASE 88:

AN ACCOUNTANT WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
A 37-year-old accountant has been referred to your outpatient clinic by his general
practitioner (GP). He complains of vague abdominal discomfort, which is central, colicky
and intermittent. He has been having these symptoms for as long as he can remember
and was thought to have irritable bowel syndrome. They have recently been increasing
in frequency and his new GP decided to investigate them further. There are no predisposing factors and he has tried several dietary changes with no resolution of symptoms.
He denies any weight loss, change in bowel habit or vomiting, but suffered attacks on a
weekly basis now. The pain subsides spontaneously after a few hours with no sequelae.
There is no relevant past medical history. He does not take any regular medication and
denies allergy. He is a non-smoker, does regular exercise and lives with his wife and
child.

Examination
Nothing abnormal was found on examination. A set of blood results taken last month
are normal, and he has recently had a barium follow-through investigation (Figure 88.1).

Figure 88.1 AP image from barium follow-through study.

Questions
• Describe the barium study.
• What is the abnormality demonstrated?
• What are the complications of this condition?
257

ANSWER 88
This is a single anterior–posterior (AP) image from a barium follow-through study, centred on the abdomen and pelvis. There is good contrast opacification of the stomach
with normal distended appearances and no evidence of a filling defect. Barium is seen
to pass freely into the duodenum and jejunum on this 15-minute film, with no evidence
of stricture or obstruction. The pylorus and proximal duodenum are seen in the expected
position, but the opacified distal duodenum fails to cross the midline, instead remaining
on the right of the abdomen. The duodenal–jejunal (DJ) junction is abnormally located
within the right upper quadrant, with opacified jejunum appearing to continue on the
right side. Delayed images are required to see the position of the remaining small bowel
and caecal pole.
Figure 88.2 shows an image from the same patient taken at 80 minutes following ingestion of barium and demonstrated continuation of the entire small bowel to the right of
the midline. There is no evidence of stricture or obstruction. The caecal pole is located
within the pelvis, but is medial to its expected position in the right iliac fossa. The hepatic
flexure is abnormally positioned and lies within the left upper quadrant, with the entire
large bowel seen to lie on the left side of the abdomen. These features indicate a diagnosis
of malrotation.

Figure 88.2 Subsequent image from barium
follow-through.

During embryological development the primitive mid- and hindgut move out of the
abdominal cavity and normally rotate 270 degrees anticlockwise on a mesentery around
the central omphalomesenteric axis. This twisting movement allows the gut to pass under
the primitive superior mesenteric vessels as they form, before re-entering the abdomen.
The DJ flexure is then fixed to the base of the left hemidiaphragm by the ligament of
Treitz, and the caecal pole is secured in the right lower quadrant.
If the primitive gut is secured to a mesentry that is shorter than usual, the gut cannot
complete its full rotation, leaving the caceal pole and DJ junction in anatomically abnormal positions. This is termed ‘malrotation’, and is best diagnosed with a barium follow258

through study, to identify the abnormal peritoneal fixation from the position of the bowel
loops. On a CT scan, the position of the superior mesenteric vessels is reversed, with the
superior mesenteric artery (SMA) positioned to the right of the superior mesenteric vein
(SMV). Imaging studies demonstrate a variety of appearances depending on how much
of the 270 degrees the bowel rotated before fixation, with a right-sided duodenum and
jejunum being the commonest finding. Patients are often symptomatic as neonates and
children, suffering from recurrent abdominal pain, distension and vomiting. Failure of
the primitive gut to rotate at all results in the entire small bowel on the right side of
the abdomen with the large bowel on the left, as in this case. These patients with nonrotation often present as adults, and describe a history of mild intermittent abdominal
pain for as long as they can remember.
A short mesentry predisposes children to the complication of midgut volvulus. Most
commonly presenting in the first 3 weeks of life, children present with bilious projectile
vomiting and abdominal pain. This is a medial emergency and can lead to bowel infarction and death. Its characteristic features on a barium study demonstrate malrotation with
a spiralling ‘corkscrew’ appearance to the bowel distal to the obstruction (Figure 88.3).

Figure 88.3 Midgut volvulus.

KEY POINTS

• Oral contrast fluoroscopy studies have a high sensitivity for detecting malrotation.
• Normal embryological development involves a 270 degree anticlockwise rotation
around a central omphalomesenteric axis.

• On CT scans, check the position of the SMA in relation to the SMV in cases of
suspected malrotation.

PAIN IN A WOMAN WITH BREAST CANCER

History
A 57-year-old woman attends the hospital for a computed tomography (CT) scan. She
was diagnosed with breast cancer 3 years previously and was successfully treated with a
right mastectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Following breast reconstruction last
year, a routine CT scan demonstrated no assessable disease and the patient was offered
a clinic appointment for 6 months’ time. Recently she has noticed some increasing pain
the right upper quadrant of her abdomen and reported unexpected weight loss of over
2 kg. Informing her hospital consultant via telephone, the patient was asked to attend
hospital for a blood test and repeat CT scan of the chest and abdomen. She is due to see
the consultant in clinic tomorrow.
Examination
On the CT scan you find evidence of post-surgical change within the reconstructed right
breast with no assessable disease above the diaphragm. Abdominal review demonstrates
multiple areas of low attenuation within the liver, which are new compared to the previous CT, in keeping with hepatic metastases. Both kidneys are unobstructed and there is no
evidence of portal vein thrombosis. To complete the report, you review the bony skeleton
reconstructed in the sagittal plane for improved image interpretation (Figure 89.1).

scan.

Questions
• What does the CT scan demonstrate?
• What are the common tumour types that cause this appearance?
• What further radiographic investigations should be considered?

261

ANSWER 89
This image is a sagittal reconstruction from a CT scan centred on the lower thoracic,
lumbar and sacral spine. It has been windowed to improve bony resolution. It demonstrates multiple areas of well-defined reduced attenuation and loss of the normal bony
architecture throughout the vertebral column and sacrum with evidence of posterior element involvement. They have a narrow zone of transition and are surrounded by areas
of ill-defined sclerosis. The vertebral column retains a normal alignment and there is no
loss of vertebral body height to suggest vertebral collapse. Within the limits of this single
image, the cord appears capacious throughout, although review of the whole image series
is recommended. The findings are in keeping with multilevel lytic bone metastases.
Secondary bone deposits are approximately 100 times more common than primary bone
tumours.1 Spread from the tumour haematogenously, via the lymphatics or through direct
invasion, they have a predilection for parts of the skeleton with high marrow content,
affecting the axial skeleton more often than the ribs and skull. Their presence alters the
bone integrity, and patients are at increased risk of fracture despite normal physiological
loads being applied, known as ‘pathological fractures’. This is most marked in the spine,
where vertebral compression fractures can cause spinal canal stenosis from retropulsed
bone fragments, which can encroach on the spinal cord causing compression and neurological compromise. Spinal cord compression is a neurosurgical emergency.
Depending on cell type, tumour deposits upregulate either osteoclastic or osteoblastic
activity, giving characteristic radiographic appearances. Those metastases with osteoclastic activity cause bone lysis, with soft tissue deposits destroying the adjacent bone
and reducing the structural integrity. On X-ray, the bone can appear ‘moth-eaten’ and
destroyed, with pain being the commonest clinical symptom. Osteoblastic metastases
cause bone sclerosis, with new bone formation appearing as areas of increased density.
The involved bones retain their normal morphology, but the heterotrophic bone has
abnormal trabecular architecture, reducing the overall bone integrity. To confuse matters, some tumour types have metastases with both lytic and sclerotic components, and
lytic bone metastases become sclerotic following treatment (e.g. radiotherapy or chemotherapy). A few metastases can also cause characteristic bone expansion and the common
appearances are listed in Table 89.1.

Bone metastases are more likely to be multiple than solitary, and a combination of
modalities such as plain X-ray, CT and MRI are used to assess bony metastatic disease.
Bone scintigraphy, where radioactive phosphate particles are administered intravenously,
is often appropriate in characterization of disease distribution and treatment response.
262

The whole body is imaged, and the normal physiological bone appearances are disturbed
by areas of intense tracer uptake from sclerosis, or areas of photopenia from bone lysis.
It is highly sensitive with relatively low radiation exposure, and is useful to localize areas
of possible disease for further assessment.
Figure 89.2 shows a bone scintigraphy study from a patient with a prostate specific
antigen (PSA) of >2000, with increased tracer uptake seen in the skull, both shoulders,
shaft of both humeri and femora. There is also diffuse uptake of tracer noted in multiple
ribs bilaterally as well as in multiple vertebrae at multiple levels. The proximal tibia, pelvis and right sterno-clavicular joints are also involved. Both kidneys are not visualized
suggesting a ‘superscan’ consistent with extensive bone metastases from an underlying
diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Figure 89.2 Bone scintigraphy images.

KEY POINTS

• Bone metastases can be either lytic, sclerotic or mixed
• CT has a high sensitivity for resolving bony abnormality.
• Bone scintigraphy can be employed to assess the extent of bone involvement.

CASE 90:

HEADACHE AND VISUAL FIELD DEFECTS

History
A 48-year-old man has been referred by his general practitioner (GP) for further management. He complains of weight gain, tiredness and headache over the last few months
with no resolution of symptoms despite diet and analgesia. Initially thought to be stress
related, a screening blood test revealed normal biochemical markers other than a slightly
low T4, low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and low testosterone.
There is no relevant medical history. He is not taking regular medication and is a nonsmoker. Living at home with his wife and children, he has taken several sick days recently
because of his symptoms.

Examination
Examination reveals a tired looking Caucasian man in no obvious discomfort. His body
mass index (BMI) is 26 (previously recorded at 23). He is afebrile, normotensive and
with a regular pulse of 56 beats per minute. Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal
examination is normal. On neurological examination, visual field assessment reveals a
bitemporal hemianopia. A thyroid ultrasound scan and chest radiograph were normal,
and a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was arranged (Figures 90.1 and 90.2).

Figure 90.1 Unenhanced axial CT scan.

Figure 90.2 Enhanced sagittal CT scan.

Questions
• What does the CT scan show?
• Is there a differential for these appearances and what would you do next?
• What is the cause of the patient’s symptoms and biochemical abnormality?

265

ANSWER 90
The two images of the same patient are taken from a cranial CT study before and after
the infusion of intravenous contrast. The axial image (Figure 90.1) is unenhanced and
acquired at the level of the cavernous sinus. The patient’s head is slightly tilted to the
right. Within the suprasellar space there is a soft tissue mass measuring approximately
20×17mm which is well defined and isodense to the neighbouring brain tissue. It is of
homogenous attenuation and displays curvilinear rim calcification. It is expanding the
sellar turcica and splaying the cavernous sinus laterally. There is normal grey/white
differentiation and no evidence of acute haemorrhage. The second image (Figure 90.2)
is taken following the infusion of intravenous contrast and reformatted in the coronal
plane. The soft tissue mass demonstrates avid uniform enhancement centred on the pituitary fossa with suprasellar extension towards the optic chiasm and third ventricle. The
sella is expanded as before but there is no obvious breach of the sella floor or extension
into the sphenoid sinus. Within the limits of these images, the basal cisterns are preserved
throughout and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus or tentorial herniation.
The differential for a pituitary mass with suprasellar extension includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

pituitary adenoma;
carotid artery aneurysm;
meningioma;
pituitary metastasis;
pituitary lymphoma;
pituitary abscess;
Rathke’s cleft cyst.

From this differential list, pituitary abscess and Rathke’s cleft cyst can be discounted
as the pituitary mass is of homogeneous soft tissue density and the patient is not clinically septic or unwell. Pituitary metastasis and lymphoma are very rare and would be an
unlikely diagnosis considering there are no other systemic symptoms. The patient should
undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the mass further, with neurology/neurosurgery referral for outpatient follow-up (Figure 90.3).

Compressed
optic chiasm

Figure 90.3 T1-weighted gadoliniumenhanced coronal MRI image demonstrating
an enhancing pituitary mass lesion with
suprasellar extension. The arrow highlights the
compression of the optic chiasm. This requires
urgent surgical attention so as to preserve
vision.
266

This patient has a pituitary adenoma, which is a slow growing tumour of the anterior
pituitary gland. Despite being benign, patients are frequently symptomatic depending on
its size and functioning status. Pituitary adenomas are classified into macro- or microadenomas. Patients with pituitary microadenomas (<10 mm) often present with symptoms
of hormonal imbalance resulting from functionally active tumours, most commonly prolactin secreting with symptoms of amenorrhoea and infertility; instability of the adrenocortical, somatostatin and gonadotrophin axis can also occur.
In this case, the patient has a pituitary macroadenoma (>10 mm) with symptoms resulting from mass effect related to tumour bulk. Compression of normal pituitary tissue by
tumour has resulted in loss of TSH secretion and a clinically hypothyroid patient. In
addition, suprasellar tumour extension is causing compression of the optic chiasm and
stretching of the prechiasmic optic nerve. This is highlighted on the MRI study and is the
cause of the bitemporal hemianopia. With no intervention, the tumour will continue to
grow and he will be at risk of visual loss, obstructive hydrocephalus and carotid artery
involvement. This patient was referred to neurosurgery with successful tumour removal
and complete symptom resolution.

KEY POINTS

• The suprasellar space should be a review area when viewing unenhanced CT images.
• The use of intravenous contrast improves diagnostic interpretation.
• Always looks for optic chiasm compression in suprasellar masses.

CASE 91:

A CLAUDICANT WITH WORSENING LEG PAIN

History
A 71-year-old man is referred to the vascular surgical team with right leg pain. He is
known to suffer from atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease and is currently being
treated conservatively for claudication. The pain in his right leg started suddenly 3 hours
previously, with an achy discomfort that is not relieved by simple analgesia or positioning. Limited by pain, his mobility has reduced to only a few steps, and he reports increasing discoloration of his right foot compared to the left.
His relevant medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and angina.
He is an ex-smoker of 40 pack-years. His drug history includes aspirin, metformin, isosorbide mononitrate and a calcium channel blocker. He takes sublingual glyceryl trinitrate as required.

Examination
Having been treated by the accident and emergency department for his pain, examination reveals a mottled right foot and reduced popliteal and pedal pulses compared to
the left side. Femoral pulses are symmetrical and strong bilaterally, with no evidence of
an expansile pulsatile abdominal mass. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram is performed which suggests a right common femoral stenosis, and the interventional radiologists are approached for advice (Figure 91.1).

Figure 91.1 Lower limb angiogram.

Questions
• What type of study is this and what does it show?
• What treatment options are available in this case?
• What factors need to be considered when using radiographic contrast agents?
269

ANSWER 91
Figure 91.1 is a single view acquired during an angiogram of the lower limbs. It is a
procedure performed by the interventional radiologists on a fluoroscopy table, with the
patient in the supine position. With a sterile technique, a needle is passed into the common femoral artery (CFA) under ultrasound guidance and subcutaneous local anaesthetic
cover. In this case, a retrograde puncture of the left side was made to image the arteries
of both legs, however an antegrade puncture technique is sometimes preferable in certain situations. Adopting the Seldinger technique, a guidewire is passed via the puncture
needle into the aorta, and this is used to railroad a sheath and ‘pigtail’ multihole catheter.
Positioning the catheter at the aortic bifurcation, 15mL of contrast is pumped at 8mL/s
with digital subtraction images acquired of the opacified lower limb arteries.
A short tight stenosis of the mid superficial femoral artery on the right side is demonstrated, with the artery narrowed by approximately 80 per cent by a flow-limiting atherosclerotic plaque. There is a paucity of collateral vessels suggesting an acute obstruction.
There is good run-off of the distal vessels. Both superficial femoral arteries demonstrate
a background of mild atherosclerotic calcification.
Although surgery in the form of endarterectomy or bypass could relieve this stenosis, an
open operation would carry significant risk and leave the patient with a visible scar. An
endovascular repair through the left CFA puncture is preferable, leaving the patient with
only a small pinhole scar in the groin and conserving the tissues of the right leg.
Crossing the aortic bifurcation, the stenosis can be transgressed with an atraumatic
hydrophilic guidewire. This can then guide the passage of a balloon-mounted bare
metal stent to the level of the stenosis. Balloon inflation (Figure 91.2) compresses the
atherosclerotic plaque and delivers the stent to exert radial force and maintain continued
patency long term (Figure 91.3).
The post-procedure angiogram (Figure 91.4) reveals a good response to treatment with
improved blood flow to aid symptomatic relief. The sheath and catheter are removed and
haemostasis of the groin achieved by manual compression. The patient will require dual
antiplatelet therapy to aid stent patency.
Radiographic contrast media is used in all aspects of radiology to enhance tissue contrast
and improve diagnostic interpretation. Barium, water and air can all be used in certain
examinations (e.g. barium enema) but this is not suitable for intravenous usage in CT
and angiographic studies. Iodine, with its high atomic number, has strong photoelectric
X-ray absorption characteristics that make it ideal for use in intravenous contrast media.
Injecting a predefined volume and imaging at a specific time allows for tissue enhancement characteristics to be determined and improves the contrast between soft tissues
(Figure 91.4).
Before referring a patient for a study that involves the use of iodinated contrast, certain
parameters need to be checked. There are documented allergies to contrast media, and
also potential crossover in sensitive atopic individuals with shellfish and certain fruits
(e.g. strawberries). Contrast media is predominantly renally excreted and patients require
a degree of endogenous renal function to clear the injected contrast load. Intravenous
contrast is also nephrotoxic and can precipitate renal failure in predisposed patients. It
is important, therefore, to check a patient’s renal function prior to imaging to alleviate
this potential risk. Adequate hydration before and after the use of intravenous contrast
media is also recommended.

angiogram.

KEY POINTS

• Always review all imaging available before proceeding with an interventional
procedure.

• Stent insertion is avoided if possible at areas of flexion to avoid stent kinking.
• Always check a patient’s renal function before initiating the use of intravenous contrast.

CASE 92:

NORMAL VARIANT ON A CHEST RADIOGRAPH

History
Following her second year of foundation training, a 26-year-old junior doctor has
decided to spend a year in Australia gaining further experience. Having successfully
gained sponsorship by the Northern Sydney Central Coast Health Authority, she has to
be certified medically fit by a recognized senior physician to comply with immigration
policy. This involves completing a medical questionnaire, satisfying a medical examination, completing a series of screening blood tests and having a normal chest radiograph
with no evidence of communicable disease.
She feels well and has no relevant past medical history. Other than being an occasional
smoker there is no significant findings at history or physical examination.

Examination
Her blood results are as follows: white cell count (WCC) 9.4×109/L, Na 137mmol/L,
bilirubin 9 μmol/L, haemoglobin 11.6g/dL, K 4.2mmol/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
27IU/L, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 78fL, urea 4.1mmol/L, alkaline phosphatase
146IU/L, HIV negative, creatinine 87μmol/L, albumin 41g/L. Chest radiograph is shown
in Figure 92.1.

Figure 92.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What normal variant is found on this chest radiograph?

273

ANSWER 92
Figure 92.1 is a chest radiograph of an adult female patient. It is not rotated and there
is adequate penetration with optimal inspiratory effort made. The heart is of normal
orientation and size (cardiothoracic ratio 30/12 cm), with both hilar correctly positioned
with normal appearances. Cardiomediastinal assessment demonstrates a right-sided aortic arch. The lungs are clear and free from active disease. There is no evidence of old
Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure. Bone review is normal. There is no pneumothorax
or evidence of free air under the diaphragm.
Normal aortic anatomy: The aorta is divided into the ascending thoracic aorta, arch of
the aorta, descending thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta. The ascending aorta begins at
the aortic root running superiorly and anteriorly, adjacent to the right side of the sternum. It is enclosed with the pulmonary trunk in a sheath of serous pericardium and is in
continuation with the arch of the aorta. Lying behind the manubrium of the sternum, the
aortic arch runs superiorly, posteriorly and from left to right anterior to the trachea. The
arch gives rise to the brachiocephalic artery, left carotid artery and left subclavian artery
as it runs across the mediastinum to become the descending thoracic aorta. This descends
inferiorly as a posterior mediastinal structure, piercing the diaphragm at the level of the
twelfth thoracic vertebra and is in continuity with the abdominal aorta.
A right aortic arch is an embryological variant with persistence of the right arch and right
descending aorta while undergoing regression of the left side. Seen in approximately 2 per
cent of the western population, its course within the chest is to the right of the trachea
and oesophagus, crossing the midline in the lower thorax to pierce the diaphragm in the
anatomically correct position. Its incidence increases in congenital heart disease (e.g. tetralogy of Fallot), and is commonly associated with one of three aberrant vascular anomalies:
• Right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery: This is the commonest right
aortic arch anomaly and is associated with cardiac septal defects and coarctation. The
patient is usually asymptomatic but its positioning predisposes to aortic torsion in
adulthood. The left carotid artery is the first branch of the aortic arch with an aberrant
left subclavian artery arising from the proximal descending aorta.
• Right aortic arch with mirror image branching: As the second commonest right aortic
arch anomaly, this is caused by embryological interruption of the arch between the left
subclavian artery and the descending aorta, most commonly just distal to the ductus arteriosus. The great vessels branch opposite to the anatomicial norm, and patients are often
symptomatic, being strongly associated with cyanotic heart disease (e.g. truncus arteriosus).
• Right aortic arch with isolated left subclavian artery: In this third most common scenario, the aortic arch is interrupted between the left common carotid artery and the left
subclavian artery. The result is a left subclavian artery arising from the left pulmonary
artery, and the patient is symptomatic with congenital subclavian steal syndrome.
A right aortic arch is a normal anatomical variant. Having survived into adulthood with
no symptoms, it is highly unlikely that this incidental finding is of any clinical consequence. The student was passed fit to travel, and had a successful year in Australia.
KEY POINTS

• The normal aortic arch runs superiorly, posteriorly and from left to right anterior to the
trachea.

• A right-sided aortic arch is seen in 2 per cent of the population.
• There are often concomitant aberrant vascular anomalies with a right-sided aortic arch.
274

CASE 93:

FLANK PAIN AND HAEMATURIA

History
An intravenous urogram (IVU) study is requested on a 41-year-old man who has presented with right flank pain. His symptoms started 3 days ago with a dull pain on his
right side just below his ribs, which has remained constant and is not relieved by simple
analgesia. He attended his local accident and emergency department last night as the pain
woke him from sleep, and a presumptive diagnosis of a right-sided renal stone was made.
He was placed on appropriate analgesia.
He had no relevant medical history until last year when he experienced an acute but
short-lived pain on his left side while on holiday in Africa. Returning to the United
Kingdom, his general practitioner (GP) retrospectively diagnosed a renal stone and investigations showed a slightly elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone level. He is
currently being investigated for hypercalcaemia and further nuclear medicine studies are
scheduled next month.

Examination
His results today demonstrate a deterioration in renal function (creatinine 320 μmol/L)
compared to a normal baseline last month. His urine dipstick is positive for microscopic
blood but free from white cells and protein. On examination he is more comfortable following analgesia, but there is a pain on deep palpation and a fullness to the right side of
his abdomen compared to the left. The intravenous urograms are shown in Figure 93.1.

(a)

(b)

Figure 93.1 Intravenous urograms: (a) control; (b) 20 minutes post contrast.

Questions
• What does this IVU study demonstrate?
• What imaging modalities are available to characterize this type of problem?
• How should this patient be treated?
275

ANSWER 93
These are two images from an IVU study. The control film (Figure 93.1a) demonstrates a
solitary well-defined calcified focus measuring 12mm overlying the right pelvico-ureteric
junction (PUJ)/upper ureter. There is no other radio-opacity overlying the renal tracts and
both kidneys appear of equal size and shape. Post intravenous contrast administration
(Figure 93.1b) there is asymmetrical excretion of contrast, with normal appearances to the
left kidney and ureter, but delayed excretion and a persistent nephrogram on the right.
No contrast is seen within the right collecting system on the post-micturition 20-minute
film, suggesting a partially obstructed right renal system.
On delayed imaging at 4 hours (Figure 93.2), there is excretion of contrast into a dilated
pelvicocalyceal system, with the distal pelvis measuring approximately 11mm. There is a
faint trace of contrast seen within the right mid ureter, with additional contrast collecting in the bladder compared to the 20-minute post-micturition film. These findings are
in keeping with a partially obstructed right renal system, most likely caused by a renal
stone at the PUJ/proximal ureter.

Figure 93.2 Delayed imaging at 4 hours.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common cause of renal calcification with over 10 per cent of
the western population developing a stone by the age of 70 years.1 The majority of renal
stones (80 per cent) are made of calcium oxalate/calcium phosphate and are commonly
associated with primary and secondary hypercalcaemia. The remaining renal stones have
a mineral composition of either cystine or magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite).
Rarely, renal stones can be formed from either uric acid, xanthine or a mucopolysaccaride
matrix, and it is important to remember this, as these stones are radiolucent and therefore
radiologically invisible.
276

Other than an IVU, other imaging modalities include:
• Ultrasound: The renal stone is highly echogenic against the grey renal parenchyma,
with an acoustic shadow often projected deep to the stone. Ultrasound also carries a
high sensitivity of detecting pelvicocalyceal dilatation and does not expose the patient
to ionizing radiation. Its limiting factor is operator dependence. Small, non-obstructing stones may be poorly visualized due to renal pelvis fat, which is also echogenic.
• Computed tomography (CT): Non-contrast CT-KUB (kidneys, ureter, bladder) is the
gold standard and is highly sensitive for renal stone detection and characterization.
The radiation dose is low and exam time is short (less than 5 minutes), with no risk of
nephropathy as intravenous contrast is not required. Stone size, position and density
can be assessed to guide treatment (e.g. lithotripsy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy
(PCNL)). CT-KUB is replacing IVU as the preferred imaging modality for renal stone
disease.
• Nuclear medicine: There is a limited role for both MAG3 and DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) studies in cases of nephrolithiasis, with the stone appearing
as an area of photopenia on a background of homogeneous uptake. In an obstructed
system the studies are more useful and can demonstrate renal perfusion abnormalities
and can be used to compare the split function of both kidneys.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This modality has no significant role in the diagnosis of renal stone disease but may do in the future.
In this patient, an obstructed right renal system and deteriorating renal function needs
to have definitive treatment to decompress the renal pelvis and preserve right kidney
function. Options include a percutaneous nephrostomy inserted under fluoroscopy guidance by the interventional radiologists (see Case 71). However, the nephrostomy drainage
catheter can only remain in place for a limited time and this procedure carries risks of
infection and bleeding. The preferred alternative is a ureteric stent which can be placed
in a retrograde fashion during cystoscopy over a guidewire. The ‘double-J’ stents have
multiple perforations and can bypass the stone, allowing pelvicocalyceal decompression.
The ureteric stent can remain in place for up to 3 months while a definitive decision on
stone removal is made, and is then easily removed during a repeat cystoscopy procedure
when necessary (Figure 93.3).

Figure 93.3 Ureteric stent in place.
277

KEY POINTS

• The majority of renal stones are radio-opaque and are made of calcium oxalate/
phosphate.

• Non-contrast CT (CT-KUB) is the gold standard investigation for characterizing renal
stone disease.

• Obstructed and infected collecting systems require urgent decompression, usually via
nephrostomy insertion.

CASE 94:

PATIENT WITH AN INTRACTABLE HEADACHE

History
A 42-year-old woman is bought to the accident and emergency department by her
husband complaining of headache. Her symptoms started a few hours earlier with the
sudden onset of sharp stabbing pain at the back of her head. This rapidly progressed and
soon became the worst headache she had ever had. Despite simple analgesia and rest, the
headache did not subside and the pain caused her to vomit several times. There has been
no altered consciousness but her husband was concerned by her restlessness and agitation, and brought her to hospital.
The patient has a past medical history of asthma, which is well controlled on inhalers
provided by her general practitioner (GP). She also has annual review with the hospital
nephrologists for a history of polycystic kidney disease.

Examination
She is irritable and looks unwell. She is hypertensive (170/110) and has a regular pulse of
105 beats per minute. There is neck stiffness, and worsening of her headache on straight
leg raising but no focal neurology. Ophthalmoscopy is not tolerated and the patient asks
you to turn the lights off as they are hurting her eyes. A computed tomography (CT) scan
was performed (Figure 94.1).

Figure 94.1 Unenhanced axial CT scan.

Questions
• What does the CT scan demonstrate?
• Why was this patient at increased risk?
• What would you do if the CT scan had been normal?
279

ANSWER 94
This image is a single slice from an unenhanced CT scan taken at the level of the basal
ganglia. There is widespread abnormal high attenuation with a gyriform distribution
within both cerebral hemispheres. This high attenuation material is denser than adjacent
brain parenchyma but less dense than bone and represents acute blood. In the image,
arrows demonstrate acute blood replacing CSF within the Sylvian fissure (white arrow)
and quadrigeminal cistern (black arrow). There is mass effect with sulcal effacement
and the lateral/third ventricles are prominent in keeping with hydrocephalus. Some
acute blood is seen within the third ventricle at the expected origin of the aqueduct of
Sylvius. This patient has therefore suffered an acute subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)
with hydrocephalus.
Subarachnoid haemorrhage is defined as blood collected between the pia and arachnoid
mater. Clinically, patients with an SAH commonly present with an acute severe occipital
headache (‘thunderclap’) with associated vomiting, altered conscious state and agitation.
Unenhanced cranial CT demonstrates acute blood (white – HU 60–70) within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces. Large haemorrhages can be easily seen, but smaller bleeds can
be more difficult.
Causes of SAH include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

ruptured aneurysm,
AV malformation,
hypertensive haemorrhage,
haemorrhage from tumour,
intracranial infection,
blood dyscrasias, and
anticoagulation.

Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition,
which is slow to progress but has 100 per cent penetration in the affected individual.
Multiple thin-walled cysts form within native kidneys. Commonly causing pain, haematuria and proteinuria, unrestricted cyst growth replaces normal renal parenchyma, eventually causing renal failure. The patient is also at increased risk of developing renal cell
carcinoma. APKD has associations with cysts in other organs (e.g. liver and pancreas),
mitral valve prolapse and saccular ‘berry’ aneurysms of the cerebral arteries (3–13 per
cent).1 These aneurysms tend to be multifocal and rupture of any aneurysm causes blood
to leak into the subarachnoid space and SAH.
If the CT scan in a patient with this suspicious history had been normal, a lumbar puncture would need to be considered as a normal cranial CT does not exclude small SAH
(sensitivity 90 per cent).1 Lumbar puncture is essential to confirm the presence of normal
or altered blood (xanthochromia) within the circulating CSF that bathes the brain. Any
blood in the CSF space can cause obstruction and put the patient at risk of communicating/non-communicating hydrocephalus and death. Clinicians often feel reassured by
requesting a cranial CT to exclude the absolute contraindication of raised intracranial
pressure (ICP) before lumbar puncture to reduce the risk of ‘coning.’ However, cranial CT
is not a sensitive exclusion modality,2 and full clinical assessment looking for the stigmata of raised ICP would be advised.

280

KEY POINTS

• In an SAH, blood collects between the pia and arachnoid mater.
• An unenhanced CT scan needs to be performed in any patient suspected of having
a SAH.

• A normal CT scan does not exclude a small SAH or raised intracranial pressure.

CASE 95:

AN UNWELL PATIENT WITH A RASH

History
You are asked to see a 32-year-old Afro-Caribbean man who complains of feeling generally unwell for the last week. He has had a low-grade fever that has not resolved despite
bed rest and anti-pyrexial medication. He denies having a cough or any urinary symptoms and is usually a fit and active person. Over the last 2 days he has noticed a red rash
on his legs that is becoming increasingly hot and tender, and also complains of facial
swelling with an achy discomfort in his jaw. He has also had to stop wearing his contact
lenses as his eyes have become red and irritable.
Examination
On examination he looks tired with red conjunctiva and a temperature of 38.1°C. There
is smooth swelling of the parotids bilaterally with tenderness on palpation. His cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination is normal but there is an ill-defined
rash on the anterior aspect of both his shins that is raised, nodular and tender.
A full septic screen is performed and while the blood results are awaited, a chest radiograph is performed (Figure 95.1).

Figure 95.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the chest radiograph demonstrate?
• How could a diagnosis be confirmed?
• What are the extrathoracic manifestations of this disease?

283

ANSWER 95
This is a posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph of an adult male patient, which has
adequate inspiration, penetration and is not rotated. There is bilateral hilar enlargement with widening of the paratracheal stripe and loss of the normal convexity to the
aortopulmonary window. These features are in keeping with lymph node enlargement
and suggest the ‘1-2-3 sign’ of Garland’s triad. The lung parenchyma also demonstrates
pathology, with reticular nodular shadowing bilaterally in a mid and upper zone distribution with basal sparing. The nodules are small (<2 mm) and there is no evidence of
cavitation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart is of normal size and bone review
is unremarkable.
Taking account of the ethnicity, history and examination of this patient, the top differential for these appearances would be acute sarcoidosis (Lofgren’s syndrome). In the absence
of an infective cause, biochemical and radiological findings are helpful, although definitive diagnosis relies on obtaining tissue by procedures such as transbronchial biopsy at
bronchoscopy. The following should be noted:
• serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) can be elevated in normal individuals;
• on chest radiograph, as well as the typical features described above, a more chronic
picture can demonstrate parenchmyal volume loss and fibrosis, pleural effusions and
mediastinal/hilar ‘egg-shell’ calcification;
• high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) may be useful (Figure 95.2).

Figure 95.2 HRCT scan.

Although bilateral hilar adenopathy is the hallmark of this disease, the lung parenchyma
is involved in approximately two-thirds of cases. High-resolution (thin, 1mm) slices
confirm reticular shadowing related to thickening of the interlobular septae from the
interstitial lung disease. However, the presence and distribution of additional nodules is
key to the diagnosis. The nodules can vary in size (2–4cm) and are caused by lymphoid
hyperplasia related to the granulomatous response. Histologically, therefore, the nodules
have a peri-lymphatic distribution and follow the course of the arterioles and bronchioles and are termed ‘bronchovascular’ in distribution. The nodules are most conspicuous
284

along the thickened lung fissures, and give a ‘beaded’ appearance, which is demonstrated
in Figure 95.2 particularly along the oblique fissure of the left lung. HRCT features in
chronic disease can demonstrate fibrosis and loss of lung volume causing dilatation of
the distal airways. This is termed ‘traction bronchiectasis’.
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology, and although
thoracic manifestation is the commonest presentation, other organs are affected as
follows:
• Skin: Cutaneous plaques, nodules and scarring can occur and are collectively termed
‘lupus pernio’. More acutely, the patient can suffer from erythema nodosum where the
skin is red and hot with tender nodularity.
• Gastrointestinal: Plaques and nodular granulomas can cause mucosal fold thickening
anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. This is most commonly seen in the stomach,
followed by the colon, oesophagus and small bowel. Chronic involvement results in
stricture formation with luminal narrowing.
• Hepatobiliary: Upper abdominal viscera involvement primarily causes organomegally.
Late in the disease, granuloma formation can cause hepatic nodularity, however the
patients often remain asymptomatic.
• Bone: Osseous involvement is a radiologist’s favourite, most commonly affecting the
hands and feet. Granuloma formation within the bone medulla causes loss of normal
trabeculation resulting in a characteristic reticular ‘lace-like’ appearance. The overlying cortex demonstrates periosteal reaction and subperiosteal resorption mimicking
hyperparathyroid disease.
• Neurological: Although a rare entity of the disease, cranial nerve palsies are the commonest manifestation (e.g. bilateral VIIth) with cerebral granuloma formation infrequently presenting as a space-occupying lesion.

KEY POINTS

• The presence of Garland’s triad on a chest radiograph is highly suggestive of thoracic
sarcoidosis.

• Lung nodules demonstrate a bronchovascular distribution on HRCT.
• As a multisystem granulomatous disease, sarcoidosis can affect any organ in the body.

CASE 96:

CHEST WALL SWELLING AND A PLEURAL EFFUSION

History
A 58-year-old woman with a history of lung cancer has had a chest drain inserted for
resolution of a unilateral right-sided pleural effusion. Since its insertion, the patient has
noticed that the skin at the insertion site is continuing to slowly swell. This is exacerbated on coughing. She denies any shortness of breath or pain, and there is no evidence
of active haemorrhage.
Examination
Examination reveals an ill-defined fullness to the right lateral chest wall, which has
increased in size over the last few days. It is soft and compressible with nodularity felt
on light palpation. The clinicians are concerned about basal crepitations over the area
on auscultation with no evidence of a vascular bruit. The patient’s blood results are
unchanged from admission and a chest radiograph has been taken to assess positioning
of the chest drain (Figure 96.1).

Figure 96.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does this chest radiograph demonstrate?
• What are the common causes of this finding?
• How should the patient be treated for this condition?

287

ANSWER 96
Figure 96.1 is an anterior–posterior (AP) semi-erect chest radiograph of an adult female
patient. It is adequately penetrated with slight rotation. There is an intercostal chest drain
within the right hemithorax with its tip positioned at the right apex. There is a small
right-sided pleural effusion but no evidence of pneumothorax. The lungs are clear of any
consolidation or collapse and the cardiomediastinal boarders are within normal limits.
The soft tissues of the right lateral chest wall are expanded at the site of the chest drain
insertion with locules of low-density gas projected within a subcutaneous distribution.
These are confined to the right side with no cranial extension. These features are consistent with surgical emphysema of the right chest wall.
Surgical emphysema (also referred to as subcutaneous emphysema) occurs when gas collects within the subcutaneous tissues. It is able to track freely along the fascial planes,
separating the tissue layers and causing distension. This is an enormous potential space
and gas follows the path of least resistance limited only by the integrity of the overlying
skin. Without correction of the underlying insult, the patient can become very swollen in
appearance (Figure 96.2), with clinical examination revealing a unique ‘crackling’ sound
akin to having crumpled tissue paper under the skin. Separation of the tissue planes
is painless, with mild discomfort caused by increased skin tension and their bloated
appearance.

Figure 96.2 Chest radiograph showing
swollen appearance.

Causes include:
• Infection: In susceptible patients (e.g. people with diabetes) the presence of a gasforming organism under the skin will produce subcutaneous emphysema. When associated with tissue death, this gas gangrene requires surgical debridement to clear the
organism, most commonly Clostridium perfringens.
• Trauma: Any form of blunt or penetrating trauma that disrupts the parietal covering
of an air-containing organ (e.g. lung or intestinal tract) will form a conduit for air
to move into the subcutaneous tissues along a favourable pressure gradient. This is
most commonly seen in pneumothoraces associated with rib fractures or stabbings
where a shard of bone or the knife pierces the parietal pleura. During expiration, air is
forced into the subcutaneous space. Similarly, Boerhaave’s syndrome with a ruptured
288

oesophagus will cause a pneumomediastinum and air can track into the subcutaneous
tissues of the neck.
• Spontaneous: Patients with chronic lung disease (e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis) can suffer a spontaneous pneumothorax. If
associated with disruption of the visceral pleura, air will track via the mediastinum to
the subcutaneous space. This is also seen in intubated patients with barotraumas from
ventilation pressures.
• Iatrogenic: The commonest cause of subcutaneous emphysema is following medical
intervention or surgery. In the case described, the chest drain inserted for drainage
of a pleural effusion has formed a conduit with the subcutaneous space. Air from a
subclinical pneumothorax is leaking around the drain at the intercostal space and
accumulating in the adjacent tissue. This drain is appropriately sited, however a fenestrated chest drain that is incorrectly placed with some of the drain holes outside the
chest cavity will also cause subcutaneous emphysema. This is an important review
area when reporting chest radiographs following drain insertion.
Having removed the original insult, the treatment for surgical emphysema is conservative. Air within the subcutaneous tissues will be slowly reabsorbed over a few weeks with
no repercussions, but correction of the causative agent (e.g. pneumothorax) is essential
to prevent reaccumulation.

KEY POINTS

• Surgical emphysema occurs when gas accumulates within the subcutaneous tissues.
• Tracking along fascial planes, patients can become enormously distended and
uncomfortable.

• When placing a fenestrated chest drain, ensure all drain holes lie within the chest
cavity to avoid surgical emphysema.

CASE 97:

CHEST WALL DEFORMITY IN A PACEMAKER PATIENT

History
You are asked by a junior doctor to review the chest radiograph of an 80-year-old man
electively admitted for a pacemaker box change. Previously treated at another institution,
there are no radiographs available for comparison. The patient is medically well and does
not give a history of recent trauma. His past medical history includes previous syncope
related to heart block, and he recalls a series of operations in his 20s for the treatment
of tuberculosis.
Examination
On examination the patient is comfortable at rest with normal observations. Inspection
reveals a right chest wall deformity and signs consistent with previous surgery. There is
reduced lung expansion on the right, with reduced air entry at the apex and an area that
is dull to percussion compared to the contralateral side. A chest radiograph is performed
as part of the admission process (Figure 97.1).

Figure 97.1 Chest radiograph.

Questions
• What does the chest radiograph demonstrate?
• What is this procedure and why was it performed?
• What other methods of treating this disease were employed before drug therapy?

291

ANSWER 97
Figure 97.1 is a frontal chest radiograph of an adult male patient, which is of adequate
penetration but is rotated to the left. There is thoracic asymmetry, with a right-sided chest
wall deformity centred on the upper zone. There has been surgical removal of the first
five ribs on the right and corresponding transverse processes of the spine, with normal
appearances of the ipsilateral clavicle and scapula. The right lung apex demonstrates
volume loss from medialization and compression of the adjacent chest wall. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax and the changes appear chronic. Of note, there is a
dual wire cardiac pacing device and the left hemithorax has normal appearances. These
findings are characteristic of previous thoracoplasty for the treatment of pulmonary
tuberculosis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis was first described by Robert Koch in 1882. As an aerobic
bacteria, it has an affinity for the lung apices where there is a higher ventilation perfusion
ratio. The treatment for tuberculosis has radically changed over the last 100 years to the
current 6-month regime starting with four drugs. Before the introduction of drug therapy,
several methods of ‘collapse therapy’ existed, all with the common aim of reducing ventilation in the affected area. Thoracoplasty was practised until the 1960s, and an estimated
30000 procedures were performed in the UK between 1951 and 1960.1 Clinicians should
be aware of the characteristic chest appearances, as it is still practised today in developing
countries where the cost of chemotherapy is deemed excessive, and has been proposed in
extensively resistant disease. In India, 139 thoracoplasties were performed between 1992
and 1997.2 Cor pulmonale may result from the restrictive lung defect, particularly if the
residual lung is affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Thoracoplasty is commonly a three-stage procedure, with the ‘modern’ technique, as
described in 1949, involving the eventual removal of the first to seventh ribs with their
transverse processes and the angle of the scapula.3 The superior lateral chest wall is then
compressed towards the mediastinum, collapsing the affected upper lobe. Dewan et al.
document a 66 per cent success rate in modern-day practice.2
Although thoracoplasty was widely used, other causes of ‘collapse therapy’ include the
following:
• Pneumothorax: Forcibly introducing air into the pleural cavity, causing iatrogenic
collapse of the lung, was deemed in 1820 a ‘ray of sunshine in the dark history of
tuberculosis’.4 As the air was reabsorbed, frequent repeat procedures were necessary.
Pneumoperitoneum was used for disease at the lung bases.
• Internal pneumolysis: Visceral/parietal adhesions were internally cauterized under
direct vision with a thoracoscope before forcible pneumothorax collapse.
• Oleothorax: It was thought that the use of antiseptic mineral or vegetable oil instead
of air for forcible lung compression reduced the risk of tuberculous empyema and the
need for repeat procedure.
• Phrenic nerve crush: Paralysing the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm to the tuberculous
foci reduced oxygenation. Success was seen in lower lobe granulomas when used in
combination with pneumothorax techniques.
• Plombage: For patients unsuitable for external thoracoplasty compression or with
bilateral disease, a combination of inert paraffin and bismuth was injected into
the pleural cavity, forcibly compressing the adjacent lung. The use of inert Lucite
(poly(methyl methacrylate)) balls was a later development but had characteristic
appearances (Figure 97.2).
292

radiograph. Reproduced from Life in the Fast Lane medical

KEY POINTS

• Thoracoplasty for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is still
practised in developing countries.

• First to seventh ribs are often surgically removed with compression of the superior
lateral chest wall.

• Before chemotherapy, ‘collapse therapy’ was deemed a ‘ray of sunshine in the history
of tuberculosis’.

CASE 98: SUDDEN ONSET BACK PAIN IN A 72-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
History
A 72-year-old woman is referred by her general practitioner (GP). She complains of sudden onset of back pain while playing with her grandchild 6 weeks ago and although her
pain is now much better with analgesia, her symptoms have not resolved completely. She
denies any history of direct trauma. Her pain is aching in character centred on her thoracic spine with stabbing exacerbations on certain movements, limiting her mobility. She
does not complain of any numbness, tingling or pins and needles. She is able to walk and
move all four limbs independently with no complaints of bowel or bladder disturbance.
She has had no weight loss, change in bowel habit or any stigmata of infection.
Her past medical history includes bowel cancer 3 years ago treated with a right hemicolectomy. She has had no problems since.

Examination
She had a computed tomography (CT) scan performed 1 week ago as part of her continued surveillance. This did not report any evidence of local recurrence but did reveal an
abnormality on bone review (Figure 98.1).

Figure 98.1 CT scan.

Questions
• What does this image demonstrate and what type of image is it?
• What is a bone scan?
• What is the likely cause of this patient’s problems?

295

ANSWER 98
The image displayed in Figure 98.1 is a maximal intensity projection (MIP) of the lower
thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine, reconstructed in the sagittal plane. MIPs are a type
of post-processing technique regularly used in CT, and although MIP physics are out of
the remit of this answer, they allow for both 2- and 3-dimensional reconstruction for
improved diagnostic interpretation.
The image has been windowed to improve bony resolution. There has been collapse and
loss of height of T12 in its anterior aspect with relative preservation of the vertebral body
posteriorly in keeping with a wedge compression fracture. There is resultant kyphosis.
Coronal imaging (Figure 98.2) confirms uniform loss of vertebral body height anteriorly,
which is accentuated more on the right than the left.

Figure 98.2 Coronal image.

There are many causes of vertebral body collapse, with the most common being trauma,
malignancy and osteoporosis. Patients often complain of associated back pain and can
have neurological symptoms if there is bony encroachment of the adjacent spinal canal
with either cord or nerve compromise. The shape of the vertebral collapse can also be
seen to change the normal curvature of the thoracic spine, and in elderly people suffering
multilevel osteoporotic fractures, this can cause an overall loss of vertical height and a
severe kyphoscoliosis.
It is important to establish a cause for the vertebral collapse, so that steps can be taken to
prevent deterioration, multilevel involvement and a potential neurological deficit. Having
excluded a history of trauma, the main differential lies between loss of vertebral bone
integrity related to either malignancy or osteoporosis. Although it is impossible to say
with certainty that a vertebral collapse on CT is due to osteoporosis rather than malignancy, other radiological studies can be employed to help distinguish between them. A
bone scan can be very helpful and is discussed below, with a magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scan often performed not only to diagnose any evidence of neurological compromise, but to define characteristic features of acute vertebral collapse that can infer one
cause rather than the other. The infiltrative process of malignancy often causes diffuse
loss of normal bone marrow signalling on T1 imaging and post-gadolinium; abnormal
enhancement may be demonstrated with or without an associated epidural soft tissue
296

mass. As some fatty marrow is maintained in osteoporosis, associated vertebral collapse
often retains its concave posterior wall and is more likely solitary, as multilevel involvement is more in keeping with malignancy.
A bone scan (also referred to as ‘bone scintigraphy’) is a common type of nuclear medicine study that utilizes the normal physiological response to any bony insult, whether
it be malignant, infective or osteoporotic. The radiotracer technetium-99m is chemically
attached to methylene-diphosphate (MDP), and is preferentially taken up by osteoblasts
when intravenously injected into the body and incorporated into the matrix of healing
bone via hydroxyapatite deposition. Decay of this radioactive isotope is recorded on
a gamma camera and generates a skeletal image of normal physiological uptake with
‘hot-spots’ of radioisotope accumulation at sites of bony injury. Interpretation of the
distribution of tracer uptake can both imply an aetiology and also reveal other sites of
abnormality that were previously clinically invisible.
In the bone scan of the same patient, there is a focal region of increased tracer uptake to
the right of T12 and to the left of the lower lumbar vertebrae (Figure 98.3). Mild tracer
uptake is also noted at the shoulders, knees, ankles and feet. The appearances are suggestive of vertebral degenerative collapse related to osteoporosis in keeping with the
given CT images, however a solitary metastasis cannot be excluded. Tracer uptake in the
joints is suggestive of further degenerative disease. Multiple ‘hot-spots’ suggest skeletal
metastases have not been demonstrated.

Figure 98.3 Bone scan.

KEY POINTS

• CT scans have a high sensitivity at resolving bony pathology.
• If there is clinical suspicion of spinal cord involvement then an MRI study needs to be
performed. MRI can help differentiate between osteoporosis and metastatic collapse.

• Bone scintigraphy can reveal sites of bony involvement that are clinically invisible.

CASE 99:

CONSTIPATION AND COLICKY ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
A 78-year-old woman was transferred from the local nursing home complaining of
abdominal pain and vomiting. She has been suffering from intermittent colicky abdominal pain for several years with no clear exacerbating or relieving factors. The pain comes
on gradually, centred on the lower abdomen, and usually lasts a few hours before resolving spontaneously. It is often associated with nausea but never vomiting. She has been
extensively investigated with computed tomography (CT) and a colonoscopy, but these
were performed when the patient was asymptomatic and found no abnormality.
A typical episode started last night but the pain has failed to resolve by itself. She has not
passed any faeces or flatus for 12 hours and complains of abdominal distension. She has
a past medical history of hip replacements, diet-controlled diabetes and coronary artery
disease. She has a long history of constipation and has been on laxative treatment for the
last 20 years. She denies weight loss or recent change in bowel habit.

Examination
A plain abdominal radiograph was performed as part of the initial investigations (Figure
99.1).

Figure 99.1 Abdominal radiograph.

Questions
• What does this radiograph demonstrate?
• What is the diagnosis and is there a differential for these appearances?
• Can this affect other parts of the body?

299

ANSWER 99
Figure 99.1 is a plain abdominal radiograph of an elderly patient with a background of
degenerative bony change and bilateral hip replacements. There are dilated loops of large
bowel extending from the caecum round to the sigmoid colon with maximal bowel diameter of 7cm. The small bowel is decompressed and there is a paucity of gas within the
rectum. Centrally, there is an isolated loop of grossly dilated large bowel that assumes an
oval configuration centred on a linear density in the left lower quadrant. This is the characteristic ‘coffee-bean’ sign of sigmoid volvulus. There is no evidence of intra-abdominal
free gas to suggest bowel perforation (Figure 99.2).

Black line around sigmoid volvulus
Indicates mesenteric axis

Figure 99.2 Abdominal radiograph indicating mesenteric axis and
volvulus.

Volvulus is defined as twisting of the intestinal tract around a mesenteric axis. It is
relatively rare but most commonly seen within the colon where it accounts for one in
ten causes of large bowel obstruction. The mid- and hindgut is associated with a fold of
fibro-fatty tissue called the mesentery, which provides mechanical support and carries
nerves, blood vessels and lymphatics to the bowel. Anchored to the back of the abdominal
wall, those loops of bowel that lie furthest from the mesenteric root are more mobile and
can be susceptible to rotation. In the large bowel, the caecum and sigmoid colon are the
300

commonest sites of involvement, with predisposing factors including an unusually long
mesentery or chronic constipation.
Rotating around a mesenteric axis, the bowel twists and closes the lumen, causing bowel
obstruction. This can resolve spontaneously in response to peristalsis, with patients complaining of intermittent resolving abdominal pain. Failure to untwist the bowel will cause
bowel dilatation proximal to the obstruction with symptoms of pain, abdominal distension and vomiting. Patients may also have abdominal compartment syndrome because
of the mass effect from the dilated bowel loop. Blood vessels supplying the involved
segment of bowel are subject to strangulation, and this can lead to bowel ischaemia and
infarction. Without definitive treatment, this carries a high mortality.
Differentiating between caecal and sigmoid volvulus can be difficult on plain radiograph:
• Sigmoid is commonly seen in the elderly with plain film findings of an isolated
enlarged loop of large bowel centred on the left side with cranial extension towards
the diaphragm. A midline fold that represents the twisted mesenteric axis can be seen,
causing the characteristic ‘coffee-bean’ appearance (arrow). There is often associated
transverse and ascending colon dilatation, with normal small bowel calibre if the ileocaecal valve is competent.
• Caecal is a disease of the young (averaging 30 years) with the dilated caecum rotating
anteriorly and lying in the left upper quadrant. This is associated with small bowel
dilatation and puts the patient at increased risk of bowel perforation.
Other types of volvulus include the following:
• Gastric: Rotation of the stomach around the supportive gastrohepatic (lesser curve) or
gastrocolic (greater curve) mesenteries can cause sudden onset severe abdominal pain
and vomiting. It is considered a surgical emergency carrying up to 80 per cent mortality if treatment is not initiated quickly. There are two types: organoaxial (rotating
in a vertical axis, imaging reveals the characteristic appearances of a ‘mirror-image’
stomach with the greater curve within the right upper quadrant) and mesenteroaxial
(rotating along a horizontal axis, the stomach appears to be upside down with the
pylorus seen at the expected gastro-oesophageal junction).
• Midgut volvulus (described in Case 88): This is associated with congenital malrotation. Seen primarily in infants, the midgut rotates around the superior mesenteric
artery (SMA) axis, causing bowel obstruction and the characteristic ‘double-bubble’
sign on plain radiograph.

KEY POINTS

• Volvulus occurs when a loop of bowel twists around a mesenteric axis.
• Look for the characteristic ‘coffee-bean’ sign to help differentiate between a sigmoid
and caecal volvulus.

• Midgut volvulus is associated with congenital malrotation of the bowel.

CASE 100:

AN ANKLE INJURY

History
A 27-year-old woman attends the accident and emergency department one morning
unable to weight-bear on her right ankle. She had been out two nights before and consumed a large quantity of alcohol. She remembers falling, twisting her right ankle and
subsequently being unable to walk well. This had been painful over the course of the next
day and had kept her awake the previous night. She attended to check it was just a ‘sprain’.
Examination
She is unable to weight-bear on the right. Upon examination, the right ankle was swollen,
with reduced range of motion and there was bony tenderness upon bony palpation of the
lateral malleolus (distal fibula). She was neurovascularly intact distally, with foot pulses
and normal power/sensation in the foot. Radiographs were requested in the accident and
emergency department (Figure 100.1).

(a)

(b)

Figure 100.1 (a) Anterior–posterior (AP) and (b) lateral ankle radiographs.

Question
• What do the ankle radiographs demonstrate?

303

ANSWER 100
The radiographs (Figure 100.1a,b) demonstrate an undisplaced spiral fracture of the distal
fibula (lateral malleolus) demonstrated with arrows on Figure 100.2.

Figure 100.2

Ankle fractures are usually the result of low-energy twisting/torsion forces and present
with swelling, deformity and inability to bear weight. Non-displaced ankle fractures may
occasionally exhibit minimal swelling and no deformity.
Ankle fractures are one of the most common fractures treated by accident and emergency departments and comprise a range of different injury patterns, varying in severity.
Isolated malleolar fractures make up approximately two-thirds of ankle fractures, with
bimalleolar fractures occurring in a quarter, and trimalleolar fractures occurring in the
remaining 7 per cent of cases. Open fractures occur in approximately 2 per cent of cases.
The ankle is often thought of as a simple hinge joint, although biomechanically the axis
of rotation is constantly changing as the ankle allows variable degrees of rotation and
translation in the coronal and axial planes as well as the sagittal plane.
The ankle joint is formed by contributions from the tibia, fibula and talus. When the foot
is dorsiflexed, the widened anterior portion of the talus fits securely within the medial
and lateral malleoli and the talocrural joint acts as a true mortise with the bony structures
providing the majority of the stability. When the ankle moves into plantar flexion, the
304

narrower portion of the talar dome articulates between the medial and lateral malleoli,
where the talus does not fit as tightly (and the majority of the joint stability is conferred
by surrounding ligaments).
A number of methods of classification exist for ankle fractures, however it is most important to simply describe the fracture, in particular whether the fracture is open or closed,
the condition of the soft tissue (including swelling or blisters) and the bony structures
involved (in particular, is it unimalleolar, bimalleolar or trimalleolar?). Further points may
include the fracture pattern, amount of comminution and the status of the syndesmosis.
More systematized methods include the commonly used Lauge–Hansen Classification and
Weber Classification:
• Lauge–Hansen Classification: This is based on the fracture pattern. Each configuration is defined by two factors: the position of the foot (pronation or supination) and
the force applied to the ankle (adduction, external rotation or abduction). In addition
each configuration has a number of stages describing sequential injuries as the force
was applied, the most common mechanism being the supination–external rotation
pattern.
• Weber Classification: This is a simple system for classification of lateral malleolar
fractures relating to the level of the ankle joint and determining treatment. Fractures
are divided into three categories based on the level of the fibula fracture in relation
to the joint line (syndesmosis). Weber A fractures occur distal to the joint line, while
Weber B fractures involve the syndesmosis and Weber C fractures are confined above
the joint line. The fracture in this example would be an undisplaced Weber B fracture.

KEY POINTS

• Isolated malleolar fractures make up approximately two-thirds of ankle fractures.
• These injuries may only be seen clearly on one view of the ankle, therefore two views
are required in all cases of ankle trauma.

Knowledge and best practice in this field are constantly changing. As new research and experience broaden our
understanding, changes in research methods, professional practices, or medical treatment may become necessary.
Practitioners and researchers must always rely on their own experience and knowledge in evaluating and using
any information, methods, compounds, or experiments described herein. In using such information or methods
they should be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, including parties for whom they have a
professional responsibility.
With respect to any drug or pharmaceutical products identified, readers are advised to check the most current
information provided (i) on procedures featured or (ii) by the manufacturer of each product to be administered,
to verify the recommended dose or formula, the method and duration of administration, and contraindications.
It is the responsibility of practitioners, relying on their own experience and knowledge of their patients, to

Series editor foreword
The Crash Course series first published in 1997 and now, 16 years on, we are
still going strong. Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this
series relevant for today’s students is an ongoing process. These fourth editions
build on the success of the previous titles and incorporate new and revised material,
to keep the series up to date with current guidelines for best practice, and recent
developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and
student reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fourth editions, we have
completely re-written our self-assessment material to keep up with today’s ‘singlebest answer’ and ‘extended matching question’ formats. The artwork and layout of
the titles has also been largely re-worked to make it easier on the eye during
long sessions of revision.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles
on which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all
the information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate
basic medical science and clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance
between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient depth for those aiming
at distinction. The authors are medical students and junior doctors who have
recent experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the
material is checked by a team of faculty advisors from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Authors
The last five to ten years have seen many exciting discoveries and developments
in medicine. Some of these have remained in the laboratory and have not yet
filtered their way through to clinical medicine, but in other areas the fruits of
research are plainly obvious; take, for instance, the incredible proliferation of
monoclonal antibodies that are now available to treat a wide range of conditions.
The growth of evidence-based medicine has provided a vast database to draw
on, which is often distilled into guidelines such as those provided by the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Furthermore, this evidence has
led to a plethora of scoring systems used to calculate risk and to aid treatment.
However, what must be remembered is that taking an accurate history, being
able to trust your examination findings and communicating well with patients
remain of the utmost importance.
The ever-increasing depth of knowledge has led to even greater specialization, and
the volume of material is often daunting. In this edition we have tried to include
developments from the last few years without becoming too absorbed by minutiae.
Where guidelines are available we have included them in the further reading
section, so that more detail can be found if required. In addition we have
included some of the more recent review papers written in the major journals.
The practice exam questions should be enjoyable as well as testing, and we hope
that this book will serve students well as a revision guide from the start of
their studies to the end.

Oliver A. Leach and Gijs I. van Boxel

Faculty Advisor
The Crash Course in General Medicine is an invaluable revision aid for students
approaching their final medical exams. The rate of change in modern medicine
is staggering and to keep up to date with all aspects of such changes is virtually
impossible. This 4th edition, like earlier versions, provides a concise account of
a broad range of general medicine from the salient features of history taking
and clinical examination to investigations and further management. Useful links
to current national guidelines allow readers to ensure their knowledge is as
complete as possible. Crash Course will also be of great help to junior doctors
in their first years of clinical practice leading up to preparation for higher
professional exams.

Acknowledgements
First and foremost we would like to thank Richard for his guidance, expertise and
patience in the preparation of this fourth edition. We could not have asked for a
better faculty advisor. We would like to thank all the staff at Elsevier in the preparation of the manuscript, in particular Andrew, Helen and Nicola. We are grateful
to Dan for giving us the opportunity to be part of the institution that is the Crash
Course series.
I would like to thank Dr Paul Dennis and Dr Tim Lancaster for all their educational
hard work; this is a product of their passion for teaching medicine. Thank you to
Magdalen College Oxford, and in particularly Mr Simon Kreckler. Dr Mark Pobjoy
and Louise Robson, for their faith and support in my role as a tutor. Lastly, I would
like to thank my students, past and present, for keeping me on my toes. It is said the
best way to learn material is to teach it. This has certainly been the case for me; the
atrial waveform will haunt me for life.
Gijs I. van Boxel
Firstly, thanks to Tom for thinking of me for the Crash Course review, without
which I would not have had this opportunity. I would also like to thank Dr Jane Norman for offering her expert advice on the haematology chapter. Finally, thanks to
all those teachers and students who over the past few years have provided advice,
inspiration, and challenge.

Taking a history

1

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Take a history from a patient.
• Use open questions initially, followed by more specific questions based on your developing
differential diagnosis.
• Ask relevant questions for each organ system.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES: THE
BEDSIDE MANNER
Medical students are often told that ‘90% of the diagnosis is in the history’. Although there is a large amount of
truth in this statement, this is only the case if your
history-taking skills are accurate and relevant. This, in
turn, is largely dependent on your bedside manner
and the ability to build up a good rapport with your patient. There is no easy recipe for developing a good bedside manner but courtesy, patience and letting the
patient express their ideas, concerns and expectations
are essential ingredients. The mnemonic ‘PEAS’ (Pause,
Empathize, Acknowledge, Summarize) can be used to
remember the basis of good communication.
Whenever you meet a patient, introduce yourself politely and do not forget relatives or friends who may also
be present. Try to put the patient at ease, as visiting the
doctor is very stressful for most people, particularly if
they think that they have a serious illness. If you cannot
speak the same language, try to get an interpreter. If a
patient has hearing difficulties, sit closer, write things
down or speak louder!
The aims of the history are as follows:
• To establish rapport with the patient.
• To obtain an accurate, sequential account of the patient’s symptoms through open questions and create
a differential diagnosis.
• To ask specific questions to focus on the most likely
diagnoses.
• To determine risk factors for these possible
diagnoses.
• To put this problem or problems into the context of
the patient’s life.
This chapter provides a framework for taking a comprehensive history. However, the important thing is that you
develop an approach with which you are comfortable

and then practise it again and again. In this way you
will not miss things out and you will be able to concentrate more on what the patient is telling you rather
than what comes next. With experience you will recognize patterns and explore different avenues in the
history.
Make sure not to miss out on non-verbal clues, as facial expression and body posture can sometimes tell you
more than the words themselves. If you are looking up,
they will also feel that you are genuinely listening to
what they are saying. It is important to strike a good balance between recording the history accurately and
maintaining eye contact.
As a general principle, start the consultation by asking very open-ended questions, such as ‘How are you?’
or ‘What symptoms have made you come to the clinic
today?’ This gives the patient the opportunity to say
what they want. Then ask more specific questions to
clarify important aspects.
Try to take the history and then write it down afterwards; it enables you to listen and appear to be listening
without distraction, plus you can organize your
thoughts before committing them to paper. However,
when you are learning it may be easier to make notes
as you go along; you can also have prompts on your paper to enable you to fill in all sections. As you gain experience, you will find it easier to memorize the
patient’s history and write it down later.

THE HISTORY
At the start of every history you should always:
• Document the date, time and place of consultation.
This should be done on both sides and each subsequent sheet of paper. (Remember that the clerking is
a legal document.)
• Record the age, sex and occupation of the patient.

1

Taking a history
• Document who referred the patient and if they were
seen as an emergency.
• Document your name, grade and role (e.g. CT1 van
Boxel, Gen Surg SHO on call)

PRESENTING COMPLAINT (PC)
This is a sentence or short list explaining the reason the
patient has seen you today. Resist the temptation to
write the entire history in this section, particularly when
there are multiple symptoms; however, mentioning an
obvious background condition can be helpful (e.g. ‘One
week increasing shortness of breath and productive
cough. Background: 10-year history of COPD’).

HISTORY OF THE PRESENTING
COMPLAINT (HPC)
This is where the presenting complaint is explored in
great detail. It is impossible to describe a system that will
work for all complaints in every situation. You will need
to develop your own techniques, likes and dislikes. Inadequate relevant detail in this section is the commonest problem in medical student histories:
• Aim to obtain a coherent, sequential chronological
description of the events leading to the consultation.
• Ask the relevant questions to the symptoms (e.g. for
pain, ‘Where is it?’, ‘What is its character?’)
• Keep the differential diagnoses for a symptom in
your mind and seek evidence to confirm or refute
them.
• Use the review of symptoms questions for the system
you suspect to fill in extra detail (e.g. if the complaint
is a cough, ask about dyspnoea, pain, sputum, etc.,
and record it in the presenting complaint).
• Ask about the relevant risk factors (e.g. if pulmonary embolus is suspected ask about immobility,
travel, etc.).
• Recapitulate the history back to the patient, as this
helps cement the story in your mind and reassures
the patient that you are listening.
• If the history is long, or vague, using the opening
question ‘So when did you last feel well?’ gives a platform to begin from.
• Seek collateral history from witnesses, friends or
family where necessary (e.g. after a seizure). It is always worth asking the patient first whether they
mind you speaking to family or friends.
• With chronic complaints, it is vital to ask about how
the symptoms are affecting the patient’s life.
• Document relevant negative findings (e.g. headache,
but no photophobia or neck stiffness).

2

Finally, ask if they have any thoughts or worries as to
what the diagnosis might be; this can be very enlightening and will help you build a good working relationship
as you will be addressing their concerns. What the doctor is interested in and what the patient is interested in
can be diametrically different.
HINTS AND TIPS
If the patient presents with pain, the SOCRATES
principle is a useful framework for remembering to ask
all the relevant information: Site, Onset, Character,
Radiation, Associated features, Timing, Exacerbating/
relieving factors, Severity.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
Ask the patient if they have had any previous operations
or medical problems. It is prudent to probe a little about
each illness and how the diagnosis was made. Lists of
past history are commonly and sometimes wrongly carried forward from one hospital visit to the next. Record
the history in chronological order and, where possible,
record the year, hospital and consultant involved for
each episode. Many patients may forget past illnesses,
particularly if anxious, and it is worth developing a
routine to ask them specifically about diabetes, hypertension, angina or heart disease, rheumatic fever, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma/emphysema/bronchitis,
jaundice, stroke or transient ischaemic attacks.
HINTS AND TIPS
MJTHREADS is a useful mnemonic for remembering to
ask about specific medical conditions: Myocardial
infarction, Jaundice, Tuberculosis, Hypertension,
Rheumatic fever, Epilepsy, Asthma, Diabetes, Stroke.

MEDICATIONS AND ALLERGIES
(DHX)
Record which medications the patient is currently taking, how often and at what dose. If the prescribed medications are not being taken, ask why. Ask if there have
been any recent changes in medication. Always ask what
drugs the patient has taken in the past. For example, a
patient with pulmonary fibrosis as a consequence of
amiodarone may well have stopped taking it years before! Finally, ask about any non-prescription medications that may be obtained from a chemist or health
food shop.

Systems review
Does the patient have any allergies to any medications or anything else at all, no matter how trivial? If
yes, what was the exact nature of the reaction? Was it
anaphylaxis or did they experience a rash? It is worth
asking about penicillin directly as many patients state
they have a penicillin allergy but on closer questioning, they may describe a non-specific symptom and
a beta-lactam antibiotic can be given safely if the need
is there.
If the patient says they have no allergies it is traditional to write ‘No known drug allergies’ (NKDA).

FAMILY HISTORY (FHX)
Do any diseases ‘run’ in the patient’s family – in particular
ischaemic heart disease, cancer, diabetes and autoimmune disorders? Record illnesses in close relatives, including age of death where relevant. Generally speaking,
family members affected before the age of 60 are deemed
to be relevant. Drawing a family tree can be helpful in
some patients.

SOCIAL HISTORY (SHX)
The importance of this part of the history is to establish
how the illness affects the patient’s life and how they are
coping at home. Ask about:
• Who is at home? If they have a partner, are they fit
and well?
• What is the home like? If the patient is elderly, is
there a warden?
• If the patient is disabled, have appropriate modifications been made?
• Do they need help with daily tasks, such as washing,
dressing, feeding, cleaning or shopping?
• Do they have dependent children? Who is looking
after them at the moment?
• Is there a nearby relative who helps or does the patient have meals-on-wheels, a home help or a district
nurse?
• What is their occupation? Details of their past and
present occupation can be important (e.g. industrial
lung disease).
• Are they still able to work despite the current
problem?
• Some diagnoses can be particularly important in relation to work, such as heavy goods vehicle drivers
and epilepsy.
• Do they, or did they, smoke? Smoking is a significant
cause of many diseases. Record smoking in pack/
years
• Alcohol past and present. Record as units per week
(Fig. 1.1).

1

Units of alcohol

1 unit =

=

2/ small glass
3

of wine

=

1/ pint of beer,
2

lager or cider

1 small measure
of spirit

Fig. 1.1 Units of alcohol. These refer to a standard pub
measure of wine (12% alcohol by volume), a small pub measure
of spirits (40% alcohol by volume) and standard strength
beer (3–4% alcohol by volume). An easy way to work out
the units for a drink is to remember that the alcohol percentage
is equivalent to the number of units in one litre of the drink
(e.g. a litre of 40% whiskey contains 40 units and a 330-mL
bottle of 6% lager contains 2 units).

• Do they use ‘recreational’ drugs? These have health,
social and financial implications.
• Have they recently been abroad? They may have
been exposed to different infective agents.
• Do they have pets (particularly budgerigars, pigeons
and parrots)?
• Sexual history is not appropriate in every history but
may be important (e.g. for hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)).

SYSTEMS REVIEW
Patients occasionally focus on one minor symptom
while omitting to tell you of another more significant
symptom. In fact, this can be a deliberate act, asking
the doctor to deal with a simple problem (e.g. sore
throat) while deciding whether to ask for help with
the real worry such as impotence or rectal bleeding. Performing a quick systems review will prevent you from
missing other important diseases.
Alternatively, if the symptoms are multiple and nonspecific, a review of systems can shine light on the consultation and aid a differential diagnosis.
The symptoms to ask about in each system are outlined below. This list cannot be exhaustive and some
symptoms are repeated as they cross organ systems
though with different emphasis.

General symptoms
Fatigue
This is a non-specific symptom that can accompany
many organic as well as psychiatric diseases. Look particularly for evidence of anaemia or hypothyroidism.

3

Taking a history

Appetite

Cardiovascular symptoms

Anorexia is a feature of many diseases, again organic
and psychiatric; increased appetite despite weight loss
is seen in hyperthyroidism. Distinguish between reduced appetite, nausea or dysphagia

Chest pain

Weight change

Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) and
exercise tolerance

Weight loss can be deliberate (dieting) or due to chronic
disease. The causes are discussed in detail in Ch. 12.
Weight gain is seen in pregnancy, hypothyroidism,
Cushing’s syndrome, polycystic ovarian disease and
‘comfort eating’ due to anxiety or depression.

Sweats
Drenching sweats occurring at night are seen in lymphoma, chronic leukaemia and tuberculosis. This is
commonly referred to as B-symptoms (and addition
to weight loss and fever).

Pruritus (itching)
Pruritus can be due to local skin disease or systemic
disease, as shown in Fig. 1.2.

Sleep pattern
If there is difficulty in sleeping, ask if the problem is in
going to sleep or in waking early. Difficulty in getting off
to sleep is often due to worry or anxiety, whereas early
morning wakening is a feature of depression. Sleep apnoea is common and can be debilitating as hypersomnolence limits daytime function. The commonest
medical condition affecting sleep is obstructive sleep apnoea (see Ch. 30). Ask about snoring, whether sleep is
refreshing, morning headaches and restless leg movements. The patient’s partner is often the best source of
information.
Fig. 1.2 Causes of pruritus.

4

Cause

Examples

Skin
disease

Scabies, eczema, lichen planus, urticaria,
dry skin (elderly, hypothyroidism)

Systemic
disease

Hepatic (biliary obstruction, pregnancy)
Malignancy (particularly lymphoma)
Haematological (polycythaemia, iron
deficiency)
Chronic renal failure
Drugs (sensitivity, opiates)
Endocrine (diabetes mellitus, hyper/
hypothyroidism, carcinoid syndrome)
Parasitic (trichinosis)
Neurological (multiple sclerosis)
Psychogenic

Establish the site, radiation, character, exacerbating and
relieving factors, and severity; discussed in detail in Ch. 4.

Exertional dyspnoea can be due to poor left ventricular
function, pulmonary oedema, arrhythmia or valvular
disease (see Ch. 30).
Orthopnoea is breathlessness on lying flat, usually
from increased pulmonary venous congestion. This
symptom can be present in diaphragm palsy and even
in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as diaphragmatic input to ventilation is less efficient when the
patient is lying flat.
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND) is waking
during the night due to severe breathlessness (pulmonary oedema).
Sudden onset of breathlessness, irrespective of body
position or exercise, is often due to arrhythmia, pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism (see Ch. 5).
Taking a relevant exercise tolerance history is important. Ask the patient whether they can walk up a set of
stairs (in one go, without being out of breath once upstairs) and how far they can walk on the flat. Remember
that joint problems may be the limiting factor rather
than cardiorespiratory reserve.

Blackouts (syncope)
Syncope is the transient loss of consciousness and motor tone, which may be due to arrhythmia, valvular
heart disease, postural hypotension or vertebrobasilar
insufficiency (see Ch. 22).

Palpitations
Palpitations mean different things to different people and
they should be explored carefully as they may be insignificant or they may be life-threatening. Most commonly
they refer to awareness of one’s heart beating (see Ch. 6).

Ankle and calf swelling
This can be due to right ventricular failure, low plasma
oncotic pressure (e.g. decreased albumin levels) or drugs
(e.g. calcium channel blockers), or it can be gravitational.
Calf swelling can be due to:
• Deep vein thrombosis: recent travel, immobility or
surgery, pregnancy, combined oral contraceptive
pill, family history, malignancy.
• Ruptured Baker’s cyst: in the elderly, secondary to osteoarthritis of the knee.

Systems review
• Muscle trauma.
• Cellulitis.
• Tumour: sarcoma (rare).

Calf, thigh or buttock pain on exertion
(claudication)
Intermittent claudication due to peripheral vascular disease causes calf, thigh or buttock pain on exercise. The
amount of exercise required to cause pain tends to be
consistent although it often deteriorates slowly. It is relieved within a predictable period of time on rest.
Spinal claudication due to spinal stenosis also causes
calf, thigh or buttock pain on exertion, possibly by causing occlusion of the spinal arteries. However, the claudication distance tends to be variable.

Respiratory symptoms
Dyspnoea
Clarify the degree of dyspnoea and its consequences
for everyday tasks; try and separate respiratory dyspnoea
from cardiac causes though there is much overlap
(see Ch. 5).

1

Hoarse voice
This may be caused, for example, by recurrent laryngeal
nerve palsy in bronchial carcinoma.

Gastrointestinal disease
Abdominal pain
Establish the site, radiation, character, exacerbating and
relieving factors, and severity. This is discussed in detail
in Ch. 14.

Dysphagia
Dysphagia means difficulty in swallowing. Ask about:
• The onset and progression of symptoms
• Where do things get stuck? This may give a clue as to
the site of the lesion.
• Is there difficulty with solids, fluids or both? Neuromuscular disorders tend to present with dysphagia
for fluids at onset, whereas mechanical obstruction
results in dysphagia for solids at onset.
The causes of dysphagia are outlined in Fig. 1.3.

Cough

Fig. 1.3 Causes of dysphagia.

The causes of cough are multiple. Associated features
will help in developing a sensible differential diagnosis
(see Ch. 7).

Disorder

Examples

Oropharyngeal
lesions

Pharyngitis, quinsy, lymphoma

Intrinsic
oesophageal
and gastric
lesions

Peptic stricture
Carcinoma of oesophagus or gastric
fundus
Foreign body
Oesophageal web (Paterson–
Brown–Kelly or Plummer–Vinson
syndrome)
Infection (Candida albicans)
Pharyngeal pouch
Schatzki’s ring (lower oesophageal
narrowing)
Leiomyoma of oesophageal muscle

Extrinsic
oesophageal
compression

Goitre with retrosternal extension
Intrathoracic tumours (lymphoma,
bronchial carcinoma)
Enlarged left atrium

Neuromuscular
disorders

Achalasia
Scleroderma
Diffuse oesophageal spasm
Diabetes mellitus
Myasthenia gravis
Myotonia dystrophica
Bulbar or pseudobulbar palsy, e.g.
motor neurone disease or stroke
Diphtheria

Psychological

Globus hystericus

Sputum
How much sputum is produced? Ask about its colour,
texture and time course:
• Yellow/green: usually infection, acute asthma (due
to eosinophils).
• Frothy: pulmonary oedema.
• Rusty: lobar pneumonia (pneumococcal).
• Blood: pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, pneumonia (see Ch. 7).
• Taste: foul in bronchiectasis and abscess.
• Smell: foul in bronchiectasis.

Chest pain
Needs a careful assessment of character, position, timing, precipitating factors, etc. Chest pain is usually pleuritic in respiratory disease (Ch. 4) and is potentially due
to pneumonia, pneumothorax or pulmonary embolus.

Wheeze
Patients with airways obstruction sometimes notice an
audible expiratory wheeze.

5

Taking a history

Nausea and vomiting
What does the vomitus look like?
• Yellow-green: upper gastrointestinal (GI) contents
plus bile.
• Brown (faeculant): lower small bowel contents.
• Bright-red blood: active upper GI bleeding (Ch. 10).
• ‘Coffee grounds’: ‘old’ upper GI bleeding.
How ‘violent’ was the vomiting? Projectile vomiting indicates pyloric stenosis, most commonly seen in infants,
but may arise as a consequence of duodenal ulceration
in adults.

Indigestion
‘Heartburn’ or ‘dyspepsia’ is due to reflux of the gastric
contents into the oesophagus. Be aware that heartburn
can easily be confused with cardiac chest pain. Always
explore these symptoms carefully.

Change in bowel habit or stools
Has there been a change? Ask about diarrhoea and constipation, or the presence of one alternating with the
other (see Ch. 11).
Is there any rectal bleeding? Is the bleeding with or
without mucus? The causes of rectal bleeding are summarized in Fig. 1.4. Anal and rectal lesions result in fresh
blood on the outside of the stool, on the paper on
wiping, or in the pan. Higher lesions result in blood
intermixed with the stool. Melaena implies upper GI
bleeding and the passage of altered blood originating
proximal to the hepatic flexure.
Inquire about tenesmus. Tenesmus is the painful desire to defecate when there is no stool in the rectum. This
is due to a lesion in the lumen or wall of the rectum
mimicking faeces.

asked about directly and may even be evident on clinical
examination through scratch marks. Jaundice may indicate liver impairment and bruising and should therefore
be asked about directly as clotting factor biosynthesis
may be impaired.

Abdominal swelling
Ask whether the patient has noticed a change to the size
of their abdomen (be careful not to offend patients by
assuming they have an acutely distended abdomen!).
Remember the 7 F’s: Foetus, Flatus, Fat, Fluid, Flipping
great mass, Faeces and Full bladder.

Genitourinary symptoms
Dysuria
This is discomfort during or after micturition due to urinary tract infection or recent urethral instrumentation
(catheter or cystoscope).

Change in urine appearance
What does the urine look like?
•
•
•
•

Cloudy: infection, precipitated urates or phosphates.
Frothy: proteinuria.
Orange: very concentrated urine, bilirubin, rifampicin.
Red/smoky: haematuria, haemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, rifampicin, ‘black water fever’ due to haemolysis in Plasmodium falciparum malaria, eating
beetroot.
• Dark on standing: porphyria.
• Green: drugs containing methylene blue (commercial analgesics).
See Ch. 16 for the causes of haematuria and proteinuria.

Frequency and nocturia

Jaundice and itch

Increased frequency of micturition can be due to:

Jaundice can be insidious or acute and the patient may
therefore not have noticed it. Ask family or friends
whether they have noticed a change in skin colour. Itching is caused by build-up of bile salts in the skin and is a
feature of obstructice jaundice (see Ch. 13). It can be

• Bladder irritation: infection, stones, tumour.
• Outflow obstruction: prostatic hypertrophy, urethral stricture.
• Neurological: multiple sclerosis, cauda equina
syndrome.

Fig. 1.4 Causes of rectal bleeding.

Haemorrhoids
Anal fissure
Carcinoma (anus, rectum or colon)
Polyps
Diverticulitis (including Meckel’s diverticulum) but not
diverticulosis
Colitis (infective, ulcerative, Crohn’s, ischaemic)
Angiodysplasia

6

Note that, in polyuria, there is an increased volume of
urine as well as frequency of micturition.
Nocturia can be due to any of the causes of polyuria
(see Ch. 15) and increased frequency.

Hesitancy
Hesitancy followed by a poor stream with terminal
dribbling are features of prostatic enlargement. These
symptoms are often associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy, but could indicate carcinoma of the prostate.

Systems review

Loin pain
This can be associated with renal disease (Ch. 14).

1

• Dysphasia: difficulty in understanding or expressing
language, caused by lesions affecting the dominant
cerebral hemisphere (usually the left).

Incontinence

Fig. 1.5 shows the characteristic speech abnormalities
that result from lesions at specific anatomical sites.

This can be either urge incontinence (e.g. detrusor instability) or stress incontinence (e.g. weak pelvic musculature following childbirth). It can be functional, as
people with mobility problems may not be able to get
to the loo quickly enough.

Limb weakness, paraesthesiae
and sensory loss

Menstruation
Determine the pattern of the normal cycle. Then ask
about flow (heavy or light), intermenstrual bleeding,
postcoital bleeding or dysmenorrhoea.

Discharge
Vaginal or penile discharge can indicate infection.

Neurological symptoms
Headache
This is a difficult symptom for the doctor, with the diagnosis ranging from the trivial to the fatal. Ask about red
flag symptoms (see Ch. 18).

Dizziness

These are covered in detail in Ch. 34.

Metabolic and endocrine
symptoms
Symptoms associated with metabolic and endocrine
problems are varied and multiple – these symptoms are
described in detail in Ch. 35. The two most common endocrine conditions to consider and ask about are disorders of the thyroid (Fig. 1.6) and diabetes (Fig. 1.7).

Musculoskeletal symptoms
Weakness
This is covered in detail in Ch. 34.

Pain
Pain can arise in the muscles (Ch. 24), joints (Ch. 19),
or bones (Fig. 1.8).

This can also be unsteadiness (Chs 22 and 26).

Stiffness

Blackouts

Stiffness, particularly after inactivity (e.g. early morning
stiffness), is a feature of inflammation.

See Ch. 22.

Visual disturbance
Vision can be affected by lesions of the optic pathway, of
the nerves controlling eye movements (third, fourth,
sixth) or conjugate gaze.

Altered hearing

Joint swelling
This can be caused by infection, inflammation, blood
(haemarthrosis) or crystal deposition.

Disability
How do the symptoms affect lifestyle? This is extremely
important in patients with rheumatological diseases.

Ask about deafness, tinnitus and vertigo (Ch. 27).

Skin symptoms

Altered smell

Rash

Anosmia can result from head injury, nasal polyps, following viral upper respiratory tract infections or frontal
lobe tumours.

The distribution may be very helpful in determining the
diagnosis (Ch. 21).

Speech disturbance
There are three types of disordered speech:
• Dysarthria: difficulty in articulating speech but language content is completely normal.
• Dysphonia: difficulty in voice production.

Pruritus
For the causes of pruritus, see Fig. 1.2.

Precipitants
Has there been any recent change in detergents, soap,
shampoo, etc.?

CONCLUSION OF HISTORY
TAKING
The way to become skilled in history taking for both
clinical practice and examinations is to try and clerk
as many patients as you can with the range of listed presentations. It is important to write these up with a list of
diagnoses and a plan, then practise presenting to other
people. Then ask yourself how you could do it better
next time.

1

HINTS AND TIPS
At the end of the history ask two questions:
‘Is there anything else you are worried about or
want to tell me?’ It is possible that the patient may now
feel ready to tell you about their main concern.
‘Is there anything that you are worried this might
be?’ There is often visible relief when this question is
asked and it enables you to address the patient’s real
feelings about their illness.

HINTS AND TIPS
Good history taking is not easily taught or learnt the
night before an examination. It is acquired through
experience, lots of it!

HINTS AND TIPS
Be careful not to label a patient’s symptoms as
‘functional’. All organic causes must be ruled out before
making this diagnosis – it is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Examination of the patient

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• How to perform a thorough physical examination smoothly while being able to focus on the findings.
• The anatomy and pathophysiology underlying physical signs and their interpretation.

INTRODUCTION
When it comes to examining patients, practice really
does make perfect. Examiners will be able to tell
whether you have examined many patients or not
within the first 30 seconds of seeing you in action!
Therefore, take every opportunity you have to rehearse
your technique. Let others watch you examine and critique. These could be your teachers, fellow students, and
even patients can give you valuable feedback.

FIRST THINGS FIRST
There are four essential things you must do whenever
you see a patient:
• Introduce yourself, wash your hands, shake hands
and explain to the patient what you would like to
do and why, thereby obtaining their consent for
the examination.
• Ask the patient to move into the position required
for the system you are looking at, expose the area
concerned and then make sure that the patient is
comfortable and that their privacy is respected and
modesty maintained.
• Ask the patient if they have any pain. A good phrase
to use is ‘Are you in any pain currently? If I cause you
any discomfort during my examination, please let
me know and I will stop immediately’.
• From the moment you first see the patient, try to decide whether they look well or ill. There is plenty of
time while an examiner introduces you to the patient, and while the patient undresses and gets on
to the couch, for you to gain a lot of information.
You will probably find that all clinical teachers will
show you a slightly different format for examination
technique. The important thing is to develop an approach that you are comfortable with and then keep
practising it until it becomes second nature.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00002-6

In examinations you will almost always be asked to
examine a particular system: ‘Examine this gentleman’s
chest’, ‘What do you notice about this lady’s face?’ This
chapter describes the technique for each system and
how to interpret the clinical signs you will find. Of
course, once qualified, you should do a full examination for all your patients.

VISUAL SURVEY
It is accepted practice that all clinical examinations are
performed from the right-hand side of the patient.
The most important thing is to decide is how well or
ill the patient is, as described above. Other specific
abnormalities should then be looked for.

Patient position, general behaviour
and around the bed
Is the patient comfortable? Are they anxious? Are they
breathless? Are they in pain? Can they see? Are they
deaf? Can the patient walk? Are there any handy clues
around the bed (diabetic drinks, wheelchair, nebulizer,
catheter, oxygen, drains)? Taking time to assess these
factors has several advantages: it will help you with
the diagnosis, it helps to prioritize your approach as a
practising clinician, and it will calm your nerves in clinical examinations.

Cyanosis
This is a bluish discoloration which is seen when the absolute concentration of reduced (deoxygenated) haemoglobin in the blood is greater than 5 g/dL. Central
cyanosis is seen best in the tongue. It is caused by underlying respiratory or cardiovascular disease. Peripheral
cyanosis can be due to either central cyanosis or reduced
peripheral circulation, as poorly perfused peripheral tissue will take up oxygen more readily. Remember that a

11

Examination of the patient
patient with central cyanosis is always peripherally cyanosed, yet peripheral cyanosis can occur in the absence
of central cyanosis. Reduced peripheral circulation is
seen in shock, cold weather and vascular abnormalities.
Cyanosis is seen rarely in anaemia but occurs more readily in polycythaemia.
Very rarely, other forms of reduced haemoglobin,
such as methaemoglobin or sulphaemoglobin, can
cause cyanosis.

Jaundice
Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin, sclera and
mucous membranes due to serum bilirubin concentrations greater than 30 mmol/L, which becomes more
obvious at concentrations greater than 50 mmol/L.
Jaundice can be due to increased bilirubin production
(prehepatic), abnormal bilirubin metabolism in the
liver (hepatic) or reduced bilirubin excretion (posthepatic) (see Ch. 13). It is much easier to see in natural as
opposed to artificial lighting.
Yellow skin (particularly palms and soles) with normal sclera can be due to carotenaemia (excessive consumption of carrots, or hypothyroidism) or uraemia.

Chronic illness may be associated with pigmentation, common examples being chronic liver disease,
chronic uraemia or chronic haemolysis.
As well as Addison’s disease, local areas of pigmentation may be seen in Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (brown
lesions around the lips) and neurofibromatosis (café
au lait patches).
Localized areas of depigmentation, particularly
affecting the back of the hand and neck, are seen in
vitiligo. It may be associated with other autoimmune
diseases.

THE FACE AND BODY HABITUS
Examiners will often take you to a patient and simply
ask ‘What is the diagnosis in this patient?’ or ‘What
do you notice about this patient’s face?’ The conditions
in Fig. 2.1 are often known as ‘spot diagnoses’ – they
have characteristic physical features and often come
up in examinations.

Fig. 2.1 Common ‘spot diagnoses’.

Pallor

Disease

Examples

Generalized pallor can be racial, inherited (albinism) or
due to anaemia, shock, myxoedema or hypopituitarism.
Localized pallor is seen in disruption of the arterial
supply, as in Raynaud’s phenomenon.

Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism,
acromegaly, Cushing’s syndrome,

neurofibromatosis, Osler–Weber–
Rendu disease (hereditary
haemorrhagic telangiectasia) herpes
zoster, pemphigoid/pemphigus,
necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum

Hydration
Signs of dehydration include dry mucous membranes,
tachycardia, postural hypotension and reduced skin turgor. If the patient is in hospital, hydration status should
be monitored more accurately using urine output, fluid
balance charts and central venous pressure (if very ill).
Overhydration can sometimes result from the overenthusiastic administration of IV fluids, particularly in
the elderly. Clinical signs include pulmonary or peripheral oedema, raised jugular venous pressure (JVP) and
a third heart sound.

Pigmentation
Generalized pigmentation is usually of racial origin but
may also arise in haemochromatosis (greyish-bronze),
occupational exposure (slate-grey appearance with
argyria in silver workers) and with some drugs (slategrey with amiodarone).
Pigmentation may also be raised with increased
ACTH levels, as in Addison’s disease, Cushing’s disease
(ACTH-secreting pituitary tumour), ectopic ACTH production and Nelson’s syndrome (following bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing’s disease).

12

All these ‘spot diagnoses’ have characteristic physical signs.
SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

The hands

Fig. 2.3 Causes of hypoalbuminaemia.

THE HANDS
The hands can provide a wealth of information for the
alert clinician. When you are asked to examine the
hands, consider the normal structures present and examine them in turn. Where appropriate, go on to examine
the functional use of the hand (e.g. undoing a button or
picking up a pen). This is particularly important in
neurological abnormalities and destructive arthritides
(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).

Hands
• Blue: peripheral cyanosis.
• Pallor: anaemia (skin creases) and Raynaud’s
phenomenon.
• Pigmentation: Addison’s disease (skin creases).
• Depigmentation: vitiligo.
• Palmar erythema (Fig. 2.2).

Nail
• Koilonychia: spoon-shaped nails seen in iron
deficiency.
• Leuconychia: white nails due to hypoalbuminaemia
(Fig. 2.3).
• Clubbing: loss of the nail bed angle. The causes are
shown in Fig. 2.4.
• Splinter haemorrhages: terminal lesions usually due
to trauma, proximal lesions found in infective endocarditis and vasculitis.
• Quincke’s sign: capillary pulsation in the nail bed
due to aortic regurgitation.
• Beau’s lines: horizontal grooves in the nails caused
by temporary arrest of nail growth as a result of acute
severe illness.
• Onycholysis: separation of the nail from the nail bed
as a result of psoriasis, trauma, fungal infection and
hyperthyroidism.
• Yellow nails: yellow nail syndrome with lymphatic
hypoplasia (peripheral oedema and pleural
effusions).

Causes

Examples

Reduced intake

Malnutrition

Reduced synthesis

Liver disease

Increased utilization

Chronic illness

Increased loss

Nephrotic syndrome (kidneys)
Protein-losing enteropathy (gut)
Severe burns (skin)

• Half-and-half nails: the proximal nail is white and
the distal nail is brown or red as a result of chronic
renal failure.

Tendons
• Xanthomata: hypercholesterolaemia.
• Dupuytren’s contractures (thickening of the palmar
fascia): associated with alcoholic liver disease, epileptics treated with phenytoin, vibrating tools and
familial and idiopathic causes.

Joints
• Destructive arthropathy: e.g. rheumatoid arthritis.
• Heberden’s nodes: osteophytes of the distal interphalangeal joints.
• Bouchard’s nodes: osteophytes of the proximal interphalangeal joints.

Neuromuscular
• Localized wasting: ulnar or median nerve lesions.
• Generalized wasting: C8/T1 anterior horn cell, nerve
root or brachial plexus damage, combined median

and ulnar nerve damage, disuse atrophy in severe arthritis, profound cachexia.
• Myotonia: failure to relax after voluntary contraction. It is seen in myotonic dystrophy, for instance,
after shaking the patient’s hand.

Other signs
• Sclerodactyly (tightening of the skin causing tapering
of the fingers): look also for calcinosis, Raynaud’s
phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility (ask the
patient if they have difficulty on swallowing) and
telangiectasia – hence CREST syndrome.
• Large hands with doughy swelling: acromegaly
(often called spade-like hands).
• Asterixis: a coarse flapping tremor seen when the
hand is outstretched with the wrist extended and
fingers apart. It is caused by metabolic encephalopathy
(e.g. liver failure, carbon dioxide retention, uraemia).
• Action tremor: this is rapid and fine in amplitude. It
is worsened by holding the hands in a particular posture (e.g. hands outstretched) or by movement. It is
characteristic of benign essential tremor, thyrotoxicosis and excessive caffeine intake and is an exaggeration of physiological tremor.
• Resting tremor: the thumb moves across the tips of
the fingers. This ‘pill-rolling’ tremor is worst at rest
and is characteristic of parkinsonism.
• Intention tremor: this is absent at rest, present on
maintaining a posture and exaggerated by movement. It is characteristic of disorders of the cerebellum and its connections.
HINTS AND TIPS
When examining the hands, always look at the elbows
for a psoriatic rash, rheumatoid nodules or gouty tophi.

THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

General inspection
•
•
•
•

Does the patient look well or ill?
Are they lying flat?
Are they cachectic (cardiac cachexia)?
Is there evidence of a congenital syndrome associated with cardiac abnormalities such as Marfan’s
syndrome or Down’s syndrome?

Position
Help the patient to adopt a comfortable position at 45
with the chest exposed. In women, cover the chest until
ready to examine the praecordium.

14

Hands
• Clubbing: subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) and
congenital cyanotic heart disease.
• Cyanosis: peripheral vasoconstriction, pulmonary
oedema and right-to-left shunt.
• Splinter haemorrhages: SBE.
• Janeway’s lesions: non-tender macules in the palms
due to SBE.
• Osler’s nodes: painful nodules on the pulps of the
fingers due to SBE.
• Quincke’s sign: aortic regurgitation.
• Xanthomata:
hypercholesterolaemia
(vascular
disease).

Radial pulse
• Rate: normally between 60 and 100 bpm (see Ch. 6).
• Rhythm: regular or irregular (see Ch. 6).
• Radioradial delay: dissecting thoracic aortic
aneurysm.
• Radiofemoral delay: coarctation of the aorta.
• Character: best determined by palpation of a larger
artery (e.g. brachial or carotid arteries).

Blood pressure
• Level: hypertension is a risk factor for vascular
disease.
• Lying and standing: postural hypotension.
• Right and left: left may be lower than right in aortic
dissection.
• Wide pulse pressure: in the elderly and aortic
regurgitation.
• Narrow pulse pressure: aortic stenosis.
• Pulsus paradoxus: exaggerated fall in pulse pressure
during inspiration resulting in a faint or absent pulse
in inspiration; caused by severe asthma or cardiac
tamponade.

Brachial and carotid artery
• Character: collapsing (Fig. 2.5), slow-rising (aortic
stenosis), bisferiens (mixed aortic valve disease),

alternans (severe left ventricular failure), jerky (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy).
• Corrigan’s sign: prominent carotid pulsation due to
aortic regurgitation.

Jugular venous pressure
When assessing JVP, the patient should be at 45 with
their head resting on a pillow (this relaxes the sternocleidomastoid muscles). Pulsation should be up to
3 cm above the sternal angle (8 cm above right atrium).
Differences between JVP and carotid pulsation in normal subjects are shown in Fig. 2.6. JVP acts as a manometer for right atrial pressure and is raised when right
atrial pressure is raised (Fig. 2.7). Abnormalities in the
waveform result from specific underlying pathologies
(Fig. 2.8).
Restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis
and pericardial tamponade are all associated with
Kussmaul’s sign (JVP rises during inspiration).
HINTS AND TIPS
If the JVP is not visible at 45 , try sitting the patient
upright, laying the patient flat and eliciting the
hepatojugular reflux, as it may be either too high or too
low to be seen.

Right ventricular failure
Volume overload (over-enthusiastic IV fluids)
Superior vena caval obstruction (JVP is non-pulsatile)
Tricuspid valve disease (stenosis and regurgitation)
Pericardial effusion causing tamponade
Constrictive pericarditis

• Xanthelasmata: hypercholesterolaemia (vascular
disease).
• Mouth: high-arched palate in Marfan’s syndrome.
• De Musset’s sign: head nodding due to aortic
regurgitation.
• Roth’s spots in the retina: bacterial endocarditis.

Praecordium
Look for scars and deformities, including:
• Sternotomy scar: arterial bypass grafts and valve
replacements.
• Mitral valvotomy scar under the left breast: always
look for it, as it indicates a previously closed mitral
valvotomy.
• Skeletal deformities: can cause an ejection systolic
flow murmur.

• Impalpable: obesity, pleural effusion, pericardial
effusion, chronic obstructive airways disease and
dextrocardia (palpable on the right!).
• Tapping: mitral stenosis (palpable first heart sound).
• Heaving: ‘pressure overload’ in aortic stenosis or
hypertension.
• Thrusting: ‘volume overload’ in aortic regurgitation,
mitral regurgitation (ventricle usually markedly
displaced).
• Diffuse: left ventricular dilatation.
• Double impulse: left ventricular aneurysm or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Palpation
Parasternal heave is caused by the enlargement or hypertrophy of the right ventricle.
A thrill is a palpable murmur and indicates significant valve disease; it can be systolic or diastolic and
therefore its position in the cardiac cycle should be

• Are there any murmurs? (See Ch. 30.)
• Listen for additional sounds including opening
snap, ejection click, pericardial knock or rub, and
mechanical valves.
• Time any abnormalities against the carotid pulsation.
• Listen to the carotid arteries for bruits (atheroma) or

The respiratory system

To conclude. . .

Pulse

• Examine the lung bases for pulmonary oedema and
pleural effusions indicating left ventricular failure.
• Look for sacral oedema.
• Palpate for hepatomegaly, which occurs in right ventricular failure.
• Look for pitting oedema and note the level (e.g. to
knees).
• Palpate the peripheral pulses: pulses in the legs may
be diminished in peripheral vascular disease. Systolic and diastolic murmurs may be heard in the
femoral arteries that are due to aortic regurgitation
(pistol shots and Duroziez’s sign).
• Full set of observations and ECG.
• Dip the urine for haematuria (endocarditis).

• Tachycardia: severe respiratory disease (e.g. pulmonary embolism, acute asthma or pneumonia).
• Bounding: carbon dioxide retention.
• Atrial fibrillation: e.g. sepsis secondary to pneumonia.

THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

Visual survey
• Does the patient look well or ill? Is the patient alert?
• Respiratory rate: normally around 12–16 breaths
per min.
• Cachexia: COPD or underlying malignancy.
• Sputum pot: note contents.
• Nebulizer and medications.
• Distress: breathless at rest and moving around in
the bed.
• Pursed lip breathing: chronic small airways
obstruction.
• Voice: hoarse in bronchial carcinoma (recurrent
laryngeal nerve palsy).
• Chest drain and contents.

Position
Help the patient to adopt a comfortable position at 45
with the chest exposed. In women, cover the chest until
you are ready to examine it.

Hands
• Clubbing: see Fig. 2.4.
• Cyanosis: respiratory failure.
• Wasting of small muscles: infiltration of T1 by bronchial neoplasm (Pancoast’s tumour).
• Tar-stained fingers: increased likelihood of malignancy and obstructive airways disease.
• Asterixis (flap): carbon dioxide retention.
• Evidence of conditions which may involve the lungs
(e.g. systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis) (see
Ch. 31).

Blood pressure
Pulsus paradoxus is seen in severe acute asthma.

Jugular venous pressure
• Right ventricular failure: chronic respiratory disease
with pulmonary hypertension.
• Superior vena caval obstruction: bronchial carcinoma.
• Large ‘a’ waves: cor pulmonale.

Face
• Central cyanosis: respiratory failure.
• Anaemia: chronic respiratory disease, particularly
malignancy.
• Horner’s syndrome: apical carcinoma (Pancoast’s
tumour) involving cervical sympathetic nerves
(see Ch. 34).
• Fine tremor: beta-agonists.
• Plethoric facies: secondary polycythaemia.

Trachea
Warn the patient before you palpate the trachea! Note
the following:
• Tracheal deviation reflects pathology in the upper
mediastinum (Fig. 2.10).
• Feel for tracheal tug in acute respiratory distress.
• The distance from the cricoid cartilage to the suprasternal notch should be 2–3 cm – this distance reduces in hyperinflation.
COMMUNICATION
Always take care to explain what you are doing to the
patient when you are examining the trachea. If done
badly, it may be uncomfortable, and if you hurt the
patient you are likely to fail.

Auscultation

Perform inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation on the front of the chest first. Then sit the patient
forward, palpate for lymphadenopathy and then repeat
the examination on the back of the chest. Typical
patterns of respiratory abnormalities are shown in
Fig. 2.11.

• Normal breath sounds are termed ‘vesicular’.
• Bronchial breathing, whispering pectoriloquy, increased vocal resonance: consolidation (sometimes
fibrosis and above pleural effusion).
• Wheeze: small airways obstruction (polyphonic),
large airway obstruction (e.g. bronchial carcinoma
(monophonic or localized)) and cardiac failure.
• Fine crackles: pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary oedema.
• Coarse crackles: infection.
• Absent breath sounds: pleural effusion.
• Pleural rub: pleural irritation due to pneumonia or
pulmonary embolus.

Inspection
On inspecting the chest, assess the following:
• Respiration: use of accessory muscles (respiratory
distress).
• Recession: intercostal and subcostal (respiratory
distress).
• Scars: including previous surgery and chest drains.
• Deformity: barrel chest (seen in long-standing airways obstruction as a result of hyperinflation), pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum.
• Radiotherapy: tattoos or skin changes indicate previous treatment for malignancy.

Expansion
• Ask the patient to take a deep breath in and note
symmetry and comfort.
• The chest circumference should expand by at least
5 cm on deep inspiration.
• Any significant pulmonary disease will reduce
expansion.
• In unilateral disease, the affected side will move less
than the other.
• Note any chest wall tenderness, which is usually
caused by musculoskeletal abnormalities.

Vocal fremitus
Ask the patient to say ‘99’ and palpate with the ulnar
border of the hand. Increased vocal fremitus indicates
consolidation; decreased indicates pleural effusion or
collapse. This part of the examination has been largely
superseded by auscultating for vocal resonance.

Percussion
Compare one side with the other and remember the axillae. The following signs are important:
• Hyper-resonance: pneumothorax.
• Dull: solid organ (liver or heart), consolidation, collapse, pleural thickening, peripheral tumours, severe
fibrosis, previous old pneumonectomy.
• Stony dull: pleural effusion.

18

To conclude. . .
• Pitting oedema indicates right ventricular failure.
• Sputum inspection, peak flow, oxygen saturation,
temperature and chest X-ray: these can be remembered by the mnemonic SPOT-X.
HINTS AND TIPS
The upper border of the liver is normally at the 6th
intercostal space in the right midclavicular line. If the
percussion note remains resonant below this, the lungs
are hyperinflated.

THE ABDOMEN

Visual survey
• Appearance: does the patient look well or ill?
• Is the patient in pain?
• Patient’s position: think of peritonism if very still,
appendicitis (psoas irritation) if knees flexed and renal colic if rolling around in agony.
• Cachexia: chronic disease, particularly malignancy.
• Drowsy: encephalopathy (hepatic or uraemia).
• Hydration status.

Position
The patient can initially be assessed sitting at 45 . For
examination of the abdomen itself, the patient should
be as flat as can be tolerated comfortably (this relaxes
the abdominal muscles). Exposure should be from
‘nipples to knees’ but bear in mind the patient’s dignity.

Hands
• Clubbing: cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease.
• Leuconychia: liver failure, nephrotic syndrome,
protein-losing enteropathy.

Causes

Examination of the patient
• Koilonychia: chronic iron deficiency, consider
occult neoplasm, particularly in the stomach and
caecum.
• Palmar erythema: cirrhosis.
• Asterixis: hepatic encephalopathy and uraemia.
• Dupuytren’s contracture: alcoholic liver disease.
• Half-and-half nails: renal failure.

Arms
• Scratch marks: obstructive jaundice (particularly
primary biliary cirrhosis) and lymphoma.
• Needle track marks: viral hepatitis.
• Muscle wasting: proximal myopathy due to alcohol,
steroid excess or underlying malignancy (paraneoplastic).
• Bruising: hepatic impairment.

Trunk and back
Spider naevi arise in the distribution of the superior
vena cava – five or more suggest underlying chronic liver
disease, pregnancy or hyperthyroidism.
Gynaecomastia and sexual hair loss indicate chronic
liver disease.

The abdomen
Inspection
Observe closely, looking for the following:
•
•
•
•

•

Face

Scars: previous surgery or trauma.
Distension (Fig. 2.12).
Obvious mass: including movement with respiration.
Bruising: Cullen’s (para-umbilical) and Grey
Turner’s (flanks) signs in acute pancreatitis (these
are rare).
Dilated veins and caput medusae: portal hypertension or inferior vena cava obstruction (venous flow
is upwards).
Expansile pulsation: abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Striae: pregnancy or Cushing’s syndrome.
Node: umbilical nodule (Sister Mary Joseph’s
nodule) is a metastasis from intra-abdominal malignancy.
Peristalsis: if visible this indicates an obstruction,
though it may be normal in a thin or elderly patient.

• Jaundice: prehepatic, hepatic or posthepatic (see
Ch. 13).
• Anaemia: from any cause (see Ch. 29).
• Xanthelasmata: hypercholesterolaemia (primary
biliary cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome).
• Kayser–Fleischer rings: Wilson’s disease (best seen
by slit-lamp examination).

•
•
•

Mouth

Palpation

• Hydration.
• Glossitis and stomatitis: iron deficiency and megaloblastic anaemia.
• Pigmentation: Addison’s disease, chronic liver disease,
chronic renal failure and Peutz–Jeghers syndrome.
• Telangiectasia: hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu disease).
• Crohn’s disease: lip swelling and mucosal ulceration.
• Gingival hypertrophy.

Neck
Look for left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy –
caused by metastasis from underlying gastrointestinal
carcinoma (Virchow’s node or Troisier’s sign).
HINTS AND TIPS
Always palpate the neck from behind the patient
with the neck slightly flexed to relax the
sternocleidomastoid muscles.

20

•

HINTS AND TIPS
Always look at the patient’s face when palpating the
abdomen to ensure that you know immediately if you
are causing discomfort.

Before you touch the patient, ask if they are tender anywhere and start palpation away from that area. Feel
gently in each of the four quadrants, noting tenderness

or masses. Then feel more deeply in each quadrant to determine the characteristics of any mass found (Fig. 2.13).
If a mass is present, consider what structures normally lie at that site and what disease processes might
affect that structure (see Ch. 14). Next, palpate for hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, starting in the right iliac
fossa. Examine for renal masses by bimanual palpation.
If hepatomegaly or splenomegaly is present, comment
on consistency (smooth or irregular) and size in centimetres (not finger breadths) beneath the costal margin
(the causes of hepatomegaly are shown in Fig. 2.14; the
causes of splenomegaly are discussed in detail in
Ch. 25). A palpable liver must also be assessed for pulsatility (tricuspid regurgitation), tenderness and bruits.

Do not forget the distinguishing features of the
spleen and kidney (see Fig. 25.2); the causes of a renal
mass are summarized in Fig. 2.15.
Finally, palpate for abdominal aortic aneurysm and
examine the groins for lymphadenopathy and herniae.

Percussion
Always percuss from resonance to dullness. Use percussion to determine the size of the liver and spleen, starting at the chest, moving inferiorly. Percuss over any
masses to determine their consistency. Always assess
for ascites by looking for a fluid thrill and shifting dullness. Fig. 2.16 summarizes the causes of ascites. Look for
tenderness on percussion; this is a useful clinical sign
that may indicate peritoneal irritation.

To conclude. . .
• Digital rectal examination often provides useful clinical information and in some circumstances is essential, such as rectal bleeding, iron deficiency or
change in bowel habit. Genital examination may
also be needed in some circumstances. In the clinical
examinations, if you say that you would also like to
examine the genitalia and perform a rectal examination, you will usually be taken to the next case.
• If there is hepatosplenomegaly, go on to examine all
lymph node sites, bearing in mind the multitude of
potential causes (see Ch. 25).
• Look at the legs for pitting oedema (Fig. 2.18).
• Examine hernial orfices.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
All medical short case examinations will involve at least
one neurology case.
Although it is true that neuroanatomy is complicated
and many different diseases can affect each part, the end
result is a limited repertoire of patterns of signs. The best
approach is to identify which signs are present using a
well-rehearsed technique and consider where the lesion
is likely to be. You can then think of which diseases affect that part of the nervous system and look for additional evidence to support the diagnosis.
The clinical signs and common diseases associated
with different parts of the nervous system are discussed
in detail in Ch. 26. This section covers a practical approach to the examination technique itself. It is particularly important to practise this routine over and over
again.

Visual survey
• Appearance: does the patient look well or ill?
• Conscious level: is the patient alert, drowsy or
unresponsive?
• Age: for instance a young patient is more likely to
have multiple sclerosis or an inherited disease; an elderly patient is more likely to have had a stroke.
• General clues: such as the need of a wheelchair or
diabetic drinks?
• Posture: how is the patient sitting? Is the patient
leaning towards one side (hemiparesis)? Is there a
tremor at rest (parkinsonism)?
• Speech: when the patient speaks does the speech
sound normal? (See Fig. 1.5.)

Cranial nerves
Features and examinations of the cranial nerves include
the following.

First cranial nerve (olfactory)
• Sensory only.
• This is not routinely tested but ask the patient if they
have noticed anything abnormal about their sense of
smell.
• Sense of smell can be tested using bottles containing
essences, although this test is rarely performed.
(Note that ammonia should not be used as it also
stimulates the trigeminal nerve.)
• Anosmia can result from head injury (fracture of the
cribriform plate), upper respiratory tract infection,
tumour (olfactory groove meningioma or glioma)
or Kallmann’s syndrome (anosmia with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism).

2

The nervous system

Second cranial nerve (optic)
The order of examination can be remember with AFRO.
• Sensory only.
• Visual Acuity: ask the patient to read some print or
Snellen’s chart (with spectacles if normally worn).
Test each eye separately. Any lesion from the cornea,
lens, retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiation or occipital cortex can result in reduced acuity.
• Visual Fields: test each eye individually. Make sure
your eyes are on the same level as the patient’s. Move
your fingers from beyond your visual field inwards
and ask the patient to tell you when they can see
them. Check each quadrant. Use a red hatpin to determine the blind spot. Typical field defects are
shown in Fig. 2.19. Vision can be formally assessed
using perimetry. If the visual fields are intact, look
for inattention by simultaneously stimulating both
the left and right.
• Pupillary Reflexes: the pupillary reactions to light
and accommodation should be tested. It is essential
to understand the sympathetic and parasympathetic
innervation of the pupils as well as the neurological
pathways involved in the light and convergence reflexes if pupillary abnormalities are to be understood (see Crash Course: Nervous System). Pupillary
abnormalities in coma patients are described in
Fig. 22.5. Other clinical abnormalities include:
• physiological anisocoria: slight difference in size.
• senile miosis: small, irregular pupils in old age.
• total afferent pupillary defect (complete lesion of
optic nerve): if for instance the left eye is affected,
shining a light in it fails to cause pupillary constriction in either eye – absent direct and consensual reflexes. However, if light is shone in the
right eye the left pupil constricts (i.e. the right
eye consensual reflex is intact).
• relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) occurs
if there is incomplete damage to the afferent

pathway (e.g. previous retrobulbar neuritis due
to multiple sclerosis). The swinging light test is
performed (i.e. the light is moved from one eye
to the other alternately). If the left eye has a
RAPD, there will be reduced conduction along
its afferent pathway. Therefore, if the light is initially shone in the left eye, both pupils will constrict; on moving the light to the right eye,
bilateral constriction occurs again; when the light
returns to the left eye, the pupil dilates because of
its reduced afferent conduction. This is diagnostic
of a RAPD.
• Horner’s syndrome: see Ch. 34
• Argyll Robertson pupil: a small, irregular pupil
that ‘accommodates but does not react’ (i.e. fixed
to light but constricts on convergence). Almost
diagnostic of neurosyphilis (occasionally occurs
in diabetes mellitus).
• myotonic pupil (Holmes–Adie pupil): a dilated
pupil that reacts very slowly to light and constricts incompletely to convergence. Most common in young females and, if combined with
absent tendon reflexes, this is Holmes–Adie
syndrome.
• Ophthalmoscopy: common abnormalities on ophthalmoscopy are papilloedema (Fig. 2.20), optic atrophy (Fig. 2.21), diabetic retinopathy (Fig. 2.22),
hypertensive retinopathy (see Fig. 30.22) and, in exams,
retinitis pigmentosa. Pigmentary retinal degeneration
may also occur in other conditions such as Refsum’s
disease and Laurence–Moon–Biedl syndrome.

COMMUNICATION
Prolonged gazing with an ophthalmoscope can be
uncomfortable for the patient. Be aware of this – giving
the patient a short break can be helpful.

Third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves
• Ask the patient to follow your finger with their eyes
and tell you if they ‘see double’.
• Look for nystagmus. This is involuntary rhythmic
eye oscillation. It may be pendular, with equal
movement in all directions, or more commonly ’jerk
nystagmus’ with a slow drift away from the point of
fixation and a fast corrective phase. It occurs physiologically at the extremes of lateral gaze and >2
beats are required for it to be significant. It may be
due to peripheral lesions (affecting the labyrinth
or 8th nerve), central vestibular or brainstem lesions,
or cerebellar lesions. As a general rule, peripheral lesions cause unidirectional nystagmus that is horizontal or torsional, has a fast phase away from the

side of the lesion and improves with fixation. In nystagmus due to central lesions, the fast phase is toward the side of the lesions, it may occur in more
than one direction and does not improve with fixation. Brainstem lesions may cause unusual patterns
including upbeat or downbeat nystagmus. Congenital causes and early loss of central vision (e.g. albinism) may cause pendular nystagmus.
• Assess conjugate gaze by asking the patient to look at
your hand and then to a finger on your other hand,
and then from one to the other as quickly as possible.
If there is an internuclear ophthalmoplegia (a lesion
in the medial longitudinal fasciculus), there will be
slow movement in the adducting eye and nystagmus
in the abducting eye. If one eye is covered, or if convergence is attempted, adduction is normal, as this is
a disorder of conjugate gaze. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is usually caused by multiple sclerosis but may
occasionally result from vascular lesions.
• Diplopia in all directions of gaze may result from
myasthenia gravis, ocular myopathy or disease in
the surrounding tissue of the eye, such as Graves’ disease, tumour or orbital cellulitis.

Third cranial nerve (oculomotor)
• Motor supply to levator palpebrae superioris, all orbital muscles except the superior oblique and lateral
rectus muscles, and parasympathetic tone to pupillary reflex.

The nervous system
• Controls pupillary reflexes, in addition to the second
cranial nerve. Test the reaction to light and accommodation (as above).
• Lesion of this nerve results in ptosis and a dilated pupil with no reaction to light or accommodation. The
eye looks ‘down and out’ at rest and is unable to look
upwards or inwards.
• Causes of 3rd cranial nerve lesions are infarction,
posterior communicating artery aneurysm (which
is painful), mononeuritis multiplex (see Ch. 26), demyelination, tumour and neurosyphilis. Medical, as
opposed to mechanical, compression causes of 3rd
nerve palsy often spare the parasympathetic nerve
fibres (i.e. there is ‘pupillary sparing’). Conversely,
compressive lesions are associated with relatively
less ophthalmoplegia. This is because the parasympathetic fibres run on the surface of the nerve.

Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear)
• Motor supply to the superior oblique muscle.
• Patient may have the head tilted away from the
lesion.
• Diplopia on looking down and away from the lesion
with one image at an angle to the other.
• Lesions of the 4th cranial nerve are usually associated with 3rd cranial nerve lesions and have a similar
aetiology.
• Patients with a 4th cranial nerve palsy have difficulty
with vision when walking downstairs or reading
a book.

Sixth cranial nerve (abducens)
• Motor supply to the lateral rectus.
• There is diplopia on abduction of the affected eye
with two images side by side.
• Lesions of the 6th cranial nerve are caused by mononeuritis multiplex, diabetes mellitus, demyelination,
tumour, infarction, thiamine deficiency (Wernicke’s
encephalopathy), raised intracranial pressure (false
localizing sign) and neurosyphilis.

Fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal)
• Sensation to the face (ophthalmic, maxillary and
mandibular branches).
• Motor supply to the muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter and pterygoid muscles).
• Test sensation in the distribution of each division
comparing one side with the other.
• Remember the corneal reflex, which requires intact
motor function of the 7th cranial nerve (as well as
intact sensory function of the trigeminal nerve) for
blinking.
• Ask the patient to clench the teeth.

2

• Ask them to hold the mouth open while you try to
push it shut.
• Test jaw jerk, which is increased in pseudobulbar
palsy and reduced or absent in bulbar palsy.
• The causes of 5th cranial nerve lesions are shown in
Fig. 2.23.

Seventh cranial nerve (facial)
• Sensation of taste from the floor of the mouth, the
soft palate and anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
• Motor supply to the muscles of facial expression and
the stapedius muscle.
• Parasympathetic supply to the salivary and lacrimal
glands.
• Ask the patient to wrinkle the forehead, screw the eyes
tightly shut, show the teeth and blow the cheeks out.
• In lower motor neurone lesions all the muscles are
affected.
• In upper motor neurone lesions, the upper half of
the face and emotional expressions are spared (e.g.
normal eye closure and wrinkling of the forehead).
• Taste is not usually examined formally but ask if the
patient has noticed any recent change. Involvement
of the nerve to stapedius causes hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to high-pitched or loud sounds).
• Fig. 2.24 summarizes the causes of facial nerve
palsies.
HINTS AND TIPS
Crossed signs – cranial nerve abnormalities
contralateral to limb abnormalities – should alert you to
the possibility of a brainstem lesion.

Eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear)
• Sensory to the utricle, saccule and semicircular canals (vestibular), and to the organ of Corti (cochlea).

• Ask if the patient has noticed any difficulty with
hearing.
• Assess the ability of the patient to hear whispered
numbers with the other ear covered.
• Rinne’s test: place a vibrating tuning fork on the mastoid process and then at the external auditory meatus –
the test is positive if the sound is louder when the fork
is held at the external auditory meatus (i.e. air conduction) than when placed on the mastoid process (i.e.
bone conduction). This is normal. An abnormal test
(Rinne negative) indicates conductive deafness.
• Weber’s test: place a vibrating tuning fork at the centre of the forehead; the sound will be heard towards
the normal ear in sensorineural deafness or towards
the affected ear in conductive deafness.
• The causes of vestibular disease are shown in
Fig. 27.1.

Ninth and tenth cranial nerves
• Look at palatal movement (ask the patient to say
‘Aah’).
• Lesions cause reduced palatal elevation on the affected side, with the uvula pulled towards the normal side.
• Check the gag reflex (9th, sensory; 10th, motor).
• The causes of 9th and 10th nerve lesions are summarized in Fig. 2.26.

Ninth cranial nerve (glossopharyngeal)
• Sensory to pharynx and carotid sinus and taste to the
posterior third of the tongue.
• Motor supply to the stylopharyngeus muscle.
• Parasympathetic to the parotid gland.

Tenth cranial nerve (vagus)
• Sensory to the larynx.
• Motor supply to the cricothyroid and the muscles
of the pharynx and larynx.
• Parasympathetic to the bronchi, heart and gastrointestinal tract.

Eleventh cranial nerve (accessory)
• Cranial root provides the motor supply to some
muscles of the soft palate and larynx.
• Spinal root provides the motor supply to the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles.
• Ask the patient to shrug the shoulders and test
against resistance.
• Ask the patient to turn his or her head against your
resisting hand and test the sternocleidomastoid
muscle bulk.

Twelfth cranial nerve (hypoglossal)
• Provides the motor supply to the styloglossus, hyoglossus and all intrinsic muscles of the tongue.
• Ask the patient to open the mouth. Look for wasting
and fasciculation, indicating a lower motor neurone
lesion of the tongue.

The limbs
• Then ask the patient to protrude the tongue. If there
is a unilateral lesion the tongue will deviate towards
the side of the lesion.
• Upper motor neurone lesions are due to stroke,
tumour or motor neurone disease.
• Lower motor neurone lesions are due to diseases
in the posterior fossa, skull base and neck, including tumour, motor neurone disease, syringobulbia,
trauma and poliomyelitis.

THE LIMBS

Inspection
• Wasting: lower motor neurone lesion, muscle disease and disuse.
• Fasciculation: lower motor neurone lesion.
• Scars: particularly from surgery.
• Deformity: may cause mononeuropathy by entrapment, and contractures may be the result of neurological disease.
• Tremor (Fig. 2.27).
• Pes cavus: Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, (hereditary
motor and sensory neuropathy) Refsum’s disease.

Tone
Reduced tone is a feature of a lower motor neurone
lesion or cerebellar lesion. Hypertonia may manifest
as either spasticity or rigidity. Spasticity describes the
sudden build up of increased tone during the first few
degrees of passive movement. The resistance lessens as
the movement is continued and this is characteristic
of upper motor neurone lesions. This is often described
as the ‘clasp-knife’ phenomenon. Rigidity describes the
sustained resistance to passive movement seen in extrapyramidal conditions (e.g. parkinsonism). This may be
described as ‘lead pipe’ rigidity and when associated

with a tremor gives rise to ‘cogwheel’ rigidity. Test for
clonus (usually at ankle, but can also do at patella),
signifying an upper motor neurone lesion.

Power
All muscle groups should be tested and scored
(Fig. 2.28). You will need to learn the root value for each
movement (Fig. 2.29). Remember to compare muscle
power of one side to the other for each group.
Look for pronator drift by asking the patient to hold
their arms outstretched, palms upward, and close their
eyes. Marked weakness will be easily apparent. If an upper motor neurone lesion affecting the parietal lobe is
present, the arm will drift downwards and the hand will
pronate.

Coordination
Ask the patient to alternately touch their nose and your
finger. In cerebellar disease, there will be an intention
tremor and past pointing (i.e. the patient overshoots
the examining clinician’s finger consistently towards
the side of the lesion). Ask the patient to tap one palm
with alternating sides of the other hand as quickly as
possible (demonstrate to the patient what you would
like them to do). In cerebellar disease, this will be slow,
poorly coordinated and the action of the moving hand
has a high amplitude – this is dysdiadochokinesis.
To check coordination in the lower limbs, ask the patient to lift the leg, place the heel on the knee of the opposite leg and gently run it down the shin and repeat
this motion. In cerebellar disease, this will be slow
and clumsy.

Reflexes
Practise as often as you can. Learn the root value of each
reflex (Fig. 2.30). Reflexes can be reduced, normal or increased. They will be reduced or absent in lower motor
neurone lesions, sensory neuropathy and severe muscle
disease (disruption of reflex arc), and will be

be upgoing in upper motor neurone lesions.

Sensation
Test each dermatome (Fig. 2.31) for the sensation of
light touch, pinprick (and temperature). Then, starting
distally, check vibration and joint position sense. Remember the different pathways these senses take
(Fig. 2.32). The tests for the various sensory modalities
are shown in Fig. 2.33.

28

Eversion (S1)

Gait
• Ask the patient to walk for 2–3 m, turn and walk
back, then walk heel to toe (cerebellar ataxia) and
finally stand on toes and on heels (any muscle weakness will now manifest itself).
• Make sure you walk with the patient so you can catch
them if they fall.
• An immense amount of information can be gained
by careful study of these aspects of gait
(see Fig. 26.3).
• Romberg’s test: this assesses posterior column function (proprioception).

HINTS AND TIPS
Sensory testing is difficult and subjective. A thorough
inspection and examination of tone, power,
coordination and reflexes may help to predict which
sensory abnormality should be expected.

THE JOINTS
Diseases affecting the musculoskeletal system and how
to distinguish between different disease processes on
clinical examination have been discussed in detail in
Ch. 19. However, remember the following broad components to the examination of joints.

• Active and passive movement.
• Is pain associated with movement?
• Is the joint stable? Are there intact ligaments and
supporting musculature?

Assessment of disability
It is very important to get an impression of how limiting
the joint problem is. For example, in a patient with
rheumatoid arthritis, ask the patient to undo some buttons or write their name with a pen.

LYMPHADENOPATHY
Examine all lymph node sites (Fig. 2.34). Always examine the cervical lymph nodes standing behind the
patient. The causes of generalized and localized lymphadenopathy are discussed in Ch. 25. If lymphadenopathy is present, pay special attention to examination of
the spleen and liver.

BREAST EXAMINATION
Breast examination should be performed in women who
have symptoms of breast disease or when an underlying
malignancy is suspected. Do not forget that breast tissue
extends into the axillae. Breast examination must be
approached sensitively with a full explanation. Male

will usually be a thyroid mass or lymphadenopathy.

thyroid enlargement.
First, look very carefully at the neck, lifting the hair
out of the way if necessary. Look for obvious masses,
scars, skin changes or deformity. If there is a mass in
the region of the thyroid gland, ask the patient to take
a sip of water into their mouth and then swallow – a goitre will move upwards on swallowing. In addition, ask
the patient to open the mouth and then watch as the
tongue protrudes – a thyroglossal cyst will move upwards. If a mass is present, assess its properties as described in Fig. 2.13. Percussion is useful to determine
retrosternal extension of a goitre. Bruits may be audible
in the thyroid gland (thyrotoxicosis) or carotid artery
(atheroma). If you find a thyroid mass, you should go
on to assess thyroid status as shown in Fig. 2.36.
HINTS AND TIPS
If the neck is normal, examine the JVP, listen to the
carotid artery for bruits and re-examine for cervical rib.

The clerking

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Structure your clerking in a logical manner.
• Appreciate factors in the clerking that make it easier for colleagues to review.
• Vary the clerking according to the patient’s symptoms.
• Know how to conclude the clerking and the purpose that this serves.

INTRODUCTION
The doctor’s ‘clerking’ is a written summary of the patient’s history and examination. It is a legal document
and should be precise, complete and legible. Avoid
using abbreviations – although the meaning may be
obvious to you, they may be interpreted very differently
in a different speciality or hospital. However, in real life,
abbreviations litter the medical notes and you ought to
be familiar with the most common ones.
The ‘history of presenting complaint’ section is a
useful place to document the most relevant positive
and negative historical points. Less relevant details
can be recorded in their appropriate subsection. For example, in the case presented here, the relevant negative
historical points have been included in the ‘history of

presenting complaint’ rather than elsewhere in the
clerking.
At the end of the clerking, the salient points should
be emphasized in a summary statement. You should
then, always, compile a ‘problem list’. This is often forgotten by students and junior doctors alike, but is invaluable in planning appropriate investigations and
management. In some patients, it will not be appropriate, or even possible, to take a full history and perform a
full clinical examination (e.g. in an emergency situation). We have outlined a clinical example.
As a student, it is good practice to be very thorough as it
helps you to learn the relevant questions and to avoid missing anything important. However, with practice, you will
learn to tailor carefully the clinical approach to each patient
based on their individual, and often very different, needs.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the causes of chest pain.
• Have a systematic approach to assessing a patient presenting with chest pain.
• Understand the sequence of investigations in a patient with chest pain.

INTRODUCTION
Chest pain is a common cause for both referral and
admission to hospital – ranging from a simple musculoskeletal strain to a life-threatening myocardial infarction (Fig. 4.1). The many possible aetiologies therefore
need to be elucidated. Taking a clear history is essential
in making the correct diagnosis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
CHEST PAIN

Pleuritic chest pain
This is a sharp pain caused by irritation of the pleura
that is worse on deep inspiration, coughing or movement. The differential diagnosis includes the following:
•
•
•
•

Pneumothorax.
Pneumonia.
Pulmonary embolus.
Pericarditis: retrosternal.

Central chest pain
The differential diagnosis of central pain includes the
following:
• Angina: crushing/tightness.
• Myocardial infarction: angina-like but commonly more
severe, long-lasting and with associated symptoms.
• Dissecting aortic aneurysm: tearing interscapular pain.
• Oesophagitis: burning.
• Oesophageal spasm.

Chest wall tenderness
The differential diagnosis of chest wall tenderness includes the following:
• Rib fracture.
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00004-X

• Shingles (herpes zoster): pain precedes rash.
• Costochondritis (Tietze’s syndrome).

Atypical presentations
The differential diagnosis in atypical presentations (or
in any of the above) includes anxiety and referred pain
from vertebral collapse causing nerve root irritation or
intra-abdominal pathology (e.g. pancreatitis, peptic
ulcer or biliary tree disorders).

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
CHEST PAIN
A careful history of the chest pain will generally be suggestive of the likely underlying problem. The SOCRATES
principle (Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associated
features, Time course, Exacerbating/relieving factors
and Severity) is particularly suited to chest pain and will
allow for the formation of a sensible differential diagnosis. The focus should then turn to specific risk factors.

What type of chest pain does
the patient have?
Onset and progression of pain
Cardiac ischaemic pain typically builds up over a few
minutes and may be brought on by exercise, emotion
or cold weather. In angina, the pain resolves on resting
or with nitrate (GTN) usage. It is often reproducible with
consistent effort. In unstable angina, the pain may come
on at rest or be of increasing frequency or severity. In
myocardial infarction (MI), the pain is severe, often associated with systemic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting
and sweating, often lasts for at least 30 min and is not
usually fully relieved by GTN. The terms angina and
MI now all fall under the umbrella term ‘acute coronary
syndrome’ or ‘ACS’. Spontaneous pneumothorax and
pulmonary embolism usually cause sudden onset of

pleuritic pain and dyspnoea (the patient often remembers exactly what they were doing at the time).

Site and radiation of pain
Cardiac ischaemia and pericarditis cause retrosternal
pain. With ischaemia, the pain is tight and ‘crushing’,
band like, etc., often radiating to the neck, jaw or arms.
Pericarditis is pleuritic and may be worse on lying flat
but relieved by sitting forward. A dissecting aortic aneurysm causes tearing pain radiating through to the back.
Pulmonary disease may cause unilateral pain, which the
patient can often localize specifically. Oesophageal disease can also cause retrosternal pain and may mimic cardiac pain. Referred pain from vertebral collapse or
shingles will follow a dermatomal pattern.

Nature of pain
The precise nature of the pain gives important clues as to
the underlying diagnosis. Most commonly the pain is
dull/tight or sharp/stabbing. Asking patients to point
with one finger to the site of the pain can help in distinguishing between the different types of chest pain.

Are there any associated
symptoms?
Important associated symptoms include:
• Dyspnoea: pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary oedema in cardiac ischaemia,
hyperventilation in anxiety (these patients will often
complain of tingling in their extremities which is due
to the fact that they blow off too much carbon
dioxide).
• Cough: purulent sputum in pneumonia, haemoptysis in pulmonary embolism, frothy pink sputum in
pulmonary oedema, dry in pneumothorax.
• Rigors: pneumonia (particularly lobar pneumococcal pneumonia).
• Calf swelling: has a pulmonary embolism (PE)
arisen from deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?
• Palpitations: arrhythmia, e.g. new-onset atrial fibrillation, can cause angina or result from cardiac ischaemia, PE or pneumonia.

38

• Clamminess, nausea, vomiting and sweating are features of myocardial infarction or massive pulmonary
embolism.

Are risk factors present?
Important risk factors include:
• Ischaemic heart disease: smoking, family history,
hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes.
• PE: recent travel, immobility, surgery, family history,
pregnancy, malignancy, contraceptive pill.
• Pneumothorax: spontaneous (young, thin men, more
commonly smokers), trauma, emphysema, asthma,
malignancy.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
CHEST PAIN
The examination should focus on determining the cause
of the pain, then looking for risk factors and consequences
of the underlying problem. A schematic guide to examining the patient with chest pain is given in Fig. 4.2.

What is the cause of the pain?
Pay particular attention to:
• Pulse: tachycardia/bradycardia or arrhythmia.
• Blood pressure: discrepancy between left and right
arms in aortic dissection (the pulse volumes may
also be unequal). Shock in tension pneumothorax,
massive pulmonary embolism, MI.
• Chest wall tenderness: rib fracture, costochondritis,
anxiety, shingles.
• Chest examination: pneumothorax, consolidation,
pleural rub, pulmonary oedema, third heart sound.
• Cardiac examination: rub (pericarditis), murmur of
aortic regurgitation in aortic dissection.
HINTS AND TIPS
Patients who have a median sternotomy scar are
common in finals. Always check the legs for vein
harvesting scars and listen out for a metallic heart sound.

Are there risk factors?

The acute phase

The following risk factors may be present:

Blood tests

• Abnormal lipids: xanthelasma, tendon xanthoma.
• Tar-stained fingers: predisposition to ischaemic heart
disease.
• Hot, oedematous, tender calf suggesting deep vein
thrombosis.
• Hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, features of
Marfan’s syndrome or of diabetes.

Patients will have a full blood count, urea and electrolytes
and glucose performed as routine. Other tests may include cardiac enzymes, troponin I or T (see Ch. 30) at
6–12 h after symptom onset, inflammatory markers or
D-dimers, as guided by history and examination. Aspartate transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase are now
largely redundant in acute ischaemic chest pain.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH CHEST PAIN
All patients with chest pain should have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest radiograph (CXR). Further investigation will be directed by findings in these tests in
conjunction with the history and clinical examination.

HINTS AND TIPS
While troponin is a useful enzyme to investigate
potential myocardial ischaemia, it may also be raised
(although often to a lesser extent) in the following
conditions: renal impairment, heart failure, sepsis,
PE, acute pericarditis.

39

Chest pain

Electrocardiogram
New-onset left bundle branch block, T-wave changes, ST
depression and elevation (Fig. 4.3) on ECG are suggestive
of an acute coronary syndrome. It is vital to recognize
those patients who would benefit from thrombolysis,
or more commonly these days, angioplasty (percutaneous coronary intervention – PCI) as soon as possible.
The management of myocardial infarction with and
without ST segment elevation is discussed later (see
Ch. 30). Changes suggestive of PE are shown in
Fig. 4.4. Arrhythmia may also be detected on ECG. Serial
or continuous ECGs may be needed as all the disease
processes can be dynamic.

HINTS AND TIPS
Although not always possible, it is very useful to
compare the ECG done in the acute setting with an
old ECG. Changes such as LBBB and T-wave inversion
may indeed be long-standing, which would alter your
management.

HINTS AND TIPS
Grace score: a scoring system to predict outcome
for those patients presenting with acute coronary
syndrome (ACS). It calculates a score based on
(at presentation): age, heart rate, systolic blood
pressure, creatinine, class of CCF, troponin rise
and ECG changes. The score predicts subsequent
chance of death or MI during admission and at
6 months. All patients with ACS should be
Grace scored as a matter of routine (see Ch. 30
for details).

Chest X-ray
Pneumothorax, consolidation (pneumonia), widened
mediastinum (aortic dissection), pulmonary oedema
(myocardial ischaemia/infarction), wedge infarct (PE)
and fractured ribs may be detected on CXR.

Arterial blood gases
The assessment of arterial blood gases is useful in
determining the severity of PE (although a normal
gas certainly does not rule this diagnosis out!), pneumonia or pulmonary oedema, showing hypoxia and
occasionally hypocapnia. In hyperventilation related
to anxiety, the Po2 may be mildly elevated while there
will be hypocapnia and a respiratory alkalosis. Always
remember to note the inspired oxygen concentration at
the time of obtaining the arterial blood sample.

Echocardiogram
Echocardiography can be used acutely to demonstrate
cardiac dysfunction, valvular pathology, pericardial effusions and aortic dissection (particularly transoesophageal echocardiography). Computed tomography
(CT) is an alternative in aortic dissection.

Percutaneous coronary intervention
Angioplasty and coronary artery stenting can be used to
reopen occluded arteries in acute myocardial infarction
instead of thrombolysis. Coronary angiography allows
direct visualization of the coronary arterial anatomy.
It is used in angina to determine whether elective angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting might be
beneficial.

The subacute phase
Imaging for pulmonary embolism

 
Ventilation–perfusion (V=Q) scan was the standard imaging used to diagnose PE. However, interpretation of
this test can be difficult, so a CT pulmonary angiogram
 
is now preferred to a V=Q scan in many centres,

Investigating the patient with chest pain
especially if underlying lung disease is present. Pulmonary angiography via cannulation of the pulmonary
arteries remains the definitive investigation when there
are doubts regarding the diagnosis.

Exercise test
An exercise test may be diagnostic when angina is
suspected. It is mainly used in risk stratification

4

post MI or in the outpatient clinic when investigating
chest pain. It is contraindicated in acute coronary
syndromes.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy will confirm oesophagitis and should be considered when the cause of
chest pain is unclear.

Shortness of breath

5

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the causes of shortness of breath.
• Have a systematic approach to assessing a patient presenting with shortness of breath.
• Understand the sequence of investigations in a patient with shortness of breath.

INTRODUCTION
Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) is the subjective sensation of breathlessness which is excessive for a given
level of activity. Dyspnoea may be due to any of the
following:
• Pulmonary disease: disorders of the airways, lung
parenchyma, pleura, pulmonary vasculature and
right ventricle, respiratory muscles or chest wall.
• Cardiac disease: left ventricular systolic and diastolic
dysfunction, arrhythmias or ischaemic heart disease.
• Systemic disease: e.g. anaemia, thyrotoxicosis or
ketoacidosis.
• Non-organic causes: e.g. anxiety or chronic hyperventilation syndrome.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
BREATHLESSNESS

Severity
Quantify the severity by exercise capacity (e.g. distance
walked on the flat or on hills, while dressing or climbing
stairs). Has this changed in recent times? Does it affect
daily activities?

• Chronic onset and progressive decline is associated
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
interstitial lung disease and some non-respiratory
causes, e.g. progressive heart failure.

Aggravating and precipitating
factors
• Precipitating factors: exercise increases the demand
for oxygen and as such many pulmonary and cardiac
causes of dyspnoea are aggravated by exercise. Cold
and airborne material (such as pollen) can irritate
the airways and can cause dyspnoea in the context
of asthma. Dyspnoea that improves at weekends
or on holiday may imply a trigger factor at work.
• Aggravating factors: position can affect dyspnoea;
orthopnoea is the term used for shortness of breath
on lying flat and often indicates underlying cardiac dysfunction. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is breathlessness that wakes the patient from their sleep and,
again, is generally a symptom of cardiac disease.
HINTS AND TIPS
When clarifying the duration of symptoms, asking ‘When
were you last well?’ and then ‘Take me through what
has happened since’ often opens the consultation better
than the more direct ‘How long has this been going on?’

Onset of dyspnoea
The onset of breathlessness and rate of decline give clues
to its aetiology:

Associated features

• Acute onset may indicate a sudden new change such
as aspiration of a foreign body, pneumothorax,
pulmonary embolism, acute asthma or acute pulmonary oedema.
• Subacute onset is more suggestive of parenchymal
disease, pleural effusion, pneumonia and carcinoma
of the bronchus or trachea.

In addition to the above, assess the following in patients
with breathlessness:

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00005-1

• Cough: a chronic persistent cough has many causes, e.g.
underlying lung disease, asthma, gastro-oesophageal
reflux, postnasal drip or drugs (especially angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors where patients
may suffer with a dry cough). How long has the cough

43

Shortness of breath
been present? Is the cough worse at any particular time
of day? (Asthma, for example, typically has a nocturnal
cough, whereas chronic bronchitis associated cough is
particularly bad in the morning.)
Sputum: how much? What does it look like?
Haemoptysis: This is coughing up blood, either frank
blood or blood-tinged sputum. It needs to be distinguished from haematemesis and nasopharyngeal
bleeding (see Ch. 7).
Stridor: a harsh sound caused by turbulent airflow
through a narrowed airway. Inspiratory stridor suggests upper airway obstruction and may indicate
impending airway compromise. Inspiratory and expiratory stridor can indicate fixed obstruction.
Wheeze: a wheeze is a whistling noise in expiration
caused by turbulent airflow through narrowed intrathoracic airways. The commonest causes are asthma
and COPD.

•
•

•

•

• Previous medications: e.g. amiodarone, can cause
interstitial lung disease.
• Angina or previous myocardial infarction: symptoms of cardiac dyspnoea.
• General health: e.g. weight loss, appetite, etc., for a
non-respiratory cause for the dyspnoea.
• Full smoking history.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
BREATHLESSNESS
The examination findings of common respiratory conditions are listed in Fig. 5.1 and the examination approach
in the patient with breathlessness is summarized in
Fig. 5.2. For more detailed description of examination
findings in respiratory disease see Ch. 31.

Other factors

Inspection

• Occupational history, including exposure to asbestos and dusts. Occupational lung disease is important as changing the working environment may
improve symptoms or the patient may benefit from
financial compensation.
• Known lung disease: current, such as asthma or previously such as tuberculosis?
• History of atopy: asthma, seasonal allergic rhinitis
(hayfever) or eczema?
• Pets: can exacerbate asthma or cause chronic lung
diseases (extrinsic allergic alveolitis, e.g. ‘pigeon fanciers’ lung’).
• Current medications: non-cardioselective betablockers may exacerbate wheeze.

Observe the patient from the end of the bed – note the
respiratory rate or surreptitiously do it while feeling the
pulse. Assess work of breathing, use of accessory muscles and any audible sounds. Then proceed to a systematic examination looking for:
• Central cyanosis (a bluish colour in the mouth and
tongue due to excess deoxygenated haemoglobin
(Hb), i.e. >5 g Hb/100 mL of blood): commonly associated with respiratory and cardiac disease. Cyanosis is an unreliable guide to hypoxaemia and is
difficult to appreciate in anaemic patients. Peripheral
cyanosis can be due to poor peripheral circulation
(e.g. cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease, or
physiological due to cold).

• Anaemia: pale conjunctivae.
• Tar staining of the fingers.
• Clubbing: respiratory causes include carcinoma of
the bronchus; suppurative lung disease (e.g. empyema, lung abscess, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis);
fibrosing alveolitis; chronic suppurative pulmonary
tuberculosis; mesothelioma.
• Chest movements on inspiration and expiration: the
pathology is normally found on the side with diminished movement. Expiration should last about twice
as long as inspiration.
• Lip pursing: this is common in patients with severe
obstructive airways disease and associated alveolar
air trapping. By pursing the lips, the patient can
achieve positive end expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP)
which will ease the work of breathing.
• Barrel-shaped chest: emphysema.
• Kyphoscoliosis: can decrease chest size and
expansion.
• Use of accessory muscles of respiration.

• Paradoxical abdominal movement: diaphragmatic
weakness.
• Pattern of breathing: Cheyne–Stokes respiration describes cyclical variation in depth of breathing with
periods of rapid and deep inspiration followed by
periods of apnoea due to depression of the Pco2 below the apnoeic threshold. It can be seen in neurological disease, severe left ventricular failure and
healthy people when at high altitude (so unlikely
to be seen in an exam!)

Palpation
• Cervical lymphadenopathy: malignant disease or
infection.
• Trachea: deviation may indicate underlying chest or
cardiac disease.
• Expansion of the rib cage.
• Tactile vocal fremitus.
• Compare both sides anteriorly and posteriorly.

45

Shortness of breath
HINTS AND TIPS
Always look in the sputum pot:
• Purulent, moderate quantity – bronchitis or
pneumonia.
• Purulent, copious quantity – bronchiectasis or
pneumonia.
• Pink and frothy – pulmonary oedema.
• Blood-stained – causes of haemoptysis.
• Rust-coloured – pneumococcal lobar pneumonia.

Percussion
• Percuss both anteriorly and posteriorly in a systematic manner.
• Increased resonance: indicates increased air
beneath – acutely in pneumothorax or chronically
in emphysema.
• Decreased resonance: indicates increased solid
matter beneath – infection or effusion (classically
‘stony dull’).

Auscultation
• Expiration: may be prolonged in COPD.
• Bronchial breathing: consolidation, cavitation or at
the top of an effusion.
• Breath sounds: diminished over an effusion, pneumothorax and in the obese.
• Rhonchi or wheeze: partially obstructed bronchi;
found in asthma, COPD and occasionally left ventricular failure. If polyphonic, usually suggests multiple small-airway narrowing. If monophonic and
fixed, it can indicate a fixed single obstruction, e.g.
a central malignant lesion.
• Crepitations or crackles (sudden opening of small
closed airways): pulmonary congestion (fine crepitations in early inspiration); fibrosing alveolitis (fine
crepitations in late inspiration); bronchial secretions
(coarse crepitations).
• Friction rub: pleural disease.
• Assess vocal resonance: ask the patient to say and
then whisper ‘99’. It provides the same information
as vocal fremitus but is often easier to detect. Consolidation leads to increased and easily heard speech
due to solid lung tissue conducting the sounds to
the chest wall.
HINTS AND TIPS
To simulate bronchial breathing, place the stethoscope
over your own trachea and listen.

46

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH BREATHLESSNESS
The following investigations should be performed. It is
worth making the distinction between appropriate investigations in the acute and chronic setting.

Acute
• Full blood count: anaemia, leucocytosis in pneumonia.
• Urea, electrolytes and bicarbonate: renal failure producing breathlessness due to acidosis or fluid
overload.
• Blood glucose: diabetic ketoacidosis may present
with acute dyspnoea.
• Chest X-ray: examine methodically.
• Electrocardiogram (ECG): examine systematically
looking for evidence of acute or chronic cardiac
and respiratory disease. Remember that pulmonary embolism may simply show a sinus
tachycardia.
• Arterial oxygen saturation: easy to perform and may
obviate the need for blood gas analysis.
• Arterial blood gases: pH, Po2 and Pco2, base excess,
bicarbonate concentration and lactate level (see Respiratory failure, Ch. 31). If possible, these should be
taken with the patient breathing room air. This investigation must be performed if there is any concern
regarding oxygenation or ventilation.
• CT scanning: used to assess both acute and chronic
dyspnoea (e.g. to investigate PE and to diagnose and
quantify interstitial lung disease and bronchiectasis).
Prior to requesting this scan you would be required
to perform a Well’s score to assess the probability of
the patient having a PE (Fig. 5.3).
• Ventilation–perfusion scan: suspected pulmonary
embolism (PE), although more likely to have CTPA
these days.

Fig. 5.3 Well’s score for assessment of pulmonary
embolism.

Investigating the patient with breathlessness
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that nail varnish, in particular red nail
varnish, will interfere with pulse oximetry
measurements and should be removed.

Chronic
• Spirometry: distinguish between obstructive and restrictive lung pathology. This is best done for diagnosis when the patient is well. Lying and standing vital
capacity will screen for diaphragm weakness.
• Peak expiratory flow rate: useful for assessing acute
decline especially in asthmatic patients who often
know their best results.
• Full pulmonary function tests: transfer factor, flow–
volume loop and lung volumes.
• Bronchoscopy: if an endobronchial lesion is suspected.
• Echocardiogram: assess cardiac structure and function including pulmonary hypertension.

5

HINTS AND TIPS
People commonly say that they stop walking
because of their breathing. Never just accept this, as
they often mean something different. On closer
questioning, they may report other symptoms such as
chest pain, palpitations, muscle fatigue, tiredness
(‘just run out of steam’). These are important, as
they may point to a different diagnosis or different
treatment.

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember, the upper lobes of the lungs are best heard
on the anterior chest wall.

Palpitations

6

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the differential diagnosis of palpitations.
• Have a logical approach to assessing the patient with palpitations.
• Direct investigations in a patient with palpitations.

INTRODUCTION
Always check what the patient means by ‘palpitations’, or clarify what you mean by them, because
the word means different things to different people.
It is usually understood as an awareness of the
heartbeat. The most common cause is an arrhythmia
or dysrhythmia, as it is also often called, although
other causes include conditions causing an increase
in stroke volume (e.g. regurgitant valvular disease)
or conditions causing an increase in cardiac output,
often non-cardiac causes (e.g. exercise, thyrotoxicosis, anaemia or anxiety). If an arrhythmia is suspected, determine whether there is an underlying
cause.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS BY
DESCRIPTION OF THE RHYTHM

Regular rhythm
The differential diagnosis of regular palpitations
(Fig. 6.1) includes the following:
• Heavy heartbeats with normal rate: most often cardiac consciousness with sinus rhythm. It tends to
be worse at rest, especially when in bed at night
and during periods of stress.
• Fast heart rate: sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter with
block, supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular
tachycardia.
• Bursts of fast beats: paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
There is often a very long history dating back
years with a single attack followed by a long interval before the next attack. Other causes include
atrial flutter, junctional rhythm or ventricular
tachycardia.
• Slow heart rate: sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular
block.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00006-3

Irregular rhythm
The differential diagnosis of irregular palpitations
(Fig. 6.1) includes the following:
• Missed beats, ‘thumps’: multiple ectopics from the
atrium or ventricle. The symptoms are more troublesome at rest and may disappear during exercise.
• Fast (or normal if treated): atrial flutter with variable
block, atrial fibrillation (persistent irregularity with
exercise), and multiple premature beats with sinus
tachycardia.

HISTORY
A careful history of the palpitations will often lead to the
correct diagnosis, especially as between episodes examination and investigations may be unremarkable. Are
they continuous or intermittent? Are they fast, normal
rate or slow? Are they regular or irregular? When did
the palpitations start? This can vary from a few minutes
to decades. Generally, if the onset dates back years and
there have been no serious complications (e.g. syncope)
the palpitations are usually benign.
How often do the palpitations occur and how long
do they last for? They may last for days or seconds, with
intervals between episodes of a few hours to years. Has
the patient learned any manoeuvres to terminate the attacks? Enquire about the patient’s concerns as they may
fear serious underlying cardiac disease, although there is
often a benign cause. Are there any associated features?
These may be related to the underlying cause (e.g. angina, features of hyperthyroidism) or be a consequence
of the palpitations (e.g. dizziness or syncope).
HINTS AND TIPS
Ask the patient to tap out their heart rhythm on the
desktop. This will often give a good guide to diagnosis.

Causes and contributing factors
Ask about smoking, alcohol, work, stress, caffeine (tea,
coffee, cola) intake and any illegal drug use. These may
contribute to extrasystoles.
A history of ischaemic and valvular heart disease
(including previous rheumatic fever) should be sought.
This needs to be made prominent in the PMH as structural heart problems will predispose to pathological
arrhythmias.
A family history of palpitations or sudden cardiac
death may be important (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy or long QT syndromes).
A full drug history of both prescribed and overthe-counter medications is essential. Remember, many
drugs, both cardiac and non-cardiac, can promote palpitations. Most anti-arrhythmic drugs are also potentially pro-arrhythmic.
Non-cardiac causes of sinus tachycardia and causes
of sinus bradycardia are outlined in Figs 6.2 and 6.3,
respectively.
Non-cardiac causes of palpitations include the
following:
• Thyrotoxicosis: may cause sinus tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter/
fibrillation.

Fig. 6.2 Non-cardiac causes of sinus tachycardia.

• Hypothyroidism (myxedema): may be responsible

• Anxiety: a very common cause of palpitations.

CONSEQUENCES OF
PALPITATIONS
Palpitations can cause a range of problems, from minor
anxiety to syncope or sudden death. This accounts for
much of the patient’s concern. If a benign arrhythmia is
present, reassurance that the condition is not serious is
often all that is required. Changes in rate may be more serious, compromising coronary blood supply and leading
to symptoms of myocardial ischaemia or cardiac failure.
Tachycardia or bradycardia may lead to a reduction
in cardiac output and cause dizziness or collapse (e.g.
Stokes–Adams attacks in complete heart block). Ventricular tachycardia is potentially life-threatening.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
PALPITATIONS
A guide to examining the patient with palpitations is
given in Fig. 6.4. Look for signs of systemic diseases.
Next feel the pulse. Note the following:

• Rate: beats per minute.
• Rhythm: regular, regularly irregular (e.g. Wenckebach second-degree heart block), irregularly irregular: e.g. multiple ectopic beats or atrial fibrillation.
• Volume/character: e.g. a collapsing pulse of hyperdynamic circulation or a low-volume pulse of shock
or aortic stenosis. Remember this may be positional,
so raising the arm above the heart may exaggerate a
collapsing pulse.
If the patient is symptom-free at the time of examination, the pulse may be normal.
The blood pressure will be low if the arrhythmia
leads to a reduction in cardiac output. Hypertension
may predispose to atrial fibrillation.
The jugular venous pressure may be elevated if cardiac failure is present. Irregular cannon ‘a’ waves are visible with complete heart block, and ‘a’ waves are absent
in atrial fibrillation.
A displaced apex may indicate cardiomyopathy. Feel
for heaves and thrills with associated right ventricular
enlargement and valvular heart disease. Assess the rate
and rhythm by auscultation. The pulse rate felt at the

radial artery may be slower than the apical rate in atrial
fibrillation (pulse deficit). Listen for cardiac murmurs
(e.g. evidence of mitral valve disease, mitral valve prolapse). Focus on any abnormal findings (see Ch. 30).
HINTS AND TIPS
An irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation) is
irregular in BOTH rhythm AND volume.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH PALPITATIONS
The following tests should be performed.

Vital signs
• Pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and saturations.
• Pulse oximetry.

51

Palpitations

Blood tests
• Full blood count: anaemia.
• Urea and electrolytes: disturbances of potassium or,
less commonly, magnesium and calcium may contribute to refractory arrhythmias.
• Thyroid function tests: hypo/hyperthyroidism.
• Drug concentration if appropriate (e.g. digoxin
levels in suspected toxicity).

Other tests
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG): although mandatory for everyone with palpitations, this test rarely provides the diagnosis as it is unlikely that they will be
caught on a resting 12-lead ECG. Wolff–Parkinson–
White syndrome will be seen at rest, as will atrial fibrillation. Ectopic beats may be seen. Careful analysis of
the QRS morphology and QT interval, etc., may be
important.
• 24-h ECG: for intermittent symptoms. It should be
carried out with a diary of symptoms to see if they
correlate with any rhythm disturbances found.

52

• Echocardiogram: to exclude any underlying structural heart disease.
• ‘Cardiomemo’: if symptoms do not occur every day,
a ‘cardiomemo’ can record the heart rhythm at the
press of a button.
• Exercise test: the induction of symptoms under controlled conditions with ECG monitoring may be
appropriate.
• Electrophysiological studies: more rarely, patients
may be referred for specialized studies. These can
be used to induce arrhythmias, locate the origin of
any arrhythmic foci, assess the response to drug
treatment or destroy any aberrant pathway via radiofrequency ablation.

HINTS AND TIPS
Atrial fibrillation with a fast ventricular response
(‘fast AF’) is easily confused with a regular tachycardia
when assessing the pulse.

Cough and haemoptysis

7

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Know the classification and causes of cough and haemoptysis.
• Have a systematic approach to assessing a patient presenting with cough or haemoptysis.
• Have a logical approach to investigating patients with cough or haemoptysis.

INTRODUCTION
Cough is a non-specific reaction to irritation anywhere
in the respiratory tract from the pharynx to the alveoli.
The most common cause is infection, bacterial or viral.
‘Acute cough’ is defined as cough of <3 weeks’ duration
and if it persists for >8 weeks it becomes a ‘chronic
cough’ and subacute if somewhere in between. As most
viral upper respiratory tract infections will have resolved
within 3 weeks, any cough lasting >8 weeks or >3 weeks
with other symptoms warrants systematic investigation.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
COUGH AND/OR HAEMOPTYSIS

Cough
The differential diagnosis of cough includes:
• Postnasal drip: rhinitis, sinusitis.
• Upper respiratory tract infections: viral or bacterial,
causing laryngitis, tracheobronchitis, etc.
• Pressure on the trachea: e.g. from a goitre; this may
be associated with stridor.
• Lower respiratory tract causes: almost any lung pathology may be associated with cough, in particular
asthma (classically a nocturnal cough), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia,
bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease and carcinoma.
• Left ventricular failure.
• Drugs: especially angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors and irritants, e.g. occupational agents.
• Psychogenic/habitual cough.
• Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD): reflux is
a common cause of chronic cough and may not be
obvious from symptoms.

Haemoptysis
Common causes of haemoptysis include the following:
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00007-5

• Acute infections: e.g. pneumonia, exacerbations of
COPD.
• Bronchiectasis: can be responsible for massive
haemoptysis.
• Bronchial carcinoma: secondary malignancies and
benign tumours can also lead to haemoptysis but
are less common.
• Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB): a common cause
worldwide.
• Other chronic infection: e.g. lung abscess, pulmonary aspergillosis.
• Pulmonary embolus: due to lung infarction.
• Left ventricular failure: typically pink, frothy sputum.
• Alveolar haemorrhage: usually due to a systemic vasculitis, e.g. Goodpasture’s syndrome and Wegener’s
granulomatosis.
• Trauma: e.g. contusions to the chest, inhalation of
foreign bodies or after intubation.
Rare causes of haemoptysis include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Bleeding diatheses.
Interstitial lung disease.
Mitral stenosis.
Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis.
Arteriovenous malformations: Osler–Weber–Rendu
disease (hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia), a
favourite in exams but rare in practice.
• Eisenmenger’s syndrome.
• Pulmonary hypertension.
• Cystic fibrosis.
In up to 15% of cases, no cause for haemoptysis is found.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
COUGH AND HAEMOPTYSIS
The nature of the cough may help in diagnosis
(Fig. 7.1). Assess the following in patients with cough
or haemoptysis:
• How severe is the cough and how disabling has it
become to the patient’s life?

53

Cough and haemoptysis

Pressure on trachea ‘Brassy’ cough – hard and metallic
Tracheitis

‘Hot poker’ cough – often
associated with retrosternal pain

Laryngeal nerve
paralysis (e.g.

with hoarse voice

‘Seal’ cough – barking, hoarse
cough

Pharyngitis

‘Hacking’ cough – frequent,

Small airways
(e.g. asthma)

‘Wheezy’ cough – often associated
with shortness of breath

• How long has the cough been present? The longer a
cough is present, the less likely it is to be due to infection and other diagnoses should be sought.
• Is the cough worse at night? Cough can be the only
symptom of asthma.
• Weight loss or other systemic symptoms? Think of
carcinoma or lung abscess.
• Has the patient been in contact with any person with
infection? Think of TB, especially in at-risk patient
groups.
• History of chest trauma?
• Post-nasal drip: the sensation of dripping in the back
of the throat causing a ‘throat clearing’ cough.
• Any prior medical history, e.g. cystic fibrosis, rheumatic fever–haemoptysis or lung transplantation
needing immunosuppressive drugs.
• GORD: the lack of overt indigestion or waterbrash
doesn’t exclude reflux as a cause of chronic cough.
• Family history of bleeding disorders?
• Drug history, in particular ACE inhibitors. Of people
taking ACE inhibitors, 10–20% will have a dry, tickly
cough. It is thought to be related to increased levels
of bradykinin. It is more common in women than in
men. Angiotensin receptor antagonists are better tolerated as they do not interact with the bradykinin activation pathway.
• A travel history may suggest more rare diagnoses.
• Cigarette smoking? This can cause a cough in its own
right by acting as an irritant but is strongly associated
with bronchial malignancy.
• Occupational agents or exposure to dusts that might
account for the cough?
HINTS AND TIPS
Be sure what the patient means by ‘coughing up
blood’. It is confused with epistaxis and haematemesis
more times than you would believe!

54

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
COUGH AND HAEMOPTYSIS
A full general and respiratory examination should
be carried out (Fig. 7.2 and see Ch. 31). Assess the
following:
• If the patient is breathless, assess the severity by observing respiratory rate and the work of breathing
(e.g. using accessory muscles).
• Anaemia: if present, think of malignancy, connective
tissue diseases or chronic infection.
• Finger clubbing: suspect bronchial carcinoma, lung
abscess, mesothelioma, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis or fibrosing alveolitis. Whilst looking at the nails,
always look for tar staining
• Cyanosis: hypoxaemia, acute (e.g. pneumonia) or
chronic (e.g. COPD, interstitial lung disease).
• Lymphadenopathy: infection or malignancy.
• Look in the sputum pot if the cough is productive.
• Examine for a goitre. Is there retrosternal extension?
• Signs of bronchial carcinoma: e.g. Horner’s syndrome, paraneoplastic syndromes.
• Examine the legs for deep vein thromboses: pulmonary embolus (PE) causing haemoptysis.
• Skin: systemic vasculitides may have skin manifestations.
• Facial pain in sinusitis.
• Full respiratory examination: auscultate for bronchial breathing in lobar consolidation, fine crepitations with left ventricular failure or interstitial lung
disease and the coarser crepitations of bronchiectasis.
A pleural rub may indicate pulmonary infarction.
• Full cardiac examination: auscultate for murmurs,
especially mitral stenosis or a pericardial rub.
• Pulmonary hypertension: loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular
heave, a pulmonary systolic murmur and prominent
‘a’ waves in the jugular venous pressure.
• A localized monophonic wheeze, not disappearing
on coughing, suggests a blocked major airway from
a carcinoma or a foreign body.
HINTS AND TIPS
Never forget tuberculosis. It is not a historical disease
and is easily overlooked.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH COUGH AND HAEMOPTYSIS

Imaging

• Vital signs: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, temperature.
• Peak expiratory flow rate.
• Sputum: acid-fast bacillus test (AFBs) for TB, microscopy, culture and cytology.

• Chest radiograph: may reveal the pulmonary cause
of the cough (e.g. pneumonia, carcinoma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy in sarcoidosis or tuberculosis).
• CT (sometimes HRCT): to assess malignancy, interstitial lung disease and bronchiectasis.
• CT pulmonary angiogram: if a PE is suspected.
• Sinus X-rays or computed tomography (CT).

Blood tests
• Full blood count: anaemia with malignancies, white
cell count with infection, pulmonary eosinophilia.
• Urea and electrolytes: check renal function if vasculitis suspected. Electrolytes may be deranged in malignancy (e.g. small cell carcinoma releasing ADH).
• Arterial blood gas analysis.

Further tests
• Pharyngoscopy: if an upper respiratory cause is
suspected.

55

Cough and haemoptysis
• Bronchoscopy with or without washings, brushings
or biopsies.
• Endobronchial ultrasound  FNA.
• Peak flow diary: asthma.
• Simple spirometry: if airways disease is suspected.

56

• Specific lung function tests: if the cause has not
been found after the above tests have been carried
out (see Ch. 31).
• Gastroscopy, barium swallow or 24-h oesophageal
pH recording: to investigate possible GORD.

Pyrexia of unknown origin

8

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The causes of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO).
• How to assess a patient with PUO thoroughly.
• The pattern of investigation in a patient with PUO.

INTRODUCTION
Fever is a common symptom and a cause is often obvious, such as viral respiratory tract infection. Pyrexia of
unknown origin (PUO), also called fever of unknown
origin, is defined as a persistent and unexplained fever
lasting at least three weeks where a diagnosis has not
been reached despite three days of investigation in hospital or three outpatient visits.

CAUSES OF PUO
There is a wide differential diagnosis; the causes can be
broadly classified as in Fig. 8.1. The most common
malignancy to cause fever is lymphoma, although
PUO can also be attributed to solid tumours, particularly renal cell and gastrointestinal carcinoma.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT
WITH PUO
This must be thorough. The systemic enquiry must be
rigorous and every symptom explored in detail. Pay particular attention to
• Past medical history, particularly recurrent infection
and immunosuppression.
• Surgical history, including complications, and any
history of accidents.
• Travel: has there been exposure to endemic diseases
(e.g. malaria, histoplasmosis)? The incubation period of many tropical diseases may mean that the
symptoms start after arrival back home.
• Contact with animals, both domestic and wild,
which may suggest zoonoses, e.g. leptospirosis,
Q fever (coxiellosis), salmonellosis, cat-scratch

disease (bartonellosis), psittacoses and ornithoses,
toxoplasmosis, hydatid disease, toxocariasis, meningitis, anthrax.
Is there clear exposure to disease-carrying vectors:
ticks (e.g. borreliosis, tick typhus), mosquitoes (e.g.
malaria, dengue), sand flies (e.g. leishmaniasis).
Contact with infected people.
Sexual history: specifics of sexual practice may be
helpful.
IV drug use and sharing of needles.
Drug history, including over-the-counter medication and any drugs recently started.
Alcohol intake.
Immunization history.
Family history: may point to inherited disorders
such as familial Mediterranean fever.
Symptoms: such as sweats, weight loss, itch, lumps
and rash.

Further information can often be obtained by repeating
the history to look for additional or missed clues which
may point to the diagnosis.
COMMUNICATION
A thorough sexual history is important and becomes
easier to elicit with practice.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT
WITH PUO
The examination of a patient with PUO is shown in
Fig. 8.2. It must be especially thorough and should be
repeated frequently. Remember to pay attention to:
• Teeth and throat (e.g. periodontal disease/dental
abscess).
• Joint signs and temporal artery tenderness.

pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO).

• Heart murmurs and stigmata of endocarditis.
• Rectal and vaginal examinations (abscesses, masses,
retained tampon).

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH PUO
Investigations are best directed by the history and examination; for example, if the patient has recently returned
from an area where malaria is endemic, thick and thin
blood films should be requested. Frequently there will
be few clues, and the best way to proceed is to request
general non-specific screening tests, the results of which
may direct further investigation.

Full blood count and differential
white cell count
The full blood count may yield useful information
though it is often non-specific:

Ears
— Otitis media
Mouth
— Dental/pharyngeal
sepsis

Lungs
— Respiratory
examination

Liver
— Hepatomegaly
— Hepatic bruit

Rectum/vagina
— Rectal/vaginal
masses and
infections
Nervous system
— Abnormalities of
central and peripheral
nervous system

Legs
— Deep venous
thrombosis

Eyes
— Conjunctival petechiae
— Jaundice
Lymph nodes
— Lymphadenopathy
Heart

Kidneys
— Renal cell carcinoma

Hands
— Nail-fold infarcts:
rash, nodules, papules

Joints
— Active infection or
inflammation
Skin
— Rashes

Investigating the patient with PUO
• Neutrophilia: bacterial infections, myeloproliferative disease, malignancy (esp. fast-growing neoplasms), connective tissue disease.
• Lymphocytosis: acute viral infection, chronic intracellular bacterial infection, e.g. tuberculosis and brucellosis, protozoal infection.
• Monocytosis: subacute bacterial endocarditis, inflammatory disease such as Crohn’s disease and connective tissue disease, Hodgkin’s disease, brucellosis,
tuberculosis.
• Atypical lymphocytosis: infectious mononucleosis
(acute Epstein–Barr virus infection), cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis.
• Leukopenia: viral infections, lymphoma, systemic
lupus erythematosus, brucellosis, disseminated
tuberculosis, drugs.
• Eosinophilia: helminth infection (e.g. schistosomiasis, filariasis), malignancy (especially Hodgkin’s
disease), drug reaction, pulmonary eosinophilia.

Inflammatory markers
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be raised
in any condition causing inflammation. A very high ESR
suggests the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Multiple myeloma.
Systemic lupus erythematosus.
Temporal (giant cell) arteritis.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
Still’s disease.
Rheumatic fever.
Lymphoma.
Subacute bacterial endocarditis.

Plasma viscosity provides similar information to ESR.
C-reactive protein is an ‘acute-phase reactant’ produced
by the liver which, although non-specific, is useful for
monitoring disease progress as its level varies more rapidly than ESR due to its short half-life.

Urea and electrolytes
Assessment of urea and electrolytes may reveal renal
impairment or electrolyte abnormalities due to the
underlying disease, for instance renal impairment in
vasculitis.

Liver function tests
Abnormal results suggest further investigation of the liver
may be helpful. Note that alkaline phosphatase may also
be raised in metabolic bone disease, Hodgkin’s disease,
Still’s disease, polymyalgia rheumatica and patients with
bony metastases; if the gamma GT is also raised it suggests the source is hepatic. Mild derangement of liver

8

function is often seen in serious systemic illness, and
any abnormality should be monitored closely.

Bacteriology, serology and
viral load
Samples should be taken from any possible site and sent
for microscopy and culture:
• Urine: bacteria (infections), haematuria (e.g. bacterial endocarditis, renal cell carcinoma). Early morning urine for renal tract TB.
• Blood: taking several samples from different sites at
different times will increase the yield of results.
• Faeces: microscopy for ova, cysts and parasites; culture for bacteria; tests for C. difficile toxin.
• Vaginal and cervical swabs.
• Urethral swabs in men.
• Sputum microscopy and culture; induced sputum
may be required.
• Throat swab cultures.
• Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid: if lumbar
puncture or bone marrow aspiration is performed,
samples should be sent for culture including TB.
Many specific serological tests are available, often detecting both IgG and IgM levels, and should be performed as
directed by the history and examination. Raised IgM
levels may indicate acute infection, but a positive IgG
result may need to be repeated to look for a rising titre.
Occasionally serology is performed ‘blindly’ if there are
no clues as to the diagnosis. An HIV test should be considered in anyone presenting with PUO.
In certain circumstances it may be useful to check
and monitor the viral load (e.g. CMV, EBV, HIV).

Chest X-ray
This may show, for instance, tuberculosis, abscess or
lymphadenopathy.

Further investigations
These are best directed by clinical findings and the results of initial tests, but it may be necessary to proceed
‘blindly’. Non-invasive tests should be performed first.
In this case, the following are reasonable initial
investigations:
• Autoimmune screen including rheumatoid factor,
extractable nuclear antigens and ANCA.
• Immunoglobulins and protein electrophoresis.
• Interferon release assay for TB (e.g. QuantiFERON/
T-spot).
• Antistreptolysin-O titre and tumour markers.
• Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.

59

Pyrexia of unknown origin
All non-essential drugs should be stopped on admission. It may be necessary to withhold other drugs,
and the response monitored. If there is still no clue as
to the cause, the system most likely to be responsible
should be investigated and the following tests may be
considered:
• Echocardiogram (transthoracic or transoesophageal).
• CT scan of chest with contrast, bronchoscopy and
bronchoalveolar lavage.
• Bone marrow biopsy and culture.
• FDG-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) or
white cell scintigraphy.
• Temporal artery biopsy if patient aged over 55.
• Lumbar puncture, lymph node biopsy or liver
biopsy.
• Exploratory laparoscopy is occasionally needed.

60

Rare causes should be considered including hyperthyroidism, phaeochromocytoma and familial Mediterranean fever.
Factitious fever is deliberate manipulation of the
thermometer, classically said to occur in young women,
and should be considered if no other cause can be found
and the patient looks inappropriately well despite fever.
If all else fails, consideration should be given to blind
treatment, for instance treating suspected TB with antituberculous chemotherapy, endocarditis with antibiotics and vasculitides with steroids.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember to go over the history and examination
repeatedly, even when investigations are in progress.

Dyspepsia

9

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the differential diagnosis of dyspepsia.
• Have a systematic approach to assessing a patient presenting with dyspepsia.
• Have a logical approach to investigating patients with dyspepsia.

INTRODUCTION
Dyspepsia describes a group of symptoms that relate to
the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These symptoms
include upper abdominal discomfort, retrosternal pain,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, bloating, fullness, heartburn and early satiety. The prevalence of these symptoms have been estimated between 20 and 30%.
The approach to this common presenting complaint
involves directing investigations towards those most
likely to benefit (e.g. those at risk of cancer where a firm
endoscopic/histological diagnosis must be made) as opposed to those in whom empirical therapy is safe and a
firm diagnosis would not significantly alter their management (e.g. a young, otherwise well, patient with
dyspepsia and no Helicobacter pylori infection).

•

•
•

CAUSES OF DYSPEPSIA
•
This chapter emphasizes that it is not always essential to
make a firm diagnosis in the dyspeptic patient in order
to treat them appropriately. However, a definitive
diagnosis may be reached following investigation or if
further investigations are performed at the discretion
of the clinician, perhaps due to persistent, uncontrolled
symptoms. The causes of dyspepsia are shown in
Fig. 9.1.

HISTORY AND EXAMINATION IN
THE PATIENT WITH DYSPEPSIA
The following features should be asked for, although the
precise symptoms correlate poorly with the underlying
cause:
• Heartburn: usually retrosternal and often worse with
leaning forward or lying down. Suggestive of acid
reflux and may be associated with ‘waterbrash’, a
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00009-9

flood of saliva in the mouth as a reflex response to
acid in the lower oesophagus.
Chest pain: burning retrosternal pain, not related
to exertion (unlike angina), which may radiate
between the shoulder blades. This can relate to
acid-provoked oesophageal spasm, which, like angina, is relieved by nitrates.
Nocturnal cough/asthma: occasionally due to acid
reflux.
Aggravating factors for reflux:
• increased intra-abdominal pressure: stooping/
bending/obesity/pregnancy
• spicy or fatty foods
• alcohol ingestion: also causes gastritis
• cigarettes, caffeine, theophylline, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, anticholinergic drugs:
reduce lower oesophageal sphincter tone
• non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
interfere with prostaglandin cytoprotection
• hiatus hernia.
Epigastric pain: feature of peptic ulcer disease. Aggravated by food (gastric ulcer) or fasting (duodenal
ulcer), but not always.

The most important part of the assessment in these
patients is to identify those who require endoscopic investigation (see below). This depends on the presence of
the ‘red flag symptoms or signs’ listed in Fig. 9.2, which
MUST be looked for specifically. These features all
suggest an elevated risk of cancer and help to ensure that
endoscopy is not denied to those at risk of cancer.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH DYSPEPSIA
An approach to the dyspeptic patient is outlined in
Fig. 9.3. The management of specific conditions is
further explained in Ch. 32.

Investigating the patient with dyspepsia
as persistent symptoms not responding to the approach
in Fig. 9.3 or atypical symptoms (e.g. laryngeal discomfort or atypical chest pain that may result from acid reflux or oesophageal dysmotility). It is important to
remember that the majority of patients with dyspepsia
can be managed safely without extensive investigations
provided the algorithm in Fig. 9.3 is adhered to.
HINTS AND TIPS
Although dyspepsia or heartburn is usually a
gastrointestinal complaint, some older patients with
‘dyspepsia’ turn out to have angina pectoris. Make sure
you question the patient carefully to ensure that the
problem is gastrointestinal in origin.

Common investigations
• Full blood count: microcytic anaemia and/or thrombocytosis may suggest gastrointestinal blood loss
and needs urgent further investigation.
• Electrocardiography (ECG): if considering the diagnosis of angina in cases of atypical chest pain. Acid
reflux can cause non-specific ECG changes and
therefore further investigations such as exercise tolerance testing may be necessary.
• Helicobacter pylori testing: several tests are available.
Carbon-tagged breath tests (depend on urease

9

breakdown of urea) are the most accurate and can
confirm eradication following treatment (but cannot be used in patients taking proton pump inhibitors, bismuth or within 4 weeks of antibiotic use).
Immunoglobulin G serological tests confirm previous infection but cannot provide information on
eradication and have a high false-positive rate and
are therefore not reliable and should not be used.
Urease tests can be used on endoscopic specimens
and histology/culture can confirm these findings.
• Endoscopy (oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, OGD):
very safe but not totally risk-free (4 in 100 000).
Allows visualization of the upper gastrointestinal
tract to the second part of the duodenum and
biopsy and therapeutic manoeuvres if required
(see Ch. 32).
• Barium meal: alternative for patients in whom endoscopy is not possible, e.g. elderly frail patients
in whom sedation is dangerous.

Specialized investigations
• Oesophageal motility studies: manometry demonstrates motility disorders (e.g. achalasia, systemic
sclerosis, diffuse oesophageal spasm).
• 24-h intraluminal pH monitoring: confirms acid reflux in difficult cases.
• Abdominal ultrasound: if a mass or biliary pathology is suspected (see Ch. 32).

Haematemesis and melaena

10

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Know the causes of haematemesis and melaena.
• Assess a patient with haematemesis and melaena, particularly in an emergency.
• Understand the investigations of haematemesis and melaena.

INTRODUCTION
Haematemesis is the vomiting of fresh (bright red) or
altered (‘coffee grounds’) blood. Melaena is the production of black, tarry stools, and is due to bleeding
in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract usually above the hepatic flexure. Both are typical signs of an upper GI
bleed. GI bleeding is an emergency, and treatment is
usually initiated before a diagnosis has been made
(see Ch. 32).

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF HAEMATEMESIS AND
MELAENA
Fig. 10.1 gives the differential diagnosis of haematemesis and melaena. It is important to note that melaena
alone may be caused by pathology in the small bowel
or ascending colon.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT
WITH HAEMATEMESIS AND
MELAENA
The history may have to be taken after initial resuscitation procedures. It is important to determine whether
the blood has been vomited or coughed. In cases of difficulty, the presence of food mixed with the blood or an
acid pH is suggestive of haematemesis, although the
vomitus may not be acidic in patients with carcinoma
of the stomach.
Haematemesis may be due to blood swallowed from
the nasopharynx or mouth. You must ask about the
following.

© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00010-5

Presenting complaint
• Non-specific symptoms of hypovolaemia: faintness,
weakness, dizziness, sweating, palpitations, dyspnoea, pallor, collapse. These symptoms may precede
the actual haematemesis/melaena.
• Symptoms of chronic blood loss: suggests gastric carcinoma if associated with anorexia and weight loss.
• Heartburn: oesophagitis.
• Weight loss and anorexia: carcinoma.
• Dysphagia or odynophagia (pain on swallowing):
oesophageal carcinoma or oesophagitis.
• Retching, especially after an alcohol binge: Mallory–
Weiss tear.
• Sudden severe abdominal pain: possible bowel
perforation.
• Intermittent epigastric pain relieved with antacids:
peptic ulceration.

Other important points
• Current drugs: aspirin, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, steroids or excessive alcohol
are suggestive of gastric erosions; iron therapy causes
black stools but this is not melaena; anticoagulation
will exacerbate bleeding.
• Chronic excessive alcohol intake and other causes of
liver disease (see Ch. 13): oesophageal varices.
• A past history of GI bleeds and their cause.
• Family history: inherited bleeding disorders.

the patient for a few seconds. Do they look well,
or pale and clammy? An initial commonsense impression affects the immediacy of subsequent management. The first priority in a patient with active
bleeding is to follow the ABC principles, which include obtaining good venous access and starting
appropriate fluid replacement.
• Clubbing: inflammatory bowel disease, cirrhosis.
• Pulse and blood pressure: tachycardia is a reflex response to hypovolaemia (due to bleeding) and usually precedes a blood pressure fall. A young and
healthy patient may lose more than 500 mL of
blood before a rise in heart rate or fall in blood pressure occurs. If the patient is hypotensive, IV fluid resuscitation is imperative, as is frequent monitoring
of pulse and blood pressure to assess haemodynamic trends.
• Skin: bruises, purpura (bleeding disorders); telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu disease (hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia – autosomal dominant));
neurofibromata; pale (shut down)
• Jaundice: may indicate portal hypertension and clotting abnormality.
• Anaemia: mucous membranes. If clinically anaemic,
this may indicate chronic blood loss.
• Lymphadenopathy: especially Virchow’s node (left
supraclavicular lymph node) associated with gastric
carcinoma (Troisier’s sign).
• Mouth: pharyngeal lesions; pigmented macules
(Peutz–Jeghers syndrome).

Investigating the patient with haematemesis and melaena
• Cachexia.
• A rigid abdomen suggests bowel perforation.
• Epigastric tenderness suggests peptic ulcer disease,
oesophagitis, hiatus hernia or gastric carcinoma.
• Epigastric mass: gastric carcinoma.
• If malignancy is suspected, examine for metastases.
• Signs of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension support the possibility of oesophageal varices
(see Ch. 13).

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH HAEMATEMESIS AND
MELAENA
HINTS AND TIPS
A large upper GI bleed may cause the passage of
fresh blood per rectum rather than melaena; in this
setting the patient is likely to be haemodynamically
unstable.

An algorithm for the investigation of the patient with
haematemesis and melaena is given in Fig. 10.3. The following investigations should be carried out which will
aid in diagnosis as well as contribute to predicting associated mortality (Figs 10.4 and 10.5)

Bedside
• Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and
oxygen saturations.

Blood tests
• A full blood count should be performed. The haemoglobin may be normal in the acute phase, despite
a large GI bleed, as it takes some hours for haemodilution to occur. A low haemoglobin on initial presentation and/or a low mean corpuscular volume
(MCV) suggests chronic blood loss, and the white
cell count may be raised after a GI bleed. Platelet
count may be reduced after an acute bleed or increased after chronic blood loss. A very low platelet
count should raise suspicion of a bleeding diathesis.
• Group and save even if there is only a small GI bleed
and the patient is haemodynamically stable. Blood
should be cross-matched for more significant
bleeding.
• A clotting screen should also be performed, as the
prothrombin time is raised in liver disease. More

10

specific investigations may be indicated (e.g. in
patients with haemophilia or von Willebrand’s
disease).
• Urea is raised because of the absorption and subsequent breakdown of protein when blood reaches
the small bowel. Intravascular volume depletion
causing prerenal impairment also contributes.

Further investigations
• On erect chest X-ray, the presence of gas under the
right hemidiaphragm indicates bowel perforation.
• Endoscopy (gastroscopy) is usually performed
within 24 h if the patient is shocked or has significant co-morbidity, immediately if variceal bleeding
is suspected. It allows direct visualization of the pathology and provides a diagnosis in around 90% of
cases. This will determine the most appropriate form
of medical therapy. The risk of rebleeding (the major
cause of mortality) may be estimated. Treatment
may be given endoscopically (e.g. banding or sclerosing a bleeding varix, or adrenaline (epinephrine)
injection of a bleeding vessel). If the endoscopy is
negative, a colonoscopy should be performed to rule
out a proximal colonic bleed.
• Barium examinations are becoming less common as
endoscopy is becoming more widely available.
Most patients do not require further tests but occasionally these are performed under the guidance of a specialist when the diagnosis remains uncertain (see Fig. 10.3):
• Isotope studies: abdominal gamma scanning can detect extravasation of radioisotope-labelled red blood
cells if active bleeding is present. These are now very
rarely undertaken.
• Mesenteric angiography again requires active bleeding to localize the source. It can also be used to visualize the portal venous system.
• CT/MRI  capsule endoscopy are modern means of
investigating small intestinal pathology.
• Diagnostic laparoscopy before laparotomy and surgically assisted enteroscopy are occasionally performed.
Despite extensive investigation, a small minority of patients will remain undiagnosed. If bleeding is severe,
laparotomy may be required but if it is not severe the
patient may attend for repeat ‘top-up’ transfusions or
iron infusions as required.
HINTS AND TIPS
Elevated blood urea with normal serum creatinine
suggests gastrointestinal blood loss.

Change in bowel habit

11

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Know the causes of diarrhoea and constipation.
• Assess patients with altered bowel habit.
• Understand the pattern of investigation for patients with altered bowel habit.

INTRODUCTION
Always ask about the patient’s normal bowel habit because there are considerable differences between people, usually varying from three times a day to once
every 3 days. Changes in a patient’s usual bowel habit
are important and may suggest an underlying pathology. Constipation is defined as abnormally delayed
or infrequent passage of dry hardened stool. Diarrhoea
is defined as abnormally frequent intestinal evacuations with more or less fluid stools. Figs 11.1 and 11.2
summarize the causes of diarrhoea and constipation,
respectively.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF A
CHANGE IN BOWEL HABIT
HINTS AND TIPS
Make sure that by ‘constipation’ and ‘diarrhoea’ you
and the patient mean the same thing.

HINTS AND TIPS
Note the features of acute GI obstruction: absolute
constipation, vomiting, pain and abdominal distension.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00011-7

Presenting complaint
• Normal bowel habit and diet.
• Onset: sudden or chronic. Infectious diarrhoea is
usually of acute onset.
• Frequency of defecation.
• Stool appearance: formed, loose or watery; colour –
normal, red (blood from low in the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract), black (melaena), yellow (mucus and
slime), ‘redcurrant jelly’ (intussusception), puttycoloured (obstructive jaundice); volume; do the stools
float? (high fat content – think of malabsorption).
• Associated features (e.g. pain, fever, vomiting,
weight loss, extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease) (see Ch. 32).
• Nocturnal symptoms: these go against a functional
disorder.
• Tenesmus (a sense of incomplete voiding).
• Smell: offensively malodorous in malabsorption;
characteristic smell of melaena.
• Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.

Other important points
•
•

•

Relationship to food.
Contact with diarrhoea sufferers.
Stress.

Drugs: antacids, laxatives, cimetidine, digoxin, antibiotics, alcohol.
• Surgical history (e.g. multiple bowel resections for
Crohn’s disease can result in malabsorption).

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH A CHANGE IN BOWEL HABIT
The wide range of possible diagnoses in patients with
altered bowel habit is reflected by the large number of
tests that may be performed. Some of these are used
commonly, whereas others are used much less frequently and only under the guidance of specialists.

Common investigations
Blood tests
• Full blood count.
• Urea and electrolytes, including calcium.

72

•
•
•
•

Thyroid function tests.
Blood glucose: diabetes.
Liver function tests.
Albumin: decreased in malabsorption, proteinlosing enteropathies, inflammatory diseases.
• In malabsorption: anaemia – vitamin B12, folate, iron;
hyponatraemia in profound secretory diarrhoea;
reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins – prolonged
prothrombin time (vitamin K), hypocalcaemia
(vitamin D), visual impairment rarely (vitamin A).
• Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies if suspect
coeliac disease.
• Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation
rate and C-reactive protein) – raised in infection/
inflammation. Many centres now measure plasma
viscosity.

Imaging
• Abdominal X-ray: pancreatic calcification suggests
chronic pancreatitis, distended intestinal loops and
fluid levels suggest obstruction, and gross dilatation
of the colon suggests Hirschsprung’s disease (rare).
Featureless colon, with loss of haustral markings,
may indicate colitis.
• Abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography for suspected masses and pancreatitis. Or MRI

Weight loss

12

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the many causes of weight loss.
• Have a logical approach to assessing the patient with involuntary weight loss.
• Know how to direct investigations in a patient with weight loss.

INTRODUCTION
Weight loss is due to either a decreased energy intake or
increased energy output, or both. Involuntary weight
loss is a common manifestation of physical or psychological illness and always warrants further investigation.
It should be confirmed objectively with records of previous weights. If this is not possible, a change in clothes
size gives a useful clue. Family members may be able to
give a more objective history.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
WEIGHT LOSS
Distinguish deliberate from involuntary weight loss
from the outset. Fig. 12.1 summarizes the differential diagnosis of weight loss.
HINTS AND TIPS
Malignancies anywhere that produce a high metabolic
rate or which lead to anorexia or dysphagia (e.g.
oesophageal carcinoma) will result in weight loss.
Therefore malignancy must be excluded in patients
with unexplained weight loss.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
WEIGHT LOSS
Weight loss can be a complication of disease in any
system.
Try to confirm weight loss objectively with records of
previous weights. Ask members of the family or friends
if they have noticed weight loss. Ask about the amount
of weight loss, its duration and any accompanying
symptoms such as anorexia or increased appetite.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00012-9

Further factors to assess, if the cause is not apparent,
include the following.

Presenting complaint
• How much weight has been lost? Over what time
frame? Intentional?
• Diet: detailed intake and any recent changes in diet
history.
• Physical activity: any changes in level.
• Careful GI history: change in bowel habit, melaena,
PR bleeding, change in stool consistency.

Systems review
• Symptoms of chronic infection, inflammation or
malignancy: fever and sweats, rashes, general malaise, anorexia, change in bowel habit, floating stools
(malabsorption), haemoptysis, haematemesis, haematuria, obstructive urinary symptoms (prostate),
melaena (or bleeding from any other site), ‘lumps
and bumps’ (including breast), joint or muscle tenderness, contacts with infected people, dysphagia.
• Symptoms of renal insufficiency: anorexia, general
malaise and lethargy, bruising, urinary symptoms
(e.g. polyuria and nocturia), vomiting, hiccoughs.
• Menstrual history: in premenopausal women significant weight loss may lead to amenorrhoea, particularly in anorexia nervosa.
• Cardiorespiratory symptoms: cardiac cachexia.
• Neurological symptoms.
• Psychiatric symptoms – make sure to do a depression screen and don’t forget anorexia nervosa.
Finally the symptoms of endocrinopathies include the
following:
• Diabetes: polyuria and polydipsia, weakness and fatigue, blurred vision, pruritus or thrush, nocturnal
enuresis.
• Adrenal insufficiency: dizziness and collapses, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea, pigmentation.

Other important points
• Full drug history: including over-the-counter and

• Alcohol intake: with and without associated liver
disease.
• Smoking: if recent onset, this may lead to eating
less; if chronic, assess its association with
malignancies.
HINTS AND TIPS
Many patients with unexplained weight loss fear an
underlying malignancy. It is important to make time to
address these concerns.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
WEIGHT LOSS
The causes of weight loss are multiple and may be associated with pathology of any system. As such it is crucial the clinical examination is thorough, detailed and
complete to pick up any clue regarding the underlying
cause.

The examination approach in the patient with weight
loss is given in Fig. 12.2. Does the patient look like they
have lost weight (loose skin, loose clothes)? Check the
temperature. Does the patient look well or ill? The patient’s weight, height and body mass index should be
documented.

• Leuconychia and palmar erythema: liver disease
(leuconychia reflects hypoalbuminaemia).
• Koilonychia: iron-deficiency anaemia.
• Pigmentation: increased in Addison’s disease
(particularly in palmar creases) but decreased in
anaemia.
• Joint swelling and decreased range of movement:
connective tissue diseases.
• Tremor, goitre and eye signs: hyperthyroidism (see
Fig. 35.7).
• Jaundice and other signs of liver failure (e.g. spider
naevi) (see Ch. 13).
• Muscle wasting.

Examination of individual
systems
The following individual systems should be examined:
• Respiratory system: infection or malignancy.
• Cardiac system.
• Gastrointestinal system: including careful palpation
for abdominal masses, rectal examination and organomegaly (e.g. liver metastases). Always do a digital
rectal examination.
• Neurological system: motor neurone disease, myopathy, paraneoplastic or metastatic manifestations of
malignancy.
• Breast lumps.
• Vaginal examination: pelvic malignancy.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH WEIGHT LOSS
As the potential causes of weight loss are multiple, investigations need to be tailored to the history and clinical examination findings. Nonetheless, the following
investigations should be carried out:

Basic tests
• Full blood count: anaemia with malignancy, iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, or folate deficiency,
with inadequate dietary intake.
• Urea and electrolytes for uraemia and chronic kidney disease.
• Liver function tests (LFTs): liver failure or metastases, although LFTs may be normal with metastases.
• Chest X-ray: infection or tuberculosis, and malignancy.
• Calcium profile: bone metastases.

• Coeliac screen.
• If inflammatory bowel disease is suspected, consider

• Stool culture and microscopy.
• Imaging modalities such as CT/MRI/ultrasound
scan.

Infectious disease
• Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation
rate and C-reactive protein): increased in infection,
inflammation, myeloma and other malignancies.
• Blood cultures.

78

Jaundice

13

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the metabolism of bilirubin.
• Use this as a template for understanding the causes of jaundice.
• Assess the jaundiced patient.
• Understand the investigation of jaundice.

INTRODUCTION
Jaundice (icterus) is the yellow discoloration of the
skin, sclera and mucosae that is detectable when
serum bilirubin concentrations exceed approximately
50 mmol/L. Normal bilirubin metabolism is summarized in Fig. 13.1. Broadly speaking, jaundice can arise
as a result of increased red blood cell (RBC) breakdown,
disordered bilirubin metabolism or reduced bilirubin
excretion.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF JAUNDICE
The causes of jaundice are outlined in Fig. 13.2. ‘Prehepatic’ jaundice usually results from the excessive production of bilirubin by haemolysis (see Fig. 13.1) but
can also result from inherited metabolic defects, the
commonest of which is Gilbert’s syndrome. ‘Hepatic’
jaundice results from hepatocyte dysfunction causing
disordered bilirubin metabolism. It is important to note
that hepatocellular dysfunction usually causes some
cholestasis and may also cause ‘pale stools/dark urine’
(see below). ‘Posthepatic’ jaundice is caused by reduced
bilirubin excretion due to intra- or extrahepatic biliary
obstruction.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT
WITH JAUNDICE
The following factors should be assessed when obtaining a history in a patient with jaundice.

Presenting complaint
• Pruritus, dark urine and pale stools: underlying
cholestasis.
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00013-0

• Abdominal pain: the episodic, colicky, right hypochondrial pain of biliary colic will commonly be
due to gallstones. A dull, persistent epigastric or central pain radiating to the back may suggest a pancreatic carcinoma.
• Fevers or rigors: cholangitis.
• Weight loss: underlying malignancy, particularly
pancreatic cancer.

Other important points
• Duration of illness: a short history of malaise, anorexia
and myalgia are suggestive of viral hepatitis. If there is
a prolonged history of weight loss and anorexia in an
elderly patient, carcinoma is more likely.
• Full recent drug history: particularly paracetamol,
oral contraceptive pill.
• Alcohol consumption: acute alcoholic hepatitis,
cirrhosis.
• Infectious contacts: hepatitis A.
• Recent foreign travel to areas of high hepatitis risk.
• Recent surgery: surgery for known malignancy, biliary stricture due to previous endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (if they had a
sphincterotomy).
• IV drug abuse, tattoos, unprotected sex: increased
risk of hepatitis B and C.
• Occupation: sewage workers are at increased risk of
leptospirosis.
• Family history of recurrent jaundice: inherited haemolytic anaemias and Gilbert’s syndrome.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT
WITH JAUNDICE
The causes of jaundice are multiple and may therefore
indicate underlying pathology in one of many organ
systems. As such it is crucial to perform a detailed

79

Jaundice
clinical examination on any patient that presents with
jaundice. Beyond this, there are three important groups
of abnormalities that should specifically be looked for
in the jaundiced patient:

Erythrocyte breakdown
in the reticulo-endothelial
system

Biliverdin

Unconjugated bilirubin (water-insoluble)
transported to liver bound to albumin

Hepatic conjugation with glucuronic acid

Liver

Conjugated bilirubin

Bacterial action in
terminal ileum

Terminal ileum

Urobilinogen

Systemic circulation

Is there evidence of
encephalopathy?
Encephalopathy is defined as disordered brain function. The following factors suggest the presence of
encephalopathy:

Excretion into bile
and passes to
terminal ileum
Enterohepatic
circulation

• How severe is the jaundice? Is there any evidence of
encephalopathy?
• Is this an acute or chronic problem? Are there any
signs of chronic liver disease?
• Are there any signs of specific disorders? This approach is summarized in Fig. 13.3.

• Drowsiness: this will eventually progress through
stupor to coma.
• Slurred speech.
• Asterixis: flapping tremor of outstretched hands.
• Seizures.
• Constructional apraxia: test by asking the patient to
copy a five-pointed star.
• Hepatic fetor: mercaptans pass directly into the
lungs due to portal hypertension causing a characteristic odour.
Hepatic encephalopathy can arise as a result of fulminating acute liver failure or when chronic disease decompensates. Precipitating factors, grading and management are
described in Ch. 32.

Are there any signs of chronic
liver disease?
There are few clinical signs specific to acute liver disease.
However, the following signs may commonly be found
when liver pathology is long-standing:

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH JAUNDICE
The investigation of jaundiced patients falls into two
stages. First, the type of jaundice must be determined
(prehepatic, hepatic, posthepatic); then, more detailed
tests should be performed to determine the specific
aetiology. Fig. 13.4 summarizes this approach.

Quantification of conjugated bilirubin, along with
measurement of serum liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and bilirubin)
will give a reasonable indication as to the type of abnormality present (Fig. 13.5). Abdominal ultrasound scan
is then essential to exclude biliary obstruction.
The measurement of serum albumin (in the absence
of inflammation) and prothrombin time (reflects

clotting factor synthesis) help to provide an estimate
of hepatic synthetic function.

Tests to determine specific
aetiology
The following tests should be used as guided by the
above initial investigations.

Investigating the patient with jaundice

Hepatocellular screen
• Viral serology: hepatitis A, B and C; Epstein–Barr
virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV).
• Autoantibody screen: antimitochondrial antibodies,
antismooth muscle antibodies, antinuclear antibodies.
• Ferritin: haemochromatosis, transferrin saturation.
• Serum caeruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion:
Wilson’s disease.
• Alpha-1-antitrypsin.
• Liver biopsy: definitive diagnostic test for intrinsic
liver disease.
• Fasting lipid profile: triglycerides for steatosis.

Cholestasis screen
• CT scan: good images of the pancreas, which is often
poorly visualized on an ultrasound scan.

• Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
(MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound: modern techniques for obtaining accurate images of the pancreas
and biliary tree.
• ERCP and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): detailed information regarding the
biliary tree; also used to perform therapeutic
manoeuvres such as bile duct clearance or stent
insertion.

HINTS AND TIPS
Liver dysfunction affects the synthesis of clotting
factors and therefore the prothrombin time must be
checked and corrected before an invasive procedure,
e.g. liver biopsy.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the causes of pain in different regions of the abdomen.
• Assess the patient with abdominal pain.
• Understand the role of investigations in the patient with abdominal pain.

INTRODUCTION
Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint.
Considering the anatomical structures at the site of
the pain will often provide clues to its cause.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
ABDOMINAL PAIN
The differential diagnosis for abdominal pain is multiple and ranges from benign pathology such as mesenteric adenitis to life-threatening pathology such as a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Fig. 14.1 summarizes the common causes of abdominal pain.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
ABDOMINAL PAIN
When a patient presents with abdominal pain, the first
priority is to determine whether he or she has an ‘acute
abdomen’ requiring urgent admission to hospital.
The history should focus on the pain itself (using the
SOCRATES approach) and then associated symptoms.

The presenting complaint
The onset, course, nature and site of the pain must be
accurately assessed.
Sudden onset of sustained severe pain is often due to
perforation or rupture of a viscus, such as the bowel,
spleen or abdominal aorta.
Colicky pain is a griping pain that comes and goes. It
is due to muscular spasm in a viscus wall, such as the
bowel, ureters and gallbladder. The muscles contract
in an attempt to overcome obstruction caused by a
stone, tumour, foreign body, stricture, strangulated hernia or intussusception.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00014-2

Gradual onset with sustained pain can be seen in inflammatory conditions, such as ulcerative colitis or
Crohn’s disease, infection, including abscess formation
or gastroenteritis, and malignancy.
The site and radiation of pain may help to determine
the organ involved (as above). Pancreatic and aortic
pain may radiate to the back (these are retroperitoneal
structures), ureteric pain often radiates from ‘loin to
groin’, and diaphragmatic irritation caused by subphrenic pathology such as an abscess causes referred shoulder tip pain.
Exacerbating and relieving factors may be helpful.
Pain from peritoneal irritation is made much worse
by movement and relieved by keeping still, whereas
patients with colic often curl into a ball and may roll
around.

Associated symptoms
The history should now assess other symptoms that may
suggest the cause of pain or the consequence of the
disease.
Vomiting is common. Haematemesis is seen in upper
gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers or varices, projectile vomiting is seen in pyloric stenosis, and feculent
vomiting results from severe large bowel obstruction.
Ask the patient specifically about the content of the
vomit (bilious, feculent)
Rigors suggest sepsis (e.g. abscess, cholangitis or urinary tract infection). Rigors are particularly common
with Gram-negative septicaemia.
Change in bowel habit may be an important symptom. Absolute constipation (no faeces or wind passed
rectally) indicates complete bowel obstruction, whereas
gastroenteritis or diverticulitis often cause diarrhoea.
Constipation alternating with diarrhoea is a feature of
colonic malignancy but is also seen in irritable bowel
syndrome.
Rectal bleeding may indicate malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, dysentery and

Other important points
The remainder of the history is often relevant and must
be obtained (e.g. past surgical history, ?adhesions), past
medical history (e.g. under follow-up for abdominal
aortic aneurysm), details of any similar previous episodes (e.g. recurrent urinary tract infections), family

the peripheries are may be warm because of vasodilation)
and reduced urine output. Consider sepsis (particularly
Gram-negative), severe bleeding (ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm, splenic rupture), significant fluid loss
(vomiting, diarrhoea, third spacing in bowel obstruction
and pancreatitis) and, rarely, acute Addisonian crisis.

Peritonism

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
ABDOMINAL PAIN
The first question that must be asked is ‘Is the patient
acutely ill?’ Signs of shock and peritonism should be
looked for. The examination should then focus on specific
signs. Fig. 14.2 summarizes the examination approach.

Is the patient acutely unwell?
Pulse and blood pressure
Tachycardia and hypotension indicate shock. Other signs
include delayed capillary refill (beware in sepsis, where

Fig. 14.2 Examining the patient with abdominal pain.

Peritonism is defined as inflammation of the peritoneum. This can be localized or general. The patient often lies still, as movement exacerbates the pain. Look for
rebound tenderness and guarding (involuntary spasm
of the abdominal wall on palpation). When the peritonism becomes generalized, the abdomen will be rigid and
bowel signs will be scanty and high pitched or absent
because of paralysis of peristalsis. Causes of peritonism
are summarized in Fig. 14.3.

What is the underlying cause?
• Pyrexia: high temperature indicates infection; lowgrade pyrexia can be found in malignancy, bowel
infarction, inflammatory bowel disease and
pancreatitis.
• Jaundice: hepatitis, gallstones or pancreatitis (causing periampullary oedema).
• Dehydration: rapid fluid loss.
• Cachexia: suggests a chronic pathology, particularly
malignancy.
• Clubbing: inflammatory bowel disease, small bowel
lymphoma or chronic liver disease.
• Lymphadenopathy: lymphoma; or may be due to
metastases (remember Virchow’s node).
• Cullen’s sign (periumbilical or central bruising) and
Grey Turner’s sign (bruising in the flanks): severe haemorrhagic pancreatitis, rarely leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm. Both are due to retroperitoneal bleeding
• Recent surgical scar: may indicate a source of peritoneal sepsis, such as an anastomotic leak.

Abdominal pain
• Older surgical scar: may indicate presence of
adhesions.
• Abdominal distension: if marked, indicates bowel
obstruction and is accompanied by a resonant percussion note. Occasionally, visible peristalsis may
be present. The abdomen may also be distended in
generalized peritonitis.
• Tenderness: it is important to consider what structures lie at the site of tenderness. As discussed,
rebound tenderness and guarding indicate peritonism.
• Carnett’s sign: this is positive when muscles of the
anterior abdominal wall are tensed and the pain gets
worse; it suggests the abdominal wall, not the abdominal cavity, is the origin of the pain.
• Mass: this can be neoplastic or inflammatory as in
Crohn’s disease.
• Ascites: malignancy, peritoneal sepsis, pancreatitis,
portal hypertension.
• Bowel sounds: high-pitched (tinkling) suggests obstruction; absence indicates an ileus (paralysis of
bowel) from whatever cause.
• Hernial orifices (inguinal and femoral): these must
be examined, particularly if obstruction is suspected.
• Pelvic and rectal examination: pelvic inflammation,
cervical excitation, ectopic pregnancy, rectal mass or
bleeding, stool consistency.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN
All patients admitted to hospital with abdominal pain
should have a full blood count and serum biochemistry
performed. The use of radiology and other tests will depend on a focused differential diagnosis. The diagnostic

Simple tests

Imaging

• Blood glucose: hypoglycaemia will result from liver
failure or Addison’s disease; hyperglycaemia will be
present in ketoacidosis and may complicate acute
pancreatitis.
• Urine dipstick: positive for nitrites and leucocytes indicates UTI; ketone positive may indicate dehydration, anorexia or diabetic ketoacidosis.
• Pregnancy test: any female of childbearing age
presenting with abdominal pain must have a pregnancy test.

• Abdominal X-ray: erect and supine films should be
performed if the following are suspected: perforation (gas under the diaphragm representing free
gas); obstruction (dilated loops of bowel with fluid
level); pancreatitis (sentinel loop due to ileus in
overlying loop of small bowel); infarction (‘thumb
printing’ representing mucosal oedema); renal stone
(90% of such stones are radio-opaque).
• Erect chest X-ray: check for free gas under the
diaphragm – a sign of viscal perforation.
• Abdominal ultrasound scan: dilatation of biliary tree
and ureters; intra-abdominal mass; ascites; abscess.
• CT: useful in diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm, perforation of a viscus. CT pneumocolon
allow for detailed imaging of the colon.

Blood tests
• Full blood count: leucocytosis is seen in infection
and occasionally inflammation and malignancy.
Anaemia may be due to acute blood loss or chronic
pathology such as malignancy.
• Serum amylase: very high in acute pancreatitis but
may also be raised in perforated peptic ulcer, diabetic ketoacidosis, cholecystitis, ectopic pregnancy,
abdominal trauma and myocardial infarction.
• Urea and electrolytes: dehydration, renal failure as a
consequence of obstructive uropathy or shock.
• Serum calcium: hypercalcaemia may cause renal
stones and pancreatitis; hypocalcaemia may be a
consequence of pancreatitis.
• Liver function tests: abnormal in acute hepatitis, biliary disease and shock.

Further investigations
• Urine sample: microscopy, culture and sensitivity of
midstream urine: to exclude infection.
• ECG to rule out myocardial infarction.
• Stool sample: microscopy, culture and sensitivity.
Toxin testing for C. difficile.
• Diagnostic laparoscopy: occasionally the above investigations do not yield a diagnosis and the abdominal pain persists. Diagnostic laparoscopic surgery
can be helpful in making a diagnosis, but is more
commonly useful in ruling out particular pathology.

Urinary symptoms

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The causes of urinary symptoms and their underlying physiological basis.
• How to assess a patient with urinary symptoms.
• How to investigate a patient with urinary symptoms.

INTRODUCTION
The volume of water in the circulation is under constant
physiological control. Water is normally reabsorbed from
the loop of Henle as it passes through the hyperosmolar renal medulla, and is also reabsorbed from the collecting
ducts under the control of antidiuretic hormone (ADH),
also called arginine vasopressin (AVP) (Fig. 15.1). ADH is
synthesized by the hypothalamus and released from the
posterior pituitary in response to a rise in serum osmolality
or fall in plasma volume. Conversely, a fall in osmolality or
rise in plasma volume leads to a decrease in ADH secretion.
Polyuria is defined as the passage of excessive volumes of urine. Urine output depends on fluid intake
and loss via other routes (e.g., respiration, sweat, faeces), and typically ranges from 1 to 3.5 L/day. Polydipsia is defined as excessive thirst, often manifested as
the ingestion of excessive volumes of fluid, and is usually a consequence of polyuria.
Frequency is the frequent passage of small volumes of
urine, and dysuria is pain on passing urine. Symptoms of
bladder outflow obstruction, such as those caused by an
enlarged prostate gland, include hesitancy (difficulty initiating micturition), terminal dribbling and poor stream.
Nocturia, the passage of urine at night, may be associated
with frequency or polyuria. Urinary incontinence is common and broadly divided into stress or urge incontinence.
Oliguria and anuria, the passage of small volumes or
no urine, respectively, may be due to renal impairment
(see Ch. 33) or urinary tract obstruction.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
URINARY SYMPTOMS
HINTS AND TIPS
There are many causes of polyuria but those seen most
commonly in clinical practice are hyperglycaemia and
hypercalcaemia.
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00015-4

The differential diagnosis of polyuria/polydipsia is summarized in Fig. 15.2.
Frequency is commonly due to bladder irritation,
which is often due to infection but can also be caused
by chemical irritation, tumours or calculi in the bladder.
In men, frequency is often caused by prostatic hypertrophy, when it may be accompanied by poor stream, hesitancy and dribbling. Any of the conditions leading to
frequency may also cause nocturia.
Dysuria is most commonly due to infection, but can
also be caused by chemical irritation. When accompanied by frequency it may indicate cystitis, and in men
may also be caused by prostatitis.
Stress incontinence is common in women and often
due to weakened pelvic floor muscles due to physical
changes following pregnancy and childbirth. Urge incontinence is associated with detrusor instability and inappropriate contraction, which may be a consequence
of local factors such as infection or inflammation, or
due to damage to the nerve supply. Innervation is
mainly from the autonomic nervous system, although
there is voluntary control of the external urinary sphincter, and higher control of urination in the micturition
centre of the pons.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
URINARY SYMPTOMS
For many urinary symptoms there will be a simple explanation, for instance infection or prostatic hypertrophy. The history should focus on the following points:
• Frequency: is there coexistent fever, dysuria or
cloudy urine (pyuria) which may indicate infection?
If so, is there a history of recurrent infection that
might indicate a predisposition (e.g. diabetes, urinary stasis, immunosuppression)? In men, are there
associated symptoms of prostatic hypertrophy, and
if so, are there any associated features of prostate

•

malignancy (e.g. weight loss, bony pain, symptoms
of hypercalcaemia)?
Does the patient have loin pain, or a past history of
renal calculi?
Is there associated haematuria? In the presence of
other lower urinary tract symptoms this could be
due to infection, calculus or bladder tumour.
If incontinence is present, be careful to determine
the circumstances in which it occurs and the effect
it is having on the patient’s everyday activities.
The patient’s current medication may provide clues
as to the cause.

Polyuria and polydipsia may pose a more difficult diagnostic challenge, and after general questions the enquiry
should focus on the following:
• Differentiate between polyuria (an increase in the
volume of urine production) and frequency (the frequent passage of small amounts of urine).
• Weight loss: may be associated with diabetes or malignancy: brain metastases can cause pituitary
dysfunction; bone metastases may cause hypercalcaemia; myeloma may cause hypercalcaemia and renal failure (due to hypercalcaemia or light chain
deposition).
• Headache: primary or secondary brain tumours can
cause diabetes insipidus.
• Family history: this is relevant in diabetes mellitus
and both forms of diabetes insipidus (cranial and
nephrogenic).
• Previous medical history: in particular, consider previous neurosurgery or radiotherapy, head injuries
and meningitis.
• Drug history: analgesic abuse may cause renal papillary necrosis; lithium may cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; vitamin D or milk-alkali syndrome
may lead to hypercalcaemia; nephrotoxic drugs.
• Recurrent infections: may be due to diabetes
mellitus.
• Features of hypercalcaemia (see Ch. 35), hypokalaemia (see Ch. 33), chronic renal failure (see Ch. 33)
and its common causes – hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, polycystic kidneys, urinary tract obstruction, chronic pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis.
• Brief psychiatric history: especially if thirst is predominant. These patients may drink surreptitiously,
resist investigation, have other neurotic symptoms
and lack nocturnal symptoms.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
URINARY SYMPTOMS
The examination approach in the patient with urinary
symptoms is summarized in Fig. 15.3.

15

General appearance
• Wasting/cachexia (malignancy and diabetes mellitus) and hydration status.
• Skin manifestations: diabetes mellitus and malignancy (see Ch. 36).
• Nails: brown arcs in chronic renal failure; clubbing –
associated with bronchogenic carcinoma, which may
produce excess adrenocorticotrophic hormone (and
therefore hypokalaemia and nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus) or parathyroid hormone (and therefore
hypercalcaemia), or may metastasize to brain.
• Anaemia: malignancy or chronic renal failure.
• Lymphadenopathy: malignancy or infiltrative disorder.
• Optic signs: fundal changes of hypertension or diabetes.

Cardiovascular system
Check the heart rhythm (atrial natriuretic peptide production) and the blood pressure for hypertensive
nephropathy.

Abdominal examination
Palpate for the kidneys carefully as they may be enlarged
in polycystic kidney disease or hydronephrosis. A large
bladder may indicate urinary tract obstruction. The liver
and spleen may be enlarged in malignancy and infiltrative disorders. An enlarged or craggy prostate can often
be palpated on rectal examination.

Neurological examination
The neurological examination should assess the
following:
• Peripheral neuropathy (caused by diabetes or infiltrative disorders).
• Hypotonia and areflexia with hypokalaemia.
• Wasting in malignancy.
• Visual fields (classically bitemporal hemianopia
with pituitary pathology) and papilloedema (raised
intracranial pressure).
• In idiopathic urge incontinence, is there evidence of
any underlying neurological abnormality?

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH URINARY SYMPTOMS
The following investigations should be carried out.

Urine tests
• Simple urinalysis will give an estimate of the specific
gravity (a measure of the weight of dissolved particles

in the urine) and will also detect protein, blood, glucose and ketones, as well as leucocytes and nitrites,
the presence of which may indicate infection.
• Laboratory urine analysis can measure urine osmolality, which is usually closely related to specific gravity unless there is a small number of large particles,
e.g. myeloma. It can also measure the sodium and
potassium content.
• Urine microscopy may reveal the presence of blood
cells, bacteria or casts, and culture may reveal a pathogenic organism.

Blood tests
• Biochemistry: renal failure (see Ch. 33), hypercalcaemia (see Ch. 35), hypokalaemia (see Ch. 33) and
hyperglycaemia (see Ch. 35).

94

• Full blood count: anaemia with chronic renal failure
or malignancy (e.g. leukaemia, myeloma). Evidence
of infection.

Imaging
• Chest X-ray: if any suspicion of sarcoidosis, primary
or secondary malignancy.
• Renal tract ultrasound can detect abnormal kidney
size, cysts and masses, congenital defects of the renal
tract, hydronephrosis/hydroureter.
• CT of kidneys/ureters/bladder (CT KUB) if there is
suspicion of renal tract calculi.
• CT or MRI of brain to investigate intracranial
pathology (e.g. if considering a space-occupying
lesion).

Investigating the patient with urinary symptoms

Further tests
• Renal concentration tests in polyuria: if either a hypothalamic or pituitary cause or renal tubular dysfunction is suspected. It is mandatory to exclude
other potential causes for polyuria, as renal concentration tests may be dangerous. The patient is asked
to drink nothing from 16:00 h the day before attending the outpatient department. If the urine osmolal-

15

ity the next morning is not above 800 mmol/kg,
inpatient tests are required (Figs 15.4 and 15.5).
• Urodynamic tests: these commonly measure the preand post-void bladder volume and flow rate to assess
bladder emptying.
• Nuclear renography: radioisotope uptake scans (e.g.
DMSA, DTPA, MAG3 scans) can provide detailed information about asymmetric kidney function and
can evaluate kidney scarring.

Haematuria and proteinuria

16

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Know the definition and causes of haematuria and proteinuria.
• Assess a patient with haematuria or proteinuria.
• Understand the investigations to determine the cause of haematuria and proteinuria.

INTRODUCTION
Haematuria and proteinuria are common presentations
of renal disease, although both may also be due to systemic conditions. They are often incidental findings on
urine dipstick testing, although macroscopic haematuria
is not an uncommon presenting complaint. Microscopically, haematuria is abnormal if there are more than 2 red
blood cells per mm3 of unspun urine; proteinuria is defined as more than 150 mg of protein per 24-h collection
of urine. Remember that red-coloured urine may also be
due to haemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, porphyria,
drugs (e.g. rifampicin) or even the ingestion of beetroot.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
HAEMATURIA AND PROTEINURIA

Haematuria
This is best classified by the site of pathology.

Systemic conditions
•

•
•

Clotting disorders and anticoagulants.
Thrombocytopenia.
Sickle cell disease.
Endocarditis.
Vasculitides.

Kidneys
• Glomerular disease (e.g. immunoglobulin A nephropathy, one of the multiple glomerulonephritides, infective endocarditis).
• Infections (e.g. pyelonephritis, tuberculosis).
• Tumours (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, angioma, adenoma, papilloma).
• Cystic disease (e.g. polycystic kidney disease, medullary sponge kidney).

• Interstitial nephritis: drugs (>75% cases) (e.g. penicillins, sulphonamides and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs).
• Trauma (e.g. both spontaneous and after renal
biopsy).
• Papillary necrosis.

Ureters
• Calculi.

Tumours.
Foreign bodies (e.g. urinary catheters).

Other sites
Haematuria may result from lesions in adjacent organs
(by fistula formation or inflammation) such as:
• Colonic diverticulitis.
• Inflammatory bowel disease.

97

Haematuria and proteinuria
• Acute appendicitis in a pelvic appendix.
• Acute salpingitis and pelvic inflammatory disease.
• Carcinoma of the colon or genital tract.

Fig. 16.2 Causes of nephrotic syndrome.

Cause
Renal disease

Examples
Glomerular disorders:

• primary
• secondary to cause

Proteinuria

Reflux nephropathy

Small amounts of proteinuria can occur in non-renal
disease such as urinary tract infection and with vaginal
mucus; however, significant proteinuria >1 g/day usually indicates primary renal pathology (Fig. 16.1).

Systemic disease

Amyloidosis
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Henoch–Schönlein purpura

Metabolic disease

Diabetes mellitus

Infection

HIV
Infective endocarditis
Malaria
Hepatitis B

Malignancy

Lymphoma
Myeloma

Drugs

Pathological proteinuria

Gold
Penicillamine
Heroin
Heavy metals

Familial disorders

This can result from all glomerular disease as the basement membrane is damaged, resulting in increased permeability across it. Differential diagnoses include:

Alport’s syndrome
Finnish-type nephrotic syndrome
Sickle cell disease

Allergy

Bee stings
Pollen

Benign proteinuria
• Functional proteinuria: pyrexia, strenuous exercise,
congestive cardiac failure, acute illnesses, pregnancy.
• Orthostatic proteinuria: common in males aged under 30 years; proteinuria when upright but normal
when supine.

• Diabetes mellitus.
• Glomerulonephritis.
• Other causes of nephrotic syndrome (Fig. 16.2).
In addition to the above, tubular proteinuria, due to tubular or interstitial damage, may occur. Proteinuria results from failure of the tubules to reabsorb some of the
plasma proteins that have been filtered by the normal
glomerulus. The loss of protein is usually mild and
may result from the following:
• Congenital disorders: Fanconi’s syndrome, cystinosis, renal tubular acidosis.
• Heavy metal poisoning: lead, cadmium, Wilson’s
disease.
• Acute tubular necrosis.
• Chronic nephritis and pyelonephritis.
• Renal transplantation.

Common causes are given in bold.

Overflow proteinuria
This is when abnormal amounts of low-molecularweight protein (filtered at the glomerulus) are neither
reabsorbed nor catabolized completely by the renal tubular cells. There is no underlying renal pathology, simply increased protein filtration. The following may be
responsible:
• Acute pancreatitis: amylase.
• Multiple myeloma: Bence Jones protein.
• Haemolytic anaemia and march haemoglobinuria:
haemoglobin.
• Rhabdomyolysis: myoglobin (e.g. after a crush injury).

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
HAEMATURIA AND PROTEINURIA
HINTS AND TIPS
If haematuria is present in a young woman, it is
important to ask about the menstrual cycle and
whether she was menstruating when the haematuria
was noticed.

Investigating the patient with haematuria and proteinuria
The differential diagnosis is vital when taking a focused
history in a patient presenting with haematuria or
proteinuria.

Presenting complaint
• Ask about the appearance of the urine. Is there frank
blood (malignancy), the frothy urine of heavy proteinuria or foreign matter (e.g. vesicocolic fistula)?
• Ask about the urine volume: oliguria may indicate
renal failure; polyuria could be a sign of systemic disease (e.g. diabetes or interstitial renal disease and
loss of tubular concentrating ability).
• Ask about associated urinary symptoms, such as frequency (urinary tract infection, bladder calculus,
prostatism), hesitancy, strangury (the desire to pass
something that will not pass, e.g. a calculus) and dysuria (painful micturition reflecting urethral or bladder inflammation).
• When does it occur in the urinary stream? Is the haematuria worse with exercise? This suggests tumour or
calculus.
• Ask about loin pain. This suggests pyelonephritis or
renal calculi.
• Ask about colicky pain. This suggests a ureteric
calculus.
• Is there a history of trauma?
• Does the patient have a vaginal or penile discharge?
• Is the proteinuria only present after vigorous exercise?
• Is the proteinuria absent in early morning specimens
(orthostatic proteinuria)?

16

• Are there any risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis?
• Ensure the patient is not pregnant. While usually benign, never forget pre-eclampsia.
• Do not forget to keep the causes of nephrotic syndrome in mind (see Fig. 16.2).
HINTS AND TIPS
Ask whether the patient has noticed the first
appearance of blood when they pass urine. Patients
may not volunteer this information because they do not
think it is important.
• If the urine is bloodstained at the start of micturition,
and clear later on, the site of pathology is likely to
be the urethra or prostate.
• If the urine is more bloodstained towards the end of
micturition, the site of pathology is likely to be the
bladder.
• If the urine is evenly bloodstained throughout
micturition, the site of pathology is likely to be the
kidney or ureter.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
HAEMATURIA AND PROTEINURIA
The examination approach is summarized in Fig. 16.3.

Associated features
• Is there any evidence of systemic or chronic illness
(e.g. arthralgia or rash with vasculitis/connective tissue disease or retinopathy with diabetes mellitus)?
• Ask specifically about diabetes mellitus, hypertension, previous calculi and recurrent urine infections.
• Has there been a history of acute illness, especially
fever (e.g. with urinary tract infection or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis)?
• Are there generalized features of carcinoma (e.g. anorexia and weight loss)?
• Ask about past and current medications (e.g. analgesics (nephropathy) or anticoagulants).
• Is there a history of significant foreign travel (e.g.
schistosomiasis or tuberculosis)?
• Is there a family history? Are there clotting disorders –
does the patient bruise easily? Is there a history of
renal problems (e.g. polycystic kidney disease, sickle
cell disease)?
• Are there symptoms of fluid overload or hypoalbuminaemia (e.g. shortness of breath, orthopnoea, ankle swelling)?
• Ask about heavy metal exposure.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH HAEMATURIA AND
PROTEINURIA
An algorithm for the investigation of the patient with
haematuria and proteinuria is given in Fig. 16.4. Renal
biopsy may provide the best information but is invasive
and not without risk (1% of patients have significant
bleeding, 1 per 500 need blood transfusion and 1 per
2000 need emergency nephrectomy or die from percutaneous renal biopsy). It is therefore customary to start
with urine, blood and radiological tests.

Urine
The following urinary tests should be performed.

Initial tests
• Gross appearance: frank haematuria should always
make the doctor consider malignancy.

• Urinary dipstick: provides initial information about
presence or absence and degree of protein and haematuria. Many sticks also test for nitrites/leucocytes/
ketones/pH and glucose.
• Microscopy: red blood cells (dysmorphic or normal), white blood cells, casts (red cell casts imply
glomerulonephritis), organisms and crystals.
• Culture: infection.
• Early morning urine: acid-fast bacilli if tuberculosis
is suspected.
• Cytology: malignancy.

24-h collection of urine
The precise level of proteinuria is important as an indicator of both the severity and the likely rate of progression of renal disease. It is usually done on a 24-h sample

of urine. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be
assessed from creatinine measurements in blood and
urine. Patients often comply poorly with this test
and the results may be erroneous. Many nephrologists
and laboratories now use an estimated value (e.g. via
the Cockcroft–Gault equation) to monitor the GFR.
This estimated value, or eGFR, can be obtained from
plasma creatinine levels without the need for urine
measurements.

Protein-to-creatinine ratio
This is performed on a single spot urine sample (preferably morning). It correlates well with accurate 24-h urinary protein collection values and is predictive of
decline in GFR in diabetic and non-diabetic proteinuric
renal failure.

Differential protein clearance
Differential protein clearance (selectivity) is occasionally performed in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Patients with selective proteinuria (low-molecular-weight
proteins are cleared more rapidly than large proteins)
are more likely to respond to steroid therapy.

Blood tests
The following blood tests should be performed:
• Full blood count: leucocytosis with infections, anaemia with chronic renal failure.

• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (e.g. vasculitis).
• Clotting studies: bleeding diathesis.
• Blood glucose: diabetes mellitus.
• Urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR: renal function.
• Creatine kinase: myoglobinuria.
• Uric acid: gout.
• Blood cultures: infective endocarditis.
• Specialized investigations according to clinical suspicion (e.g. serum complement, antistreptococcal titres and anti-GBM antibodies).
• Protein electrophoresis and urinary Bence Jones protein (myeloma).
• HIV and hepatitis serology: potential causes of nephrotic syndrome.

Haematuria and proteinuria

Imaging

Other investigations

Imaging is of most use in urological practice where structural lesions are suspected. Renal tract ultrasound scanning is useful in nephrological practice to assess size and
cortical structure of the kidney and visualize the ureters
and bladder to guide further imaging. This may include:

• Cystoscopy: bladder lesions.
• Ureteroscopy: ureter lesions.

• KUB X-ray (kidney/ureter/bladder): renal outline
and stones. 90% of renal calculi are opaque; urate
and xanthine stones may be radiolucent.
• Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan: to visualize the kidneys, adjacent organs and other abdominal masses. CT KUB is now the gold standard
for the diagnosis of renal calculi (99% sensitive).
• Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
superior to CT for some solid lesions and for staging
of renal cell carcinoma. It is also useful for patients
who cannot be administered contrast media because
of significant renal impairment.
• Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning: radionuclide scan that assesses renal function. Particularly useful in diagnosing pyelonephritis.

102

HINTS AND TIPS
When thinking of causes of haematuria, think of the
site of pathology along the renal tract. At each site,
tumours, calculi, infection and inflammation are
possible.

HINTS AND TIPS
Frank haematuria in the elderly needs urological
investigation for malignancy first.

Hypertension

17

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the definition and differential diagnosis of hypertension.
• Have a logical approach to assessing the patient with hypertension, based on blood pressure levels and
overall cardiovascular disease risk.
• Investigate patients presenting with hypertension.

INTRODUCTION
Hypertension is one of the most important modifiable
risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as stroke,
myocardial infarction and renal disease. The blood pressure (BP) above which someone is ‘hypertensive’ and
requires treatment varies between different countries.
However, most clinicians and published British guidelines would initiate drug treatment when the BP is
persistently elevated to 160/100 mmHg (stage 2 hypertension) and consider it when the BP is 140/
90 mmHg (stage 1 hypertension). These are arbitrary
cut-off points that are influenced by age, the presence
of end-organ damage or established cardiovascular disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors for example
diabetes mellitus. Approximately 95% of all hypertensive patients have ‘essential’ or ‘primary’ hypertension
and have no underlying disease. Secondary hypertension can be the result of a range of different pathological
processes: for example, renal artery stenosis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
HYPERTENSION

Essential hypertension
Essential hypertension comprises 95% of cases. There is
no demonstrable cause, although lifestyle may play a
part (e.g. obesity, alcohol, lack of exercise, high salt
diet), and is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Secondary hypertension
Secondary hypertension comprises 5% of cases. Factors
leading to secondary hypertension are:

• Renal parenchymal disease (e.g. chronic pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, polycystic disease,
tumour).
• Renal artery disease (e.g. atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis).
• Obstructive uropathy (e.g. hydronephrosis due to a
stone or tumour).
• Congenital (e.g. coarctation of the aorta).
• Drugs (e.g. combined oral contraceptive pill, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).
• Endocrine (e.g. phaeochromocytoma, hyperaldosteronism, Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism).
• Raised intracranial pressure. Usually coupled with
bradycardia, the ‘Cushing reflex’ (rarely seen as a
cause for hypertension in the outpatient setting).
• Obstructive sleep apnoea.
HINTS AND TIPS
95% of patients with hypertension have no identifiable
underlying cause.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
HYPERTENSION
Hypertension is usually asymptomatic and is often
found by screening. Ideally, all people should have their
blood pressure measured every 5 years as a minimum.
The history in a patient with high BP should be
approached in three parts.
First, how long has the patient had hypertension and
what treatments have been given so far? Second, how
severe is the hypertension and has it resulted in complications? Finally, are there any risk factors suggesting that
an underlying cause may be present?

103

Hypertension

Presentation and history of
hypertension

• Symptoms of phaeochromocytoma are rare but include episodic pallor, headache, tremor, palpitations and nausea.

Important questions to address are as follows:
• How was the hypertension discovered? For example,
at a routine assessment or with malignant (accelerated) hypertension? Liaison with the patient’s general practitioner or other health care professionals
may be needed for a full history.
• For how long has the blood pressure been monitored? Unless the BP is very high or the patient is
at high risk of cardiovascular disease, the diagnosis
should not be made until the blood pressure has
been persistently elevated for at least 3 months.
• What treatments, if any, has the patient been given
so far? If blood pressure control is poor despite taking correct doses of three antihypertensive agents,
the patient is said to have ‘resistant hypertension’.

How severe is the hypertension
and are there complications?
Mild hypertension is asymptomatic. However, when hypertension is severe or chronic, it can be associated with
complications resulting from end-organ damage. The
following symptoms may occur:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Headaches.
Dyspnoea.
Symptoms of cardiac failure.
Angina pectoris or myocardial infarction.
Transient ischaemic attacks or stroke.
Visual disturbance.
Hypertensive emergency: hypertensive encephalopathy. This requires immediate HDU/ITU management with IV labetalol or calcium channel blockers,
ACE inhibitor or even, although rarely, sodium
nitroprusside.

Is the history suggestive of an
underlying cause?
Ask about the following:
• Lifestyle history, paying particular attention to
smoking (atherosclerosis).
• Precise drug history (e.g. oestrogen-containing
contraceptive or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs).
• Previous medical history (e.g. recurrent pyelonephritis, nephrectomy).
• Family history may suggest an underlying disease
(e.g. adult polycystic kidney disease).

104

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
HYPERTENSION
Patients with uncomplicated mild essential hypertension will have no associated clinical signs. However,
when a patient is found to be hypertensive, one should
search for evidence of complications or an underlying
cause (Fig. 17.1).

Evidence of an underlying cause
• Palpable kidneys: polycystic disease, renal tumour.
• Peripheral vascular disease and xanthelasmata: renal
artery stenosis.
• Renal bruits are rarely heard. Other vascular bruits
are equally valid indicators of atherosclerosis: renovascular disease.
• Radiofemoral delay: coarctation of the aorta.
• Neurofibromatosis: renal artery stenosis.
• Cushing’s disease, acromegaly.

Evidence of complications
• Atrial fibrillation.
• Displaced, thrusting apex beat indicating left ventricular hypertrophy.
• Cardiac failure.
• Hypertensive retinopathy.
• Previous stroke.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH HYPERTENSION
An algorithm for the investigation of the patient with
hypertension is given in Fig. 17.2. At presentation all hypertensive patients should have the following tests:
• Urine dipstick for blood and protein: parenchymal
disease, urinary tract infection, stone.
• Urea and electrolytes: may indicate renal impairment or suggest a cause (e.g. Conn’s syndrome).
• Blood glucose and lipid profile: screen for modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.
• Electrocardiogram: significant hypertension may result in left ventricular hypertrophy.

• Global cardiovascular event risk assessment using a
published risk assessment chart.

Fig. 17.3 shows those patients who should then be
investigated further, using the following tests:

The blood pressure should be measured reproducibly
(i.e. with the correct cuff size, the patient seated, relaxed
and the cuff at the level of the heart). Diastolic pressure
is recorded when the audible pulse disappears (Korotkoff V). If an automated monitor is being used, it should
be one that is validated for the purpose by organizations
such as the British Hypertension Society, or the American Heart Association.

• 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement (e.g.
when blood pressure is abnormally variable, resistant to drug treatment or to exclude ‘white coat
hypertension’).
• 24-h urinary catecholamine and metanephrine excretion: phaeochromocytoma.
• Radiological investigations: renovascular disease, renal parenchymal disease, obstructive uropathy. This

Headache and facial pain

18

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The causes of headache and facial pain.
• The systematic approach to assessing a patient presenting with headache or facial pain.
• The sequence of investigations to determine the cause of the headache or facial pain.

INTRODUCTION
Headache is one of the most common presenting symptoms. There are often few clinical signs and the history is
the main diagnostic tool. Many different pathological
processes can result in headache and facial pain. The International Headache Society classification divides
headache into primary headache (where the headache
is itself the disease), secondary headache (where the
headache is due to other disease, e.g. infection) and a
third subset which includes facial pain and cranial neuralgias. The more common headaches of all three subsets are considered together here according to the
pattern of headache; this list is not exhaustive.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF HEADACHE AND FACIAL PAIN
The differential diagnosis of headache and facial pain is
summarized in Fig. 18.1.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT
WITH HEADACHE AND
FACIAL PAIN
This is the key to diagnosis and the onset, nature and subsequent pattern of pain will usually provide a good shortlist of likely causes. The presence of additional symptoms
and risk factors may add further weight to this list.

Solitary acute episode
This pattern is seen in vascular events, infection and
trauma. (Note that it may also be the first presentation
of the other causes of headache.)
Subarachnoid haemorrhage presents with a sudden
onset of severe pain ‘as if someone had hit them on

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00018-X

the head’. It is often most severe occipitally, and usually
reaches maximal severity at onset or within seconds.
Nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness and photophobia result from meningeal irritation, but they are not discriminating features. Altered conscious level, seizures and
focal neurological deficits may also occur depending
on the site and size of the haemorrhage.
Seizures, focal neurological symptoms and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (see below) can also
result from cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Causal
factors include inherited disorders of coagulation, pregnancy, oral contraceptive pill use, dehydration, extension of local infection (e.g. of paranasal sinuses or
middle ear) and severe intercurrent illness. Dissection
of a carotid or vertebral artery can also cause a sudden
onset of pain associated with focal neurology.
Patients with infective meningitis present with a
short history of headache, symptoms of infection (malaise, fever and rigors), symptoms of meningeal irritation
(vomiting, photophobia, neck pain and stiffness) and
may have a rash and altered mental state. However, tuberculous and carcinomatous meningitis, as well as
other causes of ‘aseptic’ meningitis, have a more subacute presentation that can be easily missed. Encephalitis, acute inflammation of the brain, may present with
headache and fever. Altered mental state is common
and occurs early in the course of the illness.
Cerebral abscess causes headaches, seizures, symptoms of infection and of raised intracranial pressure
as the lesion enlarges. The infection may have spread
from a local or distant primary focus, such as lung infection (bronchiectasis, abscess), endocarditis, middle ear
infection or paranasal sinusitis.
Acute angle-closure glaucoma can cause a severe
headache associated with blurred vision, eye pain,
cloudiness of the cornea, conjunctival injection and a
dilated pupil. There may be nausea and vomiting. It
should be considered in hypermetropic, middle-aged
or elderly patients. It may occur intermittently with repeated acute attacks.

Myocardial ischaemia (rarely)

Progressive headache
A headache that comes on gradually over days or
weeks and increases in severity is often a feature of a
‘space-occupying lesion’ (such as tumour or abscess), idiopathic intracranial hypertension (previously ‘benign’
intracranial hypertension), chronic subdural haematoma
or hydrocephalus (which may be due to blockage of CSF
flow secondary to other pathology). In all of these the
headache results from raised intracranial pressure and
has the characteristic features shown in Fig. 18.2. Temporal arteritis also presents gradually, but the nature of
the headache is very different.
Cerebral tumours can be primary or secondary, and
the patient may have a history of malignancy elsewhere.
The most common tumours to metastasize to the brain
are those of the bronchus, breast, and melanoma, as
well as thyroid, gastrointestinal and renal tumours. In
addition to headache, the patient may also develop seizures and focal neurological deficits related to the site of
the lesion.

110

Fig. 18.2 Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure.

Headache worse on coughing, sneezing, stooping down
Headache worse in the morning
Visual disturbance due to papilloedema
Nausea and vomiting
Diplopia (false localizing 6th cranial nerve palsy)

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is most common in young women. Headache, nausea and visual
disturbance are the presenting symptoms. There is an association with obesity, certain drugs and empty sella
syndrome. If left untreated, the patient may become
blind as a result of infarction of the optic nerve, hence
why the condition is no longer termed ‘benign’.
Chronic subdural haematoma may follow seemingly
minor trauma several weeks previously, and the headache may be associated with cognitive impairment.
Hydrocephalus can be due to either blockage of CSF
flow (‘non-communicating’, e.g. haemorrhage, cysts,
malformations) or failure of CSF reabsorption (‘communicating’, e.g. following meningitis or subarachnoid
haemorrhage).
Temporal arteritis predominantly affects older people, and mean age at onset is over 70 years old. The patient presents with a superficial headache overlying the
temporal arteries; there is often scalp tenderness which
may be exacerbated by brushing or combing the hair.
Jaw claudication, and occasionally tongue claudication,
may arise as a consequence of inflammation of the
branches of the external carotid artery. Visual loss
may be temporary (amaurosis fugax) or permanent if
the ciliary or central retinal arteries are affected. Weight
loss, anorexia, fever and proximal muscle stiffness (but
not tenderness) may also occur.
HINTS AND TIPS
Consider temporal arteritis in any patient over 50 years
old with a headache.

Recurrent episodic headache
and facial pain
Migraine and cluster headaches present with episodes of
pain (often severe) interspersed with long symptomfree periods. Paroxysms of pain are also a feature of trigeminal neuralgia and other cranial neuralgias.
Although, classically, migraine is preceded by aura,
migraine without aura is more common. Premonitory
symptoms precede both types, occur hours to days
before the migraine, and include fatigue, nausea and
sensitivity to light and noise. Aura, if present, directly
precedes the headache, lasts 5–60 min, and most

Examining the patient with headache and facial pain
commonly consists of visual features (positive, e.g. flickering lights, spots or lines, or negative, e.g. visual loss),
sensory symptoms (paraesthesiae or numbness) or
dysphasia. Occasionally, aura may include focal neurological signs including motor weakness; the features
must be fully reversible to be defined as aura. The
migraine headache is typically unilateral (though may
become generalized), pulsating and associated with
nausea, photophobia, phonophobia and an aversion
to physical activity. The attack resolves spontaneously
after 4–72 h and is often followed by sleep. Sometimes
the aura can occur without the subsequent headache.
Migraine is more common in women. Provoking factors include menstruation, fatigue, cheese, red wine and
the oral contraceptive pill.
Cluster headache is a severe unilateral pain centred
around one eye. The pain lasts for 15–180 min if
untreated and occurs daily (up to 8 times per day) for
several weeks, often waking the patient from sleep.
There may be ipsilateral nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea, and the eye can become watery and red; miosis
and ptosis can also develop, and occasionally will
become permanent. Symptom-free periods of many
months occur between attacks. It is more common in
men and may be precipitated by alcohol. Cluster headache is the commonest of a group of headaches called
the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, which share
headache and parasympathetic activation as their cardinal features.
Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysms
of lancinating pain in the distribution of the 5th cranial
nerve. It is often stimulated by touching ‘trigger zones’
on the face such as the lips, or by eating or drinking,
but can occur spontaneously. The pain lasts for up to
2 min and does not occur during sleep. Spontaneous remissions can last several months.

Chronic headache and facial pain
Persistent pain is a feature of postherpetic neuralgia,
post-traumatic headache, Paget’s disease of the skull
and tension headache.
Following shingles of the trigeminal nerve (usually
the ophthalmic division), a persistent burning pain
known as postherpetic neuralgia may develop. Facial
scarring is usually apparent and the pain may disturb
sleep. It is uncommon in the young.
Tension-type headache is the commonest cause of
headache presenting to doctors. The feeling is often described as ‘a tight band around the head’, is most often
constant and bilateral, and tends to be worse towards
the end of the day or at times of particular stress.
Following head injury, which may not necessarily be
severe, a few patients develop persistent headache, similar to a tension headache. It is associated with poor

18

memory and concentration, dizziness, irritability and
symptoms of depression.
With any frequent or chronic headache, medicationoveruse headache may be superimposed; it can occur
with practically any of the medications commonly used
for headache. Criteria for diagnosis are outlined by the
International Headache Society classification.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT
WITH HEADACHE AND
FACIAL PAIN
The diagnosis is often clear from the history. On examination look for evidence of the pathological processes,
such as raised intracranial pressure and meningism. Focal neurological deficits, if present, help to determine
the site of the lesion. Fig. 18.3 summarizes the examination approach.

Signs of raised intracranial
pressure
• Papilloedema: commonly, the only sign.
• False localizing sign (ipsilateral then bilateral 6th
cranial nerve palsy).
• Altered level of consciousness, bradycardia with hypertension (the Cushing reflex – a late sign), which
can progress to decerebrate posturing and death.

Signs of meningism
• Irritability: with a preference for a quiet, darkened
room.
• Neck stiffness and photophobia.
• Positive Kernig’s sign: spasm and pain in hamstrings
on knee extension.
• Positive Brudzinski’s sign: neck flexion causes hip
and knee flexion.
• Delirium, fever and petechial rash: may be present
in infectious meningitis.
If subarachnoid haemorrhage is suspected, look for subhyaloid (retinal) haemorrhage, bruit of an arteriovenous malformation and a 3rd cranial nerve palsy
caused by direct pressure from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Signs of temporal arteritis
• Temporal artery tenderness.
• Loss of temporal artery pulsation – there may be
overlying erythema.
• Optic atrophy (seen as optic disc pallor).
• Low-grade pyrexia.

Blood tests

Focal neurological signs will help to determine the site
of the lesion (see Chs 24 and 26) and may be found in
addition to other signs, such as meningism or raised intracranial pressure.

• Full blood count: normochromic normocytic anaemia suggests chronic pathology (e.g. temporal arteritis, tuberculous meningitis); leucocytosis will be
seen in infection.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: high in temporal arteritis but may also be raised in infection and
malignancy.
• Clotting studies may be important in the context of
intracerebral bleeding.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH HEADACHE AND FACIAL
PAIN
An algorithm for the investigation of the patient with
headache and facial pain is given in Fig. 18.4. Investigations include the following.

112

Imaging
• CT or MRI scans of the head: presence of blood, spaceoccupying lesion (tumour, abscess) or hydrocephalus.

Headache and facial pain
Contrast enhancement may help determine the nature
of a lesion.

Further tests
• Temporal artery biopsy: temporal arteritis. This is a
definitive test but, as there is often patchy vascular
involvement (‘skip lesions’), a negative result does
not exclude the diagnosis.
• Lumbar puncture: this should never be performed
when raised intracranial pressure is a possibility, as
it may cause cerebellar tonsil herniation (‘coning’).
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is invaluable
in the diagnosis of meningitis. CSF should be sent to
the laboratory for assessment of glucose and protein,
microscopy, culture and cytology (see Ch. 26). CSF
sampling and spectrophotometry may also diagnose
a small number of subarachnoid haemorrhages not
detected on CT.

114

• CT angiography, MR angiography or digital subtraction angiography (DSA): to identify the precise cause
(e.g. berry aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation) in subarachnoid haemorrhage.
• Visual fields: these should be serially measured in
patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension,
which carries a serious risk of optic nerve infarction.
• Electroencephalography: herpes simplex encephalitis shows characteristic features.
• Intraocular tonometry: pressure will be raised in
glaucoma.

HINTS AND TIPS
When meningitis is suspected clinically, treat with
antibiotics (after blood cultures if in hospital) and then
complete investigations. Patients can die awaiting
confirmation of the diagnosis.

Joint disease

19

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand the differential diagnosis of joint disease.
• Have a logical approach to assessing the patient with painful joints.
• Direct investigations to establish the cause of the joint disease.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
JOINT DISEASE
Possible causes of joint disease are many, although in
practice the common conditions include the following:
•
•
•
•

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Osteoarthritis (OA).
Gout.
Seronegative arthritides: ankylosing spondylitis,
Reiter’s syndrome and psoriatic arthritis.
• Septic arthritis.
• Trauma.

HINTS AND TIPS
The causes of a single hot, red joint is a favourite
question. They are as follows:
• Septic arthritis – until proven otherwise.
• Trauma.
• Gout.
• Pseudogout.
• Haemarthrosis.
• Rheumatoid arthritis.

Arthritis and arthralgia may also be a feature of systemic
disease, including connective tissue diseases, especially
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Less common causes include the following:
• Enteropathic arthropathies (e.g. inflammatory bowel
disease).
• Behçet’s syndrome.
• Leukaemia and lymphoma.
• Metastases: bronchial, breast, thyroid, kidney and
prostate carcinomas.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00019-1

• Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy: bronchial carcinoma.
• Endocrine causes: acromegaly, myxoedema and
hyperparathyroidism.
• Metabolic diseases: Wilson’s disease, haemochromatosis, chondrocalcinosis, ochronosis, pyrophosphate arthropathy.
• Others: familial Mediterranean fever, sarcoidosis,
amyloidosis, sickle cell disease, Wegener’s granulomatosis.
A systematic approach to the differential diagnosis of
joint disease is illustrated in Fig. 19.1.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
JOINT DISEASE
The different types of joint disease have many features
in common, and examination will provide further additional important clues to the aetiology. Ask about the
following.

Presenting complaint
• Onset: rapid or slowly progressive.
• Persistent or relapsing.
• Early morning stiffness and effect of rest and exercise: classically inflammatory arthritis (e.g. RA is
worse first thing in the morning and relieved by exercise). Degenerative arthritis (e.g. OA is worse at the
end of the day and relieved by rest, although there is
considerable overlap).
• Pain: the site, character and exacerbating and relieving factors should be elucidated. Arthralgia is joint
pain, whereas arthritis indicates an inflammatory
process (i.e. swelling, heat and erythema).
• Weakness: with or without wasting of muscles.

• Swelling and deformity.
• In patients with chronic arthritis, it is important to
explore the extent of loss of function. How limited
are the activities of daily living? This often correlates
poorly with the disease activity.
• Distribution of the affected joints (see below): symmetrical or asymmetrical, mono- or polyarthritis.
• Patient’s age: RA classically affects women aged 25–55
years, and OA usually occurs in the over 40s age group.
• Any history of trauma.

Causes of joint pain can be remembered by the
mnemonic SOFTER TISSUE: Sepsis, Osteoarthritis,
Fractures, Tendon/muscle, Epiphyseal, Referred,
Tumour, Ischaemia, Seropositive arthritides,
Seronegative arthritides, Urate, Extra-articular
rheumatism (e.g. polymyalgia).

Associated features

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
JOINT DISEASE

• Recent infection (e.g. viral illness and reactive arthritis or septic arthritis).
• Drug therapy: gout may be precipitated by thiazides
and loop diuretics, allopurinol, pyrazinamide.
• Systemic features associated with different arthropathies: inflammation of the eye (RA and seronegative
arthropathies), shortness of breath (fibrosis in RA
and ankylosing spondylitis), paraesthesiae (entrapment neuropathies), gastrointestinal symptoms
(enteropathic arthropathies).
HINTS AND TIPS
Chronic arthritis and the associated reduction in
function can lead to feelings of helplessness and
depression. Assessment of these features is an
important part of the history in patients with arthritis.

116

HINTS AND TIPS

Rheumatoid arthritis
RA is a systemic connective tissue disorder, the joints being one of many body parts affected. Look for the following (see Fig. 36.1):
• Symmetrical deforming arthropathy.
• Swelling of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints.
• Wasting of the small muscles of the hand.
• Nodules on the elbows and extensor tendons.
• Ulnar deviation of the fingers: subluxation and dislocation at the MCP joints.
• Swan-neck deformity: hyperextension of the PIP
joints and flexion of the MCP and terminal interphalangeal (TIP) joints.
• Boutonnière deformity: flexion of the PIP joints and
extension of the TIP and MCP joints.

Examining the patient with joint disease

19

• ‘Z-shaped’ thumb.
• Trigger finger.
• Iatrogenic Cushing’s disease: steroids used in
treatment.
• Involvement of other joints.
• Cervical spine disease: subluxation very important.
• Anaemia.
• Arteritic lesions: nail-fold infarcts, chronic leg ulceration and purpuric rash.

• Positive Trendelenburg’s sign: this is a downward
tilting of the pelvis on the opposite side to the stance
leg when the patient stands on the affected leg – a
sign of weak hip abduction.
• Joint effusions.
• Intermittent locking of the joints due to loose
bodies.
• Loss of function.

You must also carry out a general examination. In particular, look for the following:

Gout

• Eye signs: keratoconjunctivitis sicca, keratitis, episcleritis, scleromalacia perforans, cataracts due to steroids.
• Dry mucous membranes: Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Chest signs: pleural effusion, fibrosing alveolitis.
• Neurological signs: peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, entrapment neuropathy.
• Vasculitic leg ulceration.
• Felty’s syndrome: splenomegaly, neutropenia.
• Cardiac signs: pericarditis, myocarditis, conduction
defects and valvular incompetence.
• Secondary amyloidosis.
• Other autoimmune disorders.

HINTS AND TIPS
Five causes of anaemia in rheumatoid arthritis:
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia of chronic disease.
• Microcytic anaemia from chronic blood loss
secondary to drug treatment.
• Bone marrow suppression from treatment (e.g. gold
or penicillamine).
• Megaloblastic anaemia from impaired folate release
or pernicious anaemia.
• Felty’s syndrome.

HINTS AND TIPS
Be aware that when introducing yourself to the patient
with rheumatoid arthritis shaking hands may be painful.

Osteoarthritis
In the hands in OA look for the following:
• Heberden’s nodes: swelling of the TIP joints.
• Bouchard’s nodes: swelling of the PIP joints.
• Subluxation of the first metacarpal: square hand
appearance.
• Crepitus of affected joints.
• Wasting and weakness of the muscle groups involved around the joint.

Acute gout presents with severe pain, swelling and erythema of the affected joint. Traditionally this is the first
metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra when the great toe
is affected).
Chronic tophaceous gout follows from recurrent attacks. Look for the following:
• Asymmetrical swelling of the small joints of the
hands and feet.
• Tophi: look especially on the helix of the ear and tendon sheaths.
• Causes of secondary hyperuricaemia (e.g. diuretic
use or tumour lysis syndrome).

Seronegative arthritides
Psoriatic arthritis
Look for the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Asymmetrical arthropathy.
Usually involvement of the TIP joints.
Pitting of the fingernails and onycholysis.
Thickened nails.
Psoriatic plaques: look particularly at the elbows, extensor aspects of limbs, scalp, behind the ears, and
the navel.
• Other forms of psoriatic arthropathy: arthritis mutilans, an RA-like picture, asymmetrical mono- or oligoarthropathy, ankylosing spondylitis.

Ankylosing spondylitis
Ask the patient to sit or stand up. Look for the following:
• Loss of lumbar lordosis and a fixed kyphosis and hyperextension of the neck.
• A stooped, ‘question mark’ posture.
• Rigid spine.
• Reduced chest expansion.
• Prominent abdomen.
Also examine for complications and extra-articular
manifestations:
• Eyes: iritis.
• Cardiovascular system: aortitis (listen for aortic regurgitation and conduction defects).
• Chest: apical fibrosis.

117

Joint disease
• Neurological: atlantoaxial dislocation leading to
paraplegia or sciatica.
• Secondary amyloidosis: feel for organomegaly (pretty
uncommon!)

Reactive arthritis
This is a triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis and seronegative arthritides. It follows non-specific urethritis or occasionally dysentery. Look for the following:
• Large joint mono- or oligoarthritis.
• Iritis.
• Keratoderma blennorrhagica (hyperkeratotic brown,
aseptic abscesses on the soles and palms).
• Mouth ulcers.
• Circinate balanitis.
• Enthesopathy (plantar fasciitis or Achilles tendinitis).
• Aortic regurgitation.

Septic arthritis
This must be recognized and treated promptly because
of potential destruction of the joint and widespread infection. It usually presents as a monoarthritis but can involve multiple joints. The affected joint is swollen,
painful, hot and red. The patient will keep the joint still
and even minimal passive movement will cause significant pain.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH JOINT DISEASE

• Antinuclear antibodies: positive in 30% of patients
with RA and in 80% of patients with SLE.
• Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies: high titres
in SLE.
• Other autoantibodies according to clinical suspicion (e.g. anti-RoSSA and anti-LaSSB antibodies in
Sjögren’s syndrome, and anti-Scl70 antibodies in
scleroderma).
• Viral serology: if a viral cause for the arthropathy is
suspected (e.g. rubella, mumps, infectious mononucleosis, Coxsackie virus and hepatitis B virus).
• Urea and electrolytes: associated renal involvement.
• Liver function tests: liver involvement or drug
treatment.
• Creatine kinase: myositis.
• Serum urate: usually high in gout but beware of false
positives and false negatives.

Joint aspiration
• Note that this should be done prior to starting antibiotics if septic arthritis is suspected, but if there is no
expertise available antibiotics should be started.
• Appearance: purulence indicates infection, frank
blood indicates haemarthrosis or traumatic tap.
• Microscopy and culture for bacteria, polarized light
microscopy for crystals: monosodium urate indicates gout, calcium pyrophosphate indicates pseudogout.
• White cell count: high in inflammatory arthropathies.
• Culture: gonococci, tubercle bacillus or fungi when
indicated.
HINTS AND TIPS

History and examination of the patient presenting with
joint disease will often guide appropriate investigations. Below is a list of investigations that can aid in
diagnosis.

Blood tests
• Full blood count: anaemia; raised white cell count in
infection and occasionally in RA, leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia in SLE, neutropenia in Felty’s
syndrome.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein: non-specific but raised in the presence of inflammation (therefore often high in RA but less so
in OA).
• Rheumatoid factor: positive in about 75% of
patients with RA. It may also be positive in SLE,
mixed connective tissue diseases, scleroderma and
Sjögren’s syndrome.

118

In pseudogout, crystals are positively birefringent
in plane-polarized light. Remember this by the ‘P’s.
In gout, the crystals are negatively birefringent.

Imaging
• Plain X-ray for RA: soft tissue thickening, juxtaarticular osteoporosis, loss of joint space, bony erosions, subluxation.
• Plain X-ray for OA: loss of joint space, subchondral
sclerosis and cysts, marginal osteophytes.
• Plain X-ray for gout: soft tissue swelling and
punched-out lesions in juxta-articular bone.
• Plain X-ray for ankylosing spondylitis: ‘bamboo
spine’ (squaring of the vertebrae and obliteration
of sacroiliac joints); also found in reactive arthritis
and inflammatory bowel disease.

Investigating the patient with joint disease
• A chest X-ray should be performed to look for associated diseases or complications of RA:
• pleural effusion
• diffuse pulmonary fibrosis
• rheumatoid nodules or cavities
• obliterative bronchiolitis
• rheumatoid pneumoconiosis: Caplan’s syndrome.
• Magnetic resonance imaging is now widely used to
provide images of soft tissue injury including ligaments, muscle and intervertebral discs.
• Computed tomography is very good for assessing
bones and joints. Reconstruction of the images using
improved software gives three-dimensional pictures
of the anatomy of an injury.

19

Further investigations
• Arthroscopy allows direct visualization inside the
joint space, and can be used for biopsy and the removal of foreign bodies.

HINTS AND TIPS
Ask the patient how the joint disease affects their daily
activities. Your concerns are not always the same as
those of your patient, but the eventual management
plan should be patient-centred.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The differential diagnosis of back pain.
• How to differentiate non-specific back pain from other causes.
• How to assess a patient with back pain.
• A logical approach to the investigation of back pain.

INTRODUCTION
Back pain is a common problem, affecting up to two-thirds
of adults at some point, and as such is a common presenting complaint placing a considerable burden on health
services. The majority of cases are benign, non-specific
and will resolve within a few weeks; up to 85% of patients
will not receive a precise diagnosis. However, there are
many significant causes and detecting those that need further investigation and treatment is an important skill.
Patients with back pain frequently develop chronic
pain, and the effective management of this problem is
often a challenge.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
BACK PAIN
Back pain is usually due to a mechanical or structural
cause; this may have a neuropathic element to it such
as in the case of spinal stenosis or nerve root pain secondary to a prolapsed disc. The pathology may be
due to an underlying predisposition, e.g. crush fracture
secondary to osteoporosis.
Non-mechanical back pain is less common but important to detect, and includes pain due to inflammatory conditions, infection and cancer.
Back pain may also be referred from other viscera.
The causes of back pain are summarized in Fig. 20.1.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
BACK PAIN

Presenting complaint
Characteristics of the pain
• Site (e.g. level of spine, central or paraspinal) and
radiation.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00020-8

• Character (e.g. shooting in nerve root pain) and
severity (is it affecting their daily activity?)
• Time course including speed of onset, progression,
variation over the day (e.g. worse in the morning
with inflammatory arthritis). Is the pain present at
night?
• Aggravating and relieving features (e.g. pain due to
disc prolapse may be worsened on leaning forward;
pain due to neoplasia is often unremitting).

Associated features
• Weakness and sensory loss: can this be localized to a
single myotome/dermatome (e.g. disc prolapse) or
is it more generalized (e.g. cauda equina syndrome)?
• Incontinence (cauda equina syndrome).
• Stiffness (inflammatory disease).
• Fever (infection, lymphoma).
• Weight loss (inflammatory disease, neoplasia,
chronic infection).
• Involvement of other joints (inflammatory arthritis).
• Pseudoclaudication: leg pain on walking, similar to
ischaemic claudication (spinal stenosis).
• Features of anaemia (e.g. myeloma, colorectal cancer), change in bowel habit (colorectal cancer), new
cough (lung cancer) or urinary symptoms (prostate
cancer).
• Clues suggesting referred pain.
• Depression, anxiety, psychosocial factors (see
Fig. 20.2 – yellow flags).

Other important points
• Age (see Fig. 20.3 – red flags).
• Trauma: may be seemingly innocuous.
• Past medical history: immune compromise, chronic
infection, cancer.
• Response to previous or current medication. Immunosuppressive therapy.
• Family history: inflammatory arthritis.

Investigating the patient with back pain
• Social history: smoking (lung cancer), alcohol
(trauma, osteoporosis), occupation (sprain/strain),
sport (trauma).
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that with inflammatory causes the pain is
worse first thing in the morning, associated with
stiffness, and improves after 30–60 min as the patient
moves around. Conversely, mechanical back pain is
often worse with movement and better at rest.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
BACK PAIN
Examination should start with the affected area of the
spine and subsequently be directed by the history. If concerning features are present, a detailed systemic examination should be performed to look for an underlying
disease process causing the back pain, and for any neurological sequelae.

Spinal examination
• Look: obvious abnormalities are postural abnormality, kyphosis, scoliosis, trauma, masses.
• Feel: assess spine and paraspinal region for tenderness, inflammation. Evaluate any masses fully.
• Move: is there a reduced range of movement or pain
on movement?
• Special tests: straight leg raise.

Other systems/evidence of
underlying disease
• Other joints: inflammatory arthritis.
• Neurological exam: if there is any hint of neurological involvement this needs to be detailed, assessing
motor and sensory function fully.
• Rectal exam: assess anal tone (cauda equina syndrome) and palpate the prostate for masses.
• Respiratory: fibrosis (ankylosing spondylitis), cancer.

20

• Eyes: uveitis (inflammatory arthritis).
• Abdomen: masses (cancer, aortic aneurysm), tenderness (referred pain).

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH BACK PAIN
Investigations should be requested according to clinical
suspicion, and only if there are features of the history or
examination suggesting a significant underlying cause,
or if the pain does not resolve within a few weeks.
Over-investigation should be avoided; most patients
do not require investigation for back pain.

Blood tests
• Full blood count: anaemia in malignancy, chronic
disease. Raised white cell count in infection.
• CRP/ESR: non-specific markers of inflammation
but may be useful in detecting inflammatory arthritis. Will also often be raised in infection and malignancy.
• Renal function, liver function, calcium, parathyroid
hormone, vitamin D, myeloma screen: may be useful depending on suspected underlying pathology.

Imaging
• Plain X-rays of spine and pelvis: these are useful
for detecting fractures (traumatic and compression
fractures), disc space narrowing, degenerative change,
spondylolisthesis, and changes of inflammatory disease (e.g. sacroiliitis, squaring of the vertebrae).
• Cross-sectional imaging: MRI or CT is occasionally
required urgently if there is a suspicion of spinal cord
compression or cauda equina syndrome. In other
circumstances they provide detailed information
on spinal pathology. MRI is preferred for soft tissue
lesions (metastases, abscesses, herniated discs) and
can provide useful information regarding infectious
processes (discitis, osteomyelitis). CT provides better
images of bone and is useful when further delineation of fractures is required, for spondylolisthesis,
and when MRI is contraindicated.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The differential diagnosis and description of lesions affecting the skin.
• How to assess a patient presenting with skin disease.
• The investigations needed to identify the cause of the skin disease.

Dermatology is potentially a large subject for the student and junior doctor. Skin disease may be primary
or the manifestation of a systemic condition. Students
should become familiar with the descriptive terminology used and learn how to manage the most common
conditions. For exams a picture book is essential for revision. Many conditions are covered further in Ch. 36.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS BY
APPEARANCE

Pigmented lesions
• Freckles (ephelides): flat, brown spots arising on
sun-exposed areas.
• Lentigo: similar to freckles but often larger, and not
affected by sunlight, although they may develop due
to sun exposure.
• Seborrhoeic keratosis: benign, beige/brown plaques,
3–20 mm in diameter, with a velvety or warty surface.
• Melanocytic naevus (mole): there are many subtypes,
including the blue naevus (small, slightly elevated
blue-black lesions) and dysplastic naevus (usually a
larger naevus, >5 mm, with an irregular, blurred border and mixed pigmentation and texture).
• Melanoma: flat or raised pigmented lesion with possibly a recent change in appearance. It has varying
colours and typically irregular borders.
• Melasma: well-demarcated patches of increased pigmentation with an irregular border, usually on the
face and predominantly in women.

Scaly lesions
• Psoriasis: silvery, scaled, well-demarcated plaques
on skin, usually over the extensor surfaces. It can also
be pustular or guttate (widespread small lesions)
and involve the nails.
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00021-X

• Atopic dermatitis/eczema: dry, pruritic skin on the
face, neck, wrists and hands, and in the flexures of
the elbows and knees, common in children but possible at any age. Over time the excoriated areas may
become lichenified.
• Seborrhoeic dermatitis: greasy plaques with yellowish scale affecting the face, scalp, armpits, groin and
trunk.
• Xerosis: dry skin.
• Lichen simplex chronicus: chronic rubbing or
scratching in response to itch, causing pigmented,
lichenified skin lesions with exaggerated markings.
• Tinea corporis: fungal infection causing ring-shaped
lesions with a scaly border and central healing, or
scaly inflamed patches with a distinct border.
• Pityriasis versicolor (also tinea versicolor): scaly, discoloured macules or patches, which may be slightly
elevated. They may be pale or hyperpigmented and
are usually on the chest or back.
• Secondary syphilis: pigmented papules with slight
scale.
• Pityriasis rosea: oval, pink/red, scaly lesions following the skin tension lines of the trunk. It is commonly preceded by a herald patch.
• Discoid lupus erythematosus: well-defined red
patches, usually on the face. There is scaling, follicular plugging, atrophy and telangiectasia of involved areas. The patches may thicken and often
leave scars.
• Exfoliative dermatitis: widespread skin erythema
(erythroderma) with scaling or peeling.
• Actinic (solar) keratoses: small, pink lesions that are
rough, crusted and scaly in texture. They are due to
sun damage and are considered to be premalignant.
• Bowen’s disease (intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma): small, well-demarcated, slightly raised,
pink-to-red, scaly plaques.
• Extramammary Paget’s disease: a rare form of adenocarcinoma, this resembles chronic eczema and may
involve apocrine areas such as the genitals.

125

Skin lesions and rash
• Intertrigo: rash in body/skin folds due to excess
moisture and often infection, causing fissuring, erythema and superficial denudation.
HINTS AND TIPS
Dermatitis and eczema are interchangeable terms
(though ’eczema’ is commonly used to refer to the
atopic form). There are several types, and different
types may exist simultaneously.

Vesicular lesions
• Herpes simplex: recurrent, small, grouped vesicles
on an erythematous base, especially around the oral
and genital areas.
• Herpes zoster (‘shingles’): vesicular lesions in a dermatomal distribution, usually preceded by pain and
general malaise.
• Pompholyx (dyshidrotic eczema): small, intensely
pruritic vesicles or bullae on the palms, soles and
sides of fingers.
• Dermatophytid reaction: an allergic reaction to fungal infection causing pruritic, grouped, vesicular lesions in a variable distribution, distant to the site
of primary infection.
• Dermatitis herpetiformis: pruritic papulovesicular
lesions mainly on the elbows, knees, buttocks,
shoulders and scalp. It is associated with glutensensitive enteropathy.
• Miliaria (heat rash): superficial, aggregated, small
vesicles, papules or pustules on covered areas of
the skin.
• Scabies: pruritic vesicles and pustules especially between the fingers.

Weepy or encrusted lesions
• Impetigo: vesiculopustular lesions with thick,
golden-crusted exudate, associated with group A
streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus. Bullous impetigo, with clear blisters, is associated with S. aureus.
• Acute allergic contact dermatitis: erythema and oedema, with pruritus, often followed by vesicles and
bullae in an area of contact with a suspected agent.
They may later weep, crust and become infected.
• Atopic, nummular or vesicular dermatitis may ooze
and become crusted.

Pustular lesions
• Acne vulgaris: the most common skin condition,
characterized by open and closed comedones and
frequently accompanied by cysts, papules and

126

pustules. It varies from mild, purely comedonal to
pustular inflammatory acne. Scarring is common.
• Acne rosacea: papules, pustules and erythema over
the forehead, cheeks and nose, with telangiectasia
and a tendency to flush easily. Hyperplasia of the
soft tissue of the nose (rhinophyma) may occur.
• Folliculitis: pustules in the hair follicles.

Figurate erythema
These are lesions that look like rings or arcs.
• Urticaria: eruptions of evanescent (short-lasting)
wheals or hives.
• Erythema multiforme: erythematous lesions in a
symmetrical distribution initially over the extensor
surfaces of the limbs, spreading to the trunk. Palms,
soles and mucous membranes may be involved.
Lesions start as macules which evolve to become
papular, urticarial, bullous or purpuric. Target lesions with clear centres and concentric erythematous
rings may develop.
• Erythema migrans: an enlarging red patch or ring
around an initial papule. The centre may clear or become indurated, vesicular or necrotic. It is a feature
of Lyme disease.
• Erysipeloid: discrete red/purple lesions, most often
on a finger or the back of the hand, which gradually
enlarge. Caused by Erysipelothrix insidiosa, it is often
seen in fishermen and meat handlers.

Bullous lesions
• Bullous impetigo (see Weepy or encrusted lesions).
• Pemphigus: relapsing crops of flaccid bullae appearing on normal skin, which rupture easily leaving
erosions and ulcerations. Mucous membrane (especially oral) involvement is usually the first sign.
There may be superficial exfoliation after slight pressure (Nikolsky’s sign).
• Bullous pemphigoid: tense blisters, typically in flexural areas. They may be preceded by urticarial or
eczematous lesions.
• Porphyria cutanea tarda: blistering on exposed areas.
• Erythema multiforme: see above.

Papular and nodular lesions
• Hyperkeratotic: warts, corns, seborrhoeic keratoses.
• Purple: lichen planus (see Ch. 36); Kaposi’s
sarcoma – malignant skin lesions with dark plaques
or nodules on cutaneous or mucosal surfaces, common in people with human immunodeficiency
virus infection.
• Flesh-coloured and umbilicated: molluscum
contagiosum – a viral infection causing single or
multiple, rounded, dome-shaped, waxy papules,

2–5 mm in diameter, which are umbilicated and
contain a caseous plug; keratoacanthoma – a rapidly
growing, usually benign skin tumour with a crater
topped with keratin debris.
Pearly: basal cell carcinoma – most commonly nodular with a central erosion and rolled edges, though
can be superficial, waxy or pigmented; intradermal
naevi.
Small, red, and inflammatory: acne, miliaria, candidiasis, intertrigo, scabies, folliculitis.
Erythema nodosum: painful red nodules without ulceration on the anterior aspects of the legs; they may
regress over weeks to resemble contusions.
Furuncles (boils): painful inflammatory swellings of
a hair follicle forming an abscess, usually caused by
S. aureus.
Epidermoid cyst.

Photodermatoses
Painful erythema, oedema and vesiculation on sunexposed surfaces, usually the face, neck, hands and
upper chest. Causes include drugs (e.g. amiodarone,
phenothiazines, sulphonamides and related drugs),
polymorphic light eruption and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Maculopapular lesions
• Morbilliform drug eruptions, most commonly due
to antibiotics and anti-epileptics.
• Exanthemata due to viral (e.g. measles) or bacterial
infection (e.g. scarlet fever).
• Secondary syphilis.
HINTS AND TIPS
Drug eruptions may mimic any inflammatory skin
condition. They usually start abruptly and are a
widespread, symmetrical, erythematous eruption.
Constitutional symptoms such as malaise, arthralgia,
headache and fever may be present.

Erosive lesions
• Any vesicular or blistering lesion can leave behind an
erosion, for instance impetigo, vesicular dermatitis
or pemphigus.
• Erosive lichen planus: affects the mucous membranes.

Ulcerated lesions
• Decubitus ulcers: bed sores or pressure sores.
• Skin cancers.

Parasitic infections, e.g. leishmaniasis.
Syphilis: primary chancre.
Venous or arterial insufficiency.
Neuropathic ulcers: particularly in diabetes.

Petechial and purpuric lesions
• Thrombocytopenia: primary or secondary.
• Coagulation disorders, e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation.
• Vascular disorders, e.g. vasculitis.

Miscellanous lesions
• Candidiasis: superficial, denuded, red areas with or
without satellite vesicopustules. There are whitish,
curd-like concretions on the oral and vaginal mucous membranes.
• Cellulitis: a hot, red, diffuse, spreading infection of
the skin.
• Erysipelas: oedematous, spreading, circumscribed,
hot, erythematous area, with or without vesicle or
bulla formation, frequently involving the face.
• Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal
necrolysis: usually caused by a reaction to medication. There is a rapidly spreading erythematous rash
which may merge to form large areas of skin detachment. Mucosal involvement is common and mortality is high.
• Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: widespread
erythematous blistering skin lesions due to release
of staphylococcal toxins.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
SKIN RASHES
The following long list of factors should be assessed
when taking a history in the patient with skin rashes:
• Rash: onset, duration.
• Aggravating factors: physical or chemical agents;
cold (cold urticaria or cryoglobulinaemia); heat
(worsens seborrhoeic conditions and superficial
skin conditions).
• Precipitants: stress may lead to alopecia or eczema.
• Site of origin: contact dermatitis and pityriasis rosea
(herald patch).
• Rate of progression or alteration of lesions.
• Timing of change in skin lesions, particularly for
moles.
• Associated hair and nail abnormalities.
• Possible infective agents: foreign travel (tropical infections), pets (papular urticaria or animal scabies), farm
animals (orf (poxvirus), ringworm), close contacts.

127

Skin lesions and rash
• Chemical exposure: at home or work, acting as antigens or direct irritants. Ask about soap and laundry
detergent.
• Foods: nuts and shellfish.
• Light exposure: herpes simplex, SLE and vitiligo.
• Occupation.
• Current medication, including over-the-counter
drugs; steroids may make the rash better (as in dermatitis) or worse (as in acne). Have any drugs been
recently started or altered?
• General health and past medical history.
• Family history: important in eczema, psoriasis,
inherited skin disorders.
• Patient’s explanation for rash.
Systemic symptoms should be assessed, and may take
the following forms:
• Itching (Fig. 21.1): atopy or urticaria, scabies, eczema, dermatitis herpetiformis, lichen planus, flexural psoriasis.
• Pain: inflammatory conditions, skin tumours.
Finally, the mode of spread is significant and may take
the form of an annular appearance (e.g. erythema annulare, erythema multiforme and fungal infections) or
irregular spread (e.g. pyoderma gangrenosum or
malignancy).
HINTS AND TIPS
Fixed drug eruptions occur at the same site each time a
patient takes a medication. With repeated exposure,
the number of involved sites may increase.

COMMUNICATION
Skin diseases affecting exposed areas such as the face
can have a devastating effect on patients that is
often disproportionate to the severity of the disease.
Careful questioning of the patient’s concerns and
appropriate reassurance that the condition can be
treated are important aspects of managing
dermatological problems.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
A SKIN RASH
Always examine the entire skin, but maintain the dignity of the patient, and look in the mouth (e.g. with lichen planus, herpes simplex and zoster, and infective
exanthemata). Rashes may change with time and become characteristic or diagnostic of common dermatoses, such as the infectious exanthemata. Look at the
distribution of lesions:
• If widespread and symmetrical, suspect systemic
disease.
• If only areas exposed to the sun are involved, suspect
light sensitivity.
• A dermatomal distribution suggests herpes zoster.
• Dermatitis involving the hands, face, axillae, ears
and eyelids suggests contact dermatitis.
• Dermatitis involving the axillae, groins, scalp, the
central chest and back, eyebrows, ears and beard suggests seborrhoeic dermatitis.
• Dermatitis involving the popliteal and cubital fossae
and the face suggests atopic dermatitis.
Describe the lesions. Terms and characteristics of dermatological lesions are given in Fig. 21.2. Certain features may be especially helpful, for instance:
• Bizarrely shaped lesions suggest that the cause is an
external agent (e.g. caustic liquid or a self-induced
injury – ‘dermatitis artefacta’).
• Fungal infections are characterized by slow growth, a
smooth outline, an active edge with a healing centre
and asymmetry.
• Non-blanching lesions quickly narrow the differential diagnosis.

COMMUNICATION
When referring a patient with skin lesions ensure you
have fully examined the patient and are confident
you can describe the lesions accurately.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH SKIN RASHES
HINTS AND TIPS
In the patient presenting with subcutaneous nodules,
think of the following:
• Rheumatoid nodules.
• Rheumatic fever.
• Polyarteritis.
• Xanthelasmata.
• Tuberous sclerosis.
• Neurofibromatosis.
• Sarcoidosis.

The history and examination may be enough to determine the diagnosis. If the patient is not unwell it may
be possible to examine for skin changes over time,
thereby allowing the development of characteristic lesions. The following investigations should be considered:
• Blood tests: full blood count, urea and electrolytes,
bacterial and viral titres with immunological tests for
tropical diseases if appropriate, and blood cultures.
• Skin scrapings and nail clippings: fungi.
• Examination of the skin under UV light (e.g. fungal/
bacterial infections, tuberous sclerosis, porphyria).
• Examination of brushings of household pets: mites.
• Culture of fluid-containing lesions.
• Skin biopsy.
• Investigations for suspected systemic diseases or
malignancy suggested by the history, examination
or initial investigations.

22

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The differential diagnosis of an episode of loss of consciousness.
• The systematic approach to assessing a patient presenting with loss of consciousness.
• How to investigate patients and identify the underlying cause.

INTRODUCTION
Loss of consciousness may be transient (’blackouts’)
or ongoing (coma). Many patients are admitted to hospital with ‘collapse?cause’. This term is rarely helpful as
patients use the word ‘collapse’ to describe a variety of
situations, and it is essential to determine whether or
not the patient has actually lost consciousness. In addition, the collapse may be mistakenly labelled as a
transient ischaemic attack (TIA) when there is little supporting evidence of posterior circulation ischaemia, and
other diagnoses are more likely.
COMMUNICATION
Many patients use the terms dizziness, lightheadedness, fall, faint, loss of consciousness and
collapse interchangeably. Careful questioning is
needed to establish whether the patient had a true
syncopal episode, as this is key to making the correct
diagnosis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

Blackouts
Many patients describe transient episodes of blacking
out, which are often recurrent. Some of these patients
have syncope: a transient loss of consciousness and postural tone due to a reduction in cerebral perfusion with
spontaneous recovery. The causes of blackouts are summarized in Fig. 22.1.

Coma
In coma, the patient remains unconscious and is unrousable. The causes of coma are summarized in Fig. 22.2.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00022-1

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
COMMUNICATION
Always try to obtain a collateral history from a witness,
even if the patient has regained consciousness.

When a patient presents unconscious, relatives or the
general practitioner should be contacted to gain information regarding previous medical history, prodromal
illness, known alcohol or drug abuse, and whether
the events leading to the coma were witnessed by
anyone.
In syncope, the history should focus on the following
details.

Before the event
• Find out what the patient was doing at the time.
• Ask about any symptoms occurring prior to the
event.
• Syncope due to postural hypotension often occurs
after standing up suddenly.
• Prior to an epileptic seizure, there is often an aura.
• In arrhythmia, the patient can be aware of palpitations, chest pain or dyspnoea before blacking out.
• Episodes of bradycardia may cause collapse without
any warning (Stokes–Adams attacks).
• Exertional syncope is seen in aortic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
• Occasionally, syncope can occur following cough,
micturition, swallowing or straining during
defecation.
• Syncope on head-turning may suggest carotid sinus
hypersensitivity or rotational vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Very rarely, subclavian steal may cause syncope during exercise of an arm.

The attack itself
• What happened during the episode itself? This is
where the history of a witness is vitally important.
• Prolonged seizure activity associated with tongue biting, particularly the side of the tongue, are suggestive
of epilepsy. Any cause of cerebral hypoxia may result
in brief anoxic seizures, which may be more prolonged if the patient is upright. Urinary incontinence
can be a feature of both syncope and epilepsy.
• In Stokes–Adams attacks, the patient typically
becomes very pale, with flushing on recovery. The
length of time that the patient remained unconscious should be recorded.
• If available, the pulse rate during the episode can
help (e.g. bradycardia or absent pulse in Stokes–
Adams attack). If the attack occurs in hospital the
blood pressure and blood glucose should be
recorded during the episode.

Following the event
• How quickly did the patient recover? Syncope is
generally followed by rapid recovery. However, in
epilepsy there is usually postictal sleepiness or
disorientation.

Examining the patient with loss of consciousness
• Focal neurological impairment after recovery of consciousness may suggest TIA (though TIA only rarely
presents with blackout) or Todd’s paresis following a
seizure (see Ch. 34).
• It is also very important to ask whether the patient
hurt themselves during the episode. If there is significant injury, consider cardiac syncope (lack of warning) or seizure.

Risk factors
• Is there a previous history of similar episodes or of
epilepsy, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease or
obstructive airways disease?
• Does the patient have cardiovascular risk factors or a
relevant family history (e.g. HCM)?
• Is the patient on insulin or a healthcare worker with
access to insulin?
• Is there a history of drug abuse or depression?
• Has there been any previous head trauma?

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Fig. 22.3 summarizes the examination approach. The
emphasis of the examination differs between the sick
comatose patient and one with recurrent blackouts.
These approaches are outlined below.

Coma patient
• Always start with ABCDE: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability (i.e. Glasgow coma scale – see
Fig. 22.4), Exposure.
• Urgent observations: pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, capillary glucose and
arterial blood gas.
• Survey for injuries: especially closed head injury and
evidence of skull fracture such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid in ears, or Battle’s sign (bruising over
the mastoid process).

The Glasgow coma scale is used in assessing loss of consciousness in
a patient.

• Check for evidence of liver disease, diabetes mellitus,
IV drug use (e.g. signs of chronic liver disease or
injection sites). Consider hepatic encephalopathy,
diabetic coma, opiate or other overdose.
• Is there a characteristic smell: alcohol, ketones, hepatic fetor?
• Look for signs of meningism (meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage) and rash (meningococcal meningitis classically gives petechial or purpuric rash).
• Examine pupils and eye movement (see Fig. 22.5).
• Cardiovascular examination: arrhythmia (including
atrial fibrillation which predisposes to stroke), murmurs or other evidence of bacterial endocarditis.
• Respiratory: focal consolidation, evidence of COPD
and carbon dioxide retention.
• Abdomen: gastrointestinal haemorrhage, ascites
(which may be infected), organomegaly, peritonism.
• Neurological examination: focal neurology suggests
intracranial cause.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember to look for items hinting as to the cause of
loss of consciousness, i.e. medic alert bracelets, neck
tags or wallet cards.

Patient with blackouts
• Lying and standing blood pressure.
• Thorough cardiovascular and neurological examination.
• Remember to examine fully for any injuries sustained.

134

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
HINTS AND TIPS
A blood glucose test should be performed urgently in all
unconscious patients to exclude hypoglycaemia.

Investigation will be guided by findings in the history
and clinical examination. The following investigations
are useful in the different clinical scenarios:

Investigating the patient with loss of consciousness
• Full blood count: anaemia in severe haemorrhage or
haemolysis (malaria); leukocytosis in sepsis.
• Urea and electrolytes: hypo- or hypernatraemia.
• Calcium: hypocalcaemia.
• Glucose: hypoglycaemia/hyperglycaemia.
• Creatine kinase: rhabdomyolysis (if lying unconscious for a prolonged period).
• Liver function tests (biochemistry and synthetic
function): liver failure.
• Thyroid function tests: hypothyroidism (myxoedema coma).
• Electrocardiogram: arrhythmia, left ventricular hypertrophy in aortic stenosis and HCM.
• Arterial blood gases: hypercapnia, hypoxia, acid–
base status. The ABG may also give you a quick
potassium and glucose reading.
• Chest X-ray: pulmonary disease, aspiration pneumonia.
• Septic screen: cultures of blood, urine, ascitic fluid.
• Drug screen of urine and blood.
• Computed tomography head scan: intracranial
pathology.
• Carotid Dopplers: carotid artery stenosis.
• 24-h or 7-day ECG monitoring for arrhythmia.
• Echocardiogram: heart rhythm, source of emboli,
aortic stenosis, HCM.
• Lumbar puncture: meningitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage.

22

• Tilt-table testing: patients are moved from a recumbent to an upright position with monitoring of their
pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and symptoms. Those with orthostatic (postural) hypotension
show an early drop in blood pressure (within 2–
3 min) whereas those with vasovagal syndrome
show a delayed response (up to 45 min) in which
the blood pressure alone may drop (vasodepressor
response), bradycardia may occur, causing hypotension (cardioinhibitory response), or a mixture of the
two. In some centres, carotid sinus massage is performed in combination with tilt-table testing to increase its sensitivity at diagnosing carotid sinus
hypersensitivity (which may also manifest with a
vasodepressor response, cardioinhibitory response
or a mixture of the two).
• Electroencephalogram (EEG): epilepsy (including
non-convulsive status epilepticus), viral encephalitis.

HINTS AND TIPS
Carotid Dopplers should only be requested for clinical
syndromes suggesting unilateral anterior cerebral
circulation infarction where carotid intervention would
be considered.

Confusional states

23

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The definition and causes of confusional states.
• How to assess a confused patient.
• How to approach the investigation of confusional states.

INTRODUCTION
Confusion can be acute, subacute, or chronic, and may
be reversible or progressive. It is often divided into delirium (acute or subacute onset of fluctuating disturbance of consciousness with change in cognition) or
dementia (progressive disease of the brain causing
impairment of higher cortical function without impairment of consciousness). Any cause of delirium can precipitate an acute exacerbation of dementia – ‘acute on
chronic confusion’. Confusional states are very common, particularly in the elderly, and are often worsened
by admission to hospital.
COMMUNICATION
When a patient presents with confusion it is essential
to talk to family members or carers. Try to establish
whether the problem is long-standing and getting
worse or is a new presentation.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
CONFUSIONAL STATE

Delirium
There are many causes of delirium in the elderly patient;
the most common are summarized in Fig. 23.1.

Dementia
The causes of dementia are summarized in Fig. 23.2.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00023-3

HINTS AND TIPS
It is important to remember that depression can
sometimes mimic dementia (‘pseudodementia’). Other
psychiatric illnesses causing psychosis and severe
anxiety may present in a very similar manner to acute
confusional states with an organic cause.

HISTORY IN THE CONFUSED
PATIENT
The first step is to establish whether the patient is newly
confused or if there is a history of dementia, and if so
whether the confusion is worse than normal. A good
account from relatives, carers or close friends is almost
always the only way of getting a true picture of the pattern
of disease. The previous hospital notes can be an invaluable source of information, and a thorough social history
is essential to put the patient’s problems in context. The
history should then focus on possible underlying causes.

Pattern of confusion
HINTS AND TIPS
Severe symptoms of ‘delirium tremens’ due to alcohol
withdrawal may occur 24–48 h after the patient’s last
drink, and long after their admission to hospital.

Delirium develops over hours or days. It is characterized
by clouding of consciousness that fluctuates in severity,

often worse at night with lucid periods in the day. It can
be accompanied by poor recent memory, disorientation
and hallucinations. As a result, the patient may be agitated, uncooperative and sometimes paranoid, though
behaviour may also be underactive.
Dementia usually has a gradual onset over months or
years. It is characterized by a global deterioration in
higher cerebral function with no change in level of consciousness, tends to be progressive and is often exacerbated when the patient is removed from familiar
surroundings, such as by admission to hospital. Vascular
dementia may present as ‘multi-infarct’ dementia, progressing in a stepwise fashion, or slowly and gradually
in a manner indistinguishable from Alzheimer’s disease.
A more rapid onset is seen in Creutzfeldt–Jakob
disease (CJD), hydrocephalus and depression. The depressed patient often complains of memory loss (unlike
patients with early dementia, who may not be aware of
the problem), makes poor effort at testing and may have
a personal or family history of depression.

Possible underlying causes
The following should be assessed, as they may reveal an
underlying cause:
• Age: dementia becomes increasingly common after
the age of 60 years. A thorough search for a treatable
underlying cause should be made, particularly in
younger patients.
• Symptoms of focal infection (see Ch. 8).
• Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (see Ch. 18).
• Risk factors for, or known, vascular disease
(see Ch. 30).
• Dietary history: vitamin deficiency.
• Alcohol intake: while chronic alcohol abuse can cause
dementia in its own right, it may also be associated
with thiamine deficiency (Wernicke–Korsakoff
syndrome) as well as folate and B12 deficiency, both
of which may increase the risk of dementia.
• Previous head injury or evidence of falls: subdural
haematoma.
• Other neurological symptoms: cerebrovascular
disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral tumour/abscess,
inflammatory or autoimmune neurological disease.
• Symptoms of endocrine disease, particularly hypoor hyperthyroidism.
• Previous medical history of any disease may be
relevant: long-standing renal disease (uraemia),
liver disease (encephalopathy), malignancy (cerebral metastases, hypercalcaemia or paraneoplastic
syndromes, e.g. encephalitis), diabetes (insulin overdose), endocrine disease (thyroid disorders, Addison’s disease).
• Drug history: particular attention should be given to
sedatives, anticonvulsants and steroids. Has the patient ever used illegal drugs?

Examining the confused patient
• Family history: Wilson’s disease (autosomal recessive); Huntington’s chorea (autosomal dominant);
depression.
• Brief psychiatric history: notably for features of
depression.
• Sexual history may provide information regarding
the possibility of HIV, hepatitis or syphilis.

EXAMINING THE CONFUSED
PATIENT
Since the causes of confusion are so varied, a thorough
clinical examination is mandatory. This approach is
summarized in Fig. 23.3. Particular attention should
be given to the following:
• Consciousness: the level of consciousness should
be recorded using the Glasgow coma scale (see
Fig. 22.4).
• Blood pressure: hypotension may be due to sepsis or
cardiac failure. Hypertension is a risk factor for cerebrovascular events and can also be a response to
raised intracranial pressure.
• Cyanosis: hypoxia is a common cause of confusion
in patients in hospital. The oxygen saturation should
be measured.

Heart

23

• Capillary glucose: hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia
(DKA and HONK syndrome).
• Evidence of head injury: subdural haematoma.
• Signs of infection: measure temperature, look for
neck stiffness, consolidation in the chest, signs of
endocarditis, abdominal tenderness, otitis media
on otoscopy, pressure areas and skin for evidence
of cellulitis (see Ch. 8).
• Mental state: The 10-point abbreviated mental test
score (see Fig. 23.4) is useful for confirming confusion and may be used serially to monitor progress.
The 30-point MMSE (mini-mental state examination) is mandatory if querying a new diagnosis of
dementia, to document cognitive function and provide a baseline for future assessment. In many cases
more comprehensive assessment is required in due
course, for instance with the Addenbrooke’s cognitive examination.
• Focal neurological deficit and the pattern of signs may
give important clues as to the diagnosis (see Chs 24
and 26): fundoscopy should be performed looking
for papilloedema (raised intracranial pressure), optic
atrophy (demyelination) or subhyaloid haemorrhages (subarachnoid haemorrhage). Parkinsonism
may be present in Parkinson’s disease and Parkinson
plus syndromes. Myoclonus, extrapyramidal signs
and aphasia are features of CJD.
• Signs of chronic liver disease, particularly a liver flap
(asterixis): hepatic encephalopathy commonly
causes confusion. Chronic liver disease may also indicate chronic alcohol abuse or rare disorders such
as Wilson’s disease.
• Malignancy: examine thoroughly – breasts, digital
rectal examination for prostate and bowel pathology,

• Signs of endocrine disorders, particularly thyroid
disease and Addison’s disease (see Ch. 35).
COMMUNICATION
It is often difficult to examine confused patients and
signs can be missed. Having a family member or nurse
present may help to calm and position the patient.

INVESTIGATING THE CONFUSED
PATIENT
There is much overlap in the investigation of delirium
and dementia despite the difference in urgency. The
following tests should be considered.

• Thyroid function tests: thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH) usually raised in hypothyroidism and low in
hyperthyroidism.
• Serum calcium: hyper- or hypocalcaemia.
• Serum glucose: hypoglycaemia.
• Arterial blood gases for hypoxia.
• Blood cultures if considering infection.
• Vitamin B12 and folate levels: deficiency. Red blood
cell folate is a more reliable indicator of long-term
deficiency than serum folate.
• Syphilis serology: tertiary syphilis may cause dementia.

Radiology
A chest X-ray may show pneumonia, cardiac failure or
malignancy. Computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging of the head should be considered to look for tumour, infarction, haematoma,
hydrocephalus and abscess.

Initial tests

Further tests

Routine observations, including oxygen saturation, capillary glucose, urinalysis and ECG, can all be performed
quickly and may give an almost immediate clue as to the
underlying cause.

Consider the following when clinically indicated:

Blood tests
• Full blood count: reactive blood picture in malignancy, infection or inflammation; anaemia with
raised mean corpuscular volume in vitamin B12 or
folate deficiency.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: raised in malignancy, infection, inflammation.
• Urea and electrolytes: hypo- or hypernatraemia and
renal failure.
• Liver function tests: abnormal in liver disease.
Gamma-glutamyltransferase may indicate recent
excess alcohol consumption.

140

• Urine: toxicology screen, culture for urinary
infection.
• Red cell transketolase for thiamine deficiency.
• Electroencephalogram: typical temporal lobe seizure
foci of herpes simplex encephalitis.
• Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination: protein, glucose, microscopy, culture and oligoclonal bands.
• Autoimmune screen including autoimmune encephalitis antibodies.
• Ammonia – often raised in liver disease. Also caused
by defects in metabolism (see Ch. 34).
• Serum copper and caeruloplasmin (reduced) and
24-h urinary copper excretion (increased): Wilson’s
disease.
• Borrelia serology for Lyme’s disease.
• Thick and thin blood films: malaria.
• HIV serology.

Stroke and transient
ischaemic attack

24

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The definitions and differential diagnosis of stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
• A logical approach to assessing the patient with a stroke or TIA.
• The investigation of patients presenting with acute neurological deficits.

INTRODUCTION
A stroke is a neurological deficit due to vascular disturbance that develops over minutes (sometimes hours)
and persists for at least 24 h. Identical deficits lasting less
than 24 h are termed transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs).
Stroke is often also called ‘cerebrovascular accident’
(CVA) or ‘cerebrovascular event’ (CVE), but the term
‘stroke’ should be used to avoid confusion. Cerebral infarction (mainly embolism or thrombosis) accounts for
80% of strokes; 20% are caused by intracerebral haemorrhage. Fig. 24.1 outlines the principal types and causes.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF STROKE
The diagnosis is often clear from the history and examination but the following pathologies can also produce
a clinical picture that is identical to stroke and should be
considered in atypical presentations:
• Subdural haematoma: particularly in the elderly and
in alcohol misuse.
• Space-occupying lesions: e.g. tumour (primary or
secondary) or cerebral abscess (consider if patient
has bronchiectasis or heart murmur suggesting
endocarditis).
• Epilepsy: postictal (Todd’s) paresis following seizure
(generalized or partial).
• Hemiplegic migraine: typical features of migraine
also present, resolving within 24 h.
• Toxic/metabolic cause: hypo- and hyperglycaemia,
hyponatraemia, drug overdose.
• Demyelination: e.g. multiple sclerosis.

HISTORY IN THE STROKE PATIENT
The history should focus on three distinct areas. First,
does the history fit with the diagnosis of stroke? Second,
© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00024-5

where is the anatomical site of the lesion? Finally, are
any risk factors present?

The pattern of onset
The key feature in stroke is that the symptoms develop
rapidly over a few minutes, or less commonly hours, but
once the deficit is complete it remains stable and usually
improves. If there has been gradual neurological deterioration, consider one of the differential diagnoses or
hydrocephalus secondary to the stroke (oedema or
blood preventing free drainage of cerebrospinal fluid).
Improvement can be complete but there is often some
residual deficit.

The site of the lesion
Any intracranial artery can be involved in stroke. The
symptoms and signs will reflect which artery and therefore which part of the brain has been involved. This is
summarized in Fig. 24.2.

Underlying risk factors
Fig. 24.3 shows the main risk factors for stroke; many
are common to all vascular disease (see Ch. 30).
HINTS AND TIPS
If the patient has atrial fibrillation calculate their risk of
further stroke using a risk-scoring system such as the
CHADS2 score (see Ch. 34) to allow a reasoned
decision regarding anticoagulation.

EXAMINING THE STROKE

important areas in the stroke patient.

• What are the neurological abnormalities and do they
fit with the diagnosis of stroke?
• Is there any evidence of an underlying cause?
• Have any complications arisen as a result of the stroke?
• What acute treatment is needed?
Fig. 24.4 summarizes this examination approach.

Has the patient had a stroke?
A thorough neurological examination should be performed, including a Glasgow coma score (GCS). Does
the pattern of neurological deficit fit with disruption of
the cerebral vascular supply (see Fig. 24.2)? Remember

142

that the GCS is imperfect in stroke as dysphasia and aphasia reduce the verbal score. Pay particular attention to the
pattern of upper motor neurone weakness, hemianopia,
dysphasia and sensory/visual inattention. This enables
you to place the patient in the Bamford classification,
which has important prognostic implications (Fig. 24.5).
COMMUNICATION
Taking a history from a patient with a stroke can be
challenging. The patient may have a receptive or
expressive dysphasia and could have visual impairment
from a homonymous hemianopia. It is important to
position yourself where the patient can see you to
maximize communication with the patient. A collateral
history may be required.

Determining the likely site of the lesion helps to focus
the search for an underlying cause (e.g. carotid bruits
in an anterior or middle cerebral artery stroke).

Is there any evidence of an
underlying cause?
There are many causes and risk factors for stroke.
However, pay particular attention to the following:
• Carotid bruits: carotid atheroma.
• Murmurs: endocarditis, valvular disease, atrial septal
defect.
• Pulse: atrial fibrillation.
• Blood pressure: hypertension can be the cause or result of stroke; prolonged hypotension can also cause
stroke.
• Diminished peripheral pulses and femoral bruits:
peripheral vascular disease.
• Xanthelasmata, xanthomata: underlying hyperlipidaemia
• Temporal artery tenderness: giant cell arteritis.
• Tar-stained fingers from smoking.

Have any complications
developed?
Complications are very common following stroke, both
acutely and during recovery, and are related to the extent
of cerebral damage and the degree of neurological deficit. The more common problems, and protective
measures, are outlined in Fig. 24.6.

What acute intervention
is needed?
There is strong evidence that the acute management of
stroke influences outcome. At present this involves the
use of antiplatelet agents, good fluid balance, glycaemic

control, normothermia and correction of hypoxia.
Acute thrombolysis is widely used in the UK; trials indicate that there is a benefit in patients who present up to
4.5 h after the onset of symptoms, despite the increased
risk of haemorrhage, but the cut-off time of 3 h is more
widely used. It is performed following exclusion of

intracerebral haemorrhage by computed tomography
(CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and done in centres with expertise and experience in
the treatment. Exclusion criteria are numerous and
among others include mild or rapidly improving neurological deficits, severely uncontrolled hypertension,
recent surgery and current anticoagulant therapy. The
NIHSS score must be calculated prior to administration
of thrombolysis; this score takes into account features of
the patient’s syndrome to assess severity and whether
thrombolysis is warranted.

INVESTIGATING THE STROKE
PATIENT
The diagnosis of stroke remains a clinical one. The purpose of acute investigations is to look for treatable
causes and offer the best supportive care. In the acute
stroke patient the following investigations should
be considered.

HINTS AND TIPS
Calculation of the risk of further vascular events
following a TIA using a risk scoring system such as the
ABCD2 score (see Ch. 34) may be helpful in guiding
clinical decisions.

Simple early tests
• Capillary glucose: to rule out hypoglycaemia.
• Routine bedside observations: blood pressure, pulse
and oxygen saturations will give a quick indication
of the development of complications.
• ECG: this may show atrial fibrillation, or potentially
(and much more rarely) ventricular aneurysm following recent myocardial infarction.

144

Legs
— Peripheral vascular
disease
— Femoral bruits

Blood tests
• Full blood count: polycythaemia may cause a stroke;
a reactive picture may indicate inflammation (e.g.
temporal arteritis).
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein:
elevated in inflammation, vasculitis, infection and
malignancy.
• Urea and electrolytes: renal impairment may either
be due to, or the cause of, hypertension. It may also
result from reduced oral intake or concurrent sepsis.
• Blood glucose: diabetes is associated with increased
risk of stroke. Hypoglycaemia may present with
stroke-like symptoms or signs, and prolonged severe
hypoglycaemia may result in permanent brain
injury.
• Fasting lipids: hypercholesterolaemia is an important, treatable, risk factor for stroke.

• Clotting: to assess level of anticoagulation if the patient is receiving warfarin or to investigate suspected
coagulopathy.

Imaging
• CT brain scan: this is indicated within 24 h of admission in all stroke cases, although it is increasingly
performed within just a few hours of presentation.
In some situations it is required urgently; these are
outlined in Fig. 24.7. Most patients with TIA will also
need acute imaging of the brain.
• MRI brain scan: this is indicated if posterior circulation
stroke is suspected, and is recommended following
TIA due to its increased sensitivity for small lesions.
• Chest X-ray: this is not routinely required, but should
be performed if the clinical scenario indicates.

Further investigations
Depending on the patient and the clinical scenario, further tests may be required. The following further investigations should be considered, especially in young
patients with no obvious risk factors:

• Blood cultures: infective endocarditis.
• Carotid imaging (ultrasound or CT/MR angiography): if anterior circulation stroke and carotid intervention would be considered.
• Echocardiogram: cardiac source of embolus –
vegetations or thrombus. The echo can be contrast
enhanced (‘bubble echo’) to look for septal defects,
e.g. patent foramen ovale (PFO).
• Autoantibodies: may provide evidence of vasculitis
(antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), antiphospholipid syndrome
(anticardiolipin antibodies) or cerebral lupus
(anti-double-stranded DNA).
• Thrombophilia screen.
• Cerebral angiography/venography or radiological
equivalent: this may be performed if there are additional signs or symptoms suggesting an unusual
cause of infarction or haemorrhage, such as venous
sinus thrombosis, arterial dissection or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
• 24-h electrocardiogram monitoring: paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation.
• Syphilis serology: neurosyphilis.

Lymphadenopathy and
splenomegaly

25

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
• How to systematically assess a patient presenting with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.
• The sequence of investigations necessary to establish the underlying cause.

INTRODUCTION
Splenomegaly is often a focus of short case or objective
structured clinical examinations because many of its
causes are chronic. Lymphadenopathy is a common
presentation to healthcare services; it may be localized
or generalized.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF LYMPHADENOPATHY
AND SPLENOMEGALY

Localized lymphadenopathy
Consider which structures have lymphatic drainage to
the nodes affected and examine these carefully for the
following:
• Local infection: bacterial, viral, TB.
• Metastases: local malignancy (e.g. the breast in axillary lymphadenopathy).
• Lymphoma: Hodgkin’s disease or non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma.

• Drugs: phenytoin occasionally causes lymphadenopathy with significant constitutional symptoms
(‘pseudolymphoma’). Other causes include allopurinol and isoniazid.
• Other: lipid storage diseases, rare haematological
causes.

Splenomegaly
Traditionally splenomegaly is divided into three groups,
massive, moderate and mild splenomegaly. However, it
is often difficult to distinguish accurately (see Ch. 2).

Massive splenomegaly
• Myeloproliferative disease: chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis (also called agnogenic myeloid
metaplasia), and, less commonly, polycythaemia vera.
• Malaria: rare in developed countries.
• Kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis): rare in developed
countries.
• Gaucher’s disease (lipid storage disorder).
• Lymphoproliferative disorders (see Ch. 37).
• Thalassaemia major.

Mild and moderate splenomegaly

Generalized lymphadenopathy

The above plus:

• Infection: particularly viral (Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV, rubella), but
also bacterial (tuberculosis (TB), syphilis, brucellosis) and protozoal (toxoplasmosis).
• Lymphoproliferative: Hodgkin’s disease or nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloblastic
leukaemia.
• Connective tissue disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease.
• Infiltration: sarcoidosis.

• Portal hypertension, commonly with liver cirrhosis
of any cause.
• Acute leukaemias.
• Infection: infectious mononucleosis, infectious hepatitis, infective endocarditis, TB, brucellosis, schistosomiasis.
• Haemolytic anaemias (see Ch. 37).
• Connective tissue disease: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (Felty’s syndrome).
• Infiltration: amyloid, sarcoid, metastasis of solid
malignancy.

147

Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly
• Myeloproliferative disorders: essential thrombocythaemia.
• Megaloblastic anaemias (see Ch. 37).
• Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may occasionally cause mild splenomegaly.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
LYMPHADENOPATHY OR
SPLENOMEGALY
It is often not possible to make a diagnosis on the basis
of the history in these patients. However, important
clues in the history can help to focus the clinical examination and further investigations.

Localized lymphadenopathy
Pain and rate of node enlargement
Lymphadenopathy associated with infection is often
painful and develops quickly. When due to lymphoma
or other malignancy, it is commonly painless and enlarges more slowly. Therefore, the acutely painful lymph
node, while more distressing to the patient, may be of
comfort to the examining doctor!
Sometimes the lymphadenopathy will not be noticed until it is large enough to cause disfigurement or
rubs against clothes.

Symptoms in local structures
Has the patient noticed pain, erythema or a mass in any
of the structures draining into the affected node, e.g.
cellulitis in inguinal lymphadenopathy or a breast mass
in axillary lymphadenopathy? Neurological signs may
be present due to a nodal mass pressing on a nerve or
plexus distant from the deficit.

Systemic symptoms
In lymphoma the patient may experience pruritus or ‘B
symptoms’ (fever, drenching night sweats, weight loss).
‘B symptoms’ indicate more extensive disease and a
worse prognosis (see Ch. 37).
COMMUNICATION
In patients with suspected Hodgkin’s lymphoma, ask
about alcohol use. Although rare, alcohol can produce
dramatic pain in the lymphadenopathy associated
with Hodgkin’s disease and the patient may have given
up drinking because of it.

148

Generalized lymphadenopathy
Infection and underlying malignancy – be it lymphoma
or metastatic – are the two top diagnoses here and questions are asked with this in mind. A full systemic enquiry
is essential in these patients as most of the causes of generalized lymphadenopathy can affect multiple systems,
and a suggestion of distant primary malignancy may only
become clear with thorough questioning. Special attention should be paid to the following:
• Malaise, anorexia and general debility: common but
non-specific.
• ‘B symptoms’: haematological malignancy.
• Skin rash: rubella, SLE and sarcoidosis.
• Arthralgia and arthropathy: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis
and (rarely) syphilis (arthritis in secondary syphilis or
Charcot joints in advanced tertiary syphilis).
• Infectious contacts: rubella, TB and EBV.
• Risk factors for HIV infection (see Ch. 38).
• Travel, sexual and occupational history.
• Contact with animals (zoonoses).
• Drug history: phenytoin.

Splenomegaly
Previous medical history
Enquire carefully about any pre-existing illness (as listed
above) or previous conditions that might cause or be related to splenomegaly, e.g. chronic liver disease resulting
in portal hypertension; connective tissue disease; previous malignancy; damaged cardiac valves (rheumatic fever or prosthetic valve) that might underlie subacute
infective endocarditis.

Recent travel abroad or infectious contacts
Consider infectious mononucleosis, TB, schistosomiasis, kala-azar and malaria.

Systemic symptoms
Systemic symptoms suggestive of an underlying cause
include arthralgia, rash, anorexia and ‘B symptoms’
(as above).

Symptoms of haematological disturbance
In bone marrow failure, splenomegaly may occur as a
result of extramedullary haematopoiesis; in splenomegaly from other causes, the enlarged spleen may itself
cause deficiencies in any of the three cell lines (‘hypersplenism’). There may be malaise, breathlessness and
lethargy if anaemia is present; recurrent infection may
occur with leukopenia; and mucosal and petechial bleeding may indicate thrombocytopenia.

(overlying bowel)

First, the extent, sites, size, consistency, tenderness and
fixation of enlarged lymph nodes should be documented. Normal reactive nodes are generally less than 1 cm
in diameter, feel soft, are not fixed and can be tender.
Lymphomatous nodes are often larger and feel rubbery
but are not fixed. Lymph nodes infiltrated by carcinoma
feel hard and may be fixed to surrounding tissue.
Cervical, occipital, supraclavicular, axillary and inguinal
areas should be palpated carefully. Small (shotty) inguinal nodes may be palpable in slim, healthy individuals.

If splenomegaly is present, the size from the left costal margin must be recorded.
It is important to distinguish the left kidney from
the spleen when palpating a mass in the left hypochondrium and the differences between the two are commonly asked for in examinations (see Fig. 25.2). The
presence or absence of hepatomegaly is important in
clinical practice, and hepatosplenomegaly is a common
scenario in exams.

Anaemia and petechial bleeding/purpura may be present as described above. Jaundice may result from liver
disease or haemolysis. Cachexia should warn of underlying malignancy.
Fig. 25.3 summarizes clinical findings that may point
to particular diagnoses. Evidence of chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE should also be
looked for as described in Chs 13 and 19. Needle marks
of drug misuse may indicate previous exposure to HIV
and hepatitis B or C, and be a portal of entry for bacteria
in infective endocarditis.

Localized lymphadenopathy
Hands
— Chronic liver
disease
— Rheumatoid
arthritis
— Splinter
haemorrhages
— Clubbing

Examine those structures with lymphatic drainage to the
affected nodes. Erythema, increased temperature and tenderness suggest infection, while a hard, non-tender mass
may indicate malignancy. When there is isolated cervical
lymphadenopathy, a formal ear, nose and throat examination should also be performed since oropharyngeal
malignancies commonly metastasize to these nodes.

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH LYMPHADENOPATHY OR
SPLENOMEGALY

Haematology
• A full blood count may show anaemia, leukopenia,
lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia or a combination
of these. In lympho- or myeloproliferative disease it
may show an excess of any of the three cell lines.
• A blood film can provide diagnostic information
(Fig. 25.4).
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate/plasma viscosity will
be elevated in infection, malignancy and inflammation.

Biochemistry
• LFTs: infective hepatitis of any cause, including CMV
and EBV, will cause abnormal transaminase levels;
elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyltranspeptidase will occur when the porta
hepatis is obstructed by enlarged lymph nodes;
unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia will be present
in haemolysis.

150

Many of these disorders may also be associated with a normocytic
anaemia. A leukoerythroblastic film will be seen wherever there
is heavy bone marrow involvement or severe illness. Autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia may also arise in lymphoma and chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia. AML, acute myeloid leukaemia; EBV,
Epstein–Barr virus.

• C-reactive protein will be elevated in infection, malignancy and inflammation.
• Lactate dehydrogenase: a useful prognostic marker
in lymphoma, and is often raised in haemolysis.
• Serum calcium: may be raised in malignancy, sarcoidosis and sometimes lymphoma.
• Serum uric acid: raised when there is rapid cell turnover, as in malignancy (especially haematological).
• Beta-2 microglobulin: this may give prognostic
information in lymphoma.

Immunology
• Autoimmune profile: useful in the diagnosis of
many autoimmune diseases, particularly connective
tissue disease (see Ch. 36).

Microbiology
• Monospot test: EBV.
• Serology: EBV, CMV, HIV, rubella, viral hepatitis,
toxoplasmosis. Further serology (e.g. brucellosis,
leishmaniasis) as per clinical suspicion.

25

Investigating the patient with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly
• Blood cultures: repeated if infective endocarditis is
suspected.
• Sputum culture: TB.

Imaging
• Chest X-ray: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
(caused by lymphoma, sarcoidosis and TB).
• Abdominal ultrasound scan: will confirm the presence of splenomegaly. It is poor at imaging the retroperitoneal lymph node chains.
• CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis: gives clear
staging information in malignancy and particularly
lymphoma, where retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy may often be missed by ultrasound scan.

Further investigations
• Lymph node excision biopsy: this allows thorough
assessment of lymph node infiltration and architecture, often providing a definitive diagnosis of
lymphadenopathy and its classification. Fine needle
aspiration (FNA) is often inadequate.

• Bone marrow examination: this includes aspiration,
trephine and cytogenetic analysis. It is indicated if
the blood count or film suggest haematological abnormalities and it is useful in the diagnosis of leukaemias,
myeloproliferative disorders, immune thrombocytopenias and pancytopenia. Occasionally, it is helpful
in storage diseases, lymphoma and carcinoma, where
there is marrow infiltration.
• If TB is suspected, induced sputum samples can be
obtained; if these are negative, bronchoscopy and
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples may be
required.
• Very rarely, a splenic biopsy is required to diagnose
the cause of splenomegaly.
HINTS AND TIPS
To enhance chances of palpating the spleen, lie
the patient on their right side and fix the lower ribs
with the left hand whilst palpating with the right
hand in inspiration.

Sensory and motor
neurological deficits

26

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• A basic understanding of neuroanatomy.
• How to use this as a guide to understanding the causes of sensory and motor neurological deficits.
• How to assess patients with neurological deficits and identify how these impact on their function.
• How to investigate patients presenting with neurological deficits.

INTRODUCTION
Muscle weakness or abnormal sensation can result from
disease occurring anywhere along the pathway from the
skin or muscle to the spinal cord and brain. The pathological processes are outlined below.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF SENSORY AND/OR MOTOR
NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS
The differential diagnosis is approached logically according to the likely anatomical site (the level of the lesion)
and the possible causes at that location (Fig. 26.1).

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
SENSORY AND/OR MOTOR
NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS
It is often a daunting prospect to be faced with a patient
with neurological symptoms or signs. However, despite
the vast number of potential underlying pathologies, a
lesion at a particular point in the pathway between
brain and muscle or skin will always produce the same
clinical signs regardless of the cause. There are five important aspects to consider in the history.

Pattern of deficit
Fig. 26.2 summarizes characteristic symptoms and signs
that arise as a consequence of a lesion at a particular
neurological level. If the neurological abnormalities
do not fit with a single localized lesion, consider MS,
motor neurone disease, paraneoplastic neuropathy,
multi-system disorders (e.g. sarcoidosis or vasculitis)
or, lastly, a functional disorder.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00026-9

Onset
This is extremely important. Sudden onset usually indicates a vascular problem such as infarction or haemorrhage. Lesions such as those due to trauma (e.g.
enlarging haematoma), multiple sclerosis (MS), infection
(e.g. abscess), acute prolapsed disc and myelitis can also
develop rapidly, e.g. over hours. An insidious onset, over
weeks to months, is more typical of cervical spondylosis,
motor neurone disease, neoplasm or myopathy.

Precipitants
Trauma may result in muscular and neurological deficits.
Acute myasthenia can be precipitated by intercurrent
illness (particularly infection) or drugs (aminoglycosides
or penicillamine). The incidence of MS relapses may increase postpartum and during systemic infections, and
symptoms may be exacerbated by exertion, hot weather,
or by a hot bath.

Progression
Many lesions cause gradually progressive, unremitting
disease, including tumours, motor neurone disease, hereditary ataxias, syringomyelia and degenerative brain
diseases. Intermittent deficits can be due to transient
ischaemic attacks, epilepsy, migraine and myasthenia
gravis. MS is characterized by the development of lesions which are dissociated in time and site. Symptoms
and signs due to trauma or vascular events may slowly
improve with time or remain static following the initial
event.

Evidence of cause
The following factors provide evidence of cause:
• Family history: e.g. hereditary ataxias, phenylketonuria, neurofibromatosis.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
SENSORY AND/OR MOTOR
NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS
When assessing a patient in clinic or hospital, a full neurological examination should be performed (see Ch. 2).
However, in medical school examinations you will

156

usually only be expected to assess a specific part of
the system, such as the eyes, face, legs, arms or gait.
The most common neurological short cases are peripheral neuropathy (usually due to diabetes mellitus),
Parkinson’s disease, stroke and multiple sclerosis, but
be prepared for anything!
It is important to remember that, in sensory problems, subjective sensation is usually more sensitive than
physical examination, which should be used to elicit the
pattern and delineate and clarify the problem.
The clinical examination should aim to answer three
questions. First, where is the anatomical site of the lesion or lesions? Second, is there anything to suggest
the underlying pathological process? Finally, what disability does the patient have as a consequence of their
neurological deficit?

The anatomical site of the lesion
From the moment you meet the patient, observe them
carefully. How does the patient shake your hand? Can
they lift their arm up? Can they let go of your hand
(myotonia)? Watch how they undress or get on to the
bed. A severe deficit will often become apparent before
you start the examination. Examine the area of interest
very carefully.

Fig. 26.2 should help you identify where the anatomical lesion is likely to be on the basis of the neurological
signs present.

The underlying cause
Once the site of the lesion is identified, think of the
differential diagnosis as outlined at the beginning of
this chapter. Are there any clues around the patient?
Look for diabetic drinks (for peripheral neuropathy or
amyotrophy).
If the patient is young, looks well and is sitting in a
wheelchair, consider MS as the most likely diagnosis.
An elderly patient with a hemiparesis is most likely to
have had a stroke – is there a blood pressure chart? Is
the patient in atrial fibrillation?
Look at the patient’s face for myotonic facies (myotonic dystrophy), Cushing’s syndrome (proximal myopathy) or hypothyroidism (myopathy or cerebellar
dysfunction). Does the patient have neurofibromatosis
(spinal cord or peripheral nerve lesions) or connective
tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (entrapment
mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex or peripheral neuropathy)?

158

The resultant disability
COMMUNICATION
Often the most important thing for the patient is what
the lesion prevents them from doing. Assess and
distinguish impairment, disability and handicap, and
address the problems accordingly.

It is important to distinguish three related concepts:
impairment refers to a problem of body function or
structure (e.g. right arm weakness following stroke);
disability refers to a particular activity (e.g. cannot
write); and handicap refers to social function (e.g. cannot work).
Think what tasks the affected part of the body normally performs and ask the patient to show you how
they manage, such as doing up buttons (for peripheral
neuropathy), brushing hair or standing up from a chair
(for proximal myopathy). Watching the patient walk is
an important part of the examination and can give
useful information (Fig. 26.3).

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH SENSORY AND/OR MOTOR
NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS
The pathway of investigation is very much determined
by the history and clinical examination findings. The
following tests may be useful but each patient will require only those relevant to their presentation.

Blood tests
• Full blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation
rate: reactive picture in inflammation, infection
and neoplasm, and raised MCV in vitamin B12 deficiency and alcohol abuse.
• Urea and electrolytes: raised urea and creatinine in
renal failure, potassium high or low in periodic
paralyses.
• Serum calcium: raised in hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, malignancy.
• Serum glucose: raised in DM.
• Liver function tests: raised gamma-GT in alcohol
abuse, raised alkaline phosphatase in Paget’s disease

•
•

and deranged transaminases in metastases, infection
and Wilson’s disease.
Thyroid function tests: hyper- or hypothyroidism.
Creatine kinase: markedly raised in muscle inflammation and muscular dystrophies.
Autoantibodies: in systemic disease, e.g. rheumatoid
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarteritis nodosa, and in many specific neurological
diseases – see Fig. 26.4.
Serology: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
herpes and syphilis where appropriate.
Immunoglobulins: paraproteinaemias.

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis
• A lumbar puncture is often required and many different tests can be performed on the CSF. These
are outlined in Fig. 26.5.

Imaging
• Plain radiographs may demonstrate degenerative
and destructive bone lesions and fractures.
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and
spine is extremely useful in diagnosing and localizing central lesions. It provides greater anatomical detail than CT and contrast can be given to show blood
vessels or areas of blood–brain barrier breakdown.
• Computed tomography (CT) scanning remains
useful in the acute setting, e.g. for detecting

haemorrhage, and also provides accurate imaging of
bony structures.
• Myelography can be useful in demonstrating compressive cord lesions but this technique has been
largely superseded by CT scans and MRI.

Further tests
• Electromyogram (EMG): useful in primary muscle
disease (typical changes in myotonia and myasthenia); it also shows denervation but not its cause.

160

• Nerve conduction studies demonstrate peripheral
neuropathies and the site and type of individual
nerve lesions.
• Evoked potentials: visual evoked potentials (VEP)
demonstrate previous retrobulbar neuritis in MS.
Auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials
may also be performed to look for lesions in these
pathways.
• Biopsy: consider if the diagnosis is in doubt despite
history, examination and non-invasive procedures.
Muscle, nerve and brain biopsies can be performed
to give a definitive histological diagnosis.

Vertigo and dizziness

27

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The importance of distinguishing true vertigo from dizziness or unsteadiness.
• The causes of vertigo resulting from pathology at various points of the neurological pathway, from the
inner ear to the brainstem.
• How to assess the patient with vertigo.
• How to approach the investigation of patients with vertigo.

INTRODUCTION
True vertigo is the illusion of movement, usually rotation but also swaying or tilting, of a patient or their surroundings. This is often accompanied by nausea,
vomiting and postural instability. It results from disease
either in the labyrinth (the most common cause), the
8th cranial nerve or its connections in the brainstem, including the cerebellum.
Dizziness or unsteadiness without vertigo can result
from a variety of unrelated disorders; these are discussed
in more detail in their appropriate chapters. It is important to bear in mind that occasionally patients with vestibular dysfunction will not complain of vertigo, and
that patients with presyncope occasionally complain
of a mild spinning sensation.

Dizziness
The differential diagnosis of dizziness is summarized in
Fig. 27.2.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
VERTIGO
The diagnosis in patients with vertigo is largely made on
the history. It is important to elicit the time course of the
vertigo and the likely site of the lesion by asking about
other auditory and neurological symptoms. Typical
features of specific diseases are shown in Fig. 27.3.

Onset and pattern of vertigo
The following should be established:

COMMUNICATION
When a patient presents with ‘vertigo’ or ‘dizziness’
it is vital to establish whether true vertigo is present or
not, as these symptoms result from different
pathologies.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN THE
PATIENT WITH VERTIGO OR
DIZZINESS

Vertigo
The differential diagnosis in the patient with vertigo includes labyrinth disorders, 8th cranial nerve disease or
brainstem lesions and is summarized in Fig. 27.1.
Rarely, vertigo can be a feature of temporal lobe pathology (e.g. temporal lobe epilepsy).

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00027-0

• Onset: peripheral lesions generally cause acute
severe symptoms; central lesions tend to cause a
gradual onset with less severe vertigo, unless caused
by ischaemia.
• Duration and recurrence: is it a single episode (e.g.
ischaemia or migrainous) or recurring (e.g. benign
positional vertigo)? Are the attacks brief (seconds
to minutes) or prolonged (hours to days)?
• Aggravating features: is there a relation to specific
positions or movements? Is it worse on coughing/
sneezing?

Aural symptoms
The presence of aural symptoms suggests that the lesion
is peripheral, involving the labyrinth or 8th cranial
nerve:
•
•
•
•

Deafness (fluctuating or progressive).
Tinnitus.
Ear discharge or pain.
A sensation of ear ‘fullness’ (Ménière’s disease).

Neurological symptoms
The following symptoms suggest central pathology or
acoustic neuroma:
• Other cranial nerve involvement: facial weakness, facial numbness, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia.
• Seizures.
• Weakness, altered sensation, limb ataxia.

History suggestive of an underlying
cause
• Recent viral illness may suggest vestibular neuronitis.
• Head injury may cause vertigo via a range of mechanisms such as labyrinth concussion or benign positional vertigo.
• Previous otological surgery.

162

• Drug history (e.g. aminoglycosides).
• Recent flying or diving (e.g. barotrauma – perilymphatic fistula).
• Associated headache with photophobia or phonophobia suggests migrainous vertigo.
• Past medical history: risk factors for vascular disease
(ischaemia), multiple sclerosis, migraine.
• Family history of vertigo: inherited episodic ataxia
(channelopathies).

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
VERTIGO
The clinical examination is often normal. The following
specific abnormalities should be looked for carefully:
• Nystagmus: observe the direction of slow and fast
phases, and whether they change direction or amplitude with direction of gaze. Are there features of a
peripheral or central cause (see Ch. 2)?
• Hallpike’s manoeuvre: the patient’s neck is extended
and head turned to one side; they are then asked to
lie down quickly with their head over the end of the
bed. In benign positional vertigo there will be a latent period of a few seconds followed by horizontal
and torsional nystagmus.
• Head thrust test: the patient is asked to fix their vision on a target; their head is then quickly turned
through 15 horizontally. It is positive if the eyes
are moved away from the point of fixation and
quickly corrected, and suggests a peripheral lesion.
• Focal neurological signs: if present, these suggest a
central lesion, acoustic neuroma or Ramsay Hunt
syndrome. Pay particular attention to assessment
of the 8th cranial nerve, gait and cerebellar signs.

• Ears: otoscopy may reveal otitis media or a herpetic
rash. Herpetic lesions may also be found on careful
examination of the surrounding skin.
• Lying and standing blood pressures: postural
hypotension.
• Neck movements: are they limited or do they provoke the symptoms? Rarely, cervical spondylosis
can cause ‘rotational vertebrobasilar ischaemia’ on
head-turning.
Fig. 27.4 summarizes the examination approach.

a cause. Similarly, routine blood tests may reveal
infection or evidence of other underlying disease.
Imaging: MRI should be performed if a central lesion
or acoustic neuroma is suspected. If posterior circulation infarction is suspected, this may need to be
performed urgently. See Fig. 27.5 for other indications.
Audiometry: this will help distinguish between conductive and sensorineural deafness.
Caloric tests: normally, running cold and then warm
water into the external auditory meatus causes nystagmus with the fast phase away and towards, respectively; where there is pathology in the
ipsilateral labyrinth, 8th cranial nerve or brainstem
this normal response will be reduced or absent.
Electronystagmography: a more accurate assessment
of the presence and type of nystagmus.

Excessive bruising and
bleeding

28

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The differential diagnosis of bruising and bleeding.
• The approach to assessing a patient presenting with bruising or bleeding.
• How to focus investigations to identify the precise cause of the bruising or bleeding.

INTRODUCTION
Excessive bruising and bleeding (prolonged, spontaneous or following an insignificant injury) arise when
there is abnormal haemostasis; this may occur due to
abnormalities of the coagulation pathway, abnormalities of platelet number or function or abnormalities
of the blood vessel (e.g. fragility of the vessel wall). This
chapter is intended to help with stable patients who
have a documented increased tendency to bleed and
is not about resuscitating the shocked patient.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF BRUISING AND BLEEDING

Platelet abnormalities
Platelets may be reduced in number or function.

Thrombocytopenia
• Reduced production: bone marrow failure, drugs
(commonly cytotoxics, quinine and co-trimoxazole), post chemotherapy or post radiotherapy, viral
infections (including HIV), hereditary syndromes.
• Increased consumption: immune thrombocytopenic
purpura (ITP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP), haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HIV-associated
and hyper-splenism.
• Abnormal distribution: splenic pooling in
splenomegaly.
• Dilutional: massive transfusion.
• Factitious: isolated thrombocytopenia may be related to aggregation caused by EDTA used in full
blood count bottles.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00028-2

Heparin is the most common drug-related cause of
thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients. There are
two types; the most common is a relatively benign,
non-immune form due to a direct effect on platelet activation. It usually resolves and does not need withdrawal
or future withholding of heparin. The less frequent, immune mediated form has the potentially serious sequelae
of arterial and venous thrombosis.

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a
procoagulant state.

Platelet dysfunction
• Hereditary: Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelet
surface).
• Acquired: aspirin, heparin, thienopyridines (e.g.
clopidogrel), dipyridamole, uraemia.
• Myeloproliferative disease and paraproteinaemia.

Coagulation abnormalities
Coagulopathies may be due to vitamin K deficiency, factor deficiency (which can be specific or combined,
inherited or acquired) or acquired clotting factor inhibitors.

Vitamin K deficiency
Factors II, VII, IX and X are dependent on vitamin K.
Deficiency may be caused by:
• Malabsorption: bowel pathology such as coeliac disease or biliary obstruction (vitamin K is fat-soluble).
• Antagonist drugs: coumarins (warfarin).

165

Excessive bruising and bleeding

Factor deficiency
• Hereditary: haemophilia A (factor VIII), haemophilia B (factor IX), von Willebrand’s disease (von
Willebrand factor).
• Acquired: liver disease (decreased production of
clotting factors as synthetic function fails), DIC
(massive consumption of clotting factors resulting
in deficiency).

Acquired factor inhibitors
These are most commonly directed against factor VIII:
• Postpartum.
• Autoimmune disease: SLE and rheumatoid arthritis.
• Malignancy.

Vessel wall abnormalities

• Vessel wall abnormalities cause petechiae and ecchymoses due to bleeding from small vessels, usually in
the skin but also in mucous membranes.
• Coagulopathies cause haemarthroses, muscle haematomas, postoperative or traumatic bleeding and palpable ecchymoses, and if inherited start early in life.
COMMUNICATION
Abnormal bruising or bleeding can be a very alarming
initial presentation. It is important to ask the patient
about specific concerns they may have, for example
that the condition might signal leukaemia or other
malignancy. For patients with hereditary haemophilia
bruising and bleeding are common symptoms and they
often know more about their condition than the nonspecialist doctor. Each patient should be counselled
according to their individual needs.

Vessel wall abnormalities may be inherited or acquired.

Hereditary

What is the underlying cause?

• Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler–
Weber–Rendu disease).
• Connective tissue disease: pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

• Bleeding and bruising: first, determine whether it is
within the spectrum of ‘normal’ and related to recent
trauma, or possibly due to an underlying haemostatic abnormality.
• Age: senile purpura seen mostly on the upper limbs.
• Liver disease: intrinsic liver disease (coagulopathy)
or biliary obstruction (may cause reduced platelet
function and vitamin K deficiency).
• Drug history: aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin,
steroids, previous chemotherapy.
• Family history (e.g. haemophilia, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia).
• Symptoms of underlying bone marrow failure (e.g.
recurrent infection, symptoms of anaemia).
• Hyperextensibility of the skin or joints: Ehlers–
Danlos syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum.
• Poor diet: scurvy (ecchymoses predominantly on the
lower limbs).
• Known acquired immune deficiency syndrome or
risk factors for HIV infection.

Trauma.
Physiological: senile purpura.
Drugs: corticosteroids.
Infections: meningococcal septicaemia (damage due
to endotoxin and inflammation).
• Vitamin deficiency: scurvy (vitamin C).
• Endocrine: Cushing’s syndrome.

HISTORY IN THE PATIENT WITH
BRUISING AND BLEEDING
The history should focus on three areas. First, what is the
pattern and extent of the bleeding and bruising? Second,
are there any clues as to the possible underlying cause?
Finally, have complications occurred?

What is the pattern and extent of
bleeding and bruising?
As a general rule:
• Platelet abnormalities (deficiency or dysfunction)
cause skin or mucosal purpura and haemorrhage,
with prolonged bleeding following trauma or often
minor surgery. Most cases of von Willebrand’s disease also follow this pattern.

166

HINTS AND TIPS
Von Willebrand factor is necessary for platelet adhesion
and prevents factor VIII from degradation; vWf
deficiency may therefore cause bleeding consistent
with both platelet abnormalities and coagulopathy.

Have complications occurred?
• Evaluate the severity of the bleeding: was it lifethreatening or a minor irritant?

28

Investigating the patient with bruising and bleeding

Are there signs suggestive of a
specific underlying cause?

• Symptoms of anaemia (see Ch. 29).
• Muscle pain or mass.
• Joint pain or deformity.

EXAMINING THE PATIENT WITH
BRUISING AND BLEEDING
The examination should be approached in a similar
manner to the history. Fig. 28.1 summarizes the examination approach.

What is the pattern and extent
of bruising and bleeding?
The sites and types of lesions should be documented (see
above). ‘Petechiae’ usually denotes small, pinpoint bleeding into skin or mucosa; ‘purpura’ denotes small bruises;
and ‘ecchymosis’ refers to anything larger than 1–2 cm.

Eyes
— Conjunctival pallor
Lymph nodes
— Lymphadenopathy

Joints
— Deformity
— Hyperextensibility
— Haemarthrosis

• Signs of liver disease (see Ch. 13) or immune
deficiency.
• Splenomegaly (of any cause): platelet sequestration.
• Cushingoid appearance and fragile skin: steroid
therapy, endocrinopathy.
• Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: characteristic petechiae on the tongue and lips.
• Scurvy: corkscrew hairs with hyperkeratosis of the
follicles, perifollicular haemorrhages, gum hypertrophy, poor wound healing.
• Ehlers–Danlos syndrome: hyperextensible skin and
joints, ‘fish-mouth’ wounds due to slow healing,
and pseudotumours under scars and over bony
prominences.
• Pseudoxanthoma elasticum: loose skin in neck, axillae, antecubital fossae and groins, ‘chicken skin’, blue
sclera, angioid streaks in the retina, hyperextensible
joints.

How severe has the bleeding been
and are there complications?
Look for evidence of anaemia, which may be due to
chronic bleeding or an acute haemorrhage (see
Ch. 29). Finally, look for joint deformities (haemarthrosis) or a muscle mass (haematoma).

INVESTIGATING THE PATIENT
WITH BRUISING AND BLEEDING
When an abnormality of haemostasis is suspected, a
platelet count and simple coagulation assays should
be performed; more specific tests to diagnose the underlying cause can then be considered. Fig. 28.2 summarizes the normal coagulation pathway.
An algorithm for investigating the patient with bruising and bleeding is given in Fig. 28.3; the common tests
are summarized in Fig. 28.4.

• Platelet count: if thrombocytopenia is present, request a blood film to exclude an artefactual result
due to platelet clumping and to look for a primary
haematological cause. A bone marrow aspirate
should be performed (see below).
• Other indices: haemoglobin level may give an indication of severity of bleeding, and an abnormal

reassessed; correction of the test implies a deficiency,
whereas continued prolongation implies the presence of an inhibitor. Further tests, e.g. the dilute
Russell viper venom test, can be employed to look
for inhibitors, e.g. a lupus anticoagulant.

Coagulation studies
• Prothrombin time: this measures the extrinsic system (tissue factor and VII) and common pathway
(X, V, prothrombin and fibrinogen). It is prolonged
in liver disease and warfarin therapy, and is generally
expressed as international normalized ratio (INR).
• Activated partial thromboplastin time: this measures
the intrinsic system (XII, XI, IX and VIII) and common pathway (X, V, prothrombin and fibrinogen).
It is prolonged in unfractionated heparin therapy
(not newer low-molecular-weight heparins), factor
deficiency such as factor VIII (haemophilia A) and
factor IX (haemophilia B, Christmas disease), acquired factor inhibition and the presence of a lupus
anticoagulant.
• Thrombin time: this measures the activity of thrombin and fibrinogen in the common pathway. It is
prolonged in fibrinogen deficiency (disseminated
intravascular coagulation) or dysfunction. Prolonged thrombin time may also result from heparin
therapy (inhibition of thrombin activity).
• Mixing studies: if the above tests are prolonged, the
sample can be mixed 1:1 with normal serum and

168

Platelet function studies
• Platelet function assay (PFA-100 analyser): this is
performed using a laboratory analyser that measures
platelet adhesion and aggregation with greater sensitivity and specificity than bleeding time. It is useful
in the diagnosis of von Willebrand’s disease and
other inherited disorders of platelet function, and
can discriminate between aspirin/NSAID-induced
dysfunction and other causes. It returns a parameter
called ‘closure time’.
• Bleeding time: this is now rarely performed.

Fibrinogen, fibrin degradation
products and D-dimers
• Fibrinogen: inherited disorders of fibrinogen are rare
and may cause reduced levels or complete lack of
fibrinogen. Fibrinogen levels are low in DIC (due
to massive consumption) and may be reduced in
liver disease (reduced synthesis).

Bear in mind that normal range results in many tests do
not exclude a bleeding disorder. There are increasing
numbers of sophisticated tests of platelet function and
coagulation that are beyond the scope of this book.
Referral to a haematologist specializing in haemostasis
is recommended.

Anaemia

29

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The classification and causes of anaemia.
• How to assess a patient presenting with anaemia.
• The investigations required to determine the likely cause of anaemia.

INTRODUCTION
Anaemia is not a diagnosis but a consequence of an
underlying problem. A patient is anaemic when the
haemoglobin concentration in the blood is less than
13.5 g/dL in men and 11.5 g/dL in women. Anaemia
is common, as up to 10% of women in the UK are
iron-deficient as a result of menorrhagia.

Macrocytic red blood cells
Macrocytic RBCs have an MCV of more than 95 fL.
Causes include:
• Megaloblastic anaemia: folate deficiency (Fig. 29.3),
vitamin B12 deficiency (Fig. 29.4).
• Normoblastic anaemia: alcohol, liver disease, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, reticulocytosis.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF
ANAEMIA
The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the red blood
cells gives important clues to the likely underlying cause
of the anaemia.

Microcytic red blood cells
Microcytic red blood cells (RBCs) have an MCV of less
than 80 femtolitres (fL). Causes include:
•
•
•
•
•

Iron-deficiency anaemia (Fig. 29.1).
Thalassaemia.
Anaemia of chronic disease (see Ch. 37).
Sideroblastic anaemia.
Lead poisoning.

Normocytic red blood cells
Normocytic RBCs have a MCV of 80–95 fL. Causes
include:
• Anaemia of chronic disease (see Ch. 37).
• Haemolysis (Fig. 29.2); may also lead to a mild
macrocytosis.
• Acute blood loss.
• Bone marrow hypoplasia.
• Myelodysplastic syndrome.

HISTORY IN THE ANAEMIC
PATIENT
It is important to establish the severity of any symptoms
caused by the anaemia. The history should then focus
on whether any complications of anaemia are present
and whether there are any clues as to the likely underlying diagnosis.

Symptoms of anaemia
When anaemia develops over a long time, the haemoglobin can be very low before symptoms occur. Anaemia is
tolerated less well in the elderly. The following symptoms
may be reported:
•
•
•
•
•

Lethargy and fatigue.
Shortness of breath: most marked on exertion.
Light-headedness.
Palpitations.
Pulsatile tinnitus.

Symptoms of complications
• Symptoms of cardiac failure (see Chs 4 and 5).
• Angina.
• Ischaemic claudication.

Vitamin B12 is presents in all foods of animal origin.

Evidence to suggest underlying
cause
• Specific symptoms: menorrhagia, change in bowel
habit, dyspepsia, weight loss, change in stool or
urine colour.
• Pre-existing illness: chronic inflammatory disease
(e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), previous abdominal surgery, chronic renal failure.
• Family history: haemolytic anaemia.
• Drug history: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
steroids, anticoagulants (iron deficiency), anticonvulsants (folate deficiency).

Examining the anaemic patient
• Diet: vegans (vitamin B12 deficiency), alcoholics
(folate deficiency).
• Pica (craving for specific and often bizarre foods):
iron deficiency.
• Pregnancy: folate deficiency.

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that the rate of drop in haemoglobin is as
important as the level; if blood loss is chronic, very low
levels can be tolerated with only mild symptoms
occurring. If acute, a fall of just 2 g/dL can cause
significant symptoms.

Signs of anaemia and its
complications

following signs of anaemia should be noted:
• Pallor: mucous membranes (mouth and conjunctivae), nails, skin creases.
• Hyperdynamic circulation: tachycardia, collapsing
pulse (due to increased stroke volume causing wide
pulse pressure), systolic flow murmur.
• Cardiac failure.

Anaemia

Evidence of underlying disease
A full general examination should always be performed,
including breast examination and rectal examination in
iron deficiency. Specific abnormalities include the
following:

COMMUNICATION
Iron-deficiency anaemia may be a sinister finding in
older adults and always needs an explanation. A careful
dietary and medical history should be taken to try
and identify an underlying cause.

• Glossitis: megaloblastic anaemia, iron deficiency.
• Angular stomatitis and koilonychia: iron deficiency,
folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency.
• Jaundice: haemolysis, megaloblastic anaemia (mild).
• Splenomegaly: haemolysis, megaloblastic anaemia,
marrow infiltration and hypoplasia (see Ch. 25).
• Leg ulcers: rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease.
• Bone deformities: thalassaemia.
• Peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, subacute combined degeneration of the cord and dementia are all
neurological sequelae of vitamin B12 deficiency.
• Blue line on the gums (Burton’s lines), peripheral
motor neuropathy and encephalopathy are seen in
lead poisoning.
• Haemosiderin deposition in the skin may be evidence of multiple transfusions.

Reticulocytes are immature erythrocytes that normally
constitute only 0.5–2.0% of circulating RBCs. The reticulocyte count and percentage rises if RBC production
and release increases in response to peripheral loss or
breakdown. This occurs following haemorrhage, in
acute or chronic haemolysis, or during vitamin B12,
folate or iron replacement therapy for anaemia caused
by deficiency.

Note the racial origin of the patient as thalassaemia is
more common in people from the Mediterranean to
south-east Asia, while sickle cell anaemia is more common among people of Black African origin.

Haematinics

INVESTIGATING THE ANAEMIC
PATIENT

General blood tests

Reticulocyte count

Blood film
The blood film is mandatory and can provide diagnostic
information, as shown in Fig. 29.6.

A request can often be made to a haematology lab to
perform ‘haematinics’ and this usually includes ferritin
(the iron storage protein and best non-invasive estimate
of iron stores), folate and vitamin B12. All these tests
should be performed as deficiencies often coexist. Levels
cannot be reliably interpreted following blood
transfusion.

Full blood count

Other tests

• Haemoglobin: severity of anaemia.
• Mean corpuscular volume (80–95 fL): underlying
pathologies.
• White cell count (4.0–11.0  109/L): if low, consider
bone marrow failure; if high, consider infection,
inflammation or malignancy.
• Platelet count (150–400  109/L): if low, consider
bone marrow failure; if high, consider infection,
inflammation or malignancy.
• Red cell distribution width (RDW): this is a measure
of the spread of the MCV. In a mixed population of
microcytic and macrocytic red cells (anisocytosis),
the overall MCV may still be normal, but the RDW
will be raised.

• Tissue transglutaminase to look for malabsorption
due to coeliac disease.
• Thyroid function tests.

Specific blood tests
HINTS AND TIPS
Ferritin is an acute phase protein, so falsely elevated or
normal results may occur with inflammation.

An algorithm is presented in Fig. 29.7 to outline the
diagnosis of anaemia.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
and plasma viscosity (PV)

Iron deficiency

The ESR and PV will be raised in infection, inflammation or malignancy.

conditions.

Features of iron deficiency and

present

• Schilling test (now rarely performed): the patient is
given a loading dose of 1000 mg vitamin B12 intramuscularly followed by a small oral dose of radioactive vitamin B12, and absorption is estimated by
measuring the vitamin B12 excreted in the urine. Intrinsic factor is then given if malabsorption is present; in pernicious anaemia this will correct the
malabsorption, but it will persist despite the use of
intrinsic factor in intestinal disease.
HINTS AND TIPS
Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a profound
pancytopenia in addition to anaemia.

Folate deficiency
• RBC or serum folate: low.
• Bilirubin and LDH: mildly raised – intramedullary
destruction of abnormal RBCs.
• Further tests for intestinal malabsorption may be
necessary (see below).

Haemolysis
•
•
•
•
•
•

RBC, red blood cell.

•
• Serum ferritin: low in iron deficiency but raised in
iron overload, haemochromatosis and anaemia of
chronic disease (occasionally).
• Serum iron: low, though this is less sensitive than
other measures.
• Total iron-binding capacity: increased.
• Transferrin saturation (serum iron/total ironbinding capacity): <15%.

Vitamin B12 deficiency
• Serum vitamin B12: low.
• Bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): may be
mildly raised due to intramedullary destruction of
abnormal RBCs.
• Gastric parietal cell antibodies: positive in 80% of
patients with pernicious anaemia.
• Intrinsic factor antibodies: positive in approximately
50% of patients with pernicious anaemia.

29

•
•

•

Serum bilirubin: raised and unconjugated.
Serum haptoglobins: reduced or absent.
LDH: raised.
Stercobilinogen (faecal) and urobilinogen (urinary):
raised.
Reticulocyte count: raised.
Haemoglobin electrophoresis: abnormal in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease.
Direct antigen test (Coombs’ test): positive in
immune-mediated haemolytic anaemias (autoimmune, drug-induced or alloimmune haemolytic
disease of the newborn).
Osmotic fragility: increased if spherocytes are
present.
Enzyme assays: available in specialist centres only
for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase deficiencies.
Ham’s (acid haemolysis) test: positive in paroxysmal
nocturnal haemoglobinuria. Ham’s test is an examination favourite but increasingly rare in clinical
practice.

Anaemia of chronic disease
• Ferritin: often high (ferritin is an acute phase
protein).
• Serum iron: low.
• Total iron-binding capacity: low.
• Serum vitamin B12: normal.
• RBC/serum folate: normal.

The clinical scenario should direct other investigations.
Consider erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive

for occult malignancy.
HINTS AND TIPS
Mixed deficiency can cause a normocytic anaemia:
in these cases remember to check the RDW and request
a blood film.

176

Further tests
There may be a clear cause, for instance menorrhagia or
pregnancy in iron deficiency, meaning that further tests
are not necessary. However, further investigation is often required.

Bone marrow
• Not necessary when the diagnosis is obvious (e.g.
iron deficiency).

Investigating the anaemic patient
• Bone marrow aspirate gives information regarding
the development and proportion of different cell
lines, infiltration by abnormal cells (e.g. blast cells
or metastatic carcinoma) and the presence of iron
stores. Samples can be used for cytogenetics.
• Bone marrow trephine biopsy provides structural information regarding bone marrow architecture, overall cellularity and accurate assessment of infiltration.

Gastrointestinal investigations
• Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy
should always be considered in iron deficiency.

29

Coeliac disease is a common cause of iron deficiency
and duodenal biopsy often shows characteristic
changes.
• If no cause of iron deficiency is found, consider
capsule endoscopy to look for angiodysplasia. If
bleeding is acute, a mesenteric angiogram may be
helpful.
• Tests looking for causes of malabsorption may be
necessary, such as contrast studies (barium or watersoluble contrast), colonoscopy and terminal ileal
biopsy, enteroscopy and jejunal biopsy. Capsule
endoscopy may be useful.

The key learning points for this chapter:
• Know the most important risk factors for ischaemic heart disease.
• Describe differences between the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
• Know the drugs used for a patient with stable angina in an outpatient clinic.
• Describe the ECG characteristics of arrhythmias.
• Describe the action of drugs that improve survival in systolic heart failure.
• Understand how drugs are combined in the treatment of hypertension.
• Describe the clinical findings of common heart valve lesions.
• Describe the usual presentations of infective endocarditis.

ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE

Introduction
Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is the result of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
The term covers a group of clinical syndromes, including
chronic angina pectoris and the acute coronary syndromes (ACS), which include ‘unstable angina’, non-STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
The commonest underlying pathology is atherosclerosis
of the coronary arteries. More rarely, IHD can result from
coronary artery spasm, emboli, coronary ostial stenosis,
aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias causing decreased coronary perfusion
pressures, and anaemia. Cardiac ischaemia in the presence
of normal coronary arteries is termed cardiac syndrome X.
It is thought to be due to abnormalities of small coronary
vessels resulting in a reduction of coronary flow reserve
and is therefore also referred to as microvascular angina.
The prevalence of IHD shows gross geographical variation, reflecting both genetic and lifestyle factors. In the
UK it is estimated 6.5% of men and 4% of women suffer
with IHD. Prevalence is highly age dependent; less than
0.5% of the population under the age of 40 has IHD,
yet greater than 25% of those over 75 suffer with IHD.

The complete list of possible risk factors for IHD is
extremely long and includes environmental factors as
well as personal characteristics. Not all these factors will
ultimately be shown to be truly causal. For example,
obesity may act as a risk factor because it is associated
with raised serum cholesterol, hypertension and decreased glucose tolerance. Typically, risk factors are
divided into modifiable and non-modifiable.

Non-modifiable risk factors
Age
As discussed in the introduction the prevalence of IHD
rises steeply with increasing age. This may be due to the
cumulative effects of raised serum cholesterol, hypertension, cigarette smoking and other factors over time.

Sex
The rate in young men is about six times higher than in
women of the same age, although this difference diminishes with increasing age. Premenopausal women are
thought to be protected by their hormonal status, and
this protection diminishes progressively during and
after the menopause such that the ratio of IHD in
men and women aged 70 years is equal.

Family history

Risk factors for ischaemic heart
disease
A number of predictors have been found to be associated with an increased likelihood of developing IHD
and are called risk factors (Fig. 30.1).

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00030-0

The effect of family history appears to be independent of
other major risk factors if first-degree relatives below the
age of 50 years are affected. Although high levels of serum total cholesterol may cluster in families, only a very
small proportion of these are associated with the genetic
condition ‘familial hypercholesterolaemia’.

Race
The prevalence of IHD in British Asians is high compared with their family members remaining in the
Indian subcontinent. The explanation is only partly
accounted for by low HDL cholesterol and a higher
prevalence of DM and glucose intolerance.

Modifiable risk factors
Smoking
The risk of developing coronary artery disease is directly
proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked. The
rate of IHD in current smokers is about three times that
of those who have never smoked. Giving up smoking
leads to an initial rapid decrease in the risk of developing IHD, followed by a more gradual decline in risk; the
risk of IHD is almost the same as a non-smoker after approximately 10 years.
HINTS AND TIPS
The description of symptoms in ischaemic heart disease
is very variable. Patients often use words such as
heaviness, tightness or restriction rather than pain.

Blood lipid profile
The risk of IHD increases as serum total cholesterol and
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increases.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is ‘protective’ for IHD, and the risk of IHD decreases as HDL increases. Triglycerides are also positively related to IHD
risk, although, when the relationship of IHD to other
blood lipids is taken into account, the independent contribution of triglycerides to IHD may be small.

Hypertension
Both systolic and diastolic hypertension are associated
with the risk of developing IHD, as well as hypertensive
heart disease, stroke and renal failure. Treatment of hypertension with drugs reduces the incidence of cardiac
events, particularly in the elderly.

180

Diabetes mellitus
In countries where IHD is prevalent, diabetes mellitus
(DM) is associated with an approximately threefold increase in the risk of a major IHD event.

Weight
Overweight individuals have twice the risk of a major
IHD event. This is probably mediated through increased
blood pressure levels, total cholesterol, insulin resistance and with decreased HDL and physical activity.

Obstructive sleep apnoea
Although associated with obesity and hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea appears to have an independent
association with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
disease.

Novel risk factors
In recent years, newer risk factors have been suggested;
these include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and
hyperfibrinogenaemia plus hyperhomocysteinaemia.
Whether these are truly independent risk factors or
markers of underlying inflammation should become
clear from further studies.

Psychosocial factors
Although stress and other strong emotional responses
can precipitate major IHD events in individuals with severe atherosclerosis, it remains to be shown whether
stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery
disease in the absence of other standard risk factors.
Combining risk factors is a more accurate way of predicting those at risk from IHD than relying on any one
individual risk factor. Many models and scoring systems
have been devised incorporating the different risk factors so that those at high risk may be targeted for preventative treatment. The commonly used cardiovascular
risk prediction charts can be found at the back of the
British National Formulary. They are an aid to decision
making but should not replace clinical judgement. In
addition, this should be accompanied by populationbased measures to reduce the risk of IHD.

Pathophysiology
Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressive focal proliferation of connective tissue within the arterial intima that
begins as early as the second decade of life. It is linked to
high lipid levels. LDL is the main atherogenic lipid, although the principal constituent of atherosclerotic plaques is collagen synthesized by smooth muscle cells.
The initial process consists of endothelial dysfunction in association with a high circulating cholesterol,
inflammation and shear forces. Macrophages enter the
arterial wall between endothelial cells, taking up lipids
and forming ‘foam cells’. The accumulation of lipidladen macrophages in the subendothelial zone leads

Ischaemic heart disease
to the formation of fatty streaks. Toxic products released
from the macrophages lead to the adhesion of platelets
and result in smooth muscle cell proliferation and
thrombus formation. This then becomes organized,
leading to the development of an atherosclerotic plaque
surrounded by a fibrotic cap. Progressive enlargement
of these lesions leads to segmental narrowing of the lumen, which, when sufficient to be flow-limiting on exercise, causes stable exertion-associated angina.
Atherosclerotic plaques are liable to rupture, resulting in sudden thrombosis, which is responsible for
acute coronary syndromes. Factors associated with plaque disruption and consequent thrombosis include a
large lipid core, a high monocyte density and low
smooth muscle cell density.
The association of high levels of CRP and other inflammatory markers with IHD has led many to suggest
that atherosclerosis may be an inflammatory process.
Various pathogens have been advanced, including Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia pneumoniae, although this
remains speculative.

Clinical features
Ischaemic heart disease clinically presents in broadly
two categories: chronic ‘stable’ angina and acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Stable angina is due to a ‘predictable’ mismatch between oxygen supply and
demand of cardiac myocytes – cardiac ischaemia. This
is brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. Symptoms are central chest pain, heaviness or discomfort
commonly radiating to the jaw or arm and may be associated with shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or
faintness (see Ch. 4). ACS presents with the same symptoms but, unlike stable angina, occurs suddenly and is
often a result of athrosclerotic plaque rupture.

30

Electrocardiogram
A normal ECG does not exclude a diagnosis of stable angina or ACS. During attacks, there may be ST-segment
depression or symmetrical T wave inversion. T wave inversion in leads V1–V3 often indicates left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis. The ECG may show
signs of an old myocardial infarction (MI) or left ventricular hypertrophy. Comparison with an old ECG is
very useful (and therefore doing a routine ECG for anyone attending A&E over the age of 60 is a good idea).

Exercise electrocardiogram
In IHD the exercise ECG is an indicator of exercise performance and is an independent indicator of prognosis.
It is contraindicated in ACS, severe aortic stenosis, severe pulmonary hypertension and significant rhythm
disturbances. The test is usually regarded as positive if
there is more than 1 mm of downsloping ST-segment
depression after the J point (the junction of the ST
segment and the T wave). If the pre-test probability of
angina is high, the number of false positives is low.
Causes of false-positive tests include hyperventilation,
digoxin, hypokalaemia, hypertension, valvular heart
disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and pre-excitation
syndromes. The test should be terminated if there is
more than 3 mm of ST depression, a fall in blood pressure, ventricular tachycardia, pallor, indicating peripheral circulatory collapse or if the end point is reached.

Echocardiography

Although stable angina and ACS present with similar
symptoms they are investigated differently. ACS is a
medical emergency and requires urgent inpatient diagnosis which guides management (see later). Stable angina is commonly managed in primary care with
diagnostic investigations arranged as an outpatient.

This can be used to assess ventricular function and localize areas of ventricular wall involvement. In patients
with angina but no evidence of infarction, the echocardiogram may be normal. With diffuse ischaemic
changes, left ventricular function may be globally impaired. Exercise or pharmacological stress echocardiography may be used to detect areas of ‘hibernating’
myocardium. These are areas that show reduced function with exercise, due to decreased blood flow secondary to decreased coronary flow reserve, but which show
improved function at rest. They indicate areas that may
improve with revascularization procedures.

Assessment of risk factors

CT coronary angiography

The risk factors for IHD have been summarized above.
All modifiable risk factors should be addressed as part of
investigating patients with suspected IHD. Baseline
blood pressure measurement, lipid profile and glucose
levels should be performed. If the patient is a smoker,
smoking cessation advice should be provided.

Recent advances in computed tomography technology
have allowed for non-invasive assessment of the coronary arteries. CT scans can be used in stratifying IHD
risk through a ‘calcium score’ – a proven indicator for
atherosclerosis, or as a non-invasive method for assessing coronary artery patency.

Investigations

181

Cardiovascular system

Nuclear imaging
This technique may be used to assess myocardial structure and function. A radioactive isotope (e.g. thallium,
technetium (MIBI or MUGA scan)) is injected during exercise and an image is taken soon after. The isotope is
taken up by healthy myocardium whereas areas of infarction show up as ‘cold spots’. If exercise is not feasible, pharmacological stress can be induced with agents
such as adenosine. Repeat images are taken at rest to obtain a redistribution image. The disappearance of the
cold spot implies ischaemia provoked by exertion and
reversed by rest; a fixed cold spot indicates infarction.
It is a useful technique when the exercise test is equivocal or contraindicated, or to indicate the clinical significance of angiographically equivocal stenoses.

Coronary angiography
This is a technique for visualizing the coronary arteries radiographically, measuring intracardiac pressures, blood
oxygen saturation in different cardiac chambers and cardiac output. The test is usually used to determine the exact
coronary anatomy and to decide on further management
(i.e. medical therapy, coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery). In stable angina, it is usually reserved
for patients with:
• Angina resistant to optimal medical treatment.
• Strongly positive exercise tests indicating a poor
prognosis.
• Evidence of reversible ischaemia on stress testing
with reduced left ventricular function.
• After confirmed troponin-positive acute coronary
events, especially if pain continues.
More rarely, coronary angiography is used as a diagnostic test when other non-invasive tests have not been
helpful and symptoms persist.
The mortality from the procedure is approximately 1
in 1000. Complications include:
• Haemorrhage and haematoma at the site of arterial
puncture.
• Emboli into arteries resulting in coronary or peripheral ischaemia.
• Stroke.
• Arrhythmias.
• Coronary artery dissection.

Treatment of ischaemic heart
disease
Chronic stable angina provides considerable morbidity
for patients and a high workload for health services.
Similar to all chronic disease, the optimal management
comprises patient education, lifestyle change and medication. Non-coronary causes for angina should be

182

sought and treated (e.g. valvular heart disease and anaemia). NICE guidelines are now available for the management of stable angina (July 2011), unstable angina
and NSTEMI (March 2010) and chest pain of recent onset (March 2010). Guidance on STEMI is due to be published in July 2013.

General measures
Risk factors should be sought and addressed. Weight
loss, smoking cessation, exercise within the capacity
of the patient and healthy diet should all be encouraged.
Exercise may improve the collateral circulation in the
heart in the same way as in peripheral vascular disease.
Factors precipitating angina (e.g. cold weather or extremes of emotion) should be avoided. All patients
should be provided with a sublingual nitrate, either
spray or tablet, for relief of acute attacks or prophylactic
use before exercise.

Pharmacological management
Antiplatelet drugs
All patients should be prescribed aspirin 75 mg daily as
this lowers the incidence of subsequent MI and death.
There is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding so patients
should be given advice to take the aspirin with food
and made aware of warning signs such as melaena; if a
history of previous bleeding is present, a proton pump
inhibitor can be added. If aspirin is contraindicated, then
clopidogrel, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, is an alternative. Furthermore, clopidogrel has recently come off
licence and its use is likely to increase in the coming
years, potentially instead of aspirin, to treat pathologies
where atherosclerosis is the underlying disease process.

Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers improve oxygen supply and demand balance by lowering heart rate and blood pressure, decreasing end systolic stress and contractility and prolonging
diastole, permitting more coronary flow. Beta-blockers
are the first-line drug in preventing symptoms and
meta-analyses have shown they improve mortality.
Typical beta-blockers include atenolol, bisoprolol
and metoprolol. Relative contraindications include
asthma and peripheral vascular disease with skin ulceration. They are contraindicated in second- and thirddegree heart block.

Nitrates
Nitrates cause peripheral vasodilatation, especially in the
veins. This reduces venous return and ventricular preload
is decreased. Reduction in the distension of the heart wall
decreases oxygen demand, resulting in relief of angina.
Nitrates work by conversion to nitric oxide, which results
in an increase in intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in smooth muscle. This stimulates

30

Acute coronary syndromes
calcium-binding processes and the free calcium available
to trigger muscle contraction is reduced.
Short-acting nitrates are the mainstay of relief of acute
angina and, when combined with rest, they relieve the
pain in minutes. If it continues, then this should be a
warning sign to patients. Longer-acting nitrates are more
stable and can be effective for several hours. Isosorbide
dinitrate (ISDN) is rapidly metabolized by the liver to
mononitrate, which is the main active metabolite. Isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) may avoid the variable absorption and unpredictable first-pass metabolism of the
dinitrate.
Adverse effects are normally due to arterial dilatation
and include headaches, flushing, hypotension and
rarely fainting. Patients may become tolerant to nitrates,
reducing their effectiveness. Nitrate ‘holidays’ are the
traditional way of minimizing the problem, although
newer once-daily preparations reduce this effect.

Calcium channel blockers
Calcium antagonists inhibit the influx of calcium into
the myocyte during the action potential and relax peripheral vascular smooth muscle. They reduce angina by a
combination of reduced afterload and hence myocardial
oxygen demand plus reduced heart rate and increased
coronary vasodilation. They are especially useful if there
is a degree of coronary artery spasm. Dihydropyridines
such as nifedipine can cause reflex tachycardia secondary
to peripheral vasodilatation and therefore may be combined with a beta-blocker. Diltiazem has slight negative
inotropic and chronotropic effects, and the patient
should be monitored if on beta-blockers for the development of bradycardias. Verapamil is the drug of choice for
supraventricular tachycardias if beta-blockers are contraindicated (verapamil and beta-blockers must never be
coprescribed). All calcium channel blocking drugs are
negatively inotropic to some degree and, although amlodipine has demonstrated its safety in heart failure, extreme care should be taken with prescribing any of
them to patients with impaired left ventricular function.
Side effects include headache, flushing, dizziness,
constipation and gravitational oedema.

Potassium channel activators
Nicorandil has arterial and venous vasodilating properties and is useful in patients refractory to treatment with
other antianginal agents.

ACE inhibitors
Patients with stable angina and proven left ventricular
dysfunction should be on an ACE inhibitor unless contraindicated. The benefit of ACE inhibitors in stable angina with normal ventricular function is controversial
and several large RCTs have been contradictive.

Lipid-lowering drugs
Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy. The current maxim is
‘the lower the better’. Statins may also help to stabilize
atherosclerotic plaques and reduce the frequency of
acute cardiac events. Most patients with IHD should
be on a statin even if their cholesterol is within the normal range.

Angioplasty and stenting
After plaque visualization at angiography, coronary
artery stenoses can be dilated using a balloon to improve
perfusion. The best results in terms of patency and flow
are achieved with stent insertion. This is a very safe procedure and is now preferred to surgery in most cases. Use
of clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists has further reduced stent re-stenosis. Drug-eluting
stents (e.g. with sirolimus) may further enhance this,
although trials are still ongoing. Patients need only stay
in hospital overnight and they return to activity quickly
compared to surgery.

Surgical management
Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery should be
considered in patients who have angina despite optimal
medical therapy and are not suitable for, or have failed,
angioplasty. It has a low mortality in otherwise well patients (2%). Bypass using one or both of the internal
mammary arteries is preferred to the traditional vein
graft. They result in better patency, flow and graft survival. Certain patient groups are better served by surgery
rather than stents (Fig. 30.2). Postoperatively, the number and dose of antianginal drugs can be reduced.

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES
The terminology used to classify acute cardiac ischaemic
events has changed in the last few years. Subendocardial
and non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions (MI) are now
termed non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI). Acute
MI with ST-segment elevation is hence an STEMI. This
reflects the fact that the key to appropriate treatment

mortality with coronary artery bypass surgery.

Cardiovascular system
is the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation because there are good evidence-based guidelines for their
different management. When combined with unstable
angina, all three are the ‘acute coronary syndromes’
(ACS). ACS is common (incidence 15/1000): of these
roughly one-third will present with an NSTEMI;
one-third with an STEMI; and one-third with unstable
angina. Prognostic scoring systems have been validated
and will be discussed later in this section.

ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(STEMI)
Myocardial infarction affects 5 in 1000 of the general
population per year in the UK and is the most common
cause of mortality in the Western world. Ninety percent
of transmural MIs are caused by an occlusive intracoronary thrombus overlying an ulcerated or fissured stenotic
plaque. Underlying most cases there is a dynamic interaction between severe coronary atherosclerosis, an acute
atheromatous plaque change, superimposed thrombosis, platelet activation and vasospasm. The microscopic
changes of acute MI follow a predictable sequence
(Fig. 30.3).
The overall fatality from acute MI has improved markedly in the last 20 years with better medical care, the development of coronary care units and the recognition of
the importance of opening the occluded artery to reperfuse the damaged myocardium and limit infarct size.

Presentation and symptoms
Patients commonly present with acute-onset central
chest pain (see Ch. 4), although occasionally ACS may
be ‘silent’. Associated features include nausea, vomiting,

sweatiness, palpitations, dyspnoea, syncope and/or pulmonary oedema. The pain may radiate into the jaw, one
or both arms or may even be epigastric. The patient will
often be distressed.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of MI is based on the presence of at least
two out of three of the following features: (1) A typical
or suggestive cardiac history (See Ch 4), (2) specific ECG
changes, (3) Cardiac enzyme changes. These are criteria
set be by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Electrocardiogram
The earliest ECG changes or ‘hyperacute’ changes consist of tall, pointed T waves followed by elevation of
the ST segment. This is followed by T wave inversion,
the R wave voltage decreases and Q waves develop. After
weeks or months, the T wave may become upright again
but the Q waves remain (Fig. 30.4).
The site of the infarction may also be deduced from
the affected leads on the ECG:
•
•
•
•
•

Inferior MI: involves leads II, III and aVF.
Anterior MI: affects the precordial leads.
Anteroseptal MI: affects leads V1–V3.
Lateral MI: affects leads I and aVL, and V4–V6.
Posterior MI: there is a dominant R wave in leads
V1–V3 with ST-segment depression and upright T
waves.

There may also be ‘reciprocal’ ECG changes with STsegment depression in leads opposite to the site of
infarction.
Diagnostic criteria for STEMI are as follows:
• ST-segment elevation >2 mm in 2 or more chest
leads.
• ST-segment elevation >1 mm in 2 or more limb
leads.
• Posterior MI (see above).
• New-onset LBBB.

Cardiac enzymes
Cardiac enzymes are intracellular enzymes which leak
out of infarcted myocardium into the bloodstream
(Fig. 30.5):
• Elevated troponin I or T concentrations in the blood
are highly reliable markers of myocardial damage.

They are not ‘enzymes’ but proteins involved in myocyte contraction. They are most reliable 8–12 h post
event and remain elevated for several weeks.
• Creatine kinase (CK) peaks within 24 h. It is a cardiac
enzyme that is also produced by skeletal muscle and
brain. In cases of doubt, the myocardium-bound isoenzyme fraction of CK (CK-MB) can be requested,
which is specific for heart muscle damage. The site
of the infarct is related to the serum level of enzyme.
CK is therefore still used to assess reinfarction in patients whose troponin is elevated from a previous MI.
• Aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase were formerly used to assess MI as they remain
elevated for several days after CK has settled. Their
use is now largely obsolete.

Further tests
• A full blood count (FBC): anaemia.
• Urea and electrolytes (U&Es): renal and electrolyte
abnormalities.
• Chest X-ray (CXR): aortic dissection, signs of heart
failure and to assess cardiac size.
• Blood glucose.

Immediate primary angioplasty and stenting leads to
better immediate and long-term outcomes in acute
STEMI than thrombolysis. Patients with an STEMI
should therefore be treated immediately with primary
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). If the admitting hospital does not have 24-h PCI facilities, urgent
transfer should be arranged. Patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention should be
treated with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist.

Thrombolytic treatment
UK guidelines now state that if primary percutaneous
coronary intervention cannot be provided within
90 min of diagnosis, patients with an ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome should receive immediate thrombolytic therapy.
Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy are given
in Fig. 30.6. Major bleeding complications are seen in
approximately 1–3% of patients.
The two main thrombolytics are streptokinase and
alteplase, a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA). Streptokinase induces an antibody response,
which reduces the effectiveness of a repeat dose and increases the risk of an anaphylactic reaction. It should
therefore not be readministered in the period between
5 days and a minimum of 2 years following initial treatment. Streptokinase is now rarely used.

Management
Emergency care
The main aims are to prevent or treat cardiac arrest and to
relieve pain – the patient should ideally be managed on a
coronary care unit with continuous cardiac monitoring.
The ABC principles should be followed in the emergency
setting. Oxygen, sublingual nitrates, intravenous nitrate
and opiates such as diamorphine are given for pain relief.
Diamorphine relieves pain, but also alleviates sympathetic activation associated with the pain, which causes
vasoconstriction and increases the work of the heart. Antiemetics should be administered with opiates. Aspirin
(300 mg) should be given as soon as possible and is often

SBP, systolic blood pressure.

185

Cardiovascular system

Other therapy in the acute phase
Antiplatelet agents
Aspirin therapy 300 mg should be prescribed early. This
leads to a 30% reduction in deaths or 24 lives saved in
1000 treated. If aspirin sensitivity is present then clopidogrel should be used.

Beta-blockers
In the absence of hypotension or bradycardia, administration of beta-blockers in the acute phase, preferable intravenously, potentially limits infarct size, reducing the risk
of fatal arrhythmias. There is a 15% reduction in mortality
at 1 week. It is particularly appropriate when the patient
has a tachycardia (in the absence of heart failure), relative
hypertension or pain unresponsive to opioids. If the intravenous formulation is not available, start oral therapy.

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors
All patients should be commenced on ACE inhibitors if
tolerated as they produce survival benefit. ACE inhibitors are of most value in patients with clinical symptoms
or signs of heart failure, or impaired left ventricular
function echocardiographically. Opinions differ as to
the best time to initiate treatment – whether acutely
or after a few days. The benefits appear to be a class effect, and doses should be titrated to the target dose.

Statins
Statins should be started on admission, regardless of
cholesterol levels, as they may improve outcomes by
anti-inflammatory plaque-stabilizing effects.

Heparin
Patients with an ST-segment elevation acute coronary
syndrome who do not receive reperfusion therapy
should be treated immediately with low-molecularweight heparin.

Control of glucose
Patients with a STEMI and diabetes mellitus or marked
hyperglycaemia (>11.0 mmol/L) should have immediate intensive blood glucose control, commonly through
an insulin sliding scale regime. This should be continued for at least 24 h.

NON-ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
(NSTEMI) AND UNSTABLE ANGINA

Symptoms
The patient may have characteristic central ischaemic
chest pain (see Ch. 4) or more non-specific symptoms. Patients with chronic stable angina may note that their pain
is no longer relieved fully by glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), that

186

it is increasing in intensity or that it is occurring at rest.
These are all symptoms requiring urgent assessment.
HINTS AND TIPS
Don’t forget that ACS can present with atypical pain
such as epigastric pain or scapular pain. Diabetic
patients may not experience any pain, a ‘silent’ MI, due
to peripheral neuropathy.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of NSTEMI and unstable angina is based
on the presence of two out of three from a typical history, ischaemic ECG changes (but not meeting STEMI
criteria), positive cardiac enzyme test.

History
The history and clinical features are the same as those
for STEMI.

ECG
The ECG may show ST-segment depression, T wave flattening, biphasic changes or inversion. The deeper the
changes, the more worrying they are. The initial ECG
may be normal and serial ones are needed, preferably
when pain occurs, to demonstrate the dynamic ischaemia.
HINTS AND TIPS
Old ECGs are invaluable in assessing patients with chest
pain, allowing for comparison.

Cardiac enzymes
The measurement of troponin I or T concentration at
8–12 h after the onset of pain is crucial. As well as being
a highly specific marker of myocardial damage, it has
shown prognostic value, although interpretation may
be more difficult with renal impairment. Therefore, patients with non-evolving ECGs who are pain-free and
with a negative troponin result can safely be discharged
and have an exercise test and cardiovascular risk stratification as outpatients. Patients with positive troponin
NSTEMI events are at high risk for further events (30%
chance of STEMI at 1 month) and should be evaluated
for revascularization procedures as inpatients.

Risk scoring
All patients that present with ACS should have risk stratification using clinical scores. This allows clinicians to
identify those patients who are most likely to benefit

from early therapeutic intervention. Various scoring systems exist, but NICE now recommends the use of the
Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events (GRACE) score
(Fig. 30.7). The GRACE score is validated as a prognostic
tool to predict in hospital death and MI and mortality
and MI at 6 months. As such, those patients that have
a high-risk benefit from early intervention such as PCI
or CABG.

Management
Emergency care
The initial emergency management of NSTEMI and unstable angina is identical to that of STEMI: aspirin
300 mg, morphine and nitrates. The role of oxygen is controversial and newer guidelines do not comment on this.
The safest approach is to give oxygen, aiming for saturations between 94 and 98%. In the case of a cardiac arrest
secondary to ACS, high-flow oxygen must given.

Pharmacological management
Antiplatelet agents
Aspirin
Aspirin (300 mg) should be given straight away and is
often administered by paramedics. It should be continued daily at 75 mg.

Clopidogrel
Clopidogrel has been demonstrated to significantly improve outcomes in combination with aspirin in patients
with NSTEMI. It should also be used if aspirin is contraindicated. The first dose is 300 mg and subsequently
75 mg daily. This should be continued for 3 months.

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists
These are potent antiplatelet agents that block the binding of fibrinogen to the IIb/IIIa receptor on the platelet
surface. They are started if the pain continues or ECG
changes progress. They may settle the acute events on
their own but are usually part of a strategy including cardiac catheterization. The most common agents are tirofiban or eptifibatide. They have a significant risk of
causing bleeding, which should be assessed.

syndrome should be treated immediately with lowmolecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux. Heparin
should be given for at least 3–5 days and until pain-free
for 24 h. It is usually given as twice-daily enoxaparin.

Beta-blockers
Unless contraindicated (e.g. asthma, overt heart failure
or known marked left ventricular dysfunction), betablockers should be started. They have immediate antianginal effects and reduce the progression to acute
STEMI, reduce arrhythmias and improve survival. Examples include metoprolol, atenolol and carvedilol.

Rate-limiting calcium channel antagonists
For example diltiazam. This is an antianginal drug that
has negatively chronotropic effects. If beta-blockers are
contraindicated, then it is an alternative agent.

Statins
Statin therapy should be started immediately as per
management of STEMI.

ACE inhibitors
Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition
should start early in patients with NSTEMI. It is reasonable to start at a low dose and wait 12 h until the acute
event has settled, as hypotension is a risk.
Over 90% of patients with NSTEMI will become painfree and respond well to the above treatments. If pain
continues, complications such as cardiogenic shock ensue and/or the ECG changes progress, then additional
therapy is needed and the patient should be transferred
to a centre with interventional cardiology support.

Role of percutaneous coronary intervention
The big differential between NSTEMI and STEMI is the role
of PCI – it is not indicated in patients without STEMI or
new left bundle branch block (LBBB) because it has no
demonstrated benefit. However, angiography and angioplasty is recommended in ongoing NSTEMI or those at
moderate or high risk of mortality or future MI within
the first 96 h of admission (as calculated by GRACE score).

Subsequent inpatient
management of patients with ACS
General
Patients should be on bed rest for the first 24 h. If uncomplicated, the patient can then sit out of bed, use a
commode and undertake self-care and self-feeding. Ambulation can be started the next day and exercise is gradually built up to climbing stairs within a few days.

187

Cardiovascular system
In patients with proven NSTEMI the mortality at
1 year is up to 20%. All patients should have their
cardiovascular risks assessed and modified. Long-term
antiplatelet medications, statins, beta-blockers and ACE
inhibitors should be prescribed unless contraindicated.
The need for angioplasty or bypass surgery should be
considered with stress testing or angiography.

These patients should then have angiography prior to
discharge.

Complications of myocardial
infarction
A summary of the complications that may occur as a result of MI is given in Fig. 30.8.

Thromboprophylaxis
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may
be prevented by subcutaneous heparin when in bed.
If they do occur, the patient should be treated initially
with heparin, followed by oral anticoagulation. Patients
are usually started on a low-molecular-weight heparin
after admission to the coronary care unit.

Further investigations and risk
stratification
Post-MI patients should undergo echocardiography to
assess valve and systolic function. Most patients can
safely undergo a limited exercise test after being painfree for 5–7 days. If normal, they can be followed up
in clinic with no further testing. Increased risk of further
events and death include:
• Continuing angina.
• Heart failure.
• Positive exercise or pharmacological stress test.

Cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock
Left ventricular failure during the acute phase of MI is
associated with a poor prognosis. Repeated examination of the heart and lungs for signs of incipient heart
failure should be performed in all patients (Fig. 30.9).
Echocardiography can be helpful in the assessment
of ventricular function, mitral regurgitation and ventricular septal defects.
The management of heart failure is described later in
this chapter. Cardiogenic shock is defined as an inability
to perfuse end organs, resulting in tissue hypoxia secondary to pump failure.
Other causes of shock should be excluded such as
hypovolaemia, vasovagal reactions, drugs or arrhythmias. Ventricular and valvular function should be evaluated by echocardiography. Inotropic agents are of
value: dobutamine (5–20 mg/kg/min) is first line. Correction of acidosis is important for myocardial function,

although improving cardiac output itself improves lactic acidosis, which is the usual cause.
Emergency angiography and angioplasty or surgery
should be considered.

Cardiac rupture
Free wall rupture, if acute, is usually fatal within minutes. If subacute, there is haemodynamic deterioration
with hypotension and signs of cardiac tamponade. Immediate surgery is needed.
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) occurs in 1% of all infarctions, appearing early after MI. Without surgery, the
mortality is 50% within the first week and 90% within
the first year. It should be suspected if there is clinical
deterioration and a loud pansystolic murmur at the left
sternal edge. Treatment is by surgical closure of the defect and bypass grafts as necessary.

Mitral regurgitation
The incidence of moderately severe or severe mitral
regurgitation is approximately 4% and the mortality
without surgery is high at approximately 20%. Valve replacement is the procedure of choice in papillary muscle
dysfunction and rupture.

Arrhythmias and conduction disturbances
These are extremely common in the early period following MI. Often, the arrhythmias are not hazardous in
themselves but are a manifestation of a serious underlying disorder such as continuing ischaemia, vagal overactivity or electrolyte disturbance that requires attention,
particularly potassium and magnesium. Arrhythmias
can also occur following reperfusion. The management
of arrhythmias is covered in detail in this chapter.

Ventricular arrhythmias
Ventricular arrhythmias may present as ventricular
ectopics, ventricular tachycardia (VT), or ventricular
fibrillation (VF).
Ventricular ectopics are almost universal on the
first day and require no treatment if the patient is
asymptomatic.

30

Short episodes of VT may be well tolerated and require no treatment. More prolonged episodes may cause
hypotension and heart failure. Amiodarone or lidocaine
are the drugs of choice. Direct current (DC) cardioversion may be required if haemodynamically significant
VT persists.
Ventricular fibrillation is associated with approximately 5% of MI. It is not compatible with life. If VF occurs, immediate defibrillation should be performed as
part of the Advanced Life Support protocol.
When arrhythmias occur late in the course of MI,
they are liable to recur and are associated with a high
risk of death. If it is probable that the arrhythmia
is induced by ischaemia, revascularization should be
considered. If this is unlikely, antiarrhythmic agents
(e.g. beta-blockers and amiodarone) and electrophysiologically guided treatment may be given. In some cases,
an implantable defibrillator is indicated.

Supraventricular arrhythmias
Atrial fibrillation (AF) complicates 15–20% of MIs and
is often associated with severe left ventricular damage
and heart failure; it is usually self-limiting. If the heart
rate is fast, bisoprolol or digoxin are effective in slowing
the rate but amiodarone is more efficacious in terminating the arrhythmia.
Other supraventricular arrhythmias are rare but are
also usually self-limiting. They may respond to carotid
sinus massage. Beta-blockers may be effective and DC
shock should be employed if the arrhythmia is poorly
tolerated.

Sinus bradycardia and heart block
Sinus bradycardia is common early on, especially in inferior MI, and responds to atropine in boluses titrated
against response, although large doses of atropine
should be avoided.
Atrioventricular (AV) block is common in inferior MI
as the right coronary artery supplies the AV node and
may respond to atropine, although patients may go
on to need a permanent pacemaker. However, it may
take up to 14 days before normal conduction is restored.
Heart block with anterior MI is ominous because it
indicates a large infarct. The development of LBBB or
bifascicular block may presage complete heart block
and is an indication for temporary pacemaker insertion.
If complete heart block does occur and persists, a permanent pacemaker will be needed.

Pericarditis
This can occur within the first few days, causing pain that
is sharp in nature and varies with posture and respiration.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by a pericardial rub.
If troublesome, it may be treated with high-dose aspirin,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
steroids. Dressler’s syndrome is fever, leucocytosis,
pericarditis and serositis occurring up to 3 months after

189

Cardiovascular system
MI because of an autoimmune response to the damaged
myocardium. Treatment is as for pericarditis.

Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is aimed at restoring the patient to as full
a life as possible and must take into account physical,
physiological and socioeconomic factors. The process
should start as soon as possible after hospital admission
and should be continued in the succeeding weeks and
months. Depression and denial are common. Lifestyle
advice should be individualized and include advice
on diet, exercise and smoking cessation.

Secondary prevention
Smoking
Observational studies show that those who stop smoking
have a mortality in the succeeding years of less than half
that of those who continue to smoke. It is potentially the
most effective of all the secondary prevention measures.
All smokers should be counselled to stop smoking. Nicotine replacement therapy may be of value.

Hypertension
The blood pressure should be controlled to below 130/
85 mmHg.

Fasting glucose, lipids and diet
Assessment for diabetes before discharge is essential as it
indicates a worse prognosis. Immediately after MI, lipid
levels are unreliable and all patients should be on statin
therapy. Fasting lipid levels should be part of routine
follow-up in clinic over subsequent years.
All patients should be discharged on the ‘big four’
drugs (listed below) unless contraindicated, because
all show benefit in secondary prevention.
Weight reduction should be encouraged if overweight by a combination of diet and exercise.

Antiplatelet treatment
Aspirin 75 mg daily reduces the risk of reinfarction and
death by 25%. There is no clear benefit of oral anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy, although it may be
considered for patients with left ventricular aneurysm,
atrial fibrillation or echocardiographically proven left
ventricular thrombus.

Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers reduce the risk of mortality and reinfarction by 20–25%. Approximately 25% of patients have
relative contraindications to beta-blockers because of
uncontrolled heart failure, respiratory disease or other
conditions. Calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil may be used if beta-blockers are
contraindicated.

190

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors
Provided there are no contraindications, ACE inhibitors
are of benefit to all after MI. However, patients at low
risk gain only marginal benefit, and these drugs are often reserved for people with clinical or echocardiographic signs of heart failure or anterior MI.

Lipid-lowering agents
There are clear benefits from treatment with statins. The
risk of subsequent major coronary heart disease events is
lowered. All subgroups of patients appear to benefit from
treatment even if initial levels of cholesterol are ‘normal’.

ARRHYTHMIAS

Introduction
An arrhythmia is a disturbance of normal sinus cardiac
rhythm. Arrhythmias are very common, often intermittent, but may cause cardiac compromise. They are commonly secondary to IHD, particularly after MI.
Ventricular ectopic beats are extremely common in
the first 24 h following an MI, but any arrhythmia including conduction disturbances may occur. Other
causes include drugs (prescribed or illicit), cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, thyroid dysfunction and electrolyte disturbances.

Clinical features
Arrhythmias may present with palpitations (see Ch. 6),
dizziness, angina, shortness of breath (see Ch. 5), syncope, cardiac arrest or sudden death; they may also be
symptomless. The history should focus on symptoms
and possible underlying aetiologies.
HINTS AND TIPS
Ask the patient to tap out the rhythm – it helps in
determining whether the rhythm is regular or irregular
and gives you some idea of the heart rate.

Investigations
An ECG with a long rhythm strip will allow diagnosis of
the arrhythmia if present at the time of the test. Make
sure to look for signs of ischaemia when assessing the
ECG. For infrequent symptoms, 24-h Holter monitoring (with a diary of events) may record the rhythm disturbance. Other routine investigations should include
FBC, U&Es, calcium, magnesium, thyroid function tests
(TFTs) and a chest radiograph. An echocardiogram
should be considered to look for structural cardiac disease. More prolonged ambulatory monitoring over

30

Arrhythmias
weeks or months should be considered in difficult problems. Echocardiography may be useful in diagnosing an
underlying structural cause such as mitral valve disease
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Finally, electrophysiological studies may reveal an
arrhythmogenic focus; radiofrequency ablation can destroy this focus and response to treatment may be
assessed, but this is only available in specialized centres.

Supraventricular arrhythmias

•
•
•
•

Pneumonia.
Atrial myxoma.
Endocarditis.
Infiltrative diseases of the heart (e.g. sarcoidosis).

Clinically, there is an irregularly irregular pulse and the
apical rate can be greater than the rate at the radial artery
since the pulse volume varies. The first heart sound is of
variable intensity.
The ECG shows absent P waves and irregular narrow
complex QRS complexes (unless there is associated
BBB) (Fig. 30.10).

Sinus tachycardia
This is defined as a heart rate of >100 bpm originating
from the SA node. It can be entirely physiological (e.g. during exercise), but may be pathological. Causes include
anaemia, pulmonary embolism, pain, sepsis, thyroid toxicosis, hypovolaemia or heart failure. Treating the underlying cause should resolve the tachycardia. Rarely patients
suffer with idiopathic inappropriate sinus tachycardia,
which is though to be due to abnormal autonomic tone.

Atrial fibrillation
Aetiology and pathophysiology
This is an irregular, chaotic atrial rhythm at a rate of
300–600 bpm. It is transmitted to the ventricles via
the AV node at different intervals leading to an irregular
heart rate, dependent on the speed of conduction and
refractoriness down the AV node. The incidence rises
with age and is over 10% in those over 75 years old.
It may be idiopathic, secondary to chronic heart disease
or a response to acute illness. Causes include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

IHD.
Mitral valve disease.
Hyperthyroidism.
Hypertension.
Cardiomyopathy.
Excess alcohol consumption.
Pericarditis.

A

Complications
The most common complication associated with AF is
thromboembolic disease. Poor synchronization of
atrial contraction results in the formation of thrombus.
The thrombus can embolize anywhere in the systemic
circulation, but frequently causes stroke, although
ischaemic gut is also encountered. Patients should
therefore be anticoagulated to reduce the risk of systemic emboli. Anticoagulation can be achieved with either warfarin or aspirin depending on risk profile
(CHADS score). If the patient has contraindications to
warfarin, aspirin should be used but it is less effective
in preventing strokes. A new oral anticoagulation agent,
dabigatran etexilate, is a direct thrombin inhibitor. Current trials are looking promising and NICE are in the
process of its technical appraisal. It is likely that it will
play a major role in anticoagulation for patients with
atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves or post orthopaedic operations.
Heart failure can be a result of uncontrolled AF. The
management of heart failure is discussed in this chapter.

Management
In long-standing atrial fibrillation there is debate as to
whether conversion back to sinus rhythm or simple rate
control is best. The ventricular rate can usually be
Fig. 30.10 Electrocardiogram of
atrial fibrillation with a slow
ventricular rate (A) and fast
ventricular rate (B).

B

191

Cardiovascular system
controlled with a beta-blocker, calcium antagonist or digoxin. Other classes of drug may sometimes be required.
If the atrial fibrillation is of recent onset, DC cardioversion or intravenous flecainide to restore sinus rhythm
may be attempted. After more than 2 days of atrial fibrillation the patient should be fully anticoagulated for at
least 1 month before cardioversion. If this is unsuccessful, the aim is control of the ventricular rate.

AVNRT

Atrial flutter

AVRT

This is due to a regular circus movement of continuous
atrial depolarization. As the AV node cannot conduct
that fast, it is usually transmitted with a degree of block
(e.g. 2:1, 3:1, etc.).
The causes and treatment are similar to those for
atrial fibrillation.
The ECG shows a ‘sawtooth’ appearance to the baseline at 300 bpm due to flutter or F waves (Fig. 30.11).
The ventricular rate is usually divisible into this (e.g.
150 bpm in 2:1 block or 100 bpm in 3:1 block).

If the heart rate is 150 bpm, always consider atrial
flutter with 2:1 block as the diagnosis.

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias
Paroxysmal SVT is normally due to the presence of a
second pathway between the atria and ventricles. An
impulse is conducted normally through one AV connection and is then conducted retrogradely up the other,
causing a premature atrial contraction. This is then
conducted down the first AV connection. On each occasion, the ventricle also depolarizes, giving rise to a fast
ventricular rate. The refractory period for an accessory
pathway may be shorter than the AV node, leading to
ventricular rates exceeding 200 bpm. Broadly speaking,
supraventricular tachycardias are divided into AV reentry (AVRT) and AV nodal non-re-entry tachycardias
(AVNRT) rhythms.

A

B

192

This condition is due to a re-entry accessory circuit not
involving the AV node. Patients tend to present at a
younger age, as these pathways are often congenital
and specialist referral is mandatory. AVRT frequently
settle with flecainide, but may require accessory pathway ablation to cure the condition. Wolff–Parkinson–
White (WPW) syndrome is an example of a congenital
AVRT.

Management
Non-pharmacological

HINTS AND TIPS

Fig. 30.11 Electrocardiogram of
atrial flutter. (A) Atrial flutter with 4:1
block. (B) Atrial flutter with 2:1 block.

This is the commonest cause of a narrow complex tachycardia. By definition the re-entry is through the AV
node. The predominant symptom is palpitations. The
condition is commonly benign and may require no
treatment beyond termination of the tachycardia (see
below).

Initially, try vagal stimulation, which can be achieved in
the following ways:
• Valsalva manoeuvre: ask the patient to blow against
resistance (the closed glottis) for approximately 15 s,
as if straining at stool. The tachycardia usually terminates in the relaxation (parasympathetic) phase.
• Carotid sinus massage: massage of the carotid artery
at the level of the thyroid cartilage.
• Diving reflex: the patient holds his breath while the
face is wetted with cold water.
• Eye pressure: this should not now be done as it may
cause retinal detachment.
HINTS AND TIPS
Intravenous adenosine can be administered to reveal
the underlying rhythm in supraventricular tachycardias
by temporarily blocking the AV node.

30

Arrhythmias

Torsades de pointes (‘twisting of
the points’)

Fig. 30.12 Electrocardiogram of ventricular tachycardia.

Pharmacological
Intravenous adenosine is the treatment of choice in
AVNRT. Digoxin or intravenous beta-blockers may also
be effective, although care must be taken if there is any
evidence of pre-excitation. Intravenous verapamil can
be useful for patients without MI or valvular disease.
If the arrhythmia is poorly tolerated, synchronized
DC shock usually provides rapid relief.
Potassium and magnesium levels should be checked
and corrected.
If the patient is already on digoxin, the levels should
be checked to exclude toxicity.

This is a special form of so-called ‘polymorphic’ VT,
which tends to occur in the presence of a long QT interval. It may progress to VF and is often refractory to treatment, which is with intravenous magnesium sulphate.
Antiarrhythmics may further prolong the QT interval
and worsen the condition. Overdrive pacing may be
effective.

Ventricular fibrillation
VF is an emergency and requires immediate Advanced
Life Support©, DC shock with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (Fig. 30.13).
HINTS AND TIPS
Patients have different interpretations of the word
‘palpitations’. Make sure they are clear with what is
meant. They may mean a fast rate or a sensation of a
single beat, or an awareness of normal heart rate. Tap
out different rates or rhythms for them to get more
information.

Ventricular tachycardia
Diagnosis
VT is defined as three or more consecutive ventricular
extrasystoles with a rate greater than 120 bpm
(Fig. 30.12).

Management
If there is no pulse, or circulatory collapse, then treat
with DC shock as per advanced life support algorithms
or synchronized DC cardioversion, respectively. If conscious, the patient will require an anaesthetic. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. If the patient
has a stable blood pressure, then response to amiodarone can be assessed in a monitored environment.
Drug treatment is also used for prophylaxis of recurrent attacks. The most common setting is after MI; amiodarone is the preferred therapy for emergency use. Other
options include lidocaine or procainamide.

Bradycardias
Sinus bradycardia
Sinus bradycardia is defined as a resting pulse rate of
<60 bpm. For notes on sinus bradycardia see Ch. 6.

Sick sinus syndrome
This is due to dysfunction of the sinus node and can lead
to periods of sinus bradycardia with periods of asystole,
and tachycardia. Dual-chamber pacemakers are now
fitted as standard, although they will only function as
an atrial pacemaker if there is no AV conduction defect.

Heart block
This refers to aberrant conduction through the heart and
has three forms, termed first-, second- and third-degree
block. As the ‘degree of block’ increases so does the

irregular waves of no defined shape. In this trace there are short periods suggestive of ventricular flutter.

MI, then a permanent pacemaker can be fitted as a
semi-elective procedure.
HINTS AND TIPS
In complete heart block, work out the atrial rate and
the ventricular rate separately by marking them on
a piece of paper. They should both be regular but at
different rates.

Fig. 30.14 Electrocardiogram of first-degree heart block.

seriousness of the problem (i.e. first-degree block is usually unimportant whilst third-degree block is an
emergency).

Antiarrhythmic drugs

The ECG shows a prolonged PR interval (more than
0.2 s) (Fig. 30.14). All impulses are conducted to the
ventricles.

Traditionally, antiarrhythmics are classified according
to their effects on the action potential (Vaughan
Williams classification; Fig. 30.18). However, this is
now of less clinical relevance than a classification based
on the site of action in the heart – supraventricular,
ventricular and both. Examples of antiarrhythmic drugs
are given below.

Second-degree heart block

Supraventricular arrhythmias only

Only some of the atrial impulses are conducted via the
AV node. In Wenckebach (Mobitz type I) heart block,
there is progressive widening of the PR interval, culminating in non-conduction through the AV node. The cycle then continues (Fig. 30.15). Mobitz type II heart
block is intermittent failure of AV conduction
(Fig. 30.16). This is the more serious of the two because
the block is below the AV node in the His bundle, which
may lead to third-degree block. The block occurs in the
AV node and hence escape rhythms are more stable in
Wenckebach block.

Adenosine

First-degree heart block

Third-degree (complete) heart block
This is complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular contraction (Fig. 30.17). The ventricular rate assumes a slow ‘escape’ rhythm with a rate between 30
and 50 bpm. All negatively chronotropic drugs should
be stopped. If the patient is symptomatic, atropine
can be tried. If this fails, a temporary pacing wire needs
to be inserted. Isoprenaline infusion is no longer used
routinely. If the patient remains stable or the rhythm
problem does not resolve, as they commonly do post
Fig. 30.15 Electrocardiogram of
Wenckebach heart block.

P

P

Adenosine is used for terminating paroxysmal SVT. It is
a purine nucleoside, which causes transient AV block.
The half-life is 8–10 s but is longer if the patient is taking
dipyridamole. It can cause flushing, chest pain and
bronchospasm – it is important to warn patients of
these prior to giving the drug.

Verapamil
Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker and an
alternative to adenosine and should not be used for
wide-complex tachycardias unless a supraventricular origin has been established beyond doubt. It should not
be used with beta-blockers.

Digoxin
Digoxin is a purified cardiac glycoside (derived from
foxgloves) and, although its mechanism is not fully understood, is thought to have its effect through binding
to the Na/K ATPase of cardiac myocytes. Its main role
is in reducing ventricular rate. It has a mildly positive
ionotropic effect. Digoxin toxicity can be dangerous
and levels should be monitored.

Supraventricular and ventricular
arrhythmias
Amiodarone
Amiodarone is effective in both types of arrhythmia
with little deleterious effect on haemodynamics. This
means it is widely used on coronary care units in acute
settings (e.g. post MI). In chronic dysrhythmias, its
main indication is in prevention of life-threatening
VF/VT. In this, it is less effective than an implanted defibrillator. Otherwise, it should only be used when
other drugs are ineffective or contraindicated, and usually under hospital supervision. It can be used orally or
intravenously for rapid effect. The half-life is several
weeks. It may therefore take some weeks to achieve
steady-state plasma concentration.

It is an iodine-containing compound and side effects
include hypo- and hyperthyroidism and liver dysfunction. TFTs and liver function tests (LFTs) should therefore be checked at baseline and every 6 months. It
may cause pulmonary fibrosis, corneal microdeposits
(which are reversible on stopping treatment) and
photosensitivity.

Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers act mainly by attenuating the effects of the
sympathetic nervous system on automaticity and conductivity within the heart. Sotalol is a beta-blocker that
also has class III actions. It is used widely to control paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).

Flecainide
Fig. 30.18 The Vaughan Williams classification of
antiarrhythmic drugs.

Flecainide is used acutely to cardiovert patients in new
atrial fibrillation, if there is no structural heart disease or
heart failure, with good success rates. It is excellent for
the control of PAF. In a trial in which it was successfully
used to suppress premature ventricular contractions
post MI, it was associated with increased mortality compared to placebo – demonstrating the maxim ‘treat the
patient, not the result’.

Lidocaine

Heart failure secondary to intrinsic heart
disease

Lidocaine was used commonly for VT after an MI but it
can only be given intravenously. It can be used in patients with haemodynamically stable VT to attempt to
cardiovert to sinus rhythm. In most situations, amiodarone is now preferred. The dose should be decreased
with cardiac or liver failure to avoid convulsions, depression of the central nervous system or depression
of the cardiovascular system.

Magnesium
Magnesium sulphate is indicated in broad complex
tachycardias in the presence of hypokalaemia (potassium less than 4.0 mmol/L). Magnesium sulphate is
also indicated in cardiac arrest for refractory ventricular
fibrillation in the presence of suspected hypomagnesaemia or refractory ventricular tachycardia in the presence
of suspected hypomagnesaemia.

Cardiogenic heart failure is due to an abnormality of the
heart and can be unmasked when a heart with reduced
reserve is unable to cope with the often seemingly minor
stresses placed on it. These may manifest at rest or more
usually on exertion. Causes include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

IHD (65% of new UK cases per year).
Hypertension.
Valvular heart disease.
Infection: viruses, Chagas’ disease.
Toxins: alcohol, chemotherapy.
Nutritional deficiency: beriberi.
Post partum.
Tachycardia-induced: atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.
Genetic: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

High-output heart failure

HEART FAILURE
Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to maintain sufficient cardiac output to meet the demands
placed on it by the body. It is a syndrome as a direct consequence of an underlying pathology such as IHD or
cardiomyopathy. The problem is usually one of failure
of myocardium, although excess pre- and afterload plus
rhythm disturbances and increased demand beyond
that of a normal heart’s capacity are possible. Failure
can be systolic, due to impairment of contraction, diastolic, an impairment of relaxation, or a combination
of both. The incidence rises with age and almost 1 million adults in the UK have heart failure. It is classified by
its severity (Fig. 30.19). The mortality in severe heart
failure is approximately 40% at 1 year.

A normal heart is unable to maintain an increased cardiac output in the face of grossly elevated requirements.
It is then unable to meet these requirements. Conditions causing this include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Thyrotoxicosis.
Anaemia.
AV shunts.
Beriberi.
Fever.
Paget’s disease.
Pregnancy.

Such conditions may also cause a previously silent cardiac problem to manifest itself.

Clinical features
Left heart failure
In left ventricular failure inadequate cardiac output
leads to elevated left atrial pressures and these combine
to give the majority of clinical findings. Symptoms
include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Exertional dyspnoea (most common).
Orthopnoea.
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND).
Fatigue.
Wheeze (‘cardiac asthma’).
Cough.
Haemoptysis (rare).

Signs include:
• Tachypnoea.
• Tachycardia.

Heart failure
• Pulsus alternans (alternating large- and smallvolume pulse).
• Peripheral cyanosis and low pulse volume.
• Cardiomegaly.
• Third heart sound (‘S3 gallop’).
• Functional mitral regurgitation secondary to dilatation of the mitral valve annulus.
• Basal crepitations indicating pulmonary oedema.
• Pleural effusions.
Acute left ventricular failure is a medical emergency and
typically presents with severe dyspnoea due to pulmonary oedema. Patients will be sitting up, distressed, pale
and sweaty and may even be coughing up pink frothy
sputum. Clinical features will include tachycardia, fine
crackles and a raised JVP.

Right heart failure
This may occur secondary to chronic lung disease, multiple pulmonary emboli, primary pulmonary hypertension, right heart valve disease, left-to-right shunts or
isolated right ventricular cardiomyopathy. It is commonly associated with left ventricular failure, in which
case the term congestive cardiac failure is used. Elevated
right atrial pressures lead to peripheral fluid retention.
Symptoms include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fatigue.
Nausea.
Wasting.
Swollen ankles.
Abdominal discomfort.
Anorexia.
Breathlessness.

Signs include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

A raised jugular venous pressure (JVP).
Smooth hepatomegaly.
Liver tenderness.
Pitting oedema.
Ascites.
Functional tricuspid regurgitation.
Tachycardia.
Right ventricular third heart sound.

Congestive cardiac failure
Congestive cardiac failure (CCF) is failure of both the
right and the left ventricles. As such the clinical findings
are a combination of those listed above. Bilateral pleural effusions tend to be a common feature.

Investigations
The cause for the heart failure must always be sought because heart failure itself is an inadequate diagnosis. After
the history and examination, investigations include the
following.

30

Blood tests
•
•
•
•

FBC: anaemia.
U&Es: renal dysfunction or electrolyte abnormalities.
LFTs: liver congestion.
Cardiac enzymes/troponin: if acute onset, to exclude
acute coronary syndromes.
• Thyroid function tests.

Imaging
• CXR: cardiomegaly, alveolar oedema, ‘bat’s wings
shadowing’, prominent upper lobe vessels, Kerley
B lines, pleural effusions.
• Echocardiography: remains the gold standard investigation and can assess ventricular and valvular
function.

Other investigations
• ECG: IHD, arrhythmias and left ventricular hypertrophy. Finding a normal ECG has a very strong negative predictive value against heart failure.
• Exercise testing: functional severity and prognosis.
• Cardiac catheterization: assess and treat ischaemic/
valve lesions or rarely biopsy myocardium with
cardiomyopathy.
• Nuclear techniques: ejection fraction, cardiac function and reversible ischaemia.
• Brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide: this a marker of
ventricular dysfunction and may help in the assessment of suspected cardiac failure. A low plasma level
makes the diagnosis of heart failure unlikely. It can
be used to determine the need for echocardiography.

Management of chronic heart
failure
General
Hear failure is a complex syndrome of symptoms and
should be managed according to recent NICE guidelines
(August 2010). The underlying cause of the heart failure
should be sought and treated appropriately. Exacerbating factors such as anaemia and hypertension should be
treated. Patients should be advised to maintain an optimal weight, avoid excessive salt intake and alcohol consumption and stop smoking.

Drug treatment
These are divided into drugs which improve symptoms
of heart failure, namely diuretics and digoxin, and those
which are improving prognosis, namely ACE inhibitors,
certain beta-blockers and spironolactone. They reduce
the risk of MI and increase survival. Treatment is best
planned as a stepped care plan in outpatients when
stable.

197

Cardiovascular system
ACE inhibitors
The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system is activated
in heart failure. ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensinmediated vasoconstriction, reducing afterload, and decrease aldosterone-mediated salt and water retention.
This improves the function of the damaged heart. Many
studies have been performed using various ACE inhibitors in settings from post acute MI to cardiomyopathy
in outpatients. Their effects are class effects, and they
have revolutionized systolic heart failure treatment by
reducing symptoms, hospitalizations and mortality.
They should therefore be started early in any patient
with heart failure.
Side effects include cough, first-dose hypotension,
hyperkalaemia and worsening renal function, especially
in people with bilateral renal artery stenosis. As such,
they should be commenced at a low dose and increased
gradually with regular electrolyte monitoring. Commonly used drugs include ramipril, enalapril, perindopril and lisinopril.

Beta-blockers
For many years, it was assumed that these were contraindicated in heart failure because the sympathetic nervous system was compensating for the failing heart
and blocking this was deleterious. This remains true
in the acute setting, where the negatively inotropic
and chronotropic effects of beta-blockade can be harmful. However, it is thought that high circulating levels of
catecholamines cause progressive myocardial damage.
Indeed, the level appears to correlate with prognosis.
Three beta-blockers have shown improved function
and survival for patients with moderate to severe heart
failure. They are carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol.
They can be considered to interfere with the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone axis from the opposite end
to ACE inhibitors and spironolactone. These should
only be commenced in stable patients by experienced
clinicians. The progress should be carefully monitored
and the dose increased slowly – ‘start low, go slow’.

Spironolactone
Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that was
more commonly used in ascites as a diuretic. Aldosterone
may act directly as a deleterious growth factor on myocytes in addition to its salt- and water-retaining effects.
In a study using low (non-diuretic) doses, it improved
morbidity and mortality (RALES trial). Side effects include hyperkalaemia and, because it is usually given with
ACE inhibitors, electrolytes need monitoring.

inhibitors as these do not completely suppress angiotensin II production.

Loop diuretics
Loop diuretics, commonly furosemide and bumetanide, are very effective at reducing symptoms in patients
with heart failure in both acute and chronic care. They
help manage the fluid balance of patients. Side effects
include hypovolaemia and renal impairment if diuresis
is excessive, electrolyte disturbance and rarely ototoxicity. Renal function should be monitored regularly. They
have not demonstrated improvement in survival in
any trial.

Thiazide diuretics
These are rarely used alone in cardiac failure. Metolazone is reserved for severe symptomatic heart failure because, when coupled with a loop diuretic, it can produce
very profound diuresis.

Digoxin
As well as its effectiveness in rate control of patients with
atrial fibrillation, digoxin is a mild positive inotrope because of its effect in increasing intracellular calcium. As
such, it may have benefits in cardiac failure even in patients with sinus rhythm. It does not improve survival
but may reduce symptoms and hospital admissions.
Side effects causing concern include rhythm disturbances, nausea and visual disturbances. Therapeutic
drug monitoring allows effective dosing to minimize
complications. Digoxin should only be added to patients in sinus rhythm with heart failure not responding
to accepted best practice.

Nitrates and hydralazine
These are powerful vasodilating drugs that can improve
the symptoms of heart failure and may improve prognosis. Their only use currently is in patients who are unable
to take ACE inhibitors. They may be more effective in
black patients than standard therapy.

Ionotropic therapy
In chronic heart failure in the UK, there is little role for
intravenous therapy with positive inotropic drugs other
than as a bridge to transplantation in end-stage disease.
Inotropes used include milrinone, a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor, and the beta-agonist dobutamine.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers

Warfarin

Similar to ACE inhibitors, these interfere with the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Their exact
place in therapy is less certain. They are usually used
in patients who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor (e.g.
for cough). They can be used in addition to ACE

Patients with severe heart failure and cardiomyopathy
are at risk of thrombus formation and systemic embolization and, accordingly, warfarin should be considered
in patients with poor systolic function regardless of
atrial fibrillation.

Non-drug therapy

Management of acute heart failure

General

This is an emergency characterized by acute breathlessness, orthopnoea, wheezing, anxiety and sweating.
There may be pink, frothy sputum and ischaemic chest
pain, as well as signs of pulmonary oedema. The first
aim is to relieve symptoms and stabilize the patient,
the second is to support other organs with adequate
perfusion and the third is to find and treat the cause.
If severe, the management should begin before investigations are performed:

Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking. Alcohol intake should be discussed, and those who suffer
with alcohol-related cardiomyopathy should be encouraged to abstain completely. Annual vaccinations for
influenza and a one-off pneumococcal vaccination
should be offered.

Cardiac rehabilitation
Graded supervised group-based exercise programmes
and patient education encourage activity and independence. NICE recommends the inclusion of a psychological and educational component in the rehabilitation
programme.

Biventricular pacemakers
Patients with intraventricular conduction delay (as
shown by a widened QRS complex) have poorly coordinated ventricular contraction, which further reduces
ejection fraction. Resynchronizing this using a standard
right atrial and right ventricular pacemaker plus a left
ventricular pacing wire via the coronary sinus improves
cardiac output in some patients. If coupled with firstdegree heart block, the effect can be further improved.
The long-term benefit is uncertain.

Implantable cardioverter/defibrillator
Patients with cardiomyopathy often have abnormal
conduction systems and are at an increased risk of
dysrhythmias, in particular VF and tachycardia. One
therapy is long-term amiodarone, although its effectiveness is doubted. If the risk is significant, then an implantable defibrillator is the preferred option.

Left ventricular assist devices
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are mechanical
circulatory devices that can be used to partially or
completely replace the function of the failing heart.
Their most common clinical indication is post cardiac
surgery where the device allows for cardiac recovery.

Transplantation
Heart transplantation can be performed as a treatment
for chronic heart failure. The extent of the surgery and
postoperative immunosuppression does mean only a
select patient group is suitable for transplantation. Furthermore, the heart is a particularly sensitive organ
when it comes to ischaemia and, as a result, the number
of organs available are substantially lower than, for example, donor kidneys. The current prognosis for heart
transplantation is very good, with 70% of all-comers
alive at 5 years.

• Sit the patient upright.
• Give high-concentration oxygen unless there is coexisting chronic hypercapnia due to long-standing respiratory failure.
• Respiratory support with continuous positive airway
pressure to improve oxygenation or non-invasive
ventilatory support can be used effectively. If failing,
involve an anaesthetist early.
Traditional therapy involves:
• Diamorphine (2.5–5 mg IV) slowly with an antiemetic to reduce anxiety and reduce venous capacitance to reduce preload.
• Diuresis with furosemide (40–80 mg IV if renal
function normal). Furosemide may work initially
by vasodilatation.
• Give IV venodilators (e.g. GTN) if systolic blood
pressure is greater than 100 mmHg. This will reduce
preload.
Many cardiologists feel that, in acute cardiogenic shock,
where the patient is not overloaded with fluid but where
it is merely wrongly distributed due to the failing haemodynamics of the heart, first-line therapy should be
with a nitrate, sublingual if needed, and that furosemide
is of secondary importance.
Treat other conditions that may compromise cardiac
function:
• Fast atrial fibrillation: digoxin, orally or intravenously. Other arrhythmias should be treated appropriately. DC cardioversion may be needed.
Further management if the above is inadequate needs to
be in a critical care unit (CCU/HDU/ICU):
• Intravenous inotropic agents may be of value if
there is hypotension. If pulmonary congestion
is dominant, dobutamine is preferred at 5 mg/
kg/min, increasing gradually to 20 mg/kg/min
if needed. Remember, dobutamine has vasodilating properties and so may not have the effect
on blood pressure that is expected. It can be
combined with low doses of noradrenaline
(norepinephrine).
• If the pulmonary oedema is not improving, then
acute haemofiltration can remove fluid rapidly
and prevent intubation.

199

Cardiovascular system
• Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in primary
cardiac failure may be available (in specialist units
only) to support the heart while therapy is planned.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember LMNOP for the management of acute left
ventricular failure: Loop diuretic, Morphine, Nitrates,
Oxygen and Position.

HYPERTENSION
Hypertension is defined as a systemic blood pressure
persistently above 140/90 mmHg. The prevalence of hypertension differs depending on blood pressure cut-off
points, age, sex and race. It increases with age, and is
more common in men and Afro-Caribbeans. The risk
of morbidity and mortality rises continuously with increasing blood pressure, and marginal risk is greater at
higher blood pressures. Similarly, the lower the blood
pressure achieved with treatment, the lower the risk of
complications of hypertension. However, the benefit
of lowering diastolic blood pressure to below 90 mmHg
is minimal in uncomplicated hypertension in young or
middle-aged patients.
Blood pressure should be taken sitting or lying after
2–3 min rest. The air bladder within the cuff should
cover at least 80% of the arm circumference, otherwise,
in obese patients, artificially high readings are observed.
The dial or mercury column should fall slowly and be
read to the nearest 2 mmHg. The diastolic pressure is
recorded at the disappearance of sounds (i.e. Korotkoff
phase V). Readings should be taken on separate occasions and in both arms before a formal diagnosis of
hypertension can be made. If the reading is >140/
90 mmHg in clinic, the patient should be offered
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to confirm the
diagnosis.

Essential hypertension
In 95% of people, the diagnosis of hypertension is idiopathic (‘essential’) (i.e. no cause can be found).

Aetiology
Genetic influences on blood pressure regulation have
been suggested by family studies. Factors implicated include defects in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
axis, problems with sodium handling and increased
sympathetic nervous system activation. A number of environmental factors are also associated with the development of hypertension. These include obesity,

alcohol, dietary sodium intake, dietary potassium and
smoking.

Age
The prevelance of hypertension increases with age in
both men and women. Around 30% of the population
aged between 45 and 55 have hypertension. This number increases to approximately 70% in those over 75
years old. Factors relating to hypertension associated
with advancing age are summarized in Fig. 30.20.

Obesity
There is a continuous linear relationship between excess
body fat and blood pressure levels. Obstructive sleep apnoea is more common in, although not unique to, overweight individuals and appears to be an independent
risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Alcohol
Increased alcohol consumption is related to higher
blood pressure levels, and the effects are additive to
those of obesity.

Dietary sodium
Salt intake has a small effect on population blood pressure levels. Salt restriction may reduce systolic blood
pressure by 3–5 mmHg in hypertensives and is most
clear-cut in older subjects and those with more severe
hypertension.

Dietary potassium
Dietary sodium and potassium intake are generally inversely related. Dietary potassium may have a blood
pressure lowering effect.

Smoking
This leads to an acute elevation in blood pressure, which
subsides within 15 min of finishing a cigarette. Regular
smokers can have slightly lower blood pressures than
non-smokers, although the small potential benefit is
greatly outweighed by the increased cardiovascular
and respiratory risks.

30

Hypertension

Secondary hypertension
A definite underlying cause for hypertension is more
common in younger people, and should be looked
for specifically in those aged under 35 years:
• Renal disease: chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic
pyelonephritis, renal artery stenosis and polycystic
kidney disease. Although it only accounts for 1%
of all hypertension, the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis is important as it is the commonest curable
cause.
• Endocrine disease: Cushing’s and Conn’s syndromes,
phaeochromocytoma and acromegaly.
• Pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia: associated with oedema and proteinuria.
• Coarctation of the aorta.
• Drugs: oestrogen-containing oral contraceptive pill,
NSAIDs, steroids, sympathomimetics in cold cures,
carbenoxolone and liquorice.

History
Patients with hypertension are usually asymptomatic.
The history should concentrate on environmental predisposing factors, associated cardiovascular risk factors
and the symptoms of underlying secondary causes.
For example, patients with phaeochromocytoma may
have symptoms of panic, headache, sweating, nausea,
tremor and pallor. Accelerated hypertension may lead
to symptoms secondary to heart failure, renal failure,
headaches, nausea and vomiting, visual impairment
or fits.

polycystic kidney disease. There may be retinopathy,
classified by the Keith–Wagener changes (Fig. 30.22).

HINTS AND TIPS
In hypertension, explanation to the patient of the needs
and expectations of treatment is very important.
Patients need to understand that they are taking
treatment to reduce future risks and not to improve
current health. Work together to achieve a
combination of lifestyle changes and drug treatment
that achieves control with minimal side effects.

Examination
The clinical approach to the patient with hypertension
is summarized in Fig. 30.21 and Ch. 17. Apart from
the blood pressure itself, the examination should focus
on complications of hypertension or underlying secondary causes. The patient should be examined for left
ventricular hypertrophy, coarctation of the aorta (difference in blood pressure in the arms, weak femoral pulses,
radiofemoral delay), renal bruits for possible underlying renal artery stenosis, and palpable kidneys, e.g. in

Investigations
In all patients
The minimum tests include urinalysis and serum biochemistry for evidence of renal disease, and ECG for evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischaemia.
Consideration should also be given to the following:
• Chest radiograph: cardiac size and signs of heart
failure.

Cardiovascular system
• Fasting lipids and glucose: cardiovascular risk.
• Echocardiography: left ventricular hypertrophy and
left ventricular function.
• Fundoscopy: indicates end-organ damage.

In younger patients
Further investigations are warranted in young patients
where a secondary cause is more likely, in patients with
rapidly rising blood pressure or severe hypertension, in
patients with hypertension resistant to treatment, and in
patients with deranged U&Es. These investigations include urinary catecholamines for phaeochromocytoma
and renal tract ultrasound for structural abnormalities;
if renovascular disease is suspected, then contrast or
magnetic resonance renal arteriography is indicated.
Further investigations depend on clinical suspicion
(e.g. aortography for coarctation of the aorta).
HINTS AND TIPS
Most patients find visiting their doctor stressful and will
often have a raised blood pressure – ‘white-coat
hypertension’. A diagnosis of hypertension can
therefore only be made after ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring.

Management
NICE published guidelines on the clinical management
of primary hypertension in adults in August 2011. For
secondary hypertension, treatment of the underlying
condition may be indicated (e.g. treatment of an underlying endocrine condition or surgical correction of aortic coarctation).
An algorithm of the decision-making process in patients with hypertension is given in Fig. 17.4. The presence of other risks is crucial to proper therapy. The aim
is to reduce blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg. A
target of 130/85 mmHg is indicated in high-risk groups,
such as diabetics and patients with nephropathy.
In hypertension, as in many chronic disorders, drugs
are best added ‘stepwise’ until control has been
achieved. An attempt can then be made to ‘step down’
treatment under supervision. Monotherapy controls
blood pressure in only 30–50% of patients and most patients therefore need two or more drugs. In uncomplicated mild hypertension, drugs may be substituted
rather than added.
As a rule, it is the response to therapy rather than the
class of drugs used that is the most important factor. For
uncomplicated hypertension in the elderly, combining
thiazide diuretics with calcium channel blockers is the
recommended first choice. In specific situations, other
choices are best (e.g. ACE inhibitors in diabetes, proteinuria or heart failure).

202

It has been suggested that hypertension can be
divided into two groups: the first is renin-dependent
hypertension, most common in young white patients.
This responds better to ACE inhibitors (A) or angiotensin receptor antagonists. The second group is lowrenin hypertension that is poorly responsive to ACE
and responds better to calcium antagonists (C) or
diuretics (D).

Drug treatment
Thiazide diuretics
Thiazides lower blood pressure mainly by lowering
body sodium stores. Initially, blood pressure falls because of a decrease in blood volume, venous return
and cardiac output. Gradually, the cardiac output
returns to normal but the hypotensive effect remains because the peripheral resistance decreases. Side effects include impaired glucose tolerance and gout. Low doses
(bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg) cause little biochemical
disturbance without loss of the antihypertensive effect.
Higher doses are never usually needed, nor are potassium supplements. Thiazides are better tolerated in
women than in men and are more effective in the
elderly.

ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors act by inhibiting the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone axis with an increase in vasodilating bradykinin. They are more effective in patients with higher renin levels and so are best in young white patients versus
Afro-Caribbean patients. The indications for ACE inhibitors grow yearly as new patient groups to benefit
emerge. They are highly effective in heart failure, proteinuric nephropathy and diabetes. As such, they are now
often started as monotherapy and are very potent combined with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker.
Side effects include a dry cough, secondary to bradykinin, hyperkalaemia and a usually transient worsening
in serum creatinine (or glomerular filtration rate) as
intraglomerular pressure falls. Acute renal failure is uncommon without another pathology (e.g. bilateral renal
artery stenosis, sepsis or hypovolaemia). Monitoring of
electrolytes is essential as the dose is titrated.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers
They block the renin–angiotensin system, producing effects similar to ACE inhibitors. They are effective in conditions in which ACE inhibitors have shown benefit.
They are useful for people in whom chronic cough
limits therapy with ACE inhibitors because they do
not affect bradykinin production. There is some suggestion that they may have a cardiovascular protective effect over and above their blood pressure reduction.

Hypertension
Calcium channel blockers
Calcium antagonists are a heterogeneous group and
work in different ways on both the heart and peripheral
vasculature. The dihydropyridines (e.g. nifedipine) are
good vasodilating drugs that may cause a reflex tachycardia. Diltiazem also has negatively inotropic and
chronotropic effects. They are relatively contraindicated
in heart failure. They are effective as monotherapy in
50% of patients and amlodipine (which has demonstrated its safety in heart failure) has become the most
common antihypertensive worldwide. Side effects include flushing, headache, oedema and constipation.
The oedema does not respond to diuretics.

Potassium-sparing diuretics
Potassium-sparing diuretics may be used for the prophylaxis or treatment of diuretic-induced hypokalaemia.
They are now also indicated as a ‘step 4’ medication
in treatment-resistant hypertension.

Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers were until relatively recently part of the
‘ABCD’ approach to managing hypertension. In the
recent NICE guidelines they have fallen out of favour
and are now only recommended in the management
of hypertension in the very young or as a ‘step 4’ agent
in treatment-resistant hypertension. Beta-blockers
initially produce a fall in blood pressure by decreasing
cardiac output. With continued treatment, the cardiac
output returns to normal but the blood pressure remains low because the peripheral resistance is ‘reset’
at a lower level and renin levels are reduced.
Side effects include negative inotropism, provocation of asthma and heart block. Less serious side effects
include cold hands and fatigue.

Alpha adrenergic receptor blockers
Alpha-blockers reduce both arteriolar and venous resistance, and maintain a high cardiac output.

Central acting agents
Methyldopa stimulates alpha-2 receptors in the medulla
and reduces sympathetic outflow. In 20% of patients it
causes a positive Coombs’ test and, rarely, haemolytic
anaemia. Drug-induced hepatitis with fever may also
occur.

Vasodilators
Minoxidil is a potent vasodilator and decreases peripheral resistance. It may cause a reflex tachycardia, which
can be prevented by combination with a beta-blocker.
It may also cause fluid retention, which responds to a
diuretic, and hirsutism. This is its other therapeutic
use for men.

30

Management of accelerated (‘malignant’)
hypertension
Malignant hypertension or very severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure >140 mmHg) requires urgent
treatment in hospital. Treatment is normally given
orally with beta-blockers or calcium antagonists to
reduce diastolic blood pressure to 100–110 mmHg
within the first 24 h. Over the next few days, further
antihypertensives should be given to lower blood
pressure further.
Very rapid falls in blood pressure should be avoided
because the reduction in cerebral perfusion may lead to
cerebral infarction, blindness, worsening renal function
and myocardial ischaemia. Intravenous antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside, GTN or labetalol are
rarely required. Sublingual nifedipine is best avoided
because of its unpredictable response.

Management of hypertension in pregnancy
Good blood pressure control in pregnancy is important
– oral methyldopa is safe. Beta-blockers are effective and
safe in the third trimester; labetalol is used relatively frequently, but may cause intrauterine growth retardation
when used earlier in pregnancy. Hydralazine may also
be used. Its side effects include drug-induced lupus.

Follow-up
Concordance with treatment is an important issue in a
chronic, asymptomatic condition such as hypertension,
where treatment is aimed at reduction of later complications; 25–50% of patients default or discontinue treatment, so an effective recall system is needed. When
the blood pressure is satisfactorily controlled, it should
be checked once a year. More frequent checks are
needed during dose titration if the control is borderline,
if compliance is a problem or if the treatment regimen is
complex. On routine visits, the blood pressure and
weight should be measured and the patient should be
asked about side effects. The urine should be checked
for protein and glucose yearly.
Apart from this, routine re-examination or investigation is unnecessary and should only be performed
if there is a special indication (e.g. variable or borderline
blood pressure control, or at the onset of new
symptoms).

Prognosis
Patients with untreated malignant hypertension have a
90% mortality in 1 year, and treatment is therefore lifesaving. The risk of hypertension in other cases depends
on the level of blood pressure, the presence of complications (e.g. cardiac or renal failure) and the presence of

203

Cardiovascular system
other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. male sex, smoking,
diabetes and older age). Those at highest risk gain most
benefit from treatment.

VALVULAR HEART DISEASE AND
HEART MURMURS

Introduction
Valvular heart disease is any disease that affects any of
the four heart valves. It is a common condition that
may be congenital or acquired. Clinically most heart
valve abnormalities are asymptomatic and only discovered by the presence of a heart murmur on careful auscultation of the precordium. Heart murmurs are due to
vibration caused by turbulent blood flow within the
heart. The commonest causes in examinations and real
clinical practice are left-sided valvular heart disease and
tricuspid regurgitation. Non-valvular causes include:
• Innocent ‘flow’ murmurs, especially in children.
• High cardiac output states, e.g. pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis and fever.
• Congenital heart disease, e.g. atrial septal defect
(ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus
arteriosus (PDA) and coarctation of the aorta.
The classification of heart murmurs includes ejection
systolic murmurs, pansystolic murmurs, diastolic murmurs and continuous murmurs.

Mitral stenosis
The cause of mitral stenosis is usually rheumatic fever,
although only approximately half of all patients give a
positive history. It is four times more common than mitral regurgitation in rheumatic fever and is more common in women than in men.
Progressive stenosis of the mitral valve, via thickening of the cusps and fusion of the commissures, results
in a pressure gradient between the left atrium and the
left ventricle. As the stenosis worsens, ventricular filling
becomes impaired, and this is compounded by fibrosis
of the subvalvar apparatus leading to left atrial dilatation and hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation and thrombus
formation. Pulmonary congestion ensues as left atrial
pressure rises, and an increase in pulmonary artery pressure may lead to right heart failure.

Clinical features
Dyspnoea on exertion is an early symptom and may
progress to orthopnoea and PND. Breathlessness often
worsens considerably with the onset of atrial fibrillation
(loss of atrial systole) and is often accompanied by palpitations. Cough and haemoptysis may occur because

204

of bronchitis, pulmonary infarction, pulmonary congestion and bronchial vein rupture. Systemic emboli
may occur in patients, particularly in atrial fibrillation.
Fatigue and cold extremities are late symptoms, probably secondary to a low cardiac output. Chest pain occurs
in a few people and may be due to coronary artery embolism or severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient
may have coexistent coronary artery disease. On examination the patient may have a malar flush. The pulse
may be low volume and irregular (AF). The apex beat
will non-displaced and tapping. On auscultation there
will be a loud S1 opening snap followed by a middiastolic rumbling murmur, heard best in expiration.
A summary of the clinical signs of mitral stenosis are
given in Fig. 30.23.

Management
Maintenance of sinus rhythm confers haemodynamic
benefit as ventricular filling is improved. Cardioversion
should be considered if atrial fibrillation is present and
the chamber dimensions are favourable. Anticoagulation is indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation although some would anticoagulate all patients with
mitral stenosis. The risk of emboli is greater with a large
left atrium or left atrial appendage.
It may be necessary to add in other rate-controlling
drugs such as beta-blockers or verapamil.
If symptoms persist, the patient should be considered for mitral valve replacement or valvotomy. If the
valve is not calcified and the leaflets are pliable, balloon
valvuloplasty may be attempted.

Mitral regurgitation
The incidence of mitral regurgitation is equal in men
and women. It is usually secondary to rheumatic fever,
floppy prolapsing mitral valve leaflets, papillary muscle
dysfunction, rupture after an inferior MI, cardiomyopathy, or ventricular dilatation or dysfunction. Less common causes include congenital malformations, which
may be associated with an ostium primum atrial septal
defect, infective endocarditis, rupture of the chordae
tendineae, cardiomyopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, or
left atrial tumour interfering with mitral valve closure.
The circulatory changes depend on the speed of onset
and severity of mitral regurgitation. Acute regurgitation
may lead to acute pulmonary oedema, whereas chronic
regurgitation allows for compensatory left ventricular
and atrial dilatation.

Clinical features
Progressive exertional dyspnoea, palpitations and fatigue are common, with symptoms of pulmonary oedema if severe. Atrial fibrillation, systemic emboli and

examination the apex beat may be displaced and hyperdynamic. There will be a pansystolic murmur radiating
to the axilla. A summary of the clinical signs of mitral
regurgitation are given in Fig. 30.24.

Management
Diuretics are used for pulmonary congestion, and vasodilators are helpful in acute regurgitation. Digoxin and
anticoagulants are given to patients in atrial fibrillation.
Mitral valve replacement is indicated if symptoms are
severe and uncontrolled by medical treatment, or if
pulmonary hypertension develops. Good results are
achieved if left ventricular function is preserved, and
early referral may allow repair of the valve rather than
replacement.

and is three times commoner in women. Mitral valve
prolapse is associated with Turner’s syndrome, Marfan’s
syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects.

Clinical features
This condition is often asymptomatic and found incidentally. An apical midsystolic click is heard, associated
with a late systolic murmur if the valve is regurgitant. It
may be associated with palpitations and atypical chest
pain, although the latter is more common in people
aware of their condition. Systemic emboli and syncope
are rare.
The ECG may show inferolateral ST/T segment
changes. Arrhythmias may be confirmed by Holter monitoring and the commonest rhythm disturbance is
ventricular extrasystoles. Echocardiography is diagnostic.

Mitral valve prolapse
This is due to prolapse of the mitral valve leaflets into
the left atrium during ventricular systole. Prolapse is
common in floppy valves and myocardial disease, and
should be distinguished from benign mitral prolapse
syndrome. It may affect up to 5% of the population

Management
Treatment is only indicated for complications (e.g. antiarrhythmic drugs for significant rhythm disturbances,
or anticoagulants for emboli).

• Osteogenesis imperfecta: blue sclera

Aortic stenosis
The commonest cause of aortic stenosis under the age of
65 is a calcified bicuspid valve, and this is more common in men. In younger patients, the cause may be congenital or due to rheumatic fever. In patients over 65 the
commonest cause is senile calcific aortic stenosis, which
is commoner in women. Aortic stenosis tends to progress gradually, causing obstruction to the left ventricular outflow with resultant hypertrophy. Ventricular
dilatation and heart failure are late complications. Conduction defects may result from calcification extending
into the ventricular system.

the patient may have a slow rising pulse with narrow
pulse pressures. The apex beat is non-displaced and a
left ventricular heave may be palpable. On auscultation
there is a ejection systolic murmur radiating to the carotids. Occasionally the stenosis is so severe that minimal flow causes no murmur. A summary of the clinical
signs in aortic stenosis are given in Fig. 30.25.
Aortic sclerosis is a distinctly different condition secondary to senile degeneration of the aortic valve. Clinically it does result in an ejection systolic murmur, but
this does not radiate to the carotid artery; nor does it
cause a change in the character of the pulse.

Clinical features

Management

Initially the patient may be asymptomatic. Classically
late symptoms are angina pectoris, exertional dyspnoea
and syncope. Sudden death may occur, probably secondary to ventricular dysrhythmias. On examination

Valve replacement is indicated for severe stenosis because of the risk of sudden death, or for symptomatic
aortic stenosis. Valve replacement surgery can either
be open or, more recently, by means of transcatheter

• Ankylosing spondylitis.
• Reiter’s syndrome.
• Psoriatic arthropathy.
• Aortic wall disease due to dilatation (e.g. hypertension with or without dissection).

Clinical features
The patient is usually asymptomatic until the ventricle
fails, giving rise to symptoms of heart failure. Angina
rarely occurs. Clinical signs in aortic regurgitation are
given in Fig. 30.26. The pulse has a sharp rise and fall
(‘collapsing’ or ‘water hammer’) with a wide pulse pressure. Other manifestations of this are visible pulsation
in the nail bed (Quincke’s sign), visible arterial pulsation in the neck (Corrigan’s sign), head bobbing (de
Musset’s sign), ‘pistol shot’ femoral artery sound
(Traube’s sign) and a diastolic murmur following distal
compression of the artery (Duroziez’s sign).

Management
Severe stenosis indicated by
— Slow rising pulse
— Narrow pulse pressure
— LVH
— Thrill
— Longer duration of murmur
i.e. NOT by the intensity of the murmur. This
becomes quieter as the LV fails and LVF becomes apparent

aortic valve implantation (TAVI). It should be done
whilst left ventricular function is preserved. The management of asymptomatic moderate stenosis (i.e. surgery versus medical therapy) is uncertain. Drugs do
not alter the progression of the disease, although diuretics and digoxin can be given for heart failure. Many
cardiovascular drugs are contraindicated in aortic stenosis; these are predominantly vasodilating medications.
The decrease in systemic vascular resistance increases
the gradient across the valve, increasing the work the
ventricle has to perform.

Aortic regurgitation
The more common causes include cusp malformation
(e.g. bicuspid valve) and cusp erosion (e.g. infective
endocarditis).

Valve replacement is indicated for symptomatic patients.
In the meantime, diuretics and digoxin may be given to
control symptoms of heart failure. The prognosis is good
while ventricular function is good, but death usually occurs within 2–3 years after the onset of ventricular failure.

Tricuspid regurgitation
This may be functional secondary to right heart failure,
commonly as a result of pulmonary hypertension. It
may also be rheumatic in association with mitral valve
disease, or due to endocarditis in intravenous drug users.

Clinical features
These can include fatigue, oedema, ascites and hepatic
pain as the liver capsule is stretched. On examination
there may be giant ‘v’ waves in the JVP. There may be
a right ventricular heave. A pansystolic murmur will
be audible at the lower sternal edge, best heard on inspiration. The clinical findings of tricuspid regurgitation
are summarized in Fig. 30.27.

Management
Treat any underlying cause, then treat the consequences
of right heart failure with diuretics, digoxin and ACE inhibitors. Valve replacement is an option but is often
high risk (20% mortality) if pulmonary hypertension
is present.

Miscellaneous cardiovascular conditions

Pulmonary valve lesions
Pulmonary valve lesions are least common. Pulmonary
stenosis is often congenital and associated with, for example, Noonan’s syndrome. It is also one of the features
of Fallot’s tetralogy. Pulmonary regurgitation is caused
by any cause of pulmonary hypertension and causes a
Graham Steell murmur.
HINTS AND TIPS
Left-sided heart murmurs are loudest in expiration and
right-sided murmurs loudest in inspiration due to
increased blood flow across the valves.

HINTS AND TIPS
There are four things to remember when describing a
murmur:
(i) Where is it loudest on the praecordium?
(ii) Where is it in the cardiac cycle?
(iii) What happens on inspiration and expiration?
(iv) Where does it radiate to?

MISCELLANEOUS
CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS

Pericarditis and pericardial
effusion
Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium which
may be primary or secondary to systemic disease. Common causes include viruses (e.g. EBV, Coxsackie or
HIV), bacteria (e.g. TB), myocardial infarction (Dressler’s syndrome), autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or SLE and drugs such as hydralazine
or radiotherapy (Fig. 30.28).

30

Fig. 30.28 Causes of pericarditis.

Idiopathic
Infections – viral (e.g. Coxsackie virus B), bacterial (e.g.
Mycobacterium), parasitic
Neoplastic (e.g. breast, lung, lymphoma)
Connective tissue disease (e.g. SLE, RA)
Uraemia
Myocardial infarction
Dressler’s syndrome following myocardial infarction or
cardiac surgery
Radiotherapy
Trauma
Hypothyroidism
RA, rheumatoid arthritis; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

Chest X-ray
This is usually normal. If there is an associated pericardial effusion, the heart appears large and globular.
In addition to ECG and CXR, the following investigations should be considered:
• Blood and sputum culture for bacteria.
• Viral titres and viral culture from throat swabs and
stools.
• Autoantibodies if there is evidence of connective
tissue disease.
• TFTs.

Management
The underlying cause is treated. NSAIDs relieve pain.
Clinical features of an associated pericardial effusion
include signs of left and right heart failure. Pericardial
tamponade means that the intrapericardial pressure increases, with reduced right heart filling and hypotension
from reduced cardiac output. Clinically, there is hypotension, Kussmaul’s sign (the JVP increases on inspiration) and muffled heart sounds (Beck’s triad), plus
pulsus paradoxus and tachycardia. The ECG may show
low-amplitude QRS complexes with electrical alternans.
Echocardiography is diagnostic. Management is by
pericardiocentesis.

Clinical features
Symptoms include a sharp retrosternal pain relieved by
sitting forward. It may radiate to the left arm, or inferiorly. It is worse on lying down, with inspiration and
coughing. There may be a ‘scratchy’ friction rub on examination. Pericardial effusion may be present.

Investigations
Electrocardiography
This shows concave (saddle-shaped) upwards ST-segment elevation, often with PR-segment depression.
Inverted T waves may also occur.

Constrictive pericarditis
This is usually idiopathic or secondary to tuberculosis,
although it may follow any cause of pericarditis. The
heart is encased within a non-expansile pericardium.
Clinically the signs are of right heart failure with ascites,
hepatomegaly and a raised JVP. There may be pulsus
paradoxus and hypotension, and auscultation reveals
a pericardial ‘knock’ due to an abrupt end to ventricular
filling. The CXR may show pericardial calcification.
Management is by pericardiectomy if constriction is
severe.

Remember the causes of pericarditis by the mnemonic
CARDIAC RIND: Collagen vascular disease, Aortic
aneurysm, Radiation, Drugs, Infections, Acute renal

Cardiomyopathy
Cardiomyopathy is a disorder of heart muscle. It is classified into three types as hypertrophic, dilated and restrictive. Fig. 30.29 gives examples of aetiology.

Hypertrophic/obstructive cardiomyopathy
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM) follows an autosomal dominant inheritance, although half of all
cases occur sporadically. There is asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, usually of the intraventricular
septum.

Clinical features
Symptoms of HOCM are dyspnoea, angina, palpitations, syncope. On examination, there is a jerky pulse,
the apex beat has a double impulse, there may be third
and fourth heart sounds, and there is a harsh ejection
systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal edge when

upright or performing a Valsalva manoeuvre. There may
also be associated mitral regurgitation.
HOCM may be complicated by atrial fibrillation, systemic emboli, heart failure and sudden death, the risk of
which is probably increased by strenuous exercise.

Investigation
Electrocardiography shows left ventricular hypertrophy
and sometimes atrial fibrillation, LBBB or ventricular ectopics. The classic echocardiography finding is asymmetrical septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior
movement of the mitral valve. 24-h ECG monitoring
may identify silent arrhythmias, which are often transient, e.g. PAF or VT. Cardiac catheterization shows a
small left ventricular cavity with obliteration in systole.
There is a systolic outflow tract gradient within the
ventricle.

Management
Beta-blockers or verapamil help with symptoms and are
useful for angina or dysrhythmias. Some treat dysrhythmias prophylactically with amiodarone; implantable
defibrillators may be indicated. The patient should be
anticoagulated if there is atrial fibrillation. If medical
treatment is ineffective, the patient should be considered for dual-chamber pacemaker, septal myomectomy,
myotomy or cardiac transplantation. Screening of firstdegree relatives may be indicated as HOCM is a risk for
sudden death in young people.

Dilated cardiomyopathy
The ventricles are dilated and contract poorly. There are
a number of possible heterogeneous causes, which include alcohol, infiltrative disorders, collagen diseases,
infective, toxic, metabolic, postpartum and genetic conditions. However, IHD remains the leading UK cause.

Clinical features
There are usually signs and symptoms of right and left
heart failure, cardiomegaly and atrial fibrillation with
emboli. Patients may have a permanent tachycardia
with a low blood pressure. The apex beat may be diffuse,
with an S3 gallop rhythm and potential mitral and/or
tricuspid valve regurgitation. More dangerous arrhythmias and conduction defects occur.
Echocardiography shows a globally hypokinetic and
dilated heart. Coronary arteriography is usually normal.

Management
Underlying conditions are treated as appropriate. Heart
failure should be treated as for ischaemic cardiomyopathy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, etc. Anticoagulants
and maintenance of sinus rhythm to reduce the risk of
emboli are standard. The prognosis is variable. Patients
should be considered for cardiac transplantation. The
mortality of this condition is 40% at 2 years.

30

Miscellaneous cardiovascular conditions

Restrictive/infiltrative cardiomyopathy
This is due to endomyocardial stiffening and includes
fibroplastic and infiltrative conditions as shown in
Fig. 30.29. The commonest cause in the UK is amyloidosis. It results in impaired diastolic function. Clinically
restrictive cardiomyopathy presents with features of right
ventricular failure. The ECG may show small voltage
complexes. The differential diagnosis includes constrictive pericarditis. Myocardial biopsy may be indicated.
Treatment is that of the cause.

Infective endocarditis
Infective endocarditis is an illness caused by microbial
infection of the cardiac valves or endocardium. The annual incidence in the UK is approximately 7 in 10 000.
It follows invasion of the bloodstream by microorganisms from the mouth, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, respiratory tract or skin. Platelets adhere to
endothelial breaks and form ‘vegetations’, which are
then colonized by circulating bacteria. Common sites
of infection are bicuspid aortic valves and mitral valves,
with prolapse and regurgitation.
Risk factors for infective endocarditis are abnormal
or prosthetic heart valves (although 50% of cases
occur on normal valves), intravenous drug use and
immuncompromise.
Streptococcus viridans is the commonest pathogen;
others include Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus
and Staphylococcus epidermidis, especially in intravenous
drug users.

Clinical features and complications
The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient with fever and a new or changing heart murmur. The clinical
features are:
• Infection: malaise and lassitude, sweats, myalgia, arthralgia, weight loss, finger clubbing, anaemia and
splenomegaly. Fever is often low grade.
• Heart disease: listen for murmurs. In tricuspid endocarditis the patient may be murmur-free. The patient
may present with embolic pneumonia, pleurisy or
haemoptysis, or later with a raised venous pressure,
jaundice and a pulsatile liver.
• Embolism: this is the most common cause of death
in endocarditis. Most emboli are sterile but large
fungal mycelia may embolize.
• Immunological phenomena: examples include vasculitic skin lesions, splinter haemorrhages, Roth
spots in the retina and Osler’s nodes. They are classic
signs of infective endocarditis but are often absent in
cases detected relatively early.
• Urine: this is normal in uncomplicated endocarditis.
There may be mild proteinuria resulting from fever,
or haematuria as a result of embolism with infarction.

Fig. 30.30 Duke criteria for the diagnosis of infective
endocarditis.

Major
criteria

Positive blood culture
Typical organism in 2 separate blood
cultures
Persistently positive blood culture
Endocardium involvement
Positive echocardiogram (vegetation,
dehiscence of prosthetic valve, abscess)
New valvular regurgitation

Minor
criteria

Predisposition (e.g. mechanical valve)
Fever >38 C
Vascular/immunological signs (e.g. splinter
haemorrhage)
Positive blood culture that does not meet
major criteria
Positive echocardiogram that does not
meet major criteria

For a diagnosis of infective endocarditis the patient must meet
either 2 major criteria or 1 major with 3 minor criteria or all 5 minor
criteria

Investigations
Blood cultures
Numerous sets of blood cultures from different sites at
different times are the essential investigation. Positive
blood cultures are part of the diagnostic criteria
(Fig. 30.30).

Inflammatory markers
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP and white cell
count are usually raised. There is a normochromic normocytic anaemia.

Chest X-ray
A CXR with right-sided endocarditis may show multiple
shadows due to an embolic pneumonia with infarction.

Electrocardiography
The ECG may show changes of MI due to coronary embolism, or conduction defect due to the development of
an aortic root abscess.

Echocardiography
Echocardiography may show vegetations or paravalvular abscess formation. A negative transthoracic echo
does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis; transoesophageal echocardiography is preferred.

Management
Antibiotics
When there is a high degree of suspicion treatment
should be started after blood has been taken for culture
but before obtaining confirmation of a positive culture,

211

Cardiovascular system
because valve destruction can occur rapidly and vegetations may grow and embolize.
Patients with endocarditis require a prolonged
course of intravenous antibiotics. The exact regime
depends on the positive cultures plus local resistance
patterns. Benzylpenicillin and gentamicin plus flucloxacillin, if Staphylococcus aureus is suspected, is good empirical therapy. If the likelihood of penicillin resistance
is high, vancomycin should be given.

Surgery
This is needed for haemodynamic complications with
acute severe valvular regurgitation, for valve obstruction
by vegetations, for intractable heart failure, for cardiac
abscess formation and for resistant infections.

The role of antibiotic prophylaxis
Recent NICE guidelines (March 2008) have suggested a
change in practice. At-risk patients (i.e. mechanical
valve, known valvular heart disease, previous IE) no
longer receive prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures, GI or genitourinary surgery, bronchoscopy or
ENT procedures.

Culture-negative endocarditis
Possible causes of culture-negative endocarditis are
given in Fig. 30.31. The addition of broad-spectrum
antifungal therapy is indicated if continuing sepsis
is likely.
HINTS AND TIPS
Symptoms in infective endocarditis may be very nonspecific in older patients. They may complain just of
tiredness or weight loss. Maintain a high degree of
suspicion in patients found to have cardiac murmurs.

Rheumatic fever
Acute rheumatic fever is a multisystem immune disease
following infection with a group A beta-haemolytic
streptococcus. Antibodies generated against the bacteria
also bind to and damage valvular tissue. The multisystem involvement reflects the vasculitic nature of the

underlying disease. It is rare in the developed world because of use of antibiotics for pharyngeal infection. It
usually affects children aged 5–15 years but no age or
race is immune. Risk factors include crowding and
low socioeconomic status.
The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is based on
clinical findings organized by the Jones criteria. The
presence of two major or one major and two minor criteria indicates a high probability of rheumatic fever
(Fig. 30.32). Evidence of a preceding streptococcal infection greatly strengthens the diagnosis of rheumatic
fever.

Major Jones criteria for rheumatic fever
Carditis (40–50%)
There may be myocarditis (tachypnoea, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema), endocarditis (listen regularly for transient murmurs – the mitral valve is most commonly
affected), or pericarditis (friction rub, effusion). It is
more evident in children and may be asymptomatic
or result in death in the acute stage, and it can lead to
heart failure and chronic valvular heart disease (the classic exam cause of mitral stenosis).

Arthritis (80%)
This is the most common major criterion and usually
presents as migratory joint pain affecting larger joints.
The onset is sudden with signs of inflammation and
limitation of movement. It responds well to antiinflammatory drugs and rarely leaves any residual deformity. Symptoms last for 3–6 weeks.

Fig. 30.32 Revised Jones criteria for guidance in the
diagnosis of rheumatic fever.

Major
criteria

Polyarthritis
Carditis
Chorea
Erythema marginatum
Subcutaneous nodules

Minor
criteria

Fever
Arthralgia
Previous rheumatic fever or rheumatic
heart disease
Raised acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP,
WCC)
Prolonged PR interval in ECG

For a diagnosis of rheumatic fever, there must also be supporting
evidence of preceding streptococcal infection (i.e. increased
antistreptolysin O or other streptococcal antibodies, positive throat
culture for group A streptococcus, or recent scarlet fever). CRP,
C-reactive protein; ECG, electrocardiogram; ESR, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate; WCC, white cell count.

Miscellaneous cardiovascular conditions
Sydenham’s chorea (10%)
Movements are choreoathetoid and involuntary, involving mainly the face and limbs, and may be unilateral. It is associated with emotional lability. There can
be a latent period of 2–6 months. Symptoms last for approximately 6 months. It is commoner in girls. There
may be no other signs of rheumatic fever.

Erythema marginatum (5%)
This is a painless rash appearing as large, pink macules
that spread quickly to give a serpiginous edge with a fading centre.

Subcutaneous nodules (rare)
These are round, firm and painless, ranging from 0.5 to
2 cm. They are mobile and occur mainly over bony
prominences.

Diagnosis of streptococcal infection
Evidence of recent streptococcal infection should be
sought and is indicated by a positive throat swab, increased antistreptolysin O or anti-DNAse B titres or recent scarlet fever.

Management
Anti-inflammatory drugs relieve the pain and swelling
of joints and possibly the later development of valvular
heart disease. Treatment is usually for a prolonged
period of time (months).
Aspirin or a short course of corticosteroids in severe
carditis are the drugs of choice. They reduce the arthritis,
although evidence of their effectiveness in changing
overall disease progression is lacking. Diazepam is given
to control choreiform movements. Intramuscular penicillin G is given in the acute stages and is followed by
continued penicillin.

Prognosis
The initial mortality rate is low at 1%. The long-term risk
is of structural valve disease, both stenosis and regurgitation. The mitral and pulmonary valves are the most
and least affected valves, respectively. Standard management of valve disease applies.

Atrial myxoma
These are rare, benign, primary tumours, usually in the
left atrium, which are twice as common in women as
men. They present with vague symptoms (e.g. fever,
weight loss, general malaise, atrial fibrillation, left atrial
obstruction or systemic emboli). Auscultation may
reveal a diastolic ‘tumour plop’. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is characteristically raised. They are diagnosed by echocardiography and treatment is by surgical
excision.

30

Congenital heart disease in adults
Introduction
Congenital heart disease is any defect of the heart present at the time of birth. The disease may cause impairment of flow, contraction or electrical conduction.
Broadly speaking, congenital heart disease affecting
blood flow can be divided into acyanotic (left-to-right
shunt) or cyanotic (right-to-left shunt).

Acyanotic conditions
Atrial septal defect
Atrial septal defect (ASD) accounts for 10% of congenital heart defects and is more common in women than
in men. There are two types: ostium secundum (the
more common type) and ostium primum. The communication between the atria allows for left-to-right atrial
shunting. Atrial arrhythmias are common. In ostium
primum defects, there may be involvement of the mitral
and tricuspid valves producing regurgitation.
Most patients are asymptomatic; a few have dyspnoea and weakness. The patient may have palpitations
secondary to atrial arrhythmias, and right heart failure
may develop later in life. Auscultation reveals wide,
fixed splitting of the second heart sound. The increased
right heart output gives rise to a pulmonary systolic flow
murmur. There may be a tricuspid diastolic flow murmur with large defects. There may be a left parasternal
heave of right ventricular hypertrophy.
On ECG, there may be evidence of atrial arrhythmias
(e.g. atrial fibrillation). In ostium secundum defects,
there may be right axis deviation and right ventricular
hypertrophy. In ostium primum defects, there is RBBB,
left axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.
Chest radiography shows prominent pulmonary arteries and the lung fields are plethoric. The right atrium
and ventricles are enlarged. Echocardiography reveals
dilatation of the right-sided cardiac chambers. Doppler
studies allow visualization of the left-to-right shunt
across the atrial septum. Cardiac catheterization demonstrates a step-up in oxygen saturation at the right
atrial level due to shunting of oxygenated blood from
the left atrium to the right atrium. The catheter can be
directed across the defect into the left atrium.

Ventricular septal defect
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common
congenital heart lesion, accounting for approximately
one-third of all malformations. Blood moves from the
high-pressure left ventricle to the right ventricle. If the
defect is large, pulmonary flow increases, leading to
obliterative pulmonary vascular changes and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. The pulmonary
arterial pressure may then equal the systemic pressure,

213

Cardiovascular system
reducing or reversing the shunt, and central cyanosis
may develop (Eisenmenger’s syndrome).
A small defect (maladie de Roger) may cause no
symptoms but there is a loud pansystolic murmur at
the left sternal edge; it may close spontaneously. Larger
VSDs produce dyspnoea and fatigue, and the pulse volume may be decreased. The apex beat is prominent as a
result of left ventricular hypertrophy, and there may be a
left parasternal heave if there is right ventricular hypertrophy with pulmonary hypertension. There is a thrill at
the left sternal edge, as well as a pansystolic murmur in
the same place. A mitral diastolic flow murmur implies
a large shunt.
ECG can show no changes in small VSDs and features
of right and left ventricular hypertrophy. Chest X-ray may
be normal if the defect is small. Prominent pulmonary
arteries are present in pulmonary hypertension. There
may be left atrial and ventricular enlargement. Echocardiography is diagnostic if the defect can be imaged.
Doppler studies identify abnormal flow across the septum. Cardiac catheterization will show a step-up in oxygen saturation at the right ventricular level due to
shunting of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to
the right ventricle. Left ventricular angiography produces
opacification of the right ventricle through the defect.
Moderate and large defects should be closed surgically to prevent pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger’s syndrome.

Patent ductus arteriosus
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) accounts for approximately 10% of congenital heart defects and is more
common in women. The ductus arteriosus connects
the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta but
should close off at birth. Because the aortic pressure is
higher than the pulmonary artery pressure throughout
the cardiac cycle, the PDA produces continuous shunting from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, leading to
increased pulmonary venous return to the left heart
and an increased left ventricular volume load.
There are usually no symptoms. Large defects lead to
left ventricular failure with dyspnoea. The pulse is
collapsing. There may be left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a continuous ‘machinery’ murmur with systolic
accentuation loudest in the first or second left intercostal space.
Electrocardiography shows features of left atrial and
left ventricular hypertrophy and on chest X-ray the aorta
and pulmonary arteries are prominent. The lung fields
are plethoric. At echocardiography, there is dilatation of
the left-sided cardiac chambers and Doppler studies identify the abnormal flow across the ductus. Cardiac catheterization demonstrates a step-up in oxygen saturation at
pulmonary artery level. The catheter can sometimes be
passed across the ductus into the descending aorta.

214

Indometacin given within the first few days of birth
may stimulate duct closure by inhibiting prostaglandin
synthesis. If this fails, the duct can be ligated surgically
or with an umbrella occlusion device.

Aortic coarctation
This accounts for 5–7% of congenital heart defects. It is
twice as common in men and is associated with Turner’s
syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome and berry aneurysms.
There is a narrowing of the aorta at or just distal to
the ductus arteriosus; the vast majority are distal to
the origin of the left subclavian artery. The condition
is a cause of secondary hypertension. It encourages
the formation of a collateral arterial circulation involving the intercostal arteries. In 30% of patients, there is
an associated bicuspid aortic valve.
In adults, the condition is often asymptomatic until
long-standing hypertension becomes apparent. When
present, symptoms include headache, left ventricular
failure, stroke and endocarditis. On examination, the
femoral pulses are weak or absent and there is radiofemoral delay. The upper limbs may be hypertensive or
have unequal blood pressure, and the lower limbs have
a low pressure. There may be features of left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is a mid- or late systolic murmur
over the upper praecordium or back due to turbulent
flow through the coarctation. Collateral murmurs
may be heard over the scapulae and there may be an aortic systolic murmur of an associated bicuspid valve.
There may be left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG,
and chest radiography shows tortuous and dilated collaterals that may erode the undersurface of the ribs to
produce ‘rib notching’. There may be a double aortic
knuckle due to stenosis and poststenotic dilatation. Cardiomegaly may indicate left ventricular enlargement.
MRI and aortography confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment is by surgical resection. Angioplasty is an
alternative.

Aortic and pulmonary stenosis
Aortic stenosis and its clinical features and management
has been covered previously in this chapter. The commonest congenital abnormality is a bicuspid valve
(1–2%) which results in chronic turbulent flow resulting in calcification of the leaflets. Supravalvular aortic
stenosis is also associated with Williams syndrome.
Pulmonary stenosis is rare and often asymptomatic
until severe when symptoms include exertional dyspnoea, light-headednessand and eventually symptoms
of right heart failure. It is associated with Noonan’s syndrome and Alagille syndrome. In general, invasive intervention is recommended, and often valvotomy is very
effective.

This represents 6–10% of cases of congenital heart disease. The four features comprising the tetrad are as
follows:
• VSD.
• Right ventricular outflow obstruction (pulmonary
stenosis – infundibular or valvar).
• The aorta is positioned over the ventricular septum
(‘overriding aorta’).
• Right ventricular hypertrophy.
Because there is right ventricular outflow obstruction,
the shunt through the VSD is from right to left. This results in central cyanosis.
Children may present with deep cyanosis and syncope. Squatting helps to decrease the right-to-left shunt
by increasing systemic resistance. Signs include cyanosis
and finger clubbing. There is a parasternal heave and
systolic murmur in the pulmonary area (second left intercostal space), P2 is soft or absent, and there may be
growth retardation.
ECG features include right atrial and ventricular hypertrophy. The heart is boot-shaped (‘coeur en sabot’)
and the pulmonary artery is small with oligaemic lung
fields. Echocardiography can be diagnostic but it may
be necessary to proceed to cardiac catheterization studies to confirm the diagnosis. Look for the horizontal
thoracotomy scar towards either axilla.
Management is by total surgical correction. There are
palliative procedures for the very young as holding measures (e.g. the Blalock shunt, which produces an anastomosis between a subclavian artery and a pulmonary
artery to increase pulmonary blood flow).

RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Definition
Respiratory failure is defined as a dysfunction of gas exchange resulting in abnormalities of oxygenation or
ventilation (carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination) severe
enough to impair or threaten the function of vital organs such as the brain and heart.
Respiratory failure is said to be present in a patient
breathing air at sea level when the PO2 is less than
8.0 kPa. If hypoxia is combined with a normal or low
PCO2 (<6.0 kPa), this is type I respiratory failure. The
primary cause for type I respiratory failure is ventila_ mismatch. When hypoxia is com_ Q)
tion/perfusion (V=
bined with a raised PCO2, type II respiratory failure is
present. The underlying cause for type II respiratory fail_
_ Q)
ure is alveolar hypoventilation, with or without (V=
mismatch. Measurement of the arterial blood gases
(ABGs) is thus essential to the diagnosis of respiratory
failure.
In a healthy subject a rise in arterial PCO2 causes an increase in ventilation by central stimulation of the respiratory centres in the medulla, resulting in an increase
in minute ventilation to lower PCO2. In type II respiratory
failure, this mechanism fails and there is effective alveolar
hypoventilation from one of several causes.
Clinical features of respiratory failure can be thought
of as those due to hypoxaemia (present in both type I
and II) and those due to hypercapnia (type II). Hypoxia
causes dyspnoea, restlessness, central cyanosis and
eventually impaired consciousness. Hypercapnia causes
headache, tachycardia with bounding pulse, tremor,
clouding of consciousness and, rarely, papilloedema.

Type I respiratory failure
Causes
This is hypoxaemia without CO2 retention. Physiological causes include:
• A low inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2), e.g. at
high altitude.
_ mismatch through, for example, a right-to-left
_ Q
• V=
shunt
In medical practice, the common causes of type I respiratory failure include:

Pneumonia.
Asthma.
COPD (predominantly emphysema – ‘pink puffers’).
Pulmonary thromboembolism.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Pulmonary oedema.

Investigations
Blood tests
• Full blood count; look for anaemia, polycythaemia,

Respiratory disease
Other tests
• Sputum microbiology.
• Spirometry.

Management
The main therapeutic objective in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure is to ensure oxygen delivery to vital organs.
Severe hypoxia is life-threatening and oxygen therapy is
indicated to maintain saturations of >92% (>8 kPa).
The patient may be cyanosed, confused and delirious.
While high concentrations of inspired oxygen (FiO2
>50%) are safe in patients with type I respiratory failure, pulmonary oxygen toxicity is a risk if the FiO2
concentration remains over 60% for more than 48 h
continuously.
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via a
face mask can improve oxygenation and allow intubation to be avoided.
Therapeutic objectives include:
• Specific therapy of the underlying cause (e.g. antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia, bronchodilators
and steroids for asthma, or chest drain insertion
for pneumothorax).
• General supportive care: adequate hydration, nutrition and electrolyte balance, endotracheal intubation if needed.

Type II respiratory failure
Causes
Type II respiratory failure can be broken down anatomically as dysfunction somewhere between the brainstem
and the chest wall:
• Reduced central drive (e.g. sedation and brainstem
disorders).
• Neuromuscular disease (e.g. spinal cord lesions,
poliomyelitis, myasthenia gravis and diaphragmatic
palsy).
• Thoracic wall abnormalities (e.g. kyphoscoliosis and
obesity).
• Intrinsic lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD, pneumonia and lung fibrosis).

be administered with care is not ‘hypoxic respiratory
drive’ but due to oxygen-driven pulmonary vasocon_ mismatch. Oxygen therapy must

be carefully controlled to ensure that sufficient oxygen
is supplied, usually 24% via a Venturi mask, to prevent
death from hypoxaemia (remember that saturations of
88–92% are adequate) but without worsening the respiratory acidosis. This needs repeated monitoring of
ABGs. (See British Thoracic Society Guidelines on emergency oxygen use in adult patients, Oct 2008.)
Other therapeutic objectives include:
• Specific therapy of the underlying cause (e.g. antimicrobial and bronchodilator therapy for an infective
exacerbation of COPD).
• General supportive care as for type I failure.
In certain circumstances, non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
via a face or nasal mask can augment minute ventilation
enabling control of CO2, allowing the underlying disease
to be treated and endotracheal intubation and its negative consequences to be avoided. However, NIV is not
a substitute for formal mechanical ventilation if it is
needed but cannot be provided. Chemical stimulants
to breathing such as doxapram are rarely used now.

HINTS AND TIPS
Beware! Some patients with type II respiratory failure
may deteriorate if given uncontrolled high-flow
oxygen. The underlying physiology causing this is
oxygen-sensitive pulmonary vasoconstriction rather
than ‘dependence on hypoxic drive’

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember to always note the inspired oxygen
concentration when taking an arterial blood gas
sample.

Management

Prognosis in acute respiratory
failure

As in type I failure, the main therapeutic objective is to
ensure adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs by administering oxygen therapy. However, in the most common clinical setting (an acute exacerbation of COPD),
some patients may have chronic CO2 retention. In the
past, the teaching was that because this patient group
was reliant on their ‘hypoxic drive’ for ventilation, oxygen therapy could be harmful. As a result oxygen was

The course of the disease and its prognosis depend to a
great extent on the underlying pathology and the premorbid condition of the patient. In patients with COPD
who do not require mechanical ventilation, the immediate prognosis is good. Patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with septicaemia
have a very poor prognosis, with mortality rates of
approximately 90%. In general, patients requiring

218

Asthma
ventilation for respiratory failure have survival rates of
approximately 60% to weaning off the ventilator,
40% to discharge from hospital and approximately 30%
1-year survival.

ASTHMA

Introduction
Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by an
increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree
to many different stimuli, resulting in episodes of reversible airway obstruction. It manifests as episodes of
shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness and wheeze.
These symptoms may resolve spontaneously or be relieved by treatment.
Asthma is episodic, with acute, exacerbations interspersed by symptom-free periods. Typically, most attacks are short (minutes to hours) and, clinically, the
patient appears to recover completely after an attack.
In more severe asthma, patients can experience some
degree of airway obstruction daily, with accompanying
symptoms.
Asthma is common, with a prevalence of approximately 10% of the population in the UK. It appears to
be increasing worldwide for reasons that remain uncertain. Bronchial asthma occurs at all ages but peaks in
childhood and is more common in boys. However, in
adult asthma, the sex ratio is approximately equal by
the age of 30 years. In the UK, 1000–2000 people die
from acute asthma attacks every year.

Aetiology
Asthma is likely to be a combination of multiple environmental and genetic factors.
Many asthmatics are atopic, with the production of
IgE in response to an antigenic challenge. Atopic asthma
can be associated with a personal or family history of allergy such as hay fever, urticaria and eczema. There may
also be increased levels of IgE in the serum and a positive response to provocation tests (e.g. methacholine
challenge).
The ‘hygiene hypothesis’ is supported by epidemiological evidence and much debated. It suggests that early
exposure to allergens reduces the allergic response and
hence blunts allergen sensitivity in later life, reducing
the likelihood of asthma. Our more hygienic lifestyles
reduce childhood allergen exposure and may have contributed to the increase in asthma.
Intrinsic asthma is a term used to describe patients
with no personal or family history of allergy, negative
skin tests and normal serum levels of IgE. Many develop
typical symptoms following an upper respiratory infection, which leads to paroxysms of wheezing and shortness of breath that can last for months.

31

In general, asthma that occurs in childhood or early
adult life tends to have a strong allergic component,
whereas asthma that develops late tends to be non-allergic.
However, many patients do not fit into either category but fall into a group with a mixture of allergic
and non-allergic features.

Pathophysiology
Many theories have been proposed to explain the
increased airway reactivity of asthma. The relationship
between atopy and environment in the airway inflammation of asthma is uncertain. Many theories and mediators are proposed as the mechanisms for asthma. The
role of IgE, various cytokines and chemokines, mast
cells, histamine, eosinophils, leukotrienes, cell adhesion molecules and activated T lymphocytes – in particular the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells – provides
much academic debate and has provided new therapeutic targets such as monoclonal antibodies against IgE.
The clinical features of asthma probably derive from
chronic airway inflammation causing denuded airway
epithelium, inflammatory cell infiltrate, mast cell activation plus smooth muscle and mucous gland hypertrophy. Acute events produce an intense immediate
inflammatory reaction involving bronchoconstriction,
vascular congestion and oedema formation – the pathological hallmarks of asthma.
A number of factors interact with normal airway responsiveness and provoke acute episodes, including:
• Allergens (e.g. house dust mites and animal dander).
• Drugs (e.g. beta-blockers and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs).
• Environmental (e.g. climatic conditions and air
pollution).
• Occupations (e.g. exposure to industrial chemicals,
drugs, metals, dusts).
• Infections (e.g. viral and bacterial).
• Exercise.
• Emotion.
• Cigarette smoke.

Clinical features of asthma
The classic symptoms of asthma consist of shortness of
breath, wheeze, chest tightness and coughing. In its
most typical form, asthma is an episodic disease and
the symptoms coexist.
At the onset of an attack, patients experience tightness
in the chest, often with a non-productive cough. Breathing becomes audibly harsh, speech is difficult, wheezing
becomes prominent, expiration is prolonged as airflow is
reduced, and patients frequently have both tachypnoea
and tachycardia. If the attack is severe or prolonged, there
may be a loss of breath sounds and the wheeze becomes
either very high-pitched or inaudible as airflow is severely

219

Respiratory disease
compromised. Accessory muscles of respiration are used
and pulsus paradoxus can develop.
Less typically, a patient with asthma may present
with intermittent episodes of non-productive cough
or shortness of breath on exertion. These patients often
have a normal physical examination but may wheeze after repeated forced exhalations or may show evidence of
airways obstruction with spirometry. Occasionally, a
provocation test may be required to make the diagnosis
of airway hyperresponsiveness.

Management of asthma

Confirming the diagnosis of asthma

• Drugs that inhibit smooth muscle contraction (e.g.
beta-2-agonists, anticholinergics and methylxanthines such as theophylline).
• Drugs that prevent or reverse airway inflammation
(e.g. corticosteroids and mast cell stabilizing agents).
• Drugs that modify the action of leukotrienes (e.g. leukotriene antagonists or 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors).

Diagnosing asthma is usually not difficult, especially if
the patient is seen during an acute attack. In addition, a
history of episodic symptoms and a history of eczema,
hay fever or urticaria is valuable. Nocturnal symptoms
(e.g. awakening short of breath, coughing or wheezing)
are very common features.

Investigations
The diagnosis of asthma is established by demonstrating reversible expiratory airflow obstruction. Reversibility is traditionally defined as >15% or a 400 mL increase in the
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) following administration of a beta-2-agonist or a greater than 20% diurnal
variation on more than 3 days in a week for 2 weeks in a
peak expiratory flow rate diary. Peak flow diary may be
combined with a 2-week trial of oral prednisolone. Once
the diagnosis is confirmed, peak expiratory flow rates
(PEFR) at home, or the FEV1 in the clinic, can be used to
monitor the course of the illness and the effectiveness of
therapy. Blood eosinophilia, high serum IgE levels may
be supportive but are not specific for asthma. Very high
serum IgE or eosinophilia is not typical for asthma and
may indicate asthma plus another diagnosis, e.g. allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Similarly, a chest
X-ray (CXR) showing hyperinflation is not diagnostic
of asthma.

Differential diagnosis

Chronic asthma requires long-term management (see
British Thoracic Society guideline on the management of
asthma, January 2012). Ideally, the model of care that
characterizes all chronic diseases should be applied
(i.e. patient education and empowerment, pharmacological therapy and liaison between different professional groups in hospital and the community).
The therapeutic targets of medications used for
asthma include:

In clinical practice, the two most common settings in
which patients require treatment are emergency treatment of acute severe asthma and chronic therapy.

Chronic therapy
This is aimed at achieving a stable, asymptomatic state
with the best pulmonary function possible, recognizing
and treating exacerbations appropriately while limiting
quality of life as little as possible. The first step is to
educate patients to function as partners in their management. This includes identifying triggers and avoiding
precipitants (e.g. smoking). The severity of the illness
needs to be assessed and monitored with objective
measures of lung function (PEFR diaries). Adjusting
therapy guided by non-invasive measures of airway
inflammation such as sputum eosinophil counts or
exhaled nitric oxide levels may become more common
outside of research settings. Regular follow-up care is
mandatory. This should involve doctors, both in hospital and GPs, asthma specialist nurses, pharmacists and
physiotherapists.
HINTS AND TIPS

In a small minority of patients the diagnosis can cause
some difficulty and differential diagnoses should be
considered:

If asthma control is poor, do not forget to assess inhaler
technique.

• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
• Upper airway obstruction: tumour, vocal cord dysfunction and laryngeal oedema.
• Endobronchial disease: foreign body aspiration,
neoplasm, bronchial stenosis.
• Left ventricular failure.
• Carcinoid tumours.
• Recurrent pulmonary emboli.
• Eosinophilic pneumonias.
• Systemic vasculitis with pulmonary involvement.

Drug therapy should be kept as simple as possible.
Many patients find the division of drugs into ‘preventers’ and ‘relievers’ useful to understand their disease
and its treatment.
There is consensus worldwide that the stepwise management of asthma is effective. In the UK guidelines are
produced by the British Thoracic Society – for a summary
see Fig. 31.1. Treatment is stepped up when symptoms

Step

Measures

1. Mild intermittent
asthma

Inhaled short-acting beta-2-agonist as required

2. Regular preventer
therapy

Start inhaled steroid regularly 200–800 mg/day (e.g. beclometasone, budesonide or
fluticasone)

3. Initial add-on therapy

Add long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA) regularly
Increase dose of regular inhaled steroid
Add third medication, theophylline or leukotriene receptor antagonist
Slow-release beta-2-agonist tablets may also help

4. Persistent poor control

Trial of high dose of regular inhaled steroid
Addition of medications not used in step 3

5. Oral steroid

Add lowest dose of oral steroid to achieve control of symptoms
Continue maximum dose inhaled steroid
Must be under care of a respiratory physician

Treatment is started at the step most appropriate to initial severity, and a ‘rescue’ course of prednisolone can be given at any time and with any
step to cover an exacerbation. Move up the ladder if relief bronchodilators are needed frequently or night-time symptoms occur. Check
compliance and inhaler technique, and consider the use of spacer devices. (After British Thoracic Society.)

(e.g. nocturnal wakening, morning dips) are not controlled. Short-acting beta-2-agonists are the first step, then
inhaled corticosteroids, which can then be combined with
long-acting beta-2-agonists, anticholinergics, oral steroids, leukotriene modifiers and theophyllines added in
varying combinations. When control is obtained, the
treatment should be reduced to the lowest feasible level.
COMMUNICATION
Asthma control can be greatly improved with a clear
self-management plan enabling the patient to lead in
their symptom control. Asthma nurse specialists and
physiotherapists can be crucial in promoting
independence – involve them!

Emergency treatment
Emergency treatment of acute asthma is one of the most
common emergencies seen in medical practice and its
life-threatening nature can be underestimated by the
less experienced. Senior help should be involved earlier
rather than later.
Features indicating severe asthma include the inability to speak in sentences, tachypnoea, tachycardia, very
poor PEFR, low oxygen saturations, the use of accessory
muscles (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles) and
marked hyperinflation of the thorax with absent breath
sounds, cyanosis, absence of wheeze and a tiring patient. Measurements of arterial blood gases (ABGs)
and the PEFR or FEV1 help in assessing severity and will

guide management. A checklist for the assessment and
treatment of these patients is shown in Fig. 31.2.
Generally, there is a direct correlation between the severity of the obstruction with which the patient presents
and the time it takes to resolve it. If the patient is drowsy,
not tachypnoeic, making little respiratory effort with a
silent chest (no wheeze) and a normal PCO2 (which is
a bad indicator in any patient who presents with an
asthma attack), they are NOT improving and, in fact,
respiratory arrest may be imminent and intubation
and intensive care are required.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE
PULMONARY DISEASE

Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
term used to cover several distinct entities including
both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is defined
by expiratory airflow limitation with an FEV1 to forced
vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 70% and limited
reversibility to bronchodilators. The percentage of the
FEV1 compared to the predicted normal allows classification of the disease severity.
Chronic bronchitis is defined by excessive mucus
production sufficient to cause cough with sputum for
at least 3 months of the year for more than two consecutive years in the absence of another condition known
to cause sputum production. Emphysema is permanent,
abnormal distension of the air spaces distal to the

It is ultimately a histological diagnosis.

Aetiology

31

Acute respiratory infections
These have been hypothesized as a factor associated
with both the aetiology and progression of COPD.

Cigarette smoking

Pathophysiology

Cigarette smoking is the most commonly identified factor associated with both chronic bronchitis during life
and extent of emphysema at postmortem (remember
this is a histological diagnosis). It is the causative agent
in 90% of patients with COPD. Prolonged cigarette
smoking impairs ciliary movement, inhibits function
of alveolar macrophages (dust cells) and leads to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucus-secreting glands. It is
probable that smoke also inhibits antiproteases and
causes polymorphonuclear leucocytes to release elastase. Smoking tobacco and marijuana synergistically increases the risk of COPD. An accurate smoking history
should be taken and expressed as a pack year history
(20 cigarettes per day for one year equates to one pack
year).

The hallmark of chronic bronchitis is hypertrophy of
the mucus-producing glands found in the submucosa
of large cartilaginous airways. In lungs studied at postmortem, there is goblet cell hyperplasia, mucosal and
submucosal inflammatory cells, oedema, peribronchial fibrosis, intraluminal mucous plugs and increased smooth muscle in small airways.
Inflammation in chronic bronchitis occurs at the
alveolar epithelium and differs from the predominantly
eosinophilic inflammation of asthma by the predominance of T lymphocytes and neutrophils.
Emphysema is classified according to the pattern of
involvement of the gas-exchanging units (acini) of the
lung distal to the terminal bronchiole. In centriacinar
emphysema, the distension and destruction is mainly
limited to the respiratory bronchioles, with relatively
less change peripherally in the acinus; these are the
changes found in smokers. They are more prominent
in the upper lobes. Panacinar emphysema involves both
the central and peripheral portions of the acinus; these
changes are those seen in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
and occur more commonly in the lower lobes.
When emphysema is severe, with large emphysematous ‘bullous’ air spaces, it may be difficult to distinguish between the two types because they can coexist
in the same lung.
The chronic airflow limitation that is the hallmark of
COPD is a consequence of small airways disease. There
is narrowing and blockage of small airways by an inflammatory bronchiolitis and airways collapse in expiration due to the loss of elastic recoil and radial traction
to balance the positive transmural pressure. This limits
airflow and results in the air trapping and hyperinflation seen on CXR and lung function tests.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
Patients homozygous (1/625–2000) for a deficiency of
the protease inhibitor alpha-1-antitrypsin have a greatly
increased incidence of early-onset emphysema. The protein is a protease inhibitor that protects cells against
protease such as neutrophil elastases. The gene is on
chromosome 14 and the defect is in release from the
liver where it is synthesized. Patients with the ZZ genotype have blood levels of 10% of those with the normal
MM genotype. As well as being at increased risk of developing emphysema, patients with the ZZ genotype are
also at risk of chronic liver disease.
The importance of heterozygosity for this condition
in patients, both smokers and non-smokers, is not fully
established. Nevertheless, it is prudent to advise against
smoking.

Air pollution
Air pollution with particulate matter is associated with
exacerbations of COPD, and the incidence and mortality rates for chronic bronchitis and emphysema are
probably higher in heavily industrialized urban areas
and in those areas where open fires are used indoors
for cooking and heating purposes.

Occupation
Occupational exposure to a variety of dusts and fumes
(e.g. gold and coal mining) may contribute to the development of COPD, particularly in non-smokers, and results in a higher prevalence of chronic bronchitis among
employees.

Clinical features of COPD
The most common feature of COPD is dyspnoea –
initially during activity but progressively at rest. Other
symptoms include cough, sputum production (particularly in chronic bronchitis), wheeze, prolonged expiratory phase and tiredness. Patients with severe COPD
may develop respiratory failure. Most patients have
features of both chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
It remains traditional for teaching purposes to categorize patients as having predominant features of one or
the other and to use the terms ‘pink puffer’ and ‘blue
bloater’. The usefulness of such classifications in clinical
practice is limited.

223

Respiratory disease
An acute exacerbation of COPD is a common cause
for hospital admission and is defined as a sudden worsening of symptoms (increased cough, sputum production and dyspnoea) often, but not always, caused by
bacterial or viral infections.
HINTS AND TIPS
Ask about exercise tolerance (e.g. climbing stairs,
walking distance to the shop), home nebulizers, longterm home oxygen therapy, and number of previous
hospital admissions for acute exacerbations to aid in
establishing disease severity.

Investigations
Establishing the diagnosis
History and physical examination should be supplemented by tests of lung function performed during a
chronic stable period, pulse oximetry and chest radiography. Post brochodilatory spirometry is essential for
diagnosis and severity assessment. The CXR is not diagnostic, although hyperexpansion is certainly in keeping
with COPD, but is necessary to rule out alternative
diagnoses. A full blood count should routinely be performed to identify anaemia or polycythaemia. The body
mass index needs to be calculated for all patients. In severe disease spirometry, lung volumes, transfer factor
and ABGs should be measured. Reversibility testing is
controversial due to the natural variability of FEV1,
the presence of significant reversibility (>0.4 L) suggesting an asthmatic component to the disease. It may be
difficult to differentiate COPD and asthma. The two
may also overlap each other. Fig. 31.3 lists the characteristic features of both.

and asthma.

The acute exacerbation
Patients who present with an acute exacerbation of
symptoms require a CXR, serial ABGs, a full blood
count, U&Es, CRP and an ECG. The patient may be
too unwell to perform peak expiratory flow measurements or spirometry. If the patient is pyrexic, and an infective cause for the exacerbation is suspected, blood
cultures should be performed in an attempt to isolate
the causative organism and thus guide antibiotic therapy. Sputum cultures should be sent.

Management of COPD
Management of patients with COPD is based on an
accurate diagnosis, assessment of severity of symptoms
and degree of airflow obstruction, smoking status, the
extent of disability and ensuring optimal medical therapies are in place (NICE guideline on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, June 2010). Assessment of
severity is based on the FEV1, as measured by spirometry, which is compared to the predicted value (based on
age, sex, height) and expressed as a percentage (FEV1 %
predicted). Stage 1 (mild) disease is defined as >80%,
stage 2 (moderate) as 50–79%, stage 3 (severe) as
30–49% and stage 4 (very severe) as <30%.
Treatment strategies for COPD are varied and a multidisciplinary approach to the patient is often required.
A treatment plan should consider:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Smoking cessation.
Patient education.
Optimizing pharmacological therapies.
Pulmonary rehabilitation.
Nutritional and psychological support.
Treatment of acute exacerbations.
Treatment of cor pulmonale, if present.
Home oxygen therapy and home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) if indicated.

Long-term treatment of COPD
Smoking cessation
This remains the single most important intervention by
the healthcare team to modify the natural course of the
disease. It should be reinforced repeatedly. Help from
COMMUNICATION
The importance of smoking cessation in COPD cannot
be stressed enough. It is the single biggest change a
patient can make to prolong life. While it should be
reinforced in all consultations, do not antagonize the
patient. It can be useful to express understanding as
to how hard it is, how addictive smoking is and to not
let them become despondent after one attempt fails.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
smoking cessation specialists and pharmacological
assistance with nicotine replacement, varenicline or
bupropion may improve effectiveness.

Bronchodilators
These are important in symptom relief from COPD, and
long-acting agents reduce exacerbations. They are commonly given to patients regardless of objective reversible airflow obstruction. They can reduce dynamic
hyperinflation not measurable by changes in FEV1
and exertional dyspnoea. Patients may still find them
useful for symptom relief and often become psychologically attached to them. They include:
• Short-acting beta-agonists, e.g. salbutamol and terbutaline.
• Long-acting beta-agonists, e.g. salmeterol and formoterol.
• Anticholinergics, e.g. ipratropium and tiotropium
(a long-acting once-daily drug).
• Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, e.g. theophyllines.
Drugs can be delivered through inhalers, spacer devices
or home nebulizers.

Corticosteroids
Inhaled corticosteroids in patients whose FEV1 is <50%
predicted reduces exacerbations and improves health
status. There may be a small effect on the decline in
FEV1 compared with placebo; as yet, the drugs have
not been shown to improve mortality. Fluticasone
and budesonide are examples. Combined use with a
long-acting beta-agonist is preferred.
Oral steroids are used in exacerbations of COPD and
some patients take them long term; this should be
discouraged.

Pulmonary rehabilitation
This is an organized programme of graded exercise, nutritional advice and patient education. It improves symptoms and exacerbations and can increase exercise ability.

Domiciliary oxygen therapy
Short bursts of oxygen for symptomatic relief may help
some patients. Long-term (>15 h per day) oxygen therapy (LTOT) is to be recommended in certain COPD patients as it has a survival benefit. They include:
• Stable non-smokers with PO2 <7.3 kPa and FEV1
<1.5 L.
• Stable non-smokers with PO2 between 7.3 and
8.0 kPa and pulmonary hypertension.
• Oxygen can be prescribed to terminally ill patients

31

Assessment should be done when the patient is stable,
not during an acute exacerbation. ABGs should be done
to achieve the correct PO2 and ensure the Pco2 is stable
during oxygen supplementation. LTOT is contraindicated if the patient is a smoker due to the potential
fire risk.

Surgery
Some patients may be suitable for bullectomy or lung
volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to improve symptoms. A variety of bronchoscopic techniques for LVRS
are in trials. In end-stage disease, lung transplantation
is an option for some, often younger, patients.

Other therapies
There is little evidence to suggest that prophylactic antibiotics, either systemic or nebulized, alter disease progression or prevent exacerbations. Vaccination against
influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia should be
offered to patients with COPD. Regular assessment of
nutritional and psychological status is recommended.
Mucolytic agents can help alleviate symptoms if patients
have a chronic productive cough. They do not reduce
the of exacerbation.

Acute exacerbation of COPD
Treatments include nebulized beta-agonists and anticholinergics, antibiotics if infection is suspected, systemic steroids, controlled oxygen to maintain saturations
of 88–92% (if CO2 retainer) or 94–98% (if non-CO2
retaining), chest physiotherapy and theophylline if appropriate. Endotracheal intubation may be indicated
for severe respiratory failure if a reversible pathology is
thought present.
NIV has been shown to be effective in certain patients
with COPD and acute type II respiratory failure, with a
benefit over intubation. This may be a consequence of
avoiding the side effects of mechanical ventilation
rather than NIV per se.
Acute exacerbation of COPD often requires admission to hospital. Some less severe cases may be discharged home by an intensive community team. This
reduces admission rates and the burden on the secondary care provider while promoting independence and
self-reliance for the patient.

Prognosis
In severe disease this is poor, with considerable symptomatic discomfort as the disease process and lung dysfunction become more severe. The involvement of
palliative medicine services should be considered. No
single therapy changes the natural time course of the

225

Respiratory disease
disease; in milder disease the importance of smoking
cessation cannot be overemphasized. It will not repair
damaged lung tissue but the rate of decline in FEV1 with
time will revert to that of a non-smoker.
HINTS AND TIPS
Discussing the patient’s wishes with regards to
resuscitation status in severe COPD is difficult. It is,
however, an important part of the management plan
and should be done at an appropriate time using
sensitive language.

PNEUMONIA

Introduction
Pneumonia is an infection of the pulmonary parenchyma (i.e. the functional lung tissue) causing fever,
chest signs and symptoms and air space consolidation
on a CXR. It is a common condition with an incidence
of 5–10/1000 population. Many bacterial species, viruses, fungi and parasites can cause pneumonia. As
such, it is not a single disease but a group of specific
infections, each with a different epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation and clinical course. Identification of the aetiological microorganism should be
of primary importance to enable appropriate antimicrobial therapy. However, empirical antimicrobial
therapy is often started without identification of the organisms since pneumonia has a 10% mortality for
those admitted to hospital.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia
(nosocomial)
This is new-onset pneumonia occurring more than 48 h
after admission to hospital. It can be caused by all of the
above agents, but Gram-negative organisms such as
Pseudomonas and Klebsiella are much more common.

Aspiration pneumonia
This occurs as a result of the aspiration of gastrointestinal material because of an inability to protect the airway
such as after a cerebral vascular event or with a decreased consciousness level. Anaerobic organisms may
be implicated. Stroke patients are at particular risk of aspiration pneumonia and involvement of speech and
language therapists (SALT) is vital in preventing this
potentially fatal complication.

Opportunistic pneumonia
Certain groups of patients are of increased risk of pneumonia. Individuals with cystic fibrosis are at increased
risk of Pseudomonas pneumonia due to changes in the
composition of airway surface mucus. Patients who
have an impaired immune system (e.g. HIV positive)
may be at increased risk of fungal (e.g. Aspergillus), Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly PCP) or viral (e.g. CMV, HSV)
pneumonia. Lastly, patients on respiratory support
(e.g. ventilated in intensive care) are at increased risk
of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) commonly
caused by Pseudomonas or Klebsiella.

Clinical features of pneumonia
Aetiology

Typical

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

The ‘typical’ symptoms of pneumonia are fever, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, cough productive of purulent sputum
and, in some cases, pleuritic chest pain. Signs of pulmonary consolidation (dullness, increased vocal resonance,
bronchial breath sounds and coarse crepitations) may be
found on physical examination and coincide with abnormalities on the CXR.

This occurs out of hospital or within 48 h of admission
and may be primary or secondary to existing disease.
Causes include Streptococcus pneumoniae (most common), Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus.
Viruses are implicated in approximately 10% of cases. In
pre-existing lung disease (e.g. COPD/bronchiectasis),
organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella
catarrhalis are more common.

Atypical pneumonia
This is caused by organisms such as Mycoplasma, Legionella and Chlamydia species. They can be acquired in
the community or in institutions. Detailed travel and
occupational and social history are important in identifying risk factors.

226

Atypical
It was traditionally stated that ‘atypical’ pneumonia has
a more gradual onset, a dry cough and extrapulmonary
symptoms (headache, muscle aching, fatigue, sore
throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). It is not possible to accurately predict the causative organism from the
symptoms. The term ‘atypical pneumonia’ remains in
use but it is the organisms that are ‘atypical’ and not
the symptoms.

Pneumonia

Diagnosis of pneumonia
Imaging
• A CXR can confirm the presence of the diffuse or lobar
pulmonary infiltrates and assess the extent of infection.
Air bronchograms may be seen within the areas of consolidation. Other features that may be present include
pleural effusions, pulmonary cavitation or hilar lymphadenopathy. Cavitating lesions may be caused by
oral anaerobic bacteria, enteric Gram-negative bacilli,
S. aureus, Pseudomonas, Legionella, TB and fungi.
• CT is not commonly used as a first-line imaging
modality. However, if the CXR is suggestive of a
space-occupying lesion, a CT scan would be indicated.

Blood tests
• Full blood count may show a neutrophilia.
• ABG: assess oxygenation, hypercapnia and pH.
• U&Es: raised urea is indicative of dehydration and is
part of the CURB65 score (see later) which assesses
severity.
• C-reactive protein: may be raised and can help in
assessing response to treatment.
• Blood cultures if pyrexic (and prior to commencing
antibiotic therapy, but should not delay antibiotics).
• Serology for atypical organisms should be taken if
clinical suspicion is present and then repeated in
10–14 days.

Other tests
• Sputum microscopy and culture is important in severe bacterial pneumonia and those with chronic
lung disease. Unfortunately, sputum is frequently
contaminated by potentially pathogenic bacteria
that colonize the upper respiratory tract without
causing disease.
• Pleural tap: pleural effusion, if present and thought
to be parapneumonic, should be aspirated to assess
for infection or empyema and drained if needed. Microscopy, culture and sensitivity should be performed. If there is any suggestion there may be a
more sinister cause for the effusion a sample should
be sent for cytology.
• The urine can be tested for streptococcal and Legionella urinary antigen. These can remain positive even
after antibiotics have been commenced.

Bronchoscopy
• Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is rarely performed for
pneumonia but has become the standard invasive
procedure used to obtain lower respiratory tract secretions from seriously ill or immunocompromised
patients. Samples are collected with a protected double-sheathed brush, by bronchoalveolar lavage or by

31

transbronchial biopsy at the site of the pulmonary
consolidation. It may be indicated too if there is evidence of collapse due to airway obstruction/ tumour or mucous plug.

Severity
• The management of community acquired pneumonia is guided by the severity. The CURB65 score is a
validated tool to assess severity. Each component
(confusion, urea, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and age) scores 1 point. A score of 0 or 1 means
home treatment is possible, a score of 2 warrants
hospital treatment and a score of 3 or above indicates
severe pneumonia requiring admission and aggressive management. Increasing score is associated with
increasing mortality.
• Confusion: new confusion, abbreviated mental test
score <8.
• Urea >7 mmol/L.
• Respiratory rate >30 per min.
• Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and/or diastolic
blood pressure <60 mmHg.
• Age >65.

Management
The mainstay treatment for pneumonia is antibiotics,
oxygen (aiming for saturations of 94–98%), adequate
hydration and analgesia for potential pleuritic pain. However, pneumonia is a leading cause of sepsis, particularly
in the elderly. Sepsis is a very common cause for hospital
admission and has a high mortality. Recent awareness
campaigns (e.g. surviving sepsis) have stressed the importance of recognizing sepsis early and treating promptly. All
patients who are septic (defined as systemic inflammatory
response syndrome, SIRS, in the presence of suspected or
proven infection) must receive the ‘sepsis six’ care bundle.
This consists of blood cultures, lactate and Hb measurement, urine output monitoring (potentially through urinary catheterization), fluid resuscitation, oxygen therapy
and antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy will often be
empirical. It is important antibiotics are given early and
as a junior doctor simply prescribing the drug is not sufficient – make sure it is given. The appropriate antimicrobial
treatment of pneumonia is shown in Fig. 31.4. However,
check with your local microbiology department for their
guidelines as local antibiotic sensitivities vary.
HINTS AND TIPS
SIRS – two from: heart rate >90, temperature >38 C
or <36 C, respiratory rate >20, WCC >12 or <4.
Sepsis – SIRS in the presence of proven or suspected
infection.

PULMONARY EMBOLISM
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, potentially fatal and frequently missed diagnosis. It results from
thrombus formation in the venous circulation that
embolizes to the lungs, obstructing a pulmonary artery,
causing hypoxia and circulatory collapse.
Risk factors include immobility, including ‘economy
class syndrome’ with air travel, surgery, malignancy,
obesity, pregnancy, the contraceptive pill and one of
the increasingly described thrombophilic conditions
(e.g. factor V Leiden or the prothrombin 20210A gene
mutation).

Clinical features
Dyspnoea is the most frequent symptom and tachypnoea is the most frequent sign in PE. Dyspnoea,
syncope, hypotension or cyanosis indicate a massive

228

ECG

Imaging
• CXR: usually normal but may show atelectasis or a
small wedge shadow.
• CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA): the recommended initial lung imaging modality and particularly useful for diagnosing PE in more proximal
pulmonary arteries and those with pre-existing lung
disease. A negative good-quality CTPA is sufficient to
rule out PE.

Lung cancer
• Pulmonary angiography is now rarely performed
other than in certain circumstances (e.g. pregnancy
or acutely ill patients who may require embolectomy).

Other tests
• Echocardiography may show evidence of acute right
ventricular dysfunction, especially in large haemodynamically significant PEs in which thrombolysis
is considered.
• Thromboembolism from deep vein thrombosis is
assessed with compression ultrasound or venography.

Management
Current BTS guidelines are based on 2003 recommendations and NICE is in the process of producing their recommendations. The majority of patients are treated with
low-molecular-weight heparin or IV heparin followed
by oral warfarin for a variable period. Oral anticoagulation should only be commenced once VTE has been reliably confirmed. The target international normalized ratio
(INR) should be 2.0–3.0; when this is achieved, heparin
can be discontinued. The standard duration of oral anticoagulation is 4–6 weeks for temporary risk factors, 3
months for first idiopathic, and at least 6 months for
other. The risk of bleeding should be balanced with that
of further VTE. Monitoring of maintenance warfarin treatment is performed regularly in clinical practice, aiming to
keep the INR in the range 2.0–3.0.
HINTS AND TIPS
Many drugs interact with warfarin to enhance or
diminish its effect. Ask the patient to report any
changes in treatment. Certain dietary factors can also
lead to INR changes.

Patients who have recurrent or a strong family history of
thromboembolic events should be screened for recognized hypercoagulable states. They are may need lifelong
anticoagulation and should be considered for a venacaval filter if warfarin fails to prevent further emboli.
Large acute PEs with severe hypoxia and circulatory
failure may require inotropic support and thrombolysis.
The same contraindications apply as for acute myocardial infarction.

LUNG CANCER
Lung cancer is the second most common malignant disease in Western countries (after breast cancer). In the
UK, 40 000 new cases are diagnosed every year. One-

quarter of all cancer deaths are attributed to lung cancer;
only 5% of patients are cured. The term ‘lung cancer’ is
usually reserved for primary tumours arising from the
respiratory epithelium (bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli) rather than metastases from distant malignancies.
Four major cell types make up 90% of all primary lung
neoplasms:
• Squamous cell carcinoma (35–45%): from the large
airways, it grows slowly and spreads late.
• Adenocarcinoma (including bronchioloalveolar cell
carcinoma) (20–30%): peripheral and more common in non-smokers.
• Large cell (anaplastic) carcinoma (5–10%): heterogeneous group of undifferentiated tumours.
• Small cell (oat cell) carcinoma (15–20%): from central airways, it grows rapidly and spreads early.
The first three are commonly grouped together as ‘nonsmall-cell lung cancer’ as they share common prognoses
and treatment strategies.
The remainder includes undifferentiated carcinomas, carcinoids and rarer tumour types (e.g. mesothelioma arising from the pleura following asbestos
exposure). All cell types have different natural histories
and responses to therapy, and therefore making a correct histological diagnosis is the mandatory first step
to correct assessment and treatment.

Aetiology
The vast majority of lung cancers (non-adenocarcinoma) in the UK (approximately 95%) are attributable
to cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoke contains numerous well-documented carcinogens. There is a clear link
to both the quantity of cigarettes smoked and the duration over which they are smoked. The more somebody
smokes and the longer they smoke for, the more likely
they are to develop lung cancer (Fig. 31.6). The converse
is that if smokers stop smoking the risk of cancer
steadily declines over time.

number of cigarettes smoked.

Respiratory disease
The role of passive smoking in cancer risk for
non-smokers is still debated and will continue to be
so. Current wisdom is that there is a small but important
increase in the risk of lung cancer if exposed to passive
cigarette smoking.
Other risks are much less common and include radon exposure in certain parts of the UK (e.g. Cornwall),
asbestos exposure and fibrotic lung disease.

Pathology
Like other carcinomas, it is thought that lung cancer is not
caused by a single insult but follows the pattern of cellular
dysplasia progressing to carcinoma and spread as the
burden of genetic damage accumulates and key oncogenes are mutated. For example, the K-ras proto-oncogene
is implicated in 10–30% of all adenocarcinomas.

Clinical features of lung cancer
Although 5–15% of patients are detected while asymptomatic, usually on a routine chest radiograph, the vast
majority of patients present with signs or symptoms.

Systemic features
Anorexia, cachexia and weight loss are common. The
patient may have digital clubbing and tar staining of
the fingers.

Local invasion
• Endobronchial growth: this may result in cough, haemoptysis, wheeze, stridor, dyspnoea and postobstructive pneumonitis (fever and productive cough).
• Invasion of the chest wall: this could cause pain (pleural or chest wall involvement), cough, dyspnoea and
symptoms of lung abscess due to tumour cavitation.
• Transbronchial spread: transbronchial spread (especially bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) produces
growth along multiple alveolar surfaces with resultant impairment of oxygen transfer, dyspnoea,
hypoxia and the production of copious sputum.
• Invasion of other thoracic structures: this may lead to
airway obstruction, oesophageal compression with
dysphagia, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis with
hoarseness, phrenic nerve paralysis with elevation of
the hemidiaphragm and dyspnoea, and sympathetic
nerve paralysis with Horner’s syndrome (ptosis, miosis, enophthalmos and ipsilateral facial loss of sweating). Pancoast’s tumour growing in the apex of the
lung extends locally with involvement of the eighth
cervical and first and second thoracic nerves of the brachial plexus. There is shoulder pain, which characteristically radiates in the ulnar distribution of the arm,
often with destruction of the first and second ribs seen

230

on CXR. Other problems of regional spread include
superior vena cava syndrome from vascular obstruction, pericardial and cardiac extension with resultant
effusion or tamponade, lymphatic obstruction with
resultant pleural effusion, and lymphangitic spread
through the lungs with hypoxaemia and dyspnoea.

Paraneoplastic syndromes
These syndromes describe symptoms and signs resulting from extrapulmonary organ dysfunction unrelated
to space-occupying metastases. They occur in 15–20%
of lung cancer patients and are commonly due to tumour secretory products. Important paraneoplastic syndromes associated with lung cancer are listed in
Fig. 31.7. Occasionally, resection of the primary tumour
may result in resolution of the syndrome.

Diagnosis and further investigation
The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is dependent on the appropriate investigations (see NICE guidelines on lung cancer, April 2011). Only 10–15% of
patients are picked up as asymptomatic patients (incidental finding on CXR). The majority of patients present
with symptoms, most commonly persistent cough, haemoptysis and/or dyspnoea. The following are the appropriate investigations.

Imaging
• CXR: abnormal in most cases. Common findings include hilar masses (squamous and small cell), peripheral masses (adenocarcinoma), atelectasis, infiltrates,
cavitation (squamous cell) and pleural effusions.
Remember to compare to old films if available.
• CT: contrast-enhanced should include the neck,
chest, liver and adrenal glands to enable staging to
take place.
• PET-CT, MRI or plain X-ray films can be helpful in
assessing metastatic spread.

Blood tests
• Full blood count.
• Liver function test.
• U&Es (including calcium).

Extent of disease and tumour–
node–metastasis (TNM) staging
Eighty per cent of patients have inoperable disease at the
time of presentation. Small-cell cancer is nearly always disseminated at presentation. Diagnosis of this histological

type excludes surgical resection, except in very rare circumstances where there is a single, small, peripheral lesion. In
all other cell types, surgery is possible and the extent of disease is recorded by the TNM classification as shown in
Fig. 31.8. The staging of disease using the TNM classification also helps to estimate the prognosis with treatment.

Preoperative assessment
This is in two stages, firstly by assessing whether the cancer is potentially curable. CT remains the most common
method of assessing potential resectability. Positron
emission tomography (PET) is now widely available
for all surgical candidates.
Secondly, the fitness of the patient to undergo surgery is vital as many have such marked cardiorespiratory
disease that surgery is contraindicated. This is done by
assessing performance status and thorough physiological measurement such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing. If the patient is a current smoker, smoking cessation
advice should not be forgotten as it will help reduce
intra- and postoperative complications.

Management
Major treatment decisions are made on the basis of
whether a tumour is classified histologically as a
small-cell carcinoma or as one of the non-small-cell varieties (Fig. 31.9). In general, small-cell carcinomas have
already spread at the time of presentation so that curative surgery cannot be performed, and they are managed
primarily by chemotherapy, usually cisplatin, with or
without radiotherapy.
In contrast, non-small-cell cancers that are found to
be localized at the time of presentation should be considered for curative treatment with either surgery (pneumonectomy or lobectomy) or radiotherapy. Where
possible, open or thorascopic lobectomy is the surgical
treatment of choice. Hilar and mediastinal lymph node
sampling en bloc is always performed where surgery
with curative intent is performed. Curative radiotherapy
is offered to those patients with poorer respiratory
reserve. Chemotherapy, in particular in combination
with radiotherapy, is increasingly used to treat both
curative and palliative lung cancer.
If the tumour is inoperable, palliative care is essential as unpleasant dyspnoea and respiratory distress
may develop as the disease progresses. Palliative care

should be provided by general and specialist palliative
care providers in line with ‘Improving supportive and
palliative care for adults with cancer’ (NICE cancer service guidance). Radiotherapy may improve endobronchial obstructive symptoms, bone pain secondary to
metastases or superior vena cava obstruction. Dexamethasone or whole-brain radiotherapy can be used
to treat symptomatic brain metastases. Malignant pleural effusions can be tapped for symptomatic relief.

Prognosis
Fig. 31.10 gives 5-year survival rates in treated lung cancer patients. Perhaps because of the nihilistic view of
lung cancer they remain poor in the UK, where overall
5-year survival is approximately 5%, less than half that
in the USA.
COMMUNICATION
Patients are rarely surprised when the final diagnosis
of lung cancer is explained to them. Ask open questions
and seek their opinion as to what might be wrong with
them; this can enable cancer to be discussed more
easily as they have used the word first.

TUBERCULOSIS
Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic granulomatous disease
caused by a cell-mediated immune response to bacteria
belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
(MTB). The disease usually affects the lungs, although
in up to a third of cases other organs are involved. If
properly treated, TB caused by drug-susceptible strains
is curable in virtually all cases. Transmission usually
takes place through the airborne spread of droplets produced by patients with infectious pulmonary TB.
Of the pathogenic species belonging to the MTB, the
most frequent and important agent of human disease is

M. tuberculosis itself. Closely related organisms that can
also infect humans include Mycobacterium bovis (the
bovine tubercle bacillus, once an important cause of
TB transmitted by unpasteurized milk).
M. tuberculosis is a rod-shaped, non-spore-forming,
aerobic bacterium measuring 0.5–3 mm. Although
strictly Gram-positive, it may not stain readily and is
often neutral on the Gram stain. However, once stained,
the bacilli cannot be decolorized by acid alcohol, a characteristic justifying their classification as acid–alcoholfast bacilli (AAFB).
In most developed countries the incidence of TB fell
until the 1980s. It then reached a plateau and is now increasing again in the UK (Fig. 31.11). This is due to an
increase in susceptible groups. These include the elderly,
immigrants, people from ethnic minorities, alcoholics,
the homeless and immunocompromised groups (both
iatrogenic and pathological; human immunodeficiency

virus (HIV) is the most important group of the latter).
Worldwide, 9 million people contract the infection
and 2 million people die each year. TB is the cause of
death for most people with HIV and recent increases
in drug resistance have been alarming. Even in the UK
the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extremely-drug resistant (XDR) strains of TB are increasing
with associated morbidity and mortality.

Pathogenesis and pattern
of disease
TB is usually classified as pulmonary or extrapulmonary. Before HIV infection, 80% of all cases of TB were
limited to the lungs; now two-thirds of HIV-infected patients with TB have both pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, or even extrapulmonary disease on its own.

Pulmonary tuberculosis
Pulmonary TB can be classified as primary or reactivation (postprimary or secondary).

Primary pulmonary tuberculosis
Primary pulmonary TB results from an initial infection
with tubercle bacilli. The bacterium is taken up by alveolar macrophages and is either contained or progresses to
primary disease, particularly if the host immune system is
impaired. The lesion is usually peripheral and associated
with hilar or paratracheal lymph node enlargement. In
most cases, immunity develops, the lesion heals spontaneously and may later be seen as a small calcified nodule
(Ghon focus).
Patients with impaired immunity who develop primary pulmonary TB may progress rapidly to clinical illness. This may result from spread of infection by:
• Pleural effusion: which may lead to tuberculous
empyema.
• Necrosis and acute cavitation of the primary lesion:
known as progressive primary TB.

233

Respiratory disease
• Bloodstream dissemination: resulting in granulomatous lesions in various organs, or even miliary TB
with tuberculous meningitis.

Reactivation tuberculosis
Reactivation disease is sometimes termed adult, postprimary or secondary TB. It results from reactivation
of latent infection due to any form of debility or immunocompromise and is usually localized to the apical
and posterior segments of the upper lobes. Chest
radiographic changes can vary from small infiltrates to
extensive cavitation. Widespread involvement of the
lung with coalescing lesions produces tuberculous
pneumonia.
The pathogenicity of TB varies, with a third of untreated
patients dying from severe pulmonary TB within weeks or
months while the rest undergo spontaneous remission or
proceed along a chronic course often involving lung
fibrosis.

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis
This most commonly involves lymph nodes, the pleura,
genitourinary tract, bones and joints, meninges, liver,
gut and peritoneum.

the differential diagnosis in patients with febrile illnesses, cervical lymphadenopathy, or focal infiltrates
on CXR.
The CXR may show the typical picture of upper lobe
infiltrates, with or without cavitation. The diagnosis is
initially based on the finding of AAFB by microscopy
of a diagnostic specimen such as sputum or tissue
(e.g. lymph node biopsy) using either auramine staining and fluorescence microscopy or the more traditional
light microscopy of specimens using the Ziehl–Neelsen
stain.
Patients with suspected pulmonary TB normally
require three sputum specimens for AAFB smear and
mycobacterial culture and sensitivity. ‘Smear-positive’
patients have AAFB on sputum smear; they should be
considered infectious and isolated. Those without
AAFB on sputum smear (‘smear-negative’) are not infectious and do not need isolation, even if the sputum
subsequently grows MTB. Specimens are inoculated
on to Löwenstein–Jensen medium. Most species of
mycobacterium, including M. tuberculosis, are slowgrowing so that 4–8 weeks may be required before
growth is detected and antibiotic sensitivity can be
assessed. Newer molecular biological techniques can
confirm M. tuberculosis more quickly and give drug
sensitivities.
Other diagnostic tests for pulmonary TB include:
• Induced sputum by ultrasonic nebulization of hypertonic saline for patients unable to produce a sputum specimen spontaneously.
• Fibreoptic bronchoscopy with bronchial lavage
or transbronchial biopsy (especially with miliary
TB).

Pulmonary

When extrapulmonary TB is suspected, specimens of involved sites may include:

•
•
•
•
•
•

• Cerebrospinal fluid: tuberculous meningitis.
• Pleural fluid and pleural biopsy samples: pleural
disease.
• Bone marrow and liver biopsy culture: good diagnostic yield in disseminated (miliary) TB.
• Early morning urine: renal TB.

Cough: chronic and productive.
Chest pain.
Dyspnoea.
Haemoptysis.
Crepitations: involved areas during inspiration.
Wheeze: partial bronchial obstruction.

Extrapulmonary
This is dependent on the organ system affected. Common sites include
• Meningism, photophobia and reduced conscious
level – TB meningitis.
• Lymphadenopathy.
• Abscesses.
• Dysuria, frequency, epididymitis.

Diagnostic tests for tuberculosis
The key to the diagnosis of TB is a high index of suspicion, especially in at-risk groups. It should form part of

234

In all cases specimens are sent for AAFB microscopy,
stain and culture.
Positive tuberculin testing indicates exposure to
mycobacteria or vaccination and not active disease per
se and is best used in contact tracing and public health
screening. The Mantoux and Heaf tests are the two most
common methods. They involve intradermal injection
of purified protein derivative (PPD) and then observation of the response. Recent developments in interferon-gamma release assays have been approved by
NICE (NICE guidelines on clinical diagnosis and management of tuberculosis, and measures for its prevention and control – March 2011), particularly if the
Mantoux test is positive.

Pneumothorax
False negatives are possible in active TB, especially in
miliary TB or if the patient is immunosuppressed, e.g.
HIV (a defect in cell-mediated immunity).

Management
Uncomplicated TB is treated in the initial phase using at
least three drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide) for 2 months, then a continuation phase using
two drugs (rifampicin and isoniazid) for another 4
months. If drug-resistant TB is suspected, ethambutol
should be included until sensitivities are known. Treatment of extrapulmonary and drug-resistant TB requires
specialist involvement. Pyridoxine is usually started to
minimize the neurological side effects of isoniazid.
Second-line drugs available for infections caused
by resistant organisms, or when first-line drugs cause
unacceptable side effects, include cycloserine, newer
macrolides (e.g. clarithromycin) and quinolones (e.g.
ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin).
HINTS AND TIPS
Rifampicin turns urine red. Useful to assess compliance
with treatment.

TB is ‘notifiable’; you should contact the appropriate
public health authorities for contact tracing.
If adherence to treatment is a possible issue, then directly observed therapy, short course (DOTS) should be
employed in which medications are taken three times
per week under supervision.
Not all patients with TB need to be isolated. All patients with suspected drug-resistant TB should be isolated. Most hospitals would also isolate patients with
smear-positive sputum until 2 weeks of effective treatment has been given. Care should be taken to ensure
that TB patients do not come into contact with immunocompromised patients.

Monitoring treatment
Isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide are associated
with liver toxicity, and therefore hepatic function
should be checked before treatment with these drugs.
If this is normal, routine monitoring of hepatic function
is not needed. Renal function should also be checked
before treatment with antituberculous drugs and appropriate dosage adjustments made. Visual acuity should
be tested before ethambutol is used because it can cause
loss of visual acuity and visual field defects. Ishihara
charts can be used to assess red/ green colour blindness
due to optic neuropathy. All TB should be treated by a
specialist, usually a respiratory physician.

31

Control of tuberculosis
By far the best way to prevent TB is the rapid diagnosis of
infectious cases with appropriate treatment until cure.
Additional strategies include bacille Calmette–Guérin
(BCG) vaccination and preventive chemotherapy.

Vaccination
BCG was derived from an attenuated strain of M. bovis and
was first administered to humans in 1921. Many BCG vaccines are now available worldwide; all are derived from
the original strain but the vaccines vary in efficacy. The vaccine is safe and rarely causes serious complications.
It should not be given to HIV-positive patients.
BCG vaccination induces PPD reactivity but the magnitude of PPD skin test reactions after vaccination does
not predict the degree of protection afforded. In the most
recent NICE guidelines (2011), the UK Department of
Health recommends ‘vaccination of all neonates at
higher risk of TB, with opportunistic vaccination of older
children as necessary’. Routine BCG is no longer offered
to all PPD-negative children at the age of 12 years.

Preventive chemotherapy
A major component of TB control involves contact tracing, skin testing and the administration of isoniazid to
contacts at high risk of active disease.

PNEUMOTHORAX

Introduction
A pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural
space (i.e. between the visceral pleura covering the lung
and the parietal pleura covering the inside of the chest
wall). It has UK hospital admission rates of 6 in 100 000
and 17 in 100 000 for women and men, respectively.
Risk factors for pneumothorax include smoking, increased height, male sex, increasing age and underlying
lung disease. The following distinctions are made between the different types of pneumothorax:
• Spontaneous pneumothorax: occurs without trauma
to the thorax.
• Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: occurs in the
absence of lung disease.
• Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax: occurs in
the presence of pre-existing lung disease.
• Traumatic pneumothorax: penetrating or nonpenetrating chest injuries.
• Tension pneumothorax: the pressure in the pleural
space is positive throughout the respiratory cycle.

235

Respiratory disease
classify pneumothoraces as large or small, based on
the presence of a visible rim of air <2 cm or >2 cm
between the lung and chest wall on plain CXR.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is usually due to
the rupture of an apical pleural bleb that lies within
or immediately under the visceral pleura. Approximately 25% of patients with an initial primary spontaneous pneumothorax will have a recurrence.

Management
Clinical features

The initial treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax is aspiration. If the lung does not expand with aspiration, or if the patient has a recurrent pneumothorax,
chest drain insertion with underwater seal drainage is
indicated. Small-diameter Seldinger chest drains are
preferred for non-traumatic pneumothorax. Pleurodesis
or surgery by thoracoscopy or thoracotomy plus pleural
abrasion is almost 100% successful in preventing recurrence. Treatment algorithms are shown in Figs 31.12
and 31.13.

The patient may be in extremis if a large tension pneumothorax is present or it may be seen on routine chest
radiography in a patient with mild chest pain.
Clinical features of pneumothorax include:
•
•
•
•

Pleuritic chest pain on the affected side.
Shortness of breath.
Tachycardia.
Decreased expansion, vocal fremitus, hyperresonance and diminished breath sounds which
may be detected if the pneumothorax is large.

HINTS AND TIPS

A CXR will confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating a
line of visceral pleura with absent lung markings beyond the line. The diagnosis may prove more difficult
in secondary pneumothorax, especially if emphysematous bullae are present. In this case lateral X-rays or
CT may be indicated. The most recent UK guidelines

The top five causes of iatrogenic pneumothoraces
are transthoracic needle aspiration, subclavian central
line insertion, thoracocentesis, pleural biopsy and
mechanical ventilation.

PLEURAL EFFUSION
A pleural effusion is an accumulation of fluid in the
pleural space. The fluid is often described as being an
exudate or transudate, depending on its composition.

•
•
•
•

Hypoalbuminaemia.
Constrictive pericarditis.
Hypothyroidism.
Meigs’ syndrome – in conjunction with ovarian
fibroma.

Clinical features
Aetiology
Exudative effusions are due to increased capillary leak
and diminished fluid resorption:
• Parapneumonic effusion: ‘simple’ if pH >7.2 and
‘complicated’ if pH <7.2; empyema if frank pus on
aspiration.
• Malignancy.
• Pulmonary emboli.
• Rheumatoid arthritis.
• Mesothelioma.
• Pancreatitis.
Transudative effusions are due to decreased oncotic
pressure or elevated hydrostatic pressure:
• Left ventricular dysfunction.
• Cirrhotic liver disease.

The accumulation of fluid within the pleural space will
be asymptomatic until it is large enough to cause respiratory compromise or unless other symptoms lead to
respiratory assessment. Symptoms are breathlessness,
particularly on exertion, and sometimes chest pain.
The examination findings include decreased breath
sounds, stony dull percussion note, and decreased
expansion on the affected side. History should cover:
• Evidence of cardiac failure and ischaemic heart
disease.
• Evidence of recent pneumonia: empyema and a reactive effusion may develop, especially if symptoms of
infection persist.
• Evidence of malignancy: lung primary, metastatic
disease and mesothelioma. Always ask directly
about asbestos exposure.

237

Respiratory disease

Investigations
Imaging
• CXR will confirm the presence of an effusion and
whether it is bilateral or unilateral. It may show underlying malignancy, pleural plaques/thickening or
heart failure. A repeat CXR should be performed after aspiration or chest drain insertion.
• Ultrasound is a useful tool in visualizing pleural
fluid. Further to this, the British Thoracic Society
strongly recommends inserting chest drains under
direct ultrasound vision. The practice of ‘X marks
the spot’, where tap sites are marked in the Radiology
Department, is now discouraged.
• Contrast CT scanning may be required to further determine the underlying cause of the effusion.

Pleural fluid
A sample of the effusion should be obtained by pleural
aspiration. Its gross appearance should be noted and
then sent for the following tests:
• pH: this can be done on a blood gas machine. A pH
of <7.2 in conjunction with pneumonia implies an
infected pleural space.
• Protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): this
should be done with paired serum samples. Traditionally, effusions are divided into:
• exudative: protein >30 g/dL
• transudative: protein <30 g/dL. If the serum protein is low then this is a less useful cut-off and
Light’s criteria are more sensitive and specific.
These state that if one of the following is true then
the fluid is exudative:
• pleural fluid protein:serum protein >0.5
• pleural fluid LDH:serum LDH >0.6
• pleural fluid LDH >2/3 the upper serum reference range.
• Gram stain, culture and sensitivities: for bacterial infection. If there is suspicion of TB, then stain and culture for Mycobacterium spp. should be requested.
• Cytology: for malignancy and differential cell count.
Further investigations may include pleural biopsy, thoracoscop and bronchoscopy and is likely to need specialist involvement.

Management
The underlying diagnosis should be sought and then
treated. Many effusions will resolve with this alone,
particularly if due to cardiac failure. If the history and
fluid analysis suggest either empyema or complicated
parapneumonic effusion then it should be drained in
addition to antibiotic therapy. Drainage is usually

238

achieved by inserting a chest drain (Seldinger technique) in the safe triangle (4th to 6th intercostal space
anterior to mid axillary line). Fluid should be drained in
a controlled fashion at a rate no faster than 2 L/24 h.
If malignancy is confirmed and the effusion is causing
symptoms then drainage and pleurodesis with talc
should obliterate the pleural space, preventing
reaccumulation.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder
that presents as a multisystem disease, and occurs in 1
in 2500 live births in Caucasians; 1 person in 25 is a carrier. Signs and symptoms typically occur in childhood
but up to 5% of patients are diagnosed as adults.
Improvements in supportive therapy mean that the
median survival is now 40 years. The CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene is on chromosome
7; it regulates chloride and water movement across cell
membranes. Whilst there are more than 1500 known
mutations the D508 mutation accounts for over 70%
of cases.
CF is characterized by chronic airway infection that
ultimately leads to bronchiectasis, exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal and hepatic
dysfunction, abnormal sweat gland function and
urogenital dysfunction.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of CF rests on a combination of clinical
criteria, analysis of sweat chloride (the ‘sweat test’)
and increasingly by genotyping. Faecal elastase is a useful screening test for exocrine pancreatic function
impairment.

Treatment
This is best done by a multidisciplinary team based in a
specialist centre. Treatment strategies for CF are to
promote clearance of secretions and reverse bronchoconstriction (physiotherapy, mucolytics and bronchodilators), control infection in the lung (prophylactic
nebulized and IV antibiotics), vaccinate against influenza and pneumococcus, ensure adequate nutrition
(pancreatic enzyme and fat-soluble vitamin supplements), screen for diabetes and prevent intestinal
obstruction.
As irreversible complications arise, heart–lung transplantation may be an option for some. Gene therapy
remains elusive and far from clinical use.

Interstitial lung disease
COMMUNICATION
The transition from paediatric to adult care is difficult
for both patients and their parents. Teenage years are a
challenge without living with a condition such as cystic
fibrosis. Patients need to build relationships with a new
medical team at a time when they are becoming
independent adults. This may be hard for parents, who
have often spent most of their time caring for their child
and now feel they have no clear role. They may need
support in this transition.

BRONCHIECTASIS
Bronchiectasis is an abnormal and permanent dilatation of the bronchioles secondary to chronic infection
associated with the production of copious amounts of
purulent sputum. It can be focal, involving airways supplying a limited region of the lung, or diffuse, involving
airways in a more widespread distribution.

Aetiology
Bronchiectasis can be congenital. For example it is associated with conditions causing poor mucociliary clearance such as cystic fibrosis, Kartagener’s syndrome or
primary ciliary dyskinesia. In the past, bronchiectasis
was a complication of measles or pertussis infection.
Modern vaccination programmes have reduced the
incidence of these diseases and the complications dramatically. It is more common in those with impaired immune systems; adenovirus and influenza are the main
viral causes and infections with necrotizing organisms
(e.g. TB or anaerobes) remain important. Localized bronchial obstruction can also lead on to bronchiectasis.

Clinical features
Patients typically present with persistent or recurrent
cough and purulent sputum production. Intermittent
haemoptysis occurs in more than half of cases and
can cause massive bleeding. Physical examination of
the chest overlying an affected area may reveal any combination of coarse crepitations and wheeze, reflecting
the damaged airways containing significant secretions.
As with other chronic intrathoracic infections, clubbing
may be present.
Patients with severe disease and chronic hypoxaemia
may develop cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure. Amyloidosis can result from chronic infection
and inflammation, but it is now seldom seen.

31

Diagnosis
Chest radiography may show ‘tramline shadows’ due to
bronchial wall thickening. High-resolution CT (HRCT)
has replaced bronchography for definitive diagnosis.
Lung function and reversibility should be done by spirometry and sputum culture should guide antibiotic
therapy.

Management
Treatment involves regular (preferably twice-daily) postural drainage. Antibiotics should be used according to
organism sensitivities. Surgery is occasionally effective
for localized bronchiectasis. Appropriate treatment
should be started when a treatable cause is found (e.g.
antituberculous drugs for TB or steroids for ABPA).

INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE
Interstitial lung disease (ILD), also known as diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD), is a heterogeneous
group of disorders that have been variously classified.
Some of the terms used are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse parenchymal lung disease. They share
the fact that damage is a result of an inflammatory insult
to the lung that then leads to cellular proliferation and
scarring with chronic loss of lung function.

Aetiology
One way to begin thinking about this group of disorders
is to separate them into those with and those without a
known cause.

Known cause
• Environmental agents: asbestosis, silicosis, pneumoconiosis.
• Drugs: sulfasalazine, gold, amiodarone, methotrexate, oxygen, nitrofurantoin.
• Systemic disease: connective tissue disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
systemic sclerosis), neoplasia, vasculitides (Wegener’s
granulomatosis, Churg–Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis), sarcoidosis, inflammatory
bowel disease.

Unknown cause
• Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (usual interstitial
pneumonia (UIP)).
• Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.

Respiratory disease

Clinical features

Fig. 31.14 CXR stages of sarcoidosis.

Most present with non-productive cough, slowly progressive dyspnoea, fatigue, weight loss and occasionally
haemoptysis. The chest radiograph may show reticular
nodular shadowing and loss of lung volume. Careful
questioning of occupational and environmental risks,
travel, medications, past illness, smoking and family
history is important to find a cause. Examination may
show cyanosis, finger clubbing and bilateral fine end inspiratory crackles. As the disease progresses cor pulmonale may develop.

Investigations
These should include full blood count, ESR, urea and
electrolytes, calcium, liver function tests, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and autoantibodies
to look for a cause. If any are abnormal they should
be followed up.
CXR is often the first modality of imaging. In sarcoidosis the stages of the disease are classified according to
the appearance on the CXR (Fig. 31.14). Beyond this,
HRCT provides more detailed diagnostic and prognostic information. Other tests include pulmonary function
tests (usually restrictive pattern), bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy. Lung biopsy should be considered
to differentiate between the various subtypes of interstitial pneumonia. Only UIP can be accurately diagnosed
from HRCT.

Stage 3

Management

addressed. If ‘honeycomb’ changes are seen on the
HRCT then fibrosis is permanent. If ‘ground glass’
changes are seen then high-dose immunosuppression
with steroids and cyclophosphamide may be indicated
to attempt to prevent irreversible fibrosis. Treatment of
complications is as they develop and when end-stage referral for transplantation may be indicated.

Occupational lung disease
Many acute and chronic lung diseases are directly related to occupational exposure to inorganic and organic
dusts. A number of different clinical syndromes may result and these are listed in Fig. 31.15. They are important
as they are largely preventable through increased awareness and improved workplace conditions. Patients with
asbestosis, silicosis, pneumoconiosis and mesothelioma may be entitled to compensation.

Aspergillus and the lung
Aspergillus is a genus of fungi consisting of more than
several hundred of species. The fungi is responsible for
causing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA),
which is a combined type I and III hypersensitivity disorder. It occurs in patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis or
sinusitis. It is characterized by bronchospasm, peripheral
blood eosinophilia, Aspergillus precipitins and raised IgE
levels with pulmonary infiltrates. It can lead on to bronchiectasis. Treatment for exacerbations is with corticosteroids. The cause is the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.
ABPA is the most common example of the allergic
bronchopulmonary mycoses and is sometimes confused
with hypersensitivity pneumonitis because of the presence of precipitating antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus.
However, ABPA is an obstructive rather than a restrictive
lung disease and is associated with allergic (atopic)
asthma. The bronchiectasis associated with ABPA is
thought to result from a deposition of immune complexes in proximal airways. Adequate treatment usually
requires the long-term use of systemic glucocorticoids.
Aspergillus fumigatus can also cause invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients, e.g. neutropenia
post chemotherapy or HIV. Treatment is with amphotericin, itraconazole or voriconazole.
In the immunocompetent, pre-existing lung cavities,
for example secondary to TB or sarcoidosis, can be
colonized to form aspergillomas. Surgical resection
remains the most effective treatment.
Aspergillus clavatus causes a type of extrinsic allergic
alveolitis (EAA) also referred to as malt-worker’s lung.
Treatment is with oral steroids; if left untreated pulmonary fibrosis may develop.

HYPOVENTILATION SYNDROMES
AND SLEEP-RELATED
RESPIRATORY DISORDERS
Apnoea is defined as an intermittent cessation of respiratory airflow during sleep, lasting at least 10 s. The
most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing is
obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA); other hypoventilatory
disorders are much less common.

Classification

31

• Mixed apnoeas, which consist of a central apnoea
followed by an obstructive component.

Obstructive sleep apnoea–
hypopnoea syndrome
This is the combination of OSA and excessive daytime
sleepiness. The symptoms include snoring, poor concentration, unrefreshing restless sleep, daytime somnolence,
morning headaches, poor libido, and reduced cognitive
function. Risk factors are increasing age, male gender,
obesity, neck circumference, sedative drugs and alcohol.
COMMUNICATION
The history from patients with suspected obstructive
sleep apnoea is best obtained with their partner
present. The patient may be untroubled by their own
snoring. Partners may be affected more than patients;
you can gauge the impact of the problem on their
combined life. They also often describe apnoeas with
great accuracy!

Management
Treatment of mild obstructive sleep apnoea is by weight
reduction, avoidance of alcohol, improvement of nasal
patency, intraoral mandibular advancement devices
and avoidance of sleeping supine. Sleep hygiene advice
should be given by the clinician, helping encourage a
more restful night’s sleep. Moderate-to-severe cases are
best treated by nasal CPAP to splint open the upper airway during sleep and rarely with surgical intervention.

Other conditions
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
This condition is characterized by hypoventilation
associated with shallow inspiration (Pickwickian syndrome). The condition is often associated with obstructive sleep apnoea. The resulting episodes of hypoxia and
hypercapnia (defined as an increase of 1.3 kPa whilst
asleep) cause poor night-time sleep and in the long term
may cause cor pulmonale in one-third of patients.

Sleep apnoea is divided into three types:

Congenital central hypoventilation
syndrome

• Central sleep apnoea: apnoea with a patent upper airway. The cause can vary, e.g. where the neural drive to
all the respiratory muscles is transiently abolished.
• Obstructive sleep apnoea: apnoea despite continuing respiratory effort because of pharyngeal airway
occlusion.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, or
Ondine’s curse, is a respiratory condition that, if left
untreated, is fatal. It normally presents at birth but
may be secondary to significant neurological trauma.
The condition is characterized by episodes of central
apnoea with cyanois secondary to autonomic failure

241

Respiratory disease
at the level of the brainstem. It is a rare condition
(1/200 000 live births) and may be associated with
Hirschsprung’s disease, neuroblastoma and dysphagia.
Treatment used to involve tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. More recently biphasic cuirass ventilation and phrenic nerve pacing have been successfully
used to manage the condition.

ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
SYNDROME
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by severe respiratory failure due to marked lung
inflammatory response and capillary leak.

Aetiology
The most common stimulus is sepsis; others include
trauma, burns, pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy, blood transfusions, cardiopulmonary
bypass, emboli and near drowning. Hypoxaemia results
from non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.
It is defined by four criteria:
• Acute onset.
• New bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography (see
Fig. 31.16).
• No evidence of heart failure or pulmonary artery
occlusion pressure <18 mmHg.
• Refractory hypoxaemia: PO2: FiO2 <200.

Management
ARDS should always be managed on intensive care and
should be divided as follows.
• Respiratory support: in early ARDS CPAP may be
sufficient although more often than not patients will
require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Recent advances include ‘lung protective’ ventilation
by minimizing tidal volumes and airway pressures;
this may mean accepting hypercapnia. Positive
end-expiratory pressure improves oxygenation and
allows the FiO2 to be lowered. Fluid balance is controlled to try to maintain PO2 by limiting extravascular lung water without affecting other organ systems.
Other strategies, including prone positioning, highfrequency oscillatory ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide and the place of corticosteroids, remain the subject of research and debate.
• Cardiovascular support: ARDS is often associated
with multiorgan distress syndrome (MODS or multiorgan failure). Invasive haemodynamic monitoring
such as arterial and central venous lines are used
to monitor fluid balance, blood pressure and potentially cardiac output (PICCO). If persistent

hypovolaemia exists in the presence of adequate
fluid resuscitation, ionotropes such as noradrenaline
(norepinephrine) or dobutamine may be indicated.
• Sepsis: ARDS is most commonly triggered by sepsis.
The ‘sepsis six’ care bundle should have been started
at the time of admission. Antibiotic treatment should
be guided by sensitivities. Remember that that the
source does not have to be from the lungs to cause
ARDS – a patient presenting with sepsis secondary
to an E. coli urinary tract infection may develop ARDS.

Prognosis
This remains poor: overall mortality is approximately
41–46% (Intensive Care National Audit & Research
Centre). It depends on the nature of the precipitating
event and the degree to which organ failure develops.
Most survivors have residual impairment of lung function, both mechanical and diffusing capacity with diminished exercise capacity.

OESOPHAGEAL DISORDERS

Hiatus hernia
This is the herniation of part of the stomach, commonly
the proximal part, into the chest cavity. Hiatus hernias
are generally asymptomatic but may be associated with
acid reflux causing dyspeptic symptoms (see below and
Ch. 9). Since hiatus hernias are associated with increased body mass index (BMI), weight loss is advised.
They rarely require treatment other than symptomatic
management for acid reflux (see below). Occasionally
surgery is indicated, which involves wrapping the fundus of the stomach around the lower oesophageal
sphincter (Nissen’s fundoplication procedure). There
are two types of hiatus hernia.

Sliding hiatus hernia
Very common (30% of over-50s). Gastro-oesophageal
junction ‘slides’ through oesophageal hiatus into the
thorax. Sliding hiatus hernias account for 80% of hiatus
hernias.

Rolling (or para-oesophageal) hiatus hernia
The lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) remains below the
diaphragm but part of the stomach rolls up into the chest
next to the oesophagus. Occasionally, this results in gastric
volvulus, resulting in severe pain and requiring surgery.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
The LOS normally prevents significant acid reflux into
the oesophagus. Other anti-reflux mechanisms include

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00032-4

the intra-abdominal section of the oesophagus, the
diaphragmatic crura and the folds of gastric mucosa.
These mechanisms fail in gastro-oesophageal reflux
disease (GORD). The factors predisposing to reflux
are outlined in Ch. 9.

Clinical features
These are described in Ch. 9. It is important to note particularly how the presentation may be difficult to distinguish from that of angina (including non-specific ECG
changes), and how atypical symptoms such as nocturnal
asthma or laryngeal discomfort may occur. Severe oesophagitis may be associated with occult and/or overt gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and iron-deficiency anaemia.

Investigations
These are outlined in Ch. 9. Endoscopy is useful for
demonstrating oesophagitis, peptic strictures and Barrett’s oesophagus (see below) and allows biopsies to
be taken. Endoscopy is indictaed in those >55 years
of age, symptoms lasting >4 weeks, dysphagia, persistent symptoms despite treatment, and weight loss. To
confirm the diagnosis, 24-h intraluminal pH monitoring is the definitive test, but it is not often required, as
explained in Ch. 9. NICE guidance on the management
of GORD is in development.
In adhering to the guidelines summarized in Fig. 9.3,
a number of patients with GORD (without a firm diagnosis) will undergo Helicobacter pylori eradication. However, H. pylori infection is just as common in the normal
population and probably has no specific role in this
condition. As a matter of fact eradicating H. pylori in
GORD may make symptoms worse; H. pylori is not
implicated in GORD.

245

Gastrointestinal and liver disease

Management

Oesophageal motility disorders

Patients should avoid tight clothes, stop smoking, avoid
aggravating foods and drinks, and lose weight if overweight. Patients should be advised to prop themselves
up in bed with pillows or put a block under the end
of the bed to avoid slipping down. Drugs that affect
oesophageal motility (e.g. nitrates or tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists) should be
avoided if possible.
A number of drugs can be used: antacids (including
alginate preparations that form a ‘foam raft’), H2receptor antagonists (e.g. ranitidine), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; e.g. omeprazole) and prokinetics such as
metoclopramide. Therapy aims to provide symptom relief. Treatment for 4 weeks is a reasonable starting
course and then therapy should be titrated to an agent
that controls the symptoms at the lowest cost.
Surgery is only indicated if symptoms are severe despite maximum medical management and there is pH
monitoring evidence of active acid reflux during symptomatic episodes. Careful candidate selection is absolutely crucial.

These can give rise to dyspepsia (see Ch. 9), pain, dysphagia and odynophagia, and regurgitation. Causes
include old age, diabetes mellitus, neurological disorders affecting the brainstem, systemic sclerosis, achalasia
and diffuse oesophageal spasm. The diagnosis can be suggested by chest X-ray or barium swallow appearances, but
oesophageal manometry is the definitive investigation.
Treatment options include anti-spasmodic drugs, botulinum toxin injection, balloon dilatation and surgery.

Complications
Benign oesophageal stricture
This usually occurs in patients aged over 60 years old
and causes intermittent dysphagia. The stricture is
usually dilated endoscopically but surgery is rarely required. Acid secretion is controlled pharmacologically.

Barrett’s oesophagus
This is intestinal metaplasia from squamous to columnar epithelium following long-standing acid reflux and,
although visible macroscopically, is confirmed histologically following endoscopic biopsy. It is particularly
significant as it is premalignant for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (see below).

Eosinophilic oesophagitis
This is a hypersensitive inflammatory condition of the
oesophagus. The condition more commonly affects
children and young adults and presents with symptoms
of dyspepsia, dysphagia and food impaction. The diagnosis is based on the histological appearance of endoscopic biopsies. Treatment involves allergy testing and
allergen avoidance. Swallowed liquid cortisone may
help. Recent evidence suggests a role for proton pump
inhibitors in symptom control and potential remission
of the underlying pathology. Severe strictures may require endoscopic balloon dilatation. GORD also leads
to eosinophil infiltrate, so can be difficult to distinguish.

246

Achalasia
Achalasia is failure of relaxation at the distal end of the
oesophagus due to an underlying neuromuscular problem, commonly the ganglionic cells in the myenteric
plexus. Because there is a functional obstruction distally, it causes progressive dilatation, tortuosity, incoordination of peristalsis and often hypertrophy of the
proximal oesophagus. The condition affects males and
females equally and has a peak incidence in the third
and fourth decades of life. Diagnosis is on barium swallow (or a water contrast swallow if there is risk of aspiration) and motility studies using monometry probes.
The condition is incurable but management with botulinum toxin or endoscopic balloon dilatation can provide symptomatic relieve. Occasionally surgery
(Heller’s cardiomyotomy) can be performed to permanently dilate the lower 3–4 cm of the oesophagus. This
procedure, however, may lead to reflux oesophagitis.

Oesophageal cancer
The incidence in the UK is 5–10 in 100 000 and rising
(unlike gastric carcinoma) but is higher in China
and parts of Africa. It is commoner in men, heavy
drinkers and smokers. Predisposing factors include
Plummer–Vinson syndrome, achalasia, coeliac disease
and tylosis (hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles).
In general, squamous cell carcinomas occur in the
upper and mid-oesophagus. Adenocarcinoma typically
arises in columnar epithelium of the lower oesophagus.
Barrett’s oesophagus increases the risk of adenocarcinoma by 40-fold.

Clinical features
The incidence peaks in the seventh decade. General features of malignancy include weight loss, anorexia and
lassitude. Local features include dysphagia (initially to
solids progressing to liquids), retrosternal pain and odynophagia. Direct invasion of surrounding structures
and regional lymph node involvement are common.
Metastases to other organs and distant lymph nodes
may occur.

Gastroduodenal disorders

32

Investigations

Clinical features

Endoscopy with biopsy, and barium swallow are the
main diagnostic investigations. CT and/or MRI scanning, liver ultrasound and bronchoscopy are commonly
performed as part of the staging process. Occasionally a
staging laparoscopy is performed if there is a significant
infra-diaphragmatic component.

Dyspepsia is the commonest mode of presentation and
the symptoms are described in Ch. 9. They are unreliable for separating duodenal ulcer from gastric ulcer.
Anorexia, vomiting and weight loss should lead to the
suspicion of gastric carcinoma. If there is persistent
and severe pain, complications such as perforation or
penetration into other organs should be considered.
Examination reveals epigastric tenderness. A mass
suggests carcinoma, and a succussion splash may suggest pyloric obstruction.

Management
Surgery is considered, depending on the tumour stage/
grade and the fitness of the patient, but it carries a high
morbidity and mortality. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may play a role. Often palliation is the only option,
and this may include endoscopic dilatation, stent placement, laser photocoagulation and/or radiotherapy with
the aim of maintaining patency of the oesophageal lumen. Overall survival is poor, at around 5% at 5 years.

GASTRODUODENAL DISORDERS

Gastroduodenitis and peptic
ulcer disease
Acute gastritis and ulceration can result from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, steroids,
alcohol, smoking, or severe stress or burns (Curling’s ulcer). Chronic gastritis complicates H. pylori infection,
autoimmune gastritis (e.g. pernicious anaemia) and
chronic NSAID use. Most chronic gastritis is asymptomatic but may be a risk factor for malignant change. Erosive duodenitis is part of the spectrum of duodenal ulcer
disease.
Peptic ulcer disease most commonly occurs in the
duodenum, followed by the stomach, oesophagus
and jejunum in Zollinger–Ellison syndrome or after a
gastroenterostomy. It may occur in a Meckel’s diverticulum with ectopic gastric mucosa. Its prevalence is
15–20% and it is commoner in men. The incidence increases with age.
Duodenal ulceration is associated with H. pylori infection in 95% of cases and NSAIDs are implicated in
most others. Eighty per cent of gastric ulcers are H.
pylori-associated and the remainder are usually due to
NSAIDs. It is important to remember that gastric ulceration is a mode of presentation of gastric cancer.

Investigations
These are described in Ch. 9. Gastroscopy (or rarely a
barium meal) is the investigation of choice. All gastric
ulcers should be biopsied to exclude malignancy but duodenal ulcers are nearly always benign; biopsies should
be taken for H. pylori at endoscopy. Acid secretion status
may be assessed if Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is suspected, by measuring fasting gastrin level, ideally off PPI.

Management
The patient should be advised to modify exacerbating
factors such as smoking, diet and alcohol. NSAIDs
should be stopped if not absolutely necessary and the
use of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) antagonists may be
considered in accordance with national guidelines
(see Further reading). Antacids, H2-antagonists and proton pump inhibitors all help with symptomatic relief.
More specific therapies aimed at cure are described
below.

Duodenal ulcer
H. pylori eradication should be undertaken using a locally approved regime. If the patient is rendered asymptomatic, no further follow-up is required. If symptoms
recur, the breath test should be repeated; if positive, reeradication is attempted; treatment failure may indicate
poor compliance or antibiotic resistance; if negative, clinical re-evaluation and investigation is required. In the minority of patients who are H. pylori-negative, culprit drugs
such as NSAIDs should be stopped where possible and
antisecretory therapy titrated to symptoms. Patients
who are persistently H. pylori-positive can be cultured
and sensitivities determined to successfully eradicate.

Gastric ulcer
HINTS AND TIPS
Make sure to specifically ask about over-the-counter
medicine; aspirin and NSAIDs are an important cause of
gastroduodenitis and peptic ulcer disease.

If H. pylori-positive, eradication should be undertaken
followed by antisecretory therapy for 2 months. If H.
pylori-negative, 2 months of antisecretory therapy should
be given. In all cases, NSAID use should be discontinued. If this is not possible, consideration should be
given to the use of maintenance therapy with a proton

247

Gastrointestinal and liver disease
pump inhibitor, and the use of COX-2 inhibitors (see
Further reading).
All gastric ulcers should be followed up with endoscopy/biopsy until completely healed due to the risk of
an underlying malignancy. If present for longer than
6 months, surgery should be considered.

Surgery
Surgery is usually considered when medical treatment
has failed, or for complications that include persistent
haemorrhage, perforation or pyloric stenosis. Operations
include partial gastrectomy or highly selective vagotomy
and pyloroplasty (hardly ever done now). Haemorrhage
may be controlled endoscopically by injection with
adrenaline (epinephrine) or diathermy, laser photocoagulation or heat probe and application of endoscopically
placed clips. Perforations are usually oversewn with an
omental plug.
Complications of surgery include:
•
•
•
•
•

Recurrent ulceration.
Abdominal fullness.
Bilious vomiting.
Diarrhoea.
Dumping syndrome: fainting and sweating after eating, possibly due to food of high osmotic potential
being dumped into the jejunum and causing hypovolaemia because of rapid fluid shifts. ‘Late dumping’
is due to hypoglycaemia and occurs 1–3 h after taking
food. This is a result of partial gastrectomy, which is
rarely performed now.

Metabolic complications include:
•
•
•
•

Weight loss.
Malabsorption.
Bacterial overgrowth (blind loop syndrome).
Anaemia, usually due to iron deficiency following
hypochlorhydria and stomach resection.

Complications
The three main complications secondary to peptic ulceration are bleeding, perforation and pyloric stenosis. Perforation is more common in duodenal ulcers than in
gastric ulcers. Pyloric stenosis may also be prepyloric
or in the duodenum. It occurs because of oedema surrounding the ulcer or from scar formation on healing.
The patient often has projectile vomiting with food
ingested up to 24 h previously. There may be visible
peristalsis and a succussion splash. Vomiting may lead
to dehydration and a metabolic alkalosis.
Fluid and electrolyte replacement is needed, as is gastric aspiration with a nasogastric tube. Surgery is indicated if the patient does not settle with conservative
management.

248

Upper gastrointestinal
haemorrhage
HINTS AND TIPS
A careful history may help with the diagnosis in
haematemesis. In Mallory–Weiss oesophageal tears,
violent retching or vomiting occurs and the first
contents are usually free of blood.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding presents commonly with melaena and/or haematemesis. The pathology can range from insidious loss from gastritis with no
apparent blood loss to catastrophic, life-threatening
oesophageal variceal bleeding. Emergency resuscitative
measures may therefore be needed before a full assessment is made. The approach to taking an appropriate
history, examination and developing a complete differential diagnosis is discussed in Ch. 10. This section discusses the emergency management of significant upper
GI bleeding. All patients with a significant bleed should
be admitted to hospital. The vast majority will stop
bleeding spontaneously within 48 h.

Management
General
It is essential to establish early whether or not the
patient is haemodynamically compromised. In the
shocked patient, fluid resuscitation to correct haemodynamic instability is a priority:
• Ensure the airway is protected and administer highflow oxygen. Two large-bore cannulae should be inserted into large veins (e.g. antecubital fossa); this enables
blood samples to be taken as advised in Ch. 10.
• IV crystalloid or colloid should be given while awaiting cross-matched blood. If bleeding is profuse,
O-negative blood may be used.
• Clotting should be corrected with platelets, vitamin K
or fresh frozen plasma as required.
• Insert a urinary catheter to monitor urine output.
Consider central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring
if the patient is unstable – but be aware of the risks of
this procedure if clotting is deranged.
• Fluid resuscitation should be titrated to the pulse
rate, blood pressure, urine output, CVP and clinical
assessment of fluid status.
If there are no signs of shock and the patient is not anaemic, they may be managed ‘conservatively’ (i.e. bed rest,
nil by mouth and close monitoring of the pulse, blood
pressure and fluid balance). Blood should be grouped
and saved, and normal saline should be given
intravenously.

Gastroduodenal disorders
Once the patient is stable, endoscopy should be carried out within 4 h if variceal bleeding is suspected or
within 12–24 h if the patient was shocked on admission
or has significant comorbidity. Other patients can wait
longer; there is no evidence that these individuals will
benefit from starting a PPI prior to endoscopy. The
cause for the bleed will be apparent in over 80% of cases
on endoscopy.
If there is active bleeding, adrenaline (epinephrine)
can be injected, or bleeding vessels coagulated with a
heat probe or with laser therapy. Proton pump inhibitors are given to patients with bleeding ulcers and then
they are managed as described above.
Surgery is indicated if it is not possible to control the
bleeding with medical management, especially for persistent or recurrent bleeding, although this is now becoming less common. It is more often carried out in
the elderly and for those with gastric ulcers compared
to duodenal ulcers.
Bleeds from gastric ulcers carry twice the mortality of
bleeds from duodenal ulcers. The Rockall score is used
as a prognostic indicator that has a pre- and postendoscopy component (see Fig. 10.4). Patients must
be monitored very closely for re-bleeding as this has a
mortality of 40% and is often an indication for surgery.

Management of bleeding oesophageal varices
The cause of oesophageal varices is discussed later in
this chapter. Resuscitative procedures, correction of coagulation and endoscopy should be carried out as
above:
• Fluid resuscitation should aim to maintain a systolic
blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg (and urine output
greater than 30 mL/h). Over-aggressive fluid replacement may increase the chance of a re-bleed.
• Prophylactic antibiotics should be commenced and
continued for 1 week.
• Vasoconstrictor therapy is used to reduce splanchnic
blood flow and therefore portal pressure. Terlipressin (vasopressin analogue) is the agent of choice.
• Urgent endoscopy allows acute variceal banding (or
occasionally sclerotherapy). This arrests bleeding in
80% of cases and reduces early re-bleeding.
• Measures to prevent hepatic encephalopathy should
be started, which include emptying the bowel with
enemas or lactulose.
• If the bleeding continues, a Sengstaken–Blakemore
tube can be passed through the oesophagus, with
balloons to compress the varices at the oesophagogastric junction. The patient ought to be intubated
and sedated for this, to minimize risk, and its use
should be restricted to those in whom massive
bleeding is not controlled by initial therapy and
who are awaiting definitive treatment.
• Options in patients who continue to bleed include
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt,

32

which is performed by interventional radiologists/
hepatologists to lower portal pressure by creating a
shunt to the systemic circulation, or surgery. Surgical
procedures include oesophageal transection with
anastomosis, transthoracic transoesophageal ligation
of varices, and gastric transection with reanastomosis.
These operations are hardly ever done these days.
Approximately 20% of those bleeding from varices for
the first time will die. The risk of recurrence is approximately 80% in the next 2 years. Adverse prognostic factors are jaundice, ascites, hypoalbuminaemia and
encephalopathy (i.e. other features of decompensated
liver failure).

Gastric carcinoma
The incidence of gastric carcinoma is 23 in 100 000 and
it is commoner in men and the elderly. There is a link
between gastric cancer and H. pylori, which may explain
the higher prevalence in lower socioeconomic groups.
Suggested dietary links include alcohol, spicy foods
and nitrates, which are converted to nitrosamines by
bacteria. It occurs more often in Japan because of the
higher fish intake resulting in a high level of nitrosamines. It is commoner in smokers, in patients with
achlorhydria and in patients with blood group A.
Other predisposing conditions include pernicious
anaemia, chronic gastritis with atrophy, areas of intestinal metaplasia and partial gastrectomy.
Most cancers are adenocarcinomas and affect mainly
the pylorus and antrum. They are polypoid or ulcerating lesions with rolled edges. Less common are
leather-bottle-type adenocarcinomas (linitis plastica).

Clinical features
General features of malignancy may be present (weight
loss, anorexia, etc.). Local features may include dyspeptic symptoms (see Ch. 9), nausea and vomiting, GI
bleeding or iron-deficiency anaemia, and a palpable
epigastric mass or tenderness. Metastatic features include Virchow’s node in the left supraclavicular fossa
and metastases to liver, bones, brain and lung. Transcoelomic spread may occur (e.g. to ovaries, Krukenberg’s tumour). Paraneoplastic features include
dermatomyositis and acanthosis nigricans.

Investigations
Blood tests include a full blood count (FBC) to look for
signs of chronic blood loss, and liver function tests
(LFTs) for possible metastases. Diagnosis is made on
gastroscopy with multiple biopsies. Endoscopic ultrasound and CT/MRI scanning is used for staging.
Occasionally, a diagnostic laparoscopy is indicated to
assess spread from locally advanced tumours.

249

Gastrointestinal and liver disease

Management
Surgery is the only curative option. Depending on the position and extent of the tumour the patient may have a
partial or total gastrectomy. More recent developments
have allowed for endoscopic mucosal resection for earlystage cancers. Nonetheless, the overall 5-year survival is
poor at approximately 10%. The 5-year survival with gastrectomy is around 20%. Metastases contraindicate curative surgery in up to 60% of cases and palliation may
involve the use of drugs, surgery and radiotherapy.

pain and tetany (hypocalcaemia), oedema, leuconychia
and ascites (hypoproteinaemia) and peripheral neuropathy (vitamin B deficiency). There may also be signs
of the underlying disease (e.g. jaundice or lymphadenopathy with lymphomas). Causes of malabsorption
are given in Fig. 32.1.
The range of investigations to be considered has been
dealt with in Ch. 11.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumour
A gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is a mesenchymal tumour of the GI tract that is commonly benign
(70–80%), but may be malignant. The tumours are
mostly solitary and can occur anywhere in the GI tract
from the oesophagus to the rectum. Malignant spread
tends to be intra-abdominal and to the liver; very rarely
the tumour metastases to lungs or bone. Clinical features are dependent on tumour size and location, but
often include nausea, pain and occult bleeding. GIST
is unusual under the age of 50 and is associated with
neurofibromatosis type I. Treatment is surgical local excision with or without imatinib (a monoclonal antibody to the tumour-specific antigen c-kit protein).
Two-year survival with advanced disease is now 80%
due to advances in monoclonal technologies.

SMALL BOWEL DISORDERS

Malabsorption
The clinical features of malabsorption have been outlined in Ch. 11 and include anorexia, weight loss and

Chronic pancreatitis
This is a common cause of malabsorption and is discussed later in this chapter.

Coeliac disease
Coeliac disease is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Gluten
is present in wheat, barley and rye. In this disease, there
is an abnormal duodenal and jejunal mucosa leading to
malabsorption. The condition improves with a glutenfree diet but relapses when gluten is reintroduced.
Coeliac disease is commoner in Europeans, with an
incidence of approximately 1 in 100 in the UK. It is commoner in females and can occur at any age. There is an
increased incidence within families, and it is associated
with HLA-B8 and DR3. It is also associated with a blistering subepidermal eruption of the skin (dermatitis
herpetiformis). The aetiology is thought to be due to
alpha-gliadin, a peptide present in gluten, which is injurious to the small bowel mucosa. Immunogenic mechanisms and possibly environmental factors (e.g. viral
infections) may also play a role.

Fig. 32.1 Causes of malabsorption.

Cause

Examples

Biliary insufficiency

Primary biliary cirrhosis, biliary obstruction, cholestyramine, ileal resection (impaired
enterohepatic circulation)

Pancreatic insufficiency

Chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, cystic fibrosis, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome
(pancreatic enzymes inactive at low pH due to gastric acid hypersecretion)

Abnormalities of the small
bowel mucosa

Coeliac disease, Whipple’s disease, tropical sprue, radiation enteritis, small bowel
resection, brush border enzyme deficiency (e.g. lactase deficiency), drugs (e.g.
metformin), amyloid, hypogammaglobulinaemia (also predisposes to infection),
intestinal lymphangiectasia, lymphoma, abetalipoproteinaemia, ischaemia

Bacterial overgrowth

Especially in diverticula and postoperative blind loops. Also in dilated areas of small
bowel in systemic sclerosis

Infection

Giardiasis, diphyllobothriasis, strongyloidiasis, tuberculosis

Intestinal hurry

Postgastrectomy dumping, postvagotomy, gastrojejunostomy, short bowel syndrome
(multiple resections, e.g. Crohn’s disease)

250

Small bowel disorders

Clinical features
Symptoms may be non-specific (e.g. lethargy and malaise). There is usually a history of diarrhoea or steatorrhoea, with abdominal discomfort, and there may be
weight loss. Other features include mouth ulcers, anaemia and less commonly tetany, osteomalacia, neuropathies, myopathies and hyposplenism. Nonetheless, the
disease is mainly picked up by blood testing in patients
with anaemia or ‘IBS’.
There is an increased incidence of autoimmune disease
(e.g. thyroid disease and insulin-dependent diabetes).
Coeliac disease may be complicated by GI lymphoma
and gastric or oesophageal carcinoma.

Investigations
The following investigations are important in the patient with coeliac disease:
• Anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and anti endomysial antibodies are tests of choice, mainly TTG.
• Duodenal biopsy: villous atrophy with chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria.
• FBC: may show anaemia (folate or iron deficiency –
vitamin B12 deficiency is rare as the stomach and terminal ileum are not involved).
• Blood film may show Howell–Jolly bodies or other
signs of hyposplenism.
• Serum albumin: hypoalbuminaemia.
• A DEXA scan is required once diagnosed, as patients
are at risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis

Management
NICE have published guidelines on the management of
coeliac disease (May 2009). The condition improves on
a gluten-free diet. Deficient vitamins are replaced. If
symptoms persist, it may be that the patient is not complying with the diet. Occasionally, steroid treatment is
added to reduce the inflammatory response. A high index of suspicion for the complications mentioned
above should be maintained.

Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s disease is a common cause for malabsorption
and is discussed in detail later in this chapter.

Bacterial overgrowth
Although bacterial overgrowth may occur spontaneously, especially in the elderly, it is normally associated
with a structural abnormality of the small intestine (e.g.
in diverticula or postoperative blind loops). Aspiration
of jejunal contents reveals Escherichia coli or Bacteroides
spp. in concentrations greater than 106/mL as part of a

32

mixed flora. The bacteria can deconjugate bile salts,
which can be detected in aspirates; this deficiency of
conjugated bile salts leads to steatorrhoea. The bacteria
also metabolize vitamin B12, leading to its deficiency.

Management
Underlying small bowel lesions should be corrected if
possible. The condition may respond to intermittent
courses of metronidazole or ciprofloxacin. Vitamin
B12 should be given (1 mg intramuscularly for 5 days).

Tropical sprue
In this condition, there is severe malabsorption, usually
accompanied by diarrhoea and malnutrition. It occurs
in most of Asia and the Caribbean. The aetiology is
unknown but it is thought to be infective, potentially
caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli. Jejunal histology
shows partial villous atrophy.

Management
Severe cases may need IV fluids and electrolytes, and
replacement of nutritional and vitamin deficiencies.
Patients often improve when they leave an endemic
area. Patients may be helped with tetracycline 250 mg
6-hourly and folic acid.

Whipple’s disease
This is a rare cause of malabsorption, usually affecting
men over 50 years old. As well as steatorrhoea, there
is fever, weight loss, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy and
sometimes involvement of the heart, lung and brain.
Histologically, cells of the lamina propria are replaced
by macrophages that contain periodic acid–Schiff positive glycoprotein granules. The organism responsible is
Tropheryma whippelii. Treatment is with antibiotics (e.g.
tetracycline or co-trimoxazole).

Neuroendocrine tumours of
the bowel
Although these are all very rare, they are sometimes discussed in examinations. Carcinoid tumours often occur
in the small bowel, and the other tumours discussed below arise in the pancreas. They are discussed in this section for convenience and because they often affect the
small bowel.
They arise from APUD (amine precursor uptake and
decarboxylation) cells, which secrete a number of hormones, e.g. gastrin, glucagon and vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP). Pancreatic endocrine tumours may occur
with other endocrine tumours as part of MEN syndromes (see Ch. 35).

251

Gastrointestinal and liver disease

Carcinoid tumours
These tumours originate from the enterochromaffin cell
(neural crest) of the intestine. They may appear in the
appendix (45%), terminal ileum (30%), rectum (20%)
or other site in the GI tract, ovaries, testis or the lung.
They have malignant potential; 80% of large tumours
produce metastases. Presentations include appendicitis,
GI obstruction and, in 5% of cases, the carcinoid
syndrome.

Carcinoid syndrome
This only occurs when liver metastases are present as the
level of the metabolites is otherwise controlled by first
pass metabolism in the liver. Clinical features include
flushing (which may be prolonged and lead to telangiectases), abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bronchospasm,
and oedema associated with pulmonary stenosis or
tricuspid regurgitation. Symptoms are due to the release
of pharmacologically active mediators (e.g. 5hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), prostaglandins and kinins).

Diagnosis

from a raised fasting serum gastrin level; the gastric acid
output is also raised. Treatment is by removal of the primary tumour (provided there is no evidence of metastases) and omeprazole or octreotide.

Insulinomas
These are tumours of the pancreatic islet beta cells; 5%
are malignant and 5% are multiple. The patient presents
with recurrent or fasting hypoglycaemia, which may
manifest in bizarre behaviour, epilepsy, dementia or
confusion. The diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of hypoglycaemia in association with inappropriate and excessive insulin secretion. Raised C-peptide
levels are found in insulinoma but not in exogenous
insulin injection. Treatment is by surgical excision of
the tumour. If surgery is not feasible, diazoxide or
octreotide are useful. Fasting hypoglycaemia is discussed in Ch. 35.

VIPomas

This is by measurement of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5-HIAA) in 24-h urine collection. More recent developments include plasma chromogranin A measurements
to assess tumour size and 111indium ocreotide scitigraphy or PET scans to aid in tumour localization. Abdominal CT scan or laparoscopy/laparotomy may be needed
to localize the tumour.

These tumours release VIP, which produces intestinal
secretions leading to watery diarrhoea, hypokalaemia
and sometimes achlorhydria. Diagnosis is by high serum levels of VIP. The tumour should be resected if possible. Octreotide is useful for controlling symptoms.

Treatment

These are tumours of the alpha cells of the pancreas,
which release glucagon. Symptoms include diabetes, diarrhoea, a necrolytic migratory erythematous rash,
weight loss, anaemia and glossitis.

Food and drink that precipitate flushing should be
avoided (e.g. alcohol, coffee). Surgery is best for localized tumours and may be curative. Octreotide alleviates
flushing and diarrhoea. Other useful drugs include cyproheptadine (an antihistamine with 5-HT and calcium
channel blocking properties) and methysergide (which
also blocks 5-HT). Other procedures include enucleation of liver metastases, hepatic artery ligation, embolization and 5-fluorouracil injection.

Prognosis
The median survival is 5–8 years after diagnosis; 3 years
of metastases are present. However, some patients survive for >15 years, even with metastases.

Gastrinoma
This is usually due to a gastrin-secreting pancreatic adenoma, which stimulates excessive acid production, leading to multiple recurrent ulcers in the stomach and
duodenum. Approximately half are malignant and
10% are multiple. It is usually part of Zollinger–Ellison
syndrome.
Patients commonly get diarrhoea due to the low pH
in the upper intestine and steatorrhoea due to the inactivation of lipase by the low pH. The diagnosis is made

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL
DISEASE

HINTS AND TIPS
Extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel
disease are A PIE SAC: Aphthous ulcers, Pyoderma
gangrenosum, Iritis, Erythema nodosum, Sclerosing
cholangitis, Arthritis and Clubbing.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are collectively
termed idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
It is likely that these conditions represent a spectrum
of disease resulting from a combination of genetic
and environmental factors, although they typically differ in their natural history and response to treatment
(Fig. 32.2).

Aetiology and pathogenesis
The primary cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown, although 10% of patients have a first-degree relative with
ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. It may result from a
genetically determined, inappropriately severe and/or
prolonged inflammatory response to a dietary or microbial product. Abnormalities of colonic epithelial cell
metabolism have also been reported in ulcerative colitis, and there are associations with certain drugs such
as NSAIDs and antibiotics, and with stress, although
the significance is uncertain.
There may be a history of atopy, autoimmune disease
(e.g. chronic active hepatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus) and the presence of circulating immune complexes and antibodies to colonocytes and neutrophils
(pANCA) in ulcerative colitis.

Ulcerative colitis
This is an idiopathic chronic relapsing inflammatory
disease that always involves the rectum and extends

proximally in continuity to affect a variable length of colon. Although the small bowel is spared there may be
some ‘backwash ileitis’. It is commoner in the Western
world, with a prevalence of approximately 150 in
100 000 and an incidence of about 10 in 100 000 annually, and is maximal at 15–40 years of age. There is no
major sex difference.

Clinical features
The disease may present with a single mild episode followed by remission for a prolonged period, or progressive symptoms over months with general ill health and
chronic diarrhoea, or as an acute severe episode. In general, the severity of diarrhoea and systemic upset depends on the extent of the disease and depth of
mucosal ulceration.
Active subtotal or total ulcerative colitis causes frequent bloody diarrhoea, often with fever, malaise, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, anaemia and
tachycardia. With proctitis, characteristic symptoms

253

Gastrointestinal and liver disease
are rectal bleeding and mucus discharge, but the stool is
well formed and general health is maintained. The patient may present with a complication. Between relapses, the patient is usually symptomless.

Liaison with the colorectal surgical team at an early
point is encouraged. Specific nutritional, haematinic
and electrolyte deficiencies may require correction.
NSAIDs should be avoided.

Complications

The acute relapse

Local
Toxic megacolon, perforation or rarely massive haemorrhage can occur. There is an increased risk of colonic carcinoma in patients with subtotal or total ulcerative
colitis. The cumulative incidence is 10–15% at 20 years.

Extraintestinal
Extraintestinal complications of inflammatory bowel
disease include the following:
• Skin: erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum,
vasculitis.
• Eyes: uveitis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis.
• Joints: large joint arthropathy, sacroiliitis, ankylosing spondylitis.
• Liver: pericholangitis, sclerosing cholangitis, cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, cholangiocarcinoma.
• Vasculature: arterial and venous thrombosis.
• Renal stones and gallbladder stones: in Crohn’s
disease.

Investigations and diagnosis
Sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy show inflamed mucosa. If the disease is active there may be pus and blood,
visible ulceration and contact bleeding. Other types of
colitis should be excluded, and stool microscopy and
culture is needed to exclude infection. Blood tests
may show anaemia, raised white cell count and a raised
ESR and/or CRP.
Histology shows inflammatory cells infiltrating the
lamina propria with crypt abscesses. There is little involvement of the muscularis mucosa and there is a reduction of goblet cells.
Colonoscopy will show the extent of the disease. Ulcers and pseudopolyps may be seen, oedema of the colonic wall produces widening of the presacral space, and
there may be narrowed areas secondary to carcinoma. In
the patient with acute colitis a plain abdominal X-ray
should be performed to look for colonic dilation and
evidence of mucosal oedema. An erect chest X-ray is often performed in the acute setting to exclude perforation
(60–80% sensitive).

The mortality of patients with acute colitis climbs
sharply if they perforate. Therefore, management is directed at stratifying patients in terms of severity (and
therefore risk of perforation), treating them accordingly
to induce remission and carefully selecting those patients requiring emergency colectomy, hopefully before
they perforate (Fig. 32.3).
The mainstay of therapy in the acute phase is
steroids with bone protection with the addition of a
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).
In mild ulcerative colitis (less than 4 motions/day,
systemically well), oral prednisolone 30–40 mg o.d.
with bone protection is the mainstay of treatment. A
5-ASA (e.g. mesalazine) may help further in achieving
remission. The steroid dose should be decreased by
5 mg per week. In moderate disease (4–6 motions/
day) oral prednisolone (and bone protection) should
be started at 40 mg o.d. and reduced by 5 mg weekly.
A 5-ASA should be considered in addition. If patients
are systemically unwell (tachycardia, hypotension, fever, dehydration, tender colon) and passing more than
8 motions/day, they should be admitted to hospital:
• Nil by mouth, IV fluids, close monitoring of observations, stool chart.
• Daily blood tests and regular plain abdominal X-ray
to monitor progress.
• 400 mg IV hydrocortisone/day in divided doses with
steroid enemas. Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin
is given.
• Antibiotics for any accompanying septicaemia (usually Gram-negative).
• If improved at 5 days, commence oral therapy.
• If failing to respond, some advocate the careful use
of ciclosporin or infliximab to induce remission.

Inflammatory bowel disease
• Indications for emergency colectomy: continuing
deterioration despite medical therapy; toxic dilation
of the colon; perforation.

Maintaining remission
The 5-aminosalicylates help maintain remission, reducing annual relapse rates from 70% to 30%. They are also
available as enemas and suppositories. There are different preparations with different methods of releasing the
active component (5-ASA) in the colon. Sulfasalazine is
an example. This consists of 5-ASA, linked by an azo
bond to sulfapyridine. The 5-ASA is released in the colon by bacterial action. Approximately 20% of patients
cannot tolerate sulfasalazine because of adverse effects,
mostly related to the sulfapyridine. These include headache and fever, blood dyscrasias, bone marrow suppression, rashes and oligospermia, making newer
compounds preferable in young men.
Mesalazine contains 5-ASA alone and may have
fewer side effects. It is a delayed-release preparation.
Azathioprine may be used in patients who relapse repeatedly on steroid withdrawal after an acute episode,
or in whom aminosalicylates are ineffective for maintaining remission; it may take up to 3–4 months to effect a noticeable clinical benefit. Serious adverse effects
include bone marrow suppression and cholestatic jaundice, necessitating blood checks fortnightly for 1
month, then monthly for 2 months, then 2–3 monthly.
Long-term risk appears to be low.

Surgery
Surgery is curative for colonic disease, although not for
extraintestinal complications. Options include panproctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch, permanent
ileostomy or rarely subtotal colectomy with ileorectal
anastomosis. It may be considered electively for chronic
intractable ulcerative colitis, colonic carcinoma, persistent mucosal dysplasia or growth retardation in children. The emergency indications are summarized
above. Advances in laparascopic procedures means
many cases can now be done laparascopically. But the
majority of patients are managed medically.

Monitoring and prognosis
Approximately 70% of untreated patients relapse annually and up to 30% eventually require surgery, although
the overall mortality is close to that of the general population. The main risks to life are severe attacks of ulcerative colitis and colonic cancer. Patients with extensive
ulcerative colitis of 10 years’ duration or more used to
be offered colonoscopy every 1–2 years to prevent colonic cancer by taking multiple biopsies to look for mucosal dysplasia (i.e. detection of cancer at a curable
stage), and by offering elective colectomy if appropriate.

32

British Society of Gastroenterologist’s guidelines now
recommend frequency of colonoscopy should be
guided by the extent and degree of disease activity
instead.

Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the GI tract from
the mouth to the anus. The involvement is not confluent (‘skip lesions’) (Fig. 32.2). It most frequently presents with ileocaecal disease followed by colonic, ileal
alone, diffuse small intestinal, gastric and oesophageal
involvement. The overall prevalence in the Western
world is approximately 1 in 1000 and it is more common in Caucasians than in Afro-Caribbeans.

Clinical presentation
The patient has diarrhoea and abdominal pain. There
may be a fever, anaemia and weight loss. The patient
may be clubbed and there may be associated complications (e.g. joint, skin or eye complications, as with ulcerative colitis).
The presentation depends on the site of disease and
on the tendency to perforate or fistulate rather than to
fibrose and stricture, which is probably determined by
genetic factors. Terminal ileal disease presents with right
iliac fossa pain, often with an associated mass. This may
present acutely, mimicking appendicitis, or chronically,
mimicking irritable bowel syndrome.
Colonic Crohn’s disease is distinguishable from ulcerative colitis by the presence of skip lesions (multiple
lesions with normal bowel in between), rectal sparing,
perianal skin tags or fistulae with or without granulomata on biopsy, although the distinction is unclear in
up to 10% of patients.

Complications
Local
Strictures cause partial or complete GI obstruction.
Entero-enteric, enterovesical, enterovaginal and perianal fistulae may develop. Prolonged disease increases
the risk of small and large bowel cancer. Abscesses
may form. Iron, folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can
all occur.

Extraintestinal
As for ulcerative colitis above. Fig. 32.2 summarizes the
few differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s in
terms of their extraintestinal manifestations.

Investigations and diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by endoscopy and biopsy of lesions.
Histology demonstrates transmural inflammation with
an inflammatory cell infiltrate and non-caseating

255

Gastrointestinal and liver disease
granulomata (in 30%). CT (or MRI) of the small and
large bowel is performed. This shows skip lesions, a
coarse cobblestone appearance of the mucosa and, later,
fibrosis producing narrowing of the intestine with
proximal dilatation. Capsule endoscopy and MRI are
increasingly used to help in diagnosis – MRI is particularly useful for evaluation of fistulae and abscesses
and pelvic disease. Blood tests may show anaemia
(potentially due to terminal ileum involvement and
a resulting inability to absorb vitamin B12). Serum
C-reactive protein can be elevated in cases with active
disease. ESR is a good measure of response to treatment
and a baseline measurement should be available. Stool
samples should be sent for microscopy and culture to
exclude infection.

Management
In most cases of active Crohn’s disease, there are three
therapeutic alternatives: drugs, diet and surgery. These
options should be discussed with the patient.

Medical management
Some patients manage on symptomatic therapy alone
(e.g. loperamide or codeine phosphate) provided there
is no evidence of obstruction. Cholestyramine (ion exchange resin) is useful for diarrhoea due to terminal ileal disease or resection as it prevents conjugated bile
acids from entering the colon. However, it should not
be given at the same time as other medications as it impairs their absorption. Haematinics may require replacement although anaemia often improves as
disease activity falls.
Acute attacks are often treated with corticosteroids
(e.g. prednisolone 30–40 mg o.d.), but these have no effect on reducing the rate of relapse. Their inappropriate
use must be avoided because of their side-effect profile.
Budesonide is a corticosteroid analogue with rapid hepatic conversion, and therefore reduced systemic side effects, and is useful in mild attacks. Azathioprine (or its
active metabolite 6-mercaptopurine) is often started
during the acute attack. It is helpful in maintaining
the steroid-induced remission but takes several weeks
to be effective.
Patients with colonic involvement may benefit from
a 5-ASA compound (see above). Antibiotics also have a
role. Metronidazole is effective in colonic and perianal
disease and in prevention of recurrence following bowel
resection. If used for longer than 3 months, there is a
risk of peripheral neuropathy. Other antibiotics are
also used.
Elemental diets are useful for inducing remission in
small bowel disease but are expensive and unpalatable;
therefore compliance is often poor. Except in children
where elemental diets are frequently used.

256

Some patients can be maintained in remission without drug therapy – the importance to Crohn’s disease
patients of stopping smoking must be emphasized.
However, some patients require immunosuppressive
therapy – azathioprine and other agents are used. NICE
supports the expert use of infliximab and adalimumab
(monoclonal antibodies against tumour necrosis factoralpha) in severe cases resistant to other drugs.

Surgery
A significant proportion of patients will require an
operation at some stage but surgery should be avoided
if possible. It is indicated for:
• Failure of medical therapy with acute or chronic
illness causing ill health.
• Complications: abscess, obstruction, perforation,
toxic dilation, fistulae not responding to conservative treatment with antibiotics.
• Failure to grow (children).
Small bowel strictures can be widened (stricturoplasty),
whereas those elsewhere need resection. Postoperative
fistulae used to be a common complication but are now
rare, partly because of the use of perioperative antibiotics,
particularly metronidazole. After surgical resection, approximately half the patients remain symptom-free for
5 years and half require further surgery within 10 years.

Prognosis
Around 10–20% of patients remain asymptomatic for
20 years after the first or second episode of symptomatic
disease. Around 50% patients need at least one surgical
resection within their lifetime, particularly if small and
large bowel are involved.

COLORECTAL DISEASE

Colorectal neoplasia
Benign disease
Colonic polyps are common and are often found incidentally during investigation of coincidental GI symptoms such as pain, altered bowel habit or bleeding
haemorrhoids. They may be non-neoplastic or neoplastic (commoner) and may be sessile or pedunculated,
vary from a few millimetres to up to 10 cm in diameter
and be solitary or multiple.
Adenomatous polyps (neoplastic) are usually asymptomatic. They may bleed and lead to iron-deficiency
anaemia. Sessile villous adenomas of the rectum may
present with profuse diarrhoea and hypokalaemia. Most

32

Colorectal disease
colonic carcinomas originate from adenomas. Once a
polyp is found, it is therefore removed endoscopically
and, as further polyps may develop, a programme of continuous colonoscopic surveillance every 3–5 years is
recommended by the British Society of Gastroenterology.
Familial adenomatous polyposis is mendelian dominant. Patients have multiple polyps throughout the GI
tract. In high-risk patients, colectomy with ileorectal
anastomosis may be performed, with continued surveillance of the rectal stump.
Peutz–Jeghers syndrome consists of mucocutaneous
pigmentation and hamartomatous polyps (non-neoplastic) anywhere along the GI tract, most commonly in the
small bowel. It has a mendelian dominant inheritance.

Colorectal cancer
Colonic adenocarcinoma is the second commonest tumour in the UK, causing approximately 20 000 deaths
per year, with a lifetime incidence of approximately 1
in 27. It is commoner in the elderly and less common
in Africa and Asia. It may be related to diets low in fibre
and high in animal fat. Predisposing conditions include
colitis in inflammatory bowel disease and familial
adenomatous polyposis. Genetic factors also play a role,
with a two- to threefold increased risk of developing
colon cancer with one first-degree affected family member. At the upper end of this risk spectrum is hereditary
non-polyposis colon cancer. This is a dominantly inherited mutation of a DNA mismatch repair gene. Affected
family members develop right-sided cancers at an early
age and therefore colonoscopic surveillance is commenced from 25 to 35 years.
Ninety per cent of colon cancer occurs in patients
without a strong family history. Over half of these tumours occur in the rectosigmoid area. Two-thirds of tumours occur with ulceration and spread by direct
infiltration, invading the lymph nodes and blood vessels, leading to metastases.

Clinical features
General features of malignancy include weight loss, anorexia and lethargy. Local features depend on the location of the tumour. Left-sided tumours present with
altered bowel habit and abdominal pain. Rectosigmoid
tumours commonly bleed. Right-sided carcinomas can
become large and remain asymptomatic (as the stool
has a liquid consistency here). They may present with
iron-deficiency anaemia alone. The elderly often present with bowel obstruction. Any persistent change in
bowel habit or rectal bleeding must be investigated.
Examination should always include a digital rectal
examination and sigmoidoscopy. The tumour may be
detected as an abdominal mass and hepatomegaly
may be felt with liver metastases.

Investigations and staging
Faecal occult blood (FOB) test
FOB testing is now fully established in the UK for people
aged 60–69. These home tests potentially detect faecal
blood which may be an early sign of colorectal cancer.
If the test is positive a colonoscopy is performed to rule
out carcinoma. Although it has shown to reduce mortality by up to 20%, the high false-positive rate (10%) has
been a problem. One-off flexible sigmoidoscopy screening is soon to be introduced too.

Blood tests
• FBC for microcytic anaemia (blood loss).
• U&Es to detect electrolyte abnormalities with
diarrhoea.
• LFTs may indicate liver metastases.
• Tumour markers (CEA) to monitor response to
treatment.

Imaging and tissue diagnosis
• Colonoscopy and biopsy is essential for tissue diagnosis and tumour grading (in fit patients).
• Flexible sigmoidoscopy and CT scan (or perhaps CT
colonography).
• CT pneumocolon can be used as an alternative to colonoscopy, providing a virtual intraluminal view of
the colon.

Staging
• Contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis
for all colorectal cancers – modified Duke’s classification (Fig. 32.4).
• Additional MRI for patients with rectal cancer to assess surgical margins and lymph nodes.
• Endorectal ultrasound for rectal cancers.

Gastrointestinal and liver disease

Management
NICE recently published guidelines on the management
of colorectal cancer (Nov 2011). All new cases are discussed at a multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting.
Over 90% of primary tumours can be resected surgically. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy may
be used such as adjuvant chemotherapy for Duke’s C colonic cancers and preoperative radiotherapy considered
for operable rectal cancer. The prognosis is summarized
in Fig. 32.4.
HINTS AND TIPS
Adjuvant chemotherapy is given after surgery to
reduce the statistical chance of relapse due to occult
disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given prior
to surgery, often to shrink or downstage the tumour.

Diverticular disease
A diverticulum is an outpouching of the wall of the gut.
Diverticula can occur anywhere in the gut but are most
common in the colon, especially the sigmoid colon. Diverticulosis implies the presence of diverticula, and diverticulitis implies that there is inflammation within a
diverticulum. They are due to high intracolonic pressure
with weakness of the colonic wall. The mucosa therefore
herniates through the muscle layers of the gut. The incidence increases with age and affects up to one-third of
the population, although most people are asymptomatic. It is more common in women than in men.

Clinical features
There may be colicky left-sided abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and flatulence. The pain may be relieved with defecation and there may be a change in
bowel habit with constipation or diarrhoea. With diverticulitis, pain is more severe and the patient is pyrexial.
Diverticula may perforate and lead to localized or generalized peritonitis or fistula formation. Rectal bleeding
may occur and is usually sudden and painless. Subacute
obstruction may occur due to stricture formation. Fistulae may communicate between the colon and bladder
(vesicocolic fistula), leading to pneumaturia and recurrent urinary tract infection. They may also form between
the colon and vagina or small bowel.

Investigations
In the acute setting an FBC, U&Es, LFTs, amylase and an
arterial blood gas are all indicated as these patients tend
to present with an ‘acute abdomen’. If the patient is pyrexial blood cultures should be sent. If there is any rectal

258

bleeding proctoscopy may be indicated. Plain abdominal and chest X-rays should be performed (to rule out
obstruction and/or perforation), but a CT scan is the imaging modality of choice. Colonoscopy is contraindicated in the acute setting as it may cause colonic
perforation; instead this can be performed as an outpatient once the acute episode has resolved.

Management
In acute diverticulitis, treatment is analgesia, adequate
hydration and antibiotics. The patient may have to be
kept nil by mouth and given IV fluids. Abscesses may
need to be drained, and peritonitis following perforation or obstruction may necessitate resection and colostomy. Patients with profuse rectal bleeding may require
transfusion and colonic resection. Treatment of fistulae
is surgical.
For diverticulosis, a high-fibre diet is recommended,
and soluble fibre supplements and bulk-forming agents
can be prescribed. Antispasmodics may provide symptomatic relief when colic is a problem. Drugs that slow
intestinal motility (e.g. codeine and loperamide) could
exacerbate symptoms and are contraindicated.

Clostridium difficile and
pseudomembranous colitis
Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic bacterium that can
cause anything from mild diarrhoea to severe inflammation and potential perforation of the colon (pseudomembranous colitis). Colonization by C. difficile is
encouraged by broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
(e.g. broad-spectrum beta-lactams or third-generation
cephalosporins), which eliminates other normal gut bacteria. This is a important contributing factor to the incidence of C. difficile infection in hospitals. There should
be a suspicion of any in-patient who develops diarrhoea
after a period of antibiotics. It is usually of acute onset
but may run a chronic course. Sixty per cent of those
affected are over 75 years of age. Spread is through the
faecal−oral route and handwashing with water and soap
is of paramount importance to stop the spread of
infection
Clinical features include diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. As with all causes of colitis, if severe, toxic
dilation of the colon can occur. C. difficile infection has
become more common and hospitals are taking measures to reduce antibiotic use and stop cross-infection.
The most frequently implicated antibiotic is clindamycin
but few antibiotics are free of this side effect.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is by demonstration of Clostridium difficile
toxin in faeces using either cell culture assay or

Infective enteritis
immunoassay. Sigmoidoscopy reveals an erythematous,
ulcerated mucosa, which is covered by a membrane.
However, the appearances are not essential for the
diagnosis.

Management
Suspected antibiotics should be stopped and patients
should be isolated for infection control. Oral vancomycin or metronidazole are used as specific treatments. If
the patient is postoperative and has an ileus, IV metronidazole is indicated. Careful attention should be paid
to fluid and electrolyte management.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding
The differential diagnosis of lower GI bleeding is shown
in Fig. 32.5.
Resuscitation should be carried out as for upper GI
bleeds, and further investigations are carried out when
the patient is stable. Examination should include a rectal
examination to exclude carcinoma, sigmoidoscopy and
colonoscopy. Barium enema may add to information
and CT and angiography can be carried out if vascular abnormalities are suspected. Stool samples must also be
sent to microbiology to exclude an infectious cause.
Lower GI bleeding may be occult and chronic, presenting with iron-deficiency anaemia and general lethargy and fatigue. If the history does not suggest a
particular site in the GI tract responsible for the blood
loss, a sensible working plan is upper GI endoscopy followed by colonoscopy. CT and/or MRI  capsule endoscopy are now the preferred means of investigating small
intestinal pathology. Isotope-labelled red blood cell
studies may localize the site of bleeding, but this is rarely
done. Note that both angiography and isotope-labelled
red blood cell studies require active bleeding in order to
provide useful information (see Ch. 10).

Ischaemic colitis
Acute ischaemia of the bowel may occur and is often
embolic (e.g. due to atrial fibrillation). This is a surgical
emergency. It is suggested by severe abdominal pain,
haemodynamic shock and a relative absence of clinical
signs with a metabolic acidosis.
Chronic intestinal ischaemia usually relates to low
flow in the inferior mesenteric artery and therefore affects the descending colon. Severe postprandial pain occurs (‘gut claudication’) with rectal bleeding and
diarrhoea. There is often a pyrexia, tachycardia and leucocytosis. It usually settles with conservative management. Diagnosis is difficult but revascularization may
be attempted following angiography. Occasionally gangrene of the affected gut segment occurs – surgical resection is necessary and mortality is high.

Microscopic colitis
This diagnosis is defined by the triad of chronic watery
diarrhoea, normal colonoscopy and histopathological
evidence of increased inflammatory cells within colonic
biopsies. The condition is associated with other autoimmune conditions such as Sjögren’s syndrome and coeliac
disease and commonly affects middle-aged females.
Treatment is symptomatic is with budesonide.

INFECTIVE ENTERITIS
Infective enteritis is an infectious illness predominantly
affecting the small intestine. It can be caused by bacteria,
viruses or toxins such as heavy metals or mushrooms.

Aetiology
Bacterial enteritis is frequently a result of infection of
water or food sources.

Bacterial gastroenteritis
Bacteria can affect the GI tract by means of direct invasion
of the mucosal barrier, releasing toxins or through adherence and disruption of the enterocyte brush border. It is
often the case in bacterial infections, fever is a common
feature in bacterial gastroenteritis. The time from infection to symptoms is variable depending on the pathological mechanism. For example, S. aureus gastroenteritis
may be toxin mediated (preformed) and symptoms will
occur within 1–6 h of ingestion. In contrast, Shigella infection has an incubation time from 1 to 7 days as its
pathogenesis is mediated through direct destruction
of the intestinal mucosal epithelium causing dysentery.
Bacterial causes of bloody diarrhoea include Campylobacter, Shigella, C. difficile and Salmonella infection.

259

Gastrointestinal and liver disease

Viral gastroenteritis
More than half of cases of gastroenteritis are viral, particularly in children. Rotaviruses are the most common. Another, very relevant, cause for healthcare professionals is
gastroenteritis due to norovirus. This virus causes profound diarrhoea and vomiting. Usually symptoms last
only 24-48 h, but its highly infective nature means it is
a frequent cause of ward closure in hospital (the ‘winter
vomiting bug’). Good hand hygiene is vital in preventing
spread. Management is entirely symptomatic.

Clinical features
Symptoms are usually of acute onset. Diarrhoea and/or
vomiting are a prominent feature. Diarrhoea is often
watery, but may also be bloody. Associated symptoms
may include fever and abdominal cramping. Very rarely
seizures may be a feature. If symptoms persist and the
patient is unable to effectively rehydrate, hypovolaemia
and its consequences may ensue.

Investigations
Stool culture and microscopy may reveal the causative
organism. If IV fluids are considered U&Es should be
measured prior to starting these. Blood cultures are indicated if the patient is pyrexial.
If there is bloody diarrhoea then blood cultures,
U&Es and FBC should be performed. If the haemoglobin is low then haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)
should be considered and a blood film should be
requested to look for fragmented red blood cells

Management
Management is usually symptomatic and the infection
self-limiting. Oral fluid intake, with rehydration solution containing salt and sugar, should be encouraged
to minimalize losses. Occasionally IV fluids and antiemetics may be required if symptoms are severe and persistent. Antidiarrhoeals or not normally encouraged as it
stops eradication of the causative agent. Antibiotics are
only indicated in a few situations (Salmonella, Cholera,
Shigella and Campylobacter). Food poisoning is a notifiable disease in the UK.

disorder in terms of gastrointestinal anatomy and predominant symptoms. Most frequently there is intermittent colicky abdominal pain, which is relieved by bowel
action, diarrhoea or frequent passage of small amounts
of stool, and bloating. The diarrhoea may alternate with
periods of constipation. Some people have a sense of
incomplete evacuation or ‘rectal dissatisfaction’. Symptoms may be precipitated by certain foods, drugs (e.g.
antibiotics) or stress. Other features such as tiredness,
nausea, backache and bladder symptoms are common
in people with IBS, and may be used to support the
diagnosis. Note that rectal bleeding is not a feature
and that prominent nocturnal symptoms point away
from the diagnosis.

Investigations
The term ‘diagnosis of exclusion’ is not encouraged now
as it belittles symptoms. However, it is important not to
miss more serious disease, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. It is prudent to check the FBC and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, and perform a sigmoidoscopy. Faecal calprotectin, a biochemical test
commonly positive in inflammatory bowel disease,
has a valuable role in helping exclude this diagnosis.
Older patients, or patients in whom colonic carcinoma
is suspected, warrant a CT or colonoscopy.

Management
NICE published guidelines on the management of IBS
in adults (Feb 2008). Symptoms may improve with a
high-fibre diet, or with other agents that increase stool
bulk. Specific aggravating foods should be avoided. In
some patients there may be important psychological aggravating factors that respond to reassurance. Antimotility drugs such as loperamide may relieve diarrhoea, and
antispasmodic drugs (e.g. mebeverine 135 mg t.d.s.)
may relieve pain. Opioids with a central action such
as codeine are best avoided because of the risk of dependence. Some patients derive benefit from low doses of
tricyclic antidepressant drugs or a FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols) diet in
collaboration with a dietician.

Non-ulcer dyspepsia
IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME
AND NON-ULCER DYSPEPSIA

Irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the commonest diagnosis made in GI clinics. It is a symptom-based diagnosis and the ROME III criteria are used to classify the

260

This term encompasses a heterogeneous group of patients with dyspeptic symptoms (see Ch. 9) and no macroscopic mucosal abnormality. Only a minority of them
actually undergo endoscopy (see Fig. 9.3).
The cause of their symptoms is unclear but is likely to
be multifactorial and include acid, dysmotility, H. pylori
infection and depression. Management is often unsatisfactory. Lifestyle advice is given regarding smoking,
alcohol, obesity, etc. Culprit drugs, such as NSAIDs,

Diseases of the gallbladder
should be withdrawn if possible. Antisecretory therapy
is used and is titrated to the lowest-cost preparation that
achieves symptom control. Those who are H. pyloripositive should receive eradication and patient reassurance is an important part of their management.
HINTS AND TIPS
In irritable bowel syndrome it is important to gain the
patient’s confidence. Investigations should be
sufficient to exclude other important diagnoses. The
diagnosis should then be made with appropriate
explanation and advice, otherwise patients may move
from doctor to doctor seeking further investigation.

32

• Ultrasound examination may demonstrate stones in
the gallbladder or bile ducts.
• In the presence of duct dilation or stones, endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is
usually performed. This is therapeutic, allowing
sphincterotomy and the removal of stones.
• Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
(MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound help to image
the biliary tree but have no therapeutic use. Hepatic
iminodiacetic acid scintigraphy can demonstrate a
blocked cystic duct, but is rarely used.
• Haemolysis screen: if pigment stones are suspected
or found operatively.

HINTS AND TIPS

DISEASES OF THE GALLBLADDER

Gallstones
The incidence of gallstones rises with age, body mass
index and parity, and gallstones are more common in
females. Gallstone-related pathology is responsible for
a significant proportion of hospital admissions with
abdominal pain.
Bile contains cholesterol, bile pigments and phospholipids, and it is the relative concentrations of these that
determine the kind of stone that is formed. Pigment
stones are small and radiolucent, and they are occasionally associated with haemolytic anaemia due to increased
formation of bile pigment from haemoglobin.
Cholesterol stones are large, often solitary, and are radiolucent. Mixed stones contain calcium salts, pigment
and cholesterol; 10% are radio-opaque. (Compare with
renal stones, of which approximately 90% are radioopaque.)
Gallstones are often asymptomatic but may cause
acute or chronic cholecystitis (see below), biliary colic
(stone impacted in neck of gallbladder or cystic duct)
or obstructive jaundice. Other presentations include
cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts causing right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and fever with rigors –
Charcot’s triad), pancreatitis, empyema and gallstone ileus, where the gallstone perforates the gallbladder, ulcerates into the duodenum, and passes on to obstruct the
terminal ileum. The long-term presence of gallstones
may be associated with gallbladder carcinoma as a consequence of chronic inflammation.

Investigations
• Liver function tests may show a cholestatic picture
(see Ch. 13).
• Prothrombin time prolongation may occur over a
longer period because of vitamin K (fat-soluble)
malabsorption.

Courvoisier’s law: ‘If the gallbladder is palpable in
painless jaundice, the cause unlikely to be gallstones’
(because gallstones cause fibrosis and shrinkage of the
gallbladder).

Management
Stones in the gallbladder itself can cause various syndromes (see above). If the patient is symptomatic of
gallstones (and this is not always easy to ascertain –
see ‘Chronic cholecystitis’ below), treatment is by cholecystectomy, which may be performed acutely or after
a delay (see ‘Acute cholecystitis’ below).
Stones in the biliary tree can cause obstructive jaundice, cholangitis and pancreatitis. These patients require
resuscitation and IV antibiotics for infection – notably
in cholangitis. Sphincterotomy via ERCP may release
stones in the common bile duct preoperatively if these
are present. Other options include exploration of the
ducts at open operation or laparoscopic exploration
in the case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy if there is
a reason to suspect stones in the duct.

Acute cholecystitis
This disease is most common in overweight, middleaged women but may occur at any age. It usually follows
the impaction of a stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann’s pouch, which causes right upper quadrant or
epigastric pain. It is distinguishable from biliary colic
by the presence of inflammation leading to fever, rigors,
vomiting, local peritonism or a gallbladder mass. If the
stone moves to the common bile duct, jaundice may occur. Murphy’s sign may be positive; this is pain on inspiration when two fingers are placed over the right upper
quadrant, due to an inflamed gallbladder impinging on
the examiner’s fingers.

Differential diagnosis

Biliary tract cancer

The differential diagnosis of acute cholecystitis includes
the following:

Cholangiocarcinoma

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

This is a cancer that arises from the bile duct epithelium,
commonly extrahepatic. Patients usually present with
obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. The cancer is usually
primary, but can be associated with sclerosing cholangitis, chronic inflammation and chronic cholecystolithiasis. Surgery is the only curative option, but prognosis is
poor (15% at 5 years). ERCP and stenting is used for
palliation.

Appendicitis in a highly situated appendix.
Right basal pneumonia.
Perforated peptic ulcer.
Pancreatitis.
Myocardial infarction.
Biliary colic.
Cholangitis.

Investigations

Gallbladder cancer

The white cell count is elevated and inflammatory
markers raised (unlike in biliary colic). A chest X-ray
(CXR), ECG, serum amylase and cardiac enzymes
should be taken to help exclude differential diagnoses.
Ultrasound will commonly show a thickened gallbladder wall and stones with or without common bile duct
dilatation.

Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder is rare and risk increases with age. The tumour typically arises in the fundus. They are usually associated with gallstones and
often discovered incidentally (during cholecystectomy).
Curative treatment requires radical cholecystectomy,
which includes resecting segment IV of the liver. Prognosis is very poor, unless the cancer is identified incidentally before metastatic spread.

Management

Cancer of the ampulla

Management is usually initially conservative, unless
complications ensue (e.g. perforation of the gallbladder). The patient should be on bed rest, nil by mouth
with IV fluids, and analgesia and antibiotics (e.g. Tazocin and metronidazole) should be given. Either cholecystectomy is performed after 48 h (a ‘hot lap chole’)
or the inflammation is allowed to settle and the gallbladder is removed after 2–3 months.

This rare condition affects the ampulla of Vater. The tumour arises in the last 1 cm of the common bile duct.
Patients present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, pruritus, or weight loss. Because of the location of
this cancer, patients present relatively early (compared
to pancreatic cancer for example). A Whipple’s procedure, with curative intend, is often the preferred option.
Prognosis is relatively good for those that undergo surgery; 60–80% at 5 years.

HINTS AND TIPS
Acute ascending cholangitis is infection of the biliary
tree. The causative organisms are commonly Gramnegative and can lead to overwhelming sepsis if not
treated promptly.

Chronic cholecystitis
Recurrent episodes of cholecystitis are usually associated with gallstones, leading to intermittent colic and
chronic inflammation. There is abdominal discomfort,
bloating, nausea, flatulence and intolerance of fats.
The differential diagnosis includes myocardial ischaemia, hiatus hernia and oesophagitis, peptic ulcer
disease, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic relapsing
pancreatitis and tumours of the GI tract. It can be very
difficult to be sure that the symptoms relate to the gallbladder and stones and therefore the decision to perform a cholecystectomy should be made cautiously.

262

DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS

Carcinoma of the pancreas
The incidence of pancreatic carcinoma is increasing.
Risk factors include age, smoking, chronic pancreatitis
and familial cancer syndromes (e.g. BRCA2 mutations).
Approximately three-quarters of tumours occur in the
head, the rest occurring in the body or tail. Secondary
diabetes is uncommon. Pancreatitis may occur due to
obstruction of the pancreatic duct.

Clinical features
General features of malignancy include anorexia, weight
loss and lethargy. Local features are dyspepsia or epigastric pain radiating to the back and obstructive jaundice
with an enlarged gallbladder. There may be hepatomegaly from biliary obstruction or metastases.

Diseases of the pancreas
Thrombophlebitis migrans is a paraneoplastic feature in
10% of patients. Fever may occur. In any patient that
presents with painless jaundice the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer must be excluded.

Investigations
Blood tests for anaemia (FBC) and liver metastases or
biliary obstruction (LFTs) should be performed and, if
a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is suspected, the tumour
marker Ca19-9 should also be measured. Ultrasound
may identify a mass and dilated bile ducts. CT scan
may define resectability of the tumour and help to stage
it. ERCP may confirm the diagnosis, and allow for biopsies to be taken. MRCP and endoscopic ultrasound can
provide valuable information, in particular regarding
local bile duct involvement. Occasionally, laparoscopy
is used to further stage the disease.

Management
A minority of patients may be suitable for operative
treatment commonly because pancreatic cancer presents late and the tumour has invaded vital structures
(e.g. portal vessels). Patients with ampullary carcinoma
often present early with jaundice, and surgical removal
may therefore be more successful. If surgery is possible a
Whipple’s procedure is usually performed. There is no
role for (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who
are deemed suitable for surgery still have a poor prognosis of 10% at 5 years (commonly due to local
recurrence).
Without treatment, survival is usually only a few
weeks to months after diagnosis. Palliative procedures
may include bypass surgery for obstructions (e.g. gastrojejunostomy to bypass duodenal obstruction) or stent
insertion to relieve obstructive jaundice (either percutaneously or by ERCP).

Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory condition of
the pancreas causing local and systemic reactions. The
incidence is approximately 3 cases per 10 000 population in the UK. Although commonly managed conservatively, general surgeons also manage this condition.
HINTS AND TIPS
The causes of pancreatitis can be recalled from the
mnemonic GET SMASHED: Gallstones, Ethanol,
Trauma, Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune diseases,
Scorpion stings, Hypertriglyceridaemia, ERCP and
Drugs, e.g. azathioprine or diuretics.

32

Aetiology
Over 80% of cases are secondary to either gallstones or
alcohol. Other causes include ERCP, surgery or trauma,
toxins and drugs, hyperglyceridaemia, scorpion venom
and autoimmune. A careful alcohol history must be
taken and evidence of gallstone disease should be sought.

Clinical features
The clinical features of pancreatitis should be thought of
in terms of local, pancreatic, effects and systemic effects.
Locally, pancreatitis causes pain. The pain is often progressive, severe, epigastric, radiating through to the back.
Nausea and vomiting are common. In terms of systemic
symptoms the patient may be short of breath due to
adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), tachycardic
as part of the systemic inflammatory response (SIRS).
On examination, there is abdominal tenderness with
guarding and rebound tenderness. There may be a
tachycardia, fever, jaundice, hypotension and sweating.
There may be bruising around the umbilicus (Cullen’s
sign) or in the flanks (Grey Turner’s sign).

Differential diagnosis
This includes any cause of an acute abdomen (e.g. cholecystitis, mesenteric ischaemia, intestinal perforation,
etc.). Myocardial infarction and dissecting aortic aneurysm should also be excluded.

Investigations and prognostic scoring
The following investigations are required in anyone presenting with acute pancreatitis. The reasons are twofold:
(1) they make the diagnosis and rule out alternative
causes of the acute abdomen, and (2) they help in prognosis as they are required for prognostic scoring systems.

Blood tests
• Serum amylase: often markedly raised (over
1000 IU/mL). Beware though, a negative amylase
test does not exclude pancreatitis (this is especially
true in acute attacks on a background of previous
episodes) Amylase is also raised with cholecystitis,
perforated viscus (e.g. a duodenal ulcer) and even
in ectopic pregnancy, but usually to a lesser extent.
Serum lipase is a more sensitive and specific, but
not always available
• Serum calcium: may be low.
• FBC: white cell count usually raised.
• U&Es: raised urea is an indicator of severity.
• LFTs: if aetiology gallstone will show obstructive
picture.
• Fasting serum glucose: often raised in pancreatitis.
• Arterial blood gases: metabolic acidosis. It also measures po2, important in prognosis.

263

Gastrointestinal and liver disease
Imaging
• Abdominal X-ray: gallstones, pancreatic calcification
indicating previous inflammation, an absent psoas
shadow due to retroperitoneal fluid, and a distended
loop of jejunum (‘sentinel loop’).
• Erect CXR: widened mediastinum in aortic dissection; gas under the diaphragm in perforated peptic
ulcer.
• Abdominal ultrasound: should be performed in all
patients within first 48 h of admission. It allows visualization of gallstones and duct dilatation.
• Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan: within 48 h
for severe pancreatitis, within 7 days for those failing
to improve (suspected pancreatic necrosis), delayed
for detection of pseudocyst.

Other tests
• ECG: to exclude myocardial infarction.
Prognosistic scoring systems have been validated to determine severity, guide management and predict mortality. Multiple scoring systems are used, but the
modified Glasgow (Imrie) severity score is most commonly used (Fig. 32.6). An alternative prognostic scoring system is APACHE-II, which also considers chronic
health problems. Any patient with severe pancreatitis
should be discussed with ICU/HDU as multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome (MODS) can quickly evolve.
Mortality is 5–10% but recurrence is uncommon in
patients who recover. Death may be from shock, renal
failure, sepsis or respiratory failure. Other complications include hypocalcaemia due to the formation of

pancreatitis.

Management
Management is usually conservative. IV fluids should be
given to maintain the circulating volume and hourly
urine output should be measured (preferably by means
of a urinary catheter). In severe pancreatitis a central venous catheter may be helpful for assessing the volume
of fluid required. Supplementary oxygen should be
given, aiming for saturations between 94 and 98%. Nutritional support is key and early enteral feeding is now
recommended
Pain relief is with IV opiates. If the patient has persistent vomiting a nasogastric tube should be inserted.
Blood tests, especially U&Es, glucose and calcium,
should be monitored daily.
Surgery should be considered for suspected haemorrhagic necrosis of the pancreas. Some give H2-receptor
antagonists, prophylactic antibiotics or peritoneal lavage, although these measures are of unproven value.

Chronic pancreatitis
The main cause of chronic pancreatitis is chronic excessive alcohol intake. Other causes include cystic fibrosis
and haemochromatosis. The patient is generally ill with
weight loss and has recurrent abdominal pain radiating
to the back. Steatorrhoea is secondary to malabsorption
from pancreatic insufficiency. Diabetes may occur due
to involvement of pancreatic islet beta cells, and there
may be intermittent or persistent obstructive jaundice.

calcium soaps, transient hyperglycaemia, pancreatic abscess requiring drainage and pseudocyst (i.e. fluid in the
lesser sac presenting as a palpable mass), persistently
raised serum amylase or liver function tests, and fever.
Patients should be investigated to exclude gallstones,
and alcohol should be avoided.

These are similar to those for acute pancreatitis, although serum amylase is not helpful in the diagnosis
as it is usually only slightly raised. In addition the following investigations should be performed:
• Plasma glucose: raised in diabetes.
• CT scan: may show dilated ducts.
• ERCP: outlines the anatomy of the ducts and shows
calculi.
Investigations of consequences or complications of
pancreatitis should also be carried out (e.g. tests of malabsorption, jaundice and pancreatic exocrine function).

Management
Alcohol should be avoided, and the patient should be
advised to follow a low-fat diet because of malabsorption. Fat-soluble vitamins, calcium and pancreatic

Diseases of the liver
enzymes are given. Insulin is required if the patient develops diabetes, and gallstones should be removed.
For recurrent attacks causing unremitting pain, pancreatectomy should be considered, although this procedure has a high mortality. Patients often have chronic
persistent pain and can become addicted to opiates
and there is an increased rate of suicide.

DISEASES OF THE LIVER

Acute hepatitis

Chronic liver disease

Acute hepatitis is inflammation of a previously healthy
liver lasting less than 6 months. It has multiple aetiologies (Fig. 32.7). Treatment and prognosis is dependent
on the underlying cause (see below). However, certain
co-morbidities will affect overall recovery and disease
progression. These include chronic infection with, for
example, HIV or hepatitis C virus, chronic alcohol
abuse, necessary drug therapy (e.g. methyldopa) or genetic disorders (e.g. haemachromatosis). Fulminant hepatic failure is a syndrome that is due to overwhelming
hepatocyte necrosis, leading to severe impairment of
liver function.

Chronic liver disease can be a result of many underlying
pathologies; a number of which are discussed in this
chapter. Clinical features include leuconychia, clubbing, Dupuytren’s contracture, bruising, gynaecomastia, spider naevae and caput medusa. Liver size is not
a reliable sign as end-stage cirrhotic livers are commonly
not palpable. Progression is often over years, but patients may present acutely with decompensated liver
failure. Symptoms of this are variceal bleeding, ascites,
encephalopathy, coagulopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The principal problems in severe chronic liver
disease are the degree of hepatocellular failure and the
complications of portal hypertension. Hepatocellular
dysfunction causes hypoglycaemia, failure of synthesis
of clotting factors and hypoalbuminaemia.

Established chronic liver disease
Chronic liver disease is the result of cycles of destruction
and regeneration of liver parenchyma resulting in scarring by means of fibrosis eventually causing cirrhosis.
The results of this are portal hypertension, biosynthesis
impairment (e.g. clotting factors, albumin), potentially
hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. Often
patients may have no or few symptoms, but the degree
of hepatocyte destruction reduces hepatic reserve and
minimal events may precipitate hepatic decompensation (Fig. 32.8), the features of which are discussed
below.

portal–systemic shunt between the left gastric vein (portal) and lower oesophageal veins (systemic). The increased pressure in these varices makes them prone to
rupture and consequently bleeding. The management
of variceal bleeding was discussed previously in this
chapter.

Ascites
Ascites is the presence of free fluid within the peritoneal
cavity. Factors leading to the formation of ascites include salt and water retention as a result of cirrhosis,
hypoalbuminaemia resulting in decreased plasma colloid pressure, portal hypertension and increased hepatic
lymph production.
Clinically, there may be abdominal distension, shifting dullness and a fluid thrill, if the ascites is tense. Associated features include hernias, divarication of the
recti, abdominal wall venous distension, ankle oedema
and distension of the neck veins.
Investigations include diagnostic paracentesis. The
ascites is clear and yellow unless it is infected, when it
appears turbid. If the tap is non-traumatic, blood

265

Gastrointestinal and liver disease
signifies intra-abdominal malignancy. The protein content is usually less than 15 g/L. Higher values indicate
infection, hepatic venous obstruction, or malignancy.
Fluid should be sent for cytology to look for malignant
cells and for culture.
The patient should be on bed rest with restricted salt
and fluids. The first choice of diuretic is spironolactone
100–200 mg/day. This can cause painful gynaecomastia
in men, and amiloride can be substituted. If there is a
poor response to spironolactone, furosemide is added.
Fluid balance, weight and U&Es should be monitored
daily. Ascites can also be treated with therapeutic paracentesis and albumin infusion.
Overdiuresis may result in dehydration, uraemia and
hyponatraemia, and may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, oliguria and hepatorenal syndrome.

Encephalopathy
Encephalopathy can either be reversible and episodic or
lead to coma and death (Fig. 32.9). Liver failure results
in diminished hepatic metabolism of substances derived from the gut, which can cause neurotoxicity.
Clinical features include impaired conscious level, personality disturbances, inversion of the normal sleep pattern, slurred speech, constructional apraxia, flapping
tremor (asterixis), hepatic fetor, brisk tendon reflexes,
increased muscle tone and rigidity, and hyperventilation in deep coma.
Initial treatment aims to correct or remove the precipitating causes. These may include electrolyte abnormalities, sepsis, hypovolaemia, hypoxia, bleeding and
constipation. Diuretics, sedatives and opiates should
be stopped, and intracranial pathology should be excluded, especially in alcoholic patients. CT scanning
of the brain may be appropriate to exclude subdural
haematomas.
Measures should then be instituted to remove nitrogenous material and bacteria from the bowel. Oral laxatives and rifaximin, a new antibiotic, are used. The
patient is put on a high-calorie diet. In alcoholics, IV
thiamine is given to treat possible Wernicke’s
encephalopathy.

encephalopathy.

266

Once over the acute phase, routine measures include
lactulose to ensure two soft bowel motions/day. The
patient is educated to avoid precipitating causes, including alcohol. Recurrent acute-on-chronic encephalopathy is an indication for liver transplantation.

Hepatorenal syndrome
Hepatorenal syndrome is discussed in Ch. 33.

Acute viral hepatitis
Hepatitis A
Epidemiology
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a member of the picornavirus
family. Transmission is by the faecal–oral route. The incubation period varies from 2 to 6 weeks. Fever, fatigue,
abnormal liver function and jaundice occur in adults.
Clinical disease is uncommon in infants and young
children, and the infection may go unnoticed. It may
be acquired by eating partially cooked shellfish from estuaries contaminated by sewage.

Serology
At the onset of symptoms, immunoglobulin (Ig)M antiHAV antibody is present in serum. High titres persist for
3–12 months, so a positive test in a patient with acute
hepatitis indicates recent acute infection. Previous infection, and therefore immunity, can be diagnosed by the
presence of IgG anti-HAV without IgM anti-HAV. IgG is
detectable for life.

Prognosis
The disease is usually self-limiting and treatment is
symptomatic. Relapses and cholestatic jaundice may occur but hepatitis A does not progress to chronic hepatitis.

Prevention and control
Prophylaxis can be obtained by immune serum immunoglobulin or active immunization. The latter induces
higher levels of anti-HAV.

Hepatitis B
Epidemiology
Hepatitis B (HBV) is a DNA virus. The complete infectious virion (Dane particle) consists of the following:
• Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): the outer lipoprotein ‘surface’ envelope.
• Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg): the internal core,
which surrounds the viral genome of DNA.
• Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg): a subunit of HBcAg; it
can be detected in serum and is a useful marker of
circulating virions and infectivity.

Diseases of the liver
Transmission is parenteral through cutaneous and mucosal routes, across breaks in the skin or mucous membranes, and the mean incubation period is 75 days. In
developed countries hepatitis B occurs sporadically.
Those at risk are IV drug users, healthcare workers,
haemophiliacs or those on haemodialysis, babies of
HBsAg-positive mothers, adopted children from endemic areas, sexual promiscuity, individuals in residence in institutions. Infection is characteristically
anicteric, asymptomatic and chronic.

Serology
Following exposure to HBV, HBsAg can be detected
throughout the prodromal phase and is not usually
cleared from the serum until convalescence. Other early
markers include anti-HBc and HBeAg. A positive IgM
anti-HBc test typically distinguishes acute from chronic
hepatitis B. The presence of HBeAg implies high infectivity but it is often no longer detectable by the time
the patient consults the doctor.
The loss of HBeAg is a good prognostic sign, indicating that the patient will clear HBsAg and is unlikely to
develop chronic infection. The disappearance of HBeAg
is usually followed by the appearance of serum antiHBe. Anti-HBs is the last marker to appear in serum.

Prognosis
Acute infection rarely leads to fulminant hepatic failure.
Treatment is normally supportive and patients are advised to avoid alcohol. The disease may progress to
chronic hepatitis, particularly in males and older people, which NICE recommends should be treated with
antiviral treatment (e.g. entecavir, adefovir dipivoxil
or alpha-interferon). Progression to chronic hepatitis
occurs in less than 5–10% of people with clinically apparent hepatitis B. Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are complications of chronic hepatitis.

Prevention and control
Infection can be prevented by active immunization.

Hepatitis C

32

Serology
Anti-HCV develops 1–3 months after the onset of clinical illness and, in some patients, will not be detected for
up to 1 year afterwards. Identification of the viral RNA
in serum is possible using the polymerase chain reaction. HCV antigens cannot be detected in serum.

Prognosis
The acute disease is often asymptomatic and leads to
chronic infection in over 50% of patients. In about
20% of patients, cirrhosis may develop insidiously
within 10 years, and patients may develop a clinical
picture resembling autoimmune hepatitis. Systemic
manifestations include cryoglobulinaemia, porphyria
cutanea tarda and membranous glomerulonephritis.
Hepatocellular carcinoma is recognized with chronic
infection. Untreated HIV infection accelerates the
progression of HCV-induced cirrhosis. This particular
cohort may benefit from treatment using ribavirin with
peginterferon-alpha, although NICE also recommends
it for moderate and severe chronic HCV if PCR positive.

Prevention and control
Unlike HAV and HBV there is no effective vaccination.
Prevention of transmission is therefore the mainstay of
infection control. Blood bank screening for anti-HCV
and genetically engineered factor VIII preparations for
haemophiliacs limit the occurrence of hepatitis C.

Hepatitis D
Hepatitis D (delta) virus (HDV) is an RNA virus. The virion particle is encapsulated by the coat protein of HBV
(i.e. HBsAg). Thus infection by HDV only occurs in patients affected by hepatitis B. Transmission is similar to
HBV and the incubation period is 35 days. In developed
countries, infection occurs mainly in drug addicts, haemophiliacs and institutionalized persons. Diagnosis is
through IgM anti-HD, IgG anti-HD, and HDAg detection. The disease is not usually progressive but outbreaks of fulminant hepatitis caused by HBV plus
HDV are described. Chronic infection can occur. The
prevention of HBV infection will also prevent HDV infection as HDV cannot replicate in the absence of
HBsAg.

Epidemiology

Hepatitis E

Hepatitis C (HCV) is an RNA virus, and can be divided
into many major types and subtypes. It is a slowly progressive liver disease with a varied clinical picture, ranging from asymptomatic to rapidly progressing cirrhosis
with hepatocellular carcinoma. Transmission is through
blood, and sexual contact. The mean incubation period
is 9 weeks. There is a high prevalence in haemophiliacs,
thalassaemics, haemodialysed patients, transplant recipients and IV drug abusers.

This RNA virus is transmitted via the faecal–oral route
with a peak of epidemic infection 6–7 weeks after primary exposure and low secondary attack rate. Serum
IgG and IgM to anti-HEV can be detected by ELISA.
The condition is usually self-limiting and progression
to chronic hepatitis does not occur. There is a high mortality (20%) particularly in pregnancy. Prevention and
disease control is dependent on high standards of public sanitation and sewage elimination.

267

Gastrointestinal and liver disease

Other viruses
Viral hepatitis can be caused by non-hepatic, systemic
viruses. Examples include EBV, CMV, herpes simplex,
Q fever and arbovirus (yellow fever). Clinical features
vary enormously from asymptomatic mild hepatitis to
rapidly progressive fulminant fatal hepatitis. Diagnosis
is through specific viral assays using techniques such as
PCR or ELISA. If virology is negative, alternative causes
such as autoimmune hepatitis or Budd–Chiari syndrome must be considered.

•
•

•
•

onset of hepatitis usually indicates progression of
the disease.
Prothrombin time: may be prolonged if fulminant
hepatic failure occurs.
Serum albumin concentrations: may fall slightly
during the course of hepatitis, and serum globulin
may rise.
Hypoglycaemia: may occur with fulminant hepatic
failure.
Serum alpha-fetoprotein values: increased transiently in patients with acute viral hepatitis.

Clinical features of hepatitis

Management

The clinical features of the various forms of acute viral
hepatitis are similar. In the pre-icteric phase, the main
symptoms include malaise, fatigue, listlessness and lack
of energy. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting occur, which
may be induced by fatty food. There is often a distaste
for cigarettes. There may be right upper quadrant pain,
change in bowel habit, myalgia, fever and headaches.
In 10% of patients, acute hepatitis B may be accompanied by a serum-sickness-like syndrome, which is
characterized by low-grade fever, urticarial rash and
arthralgia.
The prodromal symptoms become less severe as
jaundice appears. The urine darkens and the stools are
pale. During the first week, the jaundice may deepen,
and anorexia and fatigue may worsen in this period.
There may be accompanying weight loss.
During recovery, symptoms gradually resolve although malaise and fatigue may persist and mild relapses
can occur in 1–5% of patients. Exercise tolerance is generally depressed for some weeks; depression may be a
prominent symptom.
Physical signs are usually minimal. Common findings are jaundice, hepatic tenderness, hepatomegaly,
splenomegaly and occasionally lymphadenopathy. Skin
rashes may be noted.
Fulminant hepatitis leads to hepatic encephalopathy
with severe jaundice, ascites and oedema and is usually
accompanied by haemorrhage caused by coagulopathies. The disturbance of consciousness reflects a combination of hepatic coma, hypoglycaemia and cerebral
oedema.

The aetiology of hepatitis ranges from infective (e.g. viral or bacterial), to drug-induced, to autoimmune, to alcohol. Management of the cause may therefore be
different. In terms of the management of hepatitis per
se this depends on the severity. Mild disease can be
managed at home with simple analgesia, alcohol avoidance and good nutrition. Cholestyramine may alleviate
itching. Conversely, severe disease may progress to liver
(and further organ) failure requiring intensive care unit
admission and potentially organ support. Patients
should be barrier nursed until the cause of the hepatitis
is identified. All unnecessary drugs should be stopped.

Investigations
The following investigations are important in the patient with acute viral hepatitis:
• Liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
aspartate aminotransferase: these are markedly elevated. Bilirubin concentration is also increased. During recovery, liver enzymes return to normal. A
persistently raised ALT 6 months after the acute

268

Alcoholic liver disease
Men who drink over 500 g of alcohol per week (50
units) and women who drink over 350 g per week
(35 units) have a significant risk of developing cirrhosis.
However, cirrhosis is not inevitable. Only 10–20% of
chronic alcoholics develop cirrhosis even though they
drink the same amount of alcohol over the same period
as other alcoholics. Risk factors for developing cirrhosis
include genetics, gender (women develop alcoholic
hepatitis and cirrhosis younger, and after less intake,
than men), nutrition (alcohol is better tolerated under
optimal dietary conditions), and a synergistic effect with
hepatotropic viruses.

Pathology
Initially there are fatty changes within the liver. With alcoholic hepatitis, there is liver cell necrosis and an inflammatory reaction. Cells contain alcoholic hyaline
or Mallory’s bodies. Later there is deposition of collagen
around the central veins, which may spread to the portal
tracts.
Cirrhosis may result, which is initially micronodular.
Extensive fibrosis contributes to the development of
portal hypertension. With continued cell necrosis and
regeneration, the cirrhosis may progress to a macronodular pattern.

Diseases of the liver

Clinical features
The patient may initially be asymptomatic. With alcoholic hepatitis, there may be fatigue, anorexia, nausea
and weight loss. There may be signs of chronic liver disease (see Ch. 13). Ascites may develop and complicating
hypoglycaemia can precipitate coma.
Hepatic decompensation leads to encephalopathy
and liver failure and can be precipitated by the factors
listed in Fig. 32.8.
With advanced cirrhosis, there may be signs of malnutrition, ascites, encephalopathy and a tendency to
bleed. Signs include bilateral parotid enlargement, palmar erythema, Dupuytren’s contractures and multiple
spider naevi. Men develop gynaecomastia and testicular
atrophy. Portal hypertension develops, leading to
splenomegaly and distended abdominal wall veins.
There may be signs of alcohol damage in other organs
(e.g. peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, proximal
myopathy or pancreatitis).

Investigations
The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase are sensitive indices of alcohol
ingestion. Important variables for predicting outcome
include the prothrombin time, serum albumin, serum
bilirubin and haemoglobin.
Ultrasound will demonstrate fatty liver, and histology of liver biopsy will show the pathological changes
discussed above.

Management
Patients should abstain from alcohol. General measures
for the management of chronic liver disease should be
instigated. Patients may need nutritional support including vitamins B and C.

Prognosis
Fatty liver alone carries a good prognosis if the patient
abstains from alcohol. If the patient is encephalopathic
and malnourished, the mortality is up to 50%. Ascites,
peripheral oedema, persistent jaundice, uraemia and
the presence of collateral circulation are unfavourable
prognostic signs.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly
common condition as a consequence of the obesity epidemic. The condition is characterized by fatty deposit
in the liver in association with inflammation. The condition is typically asymptomatic, although occasionally
a smooth enlarged liver may be felt in clinical examination. The diagnosis may be suspected because of

32

chronically elevated aminotransferase levels, typically
with an aspartate transaminase:alanine transaminase
ratio <1. Liver ultrasound scan will show diffusely
increased echogenecity. Alkaline phosphatase and
gamma-glutamyl transferase are usually raised. Treatment is predominantly lifestyle-based – increased exercise and weight loss have shown to reverse early disease.
Tight glycaemic control, particularly relevant as diabetic
patients are at increased risk of NASH, has been shown
to be important. Glitazones were shown to be particularly effective. Prognosis is good if lifestyle changes
are made, but NASH can progress to liver cirrhosis.

Haemochromatosis
Haemochromatosis is due to excess iron in the tissues.
The presence of skin discoloration and diabetes mellitus
have led to it being called ‘bronze diabetes’ in the past.
Haemochromatosis may be classified as hereditary
(‘primary’) or secondary. Hereditary haemochromatosis
is autosomal recessive. Secondary haemochromatosis
may result from excessive iron administration (e.g.
blood transfusion or iron tablets).
Affected organs are the liver, endocrine system, heart
and joints. Most patients are asymptomatic or have
non-specific symptoms such as arthralgia and lethargy,
until the effect of iron overload becomes apparent in
the fifth or sixth decade. Joints are involved by
chondrocalcinosis.
In the early stages, pain and swelling of the second
and third metacarpophalangeal joints is characteristic.
There is slate-grey skin, due to melanin, and iron deposition. Symptoms include asthenia, abdominal pain,
impotence, arthralgia and amenorrhoea. Signs include
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice and gynaecomastia. The disease may lead on to cirrhosis.
The prevalence varies from 1 in 200 to 1 in 2000, and
men are five to 10 times more likely to be affected than
women, indicating that environmental and genetic factors modify disease expression. Women are usually affected at a later age, partly because of loss of iron
during pregnancy or menstruation. Alcohol may exacerbate the problem by influencing iron metabolism and
absorption.
Total body iron is increased in haemochromatosis
from 4 g up to as much as 60 g. There is cellular damage
and fibrosis, leading to a rusty colour of the liver, pancreas, spleen and abdominal lymph nodes. The liver is
usually enlarged and may be cirrhotic. Iron is found in
all liver cell types and in cardiac myocytes, the adrenals,
pituitary, pancreas and testes. Chondrocalcinosis in the
joints is associated with synovial haemosiderin and loss
of intra-articular space.
Complications include diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis,
heart disease with arrhythmias, and liver cancer.

269

Gastrointestinal and liver disease

Investigations

Clinical features

• Serum iron is elevated and saturation of plasma
transferrin is high. Serum iron is reduced in inflammatory conditions and is subject to diurnal
variation.
• Serum ferritin is usually high.
• Definitive diagnosis of haemochromatosis depends
on histology of liver biopsies.
• CT scanning and MRI can be used to detect increased
tissue iron but are not routine.
• Genetic testing can be performed to look for the
most common mutations (C282Y and H63D).

The disease is nine times more common in women. It
usually presents in middle age with lethargy and pruritus. Pigmentation and xanthomata may be present,
jaundice may develop and portal hypertension may
lead to ascites or oesophageal varices. There may be stigmata of chronic liver disease. Approximately 80% have
hepatomegaly at presentation, and 50% have splenomegaly. The patient may be asymptomatic at presentation, or present with liver failure.
The average life expectancy is 10 years from diagnosis
but varies considerably. If the serum bilirubin is greater
than 180 mmol/L, the life expectancy is 18 months without transplantation.
Primary biliary cirrhosis is associated with autoimmune conditions (e.g. Sjögren’s syndrome, thyroid disease, Addison’s disease, Raynaud’s syndrome, systemic
sclerosis and coeliac disease). It is also associated with
malabsorption, extrahepatic malignancies, particularly
of the breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Treatment
Patients should be venesected regularly (e.g. 500 mL
weekly), until they develop a mild microcytic anaemia.
Care is needed in patients with severe hepatic disease
because vigorous bleeding may be complicated by
hypoproteinaemia. Folate supplementation may be
needed to optimize erythropoiesis. Seriously ill patients
with overt cardiac haemochromatosis may require highdose parenteral chelation therapy with desferrioxamine
to reverse life-threatening disease.
Patients with established haemochromatosis should
be investigated for cardiac involvement and pituitary as
well as target organ endocrine failure, and replacement
therapy should be instituted when necessary. Patients
should be reviewed to monitor diabetic control, to care
for joint disease and to search for the development of
complications (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma).
Physical examination and screening tests to search for
disordered iron metabolism should be carried out in
family members to identify presymptomatic individuals
so that iron can be removed before cirrhosis and other
complications occur. Genetic studies may be of help.
Life expectancy and hepatic and cardiac function in
primary haemochromatosis are improved by iron depletion. The 5-year survival rate increases from 30%
to 90% by treatment. Removal of iron does not prevent
the development of cancer in patients with established
cirrhosis.
Venesection does not improve endocrine failure or
joint disease.

Primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis is a disease of unknown aetiology primarily affecting the middle-sized intrahepatic
bile ducts as a non-suppurative, destructive cholangitis
leading to bile duct damage, cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and death from liver failure. It is more common in
Europe than in Africa and Asia, with a prevalence of
3–35 per 100 000 and an incidence of 6–15 per million
per year.

270

Investigations
LFTs show an obstructive pattern with elevated serum
alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. As the disease progresses, serum bilirubin rises.
With regard to immunology, HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3
are associated with a threefold increase in the risk of primary biliary cirrhosis. Serum immunoglobulins are
raised, especially immunoglobulin M. Antimitochondrial antibody is positive in approximately 90%.
Ultrasound of the liver is important to exclude obstruction. It can also show evidence of portal hypertension and splenomegaly.
Histology of the liver will confirm the diagnosis. Initially, there is asymmetrical destruction of middle-sized
bile ducts and surrounding lymphocytic infiltrate.
Granulomas may be present. Increasing fibrosis, and
eventually cirrhosis, develops.

Treatment
There is no evidence for immunosuppressive agents.
Bile salts (e.g. ursodeoxycholic acid) may help with cholestasis, and improve biochemical blood results, but
have no proven effect on slowing disease progression.
Liver transplantation is indicated for intractable symptoms or end-stage disease.
Patients with jaundice should receive supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins A, D and K. Diarrhoea is
treated with a low-fat diet and pancreatic supplements.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by
inflammation, scarring and stricturing of the bile ducts,

Diseases of the liver
both intra- and extrahepatic. The cause is unknown, but
the condition is associated with ulcerative colitis, rarely
Crohn’s disease, and HIV infection. Immunologically,
there is an association with HLA-A1, HLA-B8 and
HLA-DR3. Clinical features are due to chronic biliary
obstruction and include jaundice, hepatomegaly, pruritus, fatigue and abdominal pain. Patients are at
increased risk of ascending cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and autoimmune hepatitis.

Investigations
Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin will be elevated.
Test for ANA, SMA and ANCA may be positive. ERCP
shows multiple bile duct strictures with a characteristic
beaded appearance. MRCP is an alternative, noninvasive, modality to show strictures in the biliary tree.
Liver biopsy shows fibrous, obliterative cholangitis.

Management
Ursodeoxycholic acid is used to improve cholestasis.
Endoscopic stent insertion can be used for decompression of prominent strictures in larger ducts. Liver transplantation is indicated for end-stage disease

Autoimmune hepatitis
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is caused by autoantibodies against hepatocytes, causing an inflammatory
condition of the liver. It predominantly affects young
and middle-age women and is associated with thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus, ulcerative colitis and fibrosing
alveolitis amongst others. Clinical features may be insidious and include fever, right upper quadrant pain,
jaundice, epistaxis and gum bleeding, polyarthritis,
urticaria and glomerulonephritis.

Investigations
Liver function tests will usually be abnormal (raised
AST/ALT) and IgG levels will be raised. Autoantibodies
(anti-LKM, ANA and anti-smooth muscle) may be present. Liver biopsy will show mononuclear cell infiltration of portal and periportal regions with piecemeal
necrosis, fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Management
A reducing dose course of oral prednisolone, starting at
30 mg/day, should be commenced and maintained for
2 years. If stopped, relapse is likely. Azathioprine can be
used as an alternative immunosuppressant. If decompensated liver cirrhosis is present then liver transplantation is indicated.

32

Hepatolenticular degeneration
(Wilson’s disease)
This is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism leading to deposition of copper in the following:
•
•
•
•

Liver: cirrhosis with its ensuing complications.
Basal ganglia: tremor and choreoathetosis.
Cerebrum: dementia and fits.
Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (a brown pigmentation
of the periphery of the iris best seen with a slit lamp).
• Renal tubules: renal tubular acidosis.
• Bones: osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.
• Red blood cells: haemolytic anaemia.
Clinical features are usually due to hepatic or central
nervous system involvement.

Investigations
There is a high concentration of copper in the blood,
and low caeruloplasmin, the copper-binding protein.

Management
The dietary intake of copper should be reduced, and
penicillamine is given to aid the elimination of copper
ions. Regular blood counts are mandatory because of
potential agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia with
treatment. Other side effects include oedema, proteinuria, haematuria, rashes, loss of taste and muscle weakness. Relatives should be screened. The prognosis is
generally good.

Hepatic tumours
Benign tumours
Benign tumours of the liver are often an incidental finding on CT or ultrasound scan. Haemangiomas are the
most common. Cysts, adenomas, fibromas, focal nodular hyperplasia and leiomyomas are further types of benign liver tumours. Haemangiomas should not be
biopsied because of bleeding risk. Tumours are managed conservatively unless they become symptomatic.

Malignant tumours
The most common malignant liver tumours are metastases. Primary tumours that tend to metastasize to the
liver are colon, stomach, lung, uterus, breast, pancreas
and carcinoid tumours. Lyphoma and leukaemias
may also spread to the liver. Primary carcinomas of
the liver are less common, although increasing in incidence, and include hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
angiosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma and fibrosarcoma.
HCC is by far the most common primary liver tumour
and is associated with viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, parasite

271

Gastrointestinal and liver disease
infection and anabolic steroid use. Clinical features of
malignant liver cancer, primary or secondary, are weight
loss, anorexia, malaise and right upper quadrant pain.
The pain is capsular in nature and is clinically difficult
to treat. Jaundice is a late feature, if at all, with the
exception of cholangiosarcoma. Investigations include
FBC and blood film, LFTs, hepatitis serology, alphafetoprotein (elevated in 75% of HCC) and CT or MRI
scanning. A liver biopsy is taken to get a tissue diagnosis.
Treatment and prognosis in metastatic liver cancer depends on the cause and the extend of the disease. For
example, in colorectal cancer with liver metastases specialist centres now perform metastectamies with curative intend. Treatment for HCC is surgical resection if
the tumour is solitary and <3 cm or liver transplantation. Percutaneous ablation, chemotherapy and tumour
immobilization increasingly have a role in the management of HCC.

Miscellaneous conditions
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor, synthesized in the liver, important in the correct functioning of the inflammatory cascade. The deficiency of this
protein is a autosomal recessive disorder (chromosome
14) and causes emphysema, cirrhosis and potentially
hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis is made by
measuring protease inhibitor concentrations and can
be screened for prenatally with oligonucleotides. There
is no cure and management is essentially symptomatic.
Liver transplantation is performed for end-stage liver
failure and has the further effect of halting further emphysema formation.

Liver abscess
Liver abscesses are relatively rare in the UK, but common in the developing world. The infectious organism
can be bacterial, parasitic, protozoal or helminthic. Entry to the liver can be direct (penetrating injury),
through the portal circulation, the systemic circulation
or ascending the biliary tree. The clinical feature is predominantly swinging pyrexia with right upper quadrant
pain. There is commonly tender hepatomegaly and if
subacute associated with cachexia. Liver function tests

272

will often show a raised alakaline phosphatase and
gamma-glutamyl transferase. Blood cultures may yield
the causative organism. Ultrasound scan of the liver
will show defined areas of hypoechogenicity. CT is an
alternative/additional imaging modality in liver abscess. Treatment can be conservative with antibiotics
or specific agents against the suspected or proven microorganism. Surgical drainage, under CT or ultrasound
scan guidance, is an alternative option.

Budd–Chiari syndrome
This condition is characterized by hepatic vein obstruction, either through thrombosis or compression, causing hepatomegaly, ascites and abdominal pain. It has
multiple aetiologies, including hypercoagulability
states, myeloproliferative disorders, hepatocellular tumours and radiotherapy, although 30% are deemed
to be idiopathic. The investigations of choice are ultrasound with Doppler or CT scans to show hepatic vein
thrombosis and ascites. Management involves treating
the underlying cause and draining the ascites. Angioplasty or a surgical shunt may be required to bypass
the obstruction. Lifelong anticoagulation is indicated
in the absence of varices. In fulminant liver failure transplantation should be considered.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• Understand how to investigate and manage acute kidney injury.
• Assess and manage patients with acute and chronic kidney disease.
• Understand the relationship between the various clinical presentations of intrinsic renal disease and their
underlying causes.
• Assess and manage patients with urinary tract infections and malignancies.
• Understand the pathophysiology, causes and management of common disorders of fluid and electrolyte
balance.

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has relatively recently replaced
the term ‘acute renal failure’. AKI is a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over a period of hours–days. It is
defined if one of the following criteria is met:
• Serum creatinine rises by 26.4 mmol/L within 48 h.
• Serum creatinine rises 1.5-fold from the reference
value known to have occurred within one week.
• Urine output is <0.5–mL/kg/h for >6 consecutive
hours.
NICE guidelines on the management of AKI are
expected in August 2013.

Aetiology
The conventional classification of AKI is into prerenal,
renal and postrenal causes (Fig. 33.1). Prerenal causes
predominate in hospital and are commonly due to relative hypotension. If poor renal perfusion is allowed to
persist, acute tubular necrosis results. This is the most
common cause of intrinsic renal failure. In ‘real life’,
however, the aetiology of AKI is often multifactorial.
For example, in postsurgical AKI, fluid depletion, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and
nephrotoxic drugs may all play a role.
HINTS AND TIPS
Always remember to establish whether the patient is
taking drugs that interfere with renal perfusion, e.g.
NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
blockers.

Clinical features
The symptoms of AKI are often non-specific and are
commonly detected with routine urea and electrolyte
blood tests. A full history should be taken focusing on
previous renal disease, a background of diabetes, hypertension, analgesic and ACE inhibitor use, urinary symptoms, recent diarrhoea, vomiting or blood loss and
recent operations.
The examination should focus on the cause and consequences of the renal impairment. The most important initial assessment is to gauge the patient’s volume status. Skin
turgor, jugular venous pressure, postural blood pressure,
heart rate, urine output and the presence of peripheral or
pulmonary oedema should be noted. If in hospital, the
patient’s fluid balance chart may be available. There
may be palpable kidneys with polycystic kidney disease
or hydronephrosis. Renal angle tenderness may be present
in renal colic or pyelonephritis (or any other pathology
that stretches the renal capsule). The bladder may be palpable with associated suprapubic discomfort with outflow obstruction. If present, a rectal examination for
prostatic disease and vaginal examination for masses is indicated. Vasculitic changes can be seen in the skin.
Complications of AKI should be elicited as they
may indicate the need for dialysis or haemofiltration.
Uraemia manifests as pericarditis, twitching, hiccups
and uraemic frost. Kussmaul’s deep sighing respiration
may indicate acidosis. Respiratory examination may
show pulmonary oedema.

Investigations
Urine
• Urine should be dipped for blood, protein, nitrites,
leucocytes, glucose and specific gravity.

Genitourinary disease
Fig. 33.1 Causes of acute kidney injury.

Prerenal injury
(ischaemic)

Extracellular volume loss: gastrointestinal loss (e.g. severe diarrhoea or vomiting), urinary loss
(polyuria with salt-losing kidneys), burns
Intravascular volume loss or redistribution: sepsis, haemorrhage (e.g. postpartum or at
operation), hypoalbuminaemia
Decreased cardiac output: heart failure (e.g. post myocardial infarction), cardiac tamponade,
cardiac surgery
Miscellaneous: hepatorenal syndrome

Renal injury

Postischaemic acute tubular necrosis: shock, trauma, sepsis, hypoxia
Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis: antibiotics, analgesics, contrast media, heavy metals,
solvents, proteins
Glomerulonephritis
Acute pyelonephritis
Acute interstitial nephritis: antibiotics, analgesics, leptospirosis, Legionella, viral infections
Vasculitis
Intratubular obstruction: myeloma (Bence Jones protein), urate, rhabdomyolysis
Coagulopathies: acute cortical necrosis, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura, postpartum renal failure
Miscellaneous: malignant hypertension, hypercalcaemia

Postrenal injury

Renal tract obstruction: stones, tumour (prostatic or pelvic), prostatic hypertrophy, surgical
mishap (e.g. accidental ligation of ureters), periureteric fibrosis, bladder dysfunction
Major vessel occlusion: renal artery thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis

• A midstream urine (MSU) sample should be sent for
microscopy, culture and sensitivity. The presence of
red cell casts on microscopy is pathognomonic of
glomerulonephritis.
• Assessment of urinary biochemistry may help in distinguishing prerenal failure from established acute
tubular necrosis. In prerenal failure the kidney avidly
retains salt and water, and hence urinary sodium is
below 20 mmol/L; the urine is concentrated (osmolality over 500 mmol/L) with a urine/plasma osmolality ratio over 1.5:1. Patients with established acute
tubular necrosis cannot concentrate the urine or
conserve sodium. Consequently, urinary sodium is
over 40 mmol/L; the urine is dilute (osmolality below 350 mmol/L) with a urine/plasma osmolality
ratio below 1.1:1. These parameters are much less
reliable in patients on diuretic therapy.
• Test urine for Bence Jones protein or myoglobin
levels if indicated.

Blood tests
• Urea, creatinine and electrolytes should be assessed
(and monitored daily). This will confirm renal impairment and serve as a useful baseline for monitoring the patient’s progress. If the patient is acidotic,
serum bicarbonate will be low. It is crucial to
check the potassium, as hyperkalaemia can be lifethreatening and immediate measures to lower the
potassium need to be taken. The anion gap should
be calculated. The following equation is used:
ð½Naþ  þ ½Kþ Þ  ð½CI  þ ½HCO3  Þ.

274

• Arterial blood gases.
• Full blood count, liver and bone profiles, creatine
kinase, ESR and CRP.
• Blood cultures if infection is suspected.
• Serum autoantibodies (e.g. ANCA), complement,
antistreptolysin O titres, immunoglobulin levels, serum electropheresis can all be tested to aid in identifying the cause.

Other tests
• Electrocardiogram (ECG) can show the precipitating
cause (e.g. myocardial infarction) or complications
such as pericarditis or hyperkalaemia.
• CXR if fluid overload suspected.
• If the patient is truly anuric, especially if signs of sepsis are present or if volume depletion is not likely,
then an urgent ultrasound scan of the renal tract is
indicated. It will show urinary tract obstruction
and kidney size and structure.

Management
AKI is associated with significant mortality – 10% if isolated and 50% if associated with multi-organ distress
syndrome (MODS) (previously multi-organ failure).
As such, diagnosis needs to be prompt, with early senior
or specialist input and instigation of a careful management plan. The management of AKI can grossly be
divided into (1) addressing serious or life-threatening
complications and (2) treating the underlying cause.
Commonly, AKI responds well to careful fluid

Chronic kidney disease
management and blood pressure control, withholding
nephrotoxic drugs, adequate nutrition and treating
the underlying cause (such as relieving obstruction,
treating infection, etc.). If, however, renal function does
not improve, renal replacement therapy may be indicated. In the acute setting this is commonly achieved
by either haemofiltration or haemodialysis. The details
of these techniques are not covered in this book, but
the basic differences are as follows: In haemodialysis
blood flows on one side of a semi-permeable membrane, allowing for diffusion to create an ultrafiltrate
which can be removed. In haemofiltration the blood
is filtered by the process of continuous convection
through a highly permeable synthetic membrane. Haemofiltration is a more time-consuming process and is
more expensive than haemodialyis; it does, however,
not require complex vascular access, and is less likely
to cause haemodynamic compromise.
HINTS AND TIPS
When assessing a patient with AKI ask yourself the
following questions:
• Are there any life-threatening complications?
• Is this renal impairment acute or chronic?
• If acute, is this prerenal, renal or postrenal?
• If intrinsic renal failure, what is the cause?

Life-threatening complications and
emergency dialysis
It is important to look for and treat hyperkalaemia, pulmonary oedema, acidosis and symptomatic uraemia
(pericarditis, encephalopathy). If these complications
do not respond to conservative therapy (see below)
emergency haemodialysis or haemofiltration should
be considered.

33

Treat the underlying cause
The precipitating cause(s) of the renal failure should
be corrected, e.g. relief of obstruction, treatment of
infection. Stop all nephrotoxic drugs and toxins. If the
patient is dehydrated stop all diuretics. Treat any intercurrent infection. It is important to correct and maintain
the intravascular filling of the patient. In some cases this
can be assessed clinically and non-invasively. However,
when uncertain, invasive haemodynamic monitoring
may be helpful. High-dose diuretics may be used to
achieve a urine output if the patient is fluid-overloaded.
This can make it easier to give IV drugs and blood products without causing pulmonary oedema but there is no
evidence that renal recovery is hastened by diuretics. In
patients with severe sepsis or cardiogenic shock, inotropic support may be required.

Supportive management
Patients with AKI require intensive monitoring, particularly of their fluid balance and electrolytes. Particular attention should be paid to oxygenation, nutrition and
glycaemic control.

Prognosis
The prognosis of patients with AKI depends on the
cause, other organ impairment and premorbid state.
Prerenal and postrenal aetiologies usually respond well
to prompt treatment and appropriate support and
regain independent renal function. Intrinsic renal disease is less predictable. Patients with non-oliguric AKI
have a better outcome.
HINTS AND TIPS
Do not give diuretics to patients who are dehydrated –
this will worsen their renal impairment!

Hyperkalaemia
This may be life-threatening and so the reduction of
potassium should be the first priority if it is over
6.5 mmol/L, particularly if ECG changes are present.
The management of hyperkalaemia is discussed in
detail later in this chapter.

Pulmonary oedema
This may be life-threatening, particularly in patients
with a reduced urine output. Conventional therapies
may be used – high-flow oxygen, diuretics (high doses
may be necessary), nitrates and opiates (low dose as renally excreted). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be helpful. In the absence of a reasonable
urine output, renal replacement therapy will be
required.

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes an irreversible
reduction in renal function. As serum creatinine has its
limitations in the estimation of GFR (see section on
Glomerular disease), UK laboratories now report estimated GFR (eGFR) values. This procedure has resulted
in the identification of many more patients with chronic
kidney disease in primary care. The majority of these
patients can be managed in primary care as very few
will progress to needing renal replacement therapy.
Their management is focused on prevention of cardiovascular disease and delaying the worsening of renal
failure. The following groups of patients are referred
to secondary care:

• Drugs: analgesic nephropathy; HIV-associated nephropathy is increasingly common.
• Interstitial nephritis: this may be idiopathic but
may also be secondary to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and chronic furosemide use.
• Inherited disease: the two most common conditions
are autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(ADPKD) and Alport’s disease (type IV collagen
defect associated with sensorineural deafness).
• Less common causes are amyloidosis, myeloma,
SLE, gout, hypercalcaemia and retroperitoneal
fibrosis.

eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.

• Severe renal failure (eGFR <30 mL/min).
• Progressive loss of renal function.
• Likely to have intrinsic treatable kidney disease, e.g.
blood and protein in the urine.
• Complications of renal failure, e.g. renal anaemia.
eGFR is used to classify patients with chronic kidney disease (Fig. 33.2). It is estimated that about 5% of the population have chronic kidney disease stage 3 or worse;
this figure exceeds 20% in the population aged over
70 years.

Aetiology
Identifying the cause of chronic kidney disease is important since early treatment can delay or prevent progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF). In addition,
prognosis will be more accurate, risks of recurrence with
renal transplantation can be assessed, and diagnosis of
familial disease may benefit other family members.
Common causes include the following:
• Diabetes mellitus: both insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes can lead to ESRF.
• Hypertension: the incidence of ESRF seems to be decreasing due to better identification and treatment of
hypertension. It is more common in the AfroCaribbean population.
Diabetes and hypertension are responsible for approximately 80% of all patients entering dialysis programmes. Other causes include:
• Glomerular disease: both primary and secondary
(see below).
• Chronic or recurrent infection: mainly due to obstruction or vesicoureteric reflux.
• Obstruction: most cases are due to prostatic hypertrophy and stones.
• Renovascular causes: renovascular atheroma and
consequent ischaemia is becoming increasingly recognized, reflecting the ageing population. Risk factors are the same as for all vascular disease.

276

Clinical features
Progressive loss of renal function per se does not cause
symptoms until the eGFR falls to very low levels
(<30 mL/min; i.e. CKD 4 or 5). Under these circumstances patients may develop fatigue, malaise, thirst, anorexia, nausea and itching. Unfortunately, by this stage
the patient is close to needing dialysis.
When evaluating a patient with chronic kidney disease for the first time the history taken should be similar
to that taken for patients with AKI or haematuria/proteinuria (see Ch. 16). This will cover symptoms that
may reveal an underlying cause. Always remember to
evaluate the patient’s drug history thoroughly.
Uraemic skin is classically ‘lemon yellow’ and there
may be bruising due to platelet dysfunction. Hypertension is common as both a cause and consequence of
chronic kidney disease. Examine for signs of obstruction
(e.g. a palpable bladder) and perform a rectal examination for prostatic hypertrophy or pelvic masses. The
kidneys are large in polycystic disease. Rarer clinical
symptoms or signs include a pericardial rub, pleural
effusion, pulmonary oedema and proximal myopathy.

Investigations
The following are important in the patient with chronic
renal failure:
• Urine: dipstick and microscopy for casts and culture
to exclude infection. If there is proteinuria, send an
ACR (albumin:creatinine ratio) or PCR (protein:creatinine ratio) to quantify this (see below).
• GFR may be estimated using a 24-h urine collection;
this also enables quantification of 24-h urinary protein excretion.
• A cause should be sought and the tests are common
to AKI – autoantibody testing and a myeloma screen
help to rule out treatable pathology.
• Once chronic renal failure is established the following are needed to check for complications and progress: regular blood pressure checks, urinary protein

Chronic kidney disease
estimation and control of diabetes plus haemoglobin (normochromic normocytic anaemia), calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels,
haematinics and lipid profile. Estimation of cardiovascular risk may help to guide intervention (see
below).
• Renal ultrasound should be done to exclude obstruction and assess kidney size.
• Renal biopsy should be considered once prerenal
and postrenal disease have been excluded, especially
if renal size and structure is normal on ultrasound
scan, suggesting more acute disease.

Management
The aims of treatment are to minimize further deterioration in renal function and to prevent or treat the
complications of renal failure. The most significant
complication of chronic kidney disease is premature
cardiovascular disease. This accounts for the high mortality in this group and explains why a large proportion
of these patients do not survive long enough to develop
chronic kidney disease stage 5.
Nephrotoxic drugs should be discontinued and
drugs that are renally excreted may need to be stopped
or reduced in dose.

Prevention of decline in renal function
Hypertension should be tightly controlled (130/
80 mmHg). This usually requires several antihypertensives. Patients with proteinuria derive particular benefit
from the use of drugs that inhibit the renin–angiotensin
system.
In diabetic nephropathy tight control of glycaemia
plus ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
slows the decline in renal function.

Prevention of complications
Cardiovascular
Control of hypertension can slow the deterioration of
renal function and prevent cardiovascular complications. Patients who have suffered a cardiovascular event
should be treated aggressively with antiplatelet and
statin therapy as well as aggressive blood pressure lowering for secondary prevention. There is less evidence in
terms of primary prevention in this group of patients
with chronic kidney disease. Guidelines suggest antiplatelet therapy and a statin in those with an estimated risk
of cardiovascular disease of more than 20% over 10
years.
All patients should also receive lifestyle advice, including smoking cessation if appropriate.

33

Renal osteodystrophy
Renal bone disease is due to a combination of disturbed
vitamin D metabolism and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Serum alkaline phosphatase and phosphate
levels are raised; serum calcium falls. Dietary phosphate
restriction is combined with oral phosphate binders. Serum calcium should be maintained in the normal range
and PTH levels controlled with synthetic vitamin D analogues. Parathyroidectomy may be required if tertiary
hyperparathyroidism supervenes.

Acidosis
Systemic acidosis accompanies declining renal function. It increases myocardial excitability, accelerates renal bone disease and may contribute to increased
potassium levels. Sodium bicarbonate supplements will
help to maintain serum bicarbonate levels within the
normal range. Preliminary evidence suggests that correction of acidosis may help prevent loss of renal
function.

Anaemia
In renal failure there is a normochromic normocytic
anaemia. Evidence of blood loss should be sought if
there is an inappropriately low haemoglobin. Ferritin,
vitamin B12 and folate deficiency should be corrected
with diet and supplements if needed. Recombinant human erythropoietin has improved the management of
anaemia and will increase the haemoglobin and improve symptoms attributable to anaemia but it can
cause hypertension.

Hyperkalaemia
Correction of acidosis and dietary restriction help to
control potassium levels. This can be particularly important in patients on ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin
receptor blockers. As mentioned above, these agents
may reduce the rate of decline of renal function but their
use is associated with hyperkalaemia.

End-stage renal failure
End-stage renal failure is identified on biochemical and
clinical grounds as that point when, despite conservative measures, the patient will die without the institution of renal replacement therapy. Specific indications
for dialysis in ESRF include symptomatic uraemia,
hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis, peripheral neuropathy, pericarditis, central nervous system disorders and
poor control of ESRF by conservative treatment. The
need for dialysis should be predictable, allowing for
the creation of vascular access and education of the
patient well before it is required. Renal replacement
can be done through continuous ambulatory peritoneal
dialysis (CAPD) using a catheter placed into the abdomen to allow fluid in and out, and the dialysis membrane is the peritoneum. The most common method

277

Genitourinary disease
is thrice-weekly haemodialysis via an arteriovenous fistula or indwelling dual-lumen central venous catheter.
Problems with dialysis include loss of vascular access,
infection, hypotension and the maintenance of fluid
and electrolyte balance.
Renal transplantation is increasingly common and
successful (This is largely due to advances in using
non-heart-beating donors). Patients are on immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. tacrolimus, prednisolone and
mycophenolate mofetil), which have their own problems such as susceptibility to opportunistic infections,
and skin malignancies. Other complications of transplantation include acute rejection, obstruction of the
ureteric anastomosis and gradual loss of function with
time (chronic allograft nephropathy).

GLOMERULAR DISEASE
Glomerular disease may be primary or secondary, i.e. a
manifestation of systemic disease (Fig. 33.3). There are
many types of glomerular disease, but all affect the glomerular filtration apparatus, commonly leading to a
unified set of symptoms.

Clinical features
The clinical features of glomerular disease often relate
to the associated reduction in glomerular filtration
rate. This results in acute or chronic renal impairment.
Glomerular disease may also result in defective filtration
and therefore the appearance of blood and/or protein in
the urine (see Ch. 16). Like almost all renal pathologies,
hypertension can also be a feature (Fig. 33.4).
Two distinct syndromes, nephrotic and nephritic, are

Nephritic syndrome
Nephritic syndrome refers to the combination of
proteinuria, haematuria and renal failure.
Oliguria and hypertension are often features and
this syndrome is classically associated with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Nephrotic syndrome
Nephrotic syndrome is the triad of significant proteinuria (>3 g/day), hypoalbuminaemia (albumin
<20 g/L) and peripheral oedema. The oedema is
thought to be due to sodium retention rather than
changes in plasma oncotic pressure. The majority of
cases are due to primary glomerulonephritis; a minority of patients have a causative systemic disease

Glomerular disease
(e.g. diabetes, amyloid, HIV and SLE). Other clinical
features include hyperlipidaemia due to increased hepatic synthesis, a prothrombotic tendency due to urinary loss of antithrombin III, protein C and protein S,
and increased risk of infection due to urinary loss of
immunoglobulins. Renal biopsy is indicated in most
adults.
HINTS AND TIPS
The causes of secondary nephrotic syndrome (i.e. not
of direct renal origin) are DAVID: Diabetes mellitus,
Amyloidosis, Vasculitis, Infections and Drugs.

History
It is important to ask about any urinary symptoms, especially proteinuria and haematuria (e.g. Is there frothy
urine? – see Ch. 16). There may also be a history of previous nephritis, urinary tract infections or stone disease.
Ask about associated systemic diseases (e.g. arthritis, diabetes, hypertension or evidence of malignancy). A full
drug history should be taken including exposure to
toxins.
Hearing impairment is present in Alport’s syndrome,
and there may be a family history of renal disease. Ask
about recent upper respiratory tract infections (poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) and valvular heart
disease.
In younger patients ask about enuresis (suggests
defective urinary concentrating ability, e.g. in reflux
nephropathy) and problems in pregnancy.
HINTS AND TIPS
When taking a drug history be sure to ask directly
about illicit drugs, over-the-counter medication and
herbal remedies.

Investigations
The following investigations are important in the
patient with glomerular disease.

33

Blood tests
• Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests and bone profile. Laboratories in the UK
now routinely report estimated GFR – this is calculated from serum creatinine levels using an equation. Its use is not validated in AKI when the GFR
may be changing rapidly.
• Fasting blood glucose: to exclude diabetes mellitus.
• ESR and CRP.
• Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are
present in microscopic polyangiitis and Wegener’s
granulomatosis.
• Anti-dsDNA and antinuclear antibodies in SLE.
• Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM)
antibodies for the diagnosis of Goodpasture’s
disease.
• Hepatitis B and C serology.
• Antistreptolysin O titre and anti-DNase: recent
streptococcal infection.
• Serum immunoelectrophoresis: to exclude myeloma.
• Rheumatoid factor.
• Cryoglobulins.
• Blood cultures.
• Serum complement levels: C3 and C4 are classically
reduced in active SLE, as well as cryoglobulinaemia
and some forms of glomerulonephritis.

Imaging
• Chest X-ray (CXR): this may show pulmonary oedema, malignancy, pulmonary haemorrhage or cavitation in Wegener’s granulomatosis or anti-GBM
disease.
• Renal ultrasound scan: exclude obstruction and assess renal size/symmetry.

Renal biopsy
• Renal biopsy: to make a histological diagnosis if suspect intrinsic renal disease.
HINTS AND TIPS
Never forget to dipstick the urine in patients with renal
disease. The presence of blood and protein in the urine
should raise the suspicion of intrinsic renal pathology.

Urine
• Urine dipstick: to detect proteinuria and haematuria.
In the presence of proteinuria a urine sample may be
sent for ACR or PCR to quantify severity.
• Urine microscopy for red blood cell casts and dysmorphic red cells indicating glomerular disease.
• Urine for Bence Jones protein.
• 24-h urine collection.

General principles of management
All patients with suspected glomerulonephritis should
be seen by a nephrologist. Although the causes of glomerulonephritis are multiple, tight blood pressure control is advocated if proteinuria is >1 g/dL – this is best
achieved using an ACE inhibitor and/or an angiotensin

279

Genitourinary disease
receptor blocker. Thereafter, specific management is
guided by a firm histological diagnosis, which is also
helpful in prognosis.
Nephrotic syndrome is managed by restricting salt
intake, aggressive blood pressure control (again with
an ACE inhibitor and/or an angiotensin receptor
blocker) and prompt treatment of infections. Often diuretics are used, particularly furosemide, metolazone
or spironalactone, to reduce fluid overload at a rate
of  1 kg/day. Regular U&Es, weight charting and blood
pressure monitoring is an absolute requirement. Hyperlipidaemia and thromboembolism, associated complications of nephrotic syndrome, should be addressed.

Important primary and secondary
glomerular diseases
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
Rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis or crescentic
glomerulonephritis is usually an aggressive process
and presents with renal failure, haematuria, oliguria
and hypertension. The biopsy shows severe acute
inflammation in the glomerulus with necrotizing ‘crescent’ formation. It may occur in SLE, anti-GBM disease
and vasculitides but can occur in the absence of underlying disease. It is a medical emergency. Treatment is
with immunosuppression, commonly high-dose hydrocortisone. The prognosis is usually poor unless treatment is instituted sufficiently early.

ANCA-positive vasculitis
This is typically either Wegener’s granulomatosis
(cANCA against proteinase-3) or microscopic polyangiitis (pANCA against myeloperoxidase). They are both
small-vessel vasculitides causing pulmonary and renal
disease, although other sites can be affected. Wegener’s
causes granulomatous lesions and commonly has upper
airway involvement. Both can cause a rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis and AKI.
Symptoms include malaise, fever, haemoptysis, sinusitis and epistaxis. CXR may show transient shadowing
due to pulmonary haemorrhage and resolution. They
are considered together as treatment is the same:
namely, aggressive immunosuppression and possibly
plasma exchange. Most enter complete remission with
treatment; if the response is incomplete, long-term renal
support may be needed.

Antiglomerular basement membrane
disease
This condition is associated with the presence of circulating antibodies against collagen resulting in damage
to the alveolar and glomerular basement membranes.

280

Goodpasture’s syndrome is anti-GBM disease associated
with pulmonary haemorrhage. Other ‘pulmonary–renal
syndromes’ include SLE, Wegener’s granulomatosis and
microscopic polyangiitis.
Treatments with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive drugs remove and suppress the antibody,
together with the reversal of its renal and pulmonary effects.
HINTS AND TIPS
Always think of urgent referral to a nephrologist when
you see a patient with haemoptysis and renal failure,
i.e. pulmonary–renal syndrome. If caught in time,
therapy is more likely to be successful.

IgA nephropathy
IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease) is the most common
acute glomerulonephritis worldwide. This condition is
classically associated with ‘synpharyngitic’ haematuria,
i.e. macroscopic haematuria 1–2 days after an upper respiratory tract infection. In contrast, post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis usually follows a delay of 1–2
weeks. Other presentations include microscopic haematuria, proteinuria and renal impairment.
Steroids and immunosuppression are not very effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the
mainstay of treatment. Approximately 25% of patients
will go on to require dialysis. Henoch–Schönlein purpura has much in common with IgA nephropathy
and can be thought of as its systemic cousin.

Lupus nephritis
SLE is a multisystem disease and the kidneys are commonly
affected. The changes are classified by the World Health
Organization from I–V based on histology. The different
types lead to presentations varying from nephritis to
nephritic syndrome. Typically, the anti-double-stranded
DNA titres and ESR are raised with a normal CRP and
C3 and C4 levels are low in active lupus. If treatment is indicated, steroids and cyclophosphamide are the mainstay.

Minimal change nephropathy
This accounts for 80% of children and 20% of adults in
the UK who present with nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy is therefore not always indicated in children. Light
microscopy is normal (hence the name) but electron
microscopy shows podocyte foot process fusion. There
is usually significant proteinuria, which responds to corticosteroid therapy in the majority of children (90%)
and adults (75%). Relapsing episodes are treated with
cyclophosphomide or ciclosporin. The development
of renal failure is rare (<1%).

33

Urinary tract infections

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
Nephrotic syndrome is the most frequent presentation.
It can be idiopathic but is associated with a wide range
of systemic diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-associated nephropathy is increasingly common
and causes a characteristic ‘collapsing’ FSGS.
Treatment with high-dose steroids can induce
remission but progression to end-stage renal failure is
common.

Membranous glomerulonephritis
This condition accounts for about a quarter of all cases of
nephrotic syndrome. The cause is often unknown, but diagnosis is made by biopsy which shows characteristic diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane.
The condition is associated with malignancy, drugs (e.g.
gold), autoimmune conditions such as SLE or rheumatoid
arthritis, and infections. If left untreated 40% resolve
spontaneously; mainstay medical management is with
corticosteroids with cyclophosphamide.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
This condition, also known as mesangicapillary glomerulonephritis, is characterized be immunocomplex deposits in the glomerular mesangium and basement
membrane thickening. It is associated with chronic infections, autoimmune disorders such as SLE and chronic
thrombotic microangiopathies It may cause nephritic
syndrome. There are three types of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Type I is caused by
immunocomplex deposition, often in association with
hepatitis C infection, and causes activation of the classical
complement pathway and immune deposits in mesangium and subendothelial space. Type II (dense deposit
disease) is similar to type I but is associated with activation of the alternative complement pathway. Furthermore, type II is associated with drusen, a condition
that causes blindness through similar deposition in the
Bruch’s membrane in the retina. Type III is very rare
and is characterized by subendothelial and subepithelial
deposits. Treatment of MPGN focuses on symptom control and aggressive immunosuppression and plasmapheresis in severe cases. Prognosis is poor – 50% of patients
develop ESRF at 10 years.

Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
This condition, also known as acute proliferative glomerulonephritis, is a complication of streptococcal
pharyngitis (strep throat) or impetigo. Clinically, it is
characterized by sudden-onset haematuria, proteinuria,
oedema, hypertension. There commonly is a latent
period after the infection; 1–2 weeks for strep throat
and typically 6–8 weeks for impetigo. Treatment is

symptomatic (i.e. treat hypertension, oedema and
hyperkalaemia). Immunosuppression is not indicated.
Prognosis is good in children; recovery in adults may
be complicated by congestive cardiac failure.

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections encountered in medical practice, and in
the elderly population can rapidly cause sepsis. Women
are more prone to UTIs than men, except during the first
few months of life and in old age. Approximately
25–35% of all women describe symptoms of a UTI at
some stage in their lives.
UTI is a general term referring to the presence of microorganisms in the urine. Significant bacteriuria is defined as urine that yields a pure growth of more than
100 000 organisms per millilitre on culture. Predisposing
factors for UTI are given in Fig. 33.5. Broadly speaking
UTIs are divided into those affecting the lower urinary
tract (urethra, prostate, bladder) or upper urinary tract
(kidneys). A further distinction is made between uncomplicated (normal renal tract and function) and complicated (abnormal renal or genitourinary tract, impaired
host defences or virulent organism) UTIs.

Lower urinary tract infections
Lower UTIs may take the following forms:
• Cystitis: a symptomatic infection of the bladder with
significant bacteriuria.
• Asymptomatic bacteriuria: the patient has no symptoms, but urine culture yields a growth of over
100 000/mL.
• Acute urethral syndromes: symptomatically similar
to cystitis but the urine culture may be sterile.

Upper urinary tract infections
Upper UTIs may take the following forms:
• Acute pyelonephritis: an inflammatory process
within the renal parenchyma, most commonly
caused by bacterial infection.

Stones
Obstruction
Polycystic kidneys
Papillary necrosis
Diabetes mellitus
Analgesic nephropathy
Sickle cell disease
Sexual intercourse
Pregnancy
Bladder catheterization

281

Genitourinary disease
• Chronic pyelonephritis: this is usually the result of
long-standing or recurrent bacterial infection with
eventual parenchymal scarring characteristic of
chronic pyelonephritic kidneys. Vesicoureteric reflux
and obstruction also contribute. Hypertension and
chronic renal failure may ensue. It is more common
in children.
Infection usually occurs by ascent of the invading organism from the urethra into the bladder. Colonization of
the ureters may occur, and from there to the kidneys.
The haematogenous route of infection is less common
but may occur secondarily to bacteraemia, septicaemia
or endocarditis.

Clinical features
Symptoms of lower UTI are suprapubic pain, frequency,
nocturia, dysuria (classically ‘burning’) and strangury.
Upper UTIs such as acute pyelonephritis or renal abscesses present with fever, rigors, loin pain, vomiting
and weight loss. Macroscopic haematuria can occur in
one-third of severe cases. In the elderly, the presentation
may be very non-specific with mild cognitive, behavioural and mobility changes.

Investigations
A clean, midstream urine sample should be obtained
and a dipstick test done for blood, protein, leucocytes
and nitrites; subsequently it should be sent for microscopy and culture. White cell count and CRP will be
raised in infection. Urea and electrolytes may demonstrate poor renal function. Obvious predisposing factors
such as pregnancy, diabetes or indwelling catheter
should be considered. Indications for further investigations include recurrent infections, childhood onset,
male sex, urological symptoms, persistent haematuria,
especially if aged over 40 years, unusual organisms
(such as Pseudomonas) and recurrence of infections.
Renal tract ultrasound should be performed for UTI
in children, men, if >2 episodes/year, failure to respond
to treatment, pyelonephritis, unusual organism or persistent haematuria. A DMSA scan can be performed to
assess renal function and is a reliable test for diagnosing
pyelonephritis.
HINTS AND TIPS
The causes of sterile pyuria (a common exam question)
include:
• Tuberculosis of the urinary tract.
• Analgesic nephropathy.
• Partially treated UTI.
• Neoplasia.
• Intra-abdominal inflammation.

282

Management
Treatment should be started after urine has been sent for
culture and antibiotic sensitivities but, commonly, before results are available. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
may then be changed if necessary according to the results. High fluid intake should be encouraged. More
than 80% of lower UTIs respond to a short course of
an antibiotic such as trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin or
amoxicillin. For complicated UTIs a 5–10-day course of
therapy is indicated. Follow-up microscopy and culture
should be carried out to ensure eradication of organisms
and pyuria. Patients with acute pyelonephritis usually require admission to hospital for IV fluids and antibiotics.
Patients with recurrent infections require a high fluid
intake; frequent and complete voiding should be
encouraged. Long-term, low-dose prophylaxis using
rotating antibiotics may be of benefit but the need
for continued treatment should be reassessed after
6 months.
If infection is related to sexual intercourse, the
patient should void after intercourse and may benefit
from a single dose of an antibiotic.

RENAL CALCULI
Renal calculi (kidney stones) are common cause for attendance in the Emergency Department. Men are more likely
to be affected than women, with the initial presentation
usually in the third and fourth decades of life. Most are calcium containing and most are radio-opaque (80%). They
include calcium oxalate, calcium oxalate/phosphate, calcium phosphate and triple phosphate staghorn stones.
Urate and xanthine stones are radiolucent.

Aetiology
Predisposing factors are dehydration, infection, hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria, gout and high oxalate intake (chocolate, instant coffee and spinach).

Clinical features
The classic presenting complaint of renal calculi is colicky pain – severe loin pain radiating to the groin associated with nausea and vomiting. Frank haematuria
may occur, but more commonly haematuria is microscopic.

Investigations and management
Renal colic is a typical ‘end of the bed’ diagnosis – the
patient is restless, clutching their loin and often appears
pale. Diagnosis is based on a suggestive history, examination and haematuria on urine dipstick. If these are

Urinary tract malignancies
present, a CT KUB (kidney/ureter/bladder) scan should
be performed (the gold standard for diagnosis of renal
calculi). The scan will also help in determining whether
there is any associated hydronephrosis, which may require urgent referral to the urologists. Acute treatment
is analgesia with NSAIDs (typically diclofenac), fluids
and antibiotics if indicated. Often tamsulosin is advised
to relax the ureteric smooth muscle. Urinary tract obstruction needs urological intervention, especially if infection is a possibility. Ureteric decompression is
achieved through a double J stent. Most stones, however, pass spontaneously (typically those <4 mm); if
they do not then they can be crushed endoscopically
or fragmented with lithotripsy. To avoid future stones,
the patient should avoid dehydration and excess dietary
calcium oxalate or phosphate.
HINTS AND TIPS
Patients with renal colic typically complain of ‘loin to
groin’ pain. They will be unable to lie still and
often feel nauseated with the pain. Typically NSAIDs
are a better analgesic than morphine.

URINARY TRACT MALIGNANCIES

33

5-year survival is approximately 40% but is better if the
tumour is confined to the renal parenchyma and worse
if there are metastases or lymph node involvement.
HINTS AND TIPS
Tumours presenting with polycythaemia include renal
cell carcinoma, hepatoma and cerebellar
haemangioblastoma.

Transitional cell carcinoma
This occurs mainly in those aged over 40 years and most
commonly affects the bladder, although the ureter and
renal pelvis are other sites. It is three times more common in men than women. Predisposing factors include
cigarette smoking, exposure to industrial carcinogens,
exposure to drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide) and chronic
inflammation (e.g. schistosomiasis).
Patients usually present with painless haematuria, although pain may occur. There may be symptoms similar
to UTI. Investigations include urine cytology, IVU,
cystourethroscopy and abdominal CT scanning.
Treatment options include local resection with regular follow-up cystoscopy, cystectomy, radiotherapy and
local or systemic chemotherapy.

Renal cell carcinoma

Prostatic carcinoma

Renal cell carcinoma (hypernephroma) is the commonest renal tumour in adults and is twice as common in
men. The peak age of onset is between 50 and 60 years
of age. It may be solitary, multiple or occasionally bilateral. The classic triad of haematuria, loin pain and a palpable mass is found in only 10% of patients. Other
features may include cough, pyrexia, polycythaemia,
anaemia, bone pain with hypercalcaemia, and left-sided
varicocele associated with left renal vein obstruction. A
tendency to grow into the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a
typical characteristic. About a quarter of patients present
with metastases. Fifty per cent of renal cell carcinomas
are incidental findings on CT.
Investigations include urinalysis for red cells, ultrasound, then CT scan of the kidneys, CXR (cannon ball
metastases), bone scan for metastases and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen to assess IVC spread.
Treatment is by radical nephrectomy if possible, although nephron sparing surgery and laparoscopic procedures are becoming more common. Metastases may
regress after the primary tumour is removed. This can
be enhanced with interferon-alpha and interleukin-2
administration. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy has
not proven to be very effective, but recent developments
in monoclonal antibodies to for example tyrosine kinase and VEGF are looking promising. The overall

Prostatic carcinoma is the second most common malignancy in men. The incidence increases with age and
may be very indolent. Patients are often asymptomatic
but may present with symptoms of ‘prostatism’ (e.g.
hesitancy, frequency, nocturia and postmicturition
dribbling), or with symptoms arising from metastatic
spread, especially to bone. There is a hard irregular
prostate on rectal examination.
Investigation includes prostate-specific antigen
(PSA), transrectal ultrasound and prostatic biopsy
(Gleeson score to assess tumour grade), which shows
an adenocarcinoma. Evidence of local invasion, nodal
spread and metastases should also be sought (staging).
Treatment for local disease may be observation
alone, transurethral resection of the prostate, radical
prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Testosterone is a growth
factor for prostate cancer and therefore it responds well
to antagonizing its effect. This can be achieved with
orchidectomy, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
analogues (e.g. goserelin) and antiandrogens (e.g. cyproterone acetate).
Prognosis even with metastases may be excellent if
the tumour responds to hormonal treatment.
The PSA is very useful as a tumour marker to allow
the response to therapy to be assessed when prostate
disease is present. However, how to screen for prostate

283

Genitourinary disease
cancer and how to follow up abnormal PSA tests is a
cause of much debate for urologists and public health
authorities. Currently it does not meet criteria for a
national screening programme.

cause can be found. Hence the exclusion of sepsis, hypovolaemia, nephrotoxic drugs and nephritis is paramount, not least because they may be easily
remediable. It is divided into:

Testicular cancer

• HRS 1: rapidly progressive renal failure often in
acute liver failure, alcoholic hepatitis or decompensation of chronic disease.
• HRS 2: more slowly progressive renal failure, often
over months.

Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy to affect males in their second to fourth decade. Typical presentation is a painless testicular mass. Risk factors
include maldescended testicle, infant hernia and infertility. The most common varieties are derived from germ
cells and include seminomas and teratomas. Much rarer
are tumours derived from cord or gonadal stroma cells
which include Sertoli and Leydig cell tumours.
Excision and biopsy allows for histological assessment and guides further investigation and treatment.
All patients have a CT scan to rule out metastases.
Alpha-fetoprotein and beta-HcG are tumour markers
which are particularly helpful in monitoring response
to treatment.
Treatment is orchidectomy. Seminomas are extremely
sensitive to radiotherapy. Teratomas respond well to
combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, cisplatin
and etoposide. Five-year survival is >90% for all groups.

The aetiology is unknown. It is characterized by renal vasoconstriction and decreased perfusion pressures and
peripheral and splanchnic vasodilatation. Resulting activation of the renin–angiotensin axis and release of neuropeptide compounds the problem by causing further
renal vasoconstriction. It occurs in  20% of patients
with liver cirrhosis in the presence of ascites. Kidney biopsy is always normal in HRS. This is emphasized in
treatment as it is mainly supportive and renal function
recovers if the liver recovers, including after liver transplantation. Combinations of octreotide, vasopressin analogues, midodrine and dopamine have all been tried to
improve renal haemodynamics but no treatment is especially advantageous. Prognosis is usually poor.

Thrombotic microangiopathies
MISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS

Adult polycystic kidney disease
This is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease, the
genes (PKD2 and PKD1) lying on chromosomes 4 and
16 respectively. Patients are usually between the ages of
30 and 50 years. Cysts develop in the kidney and lead to
progressive renal failure. Approximately 40% of patients
also have cysts in the liver. Haematuria, infection,
stones or abdominal pain are common presenting features. If due to a new mutation, established renal impairment may be the first sign. There is an association
with subarachnoid haemorrhage due to intracranial
‘berry’ aneurysms (typically at the anterior communicating artery of the circle of Willis).
Examination reveals large irregular palpable kidneys,
and the patient is often hypertensive. Mitral valve prolapse, diverticular disease and hernias are also increased
in frequency. Ultrasound shows multiple cysts. CT provides greater detail. Blood pressure should be controlled
and infections treated. Decline in renal function is progressive and may necessitate dialysis or renal transplantation. Screening of first-degree relatives and genetic
counselling is recommended.

Hepatorenal syndrome
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is defined as renal failure
in patients with severe liver disease for which no other

284

This term encompasses haemolytic uraemic syndrome
(HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP). HUS is a disorder characterized by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, normal coagulation and no neurological
changes. These separate it from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and TTP (with which it shares many
features; see Ch. 37). It may follow diarrhoea in children
(especially from Escherichia coli O157:H7), although
this is less common in adults. In adults the prognosis
is worse. Treatment includes plasma exchange, steroids
and renal support. A large proportion of patients will
need long-term dialysis even with treatment.

FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE
BALANCE
As a house officer you will frequently prescribe IV fluids
and be responsible for checking your patients’ electrolytes. As such, understanding basic fluid balance and
electrolyte homeostasis is important.
In a 70-kg man, the total fluid volume is 42 L (i.e.
60% of the body weight). The intracellular fluid volume
is 28 L or two-thirds of the total body fluid, and the extracellular fluid volume is 14 L or a third of the total
body fluid. The intravascular component is 3 L (plasma
contributing to 5 L of blood).

33

Fluid and electrolyte balance
The average total fluid intake in 24 h is 2500 mL
(1500 mL drunk, 800 mL in food and 200 mL via the
metabolism of food). The output matches this via urine,
insensible loss and stool.
Sodium ingestion is approximately 2 mmol/kg in
24 h and potassium is approximately 1 mmol/kg
in 24 h.
Understanding the above requirements will help you
in prescribing fluids in a sensible and appropriate manner. Generally speaking, fluids can be divided into crystalloids (e.g. ‘normal’ saline or Hartmann’s solution) or
colloids (e.g. Gelofusine or Volulyte).

• What is the urinary sodium value?
For example, in hypovolaemia secondary to dehydration or diarrhoea, the kidneys retain salt and water
resulting in low (<20 mmol/L) urinary sodium. Diuretics or mineralocorticoid deficiency will cause hypovolaemia with a high urinary sodium (>20 mmol/L).
With this information the diagnostic algorithm shown
in Fig. 33.6 can be followed.
Treatment depends on the cause. If the patient is
dehydrated then volume replacement with normal saline is required. Fluid restriction for SIADH is correct.
Beware of diagnosing it in hospital patients admitted
for other reasons, because fluid-restricting a dehydrated
patient is a well-recognized cause of AKI. The sodium
level should not rise at more than 1 mmol/L/h as
central pontine myelinolysis can ensue. This is osmotically induced demyelination. Severe hyponatraemia
(<115 mmol/L) can cause confusion and seizures. It
is an emergency and treatment with 0.9% or 1.8% saline
to raise the levels to >120 mmol/L is sometimes indicated. In reality this is a contentious issue and twice normal saline is infrequently used.
SIADH is characterized by hyponatraemia, low plasma
osmolality, inappropriately increased urine osmolality
(>500 mOsmol/kg, urinary sodium >20 mmol/L without hypovolaemia, cardiac, renal, adrenal and hepatic disease. Causes are shown in Fig. 33.7.

Sodium and water balance
Disorders of sodium homeostasis are common. Total
body sodium is reflected in the extracellular volume
and is regulated by baroreceptors and the renin–
angiotensin system. Serum sodium concentration is
determined by water balance and is regulated by osmoreceptors and antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/thirst.

Hyponatraemia
New-onset hyponatraemia is frequent in hospital practice. It is rarely due to the legion of potential causes, especially the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone production (SIADH). It is usually the result
of neurohumoral changes in acute illness and the type,
volume and route of fluid administered. To evaluate
chronic hyponatraemia three questions should be
answered:

Hypernatraemia
Hypernatraemia usually results from reduced intake or
increased loss of water. Causes include dehydration and
diabetes insipidus (Fig. 33.8). Excess saline replacement
can be the cause in hospital.

(but not more than 20 mmol/h).

Hyperkalaemia
The causes of hyperkalaemia are given in Fig. 33.10.

Treatment is again that of the cause and appropriate
fluid replacement. The sodium level should be reduced
no faster than 1 mmol/L/h to avoid rapid fluid shifts
and cerebral oedema. Normal saline can be used as it
may have a lower osmolality than the blood and will
not abruptly lower the sodium level.

Potassium balance
Hypokalaemia
The causes of hypokalaemia are given in Fig. 33.9. It
may be useful to assess the urinary potassium to help
distinguish urinary from other losses. The clinical features of hypokalaemia are muscle weakness, confusion,
ileus, increased cardiac excitability, augmented digoxin
toxicity, thirst, polyuria, renal lesions (e.g. Fanconi’s
syndrome), interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis in severe prolonged depletion.

Management
The underlying cause should be identified and treated.

achieved by utilizing physiological mechanisms: potassium can be temporarily redistributed into cells using an
infusion of 50% dextrose and insulin and nebulized salbutamol. This can be repeated if needed. If the patient is
acidotic, the use of bicarbonate can help this. Remember that these interventions only redistribute potassium
between compartments and provide a window of opportunity for definitive therapy to excrete potassium from
the body. The only way of achieving potassium excretion
acutely is in the urine. Therefore, oligoanuric patients
with severe hyperkalaemia require urgent dialysis to
achieve potassium removal.
Significant hyperkalaemia is commonly associated
with typical ECG changes (Fig. 33.11). These ECG
changes can be reversed temporarily by boluses of
10% calcium gluconate, which acts to stabilize the myocardial membrane.

CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE

Stroke and TIA
Introduction and definition
A stroke is a focal neurological deficit, caused by a
vascular lesion, that lasts for more than 24 h. Approximately 80% are due to infarction secondary to thrombosis or embolism, and 20% are due to intracerebral
haemorrhage. If the symptoms last less than 24 h
(though usually much less) they are termed ‘transient
ischaemic attacks’ (TIA). These are usually due to
emboli. The annual incidence of stroke is about 150
in 100 000 but rises with age so that the incidence at
75 years is 1000 in 100 000; the incidence of TIA is approximately 50 in 100 000. Around 11% of patients
with a TIA have a stroke in the next 90 days, many in
the days shortly following the TIA. TIA therefore needs
to be investigated carefully.

Aetiology and pathophysiology
Risk factors for stroke are summarized in Fig. 24.3.
The main causes of ischaemic stroke are thromboembolism from arteries and emboli from the heart. Uncommon causes of cerebral infarction are vasculitis, arterial
dissection, venous sinus thrombosis (which may also
cause haemorrhage), polycythaemia and meningovascular syphilis. Thrombus in situ may also occur in
perforating arteries, often due to lipohyalinosis as a complication of hypertension. The risk factors for TIA are
identical, and the underlying disease process very similar,

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00034-8

the main cause being embolism from a distant source.
Other possible causes include thrombotic occlusion of
small perforating vessels, low flow through stenosed vessels, vasculitis and haematological conditions such as
sickle cell disease. Although the symptoms of TIA resolve
within 24 h, infarction may have occurred.
Cerebral haemorrhage is usually due to rupture of
perforating arteries or intracerebral vessels (primary intracerebral haemorrhage); the main underlying causes
are hypertension (causing vessel fragility and microaneurysms) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Rarely,
cerebral haemorrhage is secondary to other pathologies
(e.g. arteriovenous malformations, tumour, abscess or
blood dyscrasias).
HINTS AND TIPS
The sudden onset of any symptom usually suggests a
vascular aetiology.

Clinical features
Signs and symptoms usually appear rapidly, often
over seconds, whereas a gradual progression suggests
another pathology (e.g. tumour). The most common
presentation of stroke is with hemiplegia due to occlusion of the middle cerebral or internal carotid artery
causing infarction of the internal capsule.
The Bamford classification is now widely used in
clinical practice and is also a useful guide to prognosis
(see Ch. 24, Fig. 24.5). The diagnosis of stroke is made
clinically and the physical findings are interpreted to
predict which part of the cerebral circulation has been

289

Central nervous system
affected. Motor signs are upper motor neurone. Lacunar
strokes result from small areas of infarction affecting the
internal capsule, basal ganglia, thalamus and pons.
In TIA, as for stroke, the symptoms depend on the
size of the emboli and the distribution of the artery affected. The symptoms resolve gradually over minutes to
hours, with complete recovery within 24 h. Recurrent
TIAs in the same carotid artery territory occurring closely
together in time may be due to an unstable plaque, and
are often termed ‘crescendo TIA’.

haemorrhage). In some cases imaging MUST be performed urgently (see Ch. 24), as urgent intervention
may be required. Brain imaging in TIA is helpful to
exclude other causes of transient symptoms and to
look for areas of previous silent infarction; this
may be done at an urgent follow-up appointment.
Echocardiogram: especially if you suspect a cardiac
embolic source (e.g. bilateral infarcts) and the
patient is suitable for anticoagulation.
Carotid Doppler ultrasound scan: performed for anterior circulation events where the patient makes a
good recovery and would be suitable for carotid
surgery if a significant stenosis (>70%) is found.
Thrombophilia screen: for patients <55 years, in the
absence of other risk factors, following multiple
episodes (see Ch. 37).
Autoimmune screen: if vasculitis is suspected.
Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography: if arterial
dissection or venous sinus thrombosis is suspected.

The investigations that should be performed following
stroke are detailed below; patients with established
stroke should always be admitted. Following TIA, the investigations are very similar due to the risk of further
stroke; to help decide whether the patient should be admitted for investigation, or seen with an urgent outpatient appointment, risk stratification is performed using
a scoring system such as the ABCD2 score (see Fig. 34.1).

•

• Full blood count (FBC): polycythaemia or thrombocytopenia. Sickling tests in Afro-Caribbean patients.
• Electrolytes: dehydration.
• Clotting screen: bleeding disorders.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): vasculitis including giant cell arteritis.
• Blood glucose: hyper- or hypoglycaemia.
• Chest X-ray (CXR): primary tumour, aspiration
pneumonia.
• Imaging: CT or MRI should be performed promptly
in stroke to distinguish haemorrhage from infarction; MRI is preferred for posterior circulation
strokes as it provides better images of the posterior
fossa. It is also helpful in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (especially to exclude tumour and subdural

Differential diagnosis
Establishing the diagnosis may be difficult, especially in
the case of TIA, and the differential includes anything
that may cause transient neurological symptoms. Epilepsy is usually distinguished by features such as jerking,
and migraine is usually associated with headache, which
is rare in TIAs. Hypoglycaemia must be excluded, and
in the history any features of multiple sclerosis or intracranial lesions should be sought. Occasionally, phaeochromocytoma or malignant hypertension can mimic
TIA. Attacks with loss of consciousness should not be
regarded as TIAs.

Treatment
• Thrombolysis in selected patients with ischaemic
stroke is beneficial when given up to 4.5 h after
symptom onset. Patients need to be quickly and carefully assessed, including an NIHSS score calculation
(which is a measure of the severity of the stroke and
helps judge whether thrombolysis will be beneficial)
and an urgent brain scan is required. There are many
contraindications which must be excluded.
• Antiplatelets: evidence of small but significant prognostic benefit if given in first 48 h after stroke. Aspirin
(300 mg) should be started immediately and continued for 2 weeks, after which long-term secondary

prevention is implemented (see below). Clopidogrel
can be given if aspirin is contraindicated. Studies suggest that if CT is likely to be delayed, the first dose can
be given empirically without increased risk if the
stroke is found to be haemorrhagic. All patients with
TIA should be started on antiplatelet therapy.
Swallow assessment: required to assess risk of aspiration. Give IV fluids if swallowing is compromised to
maintain hydration.
Stroke unit: management in a specialized unit has
been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity.
Supportive therapy: monitoring of pressure areas,
for infection and complications like hydrocephalus;
nutrition; physiotherapy; occupational therapy;
speech and language therapy.
Neurosurgical review is required for brain haemorrhage, especially posterior fossa as surgical drainage
may be life saving, and for life-threatening cerebral oedema following ischaemic stroke (malignant MCA
syndrome) when decompression may be possible.
Blood pressure should be monitored carefully; hypertension should not be treated unless extreme
(systolic 220 mmHg) or there are other indications
(e.g. encephalopathy, heart failure, significant coronary artery disease) as reduction may worsen infarction due to impaired cerebral autoregulation of
blood flow.
Blood glucose: this should be monitored and controlled if necessary with IV insulin (sliding scale).
Hyperglycaemia is associated with a worse outcome.

COMMUNICATION
If the patient is unconscious or severely impaired, a
decision on the most appropriate degree of intervention
needs to be taken in liaison with relatives, and the
patient if possible. Factors to consider include prognosis,
quality of life and the patient’s wishes.

Prevention
Preventing further strokes (secondary prevention) is
critical. These patients are also at elevated risk of cardiovascular events at other sites – it is also important to target this risk.
• Current NICE guidelines advocate the use of clopidogrel as first-line agent for secondary prevention following stroke, and combined aspirin/dipyridamole
following TIA. If any single agent is not tolerated,
other agents can be tried.
• Anticoagulant therapy should be started for cardioembolic strokes associated with atrial fibrillation, and
possibly for those occurring less than 3 months after
myocardial infarction (presumed cardioembolic).

Score 2 is generally taken as an indication for anticoagulation.

It should also be considered for primary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. The risks and
benefits of anticoagulation need to be considered
and discussed with the patient; scoring systems such
as CHADS2 (Fig. 34.2) or CHADS2-VASc may help.
Anticoagulation is avoided in the 10–14 days following
infarction due to the risk of bleeding into friable,
infarcted brain. For a long time warfarin was the
only available agent, but newer direct thrombin/factor
Xa inhibitors have been developed. Dabigatran is
recommended by NICE as an alternative to warfarin
and has better efficacy and side-effect profile.
• Blood pressure and cholesterol (aim for total
cholesterol <4 mmol/L, low-density cholesterol
<2 mmol/L, or 25% reduction) should be lowered.
This applies even if they are not particularly raised as
these patients have a high absolute cardiovascular
risk (see Chs 30 and 35).
• Carotid endarterectomy: for patients with anterior
circulation ischaemic strokes (or transient ischaemic
attacks (TIAs) – see below) who make a good recovery and have a stenosis >70% in the culprit artery
without near occlusion.
• Advice and help with smoking cessation and other
lifestyle measures should be given.
HINTS AND TIPS
Global rather than focal problems (such as dizziness
and syncope) are rarely explained by TIAs.

Extra-axial haemorrhage
Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is due to bleeding
into the subarachnoid space. The annual incidence is
15 in 100 000. Most cases (about 80%) are due to rupture of a saccular aneurysm in the circle of Willis and its
adjacent branches (see Fig. 24.2); 15% are multiple.
Estimated population prevalence of aneurysms is

291

Central nervous system
around 5%; hence most aneurysms do not rupture. The
remaining 20% of SAH are mostly due to perimesencephalic haemorrhage (a relatively benign subtype) or
vascular malformations.
Risk factors for aneurysm formation and rupture
overlap, and include genetic factors (including the welldefined conditions autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome), coarctation of the aorta, smoking and hypertension.
Haemorrhage may occasionally be due to ruptured
mycotic aneurysm from endocarditis and bleeding
diatheses.

Clinical features
The classic history is of a sudden-onset severe headache
that feels like a blow to the head or back of the neck.
Around 30% are preceded by a less severe headache
due to a small ‘sentinel’ haemorrhage. Severity is maximal at onset or in the following seconds. This is usually
followed by faintness, nausea, vomiting and sometimes
loss of consciousness or seizures.
On examination, there may be photophobia and
features of meningism (see Ch. 18) although this may
take some hours to develop. If bleeding continues, the
level of consciousness deteriorates. There may be signs
of raised intracranial pressure or pressure effects on surrounding structures causing focal neurological deficits.
Large arteriovenous malformations occasionally cause
an audible bruit over the skull. Deficits appearing later
may relate to vasospasm, re-bleeding or hydrocephalus,
and seizures may occur. Non-neurological complications include neurogenic pulmonary oedema, cardiac
arrhythmia and SIADH.

Investigations
A CT scan shows blood in the subarachnoid space in
90–95% of cases if performed within 24 h, and it can also
identify arteriovenous malformations. A lumbar puncture shows xanthochromia (yellow colour due to haemoglobin degradation products), which develops after
approximately 12 h and persists for several days. It is present in all cases. Consecutive samples should be equally
bloodstained (though this is not a reliable sign), and the
CSF pressure is often raised. To identify a causative aneurysm, the gold standard is digital subtraction angiography. However, CT/MR angiography is usually quicker
to organize and has fewer complications. Either technique allows planning of the optimal treatment method.
HINTS AND TIPS
Approximately 5% of SAH are missed by CT scan on
day 1 and sensitivity decreases over time; therefore an
appropriately timed lumbar puncture for
xanthochromia is necessary to exclude the diagnosis.

292

Management
Immediate treatment is bed rest, analgesia and supportive measures. The neurosurgeons should be consulted
early. Up to one-sixth of patients re-bleed, most within
the first 8 h. If untreated, the risk of re-bleeding may be
as high as 50% at 6 months. Angiography should therefore be performed as quickly as possible to identify the
culprit aneurysm and plan surgical clipping or endovascular coiling. Blood pressure should be monitored and
lowered if severely raised.
Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker that acts preferentially on cerebral arteries, should be given at 60 mg
4-hourly to prevent vascular spasm following SAH. It
should be started within 4 days and continued for 21 days,
and is proven to reduce mortality. Fluid intake should be
at least 3 L/day to avoid hypovolaemia and hypotension.

Prognosis
The mortality rate of SAH is 50%; 10–15% will die before
they reach hospital. Patients who have severe neurological deficits have a poor prognosis. Late re-bleeding
and epilepsy are complications that may develop after
discharge from hospital and long-term psyschosocial
dysfunction is common.

Subdural haematoma (SDH)
This is due to bleeding from bridging veins between the
cortex and venous sinuses. Acute SDH due to severe
trauma is life threatening with a high mortality, and presents shortly following the event. In chronic SDH, an
initial small haemorrhage gradually enlarges by absorbing fluid osmotically from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
It is more common in those with brain atrophy such as
the elderly and alcoholics. Although it is often secondary
to trauma, the initial event may not be recalled.
Symptoms of SDH are often global and may develop
insidiously. They include headache, confusion, a fluctuating level of consciousness and sometimes a personality
change. There may be focal neurological signs (which can
develop many days after the initial insult), signs of raised
intracranial pressure or secondary epilepsy.
A CT scan should show the haematoma, which may
be bilateral (Fig. 34.3). As the clot breaks down at
around 7 days post-event it becomes transiently isodense to the brain, making it harder to identify on the
scan. Treatment is by removal of the haematoma, which
often leads to a full recovery if performed early.
Haematomas may resolve spontaneously, and in
those patients carrying a high risk of surgery can be
monitored with serial CT scans.

Extradural haematoma
This results from tearing of the middle meningeal artery
or its branches following head injury, causing bleeding
into the space between the dura and the skull.

Powell and Dr Alex Roberts, Royal Liverpool University
Hospital.)

The classic picture is of a sudden brief loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval. With severe EDH and a
rapidly expanding haematoma the patient then develops
headache, reduced conscious level and signs of raised
ICP. There may be seizures and ipsilateral pupil dilation
(a ‘false localizing sign’), followed by death due to brain
herniation. The location of the bleeding causes a characteristically biconvex haematoma (Fig. 34.3). Treatment is
by evacuation of the clot through burr hole or open
craniotomy.

HEADACHE SYNDROMES
The approach to the patient with headache is described
in Ch. 18. Specific types of headache are considered
here. The clinical approach to headache depends on a
detailed analysis of symptoms and a thorough general
and neurological examination.

COMMUNICATION
History taking is of paramount importance in patients
complaining of headache. Listen and allow the
story to unfold. There may be hidden fears of an
underlying tumour.

Migraine
Migraine affects approximately 10% of the population
and is more common in women than in men (ratio
of 1.5:1). Approximately 75% of sufferers have their first
attack before the age of 20 years.

The frequency of headaches varies from one to two each
week to a few attacks scattered over a lifetime. Premonitory symptoms in the 24 h prior to headache occur in
around 60% of sufferers and may consist of yawning,
euphoria, depression, irritability and sometimes a craving for or a distaste of food.
In 25% of cases an aura is experienced 30–60 min
before the headache. It is usually visual, consisting of
teichopsias (flashes of light), scotomata and fortification spectra (zigzag lines). Objects may appear small
(micropsia) or distorted (metamorphopsia). Paraesthesiae of the hands or face may occur and are often
followed by numbness. In hemiplegic migraine, a hemiparesis, sometimes with dysphasia, occurs. Other focal
neurological phenomena have been described. The
symptoms develop gradually and are fully reversible.
The headache is commonly unilateral. It usually
starts during the day and is classically throbbing or pulsating. Commonly associated features include nausea
and vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. The
headache is usually worse with movement, and lasts
for 4–72 h.
Occasionally, especially in older people, the aura
may occur without the headache –’migraine sine
cephalgia’. Migraine with aura is a risk factor for stroke.

Pathology
The mechanisms of migraine are not well understood.
Human studies provide evidence that migraine aura is
associated with a brief period of cortical hyperaemia
followed by a longer period of reduced blood flow. It
is thought that this is linked to ‘cortical spreading depression’, a slowly expanding wave of depolarization
followed by hyperpolarization. However, it is much
debated as to whether this is the cause of the headache
itself, which is thought to involve activation of trigeminal nerve afferents from the dura and vascular structures, and release of vasoactive neuropeptides.
The cerebral mechanism is responsive to mood, emotions, tiredness, relaxation, hormonal changes and
peripheral stimuli (e.g. bright lights and noise). There
is often a seasonal and/or diurnal pattern.

Management
Precipitating factors should be identified and avoided,
such as certain foods including cocoa, cheese, citrus
fruits and alcohol. Acute attacks should be treated as
early as possible with simple analgesia (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol), combined with an antiemetic
(e.g. domperidone or metoclopramide). Sometimes a
stronger analgesic such as codeine or morphine is
required.

293

Central nervous system
Sumatriptan and other 5HT 1b/1d agonists, which inhibit the release of vasoactive neuropeptides, are of value
in the treatment of acute attacks as proven in trials. They
can be given orally, intranasally or subcutaneously. They
should not be given to patients with ischaemic heart disease, coronary vasospasm or uncontrolled hypertension.
Ergotamine is used occasionally in patients who do
not respond to other treatments, but it may worsen nausea and vomiting. It also binds to 5-HT receptors. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain and muscular cramps, and it should not be used
for hemiplegic migraine or in patients with vascular, hepatic or renal disease. The frequency of administration
should be limited to no more than twice a month to
avoid habituation.

Prophylaxis
Prophylactic drugs are indicated in patients who have
two or more attacks each month, and include antihypertensives (especially beta-blockers), amitriptyline and
topiramate, as well as several other agents. The need for
continuing therapy should be reviewed every 6 months.

Cluster headache
Cluster headache is the most common of the trigeminal
autonomic cephalalgias, and is 10 times more common
in men than in women. Attacks usually start in adulthood. Headaches are unilateral and of agonizing severity around the eye or temple, and often occur at night.
Attacks last from 15 to 120 min, occur up to 8 times per
day, and continue for around 4 weeks to 3 months.
Total remission usually follows and lasts until the next
cluster a year or two later.
The pain may radiate to the face, jaw, neck and shoulder. Autonomic symptoms are prominent: the eye may
water and become red, the nostrils may run or feel
blocked, and there may be sweating. Miosis and ptosis
are common, and in some patients may persist permanently. Attacks can be precipitated by vasodilators, e.g.
alcohol, nitrites and calcium channel blockers.
Acute attacks can be aborted by high-flow oxygen.
Subcutaneous sumatriptan is also effective, and in some
patients intranasal lidocaine many resolve symptoms.
Verapamil, lithium, steroids or methysergide may be
used to prevent attacks.
Other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias include
paroxysmal hemicrania and the SUNCT syndrome,
which also have prominent autonomic features.

Tension-type headache
Tension-type headache is the most common type of primary headache, and may be episodic or chronic. It is
slightly more common in women. The classical

294

presentation is of intermittent attacks of diffuse tightness, pressure or heaviness over the vertex, or in the neck
or occiput, lasting from 30 min to 7 days. It may occasionally be unilateral. The headache may be relieved by
simple analgesia but is not accompanied by vomiting or
visual disturbance. Chronic tension-type headache may
evolve from the episodic form, and simple analgesia is
often of limited use when this occurs. The condition must
be distinguished from medication-overuse headache.
Enquiries should be made for the common and often
concealed fear of a brain tumour or stroke.

Idiopathic intracranial
hypertension
Also known as pseudotumour cerebri, this is not strictly
a headache syndrome but is an important cause of headache. The aetiology and pathogenesis is unknown but
many medications have been associated with the condition, notably tetracyclines and vitamin A. It occurs
mainly in overweight young women. Obesity is the only
established association; others, such as irregular menstruation and pregnancy, have not been reliably proven.
Common symptoms include headache, visual disturbance and pulsatile tinnitus. There is often marked
papilloedema, which, if long-standing, can lead to optic
atrophy and infarction of the optic nerve causing
blindness.
MRI is preferred to CT and may show flattened sclera
and an empty sella turcica. For the diagnosis to be made,
other causes of raised ICP must be absent. Lumbar
puncture shows raised CSF pressure but normal composition. Mainstays of treatment are weight loss, acetazolamide and diuretics; therapeutic lumbar punctures may
be needed in certain cases. In resistant cases, or if visual
acuity deteriorates, a ventriculoperitoneal CSF shunt
may be necessary.

Trigeminal neuralgia
There are many causes of facial pain, of which trigeminal neuralgia is one of the most common. This condition of unknown cause is seen most frequently in the
elderly and is more common in women. Although in
many patients the precise cause is never found, compression due to an aberrant blood vessel is thought to
account for the vast majority of cases. In young patients,
MS should be considered. It is unilateral in 96% of patients and consists of paroxysms of stabbing pain in the
distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal
nerve. The face may screw up with pain, hence the alternative name ’tic douloureux’. If motor or sensory deficits are present consider underlying structural disease
(e.g. atrioventricular malformation, cerebellopontine
angle tumour or MS).

Movement disorders
The pain may be brought on by touching a specific
trigger zone and is thus provoked by factors such as eating, shaving or talking. If left untreated, the condition
usually progresses, with shorter periods of remission.
Treatment is with carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine or gabapentin. Surgical procedures such as microvascular decompression or thermocoagulation of
the ganglion are reserved for when medical therapy fails.
Other neuralgias include glossopharyngeal neuralgia, precipitated by swallowing, and auriculotemporal
neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs in patients with
previous herpes zoster.

34

First described by James Parkinson in 1817, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is now known to be due to degeneration primarily affecting dopaminergic neurones in the
substantia nigra. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies (Lewy
bodies) are characteristic pathological features.
People with PD are less likely to be smokers. The incidence increases with age, with 1 in 100 people aged
over 60 years old affected. Most studies suggest a higher
incidence in men. PD is generally felt to be sporadic,
although there is increasing evidence of genetic factors
playing a role, especially in early-onset disease.
COMMUNICATION

Persistent idiopathic facial pain
(atypical facial pain)
This refers to episodes of prolonged facial pain for which
no cause can be found, and is therefore a diagnosis of exclusion. It is more common in women and may be preceded by facial surgery or injury. It is associated with
depression and may respond to tricyclic antidepressants.

It is essential to have an holistic approach to the care of
patients and their carers in chronic conditions such
as Parkinson’s disease. This hopefully culminates in the
formation of a supportive therapeutic alliance.

Clinical features
Early on the patient may complain of fatigue, muscular
discomfort or restlessness. Fine movements may be difficult. Onset is unilateral, becoming bilateral after
months or years, although severity may remain asymmetric for the duration of the disease.

MOVEMENT DISORDERS

Parkinsonism
Parkinsonism is a syndrome of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and later, postural instability; it has several
causes, of which Parkinson’s disease is just one. The differential diagnosis is detailed in Fig. 34.4. This section
will focus on idiopathic Parkinson’s disease.

Tremor
Initially, this is intermittent and may only appear when
the patient is tired. The frequency of the tremor is 3–6
beats per second and is most marked at rest (whereas

a cerebellar tremor is more marked on intention). There
is a ‘pill rolling’ movement of the thumb over the
fingers.

Rigidity
There is resistance to passive movement, which may be
smooth throughout its range (‘lead pipe’ rigidity).
When combined with tremor, resistance to passive
movement is jerky and is termed ‘cogwheel’ rigidity. It
is likely that rigidity contributes to the features of
stooped posture and reduced arm swing that are commonly seen (Fig. 34.5).

small (micrographia), spidery and cramped. Repeated
movements show slowing and reduced amplitude.
The face is expressionless and mask-like, the frequency
of spontaneous blinking reduces, and the voice is
monotonous and unmodulated. There is a shuffling,
‘festinant’ gait, and gait freezing may occur.

HINTS AND TIPS
To examine for bradykinesia, ask the patient to
unbutton and button their shirt.

Bradykinesia
Bradykinesia means difficulty in initiating movements.
Dexterity is often affected first, and it may be difficult
for the patient to rise from a chair. Writing becomes

Other features
Postural instability occurs late in the disease and results in
a significant risk of falls and serious injury. Disordered
swallowing causes saliva to gather and drip from the
half-open mouth. Autonomic dysfunction is common
and may cause constipation and urinary difficulties.
Rigidity may be accompanied by pain and sensory disturbance. Late in the disease, dementia may occur. Sleep
disorders and mood disorders such as depression are
frequently seen.

Differential diagnosis of parkinsonism
Fig. 34.4 describes different causes of parkinsonism.
Other conditions that may need to be considered are:
• Essential tremor: this is often straightforward to
distinguish but, in some cases, essential tremor can
continue at rest, and the tremor of PD may continue
on action.
• Other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s disease and frontotemporal dementia that
may have Parkinson-like features.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of PD is a clinical one. Laboratory investigations may help exclude metabolic causes if there is a
degree of suspicion. In difficult cases, SPECT scanning
with radioactive iodine (also called DaTSCAN) may help.

Management
The disease is treated symptomatically. Physiotherapy
can improve the gait and help build confidence. Physical aids such as high chairs and rails may help with daily
activities. Patient and carer information, education and
support are very important.

The aim of drug therapy is to correct the neurochemical
imbalance. This may greatly improve the quality of
life but does not prevent progression of the disease,

34

Movement disorders
and 10–20% of patients are unresponsive to treatment.
Much research is now aimed at developing neuroprotective agents, but none is yet used routinely.
Drugs may cause confusion in the elderly, and it is
important to start treatment with low doses and use
small increments. There are now a large number of potential pharmacological agents, and the choice of agent
has to be made carefully, taking into account individual
patient factors.

Levodopa (L-dopa)
L-dopa acts mainly by replenishing depleted striatal
dopamine. It helps bradykinesia and rigidity more than
tremor. It is generally administered with an extracerebral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. benserazide or
carbidopa). These prevent the peripheral breakdown
of L-dopa to dopamine but, unlike L-dopa, do not cross
the blood–brain barrier. Effective brain concentrations
of dopamine can thus be achieved with lower doses
of L-dopa.
The reduced peripheral formation of dopamine decreases peripheral side effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting
and cardiovascular effects). There is less delay in the onset of therapeutic effect and a smoother clinical response. However, there is an increased incidence of
abnormal involuntary movements.
L-dopa is the treatment of choice for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. It is less helpful for older patients or
those with long-standing disease who may not tolerate
the high doses required to overcome their deficit. Side
effects of L-dopa include nausea and vomiting, which
may be limited by domperidone. Late side effects include the sudden unpredictable swings of the ‘on–off’
syndrome, dyskinesia and ‘end-of-dose’ deterioration.
In the latter example, the duration of benefit after
each dose becomes progressively shorter. This may be
improved with modified-release preparations.
In view of the diminishing efficacy of L-dopa with
time it is worth delaying the start of drug therapy until
the disease is interfering with life, or starting another
agent first, thereby saving L-dopa for when symptoms
are more disabling. Clearly these decisions should be
made in conjunction with patients and carers.

Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors
Selegiline and rasagiline are the MAO-B inhibitors in
use. They inhibit the breakdown of dopamine and offer
modest symptoms control. They are licensed as a firstline therapy but are more often used as an adjunct.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors
These reduce the peripheral breakdown of L-dopa
and thus reduce the fluctuation in plasma levels and
prolong the benefit from each dose. Entacapone is an
example.

Anticholinergics
Examples include benzhexol and procyclidine. Tremor
and rigidity are improved more than akinesia. They are
best avoided in the elderly because of their side effects.

Amantadine
The mechanism of action of this drug is unclear. It
improves bradykinesia and rigidity more than tremor.
It may be helpful in the late stages of disease as an adjunct.

Other therapy
Surgery (deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus
or subthalamic nucleus) may help in cases with refractory motor complications, but only certain patients are
suitable. There is as yet no good evidence for the transplantation of dopaminergic neurones, nor for gene therapy or nerve factor infusion.

Tremor
Tremor is defined as a rhythmic oscillatory movement
of a body part, most commonly the hands, although
other body parts may be affected. It is a common complaint. The main causes are outlined below. In evaluating a tremor important points to consider are the
frequency and amplitude of the tremor, when it is present or most pronounced (at rest, on action or in fixed
posture), how disabling it is, and whether the patient
has symptoms or signs suggestive of a clear underlying
disorder. Differential diagnosis is summarized in
Fig. 34.6.

Dopamine agonists

Essential tremor

These act at the endogenous neuroreceptor. They may
be used as an adjunctive therapy after motor complications have arisen from the long-term use of L-dopa,
but may also be used as monotherapy before starting
L-dopa, especially in young patients.
The most common side effect of these agents is nausea due to stimulation of the area postrema in the medulla. This can be alleviated with domperidone. Drugs
in this group include bromocriptine, pergolide, ropinirole, rotigotine and apomorphine (which may be given
by continuous subcutaneous infusion).

This is probably the most common movement disorder.
Between cases the tremor is variable in frequency and
amplitude, but is usually high frequency, most commonly affecting the hands, although the head, trunk
or legs can also be affected. It is a postural tremor that
is maintained on movement and can be severely disabling. Classically it is alleviated by alcohol, but this
is an inadvisable treatment. A proportion of patients
will respond to beta-blockers. In severe intractable
cases, thalamotomy or deep brain stimulation is sometimes used.

Cerebellar disease
Midbrain lesions

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory, demyelinating disorder. It is the most common
cause of neurological disability in young adults in the
UK. The prevalence of MS varies worldwide and is
higher in white populations in temperate zones. The
overall prevalence in the UK is 1 in 1000, rising to as
high as 3 in 1000 in the Shetland and Orkney islands.
There is a female preponderance, with a female-to
male ratio of around 2:1. Genetic factors are thought
to account for 20–30% of the disease risk, and there
may be an association with a previous viral infection
such as with Epstein–Barr virus and reduced vitamin
D levels. Relapsing/remitting MS has an average onset
of 25–29 years, whereas the onset of primary progressive MS is around a decade later.

Pathogenesis
Parkinsonian tremor
This is described above.

Cerebellar tremor
This is classically a low-frequency intention tremor (severity increasing as the movement approaches its end point)
although it may be postural or movement related. It is
caused by lesions to the cerebellum or its outflow. Other
features of cerebellar disease may be present (see Ch. 26).

Huntington’s disease
This is an autosomal-dominant inherited disorder caused
by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding
huntingtin on chromosome 4. The mutation causes a
progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by
chorea (irregular, involuntary, ‘dance-like’ movement)
and dementia. It usually starts in middle age, although
earlier onset and more severe disease may be seen with
successive generations: this is termed ‘anticipation’.
Neuroleptics or tetrabenazine may help with chorea,
but there is no disease-modifying treatment.

Sydenham’s chorea
This occurs weeks to months after group A streptococcal
infection and is one of the features of acute rheumatic
fever. It is occasionally seen in children.

Other movement disorders
For a description of dystonias, tics, myoclonus and
akathisisa see Crash Course: Neurology.

298

The hallmark of MS is the presence of multiple lesions in
the central nervous system (not peripheral nerves) disseminated in location and time. Inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss all play a part in the pathogenesis of
MS, but the precise cause remains unknown and is the focus of much ongoing research. It is thought that the disease is started by self-reactive lymphocytes which invade
the CNS, causing blood–brain barrier disruption and
areas of inflammation and demyelination. Over time
and repeated insults, the microglia (resident macrophages
of the CNS) become permanently activated and axonal
loss occurs. However, the chronicity and contribution
of inflammatory and neurodegenerative components is
much debated. Sites of predilection include the optic
nerve, spinal cord, periventricular areas and brainstem.

Clinical features
The diagnosis depends on obtaining evidence of neurological lesions that have occurred at different sites at different times; this may be clinical or radiological. There is
a wide spectrum of disease activity and the course of
the disease is extremely variable. It is divided into the
following subtypes:
• Relapsing remitting MS is present in 85% of patients.
A small number of patients experience progression
between relapses (‘relapsing progressive’ MS)
• Secondary progressive MS: 50% of all relapsing/
remitting patients will enter a ‘secondary progressive’ phase within 10 years of diagnosis.
• In 15% the disease is progressive from the outset and
is termed primary progressive MS.
The onset is monosymptomatic in 85% of
patients. Common presentations include optic neuritis, symptoms referable to the brainstem and cerebellum (including diplopia and ataxia), or sensory
disturbance of the limbs and leg weakness.

34

Multiple sclerosis

Optic neuritis
This presents as unilateral eye pain (often exacerbated
by eye movement) and/or blurred vision, which may
progress over a few hours to days to variable visual loss.
Central vision is usually more severely affected, with
scotomata developing, but complete uniocular blindness may occur. The optic nerve head appears normal
unless the lesion is very anterior, when the disc may
be swollen. In 90% of patients vision improves over a
few months, but colour vision may be permanently affected. Transient blurring of vision lasting minutes, associated with exercise or raised body temperature may
occur (an example of Uhthoff’s phenomenon – worsening of symptoms with increased temperature). Following
an episode of optic neuritis, optic atrophy may ensue with
pallor of the disc on fundoscopic examination. Risk of MS
following optic neuritis depends on whether lesions are
present on MRI.

Diplopia
This is a common symptom caused by a brainstem lesion involving fibres of the 3rd, 4th or 6th cranial
nerves, or by a lesion in the medial longitudinal bundle
causing an internuclear ophthalmoplegia (see Ch. 2).

Sensory symptoms
These are a common presentation symptom and are
very variable depending on the tracts affected. They include paraesthesia and dysaesthesia (altered sensation),
diminished proprioception and vibration sense, and reduced pain and light touch sensation. The distribution
is also variable and may be limited to the extremities,
patchy over the limbs and trunk, or in an ‘evolving
sensory level’ pattern. Flexion of the neck may lead
to an electric shock sensation in the back and limbs
(Lhermitte’s sign), which is associated with a lesion in
the cervical cord.

Motor weakness
Lesions of the descending spinal tracts may cause weakness and spasticity in the limbs. The lower limbs are often more affected than the upper limbs. Upper motor
neurone signs are present. With an extensive transverse
myelitis, sensory and autonomic features may also be
present.

Cerebellar signs
Cerebellar signs include nystagmus, incoordination,
tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, titubation (continuous
rhythmical tremor of the head and trunk) and dysarthria.

HINTS AND TIPS
Cerebellar lesions lead to DASHING:
Dysdiadochokinesia, Ataxia, Speech abnormalities
(fluctuating, slurring), Hypotonic reflexes, Intention
tremor, Nystagmus, and Gait abnormalities.

Other manifestations
Other manifestations include the following:
• Cognitive impairment: especially of memory, sustained concentration and abstract conceptual reasoning.
• Psychiatric abnormalities: most commonly depression; about 10% of patients suffer psychotic symptoms; euphoria may be present in severely disabled
patients.
• Pain: this occurs in up to 50% of patients; trigeminal
neuralgia is 300 times more common in patients
with MS than in the general population.
• Paroxysmal symptoms: these include tonic seizures
and rapid flickering contraction in the facial muscles
(myokymia). Myokymia may frequently occur in
healthy people and is not necessarily pathological.
• Bladder and bowel disturbance: this occurs in 50–
75% of patients and is the presenting symptom in
10%; frequency, urgency, incontinence and constipation are the most frequent symptoms; sexual dysfunction is common.
• Uncommon manifestations: ‘useless hand’ syndrome (an upper limb ataxia), lower motor neurone
signs, swallowing and respiratory problems, and
extrapyramidal movement disorders.

Diagnosis and differential
diagnosis
The diagnosis of MS is based on clinical findings and the
exclusion of conditions producing a similar clinical picture. Fulfilment of the revised McDonald criteria (see
Further reading) is required after thorough assessment
of the patient. There must be evidence of lesions disseminated in space and time. MRI is used to support the
diagnosis (see below).
A single episode of disease consistent with MS is
termed ‘clinically isolated syndrome’. It may present
a diagnostic conundrum and compressive, inflammatory and mass or vascular lesions must be excluded.
Inflammatory conditions include primary angiitis of
the CNS, SLE, primary Sjögren’s syndrome, Behçet’s
disease and PAN, and in children acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis.
The differential diagnosis also includes infectious
diseases (e.g. Lyme disease, brucellosis, TB, HTLV-1associated myelopathy), multiple emboli and

299

Central nervous system
granulomatous disorders (e.g. sarcoidosis and Wegener’s
granulomatosis).
Neuromyelitis optica (previously Devic’s disease) involves extensive demyelination of the spinal cord and
optic nerve and is more common in African and Asian
populations.
Familial conditions that may present like MS include
adrenoleucodystrophy and CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy).

Investigations
The following investigations are important in the patient with MS:
• MRI is invaluable and shows lesions in the vast
majority of patients with clinically definite disease.
Gadolinium contrast shows areas of blood–brain
barrier disruption, and allows some discrimination
between old and new lesions.
• The CSF shows a lymphocytosis and moderately
raised protein. Oligoclonal bands of IgG isolated
to the CSF are seen in 90% of patients with clinically
definite MS but are not specific for MS.
• Delay in the visually evoked response follows optic
neuropathy, which may be subclinical. It is useful in
providing evidence of a second lesion in patients
whose neurological deficits are only attributable to
a single lesion. Delays may also occur in auditory
or somatosensory evoked potentials depending on
the site of the lesions.
• Antibodies to myelin proteins may be present but
are of no diagnostic use. Antibodies to aquaporin4 are 98% specific for neuromyelitis optica.

Prognosis
The progression of MS is very variable and depends on
the pattern of disease. Relapsing/remitting disease has a
better prognosis. After 5 years, 70% of patients are still
employed. After 20 years, only 35% are employed, and
20% are dead from complications. A few patients have
‘benign MS’ characterized by long periods of remission,
infrequent relapses and no functional disability at 15
years’ post-diagnosis.

Management
Treatment of MS has two aims: symptom management
and disease modification. Pulses of IV methylprednisolone effectively shorten acute relapses but do not alter
the course of the disease and should be used sparingly
to limit side effects.
Symptomatic treatment is of great importance. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy maintain maximum function. Spasticity may respond to baclofen,

300

dantrolene or vigabatrin. The intention tremor resulting
from the involvement of the cerebellum may respond to
isoniazid and pyridoxine, or to beta-blockers. Trigeminal neuralgia and paroxysmal symptoms may respond
to carbamazepine, and chronic dysaesthetic pain may
respond to tricyclic antidepressants.
The management of patients with bladder disturbance has been revolutionized by the introduction of
clean intermittent self-catheterization. Anticholinergic
agents, particularly oxybutynin, may alleviate urinary
frequency. In men with erectile dysfunction, sildenafil
or intracorporeal papaverine may be helpful.
Several disease-modifying agents have shown promise in reducing the frequency of relapses and lesions on
MRI. However, whether this translates into a reduction
in the accumulation of disability and a delay in disease
progression is unclear. Beta-interferon and glatiramer
acetate remain first-line therapy for relapsing/remitting
disease. Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed
against alpha-4 integrin, is reserved for patients with
highly active disease due to the risk of progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Mitoxantrone is occasionally used for patients who have failed other therapies. Fingolimod has been approved for use in the USA
but remains under review in the UK. Several other
agents are being assessed in clinical trials.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
INFECTION

Meningitis
Meningitis is inflammation of the membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord. It may be caused by
the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Infection: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
Malignant cells.
Blood following SAH.
Inflammatory conditions: sarcoid, lupus, vasculitis.
Air, drugs or contrast media during encephalography.

The term ‘meningitis’ is usually reserved for infection of
the meninges by organisms. This section will focus on
bacterial meningitis.

Causative organisms
This is likely to vary with the patient’s age:
• In neonates: Escherichia coli and group B streptococci
are common.
• In children: meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis)
predominate and Streptococcus pneumoniae are common. Haemophilus influenzae is a less common cause
since vaccination was introduced.

Central nervous system infection
• Young adults: prone to meningococcus.
• Older adults: prone to pneumococcus (S. pneumoniae).
• Immunocompromised patients and the elderly:
prone to pneumococcus, Listeria, Gram-negative
organisms and Cryptococcus.

Predisposing factors
Outbreaks of meningitis tend to occur with overcrowding, poverty and malnutrition. Infection may spread
in institutions such as prisons or universities. Secondary meningitis can occur after head injury, sinusitis,
mastoiditis or extension of infection from the ears
and nasopharynx. Immunocompromised patients such
as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS), with carcinoma, on cytotoxic drugs and following splenectomy are at increased risk. People with congenital meningeal defects or CSF shunts are also prone
to infection.

Clinical features

34

a variable mild pyrexia. These symptoms may persist
for days but gradually an unremitting deterioration occurs. There may be personality changes and intermittent
dulling of consciousness before signs of meningism are
obvious. The appearance of focal neurological signs suggests a complication (e.g. venous sinus thrombosis,
cerebral oedema or hydrocephalus).

Differential diagnosis
Any cause of headache (Ch. 18) or infection should be
considered. Of particular note are severe migraine, acute
encephalitis and SAH. Unusual organisms should be
considered in the setting of immune compromise.

Investigations
HINTS AND TIPS
DO NOT delay therapy in favour of completing
investigations in suspected meningitis.

Meningism
The features of meningism are headache and neck stiffness. Kernig’s sign (Fig. 34.7) (i.e. pain on passively
extending the knee with the hips fully flexed) or Brudzinski’s signs may be positive.

Sepsis
High fever is typical. The patient may describe malaise
and arthralgia. Any rash may occur, although a petechial/purpuric rash is strongly suggestive of meningococcal disease. Rigors, tachycardia and hypotension
may occur.

Raised intracranial pressure
Headache, vomiting, reduced consciousness and seizures may all occur. Later, bradycardia and hypertension can occur (Cushing’s reflex).
In tuberculous meningitis, symptoms may initially
be non-specific with malaise, anorexia, headache and

Blood should be taken for FBC, urea and electrolytes
(U&Es), CRP, glucose and culture. Blood cultures, throat
swabs and a stool sample for viruses should be taken.
Lumbar puncture is the key investigation and should
be performed as soon as possible. If the patient is profoundly ill, IV antibiotics should be given first. A CT scan
should be performed first if there is any evidence of raised
intracranial pressure: reduced consciousness, seizures,
focal neurology, papilloedema. Samples should be sent
for microscopy and culture, Gram stain, protein estimation, glucose (with simultaneous plasma glucose) and
virology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis
of meningococcus infection should be performed on
peripheral blood. PCR for individual organisms can also
be performed on CSF. CSF changes in meningitis are
summarized in Fig. 34.8 (see also Ch. 26).

Treatment

Fig. 34.7 Eliciting Kernig’s sign.

High doses of appropriate antibiotics should be given as
soon as possible. If a lumbar puncture can be performed
quickly it may be possible to obtain a sample of CSF
first, but this should not delay the administration of
antibiotics.
If outside a hospital, give 1.2 g IM of benzylpenicillin. Therapy in hospital is usually empirical initially
(consult local policy) (e.g. IV ceftriaxone for patients
<50 years and IV ceftriaxone and amoxicillin (to cover
Listeria) in patients >50 years). Aciclovir IV should also
be given if encephalitis is suspected (see below). These
treatments may subsequently be modified depending
on the results of microbiological analysis.

Analgesia and careful monitoring of the patient’s
haemodynamic status and urine output are important.
If the patient is septicaemic involve the Intensive Care
Unit early. If meningitic signs predominate the clinical
picture give IV dexamethasone before, or at the same
time as, antibiotics. This can reduce the risk of long-term
neurological sequelae and mortality in pneumococcal
meningitis. It is also indicated in tuberculous meningitis. It should be avoided in septic shock, known meningococcal disease and immunocompromised states.
Always remember that meningitis is a notifiable disease and cases must be reported to the Department of
Health. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for
close contacts of the index case.

Encephalitis
This is inflammation of the brain parenchyma. There is
usually some inflammation of the meninges in encephalitis and conversely some inflammation of the parenchyma in meningitis.
Encephalitis can be caused by viruses (most commonly herpes simplex – HSV), Listeria and Toxoplasma
if immunocompromised, tuberculosis, and by bacteria
where there may be associated abscess formation.
The patient may present with altered mental state,
reduced consciousness, seizures, headache or focal neurology. Features of meningism will be present in combined meningoencephalitis. A high index of suspicion
is required.
The diagnosis depends on knowledge of local epidemics, unreliable radiological features (such as temporal
lobe swelling in HSV encephalitis) and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings (periodic complexes in HSV encephalitis), CSF findings (see Ch. 26), and demonstration of
viruses in the CSF by serology or PCR. Often, the diagnosis is not confirmed. The differential diagnosis is wide and
includes paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis as
well as any cause of encephalopathy.
HSV encephalitis is potentially treatable and therefore if there is any suspicion of encephalitis IV aciclovir
should be given (in addition to other empirical treatments for meningoencephalitis) and the CSF should
be sent for HSV PCR.

CNS abscess
This can occur via direct spread, for instance from mastoiditis or sinusitis, or from a distant region, most commonly a
site of chronic infection such as subacute bacterial endocarditis or chronic suppurative lung disease. Haematogenous spread often leads to multiple abscesses. There is a
wide range of possible causative organisms, particularly
in the patient with immune compromise, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as fungi.
Presentation with headache is most common,
although features of meningitis or encephalitis may be
present depending on the extent of the inflammation.
In large, rapidly expanding abscesses, signs of raised
ICP may be present. MRI or CT scan with contrast will
show a ring-enhancing lesion (for differential diagnosis
see Fig. 34.9). Treatment will require an extended course
of IV antibiotics, the choice of which depends on the
suspected source and therefore identity of the organism.
Surgical aspiration may be required.

Spinal cord infection
This includes epidural abscesses, viral myelitis and
tuberculous myelopathy.

EPILEPSY
Epilepsy refers to a group of conditions in which paroxysms of abnormal electrical activity of cerebral neurons
result in seizures. A single acute seizure has many
possible provoking factors (see Aetiology); a person is

34

Epilepsy
considered to have epilepsy if the seizures recur over
time. As many as 1 in 20 of the general population have
a seizure at some time in their lives and around 200 000
people in the UK are taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
In understanding the classification of epileptic disorders, the distinction between seizures and syndromes
must be understood; a patient with a epilepsy syndrome
may experience several different types of seizure.

initial partial seizure. The seizure has a sudden onset
with sudden loss of consciousness, followed by a tonic
phase involving powerful muscular contractions. Teeth
are clenched; cyanosis may occur. After about a minute,
the clonic phase starts, consisting of convulsive movements – jerking/twitching – as the muscles intermittently relax before clenching again. The patient is
often drowsy and confused following the event (postictal confusion).

Classification
The International League against Epilepsy reviewed the
classification in 2010, reclassifying the aetiology (previously idopathic, symptomatic or cryptogenic) as ‘genetic,
structural/metabolic, or unknown’. Seizures were previously classified as generalized, simple partial (not affecting
consciousness) or complex partial (affecting consciousness), with or without secondary generalization. The
new classification advised that with regard to focal seizures, the distinction between ‘complex’ and ‘simple’
should be dropped. However, these terms, and the term
‘idiopathic generalized epilepsy’ remain widely used.
There may be a prodrome lasting hours to days before a
seizure, where there is a change in mood or behaviour.
This is not part of the seizure, unlike an aura (see below).
Some common syndromes are outlined in Fig. 34.10.

Generalized seizures
These are not referable to a single hemisphere.

Tonic–clonic (grand mal) seizures
Prior to the seizure, the patient may experience a prodrome with symptoms such as mood change, irritability
and anxiety. There is no aura, which would represent an

HINTS AND TIPS
Faecal (as opposed to urinary) incontinence and biting
at the side of the tongue (as opposed to the tip) are
helpful pointers towards the diagnosis of a seizure.

Absence attacks (petit mal)
These often start in childhood. There are brief interruptions of consciousness, sometimes accompanied by
rhythmical blinking of the eyelids. To an observer, the
child may appear to be dazed or daydreaming. Recovery
is immediate and there are no sequelae.

Myoclonic epilepsy
This is a form of idiopathic epilepsy developing in early
childhood. Various types of generalized fit occur, including sudden jerking movements of the limbs (myoclonus). The patient often remains conscious and alert
throughout.

Atonic or akinetic epilepsy
During the attack the patient becomes flaccid and falls
to the ground.

Central nervous system

Focal (partial) seizures
The features of partial seizures can be referred to a single
hemisphere and are therefore suggestive of underlying
structural problems. The nature of the attack varies
according to the primary site of the lesion.

Without impairment of consciousness (simple
partial seizures)
Consciousness is unimpaired and these attacks are characterized by focal activity related to the site of abnormal
electrical activity. This may be motor, sensory (including special senses), autonomic (e.g. sweating) or affecting higher consciousness. In motor seizures, the affected
limb may suffer a short-lived weakness after the attack
(Todd’s paresis).

With impairment of consciousness (complex partial
seizures)
These seizures are often derived from the temporal
lobes. Hippocampal sclerosis may be present. An aura
precedes the loss of consciousness in the majority of
cases, and may consist of hallucinations of any of the
five senses or of higher function (e.g. memory). Abdominal aura, a ‘rising’ feeling in the upper abdomen, is
common. Gustatory and olfactory hallucinations are
usually unpleasant. ‘Jamais vu’ is a sudden feeling of unfamiliarity while the patient is in their own environment and ‘déjà vu’ is a vivid sense of familiarity with
the current situation.
When consciousness is lost, the patient may still
appear awake, and automatisms may occur: semipurposeful, stereotyped, repetitive movements such as
lip smacking or picking at clothing. An abnormal posture may be adopted due to dystonia. The patient cannot remember these events after the attack.

Focal seizure evolving to generalized seizure
The seizure starts off with focal involvement but then
spreads widely, causing a generalized seizure.
COMMUNICATION
Take time to discuss and explain this condition to
patients. They will often feel stigmatized by the
diagnosis and their concerns and worries need to be
addressed.

Aetiology
The majority of seizures are ‘idiopathic’ although it is increasingly understood that genetic disorders underlie a
significant number of these syndromes. Structural
causes, such as congenital malformations or acquired lesions, are also common causes. When a patient presents

304

with a first seizure, provoking factors must be sought.
These include the following:
• Metabolic causes: hypoxia, hyper- or hypoglycaemia,
hypocalcaemia, uraemia, alcoholism, hypo- and
hypernatraemia, liver failure, pyridoxine deficiency.
• Drugs and toxins: alcohol, lead, both prescription
and recreational drugs (e.g. phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants,
amphetamines, lidocaine, nalidixic acid). Acute
withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines is associated with seizures.
• Trauma and surgery (e.g. perinatal trauma or head
injury).
• Space-occupying lesions: e.g. tumour, abscess, extraaxial haemorrhage.
• Cerebral infarction.
• Other organic brain diseases: SLE, PAN, sarcoidosis,
vascular malformations.
• Infections: encephalitis, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus.
• Degenerative brain disorders: Alzheimer’s disease,
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

HINTS AND TIPS
Reflex anoxic seizures following a faint are common,
especially if the patient remains in an upright posture.

Precipitants of seizures
In a patient with epilepsy, seizures may be triggered by
flashing lights, exercise, strong emotions and hyperventilation (leading to alkalosis). Other conditions that
may precipitate seizures by lowering the seizure threshold include fever, irregular meals, menstruation, lack of
sleep and pregnancy. Certain medications also lower
the seizure threshold.

Differential diagnosis
Seizures can be difficult to distinguish from other causes
of collapse. This is discussed in Ch. 22. Non-epileptic
attack disorder (psychogenic seizures or pseudoseizures) can be very difficult to distinguish from true
epilepsy.

Investigations
NICE guidelines propose that all patients with a recent-onset suspected seizure are seen urgently by a
specialist to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate
therapy.

Epilepsy

General tests
The diagnosis is a clinical one and a good witness account of the ‘seizures’ is vital. After a thorough history
and examination to consider differential diagnoses,
blood tests should be performed including FBC,
U&Es, serum calcium and magnesium, liver function
tests and glucose. An ABG taken during or just after
the seizure will often show a metabolic acidosis, which
will normalize rapidly after cessation of the seizure.
It may be necessary to screen blood and urine for
drugs/toxins. A CXR and ECG should be performed.

Imaging
A CT scan may be useful in the acute setting to look for
large lesions. However, MRI is the modality of choice
and may uncover subtle structural abnormalities. It is
especially important when epilepsy develops in adulthood or in the very young (under 2 years old), and
for focal seizures. It is not always necessary when there
is a clear diagnosis of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy
syndrome.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)
The diagnosis should not be based solely on the EEG, as
10–15% of the general population may have an ‘abnormal’ EEG and approximately 15% of people with
epilepsy never have specific epileptiform discharges.
However, it may help further identify the type of epilepsy.

Treatment
Treatment is recommended after two seizures, but may
be started after a single unprovoked seizure in certain
circumstances – if EEG or imaging is conclusive, or if
the risk of a further seizure is considered too great.
The aims of drug treatment are to prevent seizures while
keeping the patient free of side effects. Antiepileptic
drugs should be prescribed individually, using the
lowest dose to obtain complete seizure control
with minimum side effects. A single drug will suffice
in approximately 80% of patients, the remainder needing a second drug to achieve acceptable control. Partial
epilepsy is more likely to be refractory.
Having chosen a drug, the dose is gradually increased
until control is achieved, the maximum dose is reached
or toxic effects supervene. In the latter two cases, alternatives need to be considered (see below).
Carbamazepine, phenytoin and barbiturates all induce hepatic enzymes and therefore speed up the metabolism of oestrogens and progestogens, making the
oral contraceptive pill unreliable. Sodium valproate
does not affect oral contraceptive efficacy, but carries
a significant risk of teratogenicity.

34

Treatment is first instituted according to the specific
epilepsy syndrome; if this is not clear, it is started
according to the seizure type.

First-line drugs
Generalized seizures
The type of seizure must be carefully assessed. Sodium
valproate is recommended as the first-line treatment
of choice for tonic–clonic seizures or for myoclonic seizures. Lamotrigine may also be used for tonic–clonic
seizures, but can worsen myoclonic seizures. Carbamazepine is ineffective for the treatment of absence or myoclonic seizures, but is effective for tonic–clonic seizures.
Common unwanted effects of sodium valproate include
weight gain, hair thinning and tremor.

Focal seizures
Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are the first-line therapies. Levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine or sodium valproate
may also be used. Carbamazepine may cause CNS side
effects (e.g. dizziness, nausea, headaches and drowsiness), which may be avoided by slowly increasing the
dose. It induces hepatic enzymes and so increases the
metabolism of hepatically metabolized drugs.It may increase or decrease serum phenytoin levels depending on
the individual

Second-line drugs
Phenytoin is useful but less commonly used because of
its unpredictable pharmacokinetics. NICE suggests that
the newer AEDs (e.g. lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, vigabatrin) be used as second-line
agents if valproate and carbamazepine are contraindicated or ineffective.

Changing drugs
This may be performed in cases of treatment failure or
because of side effects. The new drug is commenced at
its starting dose and gradually increased. The old drug
is withdrawn slowly.

Withdrawing drugs
Most patients are seizure-free within a few years of starting therapy and 60% remain so after drug withdrawal.
Therefore drug withdrawal is considered in some
patients after a period of therapy if they have been
seizure-free for two years or more. Certain factors
increase the risk of seizure recurrence, such as abnormal
EEG, abnormalities on neurological exam, or some
types of epilepsy (e.g. juvenile myoclonic epilepsy).
Therefore the risks need to be assessed on an individual
basis and carefully explained.

305

Central nervous system

The role of surgery
Surgery is sometimes needed for refractory, drug resistant epilepsy. It is most effective for focal seizures when
the focus of the abnormal electrical activity can be accurately localized and resected.

Ketogenic diet
The use of this high fat, moderate protein, low carbohydrate diet should be considered in children and young
adults when seizure control is difficult.

Epilepsy and other issues
Pregnancy
There are several important issues to be considered
when an epileptic patient wants to become, or becomes,
pregnant. It is important to enlist specialist help in this
situation.
• The effect of AEDs on the fetus: several AEDs,
including carbamazepine and valproate, are teratogenic. Are the drugs necessary?
• The effect of pregnancy on the mother’s seizures and
the risk to the fetus from maternal seizures.
It is imperative to counsel the patient regarding these issues so that informed choices can be made. If it is felt
that antiepileptic therapy must continue during pregnancy it is important to try to use a single agent at the
lowest possible dose.

Driving and work
Current regulations stipulate that after a single unprovoked seizure, the patient must not drive for 6 months.
If a diagnosis of epilepsy is made, the patient must be
seizure-free for at least one year before driving can be
recommenced. Longer periods are necessary for drivers
of large commercial vehicles. When a seizure at work
would pose a significant risk to the patient or his colleagues, this needs to be carefully discussed.

Convulsive status epilepticus
This is a medical emergency and is defined as prolonged
generalized tonic–clonic seizures lasting more than
5 min, or repeated seizures without intervening recovery
of consciousness. Both the risk of permanent brain damage and mortality are related to the length of the attack and
therefore seizures must be stopped as soon as possible.
Check bedside glucose levels. Once therapy has been
instigated, the following tests should be performed: arterial blood gas, electrolytes, serum calcium, ECG, FBC.
Consider checking anticonvulsant levels if appropriate,
toxicology screen, lumbar puncture and blood/urine
cultures, CT scan.

306

• Priority is basic life support and ABC (Airway,
Breathing, Circulation).
• Lay the patient in the recovery position, remove false
teeth and insert an oral airway. The patient may
require intubation.
• Administer high-flow oxygen and suction.
• Check capillary glucose.
• Gain IV access and take blood for FBC, lab glucose,
U&Es, liver function tests, calcium, toxicology screen
and drug levels if on anticonvulsant. A blood gas is
useful.
• Give a bolus of 20% or 50% dextrose if any suggestion of hypoglycaemia.
• Give slow IV bolus of lorazepam 4 mg (IV diazepam
or buccal midazolam are alternatives).
• If seizures persist, commence a phenytoin infusion
(with cardiac monitor) or a diazepam infusion.
• If seizures still persist, consider paralysis, ventilation
and an urgent EEG.
Post-seizure, consider further investigations: brain scan,
ECG, lumbar puncture.

Sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP)
Patients with epilepsy are at higher risk of sudden death,
termed SUDEP. Certain features, which are mainly
relate to the severity of the epilepsy, place patients at
higher risk, such as seizure frequency and duration of
disease. Patients should be informed and counselled
regarding this issue.

INTRACRANIAL TUMOURS
Primary intracerebral tumours account for around 2%
of all cancers. Due to their location and threat to health,
even if ’benign’, they are often classified as high-grade or
low-grade tumours rather than benign or malignant.
Certain familial conditions, such as neurofibromatosis,
predispose to development of brain tumours. Secondary intracerebral tumours (metastases) are more common and occur in up to 30% of cancers, mainly from
the bronchus, breasts, kidneys, colon, ovary, prostate
or thyroid. The main sites of origin of brain tumours
are shown in Fig. 34.11.

Clinical features
Symptoms arise from the direct effects of the mass on
surrounding structures, from the effects of raised intracranial pressure or by provoking seizures. Similar
symptoms may be produced by any mass lesion
(e.g. haematomas, aneurysms, abscesses, tuberculomas,
granulomas and cysts).

tumour; this is particularly useful in planning surgery.
If metastases are suspected, investigations for the primary neoplasm should be carried out. If a primary
intracranial tumour is suspected, stereotactic biopsy
is required for definitive diagnosis of type and grade
of tumour. It will also rule out other causes, such as abscess or inflammatory lesions, which may be difficult
to differentiate on imaging.

Initial management is of the complications: dexamethasone for cerebral oedema and anticonvulsants for seizures. Emergency surgery such as shunt insertion may
be required to adequately decompress the brain.
Further treatment depends on type and grade of tumour, and estimates of risk and benefit are often difficult.
Surgical resection is preferred if possible. Radiotherapy is
usually recommended for gliomas and for radiosensitive
metastases. Adjuvant chemotherapy may provide a small
but significant survival benefit.
A watch-and-wait policy is sometimes adopted for
small, indolent tumours such as low-grade meningiomas.

Direct effects depend on the site of the tumour:
• Frontal lobe: personality changes, apathy and
impairment of intellectual function. There may be
anosmia, contralateral hemiparesis or dysphasia
(Broca’s area).
• Parietal lobe: contralateral homonymous field
defects and hemisensory loss. There may be apraxia,
spatial disorientation and dysphasia if the temporoparietal region is affected. Signs include ‘parietal
drift’ or falling of the outstretched contralateral
arm, astereognosis (inability to recognize an object
placed in the hand) and sensory inattention.
• Temporal lobe: problems with memory, comprehension, emotion. Contralateral superior visual field
defects.
• Occipital lobe: contralateral hemianopia.
• Cerebellopontine angle: vertigo and progressive ipsilateral perceptive deafness (8th nerve), numbness of
the ipsilateral side of the face (5th nerve), facial weakness (7th nerve) and ipsilateral cerebellar signs.

Raised intracranial pressure
Symptoms include headache (worse in the morning and
with stooping, coughing and sneezing), vomiting (possibly without nausea) and papilloedema. Displacement of
intracranial contents may cause focal signs similar to
direct mass effects or general effects due to herniation;
as this occurs there will be impairment of consciousness
progressing to coma and respiratory depression. ‘False localizing signs’ may be present (e.g. a 6th nerve lesion, as it
is compressed against the petrous temporal bone).

Investigations
Cross-sectional imaging is the first investigation; plain
X-rays are of limited use. MRI provides more detailed
images than CT. More advanced techniques such as
PET, SPECT or MR spectroscopy may provide additional information about the extent and grade of

COMMUNICATION
The multidisciplinary team meeting is extremely
important in the management of brain tumours and
provides a forum where investigations can be
reviewed, and all aspects of care can be discussed.

Prognosis
The overall 1-year survival for patients with primary
intracerebral tumours is less than 50%.
There may be complete recovery from meningiomas
if they are removed completely.

DISORDERS AFFECTING MUSCLE
AND THE NEUROMUSCULAR
JUNCTION

Muscle disorders
For more on muscle disorders, see polymyositis and dermatomyositis in Ch. 36.

Myotonic dystrophy (myotonia
dystrophica)
This is an autosomal dominant condition characterized
by myotonia: the inability of the muscles to relax normally after contraction. The peak onset is between the

307

Central nervous system
ages of 20 and 30 years, and the incidence in the UK is
approximately 5 in 100 000. There is muscle wasting
and weakness of the facial muscles with ptosis, a wry
smile or ‘sneer’ and a ‘hang-dog’ expression due to the
thin face and lax jaw muscles. The neck and distal limb
muscles are also affected.
Other associated features include frontal baldness,
cataracts, testicular or ovarian atrophy, cardiomyopathy
with conduction disturbances, mental impairment and
endocrine dysfunction including diabetes. Reflexes are
lost. The myotonia is often revealed by shaking the
patient’s hand (slow to release grip) or by asking
patients to repetitively open and close their eyes or fists.
It may be elicited by percussing the thenar eminence –
the induced depression is slow to fill (‘percussion
myotonia’). It increases with fatigue, cold and stress.
Diagnosis is by genetic testing. The myotonia may
improve with procainamide or phenytoin.

Muscular dystrophies (MD)
These are a group of genetically determined diseases
characterized by progressive degeneration and weakness
of certain muscle groups.

Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies
(pseudohypertrophic)
These are the commonest types and are X-linked recessive. Both involve mutations of the dystrophin
gene. The incidence is around 2 in 10 000 male births.
Duchenne MD presents at around 5 years of age with
clumsiness in walking and difficulty climbing stairs.
Examination reveals a lordotic posture and ‘waddling’
gait due to proximal muscle weakness. The calves are
hypertrophied. When rising from the floor, patients
may need to use their hands to bring themselves into
an upright position (Gower’s sign). Investigations show
a markedly raised creatine kinase concentration. Electromyography and muscle biopsy show characteristic
changes. Cardiomyopathy is common. Death usually occurs before the age of 20 years from intercurrent illnesses
(e.g. chest infection). There is no specific treatment.
Becker MD is less severe, with onset usually in the teenage
years and survival usually beyond the third decade.

Fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy
(Landouzy–Dejerine syndrome)
This is autosomal dominant. The onset is around puberty
with wasting and weakness of the upper limb girdle and
face. Life expectancy is usually normal.

Limb girdle dystrophy
This describes a group of disorders affecting predominantly proximal muscles. Most are autosomal recessive,
and onset is frequently in childhood in the most common types. The condition is progressive, with death in
middle age. There may be cardiac involvement.

308

Neuromuscular junction disorders
Myasthenia gravis
This is an autoimmune disease where muscle weakness
is caused by a reduction in the number of functional
postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors, and their eventual
destruction. Approximately 90% of patients have detectable levels of antibody to the postsynaptic acetylcholine
receptor. Most of the remainder have antibodies to
muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). It is associated with thymoma and thymus hyperplasia, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE.

Clinical features
In younger patients (<50 years) it is more common
in females and associated with other autoimmune
conditions. In older patients there is a male preponderance and an association with thymic atrophy/tumour.
There is painless muscle weakness, which worsens on repetitive contraction and fluctuates over the day. Over
half of patients present with extraocular muscle weakness causing ptosis and diplopia. The facial and bulbar
muscles are commonly affected, causing the ’myasthenic snarl’ on smiling, dysarthria and dysphagia.
Proximal muscles and upper limbs are more often affected than distal muscles and lower limbs. Reflexes
are usually normal. In 15%, the disease remains limited
to the eyes. Myasthenic crisis is a rare complication with
rapidly worsening weakness often precipitated by infection or medication. Respiratory weakness is the concern, and the patient may require intubation and
ventilation.

Investigations
Edrophonium 10 mg can be given intravenously (with
cardiac monitoring and resuscitation facilities), and in
a positive test improves muscle power for 3–4 min. It
enhances neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia
gravis by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and thereby
prolonging the action of acetylcholine. It is a sensitive
test but has a high false-positive rate.
The mainstays of laboratory diagnosis are serological
testing for anti-acetylcholine receptor and anti-MuSK
antibodies, as well as electromyography which reveals
a decremental muscle response to repetitive nerve stimulation. A CT scan of the thymus is performed.

Management
Symptomatic control is with a longer-acting anticholinesterase (e.g. pyridostigmine or neostigmine). The dose
is slowly titrated against muscle power. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, diarrhoea
and abdominal cramps. Cholinergic crisis can occur and
is similar in presentation to myasthenic crisis.
Immunosuppression with prednisolone on alternate
days may achieve remission. If there is no remission and

Disorders of the peripheral nerves
weakness is severe, azathioprine may be helpful. In intractable cases, plasmapheresis gives approximately 4
weeks of benefit. The condition is usually relapsing or
slowly progressive, and respiratory muscle involvement
can lead to death. The 5-year survival with a thymoma is
approximately 70%. Resection of the thymus may
increase the likelihood of achieving remission.

Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome
This is an autoimmune condition but may be paraneoplastic; around 50% of cases are associated with small-cell
lung cancer. Antibodies to the presynaptic voltage-gated
calcium channels are present. The resulting weakness diminishes with exertion (opposite of myasthenia). Slowly
progressive weakness is typical, particularly affecting the
lower limbs. Autonomic involvement and hyporeflexia
are characteristic. Therapy with IV immunoglobulin,
plasmapharesis or 3,4-diaminopyridine is supervised
by experts. Regular chest X-rays are important; the neurological symptoms may predate cancer detection by
months or even years

DISORDERS OF THE PERIPHERAL
NERVES

Peripheral neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy is a general term referring to
disorders of peripheral nerves; the presentation can be
divided into mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex
and polyneuropathy. The causes of these are summarized in Ch. 26. The four most common causes are diabetes mellitus, malignancy, vitamin B12 deficiency, and
drugs (notably alcohol). Treatment is aimed at the
underlying cause. Some specific peripheral nerve syndromes are considered here.

Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS)
This is an acute immune-mediated condition with several subtypes, the most common of which in Caucasians
is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
(AIDP). It affects motor nerves more than sensory
nerves and occurs days or weeks after an infectious
illness such as Campylobacter sp., cytomegalovirus or
Epstein–Barr virus. Clinically there is progressive, relatively symmetrical weakness starting in the legs in 90%
of patients and often accompanied by paraesthesia and
numbness. The upper limbs, trunk, respiratory and
cranial nerves may then become affected. In 10% the
weakness starts in the arms or facial muscles, and in
the Miller Fisher subtype there is ophthalmoplegia and
ataxia. Complications of GBS include respiratory failure,

34

cardiac arrhythmias due to autonomic dysfunction and
aspiration due to bulbar palsy. Due to immobility the
patients are at high risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
and pulmonary embolism.
Most patients with GBS start to improve within a
month. A small proportion of patients will continue
to progress or suffer relapses; if this continues for more
than 8 weeks the illness is termed chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).

Investigations
The CSF shows a high protein concentration (up to
10 g/L) with a normal cell count. Nerve conduction
studies confirm slowing of conduction. The vital capacity should be measured 4–6-hourly to anticipate
respiratory depression. In addition, the patient’s swallowing should be monitored closely as should the
postural drop in blood pressure (as an indicator of
autonomic function).

Management
Supportive
Attention should be paid to fluid balance and nutrition,
and prevention of pressure sores, DVT and pneumonia
(with physiotherapy). Mechanical ventilation may be
necessary if respiratory failure occurs.

Specific
Steroids are not of benefit. However, IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange have been shown to improve
outcome, and are recommended for patients presenting
up to 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms.
Around 5% of severely affected patients will die in intensive care. Around 90% of all patients with GBS make
a good recovery.

Entrapment/compression
neuropathies
These are extremely common syndromes causing
mononeuropathy with neurological symptoms and
signs in the distribution of a single peripheral nerve.
The injury to the nerve may be transient, changing with
position, but with chronicity demyelination and axonal
degeneration may occur. Some of the most frequently
encountered conditions are described here:
• Carpal tunnel syndrome: compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel at
the wrist, causing numbness, paraesthesiae and
weakness of the hand.
• Radial nerve palsy: compression of the radial nerve,
frequently at the spiral groove in the upper arm,
causing weakness of wrist and finger extensors, with
numbness of the dorsum of the hand and forearm
(’Saturday night palsy’).

309

Central nervous system
• Meralgia paraesthetica: entrapment of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh as it passes under the inguinal ligament, causing numbness over the lateral
aspect of the thigh.

DISORDERS OF THE SPINAL
CORD
Spinal cord compression
Spinal cord compression is a medical emergency. Causes
are summarized in Fig. 34.12. Symptoms include local
or radicular pain, often precipitated by movement or
straining, spastic paraparesis with upper motor neurone
signs below the level of the lesion and lower motor neurone signs at the level of the lesion, sensory loss with a
characteristic ‘sensory level’, and sphincter disturbances
at a later stage. It is important to note that there is a discrepancy between the level of the root lesion and that
of the sensory level and spastic paraparesis. This arises because the spinal cord is shorter than the spinal column
(it ends at the second lumbar vertebra in the adult)
and below the cervical spine the nerve roots travel inferiorly before exiting through the vertebral foramina. For
instance, a lesion at the level of the T10 cord segment
may be at the T9 vertebra level and hence cause T9 root
symptoms but a T10 sensory level. Compression of the
cauda equina (the descending lumbar and sacral nerve
roots below the level of the L2 vertebra) causes root pain
and lower motor neurone pattern weakness in the legs,
with saddle anaesthesia (numbness of buttocks and perineum) and sphincter disturbances. If suspected, MRI or
CT is required to show the spinal cord. These must
be done urgently as early intervention may prevent irreversible paraplegia. Therefore the neurosurgeons must

also be informed promptly. Investigations should also
include those of the underlying cause.
Treatment is by decompression, which should be
performed as soon as possible to prevent irreversible
damage. Radiotherapy may be useful in malignant disease. If the patient has a known or suspected malignancy, dexamethasone should be given.

Subacute combined degeneration of
the cord
This is due to vitamin B12 deficiency and refers to demyelination of the posterior and lateral columns. The onset
is usually insidious and associated with a sensory
peripheral neuropathy. Clinical features include the
following:
• Loss of vibration and joint position sense, and positive Romberg sign: posterior columns.
• Weakness, hypertonia and extensor plantars: lateral
corticospinal tract.
• Absent knee jerks and reduced touch sensation:
peripheral neuropathy.
Treatment is with vitamin B12 injections intramuscularly.

Syringomyelia and syringobulbia
Syringomyelia is due to a longitudinal cyst in the cervical cord. As it enlarges it may extend into the dorsal
horns and white matter. Clinical features are insidious
and include the following:
• Dissociated sensory loss in the hand: loss of pain
and temperature sensation only. This may involve
the trunk and arm (’cape-like distribution’).
• Weakness and wasting of the small muscles of the
hand.
• Loss of tendon reflexes and arm pain.
As the syrinx expands, it may lead to spastic paraplegia
with upper motor neurone signs. Insidious loss of normal sensation may lead to joint destruction (Charcot’s
joints) or injury.
Treatment is by surgical decompression or aspiration.
If the syrinx extends into the brainstem it is called syringobulbia, and may affect cranial nerves, causing the
following symptoms:
• Facial pain or sensory loss: 5th cranial nerve.
• Vertigo and nystagmus: 8th cranial nerve.
• Facial, palatal or laryngeal palsy: 7th, 9th, 10th and
11th cranial nerves.
• Wasting of the tongue: 12th cranial nerve.
• Horner’s syndrome: sympathetic tract.

Miscellaneous neurological disorders

MISCELLANEOUS
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS

Motor neurone disease
This is a disease involving progressive degeneration
of the motor cortex, pyramidal and corticospinal
tracts, lower cranial nerve nuclei (hence the external
ocular movements are normal) and anterior horn
cells of the spinal cord. Both upper and lower motor
neurones can be affected but there are no sensory
abnormalities.
It is slightly more common in men, with a peak incidence between the ages of 50 and 70 years. The prevalence in the UK is about 6 in 100 000. Familial forms
account for 10% and are usually due to mutations in
superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), although mutations
of many other genes have recently been implicated in
the pathogenesis of both the familial and sporadic
forms. An association with frontotemporal dementia
is increasingly recognized.
Clinically there are four main patterns of disease:
• Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): combined
lower motor neurone wasting and upper motor neurone spasticity and hyperreflexia. Weakness starts in
the legs and spreads to the arms.
• Progressive muscular atrophy: anterior horn cell involvement, leading to lower motor neurone weakness, wasting and fasciculation of distal muscles,
which spreads proximally.
• Progressive bulbar palsy: LMN weakness and wasting of the tongue and pharynx, leading to dysarthria
and dysphagia. UMN features are usually also present, such as stiff tongue, spastic speech and brisk
jaw jerk. Long tracts usually become affected.
• Primary lateral sclerosis: disease isolated to upper
motor neurones; LMN signs may develop much
later. It is usually slower to progress than ALS.
Combinations of the above may occur.

Management
Management is symptomatic. The aim is to help the
patient with activities of daily living and to reduce
symptoms. Opiates should be considered for joint pains
and distress. Difficult decisions regarding nasogastric or
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding and
tracheostomy insertion and artificial ventilation may
arise. These interventions may prolong life but also
the process of dying. Riluzole, an antiglutamate drug,
is licensed in motor neurone disease and offers a small
increase in length of life. Other agents are used in trials.
Death usually occurs 2–5 years after diagnosis.

34

Horner’s syndrome
This describes the combination of miosis, partial ptosis
and ipsilateral loss of sweating (anhydrosis) caused by
interruption of the sympathetic nerve supply to the face.
The sympathetic nerves may be disrupted anywhere
along their course:
•
•
•
•

Brainstem: demyelination, vascular disease.
Cervical cord: syringomyelia.
Thoracic outlet: Pancoast’s tumour.
Neck (postganglionic): carotid artery aneurysm or
dissection, tumours.

Bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy
These two conditions result from disruption of lower
cranial nerve motor function, affecting the tongue, muscles of chewing/swallowing (therefore causing an increased risk of aspiration) and facial muscles.
Bulbar palsy is a lower motor neurone syndrome
with a flaccid, fasciculating tongue, normal or absent
jaw jerk and quiet nasal speech. It is caused by motor
neurone disease, Guillain–Barré syndrome, polio, syringobulbia and brainstem tumours.
Pseudobulbar palsy refers to bilateral upper motor
neurone lesions affecting the brainstem motor nuclei.
The tongue is spastic, jaw jerk is increased, speech is like
‘Donald Duck’ and there is emotional lability. Pseudobulbar palsy is more common and is usually due to
bilateral strokes. Other causes are multiple sclerosis
and motor neurone disease.

Bell’s palsy
This is an idiopathic unilateral lower motor neurone palsy
of the 7th nerve. Other causes must be excluded (see
Ch. 2). It is thought that viruses account for most cases.
Rapid onset of facial weakness occurs and may be
accompanied by pain below the ear. The characteristic
physical signs are described in Ch. 2 and shown in
Fig. 34.13.
Most patients recover fully in a few weeks. Approximately 15% have axonal degeneration and recovery may
only begin after about 3 months and may be incomplete.
Occasionally, aberrant reconnections are formed (e.g. eating may stimulate unilateral lacrimation –’crocodile
tears’).
High-dose prednisolone may reduce damage and
quicken recovery if given within a few days (ideally
<24 h) of onset. The role of antiviral drugs remains
controversial. The eye must be protected when closure
is incomplete: patches and artificial tears are useful.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• The assessment and management of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• The management of common diabetic emergencies.
• The growing public health problem of obesity and approaches to tackle this.
• How to approach the management of dyslipidaemia by considering the overall cardiovascular risk of a
patient.
• The common causes of metabolic bone disease and their management.
• The common disorders of the parathyroid gland and the management of acute hypercalcaemia.
• The management of patients with crystal arthropathy.
• The endocrine pathways and common disorders of the pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands.

DIABETES MELLITUS
Diabetes mellitus is a persisting state of hyperglycaemia
due to diminished availability or effectiveness of insulin. There were 171 million people in the world with diabetes in 2000 and this is projected to increase to 366
million by 2030. In the UK it is estimated that around
4.5% of the population have diabetes. The rising tide
of obesity is responsible for much of this increase (see
below) and type 2 diabetes accounts for around 90%
of cases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria are
used for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (Fig. 35.1).
In addition to these tests, diabetes can be diagnosed
on a random sample if above 11.1 and symptoms are
present. Impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance refer to fasting (no intake of calories
for 8 h) and postprandial abnormalities of glucose metabolism, respectively; the terms are not interchangeable. In both cases, patients have an elevated risk of
progression to frank diabetes and increased risk of
macrovascular disease (see below).

Classification and aetiology
Type 1 diabetes mellitus usually presents in childhood,
with a peak age of incidence of 10–15 years, although it
can occur at any age. Signs and symptoms develop fairly
quickly over days to weeks. Type 1 diabetes is due to autoantibodies directed against the insulin-producing
beta cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, causing
a low concentration of circulating insulin. These patients always require insulin replacement therapy and
there is an association with other autoimmune diseases.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-7234-3633-1.00035-X

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are usually older
and overweight, and the onset is more insidious. Type 2
diabetes is due to a combination of reduced sensitivity of
peripheral tissues to circulating insulin (insulin resistance) and failure of the beta cells to produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Patients may require
insulin if hyperglycaemia persists despite maximal doses
of oral hypoglycaemic agents, or in times of physiological
stress such as severe infections or after myocardial infarction. There is approximately 80% concordance between
identical twins for type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggesting
that inherited factors have a significant role. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly seen in children and may be linked
with rising levels of childhood obesity. A very small proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes have a familial
autosomal dominant form and also present at a young
age. This was previously called maturity onset diabetes
of the young (MODY) but is now classified according
to the genetic defect. Fig. 35.2 demonstrates some of
the differences in presentation between type 1 and type
2 diabetes.
Secondary diabetes mellitus may be caused by:
• Drugs (e.g. steroids).
• Gestational diabetes: patients develop impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes during pregnancy.
• Pancreatic disease (e.g. pancreatectomy, carcinoma
of the pancreas, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, haemochromatosis).
• Endocrine causes: Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly,
phaeochromocytoma.

Diabetes mellitus
acid decarboxylase or insulin can be assessed and may
help discriminate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes
in challenging cases. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
is often measured at presentation and may be useful
in distinguishing patients with diabetes from those with
transient hyperglycaemia. It is used more frequently for
diagnosis in the USA than the UK, where it is used for
monitoring.

Clinical presentation
Diabetes may be asymptomatic and discovered on routine screening where elevated levels of glucose are found
in the blood or urine, but approximately half of all
type 2 diabetics are undiagnosed.
Patients may present with non-specific symptoms
such as weight loss and lethargy, and they are more
prone to infection (e.g. carbuncles, thrush, cellulitis).
Polyuria and polydipsia are characteristic and relate to
the osmotic diuresis caused by the filtered glucose load
in the nephrons overcoming their ability to reabsorb it.
A significant proportion of patients presents for the
first time with a diabetic emergency: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the case of type 1 diabetes or, more rarely,
hyperosmolar non-ketotic (HONK) syndrome in the
case of type 2 diabetes.
Some patients, particularly type 2 diabetics with an
insidious onset of disease, may present with chronic
complications of their diabetes (see below). Fig. 35.2
summarizes the characteristic presenting features in
diabetes mellitus.

Chronic complications
The chronic complications of diabetes are summarized in
Fig. 35.3. They can be considered in two broad groups:
macrovascular and microvascular. ‘Macrovascular’ refers
to complications related to larger blood vessels (e.g. coronary artery, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular
disease). ‘Microvascular’ refers to complications related
to smaller blood vessels (e.g. diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). Some complications will
arise as a result of both macrovascular and microvascular
disease.
HINTS AND TIPS
In a patient with gangrene and a palpable dorsalis pedis
pulse, think of microvascular disease.

Macrovascular disease
This is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality
among diabetics. A diabetic’s risk of myocardial infarction is equivalent to that of a non-diabetic patient who

has had a previous infarction. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to assess and address all cardiovascular risk factors when managing diabetic patients
(see below).

Eyes
Retinopathy occurs in virtually all patients with type 1
diabetes, and maculopathy occurs in up to 20%. Patients
with type 2 diabetes often have a degree of retinopathy at
presentation. The stages of diabetic retinopathy are
shown in Fig. 2.22. Patients with maculopathy and preproliferative changes must be referred to an ophthalmologist; those with proliferative retinopathy require urgent
referral for laser therapy.

315

Metabolic and endocrine disorders
Diabetics are also at elevated risk of early cataract formation. Rubeosis iridis is a late complication related to new
vessel formation on the iris and may result in glaucoma.

Kidneys
The first sign of renal involvement is microalbuminuria
(30–300 mg albumin per 24 h). A negative dipstick test
does not exclude microalbuminuria and therefore more
sensitive tests must be used to screen diabetics for it
(estimation of the albumin:creatinine ratio in an early
morning specimen). Microalbuminuria affects 20–40%
of diabetics 10–15 years after diagnosis. These patients
can progress to macroalbuminuria/clinical nephropathy
(albumin excretion >300 mg per 24 h) and the renal
function then declines at a rate varying from patient to patient. Diabetic nephropathy is almost always associated
with the presence of retinopathy and its absence should
prompt a search for an alternative renal diagnosis.
The pathological hallmark of diabetic nephropathy
is the Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesion (nodular glomerulosclerosis).

Neuropathies
Diabetic neuropathy can take several forms.

Somatic neuropathies
Somatic neuropathies may take the following forms:
• Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy: this commonly
affects the lower limbs first, with numbness and
paraesthesiae of the feet, spreading up the leg, before
then affecting the hands (’glove and stocking’ pattern). Symptoms are predominantly sensory with
early loss of vibration sense and absent ankle jerks.
In advanced cases, the loss of pain sensation may
lead to the development of punched-out chronic ulcers at pressure points in areas of thick callus, and
may cause arthropathy (see below). Foot pulses
may be easily palpable; the foot may then become
infected and eventually gangrenous.
• Mononeuritis: may be due to entrapment or ischaemia. Commonly involved nerves include the third
cranial nerve, ulnar nerve and lateral popliteal nerve.
More than one nerve can be involved, causing
’mononeuritis multiplex’.
• Diabetic amyotrophy: painful asymmetrical weakness and wasting of the quadriceps muscles due to
lumbosacral plexopathy and polyradiculopathy. It
may recover.

Autonomic neuropathies
This may lead to symptoms of postural hypotension
(i.e. dizziness on standing), impotence, nocturnal diarrhoea and urinary retention. Gastroparesis may occur,
causing vomiting. There may be lack of awareness of
symptoms of hypoglycaemia, which is also more frequent in patients on beta-blockers.

316

Diabetic feet
Diabetic foot problems are due to a combination of neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetics are also
predisposed to infection, which may affect the soft tissue
and even bone (osteomyelitis) of ulcerated feet. This is a
common reason for presentation and admission.
Sensory neuropathy causes ulcers over pressure
points (e.g. metatarsal heads) and can cause joint deformity due to the lack of pain and proprioception (e.g. pes
cavus, Charcot’s joints). Peripheral vascular disease,
which may be due to small and/or large vessel occlusion, affects the toes primarily.

Skin
Complications occurring in the skin include the
following:
• Lipoatrophy: this is loss of fat at insulin injection
sites. It is much rarer now that human insulin has
replaced bovine or porcine insulin. The patient
should be advised to vary the injection sites because
the absorption of insulin at sites of atrophy is
unpredictable.
• Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum: these are yellowish areas on the skin with a violet edge and telangiectasia. Biopsy shows atrophy of subcutaneous collagen.
• Infections, such as boils, are more common.
• Granuloma annulare: annular plaques on the extremities.

Infections
Common infections are of the urinary tract and skin,
and candidiasis. Tuberculosis is also more common in
diabetics. Susceptibility to infection is due to a number
of factors, including a reduced immune response due to
hyperglycaemia, tissue ischaemia secondary to vascular
disease, and increased portals of entry such as ulcers.

Management of diabetes
General principles
COMMUNICATION
The transition of patients with chronic conditions such
as diabetes from paediatric to adult services must be
managed sensitively with the involvement of patients
and parents. This helps avoid them feeling abandoned
during this process.

Successful management of diabetic patients requires a
high level of patient education and motivation, and
this is achieved through regular follow-up with a

Diabetes mellitus
multi-disciplinary team involving doctors, nurses, ophthalmologists, dieticians and chiropodists/podiatrists.
The aims of continued assessment of diabetics are ongoing education, assessment of glycaemic control and
assessment of complications.
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
(DCCT) in type 1 diabetics and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in type 2 diabetics demonstrated
that tight control of blood glucose (aiming for an
HbA1c of 6.5–7.5%) reduces microvascular complications. This needs to be balanced against the increased
risk of hypoglycaemic episodes.
The UKPDS also demonstrated that tight control of
blood pressure reduces both macro- and microvascular
complications. This and other trials have suggested
that the aim should be a blood pressure below
130/80 mmHg. This emphasizes the need for a global
assessment of a diabetic’s cardiovascular risk factors
and aggressive management of all of them.
Many patients now monitor their own blood glucose
concentrations using blood glucose strips and an electronic meter. These records should be examined, together
with any corresponding hypoglycaemic symptoms. The
HbA1c should be checked every 3–6 months depending
on the level of control.
Microvascular complications must be monitored:
• Visual acuity checks together with examination of
the optic fundi for retinopathy.
• The feet should be examined for neuropathy, ischaemic changes and infection.
• Nephropathy should be sought by monitoring the
urea and electrolytes, and by testing for albuminuria.
Type 2 diabetes is usually treated initially with oral
hypoglycaemic drugs if dietary measures are unsuccessful, although many of these patients will require insulin
at some point. Type 1 diabetes is treated with injectable
insulin from the outset.

Diet and lifestyle
The diet should be low in fat (to help delay the progression of atherosclerosis) and low in refined sugars, but
high in complex carbohydrates (such as starch) and high
in fibre, which among other benefits helps to lower
the incidence of postprandial hypoglycaemia. Patients
should be encouraged to take regular exercise and reduce
energy intake in an attempt to maintain ideal body
weight. This often proves to be very difficult. Studies suggest that bariatric surgery for weight loss is an effective
therapy in type 2 diabetes, and may lead to remission.

Oral hypoglycaemic agents
These are usually started when diet and lifestyle measures fail to offer adequate control, although some organizations now suggest that metformin should be started

35

at diagnosis. Metformin is the first-line drug as it reduces
cardiovascular risk in obese patients and does not cause
weight gain. The next step is usually the addition of
a sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, newer agent (see
below) or insulin either alone or in combination. Acarbose is used less frequently. The choice of agent must
take into account side effects, contraindications and
the patient’s lifestyle and circumstances.

Biguanides
Metformin is the only available biguanide and is the
first-line therapy for patients without contraindications.
It exerts its effect mainly by decreasing gluconeogenesis
and increasing peripheral utilization of glucose; some
residual islet cell function is required. Gastrointestinal
side effects are common including nausea and diarrhoea. There is a risk of lactic acidosis and, although
it is rare, metformin should be avoided in patients with
predisposing conditions including renal failure, heart
failure and liver disease.

Sulphonylureas
These act mainly by augmenting insulin secretion and
therefore some residual pancreatic beta-cell activity is
required. There are several sulphonylureas but all are
probably equally effective, and are used as second-line
therapy or first-line therapy when metformin is contraindicated. The most frequent and significant side effect
is hypoglycaemia, which may persist longer than
expected due to the long half-life of some sulphonylureas. Elderly patients are particularly prone to hypoglycaemia and shorter-acting drugs should be used in
this population. Other people with increased risk include the undernourished and those with renal or cardiac impairment.
The sulphonylureas tend to encourage weight gain
and this can be a problem in obese patients whose
insulin resistance is worsened as a consequence.

Thiazolidinediones
Pioglitazone is currently the only licensed thiazoledinedione, and can be added as second- or third-line therapy. It increases insulin sensitivity. The main side
effect is fluid retention and it is contraindicated in heart
failure. There is also a slightly higher risk of fractures
and bladder cancer.

DPP-4 inhibitors
These include sitagliptin and vildagliptin and may work
via several mechanisms including increasing the action
of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). They are generally
well tolerated although gastrointestinal side effects
can occur and there may be an increased risk of pancreatitis. They are used as second-line therapy.

317

Metabolic and endocrine disorders
GLP-1 agonists

available and the preparations may be rapid-, short-,
intermediate- or long-acting. If possible, patients are
started on a ’basal-bolus’ regime: a once-daily injection
of a medium- or long-acting insulin, with short- or
rapid-acting insulin injection before or with meals. This
most closely resembles the physiological changes in
insulin levels, but requires education and commitment.
Some patients are best started on twice-daily injections of
’biphasic insulin’ – mixtures of a short- and intermediateacting insulin (Fig. 35.4).
Some patients may require continuous insulin infusion via an insulin pump if usual regimens fail. Pancreatic transplant may be performed if the patient meets
criteria; these include if the patient is also undergoing
renal transplant, or if the metabolic complications are
unacceptable in terms of frequency and severity.

This group of injection-only drugs includes exenatide
and functions by mimicking the action of GLP-1. They
are used as a third-line therapy.

Acarbose
Acarbose, an inhibitor of intestinal alpha-glucosidases,
delays the digestion of starch and sucrose and hence the
increase in blood glucose levels that follows a carbohydrate-containing meal. It may be used as an adjunctive
therapy but often causes intolerable flatulence.

Insulin
All type 1 diabetics are treated with insulin and many
type 2 diabetics require insulin to achieve satisfactory
glycaemic control. It is inactivated by gastrointestinal
enzymes and is administered by subcutaneous injection; pre-clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of inhaled insulin. Mixtures of available insulin
preparations may be required to maintain good control,
and these will vary for individual patients. Requirements may be affected by variations in lifestyle, other
medication and concurrent illness such as infection.
Patients should aim for blood glucose concentrations between 4 and 10 mmol/L for most of the time,
while accepting that on occasions they will be above
or below these values. They should be advised to look
for ‘peaks’ and ‘troughs’ of blood glucose and to adjust
their insulin dosage only once or twice weekly. Animal
insulin, human insulin and insulin analogues are

Diabetes and surgery
Diabetic patients should be first on the operating list
and fasted on the morning of surgery. Diet-controlled
diabetics simply require careful monitoring of glucose
levels. Oral agents should be avoided on the morning
of surgery and can be recommenced with the first meal
postoperatively. If glucose levels are poorly controlled,
if oral intake will be problematic postoperatively, or if
the procedure is long, IV insulin may be required (see
below).
For patients already on insulin, long-acting preparations are usually discontinued the night before surgery.

Diabetes mellitus
IV insulin is started early on the day of the operation,
and can be given either with potassium and dextrose
in the same bag (GKI infusion) or separately (’sliding
scale’). The sliding scale regimen usually consists of a
5% dextrose/20 mM KCl infusion given according to
the patient’s fluid requirements, and runs concurrently
with a 1 unit/mL infusion of soluble insulin in 0.9%
saline (i.e. 50 U Actrapid in 50 mL 0.9% NaCl). The capillary glucose is checked on an hourly or 2-hourly basis
and the rate of insulin infusion changed accordingly. It
is important to give both infusions via the same cannula
to avoid hyper- or hypoglycaemia if one cannula becomes blocked. When patients start to eat and drink,
they may be restarted on the normal insulin regimen.
COMMUNICATION
Patients are often well informed about their diabetes.
Ensure that any modifications to their therapy are
discussed with and explained to them.

Diabetic emergencies
Hypoglycaemia
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia include sweating, hunger
and tremor (autonomic symptoms) and very low glucose concentrations may cause drowsiness, seizures,
transient neurological symptoms and loss of consciousness. It is very common in diabetics, but there are many
causes as outlined below.

Aetiology
Hypoglycaemia may occur after a meal or after a fast.
The aetiology of fasting hypoglycaemia includes the
following:

35

blood tests may exclude certain causes (e.g. liver function tests, LFTs). Measurement of insulin and C-peptide
levels will distinguish between endogenous and exogenous hyperinsulinaemia; C-peptide is produced from
the breakdown of pro-insulin and is only raised with
endogenous hyperinsulinaemia. Sulphonylurea levels
may also be helpful. When the diagnosis is not clear,
other investigations may be needed:
• Consider a short synacthen test for Addison’s
disease.
• Thick and thin blood films for malaria if there is a
suggestive history.
• A prolonged inpatient fast with the intention of
provoking hypoglycaemia is carried out when a patient reports typical symptoms but the attacks are
not witnessed. Frequent measurement of blood
glucose, together with insulin and C-peptide levels,
is carried out.

Management
If the patient is conscious, dextrose tablets, sugary
drinks, or glucose gel should be given, followed by complex carbohydrate. If unconscious, an infusion of 20%
or 50% glucose should be given intravenously. Glucagon IM can be given as an alternative – this is a polypeptide hormone produced by the alpha cells of the
pancreatic islets of Langerhans. It increases plasma glucose by mobilizing glycogen stored in the liver, and will
only be useful in patients with adequate glycogen stores.
For patients who have taken a long-acting preparation, a continuous IV glucose infusion for 24 h may
be required. If an underlying cause is found it should
be treated on its own merits. In diabetic patients, issues
surrounding education and awareness of hypoglycaemia should be addressed.

• Drugs: excessive insulin or sulphonylureas. This is
usually accidental, but large doses may be taken deliberately, particularly by medical and paramedical
staff. Alcohol binges, especially with decreased food
intake, may also lead to hypoglycaemia.
• Endocrine causes: pituitary insufficiency, Addison’s
disease and insulinomas.
• Postgastrectomy and functional hypoglycaemia.
• Liver failure.
• Inherited enzyme defects.
• Non-islet cell tumours: usually large tumours, producing IGF-1 or IGF-2
• Immune hypoglycaemia (e.g. anti-insulin receptor
antibodies in Hodgkin’s disease).
• Malaria.

Diabetic ketoacidosis

The cause may be obvious in the case of drug-induced
hypoglycaemia in a diabetic patient. In others, simple

• Urea and electrolytes, arterial blood gases, full blood
count, glucose, blood cultures.

Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in type 1 diabetics. It may
be the mode of presentation, or may be precipitated by
an inadequate insulin dose or an intercurrent illness
(e.g. infection or myocardial infarction). There is usually a gradual deterioration over hours to days.
Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal
pain and vomiting. There may be evidence of the underlying cause. Patients often hyperventilate to compensate
for the metabolic acidosis (Kussmaul respiration)
and their breath smells of ketones (like nail-varnish
remover). There are physical signs of dehydration. As
the condition worsens, lethargy, confusion, drowsiness
and ultimately coma may occur.

ketones. In some centres serum ketone testing is
available.
• ECG.

never occurs as there is enough endogenous insulin
remaining to suppress ketone formation. However, an
initial check for ketones should be carried out.

The diagnosis of DKA requires the demonstration of
ketosis and acidosis. It is important to look for and treat
the underlying cause. After the initial arterial blood gas,
venous blood gas or bicarbonate is often sufficient for
monitoring.

Investigations

Management
Correction of dehydration takes precedence. These patients are potassium-depleted overall but the serum concentration may be normal or high as the acidosis causes
potassium to move out of the intracellular compartment. Therefore the serum potassium concentration
can fall precipitously as acidosis is corrected and it must
be monitored closely and replaced.
Some 6–9 L of IV fluid may be required and the first
2 L can be given over the first hour. Initial choice of fluid
is usually 0.9% saline unless there is circulatory compromise when colloid may be preferred. Sodium bicarbonate is infrequently used and controversial. An IV
infusion of insulin titrated to the blood glucose is commenced. Once the blood glucose drops to around
15 mmol/L, the fluid replacement may be modified to
include dextrose until the patient is eating and drinking.
In children, fluid requirements need to be calculated
more accurately as cerebral oedema may occur with
over-aggressive fluid administration.
A nasogastric tube may need to be inserted to reduce
the risk of aspiration from the gastric stasis that occurs
in this condition. Prophylactic low-molecular-weight
heparin is commenced as there is a significant risk of venous thromboembolism.
If there is evidence of infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used and attempts should be made to identify the precipitant. The inflammatory markers may rise
in the absence of infection. The patient should be observed very closely, with a low threshold for admission
to the high-dependency or intensive care unit. IV insulin
should be continued until the acidosis is corrected and
the patient is eating and drinking.

Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar
non-ketotic coma
Clinical features
This occurs in type 2 diabetes; the patient is often elderly
and may not be a known diabetic. Precipitants are as for
DKA but onset is gradual, over days. By the time of presentation blood glucose is usually very high (higher
than in DKA) and plasma osmolality is increased with
significant hypernatraemia. Polyuria leads to severe dehydration. Neurological symptoms such as confusion,
seizures and coma may occur. Ketoacidosis almost

• Blood tests: full blood count, serum glucose, U&Es,
LFTs. Plasma osmolality should be calculated.
• Urine analysis for infection and ketones.
• ECG.
• Further investigations directed to find the underlying cause.

Management
Rehydration is usually with normal saline and patients also require IV insulin, at a lower dose than
for DKA. If the sodium concentration is very high it
may be tempting to give hypotonic saline. However,
this is not used as it can cause cerebral oedema and
myelinolysis by lowering the osmolality too quickly,
and because these patients are so volume depleted
their total body stores of sodium are low and require
replacement. Central venous pressure monitoring
may be required. Patients are at a very high risk of
venous thromboembolism and therapeutic dose
anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin
is used. The mortality rate is up to 50%.

HINTS AND TIPS
Osmolality can be calculated:
2(Na þ K) þ glucose þ urea.

OBESITY AND METABOLIC
SYNDROME
Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater
than 30. The normal range is 19–25. Central adiposity
increased waist circumference:height ratio is associated
with greater health risks, including type 2 diabetes
mellitus, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, osteoarthritis and cancer. There are several definitions of metabolic syndrome, each comprising a
combination of hypertension, low HDL, hypetriglyceridaemia, raised fasting glucose, insulin resistance and
obesity.
In 1980, 6% of adult males and 8% of adult females
were obese. In 1998, these figures had increased to 17%
and 21%, respectively. It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of the adult population is overweight
or obese and there is certainly a growing problem
among children. This trend constitutes an enormous
public health issue with widespread changes in dietary
and exercise patterns required.

35

Thyroid disorders

Management

Clinical assessment

Patients should be given lifestyle and dietary advice and
support. Those patients with a BMI >28 with co-morbid
conditions that may benefit from weight reduction, and
those with a BMI >30, are considered for drug therapy
after exercise, diet and behavioural intervention has
been tried. Orlistat inhibits the absorption of fat in
the intestine and therefore causes side effects of steatorrhoea, urgency and oily spotting. Sibutramine has been
discontinued in the UK due to cardiovascular risk. Orlistat may be continued beyond 3 months if there is evidence of 5% weight loss.
Morbidly obese patients with a BMI >40 (or >35
with co-morbidity) in whom there has been a failure
to lose weight despite all conservative measures at a specialist clinic may be considered for surgery. This takes
two forms: malabsorptive surgery where bypass procedures are performed or restrictive surgery where the size
of the stomach is reduced.

Most patients are asymptomatic. The history should
cover the following:
• Duration of goitre and rate of change: long-standing
goitres suggest benign disease.
• Local symptoms: dysphagia, dyspnoea and hoarseness; all are uncommon.
• Symptoms of hypo- or hyperthyroidism (see below).
• Goitrogenic drugs (e.g. lithium, amiodarone).
• Prior exposure to radiation (medical or environmental) especially in childhood: risk factor for benign
and malignant thyroid nodules.
• Age and sex: incidence of thyroid cancer peaks
between 30 and 50 and is around 3 times more
common in women.
• Family history: ask about a history of goitre (suggesting autoimmune disease) or of thyroid cancer (suggesting familial thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine
neoplasia).
• Tenderness: subacute thyroiditis.
Physical examination should look for the following:

The following investigations are important in patients
with goitre and thyroid cancer:

Thyroid gland

• Smooth toxic goitre: Graves’ disease.
• Smooth non-toxic goitre: congenital, physiological
(e.g. in puberty or pregnancy), thyroiditis (e.g. autoimmune, subacute) iodine deficiency.
• Multi-nodular goitre: usually euthyroid, although
nodules may become autonomous and cause
thyrotoxicosis.
• Single thyroid lump: approximately 10% are malignant. Causes include cyst, adenoma, malignancy, a
single palpable nodule within a goitre.

T4 + T3

Fig. 35.5 Control of thyroid hormone production via the
hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis. TRH, thyrotrophinreleasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.

• TFTs: hyper- or hypothyroidism. TSH is usually checked
first; if abnormal, free tri-iodothyronine (T3) and
thyroxine (T4) are measured.
• Calcitonin secretion: increased in medullary thyroid
cancer and should be measured in patients with a
positive family history.
• Thyroid size and nature: assessed using ultrasound,
CT or MRI scan. Ultrasound is quick to perform and
can differentiate between cystic and solid nodules. It
cannot distinguish benign from malignant lesions.
CT or MRI are useful in assessing compression or
invasion of other structures.

321

Metabolic and endocrine disorders
• Respiratory function tests including flow–volume
loop: if signs of upper airways obstruction are present.
• Radionuclide imaging (thyroid scintigraphy): can
distinguish ‘hot nodules’ (high uptake of radioisotope) from ‘cold nodules’ (due to lack of concentration of radioisotope). Unfortunately, there are no
specific features that indicate the benign or malignant nature of a thyroid nodule. Malignant nodules
are more likely to be cold than hot, although most
cold nodules are benign. Even so, the presence of
a hot nodule does not exclude malignancy.
• Fine-needle aspiration cytology: performed on
nodules where there are suspicious features in the
history or examination. It can be performed in
outpatients and is well tolerated; cytology is not
completely reliable as false-positive and falsenegative results occur.

Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism results from deficiency of thyroxine (T4)
or tri-iodothyronine (T3). The prevalence is up to 2% in
women; it is around five times less common in men.

Aetiology
Primary thyroid failure may take the forms described
below:
• Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis:
this is around 5–8 times more common in women
than in men and tends to affect the middle aged
and elderly. Patients may present with a firm, nontender goitre, hypothyroidism, or both. It is associated with vitiligo, pernicious anaemia, insulindependent diabetes mellitus, Addison’s disease and
premature ovarian failure. Biopsy shows a lymphocytic infiltrate with destruction of follicles and variable fibrosis.
• Idiopathic atrophic thyroiditis: this autoimmune
condition may represent progression or a different
presentation of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.
The incidence increases with age and it is commoner
in women.
• Previous treatment for hyperthyroidism: operative
or radioiodine.
• Congenital hypothyroidism: the prevalence in the
UK is 1 in 3500–4000 infants and it is diagnosed
in the first week of life by routine screening, measuring TSH or T4. It is usually due to thyroid agenesis,
which is mostly sporadic, or dyshormonogenesis,
which is due to autosomal recessively inherited enzyme defects. An example is Pendred’s syndrome,
characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, goitre
and nerve deafness in homozygotes.
• Iodine-deficient hypothyroidism: this is a major
cause of hypothyroidism and goitre worldwide,

322

although most iodine-deficient people are euthyroid
even though they have a goitre.
• Iatrogenic hypothyroidism: long-term iodine therapy, for example in expectorants, may result in hypothyroidism. Other drugs include amiodarone and
lithium carbonate.
Secondary thyroid failure is caused by diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary, resulting in reduced levels of
TRH or TSH. These are rare.

Clinical features
The onset is insidious and the symptoms often nonspecific. Common presenting symptoms include tiredness, lethargy, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, hoarseness and dryness of the skin. However,
virtually any organ system can be affected (Fig. 35.6). Very
rarely it presents as myxoedema coma (see below).

Investigations
The following investigations are important in patients
with hypothyroidism:
• In primary disease, free and total T4 are reduced and
serum TSH is high.
• In subclinical hypothyroidism, T4 may be normal,
with a high serum TSH.
• In secondary hypothyroidism, the free and total T4
are reduced and the TSH is usually also low. This picture is also seen in unwell people without thyroid
disease (‘sick euthyroid’) and patients on steroids
and anticonvulsants.

macrocytosis.
• ECG: sinus bradycardia, low-voltage complexes.

Treatment
Thyroxine sodium is the treatment of choice for maintenance therapy. Usual maintenance doses are between
100 mg and 200 mg daily. The initial dose is usually
50 mg, increased as necessary over a few weeks, and even
lower doses (25 mg) are started in elderly patients or patients with cardiac disease to avoid worsening angina or
precipitating a myocardial infarction. Treatment is monitored by serum TSH and serum T4 and is nearly always
lifelong except in cases of subacute or silent thyroiditis.
Current guidelines advise treating subclinical hypothyroidism if the TSH is above 10 mU/L. It is sometimes necessary to rule out adrenal insufficiency (for instance in
secondary hypothyroidism) before starting treatment,
as giving thyroxine can precipitate an adrenal crisis if
there is concomitant glucocorticoid deficiency.

Myxoedema coma
This is uncommon. It is typically seen in the elderly and is
precipitated by infection, myocardial infarction, treatment
with sedatives, or inadequate heating in cold weather. Most
patients have hypothermia and are hypotensive with heart
failure, hyponatraemia, hypoxia and hypercapnia.
Treatment is with T3 intravenously because of its
rapid action. IV hydrocortisone is also given, particularly if pituitary hypothyroidism is suspected. Supportive measures are also needed, including IV fluids,
antibiotics, ventilation and slow rewarming. T4 can be
substituted after 2–3 days if there is a clinical improvement. Mortality is up to 20%.

Thyrotoxicosis
Thyrotoxicosis is the condition resulting from raised
levels of circulating free T4 and free T3. It affects approximately 10 in 1000 women and 1 in 1000 men. Hyperthyroidism indicates thyroid gland overactivity, which
may cause thyrotoxicosis. However, the two terms are
often used interchangeably.

Aetiology
Primary hyperthyroidism
Graves’ disease
This accounts for up to 80% of cases of hyperthyroidism. It is caused by the production of autoantibodies
that stimulate the TSH receptor. There is a painless

35

diffuse goitre in more than 90% of patients. In addition
to the general features of thyrotoxicosis (see below), features specific to Graves’ disease may occur, including
ophthalmopathy, pretibial myxoedema and thyroid
acropachy.
The ophthalmopathy includes grittiness and increased tear production, periorbital oedema, conjunctival oedema (chemosis), proptosis, diplopia, impaired
visual acuity and corneal ulceration due to exposure.
It is clinically obvious in up to 50% of patients with
Graves’ disease but subclinical ophthalmopathy can
be detected in more than 90% by CT scan or MRI, revealing enlargement of the extraocular muscles caused
by lymphocytic infiltration, oedema and later fibrosis.
Pretibial myxoedema occurs in 1–5% of patients
with Graves’ disease and consists of painless thickening of the skin in nodules or plaques, generally over
the shin.
Thyroid acropachy occurs in less than 1% of patients
and resembles finger clubbing.

Other causes of primary hyperthyroidism
Toxic multinodular goitre and toxic adenoma account
for most of the remaining causes. Less common causes
include metastatic thyroid cancer, genetic causes such as
the McCune–Albright syndrome and TSH receptor mutations, ectopic thyroid tissue (e.g. struma ovarii) and
high iodine load (e.g. in contrast or amiodarone).

Secondary hyperthyroidism
This is very uncommon. Causes include TSH-secreting
pituitary adenoma and trophoblast or germ-cell tumours
secreting large amounts of human chorionic gonadotrophin, which has mild thyroid stimulating effects.

Thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism
This may occur with destructive thyroiditis such as
in postpartum thyroiditis, autoimmune thyroiditis,
subacute/de Quervain’s thyroiditis (see below) and
amiodarone-induced thyroiditis, or with excessive T4
administration or self-administered T4.

Clinical presentation

with Graves’ ophthalmopathy, large goitres, recent
treatment for thyrotoxicosis or severe non-thyroid
illness. T4 and T3 are usually both raised, but in some
cases only one or the other may be elevated. It is
therefore usually prudent to assess levels of both. Excess oestrogens, protein-losing states, drugs and hereditary abnormalities can alter the binding of T4 to
thyroxine-binding globulin, making total T4 levels
inaccurate in these situations. Free T4 assays are
therefore preferable.
• Thyroid autoantibodies: in Graves’ disease, TSHreceptor antibodies (TRAb) are elevated, and may
be useful where there is confusion about the
diagnosis.
• Thyroid imaging: if a toxic nodule or thyroiditis is
suspected a radioisotope thyroid scan may be performed. In the case of thyroiditis a low level of uptake is seen; a toxic nodule appears as a ‘hot spot’.
In Graves’ disease there is diffusely increased uptake.

Thyroid disorders

Management
General principles
Treatment options include drugs, radioiodine and
surgery. Most patients under 50 years old with Graves’
disease receive a course of antithyroid drug as initial treatment. There is a significant risk of relapse after drug treatment, and it is more likely in younger patients and those
with a large goitre. Relapse after a period of drug therapy
should be treated with iodine-131 (radioiodine) or subtotal thyroidectomy. Subtotal thyroidectomy is often
recommended in young patients with large goitres to
remove the neck swelling.
Toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goitre are treated with radioiodine or surgery. All options should be
discussed with the patient and a joint decision should
be made. Beta-blockers are useful to ameliorate the
symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.

Antithyroid drugs
In the UK, carbimazole is the most commonly used
drug. It is metabolized to methimazole, the active agent.
Propylthiouracil may be used in patients who suffer sensitivity reactions to carbimazole and is preferred in pregnancy. Both drugs act primarily by interfering with the
synthesis of thyroid hormones.
Carbimazole is given in a daily dose of 15–60 mg
and maintained at this dose until the patient becomes
euthyroid, usually after 4–8 weeks. The dose may then
be gradually reduced to a maintenance dose of 5–15 mg
daily, adjusted according to response. Patients are advised to report any infectious symptoms immediately,
as agranulocytosis is a rare complication. Rashes are
more common.
If symptoms are profound, a combination of higherdose carbimazole together with T4 50–150 mg daily may
be used in a ‘block and replace’ regimen. A euthyroid
state may be achieved more quickly with this regimen.
Treatment with either regimen is usually for 18 months
followed by monitoring.
Iodine may be given 10–14 days before surgery in
addition to carbimazole to assist control and to reduce
vascularity of the thyroid.
Propranolol is useful for the rapid relief of thyrotoxic
symptoms before a euthyroid state is achieved. Betablockers are also useful for the control of supraventricular arrhythmias secondary to thyrotoxicosis.

Radioiodine
This is commonly used for adenomas or toxic multinodular goitre. In the USA it is also commonly first-line treatment for Graves’ disease. Radioactive sodium iodide
(Na131I) is concentrated by the thyroid and causes cell
damage and cell death. Hypothyroidism may therefore
develop at any stage after treatment, and so the patient
should be under regular follow-up. Radioiodine is used
increasingly for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis at all ages,

35

particularly where medical therapy or compliance is a
problem, in patients with cardiac disease and in patients
who relapse after thyroidectomy. Contraindications include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnancy is safe 4
months or more after treatment. Radioiodine may
worsen the ophthalmopathy of Graves’ disease.

Subtotal thyroidectomy
This is more commonly performed for adenoma or
multinodular goitre than for Graves’ disease, in whom
it is reserved for those with a large or obstructive goitre.
The aim of surgery is to remove sufficient thyroid tissue
to cure hyperthyroidism. One year later, approximately
80% of patients are euthyroid, 15% hypothyroid and
5% have relapsed. Complications include hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve damage and bleeding
into the neck causing laryngeal oedema.

Thyrotoxic crisis (‘thyroid storm’)
This is an uncommon, life-threatening exacerbation of
thyrotoxicosis with a mortality of up to 20% with treatment. Precipitating factors include thyroid surgery,
radioiodine, withdrawal of antithyroid drugs, iodinated
contrast agents and acute illnesses (e.g. stroke, infection,
trauma and diabetic ketoacidosis). In addition to general symptoms, common features are hyperpyrexia, severe tachycardia and psychiatric symptoms including
anxiety, delirium or psychosis. It requires emergency
treatment with oxygen, IV fluids due to profuse sweating, propranolol (5 mg IV) for control of tachycardia,
IV hydrocortisone (which inhibits peripheral T4 conversion to T3), oral iodine solution (to block release of thyroid hormone) and propylthiouracil (to prevent new
synthesis of thyroid hormones).

Subacute (de Quervain’s) thyroiditis
Various viruses (e.g. enterovirus or Coxsackievirus) can
cause subacute thyroiditis. Patients present with pain, a
small, tender goitre and initially thyrotoxicosis caused
by release of stored thyroid hormones. There may be
a history of preceding ‘influenza-like’ illness. Some
weeks later, there is a period of hypothyroidism followed by the recovery of normal thyroid function 3–6
months after onset.
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is raised and
there is low radioisotope uptake by the thyroid. LFTs
may be abnormal. Treatment is with NSAIDs for mild
symptoms and with high-dose prednisolone for moderate or severe thyroiditis. The dose is gradually tailed off
in subsequent weeks.

Thyroid malignancy
The incidence of thyroid cancer has risen greatly in the
last 50 years. This may be due to improved diagnosis of
small tumours. Prognosis is generally good, but worse

325

Metabolic and endocrine disorders
in older age groups, if metastases are present at presentation, and with anaplastic carcinoma.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma
This accounts for 70–80% of thyroid malignancies and is
more common in women; the peak age of onset is 30–50
years. It may be locally invasive or multifocal, treatment is
by surgical excision, and the 10-year survival rate is 95%.
HINTS AND TIPS
The most common thyroid carcinoma is Papillary
(P-opular). It also has P-sammoma bodies on histology.
It causes P-alpable lymph nodes (lymphatic spread).

Follicular thyroid carcinoma
This occurs in older people (peak incidence 40–60 years)
and accounts for around 10% of thyroid cancers. Distant
metastases develop in around 15% of patients. Treatment is by thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation of
the thyroid remnant. The 10-year survival rate is 80%.
Fine needle aspiration biopsy may not be able to distinguish between follicular adenoma and carcinoma, and
these patients often undergo surgery with the diagnosis
being confirmed on pathology of the excised specimen.

Anaplastic carcinoma
Anaplastic carcinoma is uncommon. The peak incidence is at 60–70 years. The malignant cells are atypical
and undifferentiated, and the mean survival is only 6
months from diagnosis.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma
This is rare, accounting for around 4% of thyroid cancer.
The cells secrete calcitonin and other hormones. The prognosis is poor. Family members should be screened as it is a
feature of multiple endocrine neoplasia (see below).

Primary thyroid lymphoma
Lymphoma arising in the thyroid is almost always nonHodgkin’s lymphoma. There is an increased risk in
patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Most are B-cell
tumours, which are treated with chemotherapy, often
combined with radiotherapy.

LIPID DISORDERS
Hypercholesterolaemia is widely prevalent in Western
societies. In the UK 59% of adults have serum total cholesterol concentrations above 5.0 mmol/L. There is an

326

association between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular (CV) risk. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles
are the main carriers of cholesterol to the liver and
peripheries; LDL levels are positively associated with
CV risk. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are involved
in ‘reverse cholesterol transport’ from the peripheries
to the liver, and levels are inversely related to CV risk.
In assessing patients it is more important to make an
assessment of their overall cardiovascular risk to guide
your advice and management decisions than to focus
on individual risk factors (see below). In this way therapy may be targeted at those with most to gain.

Classification of hyperlipidaemia
The genetics of hyperlipidaemia are complicated; most
commonly it is polygenic, with high serum cholesterol
concentrations and normal triglyceride concentrations.
It is greatly influenced by dietary lipid intake. ’Monogenic’
forms are less common; some of these are discussed
below.

Primary hyperlipidaemia
Familial combined hyperlipidaemia has a prevalence of
1 in 100 and is associated with high cholesterol and/or
high triglyceride concentrations. It is heterogeneous and
the causative gene has not been definitely identified.
Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal dominant condition and is due to LDL receptor deficiency,
resulting in an increase in LDL particles in the circulation.
The prevalence of heterozygotes is approximately 1 in
500. Homozygotes (prevalence 1 in 250 000) can have
serum cholesterol levels of up to 30 mmol/L or more
and may develop coronary artery disease in their teenage
years.
Familial hypertriglyceridaemia is also an autosomal
dominant condition and can cause pancreatitis. Patients
may have eruptive xanthomata. Triglycerides may also
be raised in diabetes, alcoholism and obesity.
Other types of dyslipidaemia are rare. Cases of primary hyperlipidaemia are generally managed by lipid
specialists.

Secondary hyperlipidaemia
Causes include diabetes mellitus, excess alcohol, hypothyroidism, cholestasis (such as in primary biliary
cirrhosis), chronic renal impairment, nephrotic syndrome and synthetic oestrogens.

Investigations
A fasting blood sample is required for measurement
of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol
and serum triglycerides. The total cholesterol:HDL

Lipid disorders
cholesterol ratio is usually calculated as it is a better indicator of cardiovascular risk than values in isolation.

Management
Causes of secondary hyperlipidaemia should be treated.
Where there is no secondary cause, dietary measures
should be tried first, including reduction of total energy
and saturated fat intake and increasing the consumption
of oily fish. However, the average fall in total cholesterol
concentration with a general lipid-lowering diet is only
2%. Drug treatment is aimed at high-risk patients, taking
into account other cardiovascular risk factors.

Drugs
Statins
The statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase,
an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, especially
in the liver. They are usually first-line therapy. There is
evidence that statins produce important reductions in
CV events in high-risk patients. They should be used
with caution in those with a history of liver disease,
and LFTs should be checked after starting treatment.
Side effects include reversible myositis.
Treatment should be stopped if there are symptoms of
myopathy or significantly raised creatinine kinase. Patients should therefore be advised to report unexplained
muscle pain, tenderness and weakness. Other side effects
include headache, altered LFTs (which occasionally necessitates stopping therapy) and gastrointestinal effects
(e.g. abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting).

Fibrates
Their main action is to decrease serum triglyceride but
they also tend to reduce LDL cholesterol and raise
HDL cholesterol. They can cause a myositis-like syndrome, especially in patients with impaired renal function and those on a statin. They are considered when
statins are not tolerated.

Ezetimibe
This drug reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. It may be used when a statin is not tolerated or
in addition to a statin to achieve target levels.

Anion-exchange resins (bile-acid sequestrants)
These drugs are rarely used and include cholestyramine
and colestipol. They reduce LDL cholesterol but can aggravate hypertriglyceridaemia, and may interfere with
the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Supplements
of vitamins A, D and K and of folic acid may be required
when treatment is prolonged.
Side effects are mainly gastrointestinal, including
change in bowel habit, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Other drugs should be taken at least 1 h before, or 4–6 h after cholestyramine or colestipol to
reduce possible interference with absorption.

35

Nicotinic acid group
The value of nicotinic acid is limited by its prostaglandin-mediated side effects, including flushing, itch and
nausea. In high doses it lowers both cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations by inhibiting synthesis, and increases HDL cholesterol. Troublesome side effects may
be improved by the co-prescription of aspirin and gradually increasing the dose.

Dietary supplements
Fish oils lower triglyceride levels but supplementation
above dietary intake is not currently recommended. Soluble fibre supplements (such as ispaghula husk) can be
used as an adjunct to a lipid-lowering diet in patients
with mild hypercholesterolaemia. It probably acts by reducing reabsorption of bile acids. Plasma triglycerides
remain unchanged. Plant sterols show promise but further large-scale trials are awaited.

The use of lipid-lowering drugs
The use of lipid-lowering therapy should form part of an
integrated approach to the assessment and treatment of
CV risk, including interventions directed at smoking,
lifestyle, obesity, blood pressure and use of antiplatelet
therapy.
Lipid lowering appears to reduce CV risk regardless
of baseline serum cholesterol levels. However, the
absolute risk reduction is greater if the patient’s risk
for CV disease is higher. Therefore guidelines aim
to target those groups at highest CV risk to maximize
gains.

Secondary prevention
This group includes those with known coronary heart
disease or ’CHD equivalents’ including other atherosclerotic vascular disease, diabetes, renal dysfunction and
inherited dyslipidaemias. Therapy aims to achieve a total cholesterol <4 mmol/L and LDL <2 mmol/L.

Primary prevention
Risk is estimated using equations such as the Framingham risk equation. This is incorporated into the Joint
British Societies’ risk assessment charts which can be
found in the British National Formulary. These charts
may underestimate risk in certain groups such as those
with a strong family history, hypertriglyceridaemia,
premature menopause, impaired glucose tolerance or
fasting glycaemia and in certain ethnic minorities, e.g.
those from the Indian subcontinent. Clinical judgement
must always be used, but formal assessment and lipidlowering therapy should be prioritized in those with
10-year risk of greater than 20% to achieve the levels
mentioned above.

bone matrix and a reduction in bone mass per unit
volume of anatomical bone. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined osteoporosis as a bone
mineral density (BMD) 2.5 standard deviations
below the mean value for young adults (T-score).
Osteopenia is defined as a T score between –1.0
and 2.5.
The prevalence of osteoporosis in white women
aged 50–59 years is 4% and the prevalence in those
aged 80 years or over is around 25%. Osteoporosis
predisposes patients to fractures, commonly of the
hip, vertebrae or wrist. It is estimated that almost
200 000 osteoporosis-related fractures occur in the
UK each year. These are associated with considerable
morbidity and mortality.

COMMUNICATION
The communication of levels of risk to patients is difficult.
The use of risk prediction charts to illustrate risk may help.

Aetiology and pathogenesis
Involutional or primary osteoporosis
Involutional bone loss commences at age 35–45 years
in both sexes but is accelerated in women following
the loss of sex steroids at the menopause, explaining
the higher incidence in postmenopausal women. Agerelated bone loss is increased by smoking, alcohol, inactivity, low BMI and impaired vitamin D production.

Secondary osteoporosis
Causes include steroid therapy, hypogonadism, alcohol
abuse, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, anticonvulsants and some chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cystic fibrosis.

Clinical features
Osteoporosis does not cause pain (or other symptoms)
until a fracture occurs. The risk of fracture is related to
the BMD but also to conditions predisposing to falls
(e.g. stroke, parkinsonism, dementia, visual impairment). These must also be assessed.

35

case therapy is instituted. All those with osteoporosis are
treated.

Drugs
Treatment options include bisphosphonates, strontium
ranelate, denosumab, raloxifene (a selective oestrogen
receptor modulator), calcitonin and intermittent parathyroid hormone. Bisphosphonates are first-choice
therapy in most cases and are generally well tolerated.
In patients who are unable to take them, strontium
ranelate or denosumab are considered second line. Raloxifene may be considered for secondary prevention.
Other treatments are approved but used less frequently,
and hormone replacement therapy (previously used
frequently in postmenopausal women) is no longer
recommended as first-line therapy. Supplementation
of calcium and vitamin D3 should be considered in
all patients.
Patients on long-term steroids are particularly at risk
and a low threshold is needed for therapy.

Investigations

Paget’s disease

• Blood tests, including a bone profile (calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase), should be normal.
Abnormalities should prompt a search for an underlying cause.
• BMD is estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. There is no evidence for population-based screening. It is performed if there are
risk factors and therapy is being considered (e.g. premature menopause, steroid therapy). It may also be
done following a fragility (low trauma) fracture, an
X-ray demonstrating osteopenia or for monitoring
the effect of therapy. As well as the T-score (see
above), a Z-score is calculated, which is an agematched BMD score. It is used in assessment of children and young adults who have not yet reached
peak bone density.
• Thyroid function, luteinizing hormone (LH), folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone should
be measured to exclude secondary causes. Fifty per
cent of males with hip fractures are hypogonadal.

In Paget’s disease, there is uncontrolled bone turnover
with areas of increased localized osteoclastic resorption.
This is followed by disordered osteoblastic activity,
leading to new bone formation that is structurally
abnormal and weak (Fig. 35.9). The aetiology is unknown, although viruses have been implicated and
genetic factors probably play a role. It is more common
in Anglo-Saxons, and the incidence increases with age.
Studies in Europe and New Zealand indicate that the
overall prevalence has fallen by 50% since the 1970s.

Prevention and treatment
General principles
An holistic approach to the reduction of fracture risk is
important. Falls risk should be assessed and interventions implemented, alcohol excess and smoking should
be discouraged and a good diet with regular activity
encouraged.
Patients with osteopenia are given lifestyle advice
and monitored unless they have had a fracture, in which

Clinical features
The axial skeleton and femur are most commonly affected. The condition is most commonly asymptomatic
but can cause bone pain, tenderness and deformity such
as an enlarged skull and bowed (sabre) tibia. Complications include:
• Fractures of long bones.
• Conductive deafness due to involvement of the
ossicles.
• Progressive occlusion of the foramina of the skull
can cause deafness due to 8th cranial nerve compression, visual impairment due to 2nd nerve compression, or long tract signs due to basilar invagination
and cervical cord stenosis.
• High-output cardiac failure (with >20% skeletal
involvement).
• Osteogenic sarcoma.
• Osteoarthritis of related joints.

Investigations
Serum alkaline phosphatase is markedly raised but serum calcium and phosphate are usually normal; 24-h
urinary hydroxyproline output is raised and reflects
the increased bone turnover. There may be mild hypercalcaemia in immobile patients due to unopposed bone
resorption.
X-rays of affected bones show a mosaic of osteolytic
and sclerotic lesions, thickening of trabeculae and
thick cortices with an enlarged irregular outline. Isotope bone scans will demonstrate the extent of skeletal
involvement.

Treatment
Asymptomatic patients only require treatment if there is
active disease at a site where complications might occur.
In addition to standard analgesia, specific treatment is

330

given for bone pain, bone deformities, hypercalcaemia
or complications. Drug treatment is with bisphosphonates or calcitonin.

Bisphosphonates
Bisphosphonates are adsorbed on to hydroxyapatite
crystals and inhibit osteoclasts, slowing bone resorption
and reducing bone turnover. Newer bisphosphonates
are preferred, such as oral risedronate (30 mg once daily
for 2 months followed by monitoring) or IV zoledronic
acid (5 mg as a single dose).

Calcitonin
Calcitonin opposes many of the effects of parathyroid
hormone (PTH) and together with PTH regulates bone
turnover and calcium balance. It is useful when bisphosphonates are not tolerated but is less effective and has
considerable side effects.

Metabolic bone disease

Osteomalacia
Osteomalacia results from inadequate mineralization of
bone after fusion of the epiphyses has occurred. Rickets
is the result if this occurs during the period of bone
growth before epiphyseal fusion.

Aetiology
The aetiology of osteomalacia includes:
• Lack of dietary vitamin D.
• Ineffective conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D3) to previtamin D3 by ultraviolet light in
the dermis. This is due to lack of sunlight and, in the
UK, is most commonly seen in Asians.
• Intestinal malabsorption (e.g. gluten-sensitive enteropathy and postgastrectomy states).
• Vitamin D resistance: commonly this is due to ineffective conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 in chronic renal disease. Other
causes are inherited deficiency of renal 1-alphahydroxylase and end-organ receptor abnormality.
• Drug induced: chronic anticonvulsant therapy may
induce liver enzymes, leading to the breakdown of
25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
• Excessive renal phosphate loss due to Fanconi’s
syndrome or a specific defect in renal phosphate
handling.

Clinical features
Bone pain and tenderness are common. Fractures may
occur, especially of the femoral neck. There is often a
proximal myopathy, which may cause a waddling gait
and difficulty in rising from a chair.
In rickets, there are deformities of the legs (bow-legs
and knock-knees), the chest (rachitic rosary) and the
skull. There may also be features of hypocalcaemia
(e.g. tetany).

Investigations
Biochemistry
• Serum calcium and phosphate: tend to be decreased
but may be normal.
• Serum alkaline phosphatase activity: increased.
• Urinary calcium excretion: low.
• Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3: low except in resistant cases.
• 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3: low in renal failure.
• PTH is high because of secondary hyperparathyroidism due to hypocalcaemia.

Imaging
X-rays of bone in rickets show cupped, ragged metaphyseal surfaces. In osteomalacia, there is cortical bone loss

35

and pseudofractures (Looser’s zones), which are small
translucent bands perpendicular to the bone and
extending inwards from the cortex. They are best seen
on the lateral border of the scapula, on the femoral neck
and in the pubic rami.
Isotope bone scans show a generalized diffuse
increase in uptake of isotope.

Treatment
Dietary vitamin D deficiency can be prevented by taking
an oral supplement of 10 mg (4000 IU) of ergocalciferol
daily. Vitamin D deficiency caused by intestinal malabsorption or chronic liver disease usually requires
vitamin D in pharmacological doses, such as calciferol
tablets up to 1 mg daily. Calcium supplements may also
be required, as may phosphate supplements in hypophosphataemic disease.
The newer hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives (alfacalcidol and calcitriol) have a shorter duration of action
and therefore have the advantage that problems associated with hypercalcaemia due to excessive dosage are
shorter lived and easier to treat.
In patients with chronic renal impairment, alfacalcidol or calcitriol should be prescribed. All patients receiving pharmacological doses of vitamin D should have
their serum levels of calcium checked at intervals and
whenever nausea and vomiting are present. Breast milk
from women taking pharmacological doses of vitamin
D may cause hypercalcaemia if given to an infant.

Renal osteodystrophy
The term ‘renal osteodystrophy’ is used to cover the various forms of bone disease that develop in chronic renal
failure. These include:
• Delayed epiphyseal closure in children and young
adults.
• Rickets or osteomalacia.
• Osteitis fibrosa cystica (brown tumours) due to secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
• Generalized or localized osteosclerosis.
The kidney does not excrete phosphate effectively as its
function drops. This hyperphosphataemia stimulates
PTH secretion. The impaired hydroxylation of 25hydroxyvitamin D causes osteomalacia and hypocalcaemia, further stimulating the release of PTH (secondary
hyperparathyroidism) and increasing osteoclast
activity.

Management
Dietary phosphate intake is reduced and oral phosphate
binders are used to help control the hyperphosphataemia. Calcium and hydroxylated vitamin D supplements
can be given when the phosphate levels are controlled

normalize the calcium and reduce the level of PTH further. Renal replacement therapy in the form of haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or transplantation will help
restore calcium and phosphate metabolism in end-stage
renal failure.
In tertiary hyperparathyroidism (see below), subtotal parathyroidectomy is required.

that albumin is below 40 g/L and perform a similar subtraction for high albumin.

Clinical features
HINTS AND TIPS
For the clinical features of hypercalcaemia, remember
bones (bone pain), stones (renal stones), groans
(peptic ulcer) and moans (psychiatric disease).

HYPERCALCAEMIA
The causes of hypercalcaemia are given in Fig. 35.10 and
calcium homeostasis is outlined in Fig. 35.11. The two
most common causes are primary hyperparathyroidism
and malignant disease. Prolonged venous stasis when
taking blood can cause spurious hypercalcaemia, and
an unexpected result should be verified with repeat
measurement.
The physiologically relevant measurement is of ionized (unbound) calcium. This can be determined by
correcting serum total calcium levels for serum protein
or albumin concentrations. The higher the protein concentration, the more calcium is protein bound, and the
lower the proportion of ionized calcium. Add
0.02 mmol/L to calcium concentration for every 1 g/L

These include abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting. Polyuria, polydipsia and dehydration are common
and may be severe. Depression and confusion may occur. Renal stones may form with chronic hypercalcaemia, and renal impairment may develop due to
hypovolaemia or nephrocalcinosis. Arrhythmia has
been reported. There may also be features of the underlying cause.

Investigations
• Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, calcium profile and PTH, liver and thyroid function tests. PTH
should be suppressed unless hyperparathyroidism
is the cause.
• Consider measuring vitamin D levels and PTHrelated peptide (PTHrp).
• Chest X-ray – any evidence of malignancy or
sarcoidosis?
• Other investigations will be determined by the differential diagnosis (e.g. isotope bone scan, myeloma
screen, etc.).

Management
Severe hypercalcaemia is a medical emergency. In the
acute phase, it is essential to rehydrate with normal saline
as the renal excretion of calcium is dependent on exchange with sodium ions in the nephron. IV bisphosphonate therapy (usually a single dose of pamidronate) is
given and can be repeated if necessary. High-dose prednisolone is effective for hypercalcaemia secondary to myeloma, sarcoidosis and excess vitamin D but otherwise is
of little value. Calcitonin and loop diuretics are now
rarely used.
After the acute phase, it is important to elucidate and
treat the underlying cause.

HYPERPARATHYROIDISM
Hyperparathyroidism results from excess circulating
PTH, which increases serum calcium by stimulating calcium absorption from the gut, increasing mobilization

Classification and aetiology
• Primary hyperparathyroidism (overproduction of
PTH in the absence of other abnormalities) is
usually due to a single benign adenoma but less
commonly may be due to multiple adenomas, carcinoma or hyperplasia. It may be associated with
other endocrine abnormalities as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. Ectopic
PTH production is very rare; more commonly, cancers of the lung or breast produce PTHrp, which
causes a similar picture.
• Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when PTH
levels are persistently and appropriately raised to
maintain calcium concentrations in the face of a disorder that lowers calcium levels. Causes include

Increased
osteoclast
reabsorption
Bone

chronic renal failure and deficiency of vitamin D
(e.g. due to inadequate intake or malabsorption).
• Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is the continued secretion of excess PTH after prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism. The parathyroids act autonomously
and cause hypercalcaemia, despite correction of the
original cause of the secondary hyperparathyroidism. This occurs in some patients with end-stage
renal failure.

Clinical features
Hyperparathryoid bone disease can cause reduced bone
density and may result in fractures. In addition, the features of hypercalcaemia discussed above may be
present.

Investigations
In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum calcium is
raised. Blood samples should be repeated without
venous compression to confirm the level. Serum

333

Metabolic and endocrine disorders
phosphate is low and alkaline phosphatase is high,
reflecting increased bone turnover. There may be a mild
renal tubular acidosis with a high serum chloride level
(i.e. a normal anion gap), and serum PTH is raised.
In secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal failure,
serum calcium is low or normal and phosphate is normal or high. Both of these metabolic abnormalities
stimulate the secretion of PTH. A 24-h urine collection
may be required to rule out familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcaemia.
In both, X-rays show subperiosteal resorption, most
marked in the hands, and evidence of osteitis fibrosa
cystica. A chest X-ray (CXR) should be performed to
look for a carcinoma producing PTHrp. A skull X-ray
shows a ‘pepper pot’ appearance.
In tertiary hyperparathyroidism, serum calcium is high
and extra-skeletal calcification, including calciphylaxis
(calcium deposition in blood vessel walls causing thrombosis and skin necrosis), may occur. Imaging of the neck is
only used to plan surgery and not for diagnosis.

Treatment
Parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic disease. The decision is more difficult in asymptomatic patients, many of whom will progress to overt disease.
Guidelines suggest surgery when there is persistent
hypercalcaemia greater than 0.25 mmol/L above normal, renal impairment, BMD T-score < 2.5 or age below 50. The parathyroid glands may be localized by CT
scan, SPECT scan or technetium isotope (sestamibi)
scans, which can detect adenomas. The operative procedure may be a full bilateral exploration (if multiple adenomas are present and in certain other situations), or a
minimally invasive endoscopic procedure with intraoperative PTH monitoring (when a single adenoma is
seen on imaging). All abnormal glands are removed.
If all the glands are hyperplastic, three and a half are
usually removed, leaving the last half in situ. Serum calcium and magnesium should be monitored postoperatively, as removal of the glands may lead to rapid and
prolonged hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia as
the ‘hungry bones’ recover the minerals lost during
the period of hyperparathyroidism.
Asymptomatic patients not meeting the criteria for
surgery should be monitored. If surgery is contraindicated, bisphosphonates or calcimimetics, e.g. cinacalcet,
may be useful.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM
Hypoparathyroidism is usually secondary to thyroid
surgery. Primary (idiopathic) hypoparathyroidism is
an autoimmune disorder associated with vitiligo,

334

Addison’s disease, pernicious anaemia and other autoimmune diseases, and it may be part of autoimmune
polyendocrine syndrome (see below). Infiltration due
to metabolic disease such as Wilson’s disease and
haemochromatosis can cause destruction of the parathyroid gland, but this is very uncommon. Rare mutations can cause inherited abnormalities of parathyroid
development, such as in DiGeorge’s syndrome, when
it is associated with intellectual impairment, cardiac
abnormalities and thymic hypoplasia.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a syndrome of variable end-organ (kidney and bone) resistance to PTH.
It is associated with intellectual impairment, short stature, a round face and short metacarpals and metatarsals.
Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism describes the appearance present in pseudohypoparathyroidism but
without the calcium abnormalities, and is due to resistance to PTH in bone with normal renal responsiveness.
Other causes of hypocalcaemia include chronic renal
failure and osteomalacia. In acutely ill patients, acute
pancreatitis and rhabdomyolysis can cause hypocalcaemia. Causes are summarized in Fig. 35.12.

Clinical features
Hypocalcaemia causes circumoral paraesthesiae,
cramps, anxiety and tetany, followed by convulsions, laryngeal stridor, dystonia and psychosis. Trousseau’s sign
(carpopedal spasm when the brachial artery is occluded
with a blood pressure cuff) and Chvostek’s sign (twitching of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped)
may be present.

Investigations

Clinical features

Serum calcium is low, phosphate is high and alkaline
phosphatase is normal. Additional tests include serum
urea and creatinine, serum PTH level, parathyroid antibodies and vitamin D metabolite levels. Serum PTH will
be low in hypoparathyroidism but raised in pseudohypoparathyroidism. Investigations for other endocrinopathies may be required in certain cases.
X-rays of the hands show short fourth metacarpals in
pseudohypoparathyroidism.

These can be deduced from knowledge of the effects of
the various pituitary hormones. Growth hormone and
gonadotrophins are often affected first.

HINTS AND TIPS
In hypocalcaemia always check magnesium.
Hypomagnesaemia often follows hypocalcaemia and
magnesium supplementation may be needed for
the calcium to respond to treatment.

• GH: fatigue, increased abdominal adiposity, and reduced muscle strength and exercise capacity.
• LH and FSH: in women, there is oligomenorrhoea,
infertility, dyspareunia, breast atrophy, loss of pubic
and axillary hair and hot flushes; in men, there is loss
of libido, impotence, infertility, flushes, regression
of secondary sexual characteristics, soft testes and
fine wrinkles on the face.
• TSH: fatigue, muscle weakness, sensitivity to cold,
constipation, apathy, weight gain and dry skin.
• ACTH: fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, postural hypotension, weakness, nausea and vomiting, hypoglycaemia, apathy, reduced libido and loss of pubic
and axillary hair.
• Prolactin: inability to lactate.

Treatment
Emergency treatment of hypocalcaemia is with 10 mL 10%
IV calcium gluconate, repeated as necessary. IV magnesium
chloride may also be required if there is hypomagnesaemia.
Long-term treatment is with alfacalcidol or calcitriol.
Serum calcium should be monitored to prevent
hypercalcaemia.

HINTS AND TIPS
The symptoms of hypopituitarism are non-specific but
must not be dismissed. A high index of suspicion
may be required to make the diagnosis.

Investigations

PITUITARY DISORDERS

Hypopituitarism
The anterior pituitary produces six hormones – adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH),
FSH, LH, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin (PRL). Hypopituitarism may be associated with loss of
all or some of these hormones. The clinical and biochemical presentation will depend on which hormones are deficient and to what extent. The most common cause is the
mass effect of pituitary adenomas (which if functional may
cause features of hypersecretion of a particular hormone –
see below), with additional loss of pituitary function after
surgery and pituitary irradiation. Other causes include hypothalamic tumours and cysts, peripituitary tumours (e.g.
gliomas and meningiomas, craniopharyngiomas), infiltrative diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis), pituitary infarction (Sheehan syndrome) or haemorrhage, and metastatic lesions.
HINTS AND TIPS
Sudden haemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary
causes headache, diplopia and hypopituarism and is
known as ’pituitary apoplexy’.

Dynamic tests involving stimulation are occasionally
needed to assess ACTH or GH; otherwise, basal levels
provide all the necessary information. Most pituitary
hormones are secreted in a pulsatile fashion and therefore random levels are not very useful.
• Serum thyroxine and TSH: a low thyroxine level together with a low or normal TSH level is suggestive of
secondary hypothyroidism.
• To assess ACTH, cortisol should be measured between
8 and 9 a.m. If low or intermediate, serum ACTH
should be measured; the sample needs to be taken at
9 a.m. into a cold tube and immediately put on ice. Alternatively, an insulin tolerance test or metyrapone test
can be performed but these are rarely done.
• FH/LSH: these should be measured in the morning
with a simultaneous serum testosterone level in
men and serum oestradiol level in women.
• Growth hormone: as basal levels of GH fluctuate
greatly, if deficiency is suspected an insulin tolerance
test is required; the normal response is GH release as
glucose levels decrease. IGF-1 levels will also be low
in GH deficiency.
• Prolactin: this is performed to look for raised levels
which would signify a prolactinoma.
• CT/MRI/visual field assessment: see investigations
sections below.

335

Metabolic and endocrine disorders

Management
Hormone replacement involves the use of multiple
hormones. Hydrocortisone is given for adrenal failure,
T4 for hypothyroidism, testosterone for hypogonadal
men and oestrogen for hypogonadal premenopausal
women. Recombinant human GH is given by injection
to patients with significant symptoms. Careful instruction and patient compliance are mandatory for longterm recovery.

Pituitary tumours
Pituitary tumours may be non-functioning or may
secrete hormones. Non-functioning and prolactinsecreting are the most common. The incidence of clinically significant pituitary tumours varies from 0.2 to 3 in
100 000 population and the prevalence is about 9 in
100 000. PRL- and ACTH-secreting tumours occur most
commonly in 25–35 year olds, GH-secreting tumours in
those aged 35–50 years, and non-functioning tumours
usually present after the age of 60 years. They can also
be classified by their size as microadenoma (<1 cm
diameter) or macroadenoma (>1 cm).

Clinical features
The clinical features relate to (i) pressure effects from the
tumour mass, (ii) the effects of hypersecretion of any
hormone and (iii) the suppression of other pituitary
hormones (hypopituitarism).
Pressure effects cause headaches and there may be
compression of the optic chiasm causing bitemporal
hemianopia. Seizures, other cranial nerve signs and hydrocephalus may occur with large masses. Extension
into the hypothalamus affects appetite, sleep and temperature regulation.
The effects of functioning tumours depend on the
hormone secreted. They may cause acromegaly via
GH, amenorrhoea–galactorrhoea syndrome via PRL,
or Cushing’s disease via ACTH. Secondary thyrotoxicosis is rare. The features of hypopituitarism have been
described above.

Investigations
Endocrinological assessment is performed as described
above.
MRI scan is the best modality with which to assess the
anatomy of the tumour. Formal visual field assessment is
important as many of these tumours have effects on the
visual pathways, particularly at the optic chiasm.

Management
Management may be medical, surgical or with radiotherapy. Aside from prolactinomas, surgical resection is the
treatment of choice in most cases. The surgical approach
is usually trans-sphenoidal, but with larger masses a

336

transfrontal approach may be necessary. Drug therapy includes dopamine receptor agonists (e.g. cabergoline, bromocriptine) for prolactinoma; these inhibit PRL release
and induce shrinkage of the tumour in over 90% of cases.
Somatostatin analogues inhibit GH release and induce a
lesser degree of tumour shrinkage in most GH-secreting adenomas. They are usually used after surgery in acromegaly.

Acromegaly
Acromegaly is an insidious disease resulting from excessive circulating levels of GH in adults. Diagnosis is often
made years after symptoms first occur. The incidence is
approximately 5 per million per year and the prevalence
is 50 per million.
Acromegalic gigantism results from acromegaly in
young individuals before epiphyseal fusion, and is very
uncommon.

Aetiology
The commonest cause is a benign pituitary tumour secreting GH. Pituitary carcinoma and carcinoid tumours
that secrete hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone are
uncommon causes.

Clinical features
The clinical features of acromegaly are summarized in
Fig. 35.13.
HINTS AND TIPS
The diagnosis of acromegaly may become more
obvious by comparing old photographs of the patient
with their present appearance.

Cardiovascular problems are often the cause of mortality. Coronary artery disease, hypertension and diabetes
are more common than in the normal population. Cardiomyopathy may occur.
Headaches, visual field defects and cranial nerve
palsies may occur due to the mass effect of the pituitary
tumour. Hyperprolactinaemia (due to compression of
the pituitary stalk and therefore loss of tonic inhibitory
dopamine from hypothalamus – see below) is common
and hypopituitarism can also occur.
Sleep apnoea occurs in up to 50%.
HINTS AND TIPS
Historically, the patient may have noticed a change in
their hat size. Now it is more likely they have noticed a
change in glove size, or being unable to remove a
wedding ring.

Diagnosis
GH levels are elevated, although they may rise with
stress. Therefore, GH is measured during a glucose tolerance test. In healthy individuals, GH falls to <1 ng/mL
in the 2 h following a 75 g glucose load. In some centres,
insulin-like growth factor-1 levels are used to provide an
estimate of growth hormone levels as this fluctuates less
than GH itself.
Other investigations include the following:
• Assessment of visual fields: bitemporal hemianopia.
• Skull X-ray and MRI of the brain.
• Hand X-ray: tufting of the terminal phalanges and
increased joint spaces due to hypertrophy of the cartilage. The heel pad is usually thickened.

• CXR, ECG and echocardiogram: left ventricular
hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy.

Management
The aim of treatment is to relieve symptoms, reverse
somatic changes and reverse metabolic abnormalities.
Treatment is by surgery, radiotherapy or drugs.

Surgery
Surgery is the first-choice treatment. The transsphenoidal route is usually used. Up to 90% of microadenomas are cured, but the success rate is lower for
larger tumours. Complications include hypopituitarism, meningitis and intraoperative bleeding.

337

Metabolic and endocrine disorders

Clinical features

Radiotherapy
This is often used if attempts at surgery do not reduce GH
levels sufficiently. Hypopituitarism may occur, and regular tests of pituitary function should be performed. The
effect on GH secretion is slow, but this may be improved
with newer techniques such as proton-beam therapy.

Medical therapies
The most effective treatment is with octreotide, a somatostatin analogue. Somatostatin inhibits GH secretion. Side
effects include colicky abdominal pain and diarrhoea but
this usually settles with continued treatment. Gallstones
occur in approximately one-third of patients.

Prognosis
Untreated, the mortality rate is approximately twice that
in healthy individuals due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. There is also an increased risk of
colon cancer.

Prolactin disorders
PRL is the hormone most commonly secreted by pituitary tumours. Secretion of PRL is under constant negative control by the action of dopamine produced in the
hypothalamus and transported down the pituitary stalk,
such that interruption produces hyperprolactinaemia.
The causes of hyperprolactinaemia are summarized in
Fig. 35.14. It is more common in women.

In premenopausal women, the most common symptoms are oligomenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, infertility
and occasionally hirsutism. In men, symptoms include
reduced libido, hypogonadism, impotence, infertility
and galactorrhoea. Symptoms caused by large tumour
size are more common in men and postmenopausal
women, and include headache, visual field defects
and cranial nerve palsies. Varying degrees of hypopituitarism may be present.

Investigations
Elevated PRL levels should be confirmed on repeat testing. Other blood tests include thyroid function tests
(TFTs), renal and liver function, and a pregnancy test
in women. A careful drug history should always be taken.
Radiological assessment of the pituitary tumour
should be carried out with skull X-rays and MRI scan
of the brain. Full assessment of pituitary function
should be undertaken if a macroadenoma is suspected,
and visual fields should be assessed.

Management
Microprolactinomas are <10 mm on MRI. Dopamine
agonist therapy (bromocriptine, cabergoline) should
be first line as this is effective in most cases. Transsphenoidal surgery is usually successful for resistant
cases, but there is a small recurrence rate. PRL levels
are monitored and scans are repeated if there is evidence
of tumour growth, e.g. headache, visual field defects.
Macroprolactinomas are >10 mm on MRI. They can
be treated with drugs but if there are pressure effects, visual symptoms or pregnancy is considered (25% expand in pregnancy), surgery is usually performed.

Diabetes insipidus
Cranial diabetes insipidus is a rare condition due to deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP, also called antidiuretic hormone), one of the hormones released from
the posterior pituitary (the other is oxytocin). The differential diagnosis includes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (i.e. a lack of renal response to adequate
circulating vasopressin) and primary polydipsia or excessive drinking. Clinically, the patient presents with
polyuria, nocturia and polydipsia. Investigation is outlined in Ch. 15.

Causes of diabetes insipidus
Cranial diabetes insipidus (CDI)
Causes of acquired CDI are given in Fig. 35.15. The most

autosomal dominant trait or as part of the DIDMOAD
syndrome (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic
atrophy and deafness).

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
Familial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive. It is rare and is due to mutations of the AVP receptor or aquaporin 2 channel protein.
Causes of acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
are given in Fig. 35.16.

Treatment
For cranial diabetes insipidus, desmopressin (a vasopressin analogue) is the treatment of choice because it
has minimal pressor activity but prolonged antidiuretic
potency compared to vasopressin. It may be administered orally, intranasally or parenterally.
For nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, any metabolic
and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected and
any potential drug causes should be reviewed. In familial forms, thiazide diuretics or indometacin can reduce
urine output by up to 50%. NSAIDs may also be useful.
For patients with primary polydipsia, water restriction and treatment of any associated psychiatric disorder is required.

DISORDERS OF THE ADRENAL
GLANDS
Histologically, the adrenal glands are divided into the
medulla, which secretes adrenaline (epinephrine) and
noradrenaline (norepinephrine), and the cortex, which
is divided into three zones:

+

ACTH

Adrenal
cortex

Free plasma
cortisol

Fig. 35.17 Control of cortisol production via the
hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis. ACTH,
adrenocorticotrophic hormone; CRH, corticotrophin-releasing
hormone.

• The inner zone or zona reticularis produces sex
hormones.
• The middle zone or zona fasciculata produces
cortisol. Production is stimulated by ACTH released
by the pituitary gland. In a negative feedback loop,
cortisol reduces both corticotrophin-releasing hormone production in the hypothalamus and pituitary
release of ACTH (see Fig. 35.17).
• The outer zona glomerulosa produces aldosterone,
which is regulated through the renin–angiotensin
system.

Cushing’s syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome is the result of chronic exposure to
excess glucocorticoid. This is most commonly iatrogenic, secondary to glucocorticoid administration given
to treat inflammatory diseases. Causes of endogenous
Cushing’s syndrome include the following:
• Cushing’s disease: ACTH hypersecretion by a pituitary adenoma or corticotroph hyperplasia (70%).
• Primary adrenocortical tumours (15–20%).
• Ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by a variety of
ACTH-secreting non-pituitary tumours such as
small-cell lung carcinoma (10–15%).
The annual incidence of spontaneous Cushing’s syndrome is approximately 1 in 100 000 and is three to five
times more common in women than men.

Clinical features
The clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome are demonstrated in Fig. 35.18. Psychiatric disturbance may range
from anxiety to psychosis, and cognitive problems such
as short-term memory loss are common.

Investigations
The following investigations are important in Cushing’s
syndrome.
• Plasma cortisol: this will vary throughout the day
in normal individuals and should be measured at
9 a.m. and midnight. Levels will be raised in all
causes of Cushing’s syndrome.
• 24-h urinary free cortisol: this is a better predictor of
Cushing’s syndrome than plasma cortisol.
• Plasma ACTH: this will be high in Cushing’s disease
and ectopic ACTH production, and very low in adrenal cortisol hyperproduction.

340

• Dexamethasone suppression tests and corticotroph
function tests are outlined at the end of the chapter.
• Imaging of the adrenal glands (with CT scan) and
the pituitary (with MRI).
A 24-h urinary free cortisol measurement or a low-dose
dexamethasone suppression test is the best screening
tool but may give false positives in obesity, depression,
alcoholism and if the patient is on a hepatic enzymeinducing drug (as this increases the metabolism of
dexamethasone).

Management
Cushing’s disease
Trans-sphenoidal surgery is the first line of treatment
and is curative in approximately 80% of patients. Pituitary radiotherapy or drugs are used if surgery fails.
Metyrapone inhibits steroidogenesis and is the drug
of choice. Ketoconazole or mitotane may be used.

35

Disorders of the adrenal glands
Rarely, bilateral adrenalectomy is necessary, although there is a risk of causing Nelson’s syndrome,
a rapidly enlarging pituitary tumour resulting in
hyperpigmentation from excess beta-lipotrophin
(see box).

Adrenocortical tumours
Surgical removal of a benign adrenocortical tumour is
curative. Bilateral adrenalectomy necessitates replacement therapy with cortisol 20–40 mg daily and fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily. Carcinomas may recur.

Ectopic ACTH syndrome
Surgical resection of the tumour cures the hypercortisolism, although this is often not possible and medical
therapy is used to control cortisol levels.

Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease is primary adrenocortical failure. The
prevalence is approximately 100 per million per year
and the incidence is approximately 5 per 1 million
per year.

Causes
Causes of Addison’s disease include the following:
• Autoimmune adrenal destruction: this accounts for
up to 90% of cases in developed countries. Women
are affected 2–3 times more often than men. Up to
50% of patients have other autoimmune endocrine
deficiencies (see below).
• Infections: worldwide, tuberculosis is a common
cause. Cytomegalovirus and fungal infections may
cause adrenal failure in the context of HIV/AIDS.
• Adrenal haemorrhage/infarction: this may be
associated with sepsis, particularly meningococcal
septicaemia – the Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome. The presentation is usually acute.
• Metastatic carcinoma: especially from the breast and
lung.
• Inherited disorders: there are several familial disorders of adrenal function, which are all rare.

Clinical features
Symptoms and signs of Addison’s disease are predominantly caused by cortisol deficiency, although deficiencies of aldosterone and adrenal androgen will also be
present to varying extents (Fig. 35.19). The main symptoms are insidious and non-specific: fatigue, weight
loss, orthostatic dizziness and anorexia. Patients may
present with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). Hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes may occur
as a result of high beta lipotrophin levels (see box).

Fig. 35.19 Symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency.
ACTH, adrenocorticotrophic hormone.

Addisonian crisis may occur with sudden-onset adrenal failure (such as in haemorrhage) or increased cortisol requirements (such as in concurrent infection).
There is hypovolaemic shock, often with acidosis and
hypoglycaemia as well as the symptoms mentioned
above.
HINTS AND TIPS
The ACTH precursor, pro-opio melanocortin, is cleaved
to ACTH and beta-lipotrophin, which acts on
melanocytes, increasing pigmentation.

Investigations
The following are important investigations in patients
with Addison’s disease:

341

Metabolic and endocrine disorders
Serum renin is low and serum aldosterone is raised
(increased adosterone–renin ratio). Dynamic testing
may be required to confirm the diagnosis; a sodium
load or fludrocortisone dose is given and the aldosterone levels in serum or urine are measured. Imaging of
the adrenals is required following a positive test.
Secondary hyperaldosteronism is a result of high circulating renin. Causes include nephrotic syndrome,
heart failure, hepatic failure and bronchial carcinoma.

• Serum cortisol concentration: low.
• Adrenal autoantibodies are detected in approximately 50% of patients.
• Serum ACTH levels: raised in Addison’s disease and
low in secondary failure.
• Serum electrolytes: in an impending crisis there may
be hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and raised blood
urea.
• Short and long synacthen tests: described in ’Endocrine investigations’ (see below).
• Screening for other autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroid disease.

Management

Management

Tumours should be resected. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that can be given in primary or secondary aldosteronism.

In emergencies, IV saline and glucose are required. IV
hydrocortisone 100 mg 6-hourly is given. Underlying
infection must be treated.
Maintenance therapy is with hydrocortisone, usually
20 mg in the mornings and 10 mg in the evenings. The
dose of hydrocortisone should be increased during intercurrent illnesses and during surgery. Enzymeinducing drugs (e.g. phenytoin and rifampicin) may
also increase patient requirements for hydrocortisone.
Fludrocortisone is used to replace aldosterone because
aldosterone taken orally undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver. The dose is adjusted to maintain blood
pressure and potassium levels. The usual dose is about
100 mg daily.

Conn’s syndrome (primary
hyperaldosteronism)
This is a very rare condition, which is due to a unilateral
adrenocortical adenoma in 75% of cases. Other causes
include adrenal carcinoma or bilateral hyperplasia of
the zona glomerulosa.

Clinical features
The clinical features are due to excess production of aldosterone. Hypertension and hypokalaemia are the
principal features. Muscle weakness, polyuria and polydipsia may occur as a result of the hypokalaemia. The
diagnosis should be suspected in a patient with hypertension and hypokalaemia when not on a diuretic.
Sodium tends to be mildly raised but there is usually
no oedema.

Investigations
Serum potassium is low and should be measured while
the patient is not on drugs. Urinary potassium is increased for serum blood level. There is usually a metabolic alkalosis. Serum sodium may be mildly raised.

342

Phaeochromocytoma
This is a rare tumour arising from the chromaffin tissues
of the adrenal medulla, producing catecholamines.
Similar tumours may arise from the cells of the sympathetic ganglia. It may be associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, parathyroid adenoma and
neurofibromatosis.
HINTS AND TIPS
In phaeochromocytoma 90% are benign and 90% are
unilateral.

Clinical features
Symptoms and signs are due to the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). The most common are headache, sweating and
hypertension, which may be episodic. Others include
pallor, tachycardia and palpitations, nausea, tremor, visual blurring and chest pain. The blood pressure may
rise to very high levels and may precipitate a cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction or hypertensive encephalopathy. Occasionally, cardiomyopathy
occurs with chronic catecholamine exposure.

Investigations
Urine is collected for 24 h for measurement of adrenaline
(epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and
metanephrines. An abdominal CT scan may show the
tumour. PET-CT or scintigraphy is occasionally used.

Treatment
This is by surgical removal of the tumour. The patient
must be fully alpha-blocked with phenoxybenzamine
or phentolamine, and beta-blocked with propranolol

35

Miscellaneous endocrine conditions
before surgery to prevent the consequences of release of
catecholamines during operation. Changes in pulse and
blood pressure should be monitored closely. Alphablockade must be achieved before beta-blockade to
prevent unopposed alpha-agonism causing severe
hypertension.

MISCELLANEOUS ENDOCRINE
CONDITIONS

Multiple endocrine neoplasia
There are two main syndromes, both autosomal dominant and both rare. Tumours originate from two or
more endocrine glands that produce peptide hormones.
MEN type 1 refers to a predisposition to benign adenomas of parathyroid, pancreatic islet cell/gastrointestinal adenomas and pituitary adenomas. Other tumours
are also more common, including thymus, carcinoid
and adrenal tumours.
MEN type 2a refers to the association of phaeochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and
parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia.
In MEN type 2b there is phaeochromocytoma and
medullary thyroid cancer, but no parathyroid pathology. There are developmental abnormalities with a
marfanoid phenotype and intestinal and visceral
ganglioneuromas.
Family members should be screened. In type 1, fasting serum calcium should be measured. In type 2, pentagastrin and calcium infusion tests with measurement
of serum calcitonin will detect C-cell hyperplasia.
Urinary metanephrines should be measured for
phaeochromocytoma.
HINTS AND TIPS
Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a common MCQ
question. MEN I is three Ps (Pituitary, Parathyroid and
Pancreas), MEN II is two Cs (Catecholamines (i.e.
phaeochromocytoma) and medullary Carcinoma of the
thyroid) and parathyroid (for MEN IIa) or
mucocutaneous neuromas (for MEN IIb).

Autoimmune polyendocrine
syndromes
APS type 1 is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder characterized by hypoparathyroidism, adrenal
insufficiency and candidiasis. It usually becomes
clinically apparent in the second decade. Hypogonadism and gastrointestinal malabsorption also occur
frequently.

APS type 2 is more common. Around half of cases are
inherited but this may be in a dominant, recessive or
polygenic manner. Adrenal insufficiency is the most
common feature, often with thyroid disease and diabetes, and there may be a predisposition to non-endocrine
autoimmune disease.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
These inherited deficiencies of enzymes involved in glucocorticoid synthesis lead to deficiency of cortisol and
aldosterone, increased ACTH production and increased
synthesis of sex hormones. In children this may present
as failure to thrive, ambiguous genitalia in females, and
early virilization in males. It may present later with precocious puberty, or in early adulthood with hirsutism
and oligomenorrhoea.

Endocrine investigations
Some of the more complex investigations are covered
here in more detail.

Diabetes mellitus
Diagnosis
For the interpretation of results of these tests, see
Fig. 35.1.
• Random glucose: as the name sounds, a glucose
taken at any time. If very high, and symptoms are
present, it can diagnose diabetes.
• Fasting glucose: measured in a morning sample following an overnight fast.
• Glucose tolerance test/2-h glucose: a fasting sample
is taken first. The patient is then asked to drink a
solution with 75 g of glucose, and the blood sample
is repeated 2 h later.

Monitoring response to diet or treatment
• Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c): indicator of glycaemic control over the previous 2–3 months.
• Fructosamine: indicator of overall glycaemic control
over the previous 1–3 weeks.

Hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal
axis
Fig. 35.17 summarizes the control of cortisol levels via
the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis. These tests
are used to diagnose diseases of glucocorticoid excess
(Cushing’s disease, ectopic ACTH production, adrenal
hyperproduction of cortisol) and glucocorticoid
deficiency (pituitary hypoproduction of ACTH and
hypoadrenalism).

343

Metabolic and endocrine disorders

Dynamic tests for cortisol excess
Overnight dexamethasone suppression test
1 mg oral dexamethasone is taken at midnight; plasma
cortisol is measured at 9 a.m. the next morning. In normal patients, ACTH and cortisol production will be
suppressed by negative feedback.
In all cases of Cushing’s syndrome there is absence
of suppression of cortisol. In Cushing’s disease the feedback mechanism is less sensitive than normal (see high
dose dexamethasone test below). Ectopic ACTH production has no negative feedback mechanism. In adrenocortical tumours, ACTH will already be suppressed
and cortisol will remain high.

High-dose dexamethasone suppression test
This is used after other positive tests to differentiate between Cushing’s disease and ectopic ACTH production.
Plasma cortisol is measured; 2 mg of oral dexamethasone is taken every 6 h for 2 days. After 48 h from the
first dose, plasma cortisol is measured again. In normal
individuals, the plasma cortisol should be almost undetectable. In Cushing’s disease the less sensitive feedback
mechanism should be overcome by the high dose, and
the cortisol level should fall by at least half. Suppression
should not be seen in ectopic ACTH production.

CRH test
Plasma cortisol and ACTH are measured at several intervals shortly following administration of corticotrophinreleasing hormone (CRH). Ectopic ACTH production
should not increase, whereas a pituitary adenoma will
respond to the CRH, leading to a rise in ACTH and cortisol. This can be used with the high-dose dexamethasone test to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Tests for cortisol deficiency
Short synacthen test
Plasma cortisol is measured and 0.25 mg synacthen
(which has the same biological action as ACTH) is given
IM or IV. Plasma cortisol is re-measured after 60 min. In
normal patients, cortisol will rise by a minimum of
200 nmol/L to at least 500 nmol/L. The response will
be poor in any cause of hypoadrenalism.

Long synacthen test
In this test, 1 mg of synacthen is given by IM injection
daily for 3 days. Hypoadrenalism due to adrenal gland
atrophy as a result of chronic steroid treatment or

344

secondary hypoadrenalism show a response to this
level of stimulation. No response will be seen in adrenal hypofunction.

CRH test
This can be used to look for secondary hypopituitarism.
There will be a poor response to CRH administration.

Pituitary function tests
If suspected, initial blood tests should include TSH, T4,
T3, prolactin, growth hormone and insulin-like growth
factor-1, luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones,
testosterone and cortisol. Pituitary fossa imaging is then
undertaken (e.g. CT/MRI or lateral skull X-ray).
Dynamic tests are sometimes needed:
• Insulin tolerance test: this is used to assess ACTH
or GH deficiency. A bolus of insulin is given to
cause hypoglycaemia and stimulate ACTH and GH
release. A baseline blood sample for GH, cortisol
and glucose is taken. A fast-acting insulin is then
given and further blood samples taken at intervals.
Glucose <2.2 mmol/L must be achieved. Cortisol
and GH should rise.

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease producing a symmetrical inflammatory deforming polyarthropathy with extra-articular involvement of many organs.
It affects around 1% of Caucasian populations and is
three times more common in women than in men.
The peak age of onset is between 50 and 70 years, although it can start at almost any age. There is often a
family history and there is an association with certain
HLA serotypes, particularly HLA-DR4. There is a significant autoimmune component, but the nature of the interaction between genes and environment that triggers
the inflammatory process remains unclear.

Pathological features
The classic findings are chronic synovitis, with oedema
and inflammatory infiltrate, followed by the formation
of pannus, composed of inflammatory T cells, granulocytes, fibroblasts and granulation tissue. Pannus erodes
cartilage, bone and tendons. In all phases of RA, soft tissue
inflammation surrounds the joint, giving rise to one of its
characteristic features. Rheumatoid nodules are granulomata with a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis, surrounded
by macrophages, lymphocytes and fibroblasts. These are
usually subcutaneous, the most common site being the
extensor surfaces, especially the elbows. They can occur
in other tissues (e.g. lungs, heart and sclera). They imply
that the patient is rheumatoid factor positive. Patients
with severe disease are at risk of developing vasculitis,
usually of small to medium-sized vessels.

Clinical features
RA usually presents with an insidious onset of pain and
stiffness in the small joints of the hands and feet. There
is associated joint swelling and there may be progression to involve larger joints. Less common presentations include a relapsing and remitting arthritis of
changing joint areas (palindromic rheumatism), a persistent monoarthritis, systemic features before joint
problems are apparent, and an acute onset of widespread arthritis, especially in the elderly.
General features of the disease may precede joint involvement and include general malaise and fatigue.
Signs affecting the joints are described in Ch. 19. The
metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal
(PIP) joints and wrists are most commonly affected
(Fig. 36.1). Initially there is joint swelling, which may
progress to subluxation of joints and deformities. There
is wasting of small muscles resulting from disuse, vasculitis and peripheral neuropathy. There may be tenosynovitis and bursitis; rheumatoid nodules are present in
approximately 20% of patients. The feet are similarly
affected.
Atlantoaxial subluxation may give rise to neurological signs and spinal cord compression. Extra-articular
manifestations are summarized in Fig. 36.2.

Investigations
The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is made on
a combination of clinical and laboratory findings.
Investigations are discussed in Ch. 19. They should
include:

345

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders

Normal
MCP

PIP
DIP

Swan neck

Boutonnière

• Joint X-rays, especially of hands, wrists and feet:
to aid in diagnosis and to monitor baseline at presentation.
• Aspiration of synovial fluid, if appropriate.

Management
The aims of treatment are to control symptoms, to
maintain a normal life and to modify the underlying
disease process and inflammation. Physiotherapy will
help to keep joints mobile, strengthen muscles and prevent deformities. Surgery may be required to correct deformities (e.g. the repair of tendons, joint prostheses
and arthrodesis). Resting the joints will relieve pain,
and splints can help prevent deformities.

Drug treatment
Trigger

Ulnar deviation

While the initial measures should include analgesia
with paracetamol or preferably a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), the early use of diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is considered
best practice. The aim is to slow disease progression, slow
joint destruction and maintain function. Several drugs
that modify inflammatory cytokines are now available.
Corticosteroids remain useful and effective but have
numerous long-term side effects.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Fig. 36.1 Finger and hand abnormalities in rheumatoid
arthritis. DIP, distal interphalangeal joint; MCP,
metacarpophalangeal joint; PIP, proximal interphalangeal joint.

• Full blood count (anaemia of chronic disease,
thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia, leucopenia).
Renal and liver function tests may help exclude other
causes and will help with drug dosing. Potential
causes of anaemia in rheumatoid arthritis are outlined in Fig. 36.3.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
• Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies and
other autoantibodies including anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP).

346

These drugs have both analgesic and anti-inflammatory
effects but do not alter disease progression. They inhibit
the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes, of which there are
two main isoforms: COX-2 is the inducible isoform responsible for inflammation, whereas COX-1 is constitutive and thought to produce the beneficial effects of
prostaglandins. There are two categories of NSAID;
drugs in the first, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, inhibit both COX enzymes, reducing the production of
prostaglandins in all tissues. They can have side effects,
commonly gastrointestinal (including peptic ulceration, gastritis and haemorrhage), renal impairment
and fluid retention. They should be used with caution
in the elderly, during pregnancy and breastfeeding,
and in coagulation defects. To reduce side effects they
should be taken with food and combined with a proton
pump inhibitor.
The second category is the selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib). They are effective anti-inflammatory
agents with a better side-effect profile in reducing gastrointestinal complications. However, their use has
been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality
and they should only be used when regular NSAIDs
cannot be given.

Fig. 36.3 Causes of anaemia in rheumatoid arthritis.

Anaemia of chronic disease
Hypersplenism due to splenomegaly (Felty’s syndrome if
also neutropenic)
Chronic blood loss from peptic ulceration due to steroid
and NSAID administration
Bone marrow suppression by disease-modifying drugs
such as gold and penicillamine
Folate deficiency (increased utilization of folate)
NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

Conventional disease-modifying
anti-rheumatic drugs
DMARDs should now be considered early after the diagnosis of RA is made; the aim is to slow the disease process,
maintaining structure and function. The most common
drugs are methotrexate, sulfasalazine and ciclosporin.
Current guidance suggests starting treatment with a
combination of DMARDs where possible, which should
include methotrexate unless it is contraindicated.
Methotrexate is a folate antagonist used in cancer
chemotherapy. When taken once weekly, it has a

powerful disease-modifying effect on RA, often seen
within 4 weeks. Its side effects include gastrointestinal,
hepatic, bone marrow and pulmonary toxicity; hence, a
regular full blood count and liver function tests are
needed. It is contraindicated in pregnancy.
Sulfasalazine is an effective DMARD but can be limited by side effects, including rashes, gastrointestinal
intolerance, bone marrow suppression and hepatitis.
Ciclosporin is a calcineurin inhibitor. Leflunomide is
a further immunomodulating drug acting through inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis.
The antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and
chloroquine can be used as DMARDs and are better tolerated. However, they are less effective against more
severe RA. Retinopathy is a rare side effect. Gold and
penicillamine are now rarely used.

Corticosteroids
The short-term use of corticosteroids for rapid symptomatic control in new-onset RA or flares of disease is
well established. They are given alongside DMARDs,
but the dose is tapered as soon as possible to avoid
adverse effects. In a small percentage of patients,

347

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders
withdrawing steroids completely will cause a flare of
disease, and these patients may be reliant on long-term
low-dose steroids. Low-dose prednisolone may reduce
the rate of joint destruction in moderate-to-severe RA
of less than 2 years’ duration, and possibly has a small
disease-modifying effect in established disease. Corticosteroids may also be given intra-articularly to relieve
pain, increase mobility and reduce deformity in one
or a few joints.

Biological agents
In recent years there has been a huge increase in the
number of agents targeted at specific molecules involved in the inflammatory response. The first to become widely used were tumour necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-a) inhibitors, but agents against a wide array of cytokines have been developed. They are added to treatment when conventional DMARDs do not adequately
control disease. Side effects are mainly due to suppression of the immune response and hypersensitivity.
• TNF-a inhibitors: TNF-a is a potent proinflammatory cytokine thought to be important in RA. Etanercept is a recombinant TNF-receptor protein which
binds TNF-a. Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab and golimumab are monoclonal antibodies
against TNF-a. They often produce marked improvement in patients with poorly controlled disease. The
main concern is infection, especially reactivation of
TB. They are expensive and current UK practice is to
use them in patients with active RA not responding
to at least two DMARDs, including methotrexate.
• B-cell inhibition: rituximab is a monoclonal antibody
that selectively depletes CD20-positive B cells and is
used in lymphomas. It is used with methotrexate in
severe RA when treatment with other agents, including at least one TNF-a inhibitor, is unsuccessful.
• Other agents: tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody
targeting interleukin-6 (IL-6), is licensed for treatment when other agents have failed. Anakinra, an
IL-1 receptor antagonist, and abatacept, a T-cell modulator, are not currently used outside clinical trials.

Surgery
Joint replacement may be indicated for severe pain or
functional limitation despite maximal medical therapy.
The timing of the decision to proceed with surgery is often difficult; if there is significant muscle atrophy, the
patient may not benefit from the joint replacement.

Prognosis
RA is not just a joint disease limiting quality of life. It is a
systemic disease that in its most severe form causes
multi-organ dysfunction and shortens life. The life

348

expectancy of patients whose joint disease does not remit with therapy is on average 15 years less than similar
patients without RA.

OSTEOARTHRITIS
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint condition and affects approximately half the population by
the age of 60 years. OA is a degenerative disorder affecting mainly the weight-bearing joints (e.g. the hips and
knees). It is predominantly a disease of cartilage, which
becomes eroded and progressively thinned as the
disease proceeds. Risk factors include age, family
history, obesity and female gender. People in certain
occupations or sports players may be predisposed to
OA in specific joints. It may also be secondary to other
joint conditions and trauma.

Clinical features
Clinical signs and symptoms are described in Ch. 19.
Joints commonly affected by OA include the hips,
knees, distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, first metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and metatarsophalangeal (MTP)
joints, and lumbar and cervical spine. There is pain in
affected joints, which is worse with movement and towards the end of the day, superimposed on a background of pain at rest. Morning stiffness may occur
but usually lasts less than 30 min. The joints are stiff,
immobile and deformed.
On examination, there may be swelling due to bony
protuberances or joint effusions, crepitus on movement, limited joint movement and deformities. In some
patients there will be a degree of inflammation. The pattern of joint involvement tends to be asymmetrical. In
the hands, the most commonly affected joints are the
DIP joints (Heberden’s nodes), PIP joints (Bouchard’s
nodes) and first carpometacarpal joints, giving an appearance of ‘square hands’. Unlike RA, there are no
extra-articular manifestations of the disease.

Investigations
There are no biochemical abnormalities. Diagnosis is
based on clinical findings and radiological changes of
loss of joint space, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral
cysts and marginal osteophytes (Fig. 36.4).

Management
Treatment options include combinations of drugs,
physical treatments (e.g. weight reduction and heat
application), electrotherapy (TENS), exercises, aids (e.g.
walking sticks, special footwear, joint supports) and surgery (e.g. arthrodesis, arthroplasty, joint replacement).

Spondyloarthropathies

36

• Juvenile chronic arthritis.
• Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy.

Ankylosing spondylitis
This most commonly affects young men (sex ratio 2:1)
with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 2000. HLA-B27
is present in over 90% of patients.

Clinical features

Diseases. Journal of Medical Ultrasound. 2011 19(3):73–80,

Initially, simple analgesia (e.g. paracetamol) and topical
NSAIDs should be prescribed for the pain. Oral NSAIDs
are given if simple analgesia is not effective, and sometimes opioid analgesia is required. Intra-articular
corticosteroids can be used for inflammatory exacerbations. Glucosamine, chondroitin and intra-articular
hyaluronan are not currently recommended for the treatment of OA. Joint replacement is helpful in severe cases
where pain is debilitating and unresponsive to other
measures.

SPONDYLOARTHROPATHIES
This term (often replaced with ’seronegative arthritis’)
describes a group of related diseases with some common features including inflammation of joints of the
axial skeleton, asymmetrical oligoarthritis and enthesitis. There is an association with HLA-B27 with familial
clustering of cases. The following diseases are included:
•
•
•
•

Ankylosing spondylitis.
Reactive arthritis.
Enteropathic arthritis.
Psoriatic arthritis.

The onset is insidious, with lumbar spinal involvement
causing low back pain, and sacroiliitis causing pain in
the buttocks or thighs, which may radiate down the
back of the legs. The pain is typical for inflammatory
pain with associated morning stiffness and improvement on exercise. Progressive spinal fusion and loss of
movement occurs; eventually the patient has a fixed
kyphotic spine, hyperextended neck, spinocranial ankylosis and a reduction in chest expansion, leading to a
‘question mark’ posture (Fig. 36.5). The hips are commonly affected, and other large joints may be involved
in an asymmetrical distribution. Peripheral joints may
also be affected, and dactylitis (causing ’sausage digits’)
is sometimes a feature. Enthesitis (inflammation of tendon insertions) often occurs at the Achilles, the supraspinatus tendon and the costochondral junctions.
Extra-articular features include:
• General malaise.
• Uveitis: in approximately a third of cases.
• Bowel mucosal ulceration (in around 50%, usually
asymptomatic) and inflammatory bowel disease.
• Aortic regurgitation: due to aortitis.
• Respiratory failure: secondary to kyphoscoliosis,
rigidity and apical fibrosis.
• Neurological involvement such as cauda equina syndrome (in long-standing ankylosis), spinal cord
compression (with atlantoaxial subluxation) or
nerve root compression.

Investigations
The diagnosis of AS is made largely on features of the
history and examination. The following investigations
are useful and should be performed:
• ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP): often raised and
may be useful for monitoring.
• HLA-B27: provides useful supporting evidence but it
is also present in the healthy population.
• X-rays: sacroiliitis is indicated by irregular margins
and sclerosis of adjacent bone; in long-standing disease, the classic finding is ‘bamboo’ spine with
squaring of the vertebrae and calcification and ossification of intervertebral ligaments. In early disease
these changes may not be present and MRI/CT
may be useful if the diagnosis is not clear.

349

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders

Management
Treatment includes analgesia with NSAIDs. Patients
should be encouraged to exercise to prevent deformity,
maintain movement and relieve symptoms. Sulfasalazine improves symptoms due to peripheral arthritis
and morning stiffness; methotrexate is not effective in
AS. TNF inhibitors have been shown to be effective
and are used in severe disease. Although the majority
of patients will be able to maintain a normal lifestyle,
the prognosis is variable. The disease may be progressive, it may remit, or there may be recurrent episodes.
In extreme cases, respiratory function may be impaired
because of immobility of the spine and ribcage.

Reactive arthritis
Reactive arthritis occurs several days to weeks after
enteritis or urethritis due to particular causative organisms, mainly Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Shigella
or Chlamydia trachomatis. When it occurs with non-specific
urethritis (NSU) and conjunctivitis, and was formerly referred to as Reiter’s syndrome. It usually affects young
adults and is around 10 times more common in men than
women, though this may be partly due to underdiagnosis.

Clinical features
The arthritis is often of acute onset, oligoarticular and
asymmetrical, particularly affecting the lower limbs. It
may be associated with non-articular inflammatory lesions, including plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinitis.
Other clinical features include:

Fig. 36.5 Advancing ankylosing spondylitis. Eventually the
trunk may become fixed in a fully flexed position, so that
the patient cannot see directly ahead – the classic ‘question
mark’ posture.

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember the extra-articular ‘A’s complicating
ankylosing spondylitis:
• Apical fibrosis.
• Aortic regurgitation.
• Aortitis.
• Anterior uveitis.
• Achilles tendonitis and other enthesitides.
• Amyloidosis.

350

• Urethritis: associated with penile discharge and dysuria. There may be circinate balanitis (an erythematous circular lesion on the glans with a pale centre).
• Conjunctivitis: usually mild and bilateral; iritis and
anterior uveitis may also occur.
• Mouth ulcers.
• Keratoderma blennorrhagica: a pustular hyperkeratotic lesion on the soles of the feet.
• Nail dystrophy and subungual keratosis.
• General malaise and low-grade fever.
• Cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological complications are rare.

Investigations
The diagnosis is clinical and common autoantibodies
are negative. Joint aspiration may help exclude septic
and crystal arthritis. Evidence of the triggering infection
should be sought with urine and faecal culture and urethral swabs, although these are often negative. HLA-B27
is positive in 60% of patients. X-rays do not aid the
diagnosis of reactive arthritis.

Crystal arthropathy

Management
Treatment is symptomatic with analgesia (e.g. NSAIDs)
and rest of affected joints. Painful effusions can be aspirated. Intra-articular or systemic steroids can be used in
the acute phase, but if sustained treatment is needed sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be helpful. In most
cases, the acute arthritis settles within 1–2 months; mild
symptoms may persist for 6–12 months, but less than
10% develop chronic disease.

36

with high alcohol intake, hypertensives and the overweight. About a third have a positive family history.
The underlying biochemical abnormality is an overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid resulting
in hyperuricaemia. The main causes are given in
Fig. 36.6.

Clinical features
Acute gout

Psoriatic arthritis
This is a seronegative arthritis occurring in 10–15% of
patients with psoriasis; in a minority of patients it
precedes the skin condition. There are 5 clinical subtypes: distal arthritis alone, symmetrical polyarthritis
(RA-like), axial arthritis (AS-like), asymmetrical oligoarthritis and arthritis mutilans. Distal arthritis is often
considered the most specific feature and is probably
the most common presenting pattern. However, the
subtypes are not clear-cut, and over time the pattern
may change in the same patient. There is nail pitting
and onycholysis. Pitting oedema is sometimes present,
and as with other seronegative arthritides enthesitis,
dactylitis and eye signs may occur.
Radiology shows marginal erosions with new bone
formation. Treatment is with analgesia and antiinflammatory drugs. DMARDs and anti-TNF therapies
may be effective and are used in severe cases.

Enteropathic arthropathies
These occur in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and usually affect the knees and ankles as a monoarthritis or asymmetrical oligoarthritis. Spondylitis
and socroiliitis may occur. The aetiology is unknown,
but the breakdown of mucosal integrity and subsequent exposure to multiple enteric bacteria may cause
expansion of self-directed lymphocytes. Management
should be aimed at the underlying bowel disease,
which will usually improve the arthritis. NSAIDs and
joint aspiration will provide symptomatic relief. In severe cases immunomodulatory treatment is sometimes
required.

CRYSTAL ARTHROPATHY

Gout
Gout is a result of the deposition of sodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissues due to an abnormality of
uric acid metabolism, affecting approximately 1 in
500 people in the UK. The risk is greater in men, those

The initial attack is typically in the first metatarsophalangeal joint with an acute onset of a red, hot, swollen,
extremely painful big toe. It may be precipitated by alcohol, diet, starvation, diuretics or after surgery. A minority of patients have a polyarticular initial attack. In
recurrent episodes other commonly affected areas include the ankle, wrist, knees and bursae. The patient
may have high blood pressure, renal impairment or peripheral vascular disease. The renal disease may be secondary to uric acid stones.
COMMUNICATION
Patients with acute gout will often graphically describe
the severity of their discomfort. It is a very painful
condition.

Chronic tophaceous gout
In this stage of disease, which is now less frequent with
effective treatment, there are deposits of urate in connective tissues, often visible on the helix of the ear or
around joints (particularly hands and elbows). This
causes joint erosion and disruption, leading to chronic
arthritis and disability.

Fig. 36.6 Causes of gout.

Idiopathic
Drugs: diuretics, low-dose aspirin
Chronic renal impairment
Hypertension
Primary hyperparathyroidism
Hypothyroidism
Alcohol
Glucose-6-phosphate deficiency
Rapid cell turnover or destruction:
Myeloproliferative disorders, e.g. polycythaemia
rubra vera
Lymphoproliferative disorders, e.g. leukaemia
Severe psoriasis
Tumour lysis syndrome, e.g. with initiation of
chemotherapy

351

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders

Investigations
The following investigations are important in patients
with gout:
• Joint aspiration is the definitive test and helps
exclude septic arthritis in the single hot swollen
joint. Synovial fluid examined under polarized light
microscopy shows needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals.
• X-rays may be normal in acute gout but show
punched-out erosions and joint disruption in
chronic gout.
• Serum uric acid may be high but there are a large
number of false-positive and false-negative results.
It is more useful for monitoring treatment.
• White cell count, CRP and ESR may be mildly raised
in an acute attack.

Management
Acute attacks
These are normally treated with high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as
naproxen 500 mg b.d. or ibuprofen 400 mg t.d.s.
They should be used with care in patients with peptic
ulcer disease, heart failure, hypertension and renal
impairment.
When NSAIDs are contraindicated, colchicine can be
used and is probably as effective, but often causes diarrhoea. If neither colchicine nor NSAIDs can be tolerated, steroids may be used. Intra-articular injection of
steroid into an affected joint often provides symptomatic relief.

Prophylactic treatment
The patient should be advised on weight reduction, reducing alcohol consumption, avoiding precipitating
foods such as red meat and avoiding precipitating drugs
if possible.
If the patient has recurrent attacks, tophi, a documented
state of uric acid overproduction (e.g. myeloproliferative
disease) or renal disease, uric-acid-lowering drug therapy
is indicated. The initiation of treatment may precipitate
an acute attack; therefore, colchicine or NSAIDs should
be used prophylactically for at least 1 month after the
hyperuricaemia has been corrected. Uric acid lowering
drugs should not be started during an acute attack.
Allopurinol and febuxostat inhibit xanthine oxidase,
which catalyses the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and of xanthine to uric acid. Allupurinol is the
first-line treatment for prevention of gout, and is usually
given once daily (initially 100 mg after food) and gradually increased to a maintenance dose of about 300 mg
daily. Lower doses are given in patients with renal impairment. It may cause skin rashes.

352

Uricosuric drugs include probenecid and sulphinpyrazone. They may be used in patients with normal renal function when allopurinol is not tolerated. Aspirin
antagonizes the effect of uricosuric drugs. They may lead
to crystallization of urate in the urine and formation of
urate stones, particularly in patients with disease of
urate overproduction.
Rasburicase, a synthetic uricase which converts urate
to allantoin, is used for prevention of gout and urate nephropathy in patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome
during chemotherapy.

Pseudogout
This is also known as calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate
arthropathy and risk factors include old age, hyperparathyroidism, haemochromatosis, hypothyroidism and
low phosphate or magnesium levels.
Acute attacks present with a monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, usually affecting the knees, hips or wrists, in contrast to gout. It is usually self-limiting and can be
precipitated by an intercurrent illness. Chronic disease
causes joint changes similar to osteoarthritis (but more
severe) and may cause a polyarthritis.
Joint aspiration demonstrates the presence of crystals
that are weakly positively birefringent in polarized light,
and X-rays may reveal chondrocalcinosis in affected
joints. Management is symptomatic with NSAIDs or
colchicine and therapeutic joint aspiration. Intraarticular steroid injections are often helpful, and in
chronic disease hydroxychloroquine can be considered.
Any predisposing underlying conditions should be
treated.

SYSTEMIC LUPUS
ERYTHEMATOSUS
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem,
autoimmune connective tissue disorder. The prevalence
in the UK is approximately 1 in 1000. It is around nine
times more common in women and also more common
in Asians and Afro-Caribbean people. Median age at onset in white women is between 30 and 50. The aetiology
is unknown but is probably multifactorial; there is evidence of a genetic predisposition and environmental
triggers (e.g. drugs such as hydralazine, ultraviolet light
and viral infections) may have a role.

Clinical features
Common early features include fever, arthralgia, malaise, tiredness and weight loss. There is a huge spectrum
of disease and any of the following systems may be
involved.

Systemic lupus erythematosus

Musculoskeletal system
This is involved in over 90% of cases. Arthralgia is usually symmetrical and migratory. Morning stiffness is
milder than in RA, and examination findings may be
mild compared to the symptoms. Erosive arthritis is
rare. Myalgia and myositis can occur, and rarely there
is a deforming arthropathy due to capsular laxity
(Jaccoud’s arthropathy). Aseptic necrosis affecting the
hip or knee may rarely occur.

36

Seizures.
Strokes.
Peripheral neuropathies.
Headache.
Cognitive dysfunction.

Less common features include cranial nerve lesions
and aseptic meningitis. Neurological involvement is
likely due to vasculopathy, causing ischaemia, or autoantibody-mediated disease.

Skin

Respiratory system

This is involved in approximately 80% of cases. Classically there is a ‘butterfly’ rash over the bridge of the
nose and spreading over both cheeks (Fig. 36.7). Other
features include photosensitivity, alopecia, livedo
reticularis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, nail-fold infarcts,
purpura, urticaria and oral ulceration.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) is a
subtype in which cutaneous symptoms predominate,
although in around 50% of patients other organs are
affected.
Discoid lesions may develop in SLE or may exist
alone as discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). There
are discoid erythematous plaques on the face that progress to scarring and pigmentation; 5–10% of these
patients develop mild systemic disease.

The respiratory system is involved in approximately
50% of cases. Pulmonary manifestations include:

Nervous system
The central nervous system (CNS) is involved in 60% of
cases. Psychiatric disturbances include depression and
occasionally psychosis. Other features include:

• Pleurisy with pleural effusions.
• Pneumonitis.
• Interstitial lung disease and ’shrinking lung syndrome’ (reduced lung volumes but normal imaging).

Renal system
The renal system is involved in approximately 50% of
cases and is associated with a poor prognosis. The patient may present with nephrotic or nephritic syndrome,
hypertension or chronic renal failure. Proteinuria and
haematuria are common. There are six main patterns
of glomerular disease associated with immune complex
deposition. Tubulointerstitial nephritis and renovascular disease may also occur.

Cardiovascular system
The cardiovascular system is involved in 40% of cases.
There may be:
•
•
•
•

Pericarditis with pericardial effusion.
Myocarditis with consequent heart failure.
Aortic valve lesions.
Non-bacterial endocarditis of the mitral valve
(Libman–Sacks endocarditis).

Blood and lymphatic systems
The ESR is markedly raised. There may be:

‘bat’ or ‘butterfly wing’ rash.

Arterial and venous thrombosis. This may be part of
the antiphospholipid syndrome.

353

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders

Investigations
Diagnosis is often made using the American College of
Rheumatology criteria (see Fig. 36.8). The following investigations are important in patients with SLE:
• Inflammatory markers: ESR is raised. CRP is usually
normal.
• There may be anaemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia.
• Renal function, liver function, simple urinalysis and
urine protein/creatinine ratio.
• Antinuclear antibody: positive in almost all cases
(classically a homogeneous pattern) but not specific.
Anti-double-stranded DNA (present in 75%) and
anti-Sm (present in 25%) are more specific. The titres of anti-dsDNA rise in active disease.
• Serum complement levels are often reduced in active
disease. Total immunoglobulins are raised.
• Renal biopsy: if there is involvement of the kidneys,
renal biopsy shows characteristic histological changes, which can predict prognosis and guide
treatment.

Treatment
General advice should be to quit smoking, which may
increase active disease, and avoid sun exposure or use
sunblock. Joint pain, headache or mild serositis can
be managed with NSAIDs in patients with less severe

disease. If necessary, anaemia can be corrected with
transfusion. For acute exacerbations, steroids are given
in high doses and gradually reduced depending on
symptoms, signs and changes in ESR.
Immunosuppressive drugs are used for patients with
more serious disease, such as with renal or CNS involvement, as they have a steroid-sparing effect. Drugs used
include azathioprine, chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide, and there may be a role for the anti-CD20 molecule rituximab.
In some patients in whom NSAIDs are ineffective in
controlling joint pain, or in whom skin manifestations
predominate, the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine may be useful. It can cause retinal degeneration,
so vision should be formally assessed at regular
intervals.

Drug-induced lupus
Drug-induced lupus may occur with hydralazine in
people who are genetically ‘slow acetylators’, and with
procainamide, isoniazid, chlorpromazine and anticonvulsants. It remits when the drug is stopped. Renal and
CNS involvement is rare. Anti-histone antibodies are
present in over 95% of cases.

ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME
This condition manifests as an increased risk of arterial
and venous thromboses and miscarriage in the presence
of antibodies against phospholipid, particularly anticardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant. Lupus
anticoagulant causes a prolonged activated partial
thromboplastin time, hence its name, but in vivo it is
procoagulant. The raised APTT does not correct when
the sample is mixed with normal plasma, but will
normalize when phospholipid is added.
The condition may be primary, when pathogenesis is
thought to be related to prior infection, but is also frequently described in the context of rheumatic disease,
particularly SLE; around 50% of patients with lupus
anticoagulant have SLE. Treatment is specialist and
often requires high levels of anticoagulation.

POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA
AND GIANT CELL ARTERITIS
These inflammatory conditions frequently occur together; around half of patients with giant cell arteritis
(GCA) have polymyalgia. The underlying pathogenic
mechanisms are incompletely understood and may be
common to both conditions.

Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis

36

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)

Treatment

PMR is about three times more common than GCA. It is
a clinical syndrome characterized by proximal muscle
pain and stiffness. The incidence increases with age,
with those under 50 rarely affected, and the prevalence
is as high as 2% in patients aged over 60 years. It is two
to three times more common in women than in men,
more common in northern Europe than in southern
Europe, and is rare in non-whites.

Symptoms almost always improve within a few days
with corticosteroids. The ESR falls to normal within
2–3 weeks and the CRP becomes normal within 1 week.
An initial daily dose of 15–20 mg of prednisolone is
usually adequate to control symptoms. The dose should
be continued for around a month before slowly reducing it while monitoring with follow-up appointments.
There is no indication for prophylactic high-dose steroids to prevent blindness as with giant cell arteritis.
However, patients should be warned to look out for additional symptoms such as headache or blurred vision.
Approximately 50% of patients manage to discontinue steroids within 2 years. Management should be
based on the clinical response, although a rise in ESR
should prompt review. Relapses are most common in
the first year but the incidence falls thereafter, and they
are often associated with a reduction in steroid dose.
Adding an NSAID to cover ache and stiffness may be
of symptomatic help.
In patients who are developing the side effects of
steroids, a ‘steroid-sparing’ immunosuppressant (e.g.
methotrexate) should be considered under expert supervision. Prophylaxis against osteoporosis is usually indicated. In a few patients, it is impossible to withdraw
steroids altogether and it is acceptable to maintain them
indefinitely on prednisolone 2–3 mg/day.

Clinical features
• Pain affecting shoulders (usually the first to be affected), hips and neck, predominantly of muscles.
• Severe morning stiffness that often persists for more
than 1 h.
• Muscle tenderness.
• Acute illness of less than a month’s duration.
• Anorexia and weight loss may be severe.
The distribution tends to be symmetrical, and systemic
features such as sweating, malaise and depression are
common. True weakness does not occur, although
power and range of movement may be limited by pain.
Synovitis may be present though it is usually overshadowed by the muscular symptoms.

Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of PMR includes:
• Late-onset RA or spondyloarthropathy.
• Musculoskeletal: OA, rotator cuff disease, nonspecific back pain, trochanteric bursitis.
• Other neuromuscular conditions, polymyositis and
proximal myopathy.
• Occult malignancy if systemic features are marked.
• Hypothyroidism: due to myalgia and malaise.

Investigations
The following investigations are important in patients
with PMR:
• ESR: usually over 40 mm/h; very high values can occur.
• Acute phase proteins: increased (e.g. CRP).
• Alkaline phosphatase: raised in approximately 30%
of patients.
• A mild normochromic normocytic anaemia is common and platelets tend to be increased.
• Tests to exclude conditions capable of mimicking
PMR: rheumatoid factor, thyroid function tests,
creatine kinase if muscle weakness is suspected
and autoantibodies if there are features suggesting
connective tissue disease.
A temporal artery biopsy is not indicated unless features
of GCA coexist.

Prognosis
The prognosis is good provided the steroid dosage is not
excessive. Most patients can be reassured that treatment
can usually be discontinued after 2–4 years with a low
rate of recurrence thereafter.

Giant cell arteritis
This disease usually occurs in patients over 60 years old
and is very rare before the age of 50. The classical symptoms are of temporal arteritis, causing temporal headache with tender, reddened non-pulsatile arteries. The
headache may be severe and is often worse at night.
Involvement of other cranial arteries may cause a tender
scalp, pain in the jaw during eating (jaw claudication),
skin necrosis or tongue ischaemia. Involvement of the
vertebral arteries may lead to TIA or stroke, and disease
of the ophthalmic arteries may lead to retinal ischaemia
or infarction causing amaurosis fugax, blurred vision or
irreversible blindness. Features of polymyalgia rheumatica (see above) may be present, including systemic
features.

Investigations
The ESR is usually raised, up to 100 mm/h, although a
normal ESR does not exclude the diagnosis. C-reactive

355

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders
protein, platelets and alkaline phosphatase levels are
commonly raised. Temporal artery biopsy is required
to make a definitive diagnosis. ‘Skip lesions’ may lead
to false negatives, and a long biopsy specimen should
be obtained.

Treatment
Treatment is with high doses of prednisolone (60 mg
daily). This relieves the headache within 24 h and averts
the risk of blindness, which occurs in up to 50% of
patients if untreated. The prednisolone is gradually reduced to a maintenance level, and the dose is monitored
by symptoms and serial ESRs. Treatment may have to be
continued for many years, and itself carries a significant
morbidity from side effects.
HINTS AND TIPS
Steroids should never be delayed if GCA is suspected.
Temporal artery biopsy may remain positive for
several weeks after steroids are started.

VASCULITIS

Classification
Vasculitis is a term referring to many different conditions all causing inflammation of blood vessels. Vasculitis may be a primary condition or it may occur in the
context of other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, SLE or infection. The primary vasculitides may be classified according to the size of the vessels
affected (Fig. 36.9).

Aetiology and pathology
The common feature of the vasculitides is the presence
of leucocytes in the vessel wall causing inflammation

of vessel affected.

and ultimately necrosis. This may lead to obstruction
of the vessel and ischaemia, or the vessel may rupture
causing bleeding.
The precise trigger of inflammation remains obscure.
In several of these conditions autoantibodies are
present, particularly anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and it is likely that they play a pathogenic role.

Clinical features
The clinical features of vasculitis vary widely and they
are often difficult to diagnose. They may affect blood
vessels anywhere in the body, often causing systemic
symptoms such as fatigue, weakness and fever, as well
as single or multi-organ failure. Features include the
following:
• Skin: purpuric or petechial rash, livedo reticularis.
• Upper airway symptoms (rhinitis, congestion) in
Wegener’s granulomatosis.
• Pulmonary symptoms: cough, haemoptysis, wheeze.
• Myalgia.
• Neurological signs: mononeuritis multiplex, seizures, focal signs.
• Renal involvement: the main cause of death.
Patients may present with hypertension, proteinuria,
an acute nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome or
renal failure.
• Cardiac involvement (PAN or Kawasaki disease):
Coronary arteritis may cause angina and myocardial
infarction. There may be pericarditis.
The combination of renal impairment and pulmonary
haemorrhage suggests ANCA-associated vasculitis
(Wegener’s, MPA) or Goodpasture’s disease.

Investigations
The following tests should be carried out:
• Full blood count, renal and liver function, ESR, creatine kinase.
• Urinalysis  protein–creatinine ratio.
• Autoantibody screen including ANA and complement (lupus) ANCA.
• Chest X-ray and ECG.
A biopsy will often be required to make a definitive
diagnosis. Other tests may be necessary depending on
the organs involved.

Treatment
In some cases of mild vasculitis, for instance when it is
limited to skin involvement or arthralgia, symptomatic
treatment with NSAIDs may be sufficient. This is particularly true of Henoch–Schönlein purpura, of which
the majority of cases are self-limiting. However, a

36

Other connective tissue disorders
significant minority of patients develop renal involvement and monitoring is extremely important.
In other vasculitides, some form of immunomodulatory treatment is usually required due to the risk of progression and irreversible organ damage. This is usually
in the form of high-dose corticosteroids at first, though
resistant disease may require additional immunosuppression in the form of cyclophosphamide. In the
ANCA-associated vasculitides both therapies are started
simultaneously to obtain rapid control of the disease.
Kawasaki disease is treated with IV immunoglobulin.
Prognosis varies according to the form of vasculitis.
Aggressive ANCA-associated vasculitis or PAN carries a
5-year mortality of up to 90% if untreated. Most patients
respond well to therapy, but 5-year mortality may
still be as high as 30%.

Behçet’s disease
This is a recurrent progressive multisystem disease of
unknown aetiology. It is thought that most features
are due to vasculitis, and all sizes of blood vessel are involved. Painful ulceration of the oral and genital regions
is common. Other features of Behçet’s disease may
include:
• Skin lesions: nodules, pustules, erythema nodosum.
• Eyes: uveitis, hypopyon, retinal vasculitis.
• Vessels: aneurysms and venous thrombosis in large
vessels.
• Joints: seronegative arthritis.
• CNS complications: brainstem syndromes, meningoencephalitis.
• GI tract: pain, nausea, diarrhoea mimicking inflammatory bowel disease.

cutaneous (LSSc) types, depending on the degree of skin
involvement. Very rarely it may occur without skin involvement, when it is termed ’systemic sclerosis sine
scleroderma’. LSSc may show the characteristic features
of CREST syndrome (Fig. 36.10).

Clinical features
There is general malaise, lassitude, fever and weight loss.
The following systems may be involved.

Skin
The previous term for systemic sclerosis was scleroderma, reflecting the thickening and hardening of the
skin associated with increased collagen content. In LSSc
skin involvement is limited to the hands, forearms, face
and neck; involvement of other areas is indicative of
DSSc. Patients classically have a beaked nose, facial telangiectasia and tight skin around the mouth causing
difficulty in opening the mouth wide (Fig. 36.11).
The skin becomes smooth, waxy and atrophic with pigmentation or depigmentation. There may be digital

Calcinosis cutis
Raynaud’s syndrome
oEsophageal involvement
Sclerodactyly
Telangiectasia

Treatment is with steroids for ulcers and systemic features. In resistant cases colchicine or cytotoxic drugs
(e.g. azathioprine) may be needed.

OTHER CONNECTIVE TISSUE
DISORDERS

Systemic sclerosis
Systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disease that mainly
occurs in middle-aged women. It presents with Raynaud’s phenomenon in more than 75% of cases. The
aetiology is unknown. There may be an association with
certain HLA types. There are abnormalities of both humoral and cellular immunity. Early in the disease, the
skin is oedematous and the blood vessels show arteritis
and thickening. There is an increase in collagen and progressive fibrosis of viscera. The condition may be divided into diffuse cutaneous (DSSc) or limited

Telangiectasia

The skin may also be waxy and shiny.

357

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders
oedema (‘sausage-shaped’ fingers), with subsequent
sclerodactyly. Raynaud’s phenomenon is common
and there may be subcutaneous calcification. Itch may
be prominent.
Morphoea or localized scleroderma is a relatively benign condition affecting only the skin, especially on the
trunk and limbs. Plaques evolve to produce waxy, thickened skin and induration. These may enlarge or new lesions may appear over time. Resolution is associated
with hyperpigmentation. Only rarely does morphoea
proceed to systemic sclerosis.

Gastrointestinal system
Oesophageal involvement is very common. Reduced
peristalsis, dilatation and oesophageal sphincter dysfunction may cause dysphagia or heartburn in about
half of affected patients. Reflux may lead to strictures.
Dilatation and atony of the small bowel can cause bacterial overgrowth with malabsorption and steatorrhoea.

Respiratory system
There is interstitial fibrosis in around 70% of patients,
which predominantly affects the lower lobes of the
lungs but can be diffuse. A restrictive lung defect is seen,
which may progress to respiratory failure. There may be
aspiration pneumonia (due to oesophageal dysmotility) and pulmonary hypertension in advanced disease.

Musculoskeletal system
Polyarthralgia and flexion deformities develop due to fibrosis of tendons. Myopathy and polymyositis can occur.

Cardiovascular system
Myocardial fibrosis can cause arrhythmias and conduction defects. Pericardial effusions and pericarditis can
occur, and right heart failure secondary to pulmonary
hypertension is seen.

Renal system
Subclinical renal involvement is present in up to 80% of
patients. Chronic kidney disease in scleroderma appears
to have a benign prognosis. However, scleroderma renal
crisis occurs in up to 15% due to an obliterative endarteritis of renal vessels, leading to progressive renal failure
and hypertension, which may be fatal.

Eyes
Eyelid and conjunctival abnormalities can occur, and
tear secretion may be reduced.

Investigations
The following investigations may help diagnose systemic sclerosis:
• Antinuclear antibodies: these are present in 80% of
patients (nucleolar pattern in scleroderma; rheumatoid factor is positive in 30%). Anti-centromere antibodies are associated with LSSc, whereas anti-DNA

358

topoisomerase-1 (anti-Scl70) antibodies are associated with DSSc.
• ESR: often raised.
• FBC: may show a normochromic normocytic anaemia or a haemolytic anaemia.
• Hand X-rays: may show calcinosis.
CXR, ECG and urinalysis should be performed, as
should baseline renal function. Further investigation
should be guided by symptoms and initial findings,
for instance barium swallow or oesophageal manometry for reflux.

Management
Treatment is symptomatic (e.g. nifedipine or electrically
heated gloves may help with Raynaud’s phenomenon).
Antacids, proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 antagonists will help relieve heartburn. Physiotherapy
may help when joints are affected, and NSAIDs can be
given for joint pain. Hypertensive renal crises are
emergencies and should be treated aggressively with
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and
optimal supportive care. There is little evidence that immunomodulatory therapy or antifibrotic therapy is of
significant benefit for most patients. However, patients
with widespread skin disease or lung fibrosis may benefit from steroids or other immunosuppressants.

Prognosis
The course of the disease is variable but is usually slowly
progressive. Death usually occurs from lung, renal or cardiac complications. The overall mean 5-year survival is approximately 90%. The prognosis may be better for LSSc.

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
These are inflammatory disorders of muscle, of which the
precise aetiology is unknown. The two conditions share
the histological features of muscle fibre necrosis with regeneration and inflammatory cell infiltrate. However,
there are important differences: dermatomyositis involves the skin, has a greater association with cancer
(up to 15% of cases are associated with an underlying malignancy), and both the distribution and composition of
the inflammatory infiltrate are different. They can occur at
any age, with a peak incidence at around 50 years old,
with women twice as likely to be affected as men. The incidence of associated malignancy increases with age.

Clinical features
The clinical features of polymyositis and dermatomyositis include the following:
• Progressive symmetrical and proximal muscle weakness, usually gradual in onset but occasionally acute.
Muscle wasting in advanced cases.

Muscle pain and tenderness: about 50% of patients.
Fibrosis: flexion deformities of the limbs.
Arthralgia and arthritis: about 50% of patients.
Skin involvement in dermatomyositis: purple ‘heliotrope’ colour around the eyes, and sometimes the
rest of the face, with periorbital oedema; violaceous,
oedematous lesions over the knuckles (Gottron’s
papules); telangiectasia, nail-fold infarcts.
Muscle weakness can affect the oesophagus, leading
to dysphagia.

Lung fibrosis or respiratory muscle weakness, which
may require ventilatory support.
Myocarditis: usually mild.
Features of other rheumatic diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome and SLE.

Investigations
• Creatine kinase is almost always raised and can be
used to monitor the disease. A raised CK-MB or troponin can be seen in myocarditis.
• Muscle biopsy: necrosis of muscle fibres with swelling and disruption of muscle cells; fibrosis, thickening of blood vessels and inflammatory changes.
• ESR: usually raised and there may be a normochromic normocytic anaemia.
• Autoantibodies: myositis-specific antibodies, such
as anti Jo-1, may be positive. Antinuclear antibodies
are also often present.
• Investigations for underlying malignancy.
The major differential diagnosis is inclusion body myositis, which is usually asymmetric and distal. A muscle
biopsy will usually distinguish the two.

Management

mouth). It can be primary or secondary if associated
with a connective tissue disorder (commonly RA). There
is an association with certain HLA class II types. Other
exocrine glands may be involved. Systemic manifestations include:
• Arthralgia, polyarthritis, myalgia.
• Raynaud’s phenomenon, vasculitis and other skin
involvement.
• Renal involvement in 20% of patients.
• Pulmonary: fibrotic lung disease, usually mild.
• Parotid gland enlargement in one-third.
• Peripheral neuropathy and focal CNS lesions.
It is associated with other organ-specific autoimmune
diseases (e.g. thyroid disease, vitiligo, pernicious anaemia, primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis). There is an increased risk of lymphoma.

Investigations
The following investigations are important in patients
with Sjögren’s syndrome:
• Anti-Ro and anti-La antibody titres raised. ANA
often present.
• Immunoglobulins: raised.
• Rheumatoid factor: present.
• Schirmer’s test: this is a method of quantifying conjunctival dryness. A strip of filter paper is put under
the lower eyelid and the distance along the paper
that tears are absorbed is measured. This should
be more than 10 mm in 5 min.
• Biopsy of secretory glands shows a lymphocytic and
plasma cell infiltrate of the secretor.

Treatment

High-dose steroids should be prescribed in the acute
phase. The dose can be gradually tapered. Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. methotrexate or azathioprine) may
be required if there is a poor response to steroids. Physiotherapy may help to restore muscle power.

The mainstay of therapy is conservative treatment to
protect the eye and relieve the oral symptoms with artificial saliva and tears. Attempts to modify the progression of the disease have shown little reward, although
newer trials suggest there is a role for anti-B-cell therapies such as rituximab.

Prognosis

Mixed connective tissue disease

The 5-year survival is approximately 80%, but a significant number of those will experience considerable
disability. Lung or heart involvement, high autoantibody titres and underlying malignancy are associated with a poorer outcome.

This is a term used for a condition that combines features of SLE, scleroderma and polymyositis but the
symptoms and signs do not fit neatly into one of
the well-defined syndromes. The features may occur sequentially, and patients may therefore be given another
diagnosis before it is clear that they have MCTD. It
affects women more than men and presents in young
adults. It is associated with high titres of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), often positive in a speckled pattern, and
high titres of antibody to an extractable nuclear antigen
such as ribonucleoprotein. The condition may respond

to steroids. Immunological tests for this disorder and
others are summarized in Fig. 36.12.

Relapsing polychondritis
This is a disorder in which there is inflammation of cartilage and other tissues of unknown aetiology. The ears
and eyes are commonly affected, but the airways, heart
valves, joints and kidneys may also become involved. In
around a third of patients it is associated with vasculitis
or other rheumatic disease. There is a very small evidence base for treatment; steroids or dapsone are often
used before immunosuppressive drugs are tried. Airway
and heart valve involvement may cause early mortality.

SKIN DISEASE

Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects roughly 2% of the population. Psoriasis may present at any age, with a peak incidence in the late 20s,
and affects the sexes equally. It may be triggered by
stress, trauma, infection and drugs (e.g. lithium, chloroquine and beta-blockers), but may also arise in the absence of these.
Evidence suggests that it is an immune-mediated disease with associated hyperproliferation of keratinocytes.
Pathologically, an immune cell infiltrate containing
cells of both the adaptive and innate immune system

360

can be seen in the epidermis, and there is epidermal
thickening with increased numbers of epidermal cells.

Clinical features
The lesions in psoriasis are typically clearly marginated,
salmon-pink plaques topped by a silvery scale, most frequently found over the extensor surfaces of the limbs
(e.g. elbows and knees). They may be severely itchy. Involvement of the scalp with a thickened hyperkeratotic
scale is also common. Plaques may vary in size and
shape and can be discoid, serpiginous or circinate
(ring-like). In extreme cases, erythroderma may occur.
Removal of the scales leaves pinpoint bleeding sites
(Auspitz’s sign), and Köbner’s phenomenon is seen
(i.e. it lesions arise at sites of trauma). Various less common forms have been described as follows:
• Guttate psoriasis: an eruption of small psoriatic lesions over the entire body; it typically occurs after
streptococcal pharyngitis.
• Flexural psoriasis: lesions have a pinkish, glazed appearance, are clearly demarcated and are non-scaly.
The commonest sites of involvement are the groin,
perianal and genital regions and inframammary folds.
• Pustular psoriasis: affects the palms or soles, with
well-demarcated scaling and erythema. The pustules
are white, yellow, green or brown when dried.
Extradermal manifestations include nail involvement
(pitting and onycholysis) in 25% and some form of
arthropathy in 10% of patients with psoriasis. The condition is usually chronic but flares and remission may
be seen.

Skin disease

Management

Eczema/dermatitis

For mild conditions, treatment other than reassurance
and an emollient may be unnecessary. In more troublesome cases topical therapy can be highly effective; different therapies may need to be tried to see what suits
the patient. Systemic therapy is used only if topical treatments are inadequate.

The terms eczema and dermatitis are often used interchangeably, and refer to non-specific inflammation
of the skin. It can be broadly separated into cases
occurring due to an external factor (e.g. contact dermatitis) and those occurring endogenously (e.g. atopic,
seborrhoeic). Clinically, lesions are often vesicular, rupturing to leave a raw, weeping surface. They may be diffuse, irritating and sometimes painful. Itch is common
and often severe, and secondary infection may occur.
With chronicity, lesions become scaly, thickened and
pigment is lost.

Topical therapy
Corticosteroids applied topically are rapidly effective,
and are often used as first-line treatment, but rarely induce long-term remission and lead to skin atrophy with
chronic use. Salicylic acid is useful as an adjunct to
remove surface scale. Side effects include irritation or
toxicity when large areas are treated. Coal tar has both
anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties but
use is limited by its unpleasant appearance and odour,
and it should not be used on the face due to irritation.
However, when the lesions are extensive, coal tar baths
are useful. Dithranol is very effective in psoriasis but
can cause severe skin irritation and should therefore
be started at low concentrations and gradually built
up. Topical vitamin D derivatives such as calcipotriol
are effective for mild-to-moderate psoriasis and do
not have an unpleasant odour; hypercalcaemia is a rare
complication. Tazarotene is a topical retinoid which is
useful as an adjunct to other agents in mild-to-moderate
plaque psoriasis. Many of these drugs are formulated as
shampoos for scalp psoriasis.

Systemic therapy
Ultraviolet B radiation therapy alone is helpful in mildto-moderate, guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis. If unsuccessful, photochemotherapy using psoralens with
long-wave ultraviolet A irradiation (PUVA) is effective
in some patients. Special lamps are required and
short-term side effects include burning; in the long term
there may be cataract formation, accelerated ageing of
the skin (solar elastosis) and increased risk of skin cancer. Acitretin is a retinoid (vitamin A derivative) given
orally for severe resistant or complicated psoriasis. It
is valuable combined with UV therapy. Side effects
can include cracked lips, hair thinning, pruritus, paronychia and nose bleeds, and it is teratogenic. Cytotoxic
drugs (e.g. methotrexate and ciclosporin) can be used
for severe resistant psoriasis. They are for use only by
specialists. If disease does not respond to these, biological agents including anti-TNF (etanercept, infliximab)
and anti-IL-12/IL-23 (ustekinumab) therapies can be
used. Fumaric acid has been used in Germany for many
years and may be as effective as methotrexate; further
trials are awaited.

Classification
Atopic eczema
This affects around 10% of the population. It usually
starts in infancy, and although the majority experience
significant improvement or clearing of the condition by
adulthood, the skin may remain sensitive to irritants
throughout life. It is thought that the barrier function
of the skin is impaired, allowing irritant substances to
penetrate and activate immune cells. In infants there
are exudative, crusted, itchy areas over extensor surfaces
and cheeks. By childhood and adulthood the lesions
are more localized and seen on the antecubital and
popliteal fossae, face, neck, wrists and ankles. There is
pruritus, with skin thickening and increased markings.
Investigations include prick tests to common allergens,
and raised serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). It may be
associated with asthma and hay fever.

Contact dermatitis
Irritant contact dermatitis: the hands are the most common affected site. There is erythema, vesiculation and
fissuring. Irritants include detergents, bleaches and
soaps. Risk is increased in certain occupations (e.g. hairdressers and engineers).
Allergic contact dermatitis: this is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction which requires previous sensitization,
which may occur after one episode of contact or slowly
over years. Patch testing produces a marked, prolonged
response even to dilute quantities of the allergen. The
pattern of eczema depends on the site of contact and
there is often a sharp cut-off where contact ends, although spread to other sites may occur. Thin, moist skin
is the most vulnerable. Common allergens include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dyes.
Nickel: buttons and zips.
Chromates: cement and leather.
Cosmetics: fragrances, preservatives.
Rubber.
Resins: glues.
Plants.
Topical antibiotics.

361

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders
Seborrhoeic dermatitis
Seborrhoeic dermatitis in adults manifests as a scaly,
crusty, red, itchy eruption with yellowish scales, appearing on oily areas of the skin (e.g. the face, flexures and
scalp (dandruff)).

Other subtypes
• Discoid eczema: in this form there are itchy, vesicular, round lesions distributed over the body.
• Dyshidrotic eczema: also known as pompholyx, this
is an extremely itchy, vesicular dermatitis affecting
palms, soles and fingers.

Management
Where possible, the cause should be established and removed, although in practice this may be very difficult. A
patient with suspected contact dermatitis should be
patch-tested to establish the diagnosis. Atopic eczema
usually requires the regular application of an emollient
with short courses of a mild-to-moderate topical corticosteroid, the least potent that is effective. In more severe
eczema, more potent steroids may be needed, and if itching is a major problem consideration should be given to
the administration of antihistamines. Secondary infection is common and should be promptly treated. In severe, resistant atopic dermatitis, systemic steroids may
be used, or ciclosporin if steroid therapy fails.
For dry, fissured, scaly lesions, treatment is with emollients and emulsifying ointment as soap substitutes. For
weeping eczema, treatment is with topical corticosteroids, wet dressings of potassium permanganate, and topical antibacterials. Coal tar is used occasionally in chronic
atopic eczema. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is treated with
medicated shampoo, antifungals and topical steroids.

Acne vulgaris
This is a papulopustular inflammatory condition, usually affecting the face and trunk, which affects approximately 90% of adolescents. Whilst usually mild and
short-lived, it can persist into adulthood and may be severely disfiguring and psychologically damaging. There
is increased keratinization of the sebaceous duct leading
to blockage, increased production of sebum, and colonization by Propionibacterium acnes. These events cause
the primary lesion, the comedo, which may be open
(blackhead) or closed (whitehead). They often become
inflamed, forming papules, pustules or cysts. Healing
can leave residual scarring.

Management
A sympathetic approach is needed; dispel myths that the
patient is dirty or that acne is caused by eating chocolate
or greasy food. Advise on washing the face with soap

362

and water frequently to degrease the skin, but to avoid
rubbing the skin roughly. Topical treatments include
benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, azelaic acid or salicylic
acid, all of which will reduce comedones. Benzoyl
peroxide also has antibacterial action and is useful
for inflamed lesions. In mild-to-moderate acne with
inflammation, topical or oral antibiotics (courses
up to 6 months) such as erythromycin or tetracyclines
are effective.
COMMUNICATION
Even mild acne can be a distressing condition for young
people and requires a sympathetic approach often
involving other family members.

Isotretinoin is a retinoid used for severe acne unresponsive to systemic antibiotics, and acts primarily by reducing sebum secretion. It is teratogenic and has other side
effects including dry mouth and myalgia. In females,
hormone manipulation with antiandrogens and ethinylestradiol can be highly effective and an alternative to
isotretinoin.

Herpes simplex
More than 80% of adults have serological evidence of
prior herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection,
usually from childhood. It is the cause of the cold sore,
herpes labialis. HSV-2 is more commonly associated
with genital herpes. Primary infection is usually asymptomatic; following this the virus survives latent in cell
bodies of nerve ganglia. Reactivation, which may occur
in times of stress, causes a burning, stinging neuralgia,
which precedes or accompanies the development of lesions. These take the form of small groups of vesicles
with an erythematous base in orolabial and genital
areas. Diagnosis is clinical but vesicular fluid or scrapings can show HSV. Treatment is with topical, oral or
IV aciclovir or oral valaciclovir. Herpes simplex may
cause an encephalitis (see Ch. 34), and in immunocompromised patients disseminated HSV infection may
occur.

Herpes (varicella) zoster
Primary infection with HZV causes chickenpox (varicella), usually in childhood; if occurring in adulthood
it may be severe. There is fever and a widespread vesiculopapular rash. Following recovery the virus lies
dormant in the dorsal root ganglia until immunosuppression or illness causes reactivation, termed shingles.
Typically, dermatomal pain and paraesthesia precede
the appearance of maculopapular then vesicular lesions

36

Skin disease
restricted to that dermatome. Shingles is usually thoracic or in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal
nerve. Disseminated herpes can cause shingles in a
non-dermatomal distribution. Diagnosis is clinical,
although analysis of vesicular fluid or scrapings can
demonstrate herpes zoster. If ophthalmic, or in an
immunosuppressed host, then treatment with IV aciclovir is indicated. Oral antivirals, if started within 72 h of
symptoms, will aid healing and reduce post-herpetic
neuralgia. Corticosteroids may help acute pain but do
not prevent post-herpetic neuralgia, which is best treated with amitritpyline, gabapentin or carbamazepine.
It may prove difficult to control and specialist advice
should be sought. The patient may be isolated until
non-infectious (when the lesions crust after 7–10 days),
and certain groups such as the immunocompromised,
pregnant women or healthcare workers without previous infection should avoid contact.

Lichen planus
This mainly affects middle-aged adults. The cause is unknown but may be related to disturbances of immune
function. Lichen-planus-like reactions occur with
certain drugs, such as sulphonamides, sulphonylureas,
methyldopa, thiazides, beta-blockers and drugs that
alter immune function (e.g. antimalarials, gold salts,
penicillamine).
The lesions are purple, polygonal and planar or
flat-topped papules, with a largely peripheral and
symmetrical distribution. Scarring occurs with chronic
disease. Linear lesions may follow trauma or scratching
(Köbner’s phenomenon). Lesions may occur on the buccal mucosa or in the nails. The presence of Wickham’s
striae (fine white lacy lines coursing over the papule)
helps to distinguish the disease. Post-inflammatory
hyperpigmentation is also a useful diagnostic sign.
The lesions usually last for 12–18 months if
untreated. Systemic steroids may be required to suppress intractable itching. Less acute disease can be managed with topical corticosteroids with an antihistamine
at night to control the itching.

Causes of erythema multiforme
• Systemic infections, especially viruses and mycoplasma, account for 90% of cases. Herpes simplex virus is most commonly implicated.
• Drugs (e.g. barbiturates, sulphonamides, penicillin,
salicylates).
• Malignancy.
• Autoimmune rheumatic disease (e.g. RA, SLE).

Stevens–Johnson syndrome and
toxic epidermal necrolysis
These related conditions are severe reactions, usually to
a medication (e.g. allopurinol, antibiotics, antiepileptics) but also to infection or a rarer cause such as vaccination. They are characterized by the acute onset of
fever, skin and mucosal lesions, and skin sloughing.
TEN is the more severe form in which at least 30% of
the skin is sloughed. The mainstay of management is
optimal supportive treatment with attention to nutrition, fluid balance and prevention of infection. The
offending medication should be stopped and any causative infection treated. Steroids are usually given and IV
immunoglobulin may have a role. Mortality in TEN is
up to 35%.

Pemphigus vulgaris and bullous
pemphigoid
These are autoimmune, bullous conditions affecting
mainly people aged over 60. In pemphigus antibodies
are directed against an epidermal cell adhesion molecule, causing flaccid, fragile blisters to develop within
the epidermis. It affects mucosa and skin, with denuded
areas remaining after the blisters rupture. Treatment is
with steroids and immunosuppressive agents.
In pemphigoid, the antibodies affect the basement
membrane, leading to blisters between the dermis and
epidermis. It may occur spontaneously or in response
to medication. The blisters are tense and widespread,
occurring particularly in flexures.

Erythema multiforme
This can present in a variety of ways but the classic lesion is circular with central intensity or blistering giving
a ’target’ appearance. They usually occur on the limbs in
a symmetrical distribution. The lesions may be preceded
by a prodrome of fever, sore throat, headache, arthralgia
and gastroenteritis. When severe, the mucosae may be
involved, and it is termed erythema multiforme major.
Despite significant overlap, there is a move to distinguish this from Stevens–Johnson syndrome (see
below).

Erythema nodosum
This manifests as painful nodular lesions, usually on the
anterior shins, that go through similar colour changes to
a bruise. New crops of lesions emerge while earlier lesions are fading, and it may become necrotic. It is five
times more common in women, with a peak incidence
between 20 and 50 years. The most common causes are
infections, sarcoidosis or drugs, but in a significant proportion of cases no cause is found.

363

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders

Causes of erythema nodosum
• Bacterial infections, esp. Streptococcus spp., tuberculosis, leprosy.
• Sarcoidosis.
• Drugs (e.g. sulphonamides, oral contraceptive pill,
dapsone).
• Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
• Behçet’s disease.
• Viral (e.g. EBV) and fungal (e.g. cocciomycosis)
infections.

Vitiligo
Vitiligo is characteristically well-demarcated, roughly
symmetrical areas of depigmentation. There is loss of
melanocytes, thought to be due to an autoimmune process. Around 30% of cases are associated with organspecific autoimmune disease (e.g. Addison’s, pernicious
anaemia, alopecia, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).

Pyoderma gangrenosum
This presents with violaceous nodules, which then undergo necrosis to produce an ulcer with an overhanging
edge. They heal leaving a scar. There is a clear underlying
cause in around half of cases, such as inflammatory
bowel disease, neoplasia, Wegener’s granulomatosis
and myeloma. Systemic steroids and ciclosporin are
the first-line treatment. Treatment of the underlying disease, if present, often results in healing of the ulcers.

SKIN MANIFESTATIONS OF
SYSTEMIC DISEASE
Systemic disease often involves the skin, ranging from
the life-threatening purpuric rash of meningococcal septicaemia, which must not be missed, to rare lesions providing clues to a diagnosis. The following is a small
selection; many other diseases (e.g. chronic liver disease) have skin signs, which have been highlighted in
the relevant chapters.

Inflammatory bowel disease
Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are causes
of erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum.
Crohn’s is associated with aphthous ulceration and
perianal skin tags, fistulae or abscesses.

Diabetes mellitus
Skin manifestations include recurrent infections, ulcers,
necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (shiny areas on the
shins with a yellowish colour and telangiectasia),

364

granuloma annulare (purplish annular lesions with
the skin surface remaining intact) and fat necrosis at
the site of injections.

Coeliac disease
Coeliac disease is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. There are symmetrical clusters of pruritic urticarial
lesions, particularly in the gluteal region and extensor
aspects of the elbows and knees. They progress to vesicles and bullae. Direct immunofluorescence shows
granular deposits of IgA along the dermal papillae.
Treatment is with dapsone.

Hyperthyroidism
Pretibial myxoedema is seen in Graves’ disease. There is
skin thickening over the shins due to glycosaminoglycan deposition.

Neoplasia
There are many skin manifestations of internal malignancy, including the following:
• Acanthosis nigricans (especially with gastric carcinoma): areas of pigmented rough thickening of
the skin in the axillae or groin with warty lesions.
• Dermatomyositis.
• Erythema gyratum repens: a rare ‘wood grain’ erythema associated with lung cancer.
• Secondary skin metastases.
• Acquired ichthyosis: dry, scaly skin, associated with
lymphoma.
• Thrombophlebitis migrans (especially with pancreatic carcinoma): successive crops of tender nodules
affecting superficial veins throughout the body.

Sarcoidosis
Erythema nodosum may occur. Granulomatous inflammation of the skin (cutaneous sarcoid) may manifest as
papules, nodules, plaques or lupus pernio (a diffuse
bluish plaque with small papules affecting the nose).

Rheumatic fever
This may cause erythema marginatum, round erythematous lesions with central clearing. They may come and
go over hours.

Neurofibromatosis
This condition is autosomal dominant and may include
the following features:
• Café au lait spots (light brown macules).
• Axillary freckling.

Skin infection
• Violaceous dermal neurofibromata.
• Subcutaneous nodules.

Lyme disease (borreliosis)
The classical rash is erythema chronicum migrans,
which starts off as a small red papule before slowly enlarging to form a ring with a raised border. It lasts for 2
days to 3 months. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia
burgdorferi, a spirochaete spread by ticks from deer.
Within the UK, it is most common in the New Forest.
Other features include malaise, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, CNS abnormalities (e.g. meningitis and peripheral neuropathies) and cardiac disease including
conduction disturbances and myocarditis. Treatment
is with doxycycline, penicillin or a third-generation
cephalosporin (e.g. cefotaxime).

Hyperlipidaemia
Tendon xanthomata are associated with familial
hypercholesterolaemia. Eruptive xanthomata occur with
greatly elevated serum lipid concentrations. Xanthelasmata are yellow plaques commonly found on the eyelids which may indicate hyperlipidaemia.

SKIN TUMOURS

Basal cell carcinoma
This is the most common skin tumour and is frequently
seen in elderly, fair-skinned people. Lesions mainly occur on the face, especially at the side of the nose or in the
periorbital skin. There are several subtypes. Nodular
BCC is the most common, and is flesh-coloured with
a pearly, rolled edge. Dilated blood vessels can be seen
over the surface, and central ulceration often occurs
(causing a ’rodent ulcer’). Superficial BCC occurs
mainly on the trunk, and is a mildly erythematous lesion with scale and ’micropapules’ at the border. Other
forms, which may be more aggressive, are less common.
Any type of BCC may produce pigment. They tend to be
locally invasive, but metastases are very rare. Treatment
is by surgical excision, cryotherapy or radiotherapy.

Squamous cell carcinoma
This tumour arises from the epidermis or skin appendages and is most commonly seen on damaged or
chronically irritated skin, especially areas of sun exposure. It is invasive and can metastasize, although this is
rare (less than 1%). Long-term sun exposure is the
most important aetiological factor. Azathioprine
therapy is also strongly linked to SCC development.
Tumours are often hyperkeratotic, crusted and indurated, and may ulcerate. Other variants include SCC

36

in situ (Bowen’s disease), a slow-growing, scaly patch
with a well-defined border. Carcinoma may develop
in long-standing venous ulceration; when this occurs
it is termed a Marjolin’s ulcer. Keratoacanthoma is a
rapidly growing differentiated tumour with a central
core of keratin; although they usually resolve spontaneously with scarring, they are histologically similar
to SCC and around 6% progress to SCC.
Treatment of SCC is by excision or radiotherapy.

Malignant melanoma
HINTS AND TIPS
Sites of malignant melanoma with a poor prognosis are
BANS: Back of the Arm, Neck and Scalp.

This tumour is increasing in incidence and occurs particularly in fair-skinned people with exposure to sunlight.
It is a major cause of cancer in young people. Some melanomas arise in pre-existing moles. There are four types:
superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna and
acral lentiginous. Properties that help identify malignant melanoma are as follows:
•
•
•
•

Rapid enlargement.
Diameter >7 mm.
Bleeding or crusting.
Increasing variegated pigmentation, particularly
blue–black or grey.
• An indistinct border or irregular border.
• Sensory change.
• Small ‘satellite’ lesions around the principal lesion.
The prognosis is related to the depth of the tumour
assessed histologically (Breslow thickness). The 5-year
survival for patients with a tumour <1 mm thick is
more than 90%. If the thickness is >3 mm, the 5-year
survival rate is around 60%. Metastasis is common, particularly to lung, liver and brain. The prognosis is worst
for lesions on the scalp or neck.

Management
Prevention is important, with avoidance of exposure to
direct sunlight and use of effective sunscreen lotions.
Self-examination should be practised, and people should
be aware of the warning signs and symptoms listed above.
Treatment is by excision with skin grafting if necessary.
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used for palliation.

SKIN INFECTION

Cellulitis
This is skin infection involving the dermis and subcutaneous fat, manifesting as erythematous, warm,

365

Musculoskeletal and skin disorders
oedematous areas. The lower limb is the most common
site but it may occur anywhere. Systemic features of infection, such as fever, tachycardia and hypotension,
may occur in more severe, rapidly progressing cellulitis.
Predisposing factors include breaks in the skin (e.g. due
to trauma, ulcers or drug use), fungal foot infection, oedema, diabetes and immunosuppression. The most
common causative organisms are Staphylococcus aureus
and beta-haemolytic streptococcus species. Treatment
is with antibiotics according to local sensitivities; in severe cases they may need to be given intravenously.
Erysipelas is infection of the upper dermis; the
infected areas are raised and clearly demarcated. The
face is involved more often, and systemic features are
common.

Impetigo
This is superficial skin infection with S. aureus or betahaemolytic streptococcus, usually seen in children. Lesions begin as papules before progressing to vesicles.
These may form bullae, or may break down to form a
thick golden crust. Treatment is with antibiotics.

Necrotizing fasciitis
This invasive infection of the subcutaneous tissues is often caused by group A streptococci, though anaerobic
bacteria may be involved. The skin is often affected but
may be spared. Progression is rapid and unremitting;

366

mortality is around 25%. Treatment is with antibiotics
and surgical debridement.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• What is meant by ‘haematinics’.
• The different types of sickle cell crisis.
• The classification and causes of anaemia.
• The difference between acute and chronic leukaemia.
• What is meant by the Philadelphia chromosome.
• The diagnosis and treatment of multiple myeloma.
• The meaning and importance of ‘B symptoms’.
• The different patterns of bleeding seen in haemophilia and von Willebrand’s disease.
• Inherited conditions associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.

ANAEMIA
Anaemia is a common clinical problem as it may result
from many different pathological processes. The aetiology, clinical evaluation, complications and investigation
policy have been considered in Ch. 29. The general
approach to management is outlined first, and then specific conditions are discussed in detail. Anaemia can be
classified by the size of the red cells seen on microscopy or by the underlying cause (e.g. iron deficiency,
haemolysis).

General approach to management
Discover the underlying cause
Remember that there may be more than one cause of
anaemia in any one patient – this can catch out the unwary! For example, folate deficiency and iron deficiency
may both be present in coeliac disease. In some diseases,
such as rheumatoid arthritis, there are several potential
causes of anaemia (see Ch. 36).

Treat the underlying cause
The anaemia will recur if the underlying problem persists (e.g. peptic ulceration, colonic neoplasm).

Correct the anaemia
The method of correction will depend on the type of
anaemia and presence of complications. In general,
iron, vitamin B12 and folate should only be prescribed
when the patient has been appropriately investigated
and shown to have a deficiency.

Iron replacement
Oral iron replacement therapy (e.g. ferrous sulphate)
should be continued for 3 months after the haemoglobin returns to normal to replace iron stores. However, in
patients who have deficiency due to chronic bleeding
this may mask further blood loss. Side effects include
nausea, diarrhoea or constipation, and abdominal pain.
The stools usually become very dark or black. If side effects occur, the dose can be reduced or the preparation
changed, for instance to ferrous gluconate. IM or IV iron
can be given but only if there is poor patient compliance
with oral therapy, severe gastrointestinal disturbance
with oral therapy, malabsorption or in specific situations such as patients on dialysis and some cancer
patients.

Vitamin B12 replacement
Most causes of vitamin B12 deficiency are due to malabsorption and so vitamin B12 is given by IM injection in
the form of hydroxocobalamin. Initially it is given every
other day for 2 weeks to replace stores. Maintenance
dosing is every 3 months and is usually lifelong.

Folate replacement
Oral folic acid corrects anaemia and replaces stores
(a higher dose may be needed in malabsorption states).
Lower-dose oral folic acid should be given as prophylaxis against neural tube defects to women prior
to conception and throughout the first 12 weeks of
pregnancy.
There is a complex relationship with cancer; trials
have raised the possibility of a slightly increased risk

367

Haematological disorders
of cancer with long-term treatment, and some rare tumours are folate dependent. It should be given only
when there is a definite indication. It should not be
given alone in megaloblastic anaemia unless vitamin
B12 status has been shown to be normal, as although
it will partially normalize the anaemia of vitamin B12
deficiency, the neurological sequelae will continue to
worsen and may be precipitated.
COMMUNICATION
Make sure patients are clear that over-the-counter
preparations do not contain sufficient iron for
replacement and that replacement must continue for at
least 3 months to replace iron stores.

Splenectomy
Splenectomy is useful in hereditary spherocytosis and
refractory autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Other indications for splenectomy include trauma, refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and symptomatic
splenomegaly (e.g. myelofibrosis, lymphoma and leukaemia). Complications of splenectomy include thrombocytosis and increased susceptibility to infection with
encapsulated bacteria (mainly pneumococcus, meningococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type B). Patients should be
immunized with vaccines against these organisms. Lifelong daily penicillin for prophylaxis is often started
post-splenectomy, but this practice may decrease with
increasingly resistant bacteria; patients can also be given
antibiotics to have on standby in case of fever.

Blood transfusion

Erythropoietin

Blood is given as packed red blood cells (red cell concentrate, RCC) which have been separated from whole
blood. In an emergency, where time does not allow
cross-matching, O RhD-negative blood can be given
safely. Most labs can provide group-matched blood
within about 30 min; fully cross-matched blood takes
longer. Regular blood transfusion may be necessary in
chronic anaemia which is not corrected by supplements. Fig. 37.1 summarizes the complications of
transfusion.

Recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) has revolutionized
the management of the anaemia associated with
chronic renal failure. It is given up to three times a week
as subcutaneous or IV injections. Adequate iron stores
are needed and it is less effective in inflammatory states.
It is also approved for treatment of chemotherapyinduced anaemia in certain situations.
Complications include hypertension and a rare pure
red cell aplasia associated with anti-EPO antibodies.
Incidence has decreased with newer agents.

Fig. 37.1 Complications of blood transfusion.

Complication

Cause

Haemolytic reaction

ABO incompatibility (acute, severe), extravascular haemolysis (delayed by 3 days to
3 weeks, mild/clinically silent)

Anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity to plasma proteins

Febrile reaction

Antibodies to white cells

Volume overload

Particularly the elderly and in megaloblastic anaemia

Coagulopathies

Platelets and clotting factors are reduced by a dilutional effect in massive transfusion

Infection

Virus (HIV, hepatitis B and C, EBV, CMV), Gram-negative bacteria (uncommon)

Haemosiderosis

With repeated transfusions

Alloimmunization

Antibodies may develop to red cells, leucocytes, platelets and plasma proteins despite
receiving compatible blood; this may cause problems the next time the patient
receives a transfusion

Graft-versus-host disease

Uncommon: preventable by using irradiated blood (important in transplant recipients)

Air embolism

Particularly if given via central lines

Thrombophlebitis

At cannula site

TRALI (transfusionassociated lung injury)

Unpredictable, non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema

CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein–Barr virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.

Anaemia

Causes of anaemia
Some specific causes of anaemia are outlined below. For
an approach to the diagnosis of anaemia and a more extensive list of causes, see Ch. 29.

Anaemia of chronic disease
Aetiology and pathology
Many chronic diseases, particularly infective, inflammatory or malignant processes, are associated with
anaemia. The pathology is multifactorial, with inappropriate utilization of adequate iron stores, reduced
erythropoietin production, reduced response to erythropoietin and reduced RBC survival. It has a different
pathogenesis and treatment to anaemia seen in chronic
renal failure.

Presentation and complications
Presentation is with the typical symptoms and signs of
anaemia, and complications may occur. Signs of the underlying disease may also be present.

Investigations
Characteristic findings are:
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia (may be hypochromic, microcytic).
• Low serum iron but normal/high serum ferritin.
• Increased iron stores in bone marrow.
• Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is low. This helps
differentiate from iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
when TIBC is raised.
• A raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), neutrophilia and thrombocytosis, in addition to the
anaemia, constitutes a ‘reactive’ blood picture
reflecting the primary pathology.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that ferritin is an acute phase protein and
may be misleading in acute illness.

Treatment
• Treat the underlying disease.
• If mild and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary.
• If symptomatic, consider transfusion. EPO is used in
rare cases.

Haemolytic anaemia
There are many different types of haemolytic anaemia,
which may be classified according to whether the disorder is inherited or acquired, and whether the red cell lysis occurs in the peripheral circulation (’intravascular’)
or in the monocyte-macrophage system – the liver,

37

spleen and lymph nodes (’extravascular’). Abnormalities common to all haemolytic anaemias are as follows:
•
•
•
•

Jaundice due to raised unconjugated bilirubin.
Raised reticulocyte count.
Raised lactate dehydrogenase.
Reduced haptoglobin levels.

Abnormalities specific to certain causes of haemolytic
anaemia are outlined in the sections below. Chronic
haemolytic anaemia leads to increased folate requirements, which may not be met, causing a coexistent
folate deficiency picture.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency
This X-linked recessive condition occurs in around 200
million people worldwide; the most severe form occurs
in Mediterraneans. G6PD deficient erythrocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes haemoglobin
to precipitate (Heinz bodies) and haemolysis to occur.
In the most common forms the patient is normally
asymptomatic, with episodes of acute intravascular
and extravascular haemolysis precipitated by infection,
drugs or eating fava beans.
• There is reduced G6PD concentration and activity.
The blood film in an acute episode shows bite cells,
blister cells, Heinz bodies and red cell fragments.
• Treatment is primarily by avoiding precipitants and
treating underlying causes. Transfusion may be required in acute episodes.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency
This recessively inherited enzyme deficiency causes a
chronic extravascular haemolysis of variable severity,
which may be apparent at birth. There is reduced ATP
production. In mild disease, the anaemia is often well
tolerated due to right shift of the oxygen dissociation
curve. Patients may develop complications of chronic
haemolysis such as gallstones, hepatosplenomegaly and
problems associated with iron overload.
• The blood film is often non-specific. Pyruvate kinase
activity is usually low with raised levels of 2,3diphosphoglycerate.
• Treatment is with transfusion when required; splenectomy is usually reserved for severe cases.

Hereditary spherocytosis
This encompasses a number of inherited defects of
membrane proteins, most of which are autosomal dominant, causing reduced deformability of RBCs, membrane loss and extravascular destruction. The severity
is variable, and around 25% of patients have no anaemia
and are not diagnosed until adulthood. However, most
patients present in childhood with a mild-to-moderate
anaemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. Aplastic crisis
can occur in association with viral illness, most

369

Haematological disorders
commonly parvovirus B19. Complications of long-term
haemolysis may develop:
• The blood film shows spherocytes and reticulocytes,
and bone marrow examination reveals a compensatory erythroid hyperplasia. The spherocytes show
increased osmotic fragility on testing.
• Splenectomy should be considered on an individual
patient basis taking into account the severity of the
anaemia and complications. Folate supplementation may be required.
• Hereditary elliptocytosis is an autosomal dominant
condition with a similar but milder presentation to
that of hereditary spherocytosis. Blood film shows elliptical RBCs. Most cases require no treatment but the
severity is variable, and severe forms may also require
splenectomy and folate supplementation.

Sickle cell disease
This is covered below.

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA)
In these acquired conditions haemolysis occurs when
antibodies bind to the cell surface, either inducing
complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis or extravascular destruction. It can be classified according
to the temperature at which the antibodies bind: warm
AIHA, cold agglutinin disease, or mixed.
• Warm AIHA is usually idiopathic but may occur with
infection, other autoimmune disease or malignancy.
There is anaemia and jaundice  splenomegaly.
In addition to the non-specific findings, the direct
antigen test is positive. Blood film shows anisocytosis, reticulocytes and spherocytes. Treatment is with
steroids; splenectomy or immunosuppressants are
considered if steroids do not control the haemolysis.
• Cold agglutinin disease is usually due to IgM
antibodies, occurring following infection with
Mycoplasma pneumoniae or infectious mononucleosis, or in association with haematological malignancy. Complement-mediated haemolysis occurs
in the periphery where the temperature is lower,
causing a variable degree of anaemia and peripheral
discoloration. Treatment is by avoiding cold, transfusion, and treating any underlying condition.
When severe, rituximab and plasma exchange may
be effective.

Mechanical haemolytic anaemia
Mechanical destruction (’shearing’) of red blood cells
can occur in certain diseases or iatrogenically. The most
common iatrogenic cause is poorly functioning heart
valves; high velocity flow and turbulence across a valve
can cause fragmentation of red cells.
Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia occurs when
widespread activation of the coagulation cascade leads
to fibrin strand formation in small vessels, causing

370

shearing of RBCs. This occurs in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), haemolytic uraemic syndrome
(HUS) and HELLP syndrome. These are covered later
in the chapter.

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH)
PNH is an acquired disorder of a haematopoietic precursor cell. An acquired abnormality of a membrane
protein renders a proportion of the patient’s RBCs vulnerable to lysis by complement. Other cell lines are involved, and the classical triad is of pancytopenia,
haemolysis and hypercoagulability.

Sickle cell anaemia
HINTS AND TIPS
Do not deny sickle cell patients adequate analgesia
during a crisis through a misplaced fear of drug
dependency.

Sickle cell anaemia is an inherited (autosomal recessive)
condition that most commonly affects Afro-Caribbeans
but is also found in the Middle East and Mediterranean.
The condition provides advantage in infection with falciparum malaria. It is one cause of sickle cell disease, a
term that also encompasses other inherited causes of
sickling.

Pathology
A single base mutation in the DNA on chromosome 11
causes substitution of glutamic acid for valine at position 6 in the haemoglobin beta chain (HbS). When
HbS becomes deoxygenated it aggregates in an organized fashion, forming polymers within the RBCs that
are less soluble and less deformable. As a result the
erythrocyte shape becomes distorted and changes from
a biconcave disc to a ‘sickle’ shape; the sickle cells cannot readily pass through the microcirculation and become trapped in small vessels (causing infarction)
and in the spleen, where they are destroyed.

Clinical features
In the homozygote, severity is variable and dependent
on factors such as the level of fetal haemoglobin
(HbF) and the co-inheritance of alpha-thalassaemia
trait. It may present from the third month onwards
when levels of HbF start to fall. There is chronic haemolysis, with intermittent crises and complications. There
are four types of sickle cell anaemia crisis:
• Aplastic: usually due to parvovirus B19 infection. Profound anaemia and reticulocytopenia occurs –
usually self-limiting but transfusion may be required.

Anaemia
• Sequestration: sequestration may occur in the spleen
or liver. The haemoglobin drops rapidly, with a compensatory increase in reticulocytes. The involved organs enlarge rapidly. Splenic sequestration is seen
only in children as the spleen is usually infarcted
by the age of 6 years. Exchange transfusion may be
required.
• Painful: due to vascular occlusion. Can be precipitated by dehydration, hypoxia, infections and cold
exposure. Almost any organ can be affected. Small
bones of the hands and feet are most often affected
in childhood (‘hand–foot syndrome’). In older patients, the lungs, hips, shoulders and spine are more
commonly involved. Vascular occlusion is the cause
of serious complications as detailed below.
• Haemolytic: this is rare and may be associated with
coexistent G6PD deficiency. The haemoglobin drops
rapidly, with a compensatory increase in reticulocytes. Increased haemolysis is also seen in association with other crises.

Complications
• Anaemia, usually well tolerated.
• Infection: mainly susceptibility to infection with encapsulated organisms due to hyposplenism (see
Splenectomy section), but also infection of infarcted
bone causing osteomyelitis (Salmonella spp.).
• Vessel occlusion: splenic infarction, TIA and stroke,
renal papillary necrosis, priapism, aseptic necrosis of
the femoral head, placental infarction and spontaneous abortion.
• Gallstones.
• Leg ulceration.
• Acute chest crisis: due to vascular occlusion, infection and bone marrow embolism. New infiltrates
can be seen on X-ray. Mortality is around 3%.

Investigations
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia, with reticulocytosis, raised LDH and low haptoglobin.
• Sickle cells, target cells and nucleated RBCs on blood
film (features of hyposplenism may also be present
following splenic infarction; see Fig. 29.6).
• Haemoglobin electrophoresis or chromatography
demonstrates HbS. HbF levels may be raised.
• Leucocyte and platelet counts may also be raised.
• Prenatal diagnosis can be made using polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) techniques on chorionic villous samples.
The findings are often more severe in episodes of crisis.
Other tests may reveal organ-specific complications.

Treatment
Immunization against encapsulated bacteria and
prompt treatment of infection is extremely important.
During episodes of crisis, supportive care must include

37

effective analgesia as well as optimization of hydration
and oxygenation. Blood transfusion is often necessary.
Other treatments include the following:
• Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea): this cytotoxic
drug is indicated in patients with painful crises, significant anaemia or other complications. It increases
fetal haemoglobin levels and reduces the frequency
of crises. It causes a macrocytosis and myelosuppression in a dose-dependent manner, and there may be
a risk of leukaemia with long-term treatment.
• Long-term folate (increased folate utilization because of haemolysis).
• Prophylactic penicillin in children.
• Exchange transfusions if recurrent crises or significant organ damage.
• Management by a multidisciplinary sickle cell team
reduces admissions and improves patients’ quality
of life.
The only curative treatment is haematopoietic cell transplantation, which is only carried out in patients with severe disease who have an HLA-matched sibling. There is
ongoing research into gene therapy to increase the expression of HbF.

Prognosis
There is 5% mortality in the first 10 years of life. Median
life expectancy is estimated to be in the mid 50s, with
death most commonly due to infection.
Note that in the sickle cell trait (a heterozygous carrier state) the disease is much milder, with little or no
anaemia and a normal blood film. It also provides significant protection against malaria. Crises may be
caused in extreme conditions. The most common complication is renal disease.

Thalassaemia
Thalassaemia is an inherited disease of defective haemoglobin production; normal haemoglobin synthesis is
summarized in Fig. 37.2. The prevalence of thalassaemia is 2.5–15% in affected areas. Alpha-thalassaemia affects those in the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East
and south-east Asia, whereas beta-thalassaemia is found
in China, the Mediterranean, the Middle East and India.
It is an inherited condition. The alpha globin gene is on
chromosome 16 and the beta gene on chromosome 11.

Pathophysiology
• Reduced production of one or more of the haemoglobin chains (most importantly alpha or beta) results in a relative excess and accumulation of the
other chain (‘imbalanced globin chain synthesis’).
There are many known mutations which result in
varying degrees of reduced globin synthesis.
• The unstable haemoglobin precipitates, causing ineffective erythropoiesis and haemolysis.

371

Haematological disorders
Fig. 37.2 Normal haemoglobin synthesis.

Normal haemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide chains (tetramer)
At various stages of development, different polypeptide chains are produced (z, e, a, g, d and b)
In the embryo (first 8 weeks’ gestation), three different haemoglobins are produced by the yolk sac, Hb Gower-1 (z2, e2),
Hb Gower-2 (a2, e2) and Hb Portland (z2, g2)
Fetal haemoglobin (HbF) is composed of two a chains and two g chains (a2, g2) and is the major haemoglobin of
intrauterine life. It declines rapidly around birth and constitutes less than 1% haemoglobin by 6 months of age.
HbF is produced predominantly by the liver until 30 weeks, after which the bone marrow takes over. It has an avid
affinity for oxygen
Production of b chains increases rapidly at 36 weeks’ gestation; 96% adult haemoglobin is HbA (a2, b2), 3.5% is HbA2
(a2, d2) with the remainder being HbF
The genes for the globin chains a and z are found clustered on chromosome 16. The genes for the remaining chains are
located in a cluster on chromosome 11
Each person has four a genes (two on each chromosome 16) and two b genes (one on each chromosome 11)

• There is deficiency of alpha chains in alphathalassaemia and of beta chains in beta-thalassaemia.

Clinical features
• The clinical presentation is dependent on the underlying abnormality, as described in Figs 37.3 and
37.4. Note that carriers with only one defective copy
of the gene (or two in alpha-thalassaemia) are
usually asymptomatic.
• Skeletal change occurs due to expansion of erythropoietic bone marrow.
• Thalassaemia provides an advantage in infection
with falciparum malaria.

• Aplastic crises may occur with parvovirus B19
infection.
Microcytic anaemia is the abnormality on a blood film
in beta-thalassaemia minor. Differentiation from iron
deficiency is possible on the basis of ferritin levels,
red cell distribution width (RDW, a measure of homogeneity of red cell size) and clinical suspicion. MCV is
usually lower in thalassaemia than IDA.

Management
• Transfusion to maintain an adequate haemoglobin
(>10 g/dL) initiated during childhood to ensure
normal growth and development.

• Iron chelation to prevent haemosiderosis using
desferrioxamine.
• Splenectomy can reduce transfusion requirements
but should be avoided where possible because of
the increased susceptibility to infection.
• Long-term folate supplementation in severe disease
(beta-thalassaemia major).
• Vitamin D and calcium for skeletal abnormalities.
• Haematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective
treatment for patients with beta-thalassaemia major,
particularly children. However, HLA-matched cells
are not always available.
• Current research emphasis is on the prospect of
using gene therapy techniques.
• Prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling should
be available.

Pernicious anaemia
This is an autoimmune condition and has an incidence
of roughly 2 per 10 000. However, it is suspected that

pernicious anaemia is underdiagnosed and true rates
may be much higher, especially in the elderly. There
is a strong association with other autoimmune diseases.

Pathology
• Immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies are produced against gastric parietal cells and intrinsic
factor.
• This causes gastric mucosal atrophy with loss of
parietal cells and achlorhydria.
• Production of intrinsic factor, necessary for vitamin
B12 absorption, is reduced.
• Binding of vitamin B12 to intrinsic factor is impaired.

Clinical features
• The onset is usually insidious and is more common
after the age of 50 years.
• Symptoms include those of anaemia and the neurological complications of vitamin B12 deficiency.
• Examination may reveal anaemia, glossitis, mild
jaundice due to haemolysis, low-grade pyrexia, mild
splenomegaly and neurological signs.

373

Haematological disorders
• Complications of anaemia (see Ch. 29).
• Neurological abnormalities from vitamin B12 deficiency (peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined
degeneration of the cord, dementia, optic atrophy).
• Increased risk of gastric carcinoma.

Investigations

Investigations

Management

• Macrocytic anaemia with typical blood film (see
Fig. 29.6).
• White cell and platelet counts: may be low.
• Serum vitamin B12: low, with abnormal Schilling
test (now rarely performed).
• Megaloblastic bone marrow: large erythrocytes, large
hypersegmented neutrophils.
• Bilirubin and LDH increased (due to breakdown of
abnormal RBCs).
• Parietal cell antibody in 90% (seen in up to 50% of
healthy elderly).
• Intrinsic factor antibody in 50%.
• Gastroscopy should be considered to exclude gastric
carcinoma.

Treatment
• Lifelong vitamin B12 replacement.
• Initial response to treatment can be demonstrated by
an increase in reticulocyte count.
Blood transfusion may be required if the patient is haemodynamically compromised or demonstrating ischaemic stress. However, as the patient is often elderly with
comorbidities, and the circulation may be hyperdynamic, the risk of precipitating heart failure must be
considered. Response to vitamin B12 is often rapid
and transfusion can often be avoided.

Aplastic anaemia
This refers to a condition of pancytopenia, i.e. deficiency of all three marrow cell lines, due to a lack of precursor cells in the bone marrow. It may be congenital or
acquired, and is one cause of ’bone marrow failure’. In
Caucasians, incidence is around 3 per million per year.

Aetiology
Most cases of aplastic anaemia are idiopathic, and it
is thought that an autoimmune process is the most
likely reason for precursor cell destruction. In a minority
of cases of acquired aplastic anaemia there may be a
clear link to exposure to viruses, drugs or radiation.
The most common form of congenital aplastic anaemia
is Fanconi anaemia, a polygenic autosomal recessive or
X-linked condition.

Clinical features
• Symptoms of anaemia.
• Excess bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
• Susceptibility to infection due to leucopenia.

374

• Pancytopenia.
• Absence of compensatory reticulocytosis.
• Bone marrow biopsy shows reduced haematopoietic
cells and replacement with fat cells.
• Supportive measures: platelet and blood transfusion, prompt treatment of infection.
• Stem cell transplant in younger patients with severe
aplastic anaemia.
• Immune suppression alone in older patients: antithymocyte globulin and ciclosporin are commonly
used.

Sideroblastic anaemia
Sideroblastic anaemia refers to conditions where anaemia is associated with an excess of abnormal sideroblasts: nucleated erythrocyte precursors containing
iron granules. There is a defect of haem synthesis, leading to disordered erythropoiesis and excess iron in the
marrow.

Aetiology
Sideroblastic anaemia can be congenital or acquired:
• Congenital: X-linked.
• Acquired: in myelodysplastic syndrome (see below)
or secondary to drugs (e.g. isoniazid, pyrazinamide),
alcohol, lead poisoning, myeloproliferative disease,
connective tissue disease.
The patient presents with symptoms of anaemia.

Management
MCV may be low, normal or raised depending on the
underlying cause. Ferritin is raised. Bone marrow examination reveals ring sideroblasts, where haem has accumulated into granules that are situated in a perinuclear
ring. Treatment is supportive, with blood transfusion,
withdrawal of causative agents and iron chelation.

Bone marrow infiltration
Any cause of bone marrow infiltration, if extensive
enough, can cause bone marrow failure and anaemia.
The causes include proliferative syndromes with fibrosis, amyloid, sarcoidosis lymphoma/leukaemia and
metastatic malignancy.

Lead poisoning
This is now rare in developed countries but may occur in
adults due to industrial exposure, and in children from
inhalation or ingestion of lead-containing products.
Presentation may be with gastrointestinal upset, irritability and reduced consciousness, foot drop or wrist
drop, and the Burton line on the gums.

Leukaemia
Complications include peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, anaemia and nephropathy.

Management
• Blood lead levels.
• Full blood count: hypochromic anaemia with
basophilic stippling of RBCs.
• Discuss with poisons information services.
• Treat with disodium calcium edetate (drug of
choice), succimer, dimercaprol or penicillamine.

MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES
These chronic myeloid conditions are classified as neoplastic disorders. They arise from acquired mutations in
a haematopoietic stem cell, which then develops and
proliferates abnormally, resulting in an abnormal population of cells in the bone marrow that interferes with
normal haematopoiesis. There is a risk of transformation into acute leukaemia. They are more common in
men and in the elderly.

Classification
MDS is classified according to how many of the cell lines
are affected, the proportion of blast cells (early precursor cells) in the marrow, and whether specific chromosomal deletions are present. Sideroblastic anaemia is
seen in refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts
(RARS). Risk of leukaemic transformation is highest
in refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB). For
more information, see Further reading.

Clinical features
The symptoms are non-specific and reflect the underlying deficiency. Patients may present with symptoms due
to one or a combination of anaemia, leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia.

37

Management
A prognostic score should be calculated to help guide
treatment. Other factors which are taken into account are the wishes of patients, and their ability to
withstand different treatment regimens. Approaches
are as follows:
• Supportive care, including transfusions or red cells
and platelets, and prompt treatment of infection.
• Low-intensity chemotherapeutic drugs such as azacytadine. These may prolong life but do not offer a
cure.
• High-intensity chemotherapy and stem cell transplant: reserved for younger patients with high-risk
disease.
There are many clinical trials underway investigating
the efficacy of different regimens.

LEUKAEMIA
The leukaemias are a group of conditions characterized
by the malignant proliferation of leucocytes in the bone
marrow. The cells spill out into the bloodstream and
may infiltrate other organs.
In the acute leukaemias, there is a proliferation of
early lymphoid and myeloid precursors (blasts), which
do not mature. The clinical course is very aggressive and
they are rapidly fatal without treatment.
The chronic leukaemias have a more indolent course
and are characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid
and myeloid cells that reach maturity (lymphocytes and
neutrophils, respectively).
All leukaemias are best managed by specialists and
chemotherapy is a rapidly changing field. Most patients
are in clinical trials and only the principles need be
understood by students and junior doctors.
COMMUNICATION
Leukaemia is a frightening diagnosis for most patients.
Make sure they understand the particular form they
have and the outlook with modern therapy.

Investigations
• Full blood count: anaemia with low reticulocytes.
Thrombocytopenia and leucopenia may be present.
• Blood film: poikilocytes (abnormally shaped red
cells) and anisocytosis (unequal size).
• Bone marrow exam: hypercellular with abnormal precursors. Ring sideroblasts in RARS. Increased blast
cells in RAEB.
• Cytogenetics on bone marrow samples may detect
underlying chromosomal abnormalities in the
clone, which have prognostic implications.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
Epidemiology and aetiology
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children under 15 years. Only 15%
of ALL cases occur in adults. Its aetiology is unknown
but is probably multifactorial. A genetic predisposition
is suggested by concordance in twins, and the incidence is increased in Down’s syndrome and ataxia

375

Haematological disorders
telangiectasia. The classification of ALL was previously
according to the FAB system, but the WHO has recommended moving to classification by underlying cell type
(B or T cell) and cytogenetic abnormality.

Treatment

Pathology
• Lymphoblasts proliferate uncontrollably in the bone
marrow and cause bone marrow failure.
• Lymphoblasts circulate in the bloodstream and can
infiltrate the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidneys, testicles and central nervous system (CNS), causing organ failure.
• The pathological cell is a B-cell precursor in 80% of
ALL and a T cell in the remainder.

Clinical features
• Peaks of incidence are at age 5 years and over 65
years.
• The history is usually short, as the disease is so
aggressive (days to a few weeks).
• Rapidly proliferating tumour cells in the bone marrow cause bone pain or symptoms of bone marrow
failure (Fig. 37.5).
• There may be fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly on examination.
• Symptoms or signs due to other organ involvement
may be present: for instance meningism or cranial
neuropathies with CNS involvement.

Investigations
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia with low reticulocyte count.
• High white cell count due to lymphoblasts; neutropenia may be present.
• Thrombocytopenia.
• Bone marrow is hypercellular and dominated by
lymphoblasts (usually >50%).
• Cytogenetic abnormalities may be present (e.g.
hyperdiploidy or the Philadelphia chromosome).
• Urate and LDH high.

All chemotherapy requires careful supportive care with
hydration, prophylactic antibiotics, antiviral and antifungal drugs, septic surveillance, blood products to support pancytopenia, bone marrow colony-stimulating
factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,
monitoring of coagulation, and allopurinol to prevent
tumour lysis syndrome and gout from the increased purine metabolism.
Treatment should be managed in a specialized unit
and include:
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy in three phases: induction
of remission, consolidation and maintenance. The
regimen may be tailored to the cytogenetic profile:
for instance using a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL.
• CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal methotrexate, cranial
irradiation if high risk.
• Monitoring for relapse followed by prompt treatment with salvage chemotherapy.
• Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation often improves outcomes and can be curative. It is usually reserved for patients with high-risk ALL.

Prognosis
Prognosis is poor in infants and adults with a 5-year eventfree survival of 30–40%. In children the 5-year-eventfree survival is 70–80%. However, prognosis is very
variable and depends upon other factors, including
white cell count at presentation, null-cell or T-cell
phenotype, male sex and the type of cytogenetic
abnormalities.

Acute myeloid leukaemia
AML accounts for 20% of all leukaemias and 80% of
adult acute leukaemias. It is much less common in
children.

Aetiology
Most cases arise with no clear cause, though many risks
are recognized:
• Ionizing radiation: survivors of Hiroshima.
• Chemical exposure: leather and rubber workers
(benzene).
• Previous chemotherapy: alkylating agents.
• Predisposing diseases: myeloproliferative diseases,
aplastic anaemia and myelodysplasia, which can
transform to acute leukaemia.

Pathology
• Accumulation of immature haematopoietic blast
cells in the bone marrow, which can cause bone marrow failure.
• Blasts can infiltrate the gums, liver, spleen, skin and,
less commonly, the CNS.
• AML is traditionally classified as shown in Fig. 37.6.
The more recent WHO classification is shown in
Fig. 37.7.

Presentation
• More frequent with increasing age (median age at
presentation is 65 years).
• Symptoms are due to marrow failure (Fig. 37.5) or
organ infiltration by leukaemic cells.
• Eye involvement is relatively common.
• Bone pain, joint pain and malaise may be prominent
symptoms.
• Significant hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may
occur. Lymphadenopathy is rare.

AML, acute myeloid leukaemia; DIC, disseminated intravascular

• Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has a
recognized association with promyelocytic leukaemia, which carries the t(15:17) translocation (previously M3).
• Gingival hypertrophy and skin lesions are features
of monocytic subtypes M4 and M5.
• When the circulating white cell count is very high,
leukostasis may occur, resulting in hyperviscosity
symptoms.

Investigations
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia with low reticulocyte count.
• High white cell count due to circulating blasts;
neutropenia may be present.
• Thrombocytopenia.
• Blasts may contain Auer rods (diagnostic of AML).
• Bone marrow is hypercellular with blasts constituting at least 20%. Flow cytometry on the marrow aspirate will help identify the specific cell type.
• Cytogenetic abnormalities may be present in around
50% of patients. For example, an 8:21 translocation
is associated with a favourable outcome, whereas
monosomy of chromosome 5 is a poor marker.
• Urate and LDH high.
• Calcium and phosphate may also be raised.
• Abnormal renal or liver function may reflect organ
failure due to infiltration.

Treatment
Treatment should be managed in a specialized unit.
Broad principles are as follows:
• Supportive care as for all leukaemias (see ALL).
• Intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy: induction of
remission and post-remission (consolidation)
therapy. The exact regimen is determined by the

377

Haematological disorders

•

•

•

subtype and the risk group, and most patients are in
a clinical trial.
Bone marrow transplantation following remission
may improve outcome in high-risk patients.
Salvage chemotherapy is required when remission is
not achieved or relapse occurs early.
There are many new agents under investigation, including enzyme inhibitors and immunotherapeutics
such as gemtuzumab.
Monitoring of residual disease is performed with
bone marrow inspection, cytogenetics and molecular techniques such as PCR.

Treatment of elderly patients is often difficult due to the
adverse effects of chemotherapy, and lower-intensity
regimens are required.

Prognosis
• In most patients, cure/complete remission should be
the aim; up to 75% of patients enter remission.
Long-term survival is very variable and dependent
on patient-specific factors.
• Poor prognostic factors include increasing age,
very high white cell count, secondary leukaemia
(e.g. previous myelodysplasia), certain cytogenetic
abnormalities and the presence of DIC.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Epidemiology and aetiology
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in the developed world (30% of all leukaemias). The incidence increases with age and it is twice
as common in males. B-cell CLL and small lymphocytic
lymphoma are thought to be part of a spectrum of disease. The aetiology is unknown. Other leukaemias of mature lymphocytes not covered here include hairy cell
leukaemia and pro-lymphocytic leukaemias.

Pathology
• Proliferation of small lymphocytes in bone marrow,
blood and lymphoid tissues.
• These are morphologically mature but functionally
abnormal.
• 95–98% of CLL patients have B-cell phenotype
(remainder are T cells).

Clinical features
• Some patients are asymptomatic; others may describe malaise, weight loss, night sweats, recurrent
infections, bleeding or symptoms of anaemia.
• Lymphadenopathy is usually found (60%).
• Hepatosplenomegaly may also be present.
• Skin involvement is common.

378

Investigations
• Monoclonal lymphocytosis with ‘smear’ or ‘smudge’
cells seen on film.
• Anaemia may be due to marrow infiltration or autoimmune haemolysis (DAT-positive).
• Thrombocytopenia may be due to marrow infiltration or autoimmune destruction.
• Bone marrow shows accumulation of mature lymphocytes constituting over 30% of cells.
• Cytogenetic and immunological analysis will offer
diagnostic and prognostic information.
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia occurs in 50% and
predisposes to infection.

Treatment
CLL usually follows an indolent course. Staging the disease will help guide treatment. The only potential cure is
with stem cell transplant, which carries a high risk of
treatment-related mortality. Initially the disease is often
asymptomatic, and monitoring is sufficient. When disease becomes symptomatic or rapidly progressive, treatment is indicated. There are ongoing clinical trials.
• Chlorambucil (an alkylating agent) is an older,
established treatment.
• Combination therapy involving fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab has shown good results
in clinical trials. Other potential agents are bendamustine and alemtuzumab.
• Autoimmune phenomena are responsive to oral
prednisolone.
• Radiotherapy may be beneficial in symptomatic,
localized disease.
• Splenectomy is sometimes used in refractory hypersplenism.

Prognosis
• Dependent on extent of disease (survival ranges
from 1.5 years to over 12 years).
• In around 10% of CLL, Richter transformation to
high-grade lymphoma occurs as a terminal event.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia
CML accounts for 20% of all leukaemias. It can be considered as a myeloproliferative disease. It occurs mainly
in middle age, most commonly between 40 and 60
years, with a male preponderance.

Pathology
CML is a malignant proliferation of myeloid cells of
unknown aetiology. There is a characteristic chromosome 9:22 reciprocal translocation – the ‘Philadelphia

Multiple myeloma
chromosome’. The resulting fusion gene bcr/abl possesses elevated tyrosine kinase activity and is believed
to be pathogenic in CML.

Clinical features
• Symptoms include lethargy, weight loss, sweats and
left hypochondrial discomfort (enlarging spleen).
• Symptoms of anaemia or thrombocytopenia may be
present.
• On examination there is splenomegaly, which may
be massive.
• Hepatomegaly is present in 50% of cases but lymphadenopathy is uncommon.
• The natural history is characterized by a chronic
phase lasting several years, followed by an acute, aggressive phase similar to acute leukaemia.
• Leukostasis may occur with very high leukocyte counts.

Investigations
• Raised white cell count (often very high) with full
range of immature and mature myeloid cells.
• Anaemia may be due to marrow infiltration or
hypersplenism.
• Thrombocytosis is common.
• Bone marrow demonstrates accumulation of myeloid cells.
• 95% of patients have the Philadelphia chromosome
on light microscopy. The other 5% demonstrate the
fusion protein through molecular studies.
• Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase is low.
• Urate and LDH are high.
• Serum vitamin B12 is high.

Treatment
• Good supportive therapy as needed.
• Imatinib, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
targeting the bcr/abl fusion protein, revolutionized
treatment of CML. It is well tolerated and produces
clinical and cytogenetic response in the vast majority
of cases. Newer TKIs have been developed and clinical trials are ongoing.
• Alpha-interferon and hydroxycarbamide are rarely
used and only if there is intolerance to TKIs.
• Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be curative and should be considered in young patients with
an HLA-matched sibling and those with blast crisis.
• Leucopheresis will reduce the white count quickly in
leukostasis.
• Frequent monitoring of response to treatment is extremely important.

Prognosis
• Chronic phase: median time 2–6 years. With TKIs
93% are progression-free at 6 years.

37

• Acute phase: median survival 3 months without
treatment.
• Transformation is to AML in two-thirds of patients
and to ALL in the remainder.

MULTIPLE MYELOMA
The incidence of multiple myeloma is 5 per 100 000
(1% of all malignancies, 10–15% of all haematological
malignancies), occurring mainly in the elderly. An abnormal proliferation of plasma cells causes features
such as a paraprotein, skeletal lesions, bone marrow
failure, renal impairment and hypercalcaemia.
It is one of a number of diseases associated with abnormal proliferation of a clone of plasma cells (terminally differentiated B cells), also including:
• Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance
(MGUS): presence of a paraprotein but <5% plasma
cells in marrow and no end-organ damage. 1% per
year progress to myeloma.
• Smouldering multiple myeloma: greater than 10%
plasma cells in the bone marrow but no end-organ
damage (anaemia, hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, bone lesions).
• Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia: production of
large amounts of IgM.
• Primary systemic amyloidosis: production of lightchain fibrils which are deposited in organs.

Pathology
• Neoplastic proliferation of a single clone of plasma
cells.
• The malignant cells secrete a monoclonal immunoglobulin or light chain and normal immunoglobulin production is suppressed. The plasma cells can
form tumours called plasmacytomas.
• Osteoclast activity is increased, resulting in bone
reabsorption.
• AL (systemic) amyloidosis affects 10% of cases.

Clinical features
• Symptoms of anaemia may be present.
• Bone pain due to osteolytic lesions and pathological
fractures affect two-thirds of patients.
• Hypercalcaemia is often present, causing typical
symptoms (see Ch. 35).
• Renal impairment: often due to light-chain deposition or hypercalcaemia.
• Recurrent infections result from impaired antibody
response and hypogammaglobulinaemia.
• Examination usually reveals pallor alone.
• Spinal cord compression and radiculopathy can result
from compression by tumour or vertebral collapse.

379

Haematological disorders
• Polymerization of the monoclonal antibody
occasionally results in hyperviscosity syndrome.

Investigations
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia.
• Rouleaux (RBCs sticking together) and background immunoglobulin staining may be seen on
the blood film.
• Plasma viscosity and ESR: usually high.
• Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrates a
monoclonal paraprotein. In 60% it is IgG, 25%
IgA. Free light chains are not usually detected with
this method. Quantification and serial measurement
of the paraprotein enables effective monitoring.
• Free light chains may be detected in the urine (’Bence
Jones protein’) with urine electrophoresis, or in the
serum with a serum free light-chain assay. The majority of paraprotein-negative myeloma secrete free
light chains; a small number are truly non-secretory.
• Skeletal survey with X-rays reveals generalized osteopenia, ‘punched-out’ lytic lesions (‘pepperpot skull’)
and pathological fractures. Bone scans are not
helpful.
• Bone marrow aspirate shows that over 10% of bone
marrow cells are plasma cells. Cytogenetic analysis is
increasingly helpful for prognosis.
• Calcium high; alkaline phosphatase usually normal.
• Renal failure may result from a number of factors
(Fig. 37.8).
• Beta-2-microglobulin level usually high.

HINTS AND TIPS
Psychological care of very sick or terminally ill patients
is an important part of their management, and
referral to a clinical psychologist may help patients
cope with their illness.

Treatment
• Monitoring only in MGUS and smouldering
myeloma.

• Supportive treatment with antibiotics, blood products, analgesics and correction of hypercalcaemia
where necessary.
• Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) improves
event-free survival (though is not curative) and is
performed when the patient is healthy enough to undergo the high-dose chemotherapy required.
• Prior to ASCT, chemotherapy is required to induce remission. There are several potential regimens, such as
CTD (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethasone). Newer agents such as bortezomib are effective.
• In patients not eligible for ASCT, induction chemotherapy regimens may be modified to minimize
toxicity.
• There may be a role for maintenance therapy after
ASCT or induction chemotherapy.
• Following relapse, the treatment depends on the individual case. Further induction chemotherapy may
be used, and there may be a role for a second ASCT.
In those not able to tolerate the above, lenalidomide
offers improved survival.
• Allogeneic transplantation may be curative but has a
high mortality. It is an option for younger patients,
after proper discussion of the risks.
• Radiotherapy may be useful where there is localized
disease causing bony pain.
Please see Further reading for more details.

Prognosis
• The prognosis is very variable. Median survival is
roughly 4 years.
• Poor prognostic factors include certain cytogenetic
profiles, high beta-2-microglobulin levels (most accurate), high paraprotein levels, high urea, low haemoglobin, increasing age and low albumin.

LYMPHOMA
Lymphomas are neoplastic proliferations of lymphocytes that form solid tumours within lymphoid tissue.
They are split into two broad categories on the basis
of histological findings: Hodgkin’s disease (Reed–
Sternberg (RS) cells present) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (all others).

The incidence of Hodgkin’s disease is 5 in 100 000; it

adults and accounts for around 10–15% of all lymphomas. There is a bimodal age distribution with peaks
at 20–30 years and above 50 years with a male

preponderance in childhood Hodgkin’s disease. Its aetiology is unknown but there is a link with Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV) and an increased risk in immunodeficient states
(e.g. HIV, immunosuppressant therapy). It mainly affects Caucasian populations and is more common in
higher socioeconomic groups.

Investigations
• Diagnosis requires lymph node biopsy, and excision
of a whole node is performed if possible to provide
adequate structural information. Needle aspiration
is insufficient.
• Staging of disease is then performed with wholebody CT or PET-CT (Fig. 37.11).
• Bone marrow examination is usually required for
staging, especially if B symptoms are prominent.
Reed–Sternberg cells in the bone marrow indicates
stage IV disease.
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia,
eosinophilia and thrombocytosis.
• Alkaline phosphatase may be raised.

Pathology
• Characteristic RS cells in a background of inflammatory infiltrate.
• RS cells are large bi- or multinuclear cells with
prominent ‘owl-eyed’ nucleoli.
• Hodgkin’s disease is divided, using the Rye classification, into five histological subgroups (Fig. 37.9).
• The pathological cell in nodular lymphocytepredominant Hodgkin’s disease is a variant of the
RS cell, sometimes termed the ’popcorn cell’.

Clinical features

and/or ‘B symptoms’ (Fig. 37.10).
• Lymphadenopathy is supradiaphragmatic in 90%
of patients and mediastinal disease may cause dry
cough and exertional dyspnoea.
• Affected lymph nodes feel rubbery and are nontender.
• Some patients describe pruritus and alcoholinduced lymph node pain.
• Pallor and hepatosplenomegaly may also be found
on examination.

Diagram shows stages I–IV. When you stage a patient you give
a number (I–IV) and a letter (A or B). The letter A denotes
the absence of B symptoms and B denotes the presence of B
symptoms. For example, patients at stage IIA have stage II
lymphoma without B symptoms.

381

Haematological disorders
• LDH raised in bulky disease (prognostic indicator
and marker of disease activity).
• Urate high in bulky disease.
• ESR and CRP often raised.
• Chest X-ray: mediastinal lymphadenopathy
• Staging laparotomy or splenic biopsy is very rarely
performed when the diagnosis is suspected but there
is no other accessible pathological tissue.

Treatment
• Early disease (stages I–II) without adverse prognostic
factors (see below) is treated with up to four cycles of
ABVD (Adriamycin (doxorubicin), bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
• Early disease with adverse prognostic factors is treated
with longer courses of chemotherapy (tailored to
response as measured by PET scan) and radiotherapy.
• Extensive disease (stage III–IV) is treated with chemotherapy alone. ABVD is the accepted standard. Other
regimens are BEACOPP and Stanford V.
• Relapse is treated with alternative chemotherapy
regimen or high-dose chemotherapy followed by
autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Prognosis
The outlook for the predominantly young patients is
good and a positive outcome should be expected.
• Prognosis is greatly affected by histological type and
stage of disease at presentation. With treatment, early
disease without adverse factors has 10-year survival of
up to 97%. Even advanced disease has 5-year survival
rates of over 50%.
• Poor prognostic indicators include B symptoms,
high-stage, lymphocyte-depleted histology, increasing age, bulky mediastinal disease, high ESR and
low albumin.

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
Incidence and aetiology
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) accounts for over
3% of all cancer-related deaths. Incidence increases with
age and the condition is more common in males. The
aetiology is multifactorial, including:
• Genetic predisposition.
• Immunosuppression (particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, also transplant
recipients).
• Viruses (e.g. EBV, particularly Burkitt’s lymphoma).
• A possible link with exposure to ionizing radiation.

Pathology
• Highly heterogeneous group of conditions in terms
of pathological cell type and clinical course.

382

• Neoplastic proliferation of B (usually) or T lymphocytes within the lymphoid system forming solid
tumours which do not have RS cells.
• The most commonly used classification is the WHO
classification, which was updated in 2008, and classifies neoplasms by the cell of origin.
• In practical terms it is often useful to classify lymphomas as indolent/low grade or aggressive/high grade
although disease behaviour varies greatly between individuals, and transformation frequently occurs.

Clinical features
• Indolent lymphoma (such as most follicular lymphomas) usually presents with slowly enlarging lymphadenopathy and less commonly with B symptoms.
• Aggressive lymphoma (such as lymphoblastic, diffuse large B-cell or Burkitt’s lymphoma) may present
with a rapidly growing mass and commonly with B
symptoms.
• A great number of symptoms and signs may be present due to involvement of extranodal sites including skin, lung, bowel, CNS and bone.
• Low-grade NHL progresses slowly but cure is unlikely;
high-grade NHL causes death within months if
untreated, but may be cured in up to 40% of patients.
• Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pallor and
involvement of extranodal sites should be looked for
on examination.

Investigations
• Lymph node biopsy for histology, immunohistochemistry and cytogenetics.
• Staging should then be performed to determine the
extent of disease using the Ann Arbor system
(Fig. 37.11). This usually comprises CT or PET scan
and bone marrow biopsy.
• Circulating lymphoma cells are sometimes seen on
the peripheral film.
• Full blood count may show evidence of bone marrow failure if extensively infiltrated.
• LDH and urate may be high in bulky disease.
• Paraproteinaemia and immune paresis (reduction in
normal immunoglobulins) may be found.
• Lumbar puncture if there is any suspicion of CNS involvement. The CSF should be sent for cytology or
flow cytometry.

Treatment
Indolent NHL
Follicular lymphoma is the most common subtype.
• Stage I or II disease: radiotherapy offers a small
chance of cure. Observation is reasonable if radiotherapy would cause significant morbidity.

Myeloproliferative disease
• Stage III or IV: observation if asymptomatic. In symptomatic disease, rituximab is given with combination
chemotherapy. After successful induction therapy,
rituximab is given as maintenance treatment.
• Combination chemotherapy  rituximab can be
given in refractory disease. There is also a role for
autologous stem cell transplant.

Aggressive NHL
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common
subtype.
• Limited stage I or II disease: radiotherapy, rituximab
(monoclonal anti-CD20) and short-course chemotherapy. CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), Oncovin (vincristine),
prednisolone) is the gold standard.
• In stage III and IV disease, or bulky early-stage disease, treatment is rituximab and longer courses of
chemotherapy(usually 6–8 cycles).
• Relapsed or refractory disease is treated with alternative chemotherapy with the aim of proceeding to
stem cell transplant in eligible patients.
Rituximab is not used in T-cell lymphoma.

Prognosis
• Low-grade NHL: median survival is around 8–10
years.
• High-grade NHL: 40% 5-year disease-free survival.
• Poor prognostic factors include increasing age, high
LDH, extensive disease, T-cell phenotype, certain
extranodal sites, poor performance status and lowgrade NHL that has transformed into high-grade NHL.

37

Clinical features
• Symptoms of raised haematocrit include headache,
weakness, sweating and dizziness.
• Arthralgia and pruritus are commonly experienced.
• Thrombosis may cause visual disturbance.
• The patient looks plethoric (red complexion) and
splenomegaly is present.

Investigations
• Full blood count: raised haematocrit. Thrombocytosis and leucocytosis in 50%.
• Arterial blood gas and erythropoietin level help exclude secondary polycythaemia.
• JAK2 mutation analysis on peripheral blood.
• Bone marrow examination may be required if there
is doubt about the diagnosis or concern about transformation. There is hypercellularity with reduced
iron stores.

Treatment
• In simple erythrocytosis: venesection to lower the
haematocrit.
• If coexistent thrombocytosis or thrombotic events:
hydroxyurea.

Essential thrombocythaemia
In essential thrombocythaemia (ET), the platelet count
is markedly elevated and the platelets are functionally
abnormal. Life expectancy is usually normal with
treatment.

Clinical features

MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASE
These conditions, like myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS), are chronic myeloid neoplasms caused by proliferation of a myeloid precursor cell. The abnormal cells
differentiate into mature cells and, in contrast to MDS, evidence of this is seen in the peripheral blood. There are
four classical syndromes: chronic myeloid leukaemia (associated with the Philadelphia chromosome and covered
above), essential thrombocythaemia (ET), polycythaemia
vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). An acquired
mutation of JAK2 is present in around 95% of patients
with PV and up to 60% of patients with ET or PMF.

Polycythaemia vera
In PV there is an increased number of circulating erythrocytes (raised haematocrit) which cannot be ascribed
to other causes (e.g. chronic hypoxia). There is a risk
of developing myelofibrosis or transformation to acute
leukaemia.

• The majority of patients are asymptomatic at the
time of diagnosis.
• Patients may report headache, lightheadedness or
syncope.
• Episodes of thrombosis and/or bleeding may
occur.
• Transformation to PV, acute leukaemia or myelofibrosis may occur. Most commonly the condition
evolves to myelofibrosis (5–10% at 10 years).

Investigations
• Causes of a reactive thrombocytosis must be excluded.
• Full blood count shows elevated platelets >600 on
two separate occasions.
• Blood film may show bizarre-looking platelets and
platelet aggregates.
• Bone marrow examination: hypercellularity, abundant megakaryocytes without significant fibrosis.
• JAK2 mutation present in around 60%.

383

Haematological disorders

Treatment

Haemophilia A

• Observation alone is sufficient in young patients at
low risk of thrombosis.
• Aspirin is useful for mild symptoms in low-risk
patients.
• Platelet-lowering therapy is required for patients at
high risk of thrombosis; hydroxyurea and anagrelide
are both effective.

Haemophilia A affects 1 in 8000 males. As an X-linked
recessive inherited condition it affects only males, although heterozygous females may experience mild
symptoms.

Primary myelofibrosis

There are many mutations to the factor VIII gene
that may cause haemophilia. The abnormal forms have
reduced factor VIII activity. The condition is classified
as mild, moderate and severe depending on factor
activity relative to normal (i.e. <1%, 1–5% or >5%,
respectively).

In primary myelofibrosis (PMF), there is proliferation of
abnormal cells in all three cell lines, accompanied by release of growth factors which cause bone marrow fibrosis.

Clinical features
• Systemic symptoms: fatigue, weight loss, night sweats.
• Extramedullary haematopoiesis leads to massive
splenomegaly, which may cause discomfort or early
satiety. Hepatomegaly is often present.
• There is an increased risk of thrombotic events.

Investigations
• Full blood count: anaemia. Platelet and white cell
counts are often abnormal but may be elevated or
lowered.
• Blood film shows anisocytosis, teardrop erythrocytes
and immature neutrophils.
• Bone marrow: often very difficult to obtain aspirate
(’dry tap’). Biopsy shows extensive fibrosis.
• Cytogenetics: may help estimate prognosis.

Treatment
• Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only curative
treatment.
• Hydroxyurea is often effective at improving symptoms and reducing splenomegaly. Splenectomy
may be required.
Survival is very variable. In high-risk patients it may be
as little as 1–2 years from diagnosis, but in low-risk patients may be as long as 20 years. The decision of
whether to proceed with stem cell transplant, taking
into account the high mortality associated with the
treatment, is often very difficult.

BLEEDING DISORDERS
An increased tendency to bleeding can result from abnormalities of platelets, the coagulation pathway or
blood vessels. The differential diagnosis, clinical findings and investigation of these disorders are discussed
in detail in Ch. 28. Specific conditions and their management are considered here.

384

Pathology

Presentation
• Severity of bleeding correlates with level of factor
VIII activity (lower levels correspond to more severe
symptoms).
• Bleeding into joints (haemarthrosis) and muscles is
common, and may be spontaneous or secondary to
trauma.
• Recurrent haemarthroses and intramuscular haematomas cause long-term disability due to arthropathy
and contractures.
• Haematuria and intracranial bleeding may occur.
• Bleeding from small cuts is usually minor due to
normal platelet function.
• After trauma, bleeding is out of proportion and often
delayed.

Investigations
• APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time): prolonged; normalizes with addition of 50% normal
plasma.
• PT (prothrombin time): normal.
• Bleeding time: normal.
• Factor VIII assay: low.

Treatment
• Usually managed in specialized haemophilia centres.
• When there is bleeding or the patient requires surgery,
factor VIII levels can be increased in two ways – mild
haemophilia with desmopressin (DDAVP); moderate
or severe haemophilia with recombinant factor VIII
concentrates.
• Other aspects of management include analgesia
(avoiding aspirin), joint replacement, synovectomy
for arthropathy, regular dental care, and psychosocial and genetic support.

37

Bleeding disorders

Prognosis and complications

Investigations

Life expectancy should be normal with current therapies. Previously the complications of receiving factor
VIII concentrates included exposure to HIV, hepatitis
B and C as it was derived from donated blood. This is
much reduced with recombinant factor VIII. The development of inhibitors to infused factor VIII results in a
much worse prognosis.

•
•
•
•

Platelets: normal in number and structure.
APTT: prolonged (may be normal).
PTT: normal.
Prolonged bleeding time and elevated platelet function analyser result.
• vWF assays: low.

Treatment

Haemophilia B (Christmas disease)
Incidence is 1 per 30 000. It is also an X-linked recessive
inherited condition. There is decreased plasma factor
IX activity. The clinical features are identical to haemophilia A.

Investigations
•
•
•
•

APTT: prolonged.
PT: normal.
Bleeding time: normal.
Factor IX assay: low.

Treatment
Treatment is with recombinant factor IX. Desmopressin
has no effect on factor IX levels. Otherwise, treatment is
the same as for haemophilia A. With current therapies
life expectancy should be normal.

Von Willebrand’s disease
Von Willebrand’s disease (vWD) occurs in 1% of the
general population. It is an inherited (autosomal dominant) condition.

Pathology
• Deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF).
• vWF is a plasma protein that mediates platelet adherence to the subendothelium and platelet aggregation. It also binds and stabilizes factor VIII.

Presentation
• Both sexes are equally affected.
• Severity of disease is variable.
• Most patients present with bleeding similar to
platelet disorders: bruising, bleeding into the skin,
mucosal bleeding (epistaxis, bleeding gums, gastrointestinal bleeding).
• Menorrhagia and bleeding following surgery, dental
extractions, trauma and delivery are common.
• In some patients binding to factor VIII is affected,
resulting in low factor VIII levels and a clinical picture similar to haemophilia.

Aspirin should be avoided. Treatment is with desmopressin, tranexamic acid or plasma-derived factor VIII
concentrates (which contain large amounts of vWf) in
haemorrhage or perioperatively. Life expectancy is usually normal.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
In ITP, thrombocytopenia results from antibodymediated destruction of platelets in the spleen and liver.
It affects both adults and children, with an incidence in
adults of around 40 cases per million. The cause is often
unclear, but it may occur following viral illnesses, in the
context of other autoimmune disease (such as SLE) or
lymphoproliferative disease, or following administration of certain drugs. When there is an underlying cause
it is termed ’secondary’ ITP.

Clinical features
• Easy bruising, petechial or purpuric rash.
• Mucosal bleeding and menorrhagia.
• Haematuria and gastrointestinal bleeding is uncommon.
• Splenomegaly is rarely present in isolated ITP and
should prompt consideration of an underlying
diagnosis.

Investigations
• Full blood count: isolated thrombocytopenia, or
anaemia if significant bleeding.
• Blood film: platelet clumps in pseudothrombocytopenia due to EDTA-mediated aggregation. The sample should be repeated in a citrate or heparin tube.
• Bone marrow examination: required in older patients,
when systemic symptoms are present, or if there are
other cytopenias that are not easily explained.

Treatment
It may be difficult to know when to start treatment.
Generally, if patients are symptomatic and platelets
are below 30  109/L, treatment is required. Otherwise,
careful monitoring and advice may be sufficient.
• Transfused platelets are rapidly destroyed and
should only be given in significant acute bleeding.

385

Haematological disorders
• IV immunoglobulin will rapidly (but temporarily)
raise the platelet count.
• High-dose oral prednisolone achieves a response in
up to 75%. Steroids should be withdrawn slowly.
• Splenectomy or other immunosuppressive therapy
may be required if relapse occurs.

DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR
COAGULATION
This is a syndrome characterized by a specific haematological response to a wide range of insults.

Aetiology
DIC may be caused by:
• Malignancy: mucus-secreting adenocarcinomas,
prostate, pancreatic carcinoma, acute promyelocytic
leukaemia (AML–M3).
• Infection: Gram-negative (most commonly) or Grampositive sepsis.
• Obstetric: amniotic fluid embolism, placental abruption, pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, septic
abortion.
• Tissue damage: rhabdomyolysis, fat embolism, severe trauma, burns.
• Immunological: incompatible blood transfusion,
drug reaction, anaphylaxis.
• Liver disease: acute fatty liver of pregnancy, fulminant liver failure.
• Others: snake bites, acute pancreatitis.

• Gastrointestinal and pulmonary haemorrhage may
also occur.

Investigations
• Platelet count: low.
• PT and APTT: prolonged.
• Fibrinogen: usually low (may be normal as acute
phase reactant).
• D-dimers/fibrin degradation products: high.
• Blood film: fragmented RBCs due to microangiopathic haemolysis.

Treatment
• Treatment of the underlying disease is the first priority and may resolve the DIC.
• Meticulous supportive care (e.g. fluids, antibiotics,
debridement of gangrene).
• Replacement of platelets and clotting factors (using
fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) may be used
if there is haemorrhage or risk of haemorrhage (e.g.
in surgery).
• Pharmacological inhibitors of coagulation or fibrinolysis (e.g. heparin or tranexamic acid) may be
beneficial in certain circumstances but their use is
controversial.

Prognosis
Mortality is up to 80% in severe DIC and is usually due
to the underlying disease.
COMMUNICATION

Pathology
• Initially, intravascular coagulation is precipitated by
release of tissue factor or procoagulant substances
into the circulation from injured cells, malignant
cells, or damaged endothelium.
• Microthrombi form throughout the microcirculation causing ischaemia and infarction.
• Platelets, fibrin and clotting factors are consumed by
the thrombotic process and the fibrinolytic system
becomes activated; these two processes result in a
tendency to bleed, and haemorrhage may be
significant.

Presentation
• DIC is often severe and life-threatening, but may be
chronic and compensated when due to malignancy.
• Thrombosis can cause widespread ischaemia or infarction leading to renal failure, liver failure and
CNS involvement.
• Bleeding is often into the skin or from recent venepuncture sites.

386

Raised total protein with a normal albumin level should
raise suspicion of the presence of a paraprotein.

THROMBOTIC DISORDERS AND
THROMBOEMBOLISM
HINTS AND TIPS
The causes of thromboembolism can be broken down
by Virchow’s triad:
• Changes in the vessel wall.
• Changes in the blood flow.
• Changes in the composition of the blood.

Thromboembolism is common, and the increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis following long journeys
(so-called ’economy class syndrome’) has made it a
well-known area among the public.

Aetiology
Risk factors for venous thromboembolism are outlined
in Fig. 37.12.

Pathology
• Venous thrombosis can be caused by abnormal vessel walls, venous stasis or hypercoagulable blood.
• Thrombosis may be precipitated by a specific provoking event such as surgery or a physiological state
such as pregnancy.
• The lower limbs are the most common site of
thrombosis.
• Small clots may break off and cause pulmonary embolus or, very rarely, cerebral infarction by paradoxical embolus in patients with a patent foramen
ovale.

Presentation
• Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) causes local pain,
swelling, redness and oedema.
• The diagnosis can be difficult to make on clinical
grounds.
• Pulmonary embolus (PE) causes sudden onset of
pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis.
• Patients with inherited hypercoagulable states may
present with venous thromboses without obvious

precipitants, in unusual places (e.g. Budd–Chiari
syndrome), at an early age or with spontaneous
abortions.
• Antiphospholipid syndrome and hyperhomocysteinaemia increase the risk of arterial as well as venous
thromboses.

Investigations
• Careful clinical examination should be performed to
look for an underlying cause such as malignancy,
and investigations requested appropriately.
• The pre-test probability of VTE should be evaluated
with an accepted scoring system.
• In cases where the risk score is low or equivocal,
D-dimer measurement may be helpful. It is a sensitive but non-specific test, and helps to exclude DVT.
• The final step is to perform the appropriate imaging
test on the at-risk patients. This may be ultrasound,
ventilation–perfusion scanning or CT pulmonary
angiography (CTPA).
• A baseline platelet count and clotting screen should
always be performed.
• If the patient is young, ask if there have been recurrent episodes, recurrent spontaneous abortions or a
family history of thromboembolism, and consider
hereditary thrombophilia. Assays are available to detect these abnormalities.

387

Haematological disorders

Treatment if thrombosis is proven
• Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin
should be started. It is licensed for both DVT and PE.
The lack of need for monitoring has allowed the
treatment of DVT as an outpatient. The indications
for unfractionated heparin are decreasing; among
them are renal failure or mechanical heart valves.
• Oral warfarin should be given simultaneously and
monitored using the international normalized ratio
(INR), which should be maintained between 2 and 3.
• Heparin should be continued until the INR is
therapeutic.
• If heparin is contraindicated, agents such as the hirudins or fondaparinux can be used.
• Newer oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran and
rivaroxaban, are being introduced in certain contexts
and may eventually replace warfarin completely.
HINTS AND TIPS
Warfarin alone is initially PROcoagulant due to its more
rapid inhibition of PROtein C and S.

Treatment period
The length of time a patient should be anticoagulated is
controversial and always under review, but as a general
rule is 3–6 months depending on the extent and the existence of a precipitating factor such as a period of
immobilization.
Above-knee DVTs are at increased risk of propagating
along the venous system and embolizing to the lungs.
Two or more thromboses, whether provoked or unprovoked, indicate that lifelong anticoagulation is required.

THROMBOTIC
THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA
AND HAEMOLYTIC URAEMIC
SYNDROME
These two conditions are characterized by thrombosis
and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. They share
several features and are often considered together. Mortality is up to 80% without treatment.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
(HUS)
HUS is most common in children, and 90% of cases occur following a diarrhoeal illness, particularly with
pathogenic Escherichia coli. The remaining 10% can be
due to a variety of causes including viruses, drugs and

388

cancer. Complement abnormalities may underpin the
pathogenesis.

Clinical features
The cardinal features of HUS are acute kidney injury,
thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia. Involvement of other organs, particularly the liver and CNS, occurs in up to 20%.

Investigations
• Haematology: anaemia, thrombocytopenia DAT
negative.
• Biochemistry: renal impairment, raised LDH, raised
bilirubin.
• Blood film: red cell fragments, reticulocytes.
• Coagulation studies: normal (as opposed to DIC).

Treatment
• Typical HUS (following diarrhoea) is usually selfresolving with supportive care. Dialysis is sometimes
required.
• Plasma exchange or immunosuppression may be
required.
• Eculizumab (anti-complement) may be effective.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare
disease, most common in young adults. It is a combination of signs, symptoms and characteristic blood
film appearance. Reduced ADAMTS-13 (a metalloproteinase) activity allows large von Willebrand factor
multimers to enter the circulation, causing platelet aggregation and microthrombi.

Clinical features
The classical ’pentad’ consists of:
•
•
•
•

Haemolytic anaemia: typical symptoms.
Thrombocytopenia: bleeding.
Acute kidney injury.
Prominent neurological features such as lethargy,
headache, confusion and seizures.
• Pyrexia that is not caused by infection.
These features may not all be present and clinical suspicion is necessary.

Investigations
• Blood film: anaemia, reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and fragmented red cells (schistocytes).
• Bilirubin and LDH: increased due to haemolysis.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uraemic syndrome
• Coagulation: usually normal.
• ADAMTS-13 assays are available but take too long to
help with diagnosis.

Treatment
Plasma exchange has vastly improved the prognosis and
most people achieve a lasting response. Immunosuppression is also used.

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• How the human immunodeficiency virus causes disease in humans.
• The definition and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy.
• The findings in the full blood count and blood film in malaria.
• The methods of prevention you should advise in a malarial area.
• The problems posed by resistant bacteria and strategies to combat them.

INTRODUCTION
Infections affecting specific systems have been discussed
in the appropriate chapters. This chapter considers three
important and very different infections – human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and drug-resistant
bacteria, in particular methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA).

HIV AND AIDS

Epidemiology
The Department of Health estimates that around 90 000
adults in the UK are living with HIV, of whom a quarter
are unaware of the diagnosis. The World Health Organization estimates that around 35 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, more than three-quarters
of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. In some countries,
such as Botswana, the adult prevalence of HIV is up to
25%, and it is threatening the stability of society. There
has been a huge drive to increase the provision of antiretroviral therapies to these countries, but the development
of effective strategies remains difficult.

Aetiology
HIV-1 was first identified in 1983; it is found throughout the world and is the main cause of disease in
humans.
HIV-2 is endemic in west Africa and less common
outside this region. It accounts for around 5% of worldwide HIV cases. Its similarity to the simian immunodeficiency virus led to the theory of cross-species transfer
gaining widespread acceptance as its origin in humans.

HIV can be transmitted by sexual, parenteral and vertical routes (Fig. 38.1).

Pathology
HIV is a lentivirus, which is a subgroup of the human
retroviruses. Its genetic information is stored in a single
strand of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Three specific genes
produce proteins essential for HIV survival (Fig. 38.2).
The virus can infect any cells expressing CD4 (notably
T-helper cells which are central to the immune response) as well as macrophages, monocytes and microglia. CD4 acts as a receptor for glycoprotein (gp120) on
the virus envelope, allowing the virus to enter the cell.
Co-receptors such as CXCR4 and CCR5 are recognized
as important and potential therapeutic targets.
The enzyme reverse transcriptase makes DNA copies
of the virus RNA, which become integrated into the host
cell’s genome, resulting in production of more virus
particles. The normal function of the infected cells is
disrupted and the host cells are eventually destroyed.
Because the principal cells affected are those of the
immune system, HIV infection is characterized by diseases resulting from immunodeficiency (e.g. infections
and malignancies).

Presentation
Staging of HIV/AIDS was initially developed in 1985,
and there are currently two main systems in use. The
American CDC staging system uses the CD4 count
and the presence of certain HIV-related illness to classify
the clinical stage as A, B or C (see Fig. 38.3). The WHO
system is designed for use when access to a CD4 count is
not always available and describes four stages outlined
below. Fifty per cent of untreated patients will develop
the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) after
10 years. A minority remain asymptomatic for many

histiocytosis.

During this stage (which broadly corresponds to CDC
stage B) the illness is symptomatic, and conditions occur that are due to immune deficiency or HIV infection
itself. Although many of these may occur in other clinical situations, they are more severe in the context of
HIV. However, these are not ’AIDS-indicator’ illnesses.
Constitutional symptoms are common. See Fig. 38.4.

years without treatment. Depending on the level of persistent viraemia, they are classified as ’long-term nonprogressors’ or ’elite controllers’.

Primary HIV infection
In the majority of patients this results in a ’seroconversion illness’ occurring around 4 weeks after infection.
Symptoms are similar to those seen with other viral infections, including fever, arthralgia, headaches, rash,
generalized lymphadenopathy and occasional neurological abnormalities. The illness is self-limiting and
usually resolves within 8 weeks.

Clinical stage 1
During this early stage of HIV infection the patient is either asymptomatic or has persistent generalized lymphadenopathy: rubbery, mobile, enlarged lymph nodes

392

Clinical stages 3 and 4
In stages 3 and 4 constitutional symptoms may be more
severe, and the conditions that occur indicate that the
immunosuppression is more profound. The appearance
of these conditions, detailed in Fig. 38.4, are a guide
to initiating or changing treatment. Any system can be
affected. Malignancies are seen with increased frequency
and may be associated with specific viral infections (see
Fig. 38.5). These stages broadly correspond to CDC
stage C, although there are some minor discrepancies.

Investigations
All investigations for HIV infection should be performed under the strictest confidentiality. The condition is far more treatable than in the past, but the
diagnosis still has social, financial, health and psychological implications. Education and counselling are important. In the USA, the CDC advocates HIV screening
for adults as part of routine medical care. This practice
has not yet become widespread in the UK.
The presence of HIV infection can be assessed by the
measurement of viral antigens, HIV RNA detection, the
immune response to the infection (anti-HIV antibodies) or the effects of the infection (CD4þ count).
Fig. 38.6 summarizes the findings at the different stages.
In practice, the diagnosis is usually made using HIV
antibody tests. The screening test is repeated if positive
or borderline. If repeatedly positive, another assay such
as Western blotting is used to confirm the diagnosis.
This combination of tests gives high sensitivity and
specificity.
HIV antibodies may be undetectable for up to 3
months after infection and this is a window for falsenegative results; if clinical suspicion is high, testing
needs to be repeated or a different method used.
Once the diagnosis is reached the disease activity
should be assessed. This is done by quantifying both
HIV RNA viral load and CD4þ cell count. The prognosis
is worse with a higher viral load and lower CD4 count,
as these indicate a more rapid progression from early to

late stages of infection. Viral load and CD4 count are
also used to follow the response to drug therapy.
Drug resistance is problematic in a small proportion
of patients, and testing for resistant strains at diagnosis
is recommended.
COMMUNICATION
Do not be afraid to perform an HIV test. It is important
to discuss your intention with the patient, but
counselling is no longer considered essential.

Treatment
The treatment of HIV has changed hugely in the last 10
years. HIV is not curable, but the advent of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved
disease control and life expectancy. The aim is to reduce
viral load to as low as possible and raise CD4þcounts.
HAART involves the use of several drugs from different
classes in order to reduce the development of resistant
viral strains and to maximize the treatment response.
In contrast to the pre-HAART era, drug therapy is begun
early in the disease process, and is advised for patients
with a CD4 count below 350 cells/mL or those with

AIDS-indicator illnesses. The role of HAART in primary
infection is not yet established. The three common classes are:
• Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(e.g. zidovudine, lamivudine and didanosine).
• Non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. efavirenz and nevirapine).
• Protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir and
saquinavir).
Newer drugs include integrase inhibitors (e.g.raltegravir), fusion inhibitors and CCR5 receptor antagonists
(e.g. maraviroc). Fig. 38.7 shows the sites of action.
Treatment should be under HIV specialists and the exact
regimen varies from person to person. The legion of potential side effects and interactions from these drugs
provides another reason for specialist care.
As HIV treatment has improved, the incidence of
HIV-associated infection and malignancy has changed
and in many cases diminished. Opportunistic infections
commonly seen in HIV are shown in Fig. 38.8. Tuberculosis, particularly following the emergence of drugresistant strains, is problematic in parts of the world
where HIV incidence is high. Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are frequently seen in
HIV infection. Treatment of KS includes HAART, local
treatments (radiotherapy or intralesional chemotherapy)
or systemic chemotherapy.

Prevention
Despite HAART, there is no ‘cure’ for HIV infection; preventative measures must remain the highest priority.
Such measures include education, the provision of clean
needles for IV drug abusers, the use of condoms, the
screening of blood products and organs donated for
transplantation, and avoidance of breastfeeding in
HIV-positive mothers. Research continues into new
treatments and the possibility of a vaccine. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) reduces transmission rates
in healthcare workers following needlestick injury.

Prognosis
This is strongly related to viral load and CD4þ count.
Untreated patients with a CD4þ count <50 cells/mL
have a 90% 3-year mortality rate while it is only 25%
if the count is >250 cells/mL. The long-term prognosis
in people who respond well to HAART with high
CD4þ counts and unrecordable viral load is not known,
but many are asymptomatic and living normal lives
more than 10–15 years post diagnosis.

MALARIA

Epidemiology
Worldwide, malaria affects over 200 million people and
causes around 1 million deaths each year. It is endemic
in the tropics and subtropics. It is seen in temperate
zones when imported by people who have visited or
come from endemic areas. In the UK, approximately
2000 cases are notified each year.

Aetiology
The disease is caused by protozoal infection with one of
the species of the genus Plasmodium (P. vivax, P. ovale,
P. malariae or P. falciparum).

Pathology
Malaria is spread from an infected person to a noninfected person by sporozoites from the bite of a female
Anopheles mosquito. The sporozoites multiply in hepatocytes, leading to thousands of merozoites, which then
invade red blood cells. In addition, P. vivax and P. ovale
organisms persist in the liver as hypnozoites which may
lie dormant for months or years. Schizogony (asexual
reproduction) then occurs in red blood cells; eventually
cells rupture, releasing malaria parasites, malaria antigen, haemoglobin, cytokines (especially tumour necrosis factor) and other constituents of the red blood cells
into the bloodstream, causing the typical clinical
picture.
This occurs every 72 h in P. malariae (quartan malaria),
every 48–72 h in P. vivax and P. ovale (tertian malaria) and
every 48 h in P. falciparum (subtertian malaria). P. vivax,
P. ovale, and P. malariae invade up to 2% of the circulating
red blood cells. P. falciparum may affect over 10% of cells,
producing a potentially life-threatening illness.
Fig. 38.9 demonstrates the life cycle of malaria.

Presentation
Malaria is characterized by periodic high fever, sweating
and rigors, which coincide with release of merozoites
from erythrocytes. Nausea and vomiting, abdominal

396

pain, diarrhoea, headache, cough and arthralgia/myalgia may also be present. Splenomegaly is commonly
found but mild icterus and massive hepatomegaly
may also be present. Fig. 38.10 summarizes the complications of P. falciparum malaria.

Investigations
• Thin and thick blood films: thick films allow parasites to be identified; thin films are useful in species
identification. The degree of parasitaemia is important. Repeat films may be needed.
• Antigen detection kits are useful for rapid diagnosis.
PCR may be more sensitive than microscopy, but
takes much longer. It is useful for species or strain
identification.
• Anaemia and leucocytosis may occur. Thrombocytopenia is common.
• Urea and electrolytes: renal failure.
• C-reactive protein: normally raised.
• Coagulopathy: may be a feature of P. falciparum
infection.
• Liver function tests: often become abnormal. Raised
bilirubin due to haemolysis.
• Hyponatraemia: P. falciparum.
• Hypoglycaemia may be seen.

Treatment
The treatment of malaria is under constant review as resistant strains develop. Up-to-date information regarding prophylaxis and treatment of malaria should be
obtained from local infectious disease centres.
COMMUNICATION
Travellers, including those returning to visit their home
countries, need careful instruction about the need
for malaria prophylaxis, both medication and
precautions against mosquito bites.

The acute episode
Management of the acute episode includes:
• Supportive care as appropriate; severe cases should
be managed in a critical care setting.
• Oral chloroquine for P. vivax, P. ovale and
P. malariae.
• P. falciparum is commonly resistant to chloroquine.
There are three common regimens used: quinine
(IV if severe) with doxycycline or clindamycin; Coartem (artemether–lumefantrine); and atovaquone–
proguanil.

Eradication therapy
The eradication of liver parasites to prevent future relapse:

Cerebral malaria (hyperpyrexia, coma, death)
Hypoglycaemia
Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Seizures
Severe intravascular haemolysis with
haemoglobinuria (‘blackwater fever’)
Acute renal failure
Hepatic necrosis
Jaundice
Haemolytic anaemia
Lactic acidosis
Coagulopathy (including DIC)

• Necessary in P. ovale and P. vivax.
• Primaquine is used. Consider testing for glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency prior to commencing treatment as severe haemolysis may occur
in these patients.

DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Chemoprophylaxis

• IV artesunate may offer a survival advantage over IV
quinine in severe complicated malaria.
• Exchange transfusion may be useful when there is a
high level of parasitaemia.

Prevention
With the emergence of resistant organisms, the avoidance of mosquito bites and mosquito control take on
greater importance.

For chemoprophylaxis, refer to up-to-date information
(e.g. the British National Formulary or the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). It should be started
1 week prior to travel and continued for at least 4 weeks
after return.
Medications used include chloroquine, proguanil–
atovaquone, mefloquine and doxycycline. All have side

397

effects and the risks and benefits should be made available to patients.

Avoidance of mosquito bites
Mosquito nets and repellents are vital. Appropriate clothing should be worn: i.e. long sleeves and trousers around
dawn and dusk, which is when the female Anopheles
mosquito is most active.
Spray bedroom with insecticide last thing in the
evening.

Prognosis
Prognosis is excellent with P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae infection. P. falciparum is still a life-threatening condition, and cerebral malaria is of particular concern,
with mortality of up to 20%.

DRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIA
The last decade has seen an increase in the emergence of
drug-resistant strains of bacteria, commonly ascribed to
the overuse of low-dose antibiotics which exert an environmental pressure on the pathogens. Drug resistance
may be acquired via mutation or bacterial plasmid
transfer.
Drug-resistant bacteria are important in terms of
mortality, morbidity and increased cost. The subject is
frequently politicized, often driven by sensationalist
reporting of the latest ’superbug’ or ’killer bacteria’. Patients may be worried about these infections when they
come to hospital.
As a medical student and doctor, the single biggest
contribution to be made to limiting spread is effective
hand hygiene with hand washing or alcohol gel. Most
hospitals have a ’bare below the elbow’ policy: shirts
should be short-sleeved or have the sleeves rolled up.
Ties are less commonly worn, and should be tucked
in or clipped to shirts. Remember to clean your stethoscope regularly as well!

398

Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus
MRSA results in the same range of presentations as other
S. aureus infections but is highly resistant to antibiotic
therapy. It is not untreatable. MRSA is resistant to most
beta-lactam antibiotics, but often sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid, as well as other antibiotics in individual cases.
In hospital, patients are routinely screened (nose/
axilla/groin) for MRSA. Patients are often admitted with
MRSA colonization, especially those from long-term
care facilities. Those positive have eradication therapy,
barrier nursing if needed and special precautions are
taken in certain situations (e.g. they may be last on a
theatre list, so it can be cleaned post operation to prevent contamination of other patients).

Other resistant bacteria
• Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) may have
emerged due to the increased use of vancomycin
treatment for MRSA and C. difficile. Enterococci are
common gut flora but in at-risk patients may cause
UTI, wound infections and bacteraemia.
• Resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas are a common problem in chronic suppurative
respiratory conditions, such as bronchiectasis and
cystic fibrosis, as well as intensive care units where
they may cause ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Drug overdose and abuse

39

Objectives
The key learning points for this chapter:
• How to assess a patient with suspected drug overdose.
• The general approach to management of patients with possible drug overdose.
• The management of specific common drug overdoses.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Drug overdose results in a significant proportion of all
acute hospital admissions and has an overall incidence
of around 2 per 1000 population. Around 25% of
suicides are due to deliberate drug overdose. Admission
following the use of illegal drugs is also frequently seen –
common substances are covered in Figs 39.1 and 39.2.

AETIOLOGY
Overdose may be due to the following:
• Accidental: particularly in children.
• Deliberate: in suicide, attempted suicide or deliberate self-harm, homicide or child abuse (e.g. Münchhausen’s syndrome by proxy).
• Iatrogenic: e.g. drug interactions, reduced metabolism/excretion (renal failure, liver failure).

establish the likely ongoing risk and to help plan investigation and treatment. However, it is good policy to
treat the patient and not the history, as this may be
unreliable.

Try to assess the suicide risk
Features conferring higher suicide risk are detailed in
Fig. 39.3. It is important to cover the events leading to
the overdose – did the patient intend suicide at the time
or was it an impulsive reaction to an acute stressor such
as an argument? Evidence that the act was premeditated
should be sought (e.g. collecting tablets over a period of
time, a suicide note, taking tablets when the patient
expected to be alone). The actions after taking the overdose, and the course of events leading to hospital admission are also important – did the patient themselves
ring for help? Ask about ongoing suicidal ideation and
low mood.
COMMUNICATION

PRESENTATION

History
Drug overdose in many patients results in a mild illness
requiring little intervention. However, some patients take
many tablets or cocktails of drugs, causing a lifethreatening state requiring intensive care. Around 80%
of patients are conscious and able to provide a history.
In all patients, particularly the unconscious, further history from family, friends and the ambulance staff is likely
to be very helpful and should be actively sought. Always
consider overdose in any unconscious patient. Where
possible, try to establish the following facts.

What drugs were taken and when?
It is very common for more than one drug to be taken,
and alcohol is often also used. Try to establish which
tablets were taken, how many and how long ago to

Patients presenting with deliberate self-harm or
attempted suicide are often challenging and difficult
to engage. If the patient is happy for friends or family to
be present, ensure they are involved. Input from
psychiatry is also very important.

Examination
The examination should be in three stages: assess how ill
the patient is; look for evidence to suggest the likely
drug(s) involved; and look for complications of overdose.

How ill is the patient?
The first priority is ABC – check the Airway, Breathing
and Circulation. Assessment of conscious level, pulse,
blood pressure, temperature and blood glucose should
then be made.

Drug overdose and abuse
Fig. 39.1 Specific measures in the management of drug overdose with certain of the more common drugs.

Drug

Toxic side effects

Specific management

Opiates

Respiratory depression, drowsiness or
coma, pinpoint pupils, hypotension,
bradycardia, hypothermia, pulmonary
oedema

Naloxone 0.8–2 mg IV (may need to be repeated
every 2–3 min to a maximum of 10 mg because of
its short half-life); can be administered by
continuous IV infusion

Benzodiazepines

Drowsiness, dysarthria, nystagmus, ataxia,
coma, respiratory depression; fairly safe if
taken alone but potentiate the effects of
other sedative drugs, which are often taken
at the same time

Flumazenil 200 mg over 15 s, then 100 mg every 60 s
until response (maximum dose 1 mg); should be
used cautiously

Paracetamol

Nausea and vomiting in the first 24 h; acute
hepatocellular necrosis may develop after
3 days with as few as 20 tablets causing
jaundice, encephalopathy, hypoglycaemia
and abdominal pain; renal tubular necrosis
may also occur

Monitor blood pressure, prothrombin time, glucose,
creatinine, pH, and for signs of encephalopathy:
these parameters determine the need for specialist
referral; check paracetamol levels from 4 h onwards
(treatment may begin before result is available if
significant overdose suspected); use nomogram to
determine whether antidote should be given if less
than 24 h since tablets were taken
Give acetylcysteine (Parvolex) by IV infusion
Oral methionine may be given instead if overdose
less than 12 h before

Aspirin

Nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, deafness,
sweating, hyperventilation, tachycardia,
delirium, seizures, coma, impaired clotting,
hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia, metabolic
acidosis (respiratory alkalosis initially)

Correct dehydration, hypokalaemia and
hypoglycaemia
If plasma salicylate levels >500 mg/L (3.6 mmol/L),
urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate
under close supervision
In severe poisoning (>700 mg/L or 5.1 mmol/L),
haemodialysis may be life-saving

Iron

Usually accidental affecting children
Causes haemorrhagic enteritis (corrosion)
with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
haematemesis, bloody diarrhoea, acute
hepatocellular necrosis, metabolic acidosis,
peritonitis, hypotension, coma

Desferrioxamine by IV or IM injection

Digoxin

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
hyperkalaemia, bradyarrhythmias,
tachyarrhythmias, altered colour vision,
delirium

Correct electrolyte disturbance
Temporary ventricular pacing in atrioventricular block
Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Digibind) in
severe overdose

Beta-blockers

Bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac failure,
convulsions, coma, asystole

Atropine IV for bradycardia
Glucagon IV in severe overdose

Heparin

Haemorrhage

IV protamine sulphate

Warfarin

Haemorrhage

IV vitamin K, IV infusion of concentrates of factors II,
VII, IX and X, or fresh frozen plasma

Tricyclic
antidepressants

Tachycardia, dry mouth, drowsiness,
mydriasis, increased reflexes, seizures, coma
Prolonged QT interval may cause VT/SVT

Supportive measures; special attention to acidosis
Sodium bicarbonate if significant overdose
Lidocaine for arrhythmia

Is there any evidence to suggest an
underlying cause?

alert you to their last prescription and if they have taken
overdoses previously. Also look for:

Relatives or ambulance staff may have brought bottles
from the scene. Look for evidence on the patient such
as diabetic cards or hospital appointment cards (e.g.
insulin overdose). The hospital’s electronic system may

• Pinpoint pupils: opiates, organophosphates.
• Dilated pupils: tricyclic antidepressants, amphetamines, cocaine.
• Nystagmus: phenytoin, alcohol.

Note that a low-reading thermometer can be used to detect hypothermia.

INVESTIGATIONS
• Paracetamol and salicylate levels should be measured in all patients.
• Urea and electrolytes (including magnesium), blood
glucose, serum osmolarity, creatine kinase.
• Baseline clotting and liver function tests in paracetamol overdose.
• Drug levels can be measured in the blood, gastric
contents and urine. The timing may be important
(e.g. paracetamol overdose).
• Arterial blood gas to assess respiratory depression or
stimulation (opiates, salicylate) and acid-base status.
• ECG is advisable in all patients, as many drugs can
cause arrhythmia in overdose.

• Chest X-ray: if evidence of aspiration.
• If unconscious, consider further imaging to rule out
an intracranial event.

MANAGEMENT
The management of drug overdose can be divided into
three parts: general measures for all patients; specific
measures according to the drug taken; and psychiatric
assessment and social input when the patient recovers
physically.

General approach
Supportive care
• If unconscious, assess airway and give oxygen via a
face-mask.
• If not maintaining airway, call anaesthetist as the patient may need intubation.

401

Drug overdose and abuse
• Some patients may require assisted ventilation.
• Maintain blood pressure with IV fluid as required.
• Measure observations regularly – patients who seem
well may deteriorate rapidly.
• Attach cardiac monitor if arrhythmia is suspected or
the patient is known to have taken tricyclic antidepressants or cardiac medications, e.g. beta-blockers,
digoxin.
• In arrhythmia, correct hypoxia, acidosis or electrolyte
imbalance; antiarrhythmic agents should be used
with caution as they can exacerbate the arrhythmia.
• Convulsions should be treated with IV benzodiazepines.

Preventing absorption in the bowel
Gastrointestinal absorption may be decreased with activated charcoal. Induced emesis is not recommended.
Gastric lavage is very infrequently used, and only if
the patient presents very shortly after ingestion and if
recommended by the National Poisons Information
Service (NPIS).
• Activated charcoal binds poisons in the stomach preventing absorption.
• It is more effective the sooner it is given, and is usually used within 1 h of ingestion.
• Repeated doses are very infrequently used.
• It is contraindicated in drowsy patients (risk of
aspiration).
• It is ineffective for iron, lithium, potassium, alcohol
and cyanide.
• Whole bowel irrigation is not routinely recommended but can be considered in iron overdose or
in enteric-coated drugs.

Increase elimination of drug
Elimination of drugs can be increased using urinary alkalinization or dialysis.

Urinary alkalinization
• Increases renal excretion of mildly acidic drugs.
• Used in severe salicylate, phenobarbital and amphetamine overdose.
• A good urinary output is required. Fluid balance,
electrolytes and acid–base status should be monitored very carefully.

Dialysis
Dialysis is used in severe overdose when other methods
are contraindicated, unsuccessful or likely to be unsuccessful. Haemodialysis is especially useful for overdose
of salicylate, lithium, alcohols and polyethylene glycol.
Haemoperfusion is useful for protein-bound drugs but
is very rarely performed.

402

Specific antidotes
Advice for overdose of any drug or ingestion of any poisons can be obtained 24 h a day from a number of poisons information centres run by the NPIS. Each A&E
department and hospital switchboard will have a list
of national numbers, as well as access to the NPIS online
database, Toxbase, which provides a vast amount of
detailed information.
Fig. 39.1 summarizes the features and management
of overdose of some of the more common drugs.
HINTS AND TIPS
Some people are at higher risk of serious harm from
paracetamol overdose and require treatment at
lower serum levels. Risk factors include
malnourishment, liver disease, long-term alcohol
excess and taking liver enzyme inducing drugs
(e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine).

Psychiatric and social assessment
Once the acute event and medical management is completed, an assessment of the patient’s psychiatric state
(ongoing suicidal risk) and social circumstances should
be made, however trivial the overdose may have
appeared. Where appropriate, psychiatrists and social
care workers should be involved.

ILLEGAL DRUGS
Due to their nature there is often less information available on the treatment of adverse effects associated with
illegal drugs. In addition, new drugs emerge and quickly
become widely used – such as mephedrone in the recent
past. Toxbase is very useful in this regard. Fig. 39.2 details some of the features seen with commonly used illegal drugs.

ALCOHOL MISUSE AND
WITHDRAWAL
Alcohol is widely used throughout the world. Lifetime incidence of alcohol dependence is between 5 and 15%
in Europe; although this represents only a minority of
those who drink alcohol, the problem is huge in terms
of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. The ’CAGE’
questionnaire is commonly used as a screening tool for
alcohol problems (Fig. 39.5).

Alcohol misuse and withdrawal
Fig. 39.5 The CAGE questionnaire.

Have you ever felt you needed to Cut down on your
drinking?
Has anyone ever Annoyed you by criticizing your
drinking?
Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?
Have you ever needed a drink in the morning – an
’Eye-opener’ – to make yourself feel better?
A positive answer to any of these questions is indicative of possible
alcohol dependence.

Alcohol-related health problems
• Acute intoxication: alcohol causes euphoria and reduced inhibition. In greater quantities it may cause
reduced conscious level, respiratory depression,
atrial fibrillation, hypoglycaemia and hypotension.
• Alcohol withdrawal: tremor, sweating, tachycardia,
irritability, agitation, hallucinations, delusions,
seizures. Symptoms usually start within 24 h of last
alcohol intake.
• Gastrointestinal: gastritis, oesophagitis, varices, alcoholic liver disease (see Ch. 32).
• Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, hypertension.
• Respiratory: increased incidence of pneumonia and
TB due to reduced clearance of pathogens.
• Neurological: cortical atrophy, cerebellar degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, Wernicke’s encephalopathy/Korsakoff’s syndrome.
• Endocrine: gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy, osteoporosis.
• Increased risk of cancer particularly oesophageal and
head and neck cancers.

symptoms rather than give instructions over the telephone. The standard treatment is a course of benzodiazepines, usually chlordiazepoxide, which is slowly
reduced over several days; most hospitals have a dosing
protocol. Seizures should be treated with IV benzodiazepines if necessary, and occasionally antipsychotics such as
haloperidol are required for severe withdrawal psychosis.
Patients also require thiamine (IV in the form of Pabrinex) and investigation of any alcohol-related conditions. Fluid replacement may be difficult; dextrose
may be the most suitable IV fluid but should not be
given before the first dose of Pabrinex due to the risk
of precipitating Wernicke’s encephalopathy.

Long-term treatment
Regular psychosocial input is essential. Longer-term
managed withdrawal regimens may be needed for extremely heavy drinkers who have struggled in the past.
Once withdrawal has been completed there are three
currently recommended pharmacological aids:
• Naltrexone: a partial agonist at opioid receptors. It reduces cravings, and is usually continued for 6 months
to 1 year.
• Acamprosate: its mechanism of action is not
completely known. It reduces cravings and is continued for 6 months to 1 year if initially successful.
• Disulfiram: this causes an unpleasant reaction on ingestion of any alcohol. The patient has to be suitable
and willing to undergo treatment. Cravings are not
reduced and compliance is often poor.

SBA answers
History taking
1. B – ACE inhibitors, not AIIRBs, are implicated in chronic
cough. Nocturnal symptoms may indicate asthma
or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Voice
change may indicate malignancy. Nasal problems
are a common cause. Occupational exposure to
irritants may cause cough.

tension pneumothorax requiring emergency
management. Expansion and breath sounds
are reduced on the side of the pneumothorax.
The percussion note is increased: ’hyperresonance’.

The clerking

2. C – Digoxin may affect colour vision. Nitrofurantoin,
amiodarone, cytotoxics and methotrexate may
cause lung fibrosis. Amiodarone may cause a slategrey skin change. The patient should be told to
report any colour vision change after starting
ethambutol.

1. B – In certain cases it is better to change the order to
emphasize more relevant features.

3. B – 30 ¼ 1.5 packs per day multiplied by 25
years ¼ 37.5 pack years.

1. A – D-dimer is a sensitive but non-specific test. With a
low-risk score it can be used to exclude PE. RBBB
supports the diagnosis, indicating right heart strain,
but does not confirm it. Underlying lung disease
makes perfusion scans difficult to interpret.
Troponin level may rise slightly as the right ventricle
is stressed. Under normal circumstances, after a
negative CTPA no other tests are needed and an
alternative diagnosis should be considered.

Examination
1. E – Clubbing may occur in lung cancer or with chronic
suppurative lung disease, e.g. bronchiectasis.
Koilonychia is a sign of iron deficiency. Osler’s
nodes are a feature of endocarditis. Asterixis also
occurs in other forms of encephalopathy, e.g.
carbon dioxide retention.
2. A – Fasciculation would suggest an LMN lesion.
Wasting may occur with UMN lesions due to disuse
but it is predominantly an LMN sign.
3. D – Pulsus paradoxus is an exaggeration of the normal
change in pulse volume with the respiratory cycle.
4. E – The presence or absence of bowel sounds does
not help. Dullness to percussion and a palpable
notch are characteristic of the spleen. If the
mass is a kidney you should be able to palpate
between the mass and costal margin. Kidneys
are ballotable.
5. A – A venous pulsation cannot be felt. JVP normally falls
with inspiration; Kussmaul’s sign in cardiac
tamponade is a paradoxical rise of the JVP in
inspiration. The normal JVP has an ‘a’ and a ‘v’
wave. As the patient reclines the JVP moves higher
in the neck. ’e’ describes the hepatojugular reflex.
6. B – This is Hamman’s sign and occurs occasionally
with left-sided pneumothoraces and also in
pneumomediastinum. Tracheal deviation suggests a

Investigations

2. C – Bicarbonate is retained by the kidney in metabolic
compensation. Rising CO2 levels lower the pH.
Normal CO2 indicates that oxygenation is the
problem but ventilation is adequate. Raised anion
gap occurs for instance with lactic acidosis.
3. E – Increased QRS duration suggests ventricular
conduction delay. PR interval is measured from
the beginning of the P wave. Normal axis is from
30 to þ90 C suggests P pulmonale. Q waves in
II, III and a VF suggest previous inferior infarction.
4. D – Beta-thalassaemia trait causes reduced MCV.
Pernicious anaemia causes vitamin B12 deficiency
and megaloblastic anaemia. Chronic renal failure
causes anaemia with normal MCV.
5. C – Polycythaemia does not increase the ESR and may
lower it.
6. C – Renal impairment causes hypocalcaemia. RCC may
cause hypercalcaemia, mainly by metastasis to
bone. Other causes of lytic lesions in bone are lung,
breast, thyroid and prostatic malignancy. In milkalkali syndrome there is increased calcium intake. In
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism biochemistry is
normal.

7. B – High alkaline phosphatase and GGT traditionally
indicate obstructive biliary disease. Urea-tocreatinine ratio is also increased in simple
dehydration. D-dimer will be elevated in VTE, but
remember that many things elevate the D-dimer
and a negative result is more useful. Creatine
kinase is released when skeletal muscle is
damaged. HbA1c is used to monitor therapy.

(e.g. simvastatin) and aspirin all individually reduce
mortality. Although fibrates are effective in
reducing both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides,
there is insufficient mortality data for these agents.
An angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g. losartan) is
only indicated if the patient does not tolerate an
ACE inhibitor. Warfarin is not indicated in
isolated ACS.

8. D – The short synacthen test looks for cortisol deficiency.
Cortisol should rise with synacthen in normal
individuals. The dexamethasone suppression test
is performed overnight. A long synacthen test or
ACTH level is needed to determine the cause.

5. C – Digoxin is indicated in sinus rhythm as it improves
symptoms (RADIANCE trial). The New York Heart
Association classification is used to classify the
degree of failure on the basis of symptoms.
Diuretics improve symptoms, but have no
mortality benefit, whereas ACE inhibitors improve
both morbidity and mortality. Left ventricular
failure predisposes to arrhythmias, especially if the
ventricle is dilated.

9. E – Kerley B lines are visible at the periphery in
pulmonary oedema.

Cardiovascular disorders
1. A – Mitral regurgitation is commonly loudest at the
apex and radiates to the axilla. There is no
presystolic accentuation in the context of AF due to
the absence of atrial contraction. Left-sided heart
murmurs are best heard in expiration, right-sided
best in inspiration (due to decreased venous
return). Aortic regurgitation is best heard at the left
sternal edge in expiration with the patient sitting
up. An opening snap is a feature of mitral stenosis.
2. D – Patients aged under 55 should be started on an ACE
inhibitor. Although lifestyle changes should be
advised, if the blood pressure is persistently over
160 mmHg systolic medical therapy is indicated,
especially in the context of diabetes. If monotherapy is unsuccessful, a calcium channel blocker
should be added. If the blood pressure remains high
on this a diuretic, such as bendroflumethiazide,
would be the third agent. Beta-blockers, such as
atenolol, are now only used if the blood pressure
remains raised despite the use of the above agents.
Diabetic control is crucial, but does not reduce the
blood pressure.
3. E – Although aortic stenosis can cause a narrow pulse
pressure, the absolute value is unhelpful in
assessing degree of stenosis. The murmur may help
in the initial diagnosis, either its severity or
radiation are an indicator of clinical significance (as
a matter of fact in critical aortic stenosis there may
be no murmur due to the severe impairment of
flow). Left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG
indicates functionally important aortic stenosis.
4. B – All acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients should
be on secondary prevention for atherosclerotic
disease. The evidence shows an ACE inhibitor (e.g.
ramipril), a beta-blocker (e.g. atenolol), a statin

430

6. C – Although rheumatic fever may indeed result in atrial
fibrillation, in the UK ischaemic heart disease and
hypertension are far more common causes of AF.
Atrial contraction contributes 10–30% of ventricular
filling and AF may therefore cause heart failure on
the background of existing heart disease.
Anticoagulation with either aspirin or warfarin
should be instigated in any patient with AF unless
contraindications exist. The ECG changes associated
with AF are absent P waves and irregular, narrow
QRS complexes. Pulmonary embolism is a
cause of AF.
7. E – The delta wave described in this clinical scenario
is pathognomonic for Wolff–Parkinson–White
syndrome (WPW). WPW is a form of
atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia since the reentry circuit is not through the AV node. The rate
described is unlikely to be atrial flutter as this tends to
be multiples of 75 depending on the degree of block.
Ventricular fibrillation is not compatible with life.
8. A – It is measured from the sternal angle (the angle of
Louis – the angle formed between the manubrium
and sternum). Answers B–E are all true.
9. A – This lady has suffered an NSTEMI. She will be at
high risk of subsequent MI and death (GRACE
score) in light of her age, co-morbidities and
troponin elevation. Cardiac catheterization is thus
indicated as an inpatient. This investigation will be
able to show the culprit lesion, but also allows for
revascularization at the same time. Investigations
that stress the myocardium (e.g. ETT or
radionuclide perfusion scanning) in patients that
have been admitted with an NSTEMI are
contraindicated. Echocardiography may show the
extent of the damage by the ischaemic event, but
offers no treatment potential. 24-h ECH
monitoring has no role in this clinical setting.

SBA answers
10. E – Essential hypertension is the same as primary
hypertension. This idiopathic condition is
responsible for 95% of cases of hypertension.
Conn’s syndrome (hyperaldosteronism),
phaeochromocytoma (catecholamineproducing tumour), coarctation of the aorta
and renal artery stenosis are all causes of
secondary hypertension.
11. B – A slow rising pulse is a feature of aortic stenosis.
The character of the pulse should be assessed
centrally (e.g. carotid – ensure to check one side
at a time!). Pulsus alternans is the physical finding
of a variable pulse waveform of strong and weak
beats – a feature of ventricular impairment.
Venous return is decreased during inspiration
which causes reduced vagal tone and results in an
increased heart rate.

Respiratory disease
1. A – A tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency
that requires immediate decompression (largebore cannula in the second intercostal space, midclavicular line). It is a clinical diagnosis based on the
following features on examination. The trachea is
deviated away from the affected side. There will be
no breath sounds and a hyperresonant percussion
note on the affected side. When the tension
pneumothorax becomes sufficiently large to
compromise cardiovascular function, venous
return to the heart will be impaired, resulting in a
raised JVP.
2. D – Tachycardia is a common finding in pulmonary
embolism and the most common ECG abnormality.
Although the S1 Q3 T3 pattern is often mentioned
in textbooks, it is encountered in <20% of
pulmonary embolism cases. Haemoptysis may
well be a feature; the most common symptom
is pleuritic chest pain. Treatment depends on
the cause and ranges from 6 months of
LMWH (as would be the case here) to lifelong
warfarin.
3. C – In severe asthma, IV magnesium may be beneficial.
Peak flow is a helpful tool, especially when
compared to the patient’s normal performance, in
predicting severity. Peak flow values of <33% of
normal indicate a life-threatening asthma attack.
Blood gases are a particularly important tool in the
assessment of severe asthma. A normal PCO2 is
suggestive the patient is getting tired (it should be
low due to hyperventilation) and is not reassuring
at all. Death is not uncommon. There is no evidence
to support the use of IV bronchodilators over
nebulized equivalents.

4. B – The CURB65 score is used to assess severity for
community-acquired pneumonia. Confusion,
defined as an abbreviated mini mental test score of
<8, scores 1 point. A serum urea of >7 mmol/L
scores 1 point. A systolic blood pressure of
<90 mmHg scores 1 point. A respiratory rate of
>30 scores 1 point. Age >65 scores 1 point.
A score of 0–1 is mild pneumonia, 2 is moderate
and 3–5 is severe. Typically, mild pneumonia is
treated in the community, moderate potentially in
hospital and severe definitely in hospital commonly
with IV antibiotics.
5. B – Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
secretion and Eaton–Lambert myasthenia
syndrome are both associated with small-cell lung
cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma may produce
parathyroid-related peptide causing
hypercalcaemia. The mainstay of treatment is
surgery, although patients often present with
metastases which commonly occur in bone, the
adrenal glands, brain and liver.
6. A – Amiodarone may cause lower zone pulmonary
fibrosis, particularly in the context of pre-existing
lung disease. Other causes of lower zone fibrosis
are rheumatoid arthritis, asbestosis, idiopathic and
drugs such as methotrexate and nitrofurantoin.
7. E – There are 4 stages of chest X-ray changes
associated with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Answer B is
stage 1, answer C is stage 2, answer E is stage 3 and
answer D is stage 4. Pleural effusions are not a
feature in this classification.
8. C – The scenario described above is one of a lifethreatening asthma attack. The most important
features here are the considerable length of the
attack and the apparent lack of effective
ventilation. In the acute setting the CO2 would be
low, with an associated respiratory alkalosis,
(answers D and E) due to hyperventilation.
Once the patient gets tired the PCO2 will be in the
normal range (this is a bad sign) and the pH will
subsequently normalize. If ICU/HDU input is
sought at this point, the patient will deteriorate and
develop type II respiratory failure.
9. E – Although the fraction of inspired oxygen is highly
dependent on respiratory rate and oxygen flow
rate through the delivery system, it is useful to have
some rough idea of the concentrations of oxygen
given. Inspired room air has FiO2 of 21%, whereas
a non-rebreath mask at 15 L/min is as close to an
FiO2 of 100% as possible. Venturi masks have
special valves that closely regulate the FiO2 and are
commonly available at concentrations of 28%,
35% and 40%. A simple facemask delivering
oxygen at 5 L/min roughly delivers FiO2 of 50%.

SBA answers
10. C – Routine use of inhaled corticosteroids is only
indicated if FEV1 <50% with 2 exacerbations per
year. All the other answers have proven benefit in
COPD.
11. E – The condition is usually caused by industrial
asbestos exposure and may therefore result in
compensation for the patient and/or family. It is a
tumour of the pleura rather than the lung
parenchyma. Associated pulmonary asbestosis is
only found in approximately 15% of cases. The
prognosis is poor.
12. A – Although a raised body mass index (BMI) is a risk
factor for obstructive sleep apnoea, the condition
is seen in patients with a normal BMI.
Management is conservative in first instance
(sleep hygiene, weight loss, alcohol avoidance,
etc.) and positive pressure airway support,
although surgery may be indicated if these fail.
The condition causes excessive daytime
sleepiness, which can be assessed by the Epworth
sleepiness score. Hypertension and possibly
coronary artery disease are associated with
obstructive sleep apnoea. The condition can be
central (i.e. a reduced respiratory drive), due to
collapse of the airway (e.g. the soft palate), or a
combination of both.

Gastroenterology
1. C – Barrett’s oesophagus is usually asymptomatic. Less
than 1% progress to adenocarcinoma per year. It is
characterized by metaplasia from squamous to
columnar epithelium in the distal part of the
oesophagus. The underlying cause is gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) which is
typically managed medically with lifestyle changes,
and proton pump inhibitors.
2. B – Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the
pancreas most commonly caused by alcohol or
gallstones. The history of intermittent RUQ pain is
suggestive of biliary colic in a female in her forties.
The likelihood is thus that this is gallstone
pancreatitis. Severity can be assessed using the
modified Glasgow or APACHE-II scoring systems.
The Rockall score is used to predict mortality in
gastrointestinal bleeding. Pseudocyst formation is
not an early complication – it tends to occur after
2–6 weeks. Although a serum amylase of 1400 U/
mL is high, occasionally a perforated viscus may
present in a similar manner with serum amylase
concentrations >1000 U/mL.
3. E – A large upper GI bleed is a medical emergency and
should be initially managed according to advanced

432

life support principles of Airway, Breathing and
Circulation. Fluid resuscitation is a priority. Blood
results may show a raised urea (secondary to red
cell ingestion) and may initially show a normal
haemoglobin concentration as there has been no
chance for haemodilution in the very acute setting.
The investigation of choice is an
oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Re-bleeding
carries an immediate mortality of 40%.
4. B – Transmural inflammation, perianal lesions and skip
lesions are all features of Crohn’s disease. UC is less
common in smokers, the converse of which is true
for Crohn’s disease. Pseudopolyps are associated
with UC.
5. D – The symptoms described here are suggestive of a
left-sided tumour. The more distal the disease the
more likely it is to cause a change in bowel habit.
Tenesmus is suggestive of rectal disease. Rightsided tumours typically present late and may
present as iron-deficiency anaemia. More than
90% of tumours can be resected surgically.
6. D – Pseudomembranous colitis is a serious infection,
commonly hospital acquired. It is caused by the
toxins produced by Clostridium difficile. As is the
case for all forms of colitis, toxic dilatation of the
colon is a complication. Diagnosis of C. difficile
infection is made by toxin-positive stool culture,
pseudomembranous colitis is diagnosed
endoscopically. Prevention is predominantly
through hand washing using soap and water (to
eliminate the bacterial spores) and careful use of
antibiotics. Initial treatment is with oral
metronidazole or oral vancomycin.
7. D – IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion that can only be
made once organic causes have been excluded
(such as coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, etc.). The condition is more common in
females between the ages of 20 and 40. Symptoms
are central or lower abdominal pain, commonly
relieved by defecation, abdominal bloating and
altered bowel habit. Rectal bleeding is not a
feature. Treatment may require input from
dieticians, surgeons, psychiatrists or gynaecologists
and is not always successful.
8. B – Gallstones are commonly asymptomatic. Their
incidence increases with age, parity, raised BMI
and they are more common in females.
Occasionally, a large gallstone can erode through
the gallbladder into the adjacent duodenum,
causing a gallstone ileus. A minority of gallstones
are radio-opaque owing to their composition: they
commonly contain cholesterol and/or bile salts.
Charcot’s triad (RUQ pain, jaundice and rigors) is
suggestive of cholangitis.

SBA answers
9. C – Hepatitis A may relapse, but does not cause
chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis B transmission is
parenteral and infection may be complicated by
hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C is usually
asymptomatic in the acute phase. Hepatitis E is
transmitted via the faecal-oral route.

in lupus nephritis, membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinaemia and
infective-endocarditis-associated
glomerulonephritis. ANCA and anti-GM antibodies
are associated with glomerulonephritis and is a
treatable cause.

10. D – Intussusception affects children more commonly
than adults. In 20% of cases there may be
redcurrant jelly stool, although this is a late sign.
Melaena is stool containing metabolized blood
(indicating an upper gastrointestinal bleed). Fatty
stool (or steatorrhoea) or putty-coloured stool is a
feature of obstructive jaundice or chronic
pancreatitis. Watery stool is common in
gastroenteritis.

5. A – Non-oliguric AKI occurs, but is less common. Prerenal renal impairment is the most common cause
for AKI, particularly in the hospital setting.
Hypovolaemia is a cause of pre-renal renal
impairment. AKI has a significant mortality,
particularly when associated with other organ
impairment (>50 %). Approximately two-thirds of
patients regain normal renal function. An early
ultrasound scan is important in excluding postrenal (obstructive) causes.

11. A – Although portal hypertension and
hypoalbuminaemia have some effect on fluid
retention, renal sodium handling has the greatest
effect. It is thought that aldosterone plays an
important role in the mechanism and it may be
that renal sensitivity to aldosterone is enhanced in
liver cirrhosis. There is no suggestion of IVC or
lymphatic obstruction in this clinical scenario.

Genitourinary disorders
1. B – Pulmonary oedema, severe acidosis, resistant
hyperkalaemia and symptomatic uraemia are all
indications for emergency haemodialysis/
haemofiltration in the context of AKI. Serum
creatinine is used as a marker of renal function, but
raised levels are not an indication for
haemodialysis/haemofiltration.
2. D – ECG changes associated with hyperkalaemia are
tented T waves, small or absent P waves, broad
QRS complexes and, eventually, sinusoidal
waveform (this is commonly followed by
ventricular fibrillation and needs IMMEDIATE
senior input and management). U waves are seen
on an ECG in association with hypokalaemia (as
well as depressed ST segments).
3. B – Haematuria is not a feature of nephrotic syndrome
(it is a feature of nephritic syndrome). High serum
cholesterol, low albumin, significant proteinuria
and oval fat bodies in the urine are all features of
nephrotic syndrome.
4. A – A KUB X-ray is not indicated in this case. The
preferred initial imaging modality would be
ultrasound scan (potentially with a renal biopsy).
Urine microscopy would be used to look for red cell
casts which are pathognomonic for glomerular
bleeding. Immunoelectrophoresis is used to
exclude myeloma. Hypocomplementaemia occurs

6. E – CKD is commonly caused by hypertension; of
course it may also be a result of CKD. Proteinuria is
a poor indicator of disease progression as patients
tend to experience a faster decline in renal
function. Blood pressure should be maintained at
130/80 mmHg to reduce the rate of glomerular
damage. Decreased production or erythropoietin
combined with impaired iron utilization results in
normochromic normocytic anaemia. Impaired
renal excretion of potassium and phosphate must
be balanced by decreased oral intake.
7. D – This is the classical presentation of pyelonephritis.
Midstream urine (MSU) should be dipsticked and
subsequently sent for microscopy culture and
sensitivities. Any female of childbearing age
presenting with abdominal pain must have a
pregnancy scan to rule out an ectopic pregnancy.
The preferred imaging modalities would be a
DMSA scan or an ultrasound scan – an abdominal
X-ray would not be indicated in this scenario. A full
blood count would be likely to show a raised white
cell count in keeping with infection.
8. A – Females are at increased risk of UTI as a result of a
shorter urethra with its meatus closer to the anus.
The condition will affect 25–35% of women at
least once. UTIs are commonly asymptomatic, the
management of which is controversial. Infection is
a frequent and dangerous complication of urinary
catheterization. A simple UTI may ascend the
ureters and cause pyelonephritis.
9. C – The most likely diagnosis is indometacin-induced
interstitial nephritis. The diagnosis would be
confirmed by renal biopsy. Indometacin should be
stopped, and the patient might benefit from oral
steroids. Membranous nephropathy may present
like this, but is not normally associated with surgical
procedures. Acute tubular necrosis is often due to
prolonged hypotension, of which there is no

433

SBA answers
suggestion in this clinical scenario. There is nothing
in the history to suggest lupus nephritis. Minimalchange nephropathy is unlikely to be caused by a
relatively minor orthopaedic procedure and
indometacin.

Neurology
1. E – Facial weakness is usually due to an UMN lesion
which spares the forehead. As this patient is on
warfarin, CT scan is required urgently to rule out
haemorrhage. If haemorrhage is present and the
INR is raised, warfarin should be reversed with
prothrombin complex concentrate. Ischaemic
strokes can occur in patients on warfarin if the INR
is subtherapeutic for a prolonged period of time, or
occasionally if the INR is therapeutic. Haemorrhage
accounts for around 20% of strokes.
2. C – Meningitis is not as likely as migraine – the patient is
afebrile and the visual symptoms would be atypical.
A minority of subarachnoid haemorrhages are
preceded by a ’sentinel bleed’ but visual warning
symptoms are not typical. Beta-blockers are
sometimes used for migraine prophylaxis. Patients
with cluster headache are typically restless, as
opposed to those with migraine. Triptans are
effective for acute migraine.
3. B – Symptoms are asymmetrical in onset; symmetrical
onset implies an alternative diagnosis such as the
Parkinson’s plus syndromes. He is young, and a
dopamine agonist is often preferred as first line in
younger patients. A radio-iodine scan may be
helpful if the diagnosis is in doubt, but is not
required. Rigidity is one of the cardinal features of
parkinsonism, the others being tremor,
bradykinesia and postural instability.
4. D – Optic neuritis is commonly due to MS, but it can
occur in isolation or be due to other pathologies
such as infection or vasculitis. Colour vision is
usually affected more. In 90% of patients the
vision gradually improves over weeks to months
following the initial event. The risk of developing
MS following an episode of optic neuritis is higher if
white matter lesions are present on MRI. MS
typically occurs between the ages of 20 and 40.
5. E – The purpuric rash is most likely to occur in
meningococcal infection. Streptococcus
pneumoniae is a common cause but does not
usually cause a purpuric rash. Listeria is more
common in the elderly, alcoholics and the
newborn. Lumbar puncture is required but not
immediately, and the presence of severe headache,
confusion and vomiting should warn you of raised

434

ICP. Treatment with IV
ceftriaxone or benzylpenicillin is urgently
required along with supportive measures and
notification of ITU.
6. D – It is commonly referred to as a ’false localizing sign’.
The headache is typically worse in the morning.
The Cushing reflex is a late sign consisting of
hypertension and bradycardia. Fundoscopy
should be performed to look for papilloedema
if raised ICP is suspected. Nausea and vomiting
may occur; abdominal pain is not a feature.
7. E – MND is slightly more common in men. It does not
affect the sensory nerves or the extraocular
muscles. Prognosis is poor; survival beyond 5
years is very rare. It usually causes a mixture of
upper and motor neurone signs.
8. C – Mortality of subarachnoid haemorrhage is 50%.
Only 30% are preceded by a sentinel headache.
As well as hydrocephalus, other causes of
worsening GCS are vasospasm and re-bleeding.
Treatment is with good fluid intake, analgesia
and nimodipine. Neurosurgery may be required.
9. C – Metastases are more common than primary
tumours. If primary tumour is suspected,
stereotactic biopsy is required. Meningiomas,
when small, can be simply observed. Surgery is
often successful. Glioblastomas are aggressive
tumours with a poor prognosis. Breast cancer, as
well as lung and skin cancer, commonly
metastasizes to the brain.
10. E – Syncope on exertion should prompt investigations
to look for aortic stenosis or hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Urinary incontinence and a few
jerks/twitches are commonly seen during
syncope. ECG is mandatory and may reveal
arrhythmia. Biting the side of the tongue is
suggestive of a seizure.

Endocrinology
1. C – A, normal; B, further testing required; C, diabetes;
D, impaired glucose tolerance; E, impaired fasting
glucose.
2. D – Antibiotics are often required for underlying
infection, which is a common cause of DKA.
Patients are usually very dehydrated and correcting
the fluid balance is the priority. In young patients,
particularly, overzealous fluid replacement can
precipitate cerebral oedema. Compensatory
hyperventilation (Kussmaul respiration) to ’blow
off’ carbon dioxide is commonly seen. The
diagnosis requires demonstration of acidosis,
ketosis and diabetes.

SBA answers
3. D – Type 1 diabetes requires treatment with
subcutaneous insulin and is usually treated
with a basal-bolus regimen of four injections
per day. The aim is an HbA1c between 6.5
and 7.5%. Type 2 diabetes can initially be
managed with oral medication. Metformin is
first line but contraindicated in renal failure.
Sulphonylureas often cause weight gain.
4. E – Osteoporosis is not painful until a fracture is
sustained. It is more common in women.
Calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase
should be normal. A T-score of less than 2.5
is diagnostic.
5. A – Sarcoidosis is one cause of hypercalcaemia.
Malignancy, including myeloma, is a common
cause. Even if the calcium quickly returns to
normal with treatment, it is important to
find the underlying cause. Ionized calcium is
the relevant value, and correction for the
albumin level should be done. Hydration
alone may normalize the calcium level;
bisphosphonates are required if rehydration
is insufficient.
6. A – If present, the visual field defect is a bitemporal
hemianopia in acromegaly. Prognathism is
common. Hypogonadism and hyperglycaemia
are common.
7. B – A mildly macrocytic anaemia is often seen.
Viral thyroiditis can cause transient
hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism.
Treating a patient with concurrent
hypoadrenalism with thyroxine can precipitate
an Addisonian crisis. Myxoedema coma is rare
but mortality is up to 20%.
8. B – Autoimmune destruction is most common in
the developed world; worldwide, infection,
especially TB, is more common. Diagnosis is made
with the short synacthen test. Rehydration,
correction of electrolyte abnormalities and
replacement of cortisol with hydrocortisone are
most important in crisis. In the long term, most
patients also require fludrocortisone.
Hyperpigmentation is seen in Addison’s, but there
is an association with vitiligo.
9. A – Sinus tachycardia is also common. Menhorrhagia
occurs in hypothyroidism; thyrotoxicosis causes
amenorrhoea. Pretibial myxoedema, proptosis
and clubbing (thyroid acropachy) are all specific
to Graves’ disease.
10. D – ADH (also called arginine vasopressin) is
synthesized predominantly in the hypothalamus
and released by the posterior pituitary. The main
hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary are
TSH, ACTH, GH, LH and FSH.

Rheumatology and skin
1. B – Obstructive lung disease is not caused by
rheumatoid arthritis; all the other options are
potential complications. In lung fibrosis,
spirometry shows a restrictive pattern.
2. C – Bamboo spine is seen in advanced ankylosing
spondylitis. Heberden’s nodes and Bouchard’s
nodes are osteophytic outgrowth in osteoarthritis
over the distal and proximal interphalangeal
joints, respectively. Telescoping of the digits is
seen in psoriatic arthritis mutilans.
3. A – Soft tissue thickening is sometimes seen as a
feature of rheumatoid arthritis, but soft tissue is
poorly visualized on plain X-ray. The others are
classical findings of OA on plain X-ray.
4. D – Anti-TNF therapy is used for autoimmune
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Weight
loss, physiotherapy and NSAIDs may give
symptomatic benefit. The condition is likely to
progress and he may require joint replacement.
5. E – Dairy products do not precipitate gout and may
protect against it. The other four factors are
recognized precipitants.
6. C – The symptoms should make you think of
ankylosing spondylitis, and ANCA is unlikely to be
helpful here – it is used when a vasculitis is
suspected. HLA-B27 is present in over 90% of
patients with AS and provides useful further
evidence. Plain X-rays may show characteristic
changes; if not, MRI can detect early sacroiliitis.
ESR is usually raised in inflammatory conditions
but will be normal in mechanical back pain.
7. B – Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are seen in
autoimmune hepatitis. Anti-Sm (Smith) and antidsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE. ANA
is present at a raised titre in almost all cases.
Photosensitive rash is typical. Abnormalities on
the full blood count include leukopenia, anaemia
and thrompcytopenia. Seizures and psychosis
may occur.
8. A – The ’C’ in CREST syndrome stands for
calcinosis cutis, when calcium is deposited in
the skin.
9. B – Erythematous plaques over extensor surfaces
with a silvery scale are typical of psoriasis. Benzoyl
peroxide is used to treat acne. Anti-TNF therapy
is used for severe psoriasis when other
treatments fail.
10. C – Along with rapid enlargement, bleeding/
crusting, sensory change, diameter >7 mm and
indistinct border, satellite lesions help identify
malignancy. Metastasis to lungs, liver and brain is

435

SBA answers
common. The prognosis is worse for scalp or neck
lesions. Excision is the only curative treatment and
cure rates are good for early lesions.

Haematology
1. E – The picture is of iron deficiency anaemia. Ferritin is
usually low, though it may be normal as it is an
acute phase reactant. TIBC is raised. Iron deficiency
anaemia only occurs once bone marrow stores of
iron have been exhausted. The reticulocyte count
is usually normal in IDA. Platelet count is often
raised due to ongoing bleeding.
2. A – Painful crises are caused by vaso-occlusion and can
be precipitated by infection, cold, hypoxia and
dehydration. Adequate analgesia should be given,
including opiates. Haemoglobin of 8 may well be
normal in this patient; transfusion may be required
at some point but does not need to be given
urgently if the anaemia is well tolerated.
Sequestration crisis is only seen in children as the
spleen undergoes infarction in most patients by the
time they are teenagers.
3. D – Haemolysis following ingestion of fava beans
(broad beans) is typical of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency. In haemolytic anaemia
LDH is raised and the reticulocyte count increases.
Howell–Jolly bodies are seen in hyposplenism.
Infection and drugs are other common
precipitants.
4. E – It is associated with promyelocytic leukaemia
(AML-M3) as well as some other malignancies.
When seen in malignancy it is occasionally
more mild and chronic than in acute disease.
D-dimer is elevated and fibrinogen is low due to
consumption. Gram-negative sepsis and obstetric
complications are other common causes.
Supportive measures are the mainstay of
treatment.

8. E – Isotope bone scan. This will not detect the
lesions of myeloma, which appear as ’punchedout’ holes on plain X-ray. SFLCA is more sensitive
than urine electrophoresis but may not be
universally available. Bone marrow examination
will give an estimate of the proportion of plasma
cells and will confirm the diagnosis.
9. D – Secondary polycythaemia is commonly caused by
chronic hypoxia, such as in COPD. The JAK2
mutation is present in 95% of patients with PV,
but fewer of those with ET or MF. In CML the
causative abnormality is the Philadelphia
chromosome, a translocation. First-line treatment
is with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. ET
carries the best prognosis of these disorders.
10. D – ADAMTS-13 antibodies are present in
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and are
not commonly tested for.

Infectious diseases
1. D – Piperacillin is a penicillin and is not effective
against MRSA. The other antibiotics are
commonly used against MRSA but resistance
to some of them, such as vancomycin, is
increasing.
2. B – Primaquine. He requires eradication therapy for
hypnozoites that occur with P. vivax and P. ovale.
The other agents are used in treatment of the
acute illness.
3. C – HIV is an RNA retrovirus. Vertical transmission is
common, but the risk can be lowered with
antiretrovirals and avoiding breastfeeding.
Seroconversion is asymptomatic in a minority of
patients. Kaposi sarcoma is a late-stage
complication. Combination therapy is used.
4. D – Streptococcus pyogenes is a group A streptococcus
which often causes skin or soft tissue infection,
sometimes invasive, and strep throat.

5. B – Haemophilia A and B are X-linked conditions and
hence affect males almost exclusively. Von
Willebrand’s disease presents like platelet
deficiency with mucosal and skin bleeding. It is
treated with plasma-derived factor VIII. Bleeding in
haemophilia A and B is treated with recombinant
factor VIII and IX, respectively.

5. C – The risk of hepatitis B transmission following a
needlestick injury is up to 60% compared with a
0.3% risk of HIV transmission. HIV-1 is most
common. CD4 T-cells are mainly affected. PGL
may exist in stage 1 illness. HAART is started when
the CD4 count is less than 350.

6. A – Excision of a whole lymph node gives information
about the type of cells present and the lymph node
architecture. FNA is often insufficient. Full-body
CT scan and bone marrow examination are needed
to stage the disease. PET scan is becoming more
widely used for staging.

Toxicology

7. B – Auer rods are seen in acute myeloid leukaemia.

Stridor is an inspiratory noise resulting from tracheal
compression. A thyroid goitre may displace the
trachea but as it is in the midline this may be either to
the left or right.
The trachea is pushed away by the increasing
pressure in the right hemithorax.
Scarred fibrotic tissue pulls the trachea towards itself.
Airflow obstruction during expiration causes a
polyphonic expiratory wheeze.
The fluid causes a stony dull percussion note and
reduced air entry. Expansion may also be reduced.

The sudden onset suggests a vascular cause. Loss of
consciousness is uncommon in strokes unless the
brainstem is affected. This may occur in brainstem
stroke or from the pressure effects of huge
infarction or haemorrhage.
The sudden onset again suggests a vascular
cause and in this context the subhyaloid
haemorrhages are pathognomonic of
subarachnoid haemorrhage.
The most likely explanation is an opiate overdose.
This could be assessed by giving the patient
naloxone (an opiate antagonist).
Decompensated liver disease often causes

The suspected diagnosis is acromegaly. A useful
screening test is IGF-1 levels. An isolated
measurement of growth hormone level is not
useful.
Investigations directed at finding an endocrine
cause for suspected hypoglycaemic episodes are
usually negative. However, the only way to exclude
an insulinoma is to conduct a prolonged fast and
measure serum glucose and C-peptide levels if
symptoms occur.
Autoimmune Addison’s disease is suspected.
Administration of an exogenous
adrenocorticotrophic hormone (Synacthen) will fail
to produce an increase in serum cortisol.
His cranial diabetes insipidus will be demonstrated
by a failure to concentrate the urine during a water
deprivation test as the serum osmolality rises. If
desmopressin is administered the urine will
concentrate within an hour as the renal tubules
remain responsive to antidiuretic hormone.
Cushing’s syndrome is suspected and will be
confirmed if the administration of exogenous
steroids fails to suppress adrenal steroid synthesis.

The absence of nocturnal symptoms points to a
non-organic cause for the patient’s symptoms.
In alcoholic patients a common cause of
hospitalization is acute pancreatitis – with
repeated attacks and continued alcohol abuse
the pancreas does not secrete sufficient
enzymes and malabsorption ensues.

Achalasia is a condition of mostly unknown
aetiology characterized by a lack of relaxation in the
lower oesophageal sphincter due to degeneration of
the myenteric plexus. Dysphagia, retrosternal
cramps, regurgitation and weight loss are

Most patients with systemic sclerosis have
oesophageal involvement.
Obesity is a risk factor for GORD and the

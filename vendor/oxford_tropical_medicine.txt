Introduction
Every year >10 million children die (4 million in the first month of life).
Deaths in hospitals often occur within the first 24 h of admission, so
very sick children should be identified on arrival and appropriate
treatment instituted. Emergency triage and treatment (ETAT) is a rapid
screening process to identify children who require immediate
treatment to avert death and long-term morbidity. Treatment of sick
children must never be on a ‘first come, first served’ basis.
Among presentations to health-care facilities, children often
outnumber adults. In many low-resource settings, there is no
paediatrician and sick children are managed by non-specialists.
WHO/UNICEF developed a model of integrated management of
childhood illness (IMCI) — see box. This syndromic approach to the
triage and assessment of a sick child has successfully been used in lowresource settings. WHO also has online publications for the
management of children at the first referral level (see box).

Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)
(http://www.who.int/child-adolescent-health/integr.htm)
Of the >10 million deaths/yr that occur in children <5 years, 70% are
caused by acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, measles, and
malaria, with or without malnutrition. Most children present with
clinical features of more than one diagnosis — a single diagnosis is
therefore often impossible.
IMCI uses a syndromic approach, combining management of
individual diseases with nutrition, immunization, and maternal
health. It aims to improve the skills of health care workers (HCWs).
‘Danger signs’ are first identified. Children are then assigned defined
clinical syndromes on the basis of simple questions to the mother
and a basic clinical examination; more than one syndrome may be
assigned. The severity of each syndrome is defined and management
instituted: either urgent referral to a secondary care facility,
treatment, and advice, or advice to the parent/caregiver for home
management.
IMCI is targeted at HCWs in health centres and outpatient
departments of small hospitals. This can be extended to include
community health workers, shopkeepers, and pharmacists, who are
often the first port of call for medical advice. ICMI has improved
heath-care seeking behaviour, rational prescribing, immunization
coverage, and availability of basic equipment, and has also reduced
costs. Bigger reductions in mortality should result from combining
IMCI with key programmes such as the WHO ARI and ORT case
management strategies.

Emergency triage assessment
Immediately on presentation to a health facility (i.e. before joining a
queue), children should be rapidly triaged to:
Those with emergency signs who require immediate treatment to
prevent death.
Those with priority signs who should be assessed and treated without
delay.
Non-urgent cases that have neither emergency nor priority signs.
These follow the regular queue of non-urgent patients.
Triage should be carried out at the first point of contact; this may be
at the outpatient clinic, the emergency room, or even in a hospital
paediatric ward. All children must be assessed for these signs (as
outlined on page 6) before any routine procedures like registration and
weighing.

Emergency signs
Central cyanosis.
Severe respiratory distress.
Obstructed breathing.
Altered level of consciousness.
Convulsions.
Signs of shock.
Signs of severe dehydration in a child with
diarrhoea.
All children with emergency signs require immediate treatment to
avert death (see
p 8-13).

Priority signs
Any sick child aged <2 months.
Visible severe wasting; oedema affecting both feet.
High fever: temperature >38.5°C.
Irritability, restlessness, lethargy.
Severe palmar pallor.
Major burns.
Any respiratory distress.
Child with urgent referral note from the health
facility.
Trauma or urgent surgical condition.
Poisoning.
Severe pain.
All children with priority signs require immediate assessment and
treatment.

Signs of severe respiratory distress
Lower chest wall indrawing (Fig. 1.1).
Grunting.
Inability to speak, drink, or feed due to respiratory
distress.
Head nodding/use of accessory muscles of
respiration.
Other signs of respiratory distress
Fast breathing — ≥60 breaths/minute in infants
aged <2 months; ≥50/minute in children aged 211 months; ≥40/minute in children aged 12

months to 5 years.
Nasal flaring.
Signs of obstructed breathing
Stridor.
Weak cough.
Inability to speak.
Splinted chest.

Fig. 1.1 Lower chest wall indrawing: with inspiration the lower
chest wall moves in. (Note the distinction between lower chest
wall indrawing and intercostal recession, in which the soft tissue
between the ribs is sucked inwards on inspiration. Although
intercostal recession may occur in respiratory distress, alone, it is
not a sign of severe respiratory distress.) (Reproduced with
permission of the WHO.)

Assessment for emergency and priority signs
Follow these steps to quickly determine if there are any emergency or
priority signs:
Assess airway and breathing
Look, feel, and listen for chest movement, exhaled air, and breath
sounds by placing your ear close to the child's nostrils. Check for
respiratory distress and signs of airway obstruction (see box p 5).
Check the tongue and buccal mucosa for central cyanosis.
Note: do not move neck if cervical injury is possible e.g. following
trauma. Instead, use the jaw thrust manoeuvre to open the airway if
needed.
Assess circulation for signs of shock
Check if child's hands are cold. Assess capillary refill time (CRT) by
applying pressure to whiten the nail of the thumb or big toe for 3
seconds. Release the pressure and note how long it takes the nail
bed to refill and to turn pink; a CRT ≥3 seconds is usually a sign of
shock or dehydration. Check the pulse: if the radial pulse is not
palpable, feel for the brachial or femoral pulse in the infant, or the
carotid pulse in older children. In shock, central pulses may be weak
and rapid or absent.
Assess for coma, convulsions, or other abnormal mental status
Check if the child is continually irritable, restless, lethargic, or
convulsing. Rapidly assess level of consciousness using AVPU scale
(see box opposite) or Blantyre Coma score (
p 41).
Assess for severe dehydration if the child has diarrhoea
Check with mother if the child's eyes are unusually sunken. Assess
skin turgor by pinching the skin of the abdomen halfway between the
umbilicus and the flank. Pinch for 1 second and then observe how
the skin returns — >2 sec implies marked loss of skin turgor (see
diagram
p 249). Severe dehydration is defined as ≥2 of the

following: lethargy or unconsciousness; sunken eyes; marked loss of
skin turgor; inability to drink or drinking poorly.
Assess for signs of severe malnutrition
Examine for severe muscle wasting, especially around the ribs,
shoulders, arms, buttocks, and thighs. Examine for bilateral pedal
oedema ± other signs of kwashiorkor.
Assess for severe anaemia
Compare the colour of the child's palm with yours: if the skin is very
pale or so pale that it looks white, the child has severe palmar
pallor.
Identify all sick infants <2 months old
Assess for a major burn
Identify all children referred from another health facility

Signs of shock
Cold hands.
CRT >3 seconds.
Fast, weak pulse.
Also note
Anuria.
Hypotension — a late sign in children.
Altered level of consciousness.
Acidotic (Kussmaul) breathing 2° to poor tissue
perfusion.
AVPU scale
The AVPU scale is a quick and approximate way of rating a person's
level of consciousness:

A — Alert
V — Responds to verbal commands
P — Responds to painful stimulus. Press down firmly on the middle
fingernail with a pen, or rub your knuckles on the sternum
U — Unconscious

Emergency management of the sick child
If emergency signs are present, call for help and give emergency
treatment:

Airway & breathing
The presence of severe respiratory distress, obstructed breathing, or
central cyanosis is an emergency.
Is there a history or evidence of foreign body aspiration? If so,
manage as for a choking child (opposite page).
If foreign body aspiration NOT suspected ▶ manage airway:
Remove any foreign body from the mouth.
Clear secretions from oropharynx (use suction if available).
Open airway using head tilt and chin lift: in infants the ‘tilt’ should
be to the neutral position to avoid obstruction of the airway due to
hyperextension. In older children, tilt the head to the ‘sniffing’
position.
If inadequate or no spontaneous respiratory effort, ventilate using
bag and mask. Aim to give 40-60 breaths per minute in neonates and
a slower rate in older children. If there is also cardiac arrest
requiring chest compressions, use a ratio of 90 compressions
coordinated with 30 breaths/minute (3 compressions and 1 breath
every 2 seconds) in neonates. In older children, give external cardiac
massage at a rate of 100/minute with 2 breaths after every 15
compressions (ratio 15 compressions to 2 breaths).
Where facilities and expertise exist, endotracheal intubation should

be performed as soon as possible. However, attempted endotracheal
intubation by the inexperienced must not compromise adequate
ventilation by bag and mask.
Give oxygen and ensure child is warm.
If wheeze is present, give nebulized salbutamol.

Fig. 1.2 (A) Neutral position in infants (B) ‘Sniffing’ position in
older child. (Reproduced with permission of the WHO.)

NOTE: Unlike in adults, most arrests in young children are 1°
respiratory arrests ± 2° cardiac arrest. As a result, adequate
ventilation alone is sufficient to maintain cardiac output in most
cases, while the cause of the arrest is identified and treated.

Foreign body aspiration/choking child
If the child has an effective cough, encourage her to cough and
continually reassess for clinical deterioration or relief of the
obstruction.
If NO effective cough, or there is severe respiratory distress,
obstructed breathing, or central cyanosis, manage as for choking

child.

For infants
Give 5 back slaps using the heel of the hand as shown in Fig. 1.3.
If obstruction persists, give 5 chest thrusts using 2 fingers (Fig. 1.3).
If obstruction persists, check the infant's mouth for any obstruction
that can be removed.
If obstruction still persists, repeat this sequence, starting with back
slaps.

Fig. 1.3 Back slaps and chest thrusts to relieve airway obstruction
in a choking infant. (Reproduced with permission of the WHO.)

For children ≥1 year
Give 5 back slaps with the heel of the hand.
If obstruction persists, perform the Heimlich manoeuvre (Fig. 1.4):

stand behind the child and form a fist below the sternum with one
hand; place the other hand over the fist and pull both hands
backwards and upwards. Repeat this manoeuvre 5 times.
If obstruction persists, check the child's mouth for any obstruction
that can be removed.
If obstruction still persist, repeat this sequence starting with back
slaps.

Circulation
Shock (identified by cold hands plus either CRT >3 seconds or a fast,

weak pulse) is an emergency.
Stop any bleeding; look for severe palmar pallor => severe anaemia.
Give oxygen.
Ensure child is warm.
Insert IV line (and take blood for Hb/haematocrit and crossmatch).
If unable to establish peripheral IV access quickly, insert external
jugular or intraosseous line (Fig 1.5,
p 12).
Fluid resuscitate according to guidelines below and nutritional
status.

Management of shock in children who are NOT
severely malnourished
▶ Fluid resuscitate rapidly:
Infuse 20 ml/kg bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate as rapidly
as possible, then reassess.
If no improvement, give a second 20 ml/kg fluid bolus as rapidly as
possible, then reassess.
If still no improvement, give a third 20 ml/kg bolus as rapidly as
possible.
▶ If still no improvement after 3rd bolus:
If shock caused by profuse diarrhoea — give 20 ml/kg normal saline
or Ringer's lactate over 30 minutes.
If shock not caused by profuse diarrhoea — give 20 ml/kg blood over
30 minutes.
Reassess after fourth infusion; if still no improvement, further
management is guided by the working diagnosis.
▶ If improvement occurs at any stage (pulse slower, CRT faster):
For infants <12 months give 70 ml/kg Ringer's lactate or normal
saline over 5 h.

For children aged 1-5 years give 70 ml/kg Ringer's lactate or normal
saline over 2 ½ h.
▶ Reassess the child every 1-2 h:
Modify the infusion rate according to the clinical response.
Give ORS solution (

p 251) 5 ml/kg/h as soon as child can drink.

Reassess and classify dehydration after 6 h (infants) or after 3 h
(older children). Follow appropriate treatment plan A, B, or C for
dehydration (see Chapter 6).

Intraosseous needle insertion
Intraosseous infusion is a quick, safe, and reliable method of giving
fluid (including blood) and drugs in an emergency when it is not
possible to establish peripheral venous access. The usual site of
insertion is the proximal tibia:
Place padding under the child's knee so that it is flexed ~30° from
the straight position with the heel resting on the bed
/examination table.
Identify the insertion site 1-2 cm below the tibial tuberosity,
midway between the anterior ridge of the tibia and its medial
edge.
Use a dedicated intraosseous or bone marrow aspiration needle
(15-18 gauge or, if not available, 21 gauge); if neither available, a
large bore hypodermic or butterfly needle may be used in young
children.
Clean the skin with antiseptic solution.
Stabilize the leg by grasping the thigh and knee above and lateral
to the cannulation site with the non-dominant hand, taking care
to keep this hand away from the cannulation site to avoid
needlestick injury.
Using aseptic technique, insert the needle with the point angled
slightly away from the joint space and the bevel pointing towards
the foot.
Advance the needle using a gentle but firm, twisting or drilling

motion, until there is a sudden decrease in resistance as it enters
the marrow cavity; the needle should sit firmly in the bone.
Remove the stylet, attach a syringe, aspirate ~1 ml marrow
contents (looks like blood) and flush with normal saline to confirm
the needle is in the marrow cavity. Blood from the marrow
aspirate may also be sent for full blood count, biochemistry,
malaria slide, and crossmatch.
Apply dressing and secure needle in place. It is now ready to use.
Stop the intraosseous infusion as soon as venous access is
available.

Contraindications:
infection at the site of insertion; fracture of the bone.

Alternative sites of insertion:
Distal femur, 2 cm above the lateral condyle (~1-2 cm proximal to
the superior border of the patella), slightly lateral to the anterior
ridge.
Distal tibia, ~1-2 cm proximal to the medial malleolus in the centre
of the bone.

Management of shock in children with severe
malnutrition
Signs of shock and dehydration are less reliable in children with
severe malnutrition. These children are at risk of fluid overload and
death from heart failure.
▶ Resuscitate with IV fluids as follows only if the child is lethargic or
unconscious:
Weigh the child (or estimate weight) to calculate fluid requirements.
Record pulse and respiratory rate.
Assess and treat hypoglycaemia (see below).
Infuse 15 ml/kg IV fluid over 1 hour. Use (in order of preference)
Ringer's lactate with 5% glucose, or half-normal saline with 5%

glucose, or half-strength Darrow's solution with 5% glucose. Use
Ringer's lactate if none of these are available.
Monitor pulse and respiratory rate every 5-10 minutes.
If child deteriorates during IV rehydration (respiratory rate increases
by 5/min or heart rate by 15/min), stop the infusion.

Fig. 1.5 Introaosseous needle insertion. (Reproduced with
permission of the WHO.)

▶ If there are signs of improvement (pulse & respiratory rates fall):

Repeat 15 ml/kg IV bolus over 1 hour.
Then switch to oral or NG rehydration with ReSoMal (
ml/kg/h up to 10 h.

p 251) 10

▶ If there are still no signs of improvement:
Assume the child has septic shock.
Give maintenance IV fluids (4 ml/kg/hr) while waiting for blood.
Transfuse 10 ml/kg fresh whole blood slowly over 3 h; give packed
cells if in heart failure.
Start frequent small feeds with F-75 or alternative low lactose and
low osmolarity preparation (
Chapter 17).
▶ In all cases, proceed to full assessment and management of severe
malnutrition, including broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (Chapter 6).

Children with severe anaemia and shock
▶ Do not delay fluid resuscitation — resuscitate as required per
guidelines above while awaiting blood for transfusion.
Obtain blood for Hb/haematocrit, crossmatch (+ malaria slide in
endemic areas) in all children with severe palmar pallor.
If Hb<4 g/dl/haematocrit <12%, or Hb result not available quickly
and clinical signs of severe anaemia, substitute saline/Ringer's
solution with 20-30 ml/kg blood in the above guidelines.
In the presence of very severe palmar pallor and shock, consider
urgent transfusion with O negative blood.

Coma and convulsions
The presence of coma or convulsions is an emergency.
▶ Manage airway (see
▶ If convulsing:

p 8)

Give diazepam 0.5 mg/kg rectally.
If still convulsing after 10 minutes, give a 2nd dose of diazepam 0.5
mg/kg rectally, or diazepam 0.25 mg/kg IV.
If still convulsing after a further 10 mins, give paraldehyde 0.3-0.4
ml/kg rectally, or phenobarbital 15 mg/kg IV or IM (in infants <2
weeks old, give phenobarbital 20 mg/kg).
To prevent aspiration, avoid oral medications until the convulsions
have terminated and the child is alert.
▶ If unconscious:
Position in the left lateral ‘recovery’ position. If head or neck
trauma is suspected, stabilize the neck first and keep the child lying
on the back.
Tepid sponge if high fever.
Assess and treat hypoglycaemia (see below).

Hypoglycaemia
▶ Assess and treat hypoglycaemia:
If lethargic or unconscious, measure blood glucose. If unable to
measure glucose quickly, or if blood glucose <2.5 mmol/l in a well
nourished child (<3 mmol/l in severe malnutrition), give 5 ml/kg 10%
glucose rapidly IV.
If alert, treat hypoglycaemia with 10 ml/kg milk or 10% glucose by
mouth or NG tube.

Hydration & nutritional status
▶ Treat shock if present (

p 10).

▶ Assess and treat dehydration as outlined in Chapter 6.
▶ Assess and treat severe malnutrition as outlined in Chapter 17.

Further assessment and diagnosis

After triage assessment for emergency and priority signs, complete
clinical assessment. The most common acute problems in children are:
Lethargy, altered level of consciousness, or convulsions.
Cough, wheeze, or difficulty breathing.
Diarrhoea.
Fever.
Common problems that present less acutely include:
Chronic cough (≥30 days).
Fever lasting >7 days.
The major differential diagnoses for each of these clinical
presentations are summarized below.

Causes of lethargy, impaired consciousness, or
convulsions
1. Meningitis — Chapter 10.
2. Cerebral malaria — Chapter 2.
3. Febrile convulsions (see box).
4. Hypoglycaemia (see box).
5. Head injury — Chapter 10.
6. Poisoning/overdose — Chapter 21.
7. Sepsis (unlikely to cause convulsions unless meningitis).
8. Shock (unlikely to cause convulsions).
9. Acute glomerulonephritis with encephalopathy — Chapter 9.
10. Diabetic ketoacidosis — Chapter 12.

Causes of difficulty breathing ± cough
1. Pneumonia — Chapter 5.

2. Severe anaemia.
3. Malaria — Chapter 2.
4. Cardiac failure — Chapter 8.
5. Congenital heart disease (see box).
6. Inhaled foreign body — see earlier.
7. Tuberculosis — Chapter 4.
8. Pertussis — Chapter 5.

Causes of wheeze
1. Asthma — Chapter 5.
2. Bronchiolitis — Chapter 5.
3. Viral upper respiratory tract infection.
4. Pneumonia — Chapter 5.
5. Inhaled foreign body — see before.

Febrile convulsions
occur in children aged 6 months — 6 years.
typically a generalized tonic or tonic-clonic seizure lasting 1-2
minutes during a febrile illness.
generally benign.
may be a family history.
in a minority of children they recur in the same or a subsequent
illness.

A more serious cause
(e.g. meningitis, cerebral malaria, encephalitis, brain abscess)
suggested by:
prolonged seizures (>30 minutes).
multiple or focal seizures.
age <6 months.

When in doubt, perform full septic screen including LP.

Causes of diarrhoea — see Chapter 6
1. Infections — viral, bacterial, and parasitic.
2. Malabsorption.
3. Severe malnutrition.
4. Antibiotic related diarrhoea.
5. Intussusception (see box).

Causes of fever without localizing signs
In most children with fever, the cause is apparent clinically. Examine
the upper airways (viral URTI, otitis media, tonsillitis) and joints
(septic arthritis) as well as the major systems (pneumonia, meningitis).
Examine skin for infection or a rash (e.g. measles).
In the absence of localizing signs, a few common illnesses should be
considered:
1. Malaria — Chapter 2.
2. Sepsis — bacteraemia/septicaemia (see box).
3. Urinary tract infection.
4. Typhoid.

Causes of chronic cough
1. Tuberculosis — Chapter 4.
2. Asthma — Chapter 5.
3. Persistent infection e.g. Pertussis — Chapter 5.
4. Inhaled foreign body — Chapter 5.
5. Bronchiectasis — Chapter 5.
6. Lung abscess — Chapter 5.

7. Recurrent pneumonia or HIV-associated lung disease — Chapter 3.
8. Recurrent aspiration.

Differential diagnosis of fever lasting >7 days
Diagnosis is often difficult. Many children will have already been
empirically treated and diagnostic facilities may be limited. A detailed
clinical assessment is essential. Causes will vary in different regions. A
carefully considered trial of treatment for the most likely cause may
be necessary if a secure diagnosis cannot be made.

Consider
Partly treated, drug-resistant malaria.
Occult abscess (e.g. subphrenic, psoas, retroperitoneal, lung).
Typhoid and non-typhi Salmonella infection (see box).
Infective endocarditis — Chapter 8.
Rheumatic fever — Chapter 8.
Tuberculosis — Chapter 4.
Brucellosis (in endemic areas) — Chapter 18.
Visceral leishmaniasis (in endemic areas) — Chapter 18.

Intussusception
Invagination of one part of the intestine into the lumen of the
adjoining bowel.
Important cause of intestinal obstruction in children aged 2 mths
-5 yrs (peak incidence 4-10 mths).
Classically presents with recurrent, colicky, abdominal pain,
vomiting, and bloody ‘redcurrant jelly’ stool; may palpate a
sausage-shaped abdominal mass.
AXR may show a soft tissue mass displacing loops of bowel; barium
enema, a filling defect; and ultrasound scan, a ‘target lesion’.
Urgent intervention can prevent bowel ischaemia and

perforation: reduce intussusception with air/contrast enema; if
this fails, operate.
Treat shock, sepsis, or electrolyte derangement.

Bacteraemia & septicaemia
Common among children in the tropics.
Under-diagnosed where there are no facilities for blood culture.
Often there is a focus of infection (e.g. pneumonia, meningitis,
soft tissue infection), but may occur without a focus, or a focus
may develop later.
Typhoid and non-typhoid Salmonella infections are a cause of
sepsis without localizing signs; a similar syndrome may occur with
many other organisms, especially in children with severe
malnutrition or HIV.
All children with sepsis should be admitted and started on empiric
antibiotics (ideally after blood cultures), during investigations.
Choose broad-spectrum antibiotics if the cause is unknown.
Note that malaria is often accompanied by bacterial sepsis.

Non-typhi Salmonella (NTS) infection
NTS infections are a common cause of childhood bacteraemia.
Risk factors include malnutrition, malaria, HIV, and sickle cell
disease.
Children typically present with sub-acute or prolonged fever
without localizing signs, but focal signs and/or diarrhoea occur;
splenomegally is common.
Some 1st line antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) do not cover NTS.
Treatment is with chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, or ampicillin,
but multi-drug resistance is an increasing problem. Alternatives
are ciprofloxacin (resistance emerging) or ceftriaxone.

The sick young infant

Infants less <2 mth old are vulnerable, and their illnesses may rapidly
progress to death. All sick young infants should, therefore, be given
priority attention, even in the absence of emergency signs.

Assessment of the sick young infant
Symptoms and signs of illness in young infants are often subtle and
non-specific and more than one illness may co-exist.
Check for the danger signs (see box) — these indicate possible
septicaemia, pneumonia, or meningitis requiring immediate
treatment.
Check for focal signs of infection, including joint/ limb swelling,
reduced limb movement, or tenderness (osteomyelitis or septic
arthritis); peri-umbilical hyperaemia ± purulent discharge; purulent
ear discharge; skin infection. Suspect meningitis if child has
convulsions, is irritable with high pitched cry, or bulging/tense
anterior fontanelle. Note: neck stiffness is an unusual or late sign of
meningitis in young infants.
Check for feeding problems and weight: Check if sucking well and
adequate weight for age. Refusal of feeds or inability to suck may be
due to sepsis, cardiac or respiratory problems, or oral thrush. In an
infant who feeds well but has low weight for age, look for underlying
problems such as metabolic disorders or congenital heart disease.
Check for signs of dehydration (
p 249). Inadequate intake,
excessive fluid loss from diarrhoea, vomiting or tachypnoea may
result in dehydration. Diarrhoea is uncommon in breastfed infants of
this age group except as a sign of sepsis.
Check immunization status: ensure that child is up to date with
immunization according to the national schedule.
Check for congenital malformations.

Danger signs in young infants
Reduced activity or lethargy.
Poor feeding.

Vomiting.
Convulsions — usually subtle or focal.
Bloody diarrhoea.
Fever (axillary temp >37.5°C, or rectal >38°C) —
less common in this age group but may indicate
serious bacterial infection.
Hypothermia (axillary <35.5°C or rectal <36°C).
Pallor, jaundice, or cyanosis.
Tachypnoea (respiratory rate ≥60 breaths/minute).
Severe chest wall indrawing (minimal intercostal
indrawing may be normal in young infants in
absence of other respiratory signs).
Nasal flaring and grunting.
Apnoeic episodes or irregular respiration.
Bulging/tense fontanelle when not crying.

Emergency treatment of the sick young
infant

P.20

Establish regular respiration and heart rate and reverse cyanosis.
Resuscitation is usually successful if promptly performed:

Airway:
ensure patent airway by careful suctioning and correct positioning of
the neck: place a towel ~2.5 cm thick under the shoulders to allow the
neck to drop to a neutral position or just minimal extension with chin
lift; do not hyperextend the neck (Fig. 1.6).

Fig. 1.6 Correct position of the neck for ventilation. (Reproduced
with permission of the WHO.)

Breathing:
look, feel, and listen for 10 seconds. If breathing is irregular, shallow,
or absent, commence bag and mask ventilation with oxygen, ensuring
that the mask covers nose and mouth. Check pulse every 2 minutes.
Use room air if oxygen is not available. If the child is breathing but
cyanosed, give oxygen.
Unlike in adults, most arrests in young infants are 1° respiratory
arrests ± 2° cardiac arrest. As a result, adequate ventilation alone is
sufficient to maintain cardiac output in most cases.

Circulation:
check for brachial pulse for no longer than 10 seconds. If pulse rate
<60/minute, absent, or not sure, commence chest compressions and
combine with ventilation in cycles of 15 compressions to 2 breaths
(30:2 if there is no assistance). Use two finger tips over lower third of
sternum or both thumbs with hand encircling chest. Aim to achieve 100

compressions per minute.

Drugs:
if there is no response after 2 minutes, administer intravenous or
intraosseous adrenaline 0.1 ml/kg of 1:10,000 solution (10 µ/kg) and
continue chest compressions and ventilation. This may be repeated
after 3-5 minutes if there is no response.

General measures in the management of sick
young infants
Young infants with signs of serious illness (
p 18) require admission
to prevent complications and rapid deterioration. Treatment, including
antibiotics (see box), will be directed at the specific clinical syndrome.
In addition, all young infants require ongoing supportive care, which is
crucial to their survival even after recovery from the acute illness.

Feeding:
ensure continued regular feeding. Express breastmilk and give by NG
tube if infant is unable to suck, or by cup and spoon as soon as infant is
able to take oral feeds. Oral intake should be stopped if there is
abdominal distention, severe vomiting, or respiratory distress. Treat
hypoglycaemia with IV 10% dextrose 5 ml/kg or 10 ml/kg via
nasogastric tube and continue regular feeds or IV fluids.

Fluid therapy:
assess hydration status and give ORS or IV fluids according to WHO
guidelines (Chapter 6).

Temperature control:
keep infant dry and well dressed/wrapped including bonnet and
booties. Maintain environmental temperature of at least 25°C. Avoid
excessive exposure during examination and procedures as this may lead
to chilling. Use incubators when available to allow easy observation

with minimal handling of baby in addition to thermal control. Direct
skin to skin care (Kangaroo mother care (KMC) see box) may be used
when the infant is stable. If there is fever, reduce dressing and expose
but do not give antipyretics.

Oxygen therapy
Indications for oxygen therapy include: central cyanosis, grunting,
severe lower chest wall indrawing, and head nodding.

Treatment of convulsions
Neonates (<2 weeks old): IM phenobarbital 15 mg/kg stat; if
convulsions persist, give further doses of 10 mg/kg to a maximum of 40
mg/kg and watch for apnoea; if maintenance is required, give 2.5-5.0
mg/kg/day PO. Infants 2 weeks-2 months old: rectal diazepam 0.1
mg/kg, repeated twice at 10 min intervals if convulsions persist. Rectal
paraldehyde 0.3-0.4 ml/kg may be given instead of a 3rd dose of
diazepam.

Monitoring
It is essential to observe infant at least every 6 h for improvement or
deterioration.

Outpatient treatment
Infants with non-bloody diarrhoea and some or no signs of dehydration
(
p 249), or poor weight gain due to feeding mismanagement may be
treated as outpatients. However, the mother should be informed of
danger signs that would prompt urgent review. Local bacterial
infections without constitutional symptoms are common and may be
treated on an outpatient basis, with follow-up at short intervals
because of the risk of rapid progression to septicaemia. They include:
omphalitis (without hyperaemia of surrounding skin), skin sepsis (if
only a few skin pustules), paronychia, and mild conjunctivitis.

Antibiotic therapy of infections in young infants

Choice of antibiotics should be based on local data of prevailing
organisms and antibiotic sensitivities.

Sepsis or pneumonia
Give ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV/IM tds* (or benzyl penicillin 50,000 U/kg
qds*) plus gentamicin 7.5 mg/kg* IV/IM od. Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg
IV/IM qds* or ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg IV/IM od*† are alternatives. If S.
aureus infection suspected (e.g. nosocomial sepsis, soft tissue
infection), give cloxacillin 50 mg/kg IV qds* or cefuroxime 25 mg/kg
tds, plus gentamicin. Treat until child has remained well for four
days.

Meningitis
Give ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV/IM tds*, plus either gentamicin 7.5
mg/kg* or chloramphenicol 25 mg/kg qds (avoid chloramphenicol in
premature neonates). Treat for a minimum of 14 days, or 21 days if
gram-negative bacterial meningitis proven or suspected.
Alternatives are cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV/IM qds* or ceftriaxone 100
mg/kg/ IV/IM od.*†

Focal bacterial infections
Cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin, or a cephalosporin.

Conjunctivitis
Teach the mother to clean the eyes with saline or clean water ±
apply topical antibiotic — review the child after 2 days. Ophthalmia
neonatorum (
p 532, 609) is a severe, suppurative conjunctivitis,
often with associated blepharitis, that occurs in neonates,
particularly in the 1st week of life, and may cause permanent
blindness if not treated. It is caused by N. gonorrhoea or C.
trachomatis perinatally; other organisms include S. aureus. Gram
stain of the discharge may demonstrate gram positive diplococci (N.
gonorrhoea) — if so, give ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IM as a single dose,
treat the parents presumptively for N. gonorrhoea (
p 609).

Kangaroo mother care (KMC)

This is direct skin to skin care of the infant. The baby is placed
naked (except for the nappy) directly on mother's bare chest, and
strapped in place to get warmth while the mother goes about her
regular activity. KMC is an alternative to an incubator and may
reduce hospital stay, help early establishment of breastfeeding, and
promote mother/child bonding. Close family members, including the
father, can also provide KMC.

Low birth weight (LBW) & prematurity
LBW infants (birth weight <2500 g) may result from prematurity or
intrauterine growth retardation. Infants 1750-2250 g and born after 34
weeks' gestation may be nursed with their mothers, with close
supervision, in the nursery. Infants >2250 g may be sent home if there
are no danger signs. Essential aspects of LBW care include:

Prevention of infection:
wash hands with soap and water each time the infant is to be handled.

Temperature control:
(see above): maintain the infant's axillary temperature above 36.5°C.

Feeding:
LBW babies are prone to hypoglycaemia and may not suck adequately.
They should be breastfed within 1 hour of birth and may require
additional expressed breast milk by cup and spoon. Mothers should be
shown proper latching-on techniques.

Be alert for danger signs:
promptly refer to the neonatal unit if present.

Monitor weight gain

Neonatal jaundice
Jaundice occurs in >50% neonates and is more common in LBW infants.
Most jaundice is physiological. Jaundice may also be a sign of serious
disease (e.g. infection; see box), especially if it occurs on day 1, is
associated with fever, is deep (involves palms and soles), or lasts >14
days (>21 days if premature).
Severe jaundice may cause kernicterus (neurotoxicity). In its mild
form, there is lethargy and reduced feeding. Severe kernicterus causes
irritability, hypertonia, ± opisthotonos, and long-term neurological
sequelae.

Investigations:
total serum bilirubin and conjugated/unconjugated bilirubin, FBC,
maternal and infant blood group; Coombs test, G6PD screen, thyroid
function, syphilis serology; abdominal USS.

Management of jaundice:
Ensure adequate hydration.
Exclude serious causes (see box).
Treat severe jaundice to prevent kernicterus — see box.
Phototherapy reduces jaundice by using ultraviolet light to cause
photodegradation of bilirubin in the skin; protect infant's eyes and
beware dehydration, hypothermia, or hyperthermia; other
complications include diarrhoea and rash.
Exchange blood transfusion may be required for severe jaundice:
twice the infant's blood volume (i.e. 2 x 80 ml/kg) is exchanged for
fresh donor blood in 10-20 ml aliquots via an umbilical vein catheter;
there is a low but definite risk attached to the procedure.

Problems associated with low birth weight
Poor thermal regulation.
Feeding problems (inadequate intake, gastro-oesophageal reflux).

Necrotizing enterocolitis.
Neonatal jaundice.
Metabolic problems (hypoglycaemia, acidosis, hypocalcaemia,
fluid and electrolyte imbalance).
Apnoea.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Patent ductus arteriosus.
Increased predisposition to infections.

Common causes of neonatal jaundice
Jaundice starting within 24 h of birth:
Haemolysis (e.g. Rhesus or ABO incompatibility; G6PD or pyruvate
kinase deficiency; congenital spherocytosis).
Infection (TORCH* organisms).
Jaundice starting from day 2 to week 2 after birth:
Physiological jaundice.
Breast milk jaundice.
Severe bruising.
Infection.
Haemolysis.
Jaundice persisting for >2 weeks after birth:
Biliary atresia.
Neonatal hepatitis.
Haemolysis.
Congenital hypothyroidism.
Infection.
May also be persistence of breast milk or physiological jaundice.

Hypothermia
Hypothermia (body temp <36°C) is a common problem of LBW infants,
resulting from low environmental temperature or sepsis. It causes
increased O2 consumption and energy expenditure and reduced O2
delivery to tissues.

Complications:
include: hypoxia, acidosis, and hypoglycaemia; poor weight gain;
increased capillary permeability; and respiratory distress.

Preterm or risk

Treatment:
re-warm infant using warm clothing, incubator preheated to 35-36°C,
heated mattress, or skin to skin care. Exclude sepsis.

Prevention:
nurse infants in warm environments. Avoid wet clothes. Do not place
infant on cold surfaces e.g. X-ray plates and weighing scales.

Apnoea
Apnoeic episodes are common in LBW infants and may be accompanied
by bradycardia if prolonged. Gentle physical stimulation often
stimulates breathing, but respiratory stimulants (caffeine or
theophylline) and occasionally ventilatory support, may be required.
Seek underlying causes: infection, hypoxia, metabolic derangement,
anaemia, or subtle seizures.

Perinatal asphyxia
In perinatal asphyxia there is hypoxia, acidosis, and CO2 accumulation
around time of delivery, which may cause hypoxic-ischaemic
encephalopathy. It accounts for much neonatal mortality and longterm morbidity, especially in low-resource settings. Largely
preventable with improved obstetric care, prompt resuscitation, and
supportive care of the neonate.

Assessment
Risk factors for the development of asphyxia are listed in the box.
Prenatal and intrapartum parameters can indicate asphyxia and the
following are indicators of asphyxia at birth:
Apgar scores <3 at 1 minute, <7 at 5 minutes.
Resuscitation >10 min before spontaneous respiration established.
Cord blood pH <7 or base excess >12 mmol/l.

Prevention
Monitoring the mother's condition in pregnancy and labour helps to
predict infants at risk of asphyxia. However, some babies who present
with birth asphyxia have not been exposed to any of the known risk
factors. Everyone involved in the delivery of babies should be skilled in
newborn resuscitation in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality
associated with asphyxia.

Risk factors for perinatal asphyxia:
Maternal medical or obstetric factors: hyper- or hypotension,
heart failure, diabetes, severe anaemia, haemoglobinopathies,
infections, respiratory illness (e.g. pneumonia, asthma), smoking,
alcoholism, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, primigravidity or
grandmultiparity, induction of labour, sedation, analgesia,
prolonged rupture of membranes, prolonged labour.
Foetal factors: multiple gestation, prematurity or post term,
intra-uterine growth retardation or large for gestational age,
intrauterine infections, abnormal presentation, congenital
abnormalities.
Placental factors: abruptio placenta, placenta praevia, placental
insufficiency, cord compression.

Complications of asphyxia and their
management
Asphyxia may result in multi-organ dysfunction:
Respiratory system: persistent pulmonary
hypertension and respiratory distress syndrome.
Ensure good oxygenation.
Cardiovascular system: myocardial damage → poor
cardiac output. Monitor capillary refill and BP. Avoid
fluid overload and give inotropes if necessary.
Gastrointestinal system: risk of necrotizing

enterocolitis. Avoid enteral feeding in first 24-48 h
(beware hypoglycaemia!). With introduction of
feeds, avoid hyperosmolar feeds and stasis.
Metabolic: hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia may
worsen hypoxic damage to the brain.
Hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia or
acidosis may result; monitor blood glucose and
electrolytes.
Renal function: increased risk of urinary retention
and renal failure. Monitor fluid intake, urine output,
and urine specific gravity. Catheterize to
differentiate between failure to produce or void
urine.
Haematologic: bone marrow suppression,
neutrophil dysfunction, and coagulopathies. Monitor
FBC and for evidence of bleeding.
Brain: encephalopathy results from hypoxia,
cerebral oedema, ↑ICP. Look for ↓reflexes,
abnormal muscle tone, seizures, varying degrees of
altered consciousness, and long-term neurological
sequelae.
Other general measures. Ensure thermoneutral
environment, adequate calories, and hydration,
and treat neonatal jaundice.

Neonatal tetanus

P.28

This frequently fatal but preventable condition remains common in
some developing countries. Clostridium tetani usually gains access to
the infant through the umbilical stump (due to poor hygiene or a
tradition of applying dung to the stump) or through unsterile
circumcision. In older children, entry may be due to ear piercing,

scarifications, and other harmful traditional practices, or trauma. The
pathogenesis of tetanus is described in Chapter 10.

Clinical features:
neonatal tetanus usually presents between 2 and 14 days of age, but
may occur later. Clinical features include:
Refusal of feeds.
Inability to open mouth.
Excessive crying.
Muscle rigidity and spasms — provoked and spontaneous.
Fever.
Intact consciousness.

Diagnosis:
is mainly clinical.

Treatment
1. Muscle relaxants
Oral diazepam 5 mg/kg/day in divided doses via nasogastric tube.
For difficult to controlled spasms:
IV diazepam 0.1-0.3 mg/kg every 1-4 hrs titrated to spasm
frequency.
IV midazolam 0.06 mg/kg/h is a suitable but expensive
alternative.
IV magnesium sulphate may also be useful.
2. IM tetanus immune globulin 500 units or equine anti-tetanus serum
10,000 units single dose
3. Tetanus toxoid (in a different site) if >6 weeks old

4. Antibiotics
Metronidazole, procaine penicillin, or erythromycin.
Add broad-spectrum antibiotics if associated sepsis suspected.
5. Supportive care
Nutritional support.
Nurse in quiet, dark environment to prevent provoked spasms (but
ensure adequate clinical supervision).
Ensure clear airway.
Ventilatory support if needed.

Poor prognostic factors
Incubation period <7 days.
Period of onset <24 h.
Associated pneumonia.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of neonatal tetanus
Maternal education.
Maternal tetanus toxoid immunization.
Hygienic delivery and cord care practices.
Avoidance of harmful traditional practices.

Malaria

Introduction
Malaria, a protozoan infection transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes,
is the most important parasitic disease of humans. As many as 3 billion
people in endemic areas are at risk of malaria and ~500 million clinical
cases occur annually. Between 1 and 3 million die annually, largely
African infants and young children. There are four human malaria
parasite species (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P.
malariae), though occasionally other primate malaria species cause
humans infections (e.g. P. knowlesi and P. simium). The manifestations
of malaria vary greatly, not only from geographical region to region,
village to village, but also from person to person. These differences
are due to many factors and include mosquito biting and breeding
habits, the infecting parasite species (P. falciparum resulting in the
most severe forms of disease), the state of both genetic and acquired
resistance of the host, and compliance with drug treatment.

Life cycle and transmission
The life cycle of the malarial parasite alternates between the sexual
cycle in the invertebrate host (the female Anopheles mosquito) and
the asexual cycle in the vertebrate host (in this case, human).
Transmission occurs when the mosquito, requiring blood for the

development of her eggs, bites the human host and injects motile
sporozoites (see opposite) into the bloodstream which then invade
hepatocytes, where they develop into liver schizonts. When each
schizont ruptures, thousands of merozoites are released that invade
red blood cells and initiate that part of the cycle responsible for all
the clinical manifestations of the disease. Either immediately after
release from the liver or (in the case of P. falciparum) after several
asexual cycles, some parasites develop into longer-lived,
morphologically distinct sexual forms (gametocytes). Male and female
gametocytes ingested by mosquitoes taking a blood meal combine to
form a zygote, which matures into an ookinete that encysts in the gut
wall. There an oocyst develops, expanding by asexual division until it
bursts releasing numerous sporozoites that migrate to the salivary
glands to await inoculation into a human host when the mosquito next
feeds.

Incubation periods
P. falciparum usually 7-14 days but may be longer (up to 6 weeks) in
those with partial immunity or those on inadequate prophylaxis. P.
vivax 12-17 days and P. ovale 15-18 days but may relapse many months
or even years later as a result of the reactivation of a dormant form in
the liver called the hypnozoite; P. malariae, which has no hypnozoite
form, has an average incubation period of between 18 and 40 days.

Fig. 2.1 The malaria life cycle.

Epidemiology
Malarial transmission depends upon a number of factors including:
a. mosquito longevity (lifespan).
b. the ambient temperature (shortens the cycle in the mosquito).
c. population density of both mosquito and humans.

d. the mosquito's human-biting habit.
e. the host immune response.
f. whether the drugs used in treatment have any activity against
gametocytes.
In endemic areas, transmission may be measured using the parasite
rate (% of the population who are positive for malarial parasites on
blood film) or the spleen rate (% of population with splenomegaly),
although the latter is less reliable since an enlarged spleen may be a
result of other diseases. Neither method, however, reflects the clinical
impact of mortality or morbidity of the disease on a given population.
Two distinct patterns of malarial transmission emerge which represent
extremes:
Stable malaria, where there is intense all year round transmission.
The disease predominantly affects young children and pregnant
women. Adults might be positive on blood film but are rarely ill with
malaria.
Unstable malaria, which affects all ages and occurs in areas of
seasonal or low transmission.
Malaria control in stable areas is problematic, since interventions that
↓ transmission, but do not eradicate the disease, may impair the
development of naturally acquired immunity in the population,
resulting in a pattern of unstable disease.

Protection against malaria
Many innate factors of resistance against infection were first identified
in falciparum malaria. Acquired resistance to malaria is slow to
develop and the immune mechanisms involved are still unclear.

Innate immunity:
Falciparum malaria remains the best example of a selective agent that
results in genetic polymorphisms in the host that might provide partial
protection against severe disease. Certain genetic variants of the red
cell, notably sickle cell trait, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD)-deficiency, thalassaemia trait, and ovalocytosis, may partially

protect against severe disease. The lack of Duffy antigen (the receptor
for merozoites of P. vivax) on red cells in most West Africans may
account for their protection against this infection.

Acquired immunity:
is believed to require repeated exposure to malarial infection, possibly
with differing genetic variants of the parasite. In areas of stable
transmission, neonates are usually protected by maternal antibodies
for the first 6 months or so of life, followed by a period of increased
susceptibility during which it is thought that immunity to severe
disease is slowly acquired (‘antidisease immunity’). Depending upon
the level of transmission, antiparasite immunity appears later, at 710
yrs of age, when the parasite rate may be as high as 50%. Adults tend
to get less severe bouts of disease but when they do, parasite densities
are generally lower than in children. Without reinfection, immunity
wanes after about 5 yrs. Pregnancy, severe illness, and surgery may
also lead to ↓ immunity.

HIV infection:
It is becoming increasingly apparent that a complex interaction exists
between HIV infection and malaria. Malaria increases viral loads in
HIV-positive individuals, and there is evidence that HIV increases both
the incidence of malaria (in areas of stable transmission) and the
occurrence of severe malaria complications (in areas of unstable
transmission). In pregnancy, HIV predisposes the mother to malaria
infection and the newborn to congenital malaria. HIV also exacerbates
the birthweight reduction associated with malaria in pregnancy.

Complications of malaria
Falciparum malaria
Falciparum malaria may progress to severe disease
and death (malignant tertian malaria). In endemic
areas where parasites persist after treatment or
patients are soon reinfected, anaemia is common

and further attacks, due to recrudescence of blood
forms, may occur.
In some countries, 30% of patients with falciparum
malaria develop symptomatic P. vivax infection
within 2 months without re-exposure to parasites,
implying an initial mixed infection.
The benign malarias
P. vivax: a rare complication of P. vivax infection is
splenic rupture (mortality 80%). It results from
acute enlargement with or without trauma and
presents with sudden and persistent abdominal
pain, guarding, fever, shock, and a lowered
haemocrit.
Relapses: P. vivax and P. ovale may relapse from
30 days to 5 yrs after initial infection despite
treatment which eliminates all blood forms. This is
due to latent liver hypnozoites undergoing
schizogony and re-entering the blood stream — a
true relapse (as opposed to recrudescence).
P. malariae: persistent parasites may cause
recurrent fevers when the infection recrudesces
even decades following 1° infection. The fevers
decrease in frequency and severity over time.
Anaemia and splenomegaly may occur.

Clinical features
P. falciparum infection, if treated promptly and appropriately,
generally follows a relatively mild course. However, without effective
therapy it can become life-threatening, especially in young children
and non-immune adults. By contrast, P. ovale, P. malaria, and P. vivax
infection rarely result in severe disease or death except rarely with

splenic rupture. Chronic infection or infection of pregnant women with
these ‘benign’ species may lead to marked morbidity e.g. anaemia and
reduced birth weight.
Two important features distinguish falciparum infection from benign
malarias and account for the differences in severity: only falciparum
malaria results in high parasite densities in the blood and only
falciparum demonstrates ‘sequestration’ in the microvasculature of
red cells containing mature parasites. Sequestration results mainly
from cytoadherence of parasitized red cells to endothelial cells in the
post capillary venules of critical organs including the brain, although
other factors such as decreased deformability of both parasitized and
unparasitized red cells, autoagglutination of parasitized cells, and
adherence of unparasitized to parasitized red cells (rosetting) may
play a role.

Acute malaria
The clinical presentation of acute malaria in adults with rigors is well
known. There is usually a history of travel to or residence in an
endemic area. Even the best compliance with the most effective
antimalarial chemoprophylaxis cannot exclude malaria. There may be
a prodromal period of tiredness and aching. The features of a classical
paroxysm are:
An abrupt onset of an initial ‘cold stage’ associated with a dramatic
rigor (paroxysm) in which the patient visibly shakes.
An ensuing ‘hot stage’ during which the patient may have a
temperature >40°C, be restless and excitable, and vomit or
convulse.
Finally, the sweating stage, during which the patient's temperature
returns to normal (defervesces) and sleep may ensue.
Such a paroxysm can last 6-10 h; a prolonged asymptomatic period may
follow lasting 38-42 h in the case of vivax and ovale malaria (‘tertian’
fever) and 62-66 h in P. malariae infections (‘quartan’ fever).
In falciparum malaria, the periodicity of fever is be less predictable
and the fever may be continuous. There may be an accompanying

headache, cough, myalgia (flu-like symptoms), diarrhoea, and mild
jaundice.
Malaria is rarely, if ever, the cause of lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, or
a rash, and alternative diagnoses need to be considered for these
symptoms. In children, malaria may be non-specific and misleading
with fever, early cough, D&V, anaemia, and hypoglycaemia. Jaundice,
pulmonary oedema, and renal failure are much rarer in children than
adults, although progression to other severe complications is usually
faster (1-2 days) in children.

Chronic malaria
The persistence of low-level parasitaemia in the blood may lead to
‘chronic’ malaria. Symptoms include recurrent acute attacks of
malaria, anaemia, hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhoea, weight loss, and
increased incidence of other infections. Chronic malaria may
resolve, with the onset of partial immunity, or progress, with 2°
complications:

Burkitt's lymphoma
is a childhood tumour common in areas of high falciparum malaria
transmission. It is thought to be due to impaired T-cell immunity
associated with repeated malaria infections and is strongly
associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly
(formerly called tropical splenomegaly syndrome) may develop with
recurrent infections. It is characterized by massive splenomegaly,
profound anaemia, 2° bacterial infections, fever, and jaundice.
There is hypersplenism with pancytopenia,
hypergammaglobulinaemia, and a lymphocytic infiltrate in the liver.
There is a marked elevation of serum IgM. Although malarial
parasites are seldom found in the blood, the condition responds to
prolonged courses of antimalarial prophylaxis.

Quartan malarial nephropathy.
P. malariae infection appears to be a cause of nephrotic syndrome,
particularly in West and East Africa. Malarial antigens are found in
the renal glomerular basement membrane. The condition

unfortunately does not respond to antimalarial treatment,
glucocorticoids, or cytotoxic drugs.

Pregnancy
Pregnancy increases the risk of contracting falciparum malaria in all
levels of endemicity.
In areas of high, stable transmission, despite higher parasite
burdens, most infections are asymptomatic, but result in a reduction
in birth weight with a consequent increase in infant morbidity and
mortality. The effect is greater in primagravidae and
(independently) in younger women.
In areas of unstable transmission, pregnancy causes more severe
disease, particularly anaemia, hypoglycaemia, and acute pulmonary
oedema. Foetal distress, premature labour, and stillbirth occur and
low birth weight is common. In severe malaria, foetal death is the
usual outcome.
P. vivax malaria in pregnancy is also associated with a reduction in
birth weight, though to a lesser extent than P. falciparum. The effect
is greater in multigravidae than primagravidae.
Congenital malaria has a very variable incidence. In some high
transmission areas, parasitaemia in the newborn is >50%, but
symptomatic disease rare.

Severe malaria
(see WHO criteria opposite)
Severe malaria often manifests as a serious multisystem disease. The
onset of severe disease can be rapid, with death (particularly in
children) occurring in a matter of hours. In travellers from endemic
regions, it is most frequently observed when the diagnosis of malaria is
made late and treatment delayed.

Cerebral malaria (CM):

is the most important complication of falciparum malaria and has a
~20% treated mortality. It most often occurs in non-immune adults and
in children. CM is ‘unrousable coma in the presence of peripheral
parasitaemia where other causes of encephalopathy have been
excluded'. However, any alteration in consciousness in the context of
falciparum malaria should be taken seriously. Neck rigidity and
photophobia are not usually seen and Kernig's sign is -ve. There may be
one or more of: diffuse cerebral dysfunction with coma, generalized
convulsions (~50%), focal neurological signs, and brainstem signs such
as abnormal doll's eye or oculovestibular reflexes. Retinal
haemorrhages are seen in ~15% of cases, increasing to ~40% if papillary
dilatation and indirect ophthalmoscopy are used. Neurological
sequelae are found in ~5% of survivors (10% in children) and include
hemiparesis, cerebellar ataxia, cortical blindness, hypotonia, and
mental retardation. In children, CM carries a 10-40% mortality, most
deaths occurring within the first 24 h.
Reduced GCS may follow a febrile convulsion in a child or be caused by
hypoglycaemia, which must be excluded. Malarial convulsions can
occur at any temperature and post-ictal coma may last several hours.
In deep coma, abnormalities of posture and muscle tone are frequently
seen. For young children use the Blantyre Coma Scale (shown opposite)
to grade the coma.

Respiratory distress (RD):
is manifest by rapid, laboured breathing, sometimes with abnormal
rhythms of respiration. In children, there may be intercostal recession,
use of the accessory muscles of respiration and nasal flaring, which is
sometimes difficult to differentiate from an acute respiratory
infection. RD in patients with malaria may be the result of a number of
pathologies:
In most cases, particularly in children, RD represents respiratory
compensation for a profound metabolic acidosis. Severe metabolic
acidosis (BE <-12) is associated with an 8-fold ↑ risk of death in
children.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by direct alveolar

capillary damage by parasites and neutrophils worsened by
hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic fluid overload.
A lung infection because of the immunosuppression caused by
malaria.
Air hunger as a result of severe anaemia.
Each requires different treatment.

Anaemia:
all patients with malaria sustain some fall in Hb level. The anaemia is
normocytic. Severe anaemia with a haematocrit <15% (or Hb <5 g/dl)
in the presence of parasitaemia >10,000/ul (about 0.2% of cells
infected) is a common presentation in African children. Pallor,
breathlessness, gallop rhythm, RD, pulmonary oedema, and
neurological signs are common features of severe anaemia. Anaemia is
exacerbated by 2° bacterial infections, haemorrhage, and pregnancy.
Hyperparasitaemia and/or G6PD deficiency can result in massive
intravascular haemolysis. In children, repeated episodes of otherwise
uncomplicated malaria may lead to chronic normochromic anaemia

with dyserythropoeitic changes in the bone marrow.

Jaundice:
is common in adult patients and results from a number of mechanisms
including haemolysis, hepatocellular damage, and cholestasis. Both
unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin may be >50 µmol/l (3.0 mg/dl).
Clinical signs of liver failure are unusual unless there is concomitant
viral hepatitis.

Renal impairment:
may be pre-renal or renal in origin, usually occurs in adults, and is
characterized by a ↑ serum Cr (>265 µmol/l or 3 mg/dl) and ↑ urea,
with oliguria (<400 ml urine/24 h in an adult) or anuria due to acute
tubular necrosis. Renal impairment may occur at the time of maximal
parasitaemia or even when the parasites have been cleared. In some
cases, there is polyuria. Renal failure in malaria has a poor prognosis
(~45% die).

Blackwater fever:
is massive haemoglobinuria (the urine becomes very dark) in the
context of malaria. The cause is incompletely characterized but in
some cases it follows treatment with quinine or treatment or
prophylaxis with oxidant drugs such as primaquine. It is more common
in patients with G6PD deficiency or other red cell enzyme deficiencies
(e.g. pyruvate kinase). In colonial times, blackwater fever was more
common and the mortality much higher.

Hypoglycaemia:
(whole blood glucose <2.2 mmol/l, 40 mg/dl) may be due to impaired
liver function or quinine/quinidine-induced hyperinsulinaemia
(pregnant women are particularly prone). It presents with anxiety,
sweating, breathlessness, dilated pupils, oliguria, hypothermia,
tachycardia, and light-headedness, eventually leading to decreased
consciousness, convulsions, and coma. However, it can easily be missed
in patients with disturbed conscious level. In a fasting adult, hepatic

glycogen stores last ~2 days; in a child ~12 h. Hence, hypoglycaemia is
common in 1-3 yr olds (especially those with CM, hyperparasitaemia,
or convulsions). Hypoglycaemia indicates a poor prognosis and is a risk
factor for neurological sequelae. It is not associated with signs of
malnutrition.

Indicators of a poor prognosis
Clinical
Marked agitation.
Hyperventilation (respiratory distress).
Hypothermia (<36.5°C).
Deep coma.
Repeated convulsions.
Bleeding.
Anuria.
Haemodynamic shock.

Laboratory
Blood film showing hyperparasitemia >100,000/µl (about 2% of
cells infected).
Blood film showing >20% of parasites to be ‘late stages’ (pigmentcontaining trophozoites and schizonts).
Blood film showing >5% of neutrophils with visible pigment.
Hypoglycaemia (<2.2 mmol/l).
Hyperlactataemia (>5 mmol/l).
Acidosis (arterial pH <7.3, serum HCO3 <15 mmol/l).
Elevated serum creatinine (>265 µmol/l).
Elevated total bilirubin >50 µmol/l.
Leucocytosis (>12,000/µl).
Severe anaemia (PCV <15%).
Coagulopathy.
Decreased platelet count (<50,000/µl).

Prolonged prothrombin time.
Decreased fibrinogen (<200 mg/dl).

Lactic acidosis:
pH <7.3 or ↑ plasma and CSF lactate levels (plasma >5 mmol/l) and a
low plasma HCO3- (<15 mmol/l) carry a poor prognosis in both adults
and children. Acidosis is a major contributor to RD, especially in
children.

Fluid and electrolyte disturbances:
hypovolaemia and dehydration are thought to be common, although
recently this has become controversial. Low Na+, Cl-, PO4-, Ca2+, Mg2+
and endocrine dysfunction also occur, but seldom have major clinical
implications except in the severely ill.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome:
carries a 50% mortality and may occur at a time when the patient is
otherwise improving. Excessive fluid replacement exacerbates this
complication and is suggested by ↑ respiratory rate (exclude aspiration
or acidosis). Predisposing causes include hyperparasitaemia, renal
failure, and pregnancy (may occur suddenly after delivery). Hypoxia
may cause convulsions and death within a few hours.

Shock (algid malaria):
cold, clammy cyanotic skin; weak rapid pulses; prolonged capillary
refill time in children (>3 s); supine systolic BP <70 mmHg (<50 mmHg in
children) suggests circulatory collapse. Shock in malaria is commonly
associated with 2° bacterial infection, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary
oedema, dehydration, or a gastrointestinal bleed.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):
is due to pathological activation of the coagulation cascade. DIC may

manifest with bleeding gums, epistaxis, petechiae, haematemesis,
and/or melaena with significant blood loss. DIC occurs in <10% of
patients but is more common in non-immune people (especially
travellers). Blood film shows thrombocytopenia and schistocytes
(damaged red cells). There is ↑ prothrombin time (PT) and ↓ plasma
fibrinogen.

Hyperparasitaemia:
a parasite density >100,000 parasites/µl (about 2% of cells infected) is
associated with ↑ mortality, although non-immune patients may die
with much lower counts and in highly endemic areas individuals may
tolerate greater densities without accompanying clinical features.
Parasitaemias of >500,000 parasites/µl is associated with a 50% case
fatality.

Gastrointestinal symptoms:
are common in children. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and
diarrhoea without blood or pus are frequently seen. Persistent
vomiting requires urgent parenteral drug administration.

Secondary infection:
with septicaemia, pneumonia (e.g. following aspiration), urinary tract
infection (following catheterization) and postpartum sepsis are
common. Gram negative septicaemia may occur without any focus of
infection.

Differential diagnosis
Differential diagnosis of malaria
Malaria is a great mimic and must enter the differential diagnosis of
several clinical presentations.
The presentation of fever needs to be differentiated from other
endemic diseases such as typhoid and rickettsial infections, viral
illnesses such as dengue fever and influenza, brucellosis, and

respiratory and urinary tract infections. Less common causes of
tropical fevers include leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and
relapsing fevers.
The coma of CM needs to be differentiated from meningitis
(including tuberculous meningitis), encephalitis, enteric fevers,
trypanosomiasis, brain abscess, and other causes of coma.
The anaemia of malaria can be confused with other common
causes of haemolytic anaemia in the tropics such as that due to
the haemoglobinopathies. The anaemia of malaria must be
differentiated from that of iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency.
The renal failure of malaria must be distinguished from massive
intravascular haemolysis, sickle cell disease, leptospirosis, snake
envenoming, use of traditional herbal medicines, and chronic
renal disease resulting from glomerulonephritis and hypertension.
The jaundice and hepatomegaly of malaria must be distinguished
from that of viral hepatitis (A, B, and E, cytomegalovirus and
Epstein-Barr virus infections), leptospirosis, yellow fever, biliary
disease, and drug-induced disease including alcohol.
Clinical diagnosis on its own is notoriously inaccurate in the
diagnosis of malaria and a blood film is desirable. However, in areas
of stable transmission with high population parasite rates this can
be very non-specific. If in doubt, presumptive antibiotic treatment
should be given alongside antimalarial drugs.

Laboratory diagnosis
Blood films
The diagnosis of malaria requires identification of parasites in smears
of blood. See blood film diagrams and thick/thin film methodology.
Maintain a high index of suspicion and carry out at ≥3 blood films.
Infection may exceptionally occur via transfusion, needlestick injury,
intravenous drug abuse, and during brief airport stopovers in endemic
areas or when infected mosquitoes ‘alight’ from airplane flights from
endemic areas and bite individuals (‘airport’ malaria). In falciparum

malaria, the presence of schizonts in peripheral blood samples may
indicate severe infection as these forms would normally sequester.

Pitfalls of blood films
A single negative film does not exclude malaria. Repeat on 3
occasions at intervals. Blood films do not have to be taken at times
of fever spikes. The patient may have been partially treated,
suppressing patent infection. Malaria prophylaxis should be stopped
whilst investigating for active infection.
In endemic areas, a positive film does not prove that malaria is
responsible for the current symptoms.
Correlation between parasite density and disease severity may be
poor — patients with a low parasitaemia may be very ill, whilst
semi-immunes may harbour high parasitaemias with relatively few
symptoms.
Platelets, cell fragments, and impurities in the stain can be mistaken
for malarial parasites.

Non-blood film malaria diagnostic tests
Currently available tests include dipstick antigen capture tests (e.g.
Paracheck, ParaSight F, Malaria PF Test, OptiMAL test), phagocyte
malarial pigment, quantitative buffy coat (QBC) method, PCR and
serodiagnosis (only to be used exceptionally and in retrospect).

Rapid dipstick methods
Paracheck, ParaSight F, and Malaria PF Test antigen capture tests use
a monoclonal antibody to detect the histidine-rich protein II of P.
falciparum. These are useful in those who have not had malaria
before and require minimal expertise. However, they are expensive,
not quantitative, and detect only the presence of P. falciparum.
The OptiMAL® test detects parasite rather than human lactate
dehydrogenase — hence pLDH. This test can distinguish P. falciparum
from non-falciparum malaria infections.

PCR is very useful in epidemiological studies.

Fig. 2.3 Preparing blood film.

1. Clean the tip of the patient's left index finger.
2. Pierce the pulp of the fingertip with a sterile lancet or needle.
3. Squeeze the finger until a droplet of blood forms and place it onto
the middle of a clean slide (holding the slide by the edges). This is
for the thin film.
4. Place a further 3 droplets of blood onto the slide at a point to one
side of the first droplet. These are for the thick film.
5. Using a second clean slide as a spreader, touch the first, small
drop with the edge and allow the blood to run along its edge. With
the spreading slide at 45°, push the spreader forwards slowly,
ensuring even contact, so that the blood is spread as a thin film
over the surface of the slide. (See Fig. 2.3)
6. Using the corner of the spreading slide, amalgamate the 3 drops
of blood on the other half of the slide into a single small, denser
film about 1 cm in diameter.
7. Label the slide with a pencil and allow to dry horizontally.

Problems:
Badly positioned blood droplets, too much or too little blood, using

a greasy slide, a chipped edge of the spreader slide.

Staining:
(consult a laboratory manual for more details)

Giemsa stain:
may be used for both films but is costly and difficult to do. It should be
filtered before use. Thin films must first be fixed in anhydrous
methanol then dipped in 10% Giemsa for 20-30 mins; thick films in 5%
solution for 30 mins.

Field's stain:
uses 2 solutions, A and B, that are cheaper and more suited to rapid
bulk staining. For thick films, dip dried slides into solution A for 5 secs,
avoiding agitation. Wash in tap water (preferably neutral pH) for 5
secs, then dip into solution B for 3 secs. Wash again in water for 5 secs,
then allow to dry vertically. The centre of the film may not be stained,
but optimal parasite staining occurs at the edges of the film. For thin
films, use solution B before solution A.

Leishman's stain:
may be used for thin films. 0.5 ml stain is added to each horizontal
film, left for 30 secs, then 1.5 ml of buffered water added and left for 8
min. The slide is then washed in tap water.

Blood film identification of malarial parasites
1. Are there one or more red-stained chromatin dots and blue
cytoplasm?
YES — go to 2. NO — what you see is not a parasite.
2. Are the size and shape correct for a malaria parasite?
YES — go to 3. NO — what you see is not a malaria parasite.

3. Is there malaria pigment in the cell?
YES — go to 7. NO — go to 4.
4. Does the parasite have one chromatin dot attached to blue
cytoplasm in the form of a regular ring in the cytoplasm?
YES — this is a trophozoite. NO — go to 5.
5. Does the parasite have one chromatin dot attached to blue
cytoplasm in the form of a small solid or regular ring or with a
vacuole?
YES — this is a trophozoite. NO — go to 6.
6. Is the parasite with one chromatin dot irregular or fragmented?
YES — this is a trophozoite. NO — go to 8.
7. Does the parasite with malaria pigment have one chromatin dot?
YES — go to 8. NO — go to 9.
8. Does the parasite have a vacuole or is it fragmented in some way?
YES — this is probably a late trophozoite stage. NO — go to 11.
9. Does the parasite have 2 chromatin dots attached to a ring and have
a vacuole?
YES — this is a trophozoite. NO — go to 10.
10. Does the parasite have between 2 and 32 chromatin dots and
pigment?
YES — this is a schizont.
11. Is the parasite rounded or ‘banana-shaped’?
Rounded — go to 12. Banana-shaped — go to 14.
12. Does the rounded parasite have clearly stained chromatin and a
deep blue cytoplasm?
YES — this is a female gametocyte. NO — go to 13.
13. Does the rounded parasite have a reddish overall colour, so that the
chromatin is indistinct?

YES — this is a male gametocyte.
14. Does the ‘banana-shaped’ parasite have densely stained blue
cytoplasm and bright red chromatin?
YES — this is a female gametocyte. NO — go to 15.
15. Does the ‘banana-shaped’ parasite have a reddish overall colour, so
that the chromatin is indistinct?
YES — this is a male gametocyte.

General management
Decide whether the patient has falciparum malaria or a benign
malaria. If there are signs of severe falciparum infection, do not wait
for laboratory confirmation. Weigh the patient and start treatment
immediately.

Basic rules
In many instances, especially in endemic areas, uncomplicated
malaria can be treated on an outpatient basis.
Await blood film results for uncomplicated malaria.
Advise patients to return promptly if symptoms worsen or do not
improve within 48 h.
Beware of sending home patients who have mild symptoms but high
levels of parasitaemia since they may deteriorate rapidly.

All patients will require antimalarial
chemotherapy
Antimalarial treatment with appropriate antimalarial drugs should be
started immediately. Choose the drug regimen bearing in mind likely
compliance and side-effects, local resistance, and costs — see next
page. Take into account the locally recommended chemotherapy.

Many patients will need antipyretics and
analgesics
If fever causes distress or the child is prone to febrile convulsions, an
antipyretic should be given orally or by suppository. In two studies,

paracetamol has been shown to prolong parasite clearance, though the
clinical significance of this is unclear. Several studies demonstrated a
greater antipyretic effect with ibuprofen, which should be considered
if there are no contraindications. Avoid aspirin in children — both
because of Reye's syndrome and because aspirin can exacerbate
acidosis. For hyperpyrexia, begin tepid sponging and fanning quickly to
↓ the likelihood of febrile convulsions. Consider giving intramuscular
antipyretics.

Management
1. Assess the Airway, Breathing, and Circulation
and intervene where necessary. Record vital signs: temperature, pulse,
BP respiratory rate and capillary refill time (in children).

2. Obtain good quality venous access
and take blood for investigations including blood film, haemoglobin or
haematocrit, blood glucose, blood group and crossmatch. If available,
do blood culture, biochemistry (electrolytes, renal and liver function),
arterial blood gases analysis, and coagulation studies.

WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria 2006
The WHO guidelines encompass all of the recent important
developments in the treatment of malaria, both uncomplicated and
severe. The guideline development process was strictly evidencebased, and the resulting book is a valuable resource on all aspects
of treatment. The guidelines discuss in detail two major recent
developments in antimalarial therapy:
1. The wide acceptance and recommendation of artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) as the treatment of choice for
uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The main clinical advantages
of ACTs are a rapid therapeutic response and rapid initial
reduction in the parasite biomass; in addition, they reduce the
chance of drug resistance emerging and spreading and may —
through their gametocytocidal effect — interfere with

transmission.
2. The recommendation that artesunate, the most rapidly acting
parenteral antimalarial, is now the drug of choice in preference
to quinine for the treatment of severe malaria in low transmission
areas and in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and a
drug of choice alongside quinine in high transmission areas and in
the first trimester of pregnancy.
The complete guidelines can be downloaded as a PDF from the WHO
website on:
www.who.int/malaria/docs/TreatmentGuidelines2006.pdf

3. Treat hypoglycaemia
if present. Give 50% dextrose 50 ml (children: 10% dextrose 5 ml/kg) by
slow IV bolus if hypoglycaemic (blood glucose <2.2 mmol). Follow this
with 10% dextrose infusion (0.1 ml/kg/hr). Monitor blood glucose levels
4 to 6 hourly, especially following infusion of quinine.

4. Weigh patient and initiate antimalarial therapy
— see next page.

5. Consider empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy
if hypotensive or suspicion of bacterial infection (in Kenya
bacteraemia occurs in 8 to 12% of children with severe malaria).

6. Lumbar puncture
Patients with ↓ levels of consciousness should have a lumbar puncture
to exclude bacterial meningitis. If there is concern about raised
intracranial pressure, this can be delayed but antibiotic cover should
be given.

7. Assess hydration

Consider urinary catheterization and central venous line to monitor
the central venous pressure. Rehydration may be required, particularly
if diarrhoea and vomiting are present. Aggressive fluid resuscitation in
children with severe malaria may be indicated but is controversial.
Adults with severe falciparum malaria usually require 1-3 L of isotonic
saline over the first 24 h — however, avoid overhydration.

8. Monitor renal output
and BP hourly, and aim to keep central venous pressure (if available) in
the low-normal range.

9. Blood transfusion
with pathogen-free, compatible fresh blood or packed cells should be
considered in patients with a haematocrit <15% or Hb <5 g/dl.
Transfusion should be given urgently in children with a Hb <4 g/dl or a
Hb <5 g/dl with respiratory distress or acidosis or parasitaemia >10%; in
such cases, give blood 10 ml/kg over 30 mins, then a further 10 ml/kg
over 2-3 h without diuretics. In DIC, fresh blood, clotting factors (FFP),
and/or platelets should be given as required.

10. Exchange transfusion
can be considered in some situations, especially parasitaemias >30%,
although it has not been subject to a randomized controlled trial.

11. Dialysis
if the patient is oliguric and develops renal failure — haemofiltration
or haemodialysis may be indicated. Peritoneal dialysis should be used
if these are unavailable but is less effective.

12. Oxygen and mechanical ventilation
may be required for patients with respiratory distress or significantly
raised ICP. If distress is due to pulmonary oedema, the patient should
be nursed at 45° and IV diuretics given. Haemofiltration may be used if
available.

13. Inotropes
such as dopamine may be given through a central line if hypotension
does not respond to volume expansion. Adrenaline should be avoided
as it can exacerbate acidosis.

Cerebral malaria
Treat as above with the following additional specific measures:
Nurse the patient on her side to avoid aspiration of vomit. Turn
every two hours.
The patient should be catheterized and have temperature, heart
and respiratory rates, BP, and fluid balance measured regularly.
Consciousness must be assessed regularly with the Glasgow or
Blantyre Coma Scales.
Hypoglycaemia must be treated promptly but is very difficult to
detect in an unconscious patient. Blood sugar should be actively
monitored at least 4-6 hourly and whenever there is any
deterioration in the patient's clinical condition.
If convulsions arise — be alert since they may be subtle — treat
with diazepam 0.30 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 10 mg in adults)
by slow IV injection. An alternative is diazepam 0.5 mg/kg
rectally. Hypoglycaemia must be sought and treated if present.
Avoid corticosteroids, mannitol, or other ancillary agents for
cerebral oedema since they are of no proven benefit.

Antimalarial chemotherapy
There have been recent major changes in the treatment of malaria,
particularly the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)
for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria and the
emergence of parenteral artesunate as the drug of choice for severe
malaria. Resistance to many antimalarial drugs is an increasing
problem worldwide and it is important to have up-to-date information
on local resistance patterns. Chloroquine, for example, can no longer
be used to treat falciparum malaria in most parts of the world. At the

time of writing (2007) there is no clinically apparent resistance to the
artemisinin derivatives, though resistance to the partner drugs in the
ACT combinations is a major problem in many areas.

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)
Combination therapy is the simultaneous use of two or more blood
schizonticidal agents with independent modes of action. The aim is to
reduce the spread of resistance, with the two components protecting
each other. This principle has been widely applied in the treatment of
HIV/AIDS and TB. In ACTs, one of these agents is an artemisinin
derivative, the most rapidly acting class of antimalarial. This ensures a
rapid fall in parasitaemia, reducing the total number of parasites at
risk of developing resistance. Artemisinin derivatives are also
gametocytocidal and thus may reduce malaria transmission.
Partial courses of ACTs should not be given, even when patients are
considered to be semi-immune or the diagnosis is uncertain — this may
encourage the development of resistance.

Treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum
malaria
In the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, the aim is to reduce the
parasitaemia as quickly as possible and to prevent recrudescence of
the infection. Antimalarial drugs are given orally if tolerated. If the
species is unknown or there is mixed infection, treat as falciparum
malaria.
ACTs are now the recommended treatment of choice for
uncomplicated falciparum malaria worldwide. Monotherapy is
specifically discouraged.
Be aware of local patterns of resistance, particularly to the
artemisinin derivative partner drug. These will influence the firstline ACT for the area.
Treatment failures within 14 days of receiving an ACT should be
treated with a second-line antimalarial (see below).

Treatment failures (recurrent parasitaemia) after 14 days can be
retreated with the original first-line ACT. However, retreatment
with mefloquine within 28 days is associated with an ↑ risk of
neuropsychiatric disorder, so if the first-line ACT was artesunate +
mefloquine, a second-line antimalarial should be given.

Treatment of the benign malarias
The standard recommended treatment remains chloroquine 25 mg
base/kg divided over 3 days (e.g. 10 mg base/kg followed by 5 mg
base/kg at 6 h, 24 h, and 36 h).
The hypnozoite stages of P. ovale and P. vivax are not affected by
blood scizonticides such as chloroquine, so to prevent relapses
and effect a ‘radical cure’, the liver schizonticide, primaquine,
must be given as well (0.25 mg base/kg daily (0.375-0.5 mg
base/kg daily in SE Asia and Oceania where relatively primaquineresistant strains occur)). P. malariae does not produce hypnozoite
forms.
Primaquine is an oxidant and causes haemolysis in G6PD-deficient
individuals. Screening is generally unavailable, but in areas where
mild G6PD deficiency is the common variant, primaquine in
weekly doses of 0.75 mg base/kg for 8 weeks is better tolerated.
Primaquine should not be given in severe G6PD deficiency. It
should also not be given to pregnant women.
Chloroquine-resistant P. vivax is increasingly a problem
(particularly in Oceania, Indonesia, and Peru), and can be treated
with amodiaquine 10 mg base/kg daily for 3 days, combined with
primaquine.
The benign malarias are susceptible to all ACTs (the exception being
P. vivax and artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine(SP), since P.
vivax responds poorly to SP monotherapy in many areas).
Primaquine would still be required for radical cure.

Radical cures and primaquine
Treatment with a blood schizontocidal drug, such as quinine, will
not eliminate parasites from the liver. Therefore, patients

infected with P. vivax or P. ovale are also given primaquine to kill
the liver hypnozoites and prevent recrudescence later. P. malariae
does not produce persistent liver forms.
Since primaquine is also gametocidal, it is sometimes given to
patients infected with P. falciparum in non-endemic regions. This
prevents the blood gametocytes being taken up by local
mosquitoes and possibly initiating local foci of infections.
A major drawback is primaquine's ability to cause severe
intravascular haemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Weekly
doses of 45 mg for up to 8 weeks are better tolerated in such
patients than daily doses of 15 mg for 14-21 days.
Relatively primaquine-resistant strains of P. vivax have been
reported (in the Pacific region) that require at least 6 mg/kg total
dose (~2 × normal dose).

Currently recommended ACTs
Artemether + lumefantrine (Co-artem®, Riamet®):
fixed-dose combination (artemether 20 mg/lumefantrine 120 mg in
each tablet) suitable for use in areas of multidrug resistance (SE Asia)
as well as worldwide. Six doses over 3 days. Should be taken with milk
or fat-containing food. Now recommended for children ≥5 kg.

Adult dose:
(body wt >35 kg): 4 tablets at 0 h, 8 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 60 h.
Paediatric dose: reduce the number of tablets at each dose: body wt
25-34 kg, 3 tablets per dose; 15-24 kg, 2 per dose; 5-14 kg, 1 per dose.

Artesunate + mefloquine:
the prototype ACT, with a fixed-dose combination under development.
Suitable for use in areas of multidrug resistance (SE Asia); effective
elsewhere but expensive. Currently available as separate scored
artesunate (50 mg) and mefloquine (250 mg base) tablets. 3 day course.

Adult dose (>13 yrs):
artesunate 200 mg on days 1, 2, and 3; mefloquine 1000 mg on day 2
and 500 mg on day 3.

Paediatric doses:
7-13 yrs, artesunate 100 mg on days 1, 2, and 3, mefloquine 500 mg on
day 2 and 250 mg on day 3; 1-6 yrs: artesunate 50 mg on days 1, 2, and
3, mefloquine 250 mg on day 2; 5-11 months: artesunate 25 mg (1/2
tablet) on days 1, 2, and 3; mefloquine 125 mg (1/2 tablet) day 2.

Artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP):
currently available as separate scored artesunate (50 mg) and SP
(500/25 mg) tablets. Only suitable for areas where SP monotherapy 28day cure rates exceed 80%. Useful in some parts of Africa but these are
diminishing rapidly.

Adult dose (>13 yrs):
artesunate 200 mg on days 1, 2 and 3; SP 3 tablets (1500/75 mg) on day
1.

Paediatric doses:
7-13 yrs, artesunate 100 mg on days 1, 2, and 3, SP 2 tablets (1000/50
mg) on day 1; 1-6 yrs: artesunate 50 mg on days 1, 2, and 3, SP 1 tablet
(500/25 mg) on day 1; 5-11 months: artesunate 1/2 tablet (25 mg) on
days 1, 2, and 3, SP 1/2 tablet (250/12.5 mg) on day 1.

Artesunate + amodiaquine:
now available as a fixed-dose combination (each adult tablet contains
artesunate/amodiaquine 100/270 mg, paediatric tablet 25/67.5 mg).
Only suitable for areas where amodiaquine monotherapy 28-day cure
rates exceed 80% (mainly West Africa).

Adult dose (>13 yrs):

2 adult tablets once daily for 3 days.

Paediatric doses:
7-13 yrs, 1 adult tablet once daily for 3 days; 1-7 yrs, 2 paediatric
tablets once daily for 3 days; <1 yr, 1 paediatric tablet once daily for 3
days (not officially recommended for infants <24 months).

ACTs under development
Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) + piperaquine (Artekin©) is a promising
fixed-dose combination, already used in Cambodia and Vietnam. It
is suitable for treating multidrug-resistant malaria, cheap, and
should be available soon in a GMP formulation. Artesunate +
pyronaridine and artesunate + chlorproguanil-dapsone combinations
are also under development.

Non-artemisinin based combination therapies
SP + chloroquine is not recommended as resistance to both
components is already widespread and no synergy has been
demonstrated. SP + amodiaquine in areas of parasite sensitivity may
be more effective than either drug alone but less rapidly acting than
ACTs. Therefore only recommended when ACTs are unavailable.

Second-line antimalarials for falciparum malaria
Used in cases of treatment failure <14 days after receiving an ACT.
In order of preference they are:
1. an alternative ACT known to be effective in the region (generally
a 3-day course).
2. artesunate (2 mg/kg od) plus either tetracycline (4 mg/kg q6 h) or
doxycycline (3.5 mg/kg od) or clindamycin (10 mg/kg q12 h).
3. quinine (10 mg salt/kg q8 h) plus either tetracycline (4 mg/kg q6
h) or doxycycline (3.5 mg/kg od) or clindamycin (10 mg/kg q12 h).
Regimens 2 and 3 should be given for 7 days. The quinine regimens
are poorly tolerated and adherence is often poor. Doxycycline and
tetracycline should not be used in pregnancy or in children under 8

yrs.

Pregnant women
First trimester: quinine and clindamycin (see doses above) given
for 7 days. If clindamycin is unavailable, give quinine
monotherapy. Use an ACT if it is the only effective treatment
available.
Second and third trimesters: an ACT that is known to be effective
in the region, or artesunate + clindamycin (7 days) or quinine +
clindamycin (7 days).

Treatment of severe malaria
Severe malaria is a medical emergency. Full doses of parenteral
antimalarial therapy should be started immediately and continued
until the patient is well enough to take oral follow-on treatment (see
below). The options are:

1. Artesunate
2.4 mg/kg IV or IM at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, then once daily. Artesunate is the
WHO recommended therapy in low transmission or non-malaria
endemic areas, and a recommended therapy in high transmission
areas.
In a multi-country study of severe malaria, IV artesunate was
associated with a 35% relative reduction in mortality compared with
IV quinine.
The currently available formulation of artesunate is non-GMP,
although it is this formulation that has demonstrated superior
efficacy over quinine in low transmission areas. A GMP formulation is
being developed.

2. Quinine
20 mg salt/kg loading dose on admission, then 10 mg salt/kg q8 h

thereafter, each dose given by rate-controlled IV infusion over 4 h or
by divided IM injection. It is a WHO recommended therapy in high
transmission areas.
For IV infusion, quinine must be diluted in 5-10 ml/kg body weight of
dextrose or saline solution. For IM use, quinine should be diluted in
normal saline to 60 mg salt/ml and half the dose given in each
anterior thigh. IM injection can cause abscess formation and has
been associated with the development of tetanus.
Quinine is associated with severe hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia,
particularly in pregnant women.
In acute renal failure or hepatic dysfunction, the dose should be
reduced by one third after 48 h to prevent accumulation and
resulting toxicity. Dose adjustment in renal failure is unnecessary if
the patient is receiving haemofiltration or haemodialysis.
The first dose can be reduced to 10 mg salt/kg if there is certainty
that the patient has received adequate pre-treatment with quinine
before presentation. If in doubt, give the loading dose.

3. Artemether
IM into the anterior thigh 3.2 mg/kg then 1.6 mg/kg per day.
Artemether absorption from IM injection is erratic, especially in very
ill patients. It is a WHO recommended therapy in high transmission
areas.

4. Quinidine
If the other, recommended, parenteral antimalarials are unavailable
(e.g. in the USA), the anti-arrhythmic drug quinidine (an enantiomer of
quinine) may be used. Give 15 mg base/kg infused IV over 4 h, followed
by 7.5 mg base/kg over 4 h q8 h. Cardiac monitoring is required. Dose
adjustments are necessary in renal failure and hepatic impairment as
for quinine. Convert to oral therapy as soon as possible.

Pregnancy
Give the parenteral antimalarial used locally for severe malaria in

full doses. Because quinine causes severe recurrent hypoglycaemia,
where available, artesunate is the first choice and artemether the
second choice in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. As little evidence is
available in the 1st trimester, artesunate, quinine, and artemether
may all be considered options.

Pre-referral treatment
Rectal artesunate is well absorbed and is an option to buy time and
prevent progression of severe disease while referral to a health care
facility capable of giving parenteral treatment is made. Quinine can
also be given intrarectally in such circumstances.

Follow-on treatment
Following initial parenteral therapy, when the patient is well
enough to take oral medication, an oral antimalarial should be
given to complete treatment and prevent recrudescence. Complete
7 days' treatment with an oral formulation of the parenteral drug +
7 days of doxycycline or clindamycin (in children and pregnant
women). Alternatively, a standard full course of oral ACT can be
given.

Chemoprophylaxis
Chemoprophylaxis against malaria rarely provides full protection and
measures should be taken at all times to reduce the number of
mosquito bites. Use insect repellents containing DEET (10 to 50%) or
picardin (7%), and sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets in areas
where mosquitoes bite indoors at night. Individuals should be aware of
malarial symptoms, which may be non-specific, and report early for a
blood film if malaria is suspected.

Travellers to malarial areas:
should preferably begin prophylaxis 1 week (2-3 weeks in the case of
mefloquine) before arrival, and must continue for 4 weeks after

departure, except in the cases of atovaquone-proguanil and
primaquine where prophylaxis may be commenced the day before
entry into a malarious area and ended 7 days after return from a
malarious area.
Any febrile illness occurring within 1 year of travel could be malaria.
For long-term, non-immune residents there is a balance between the
risks of infection and the side-effects of chemoprophylaxis. It may be
possible to target prophylaxis during the transmission season alone.

Malaria endemic areas:
antimalarial prophylaxis is not logistically or financially feasible.
Intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) is an alternative which
shows some promise and may work at least partly through its
prophylactic effects.

Drugs used in prophylaxis
Atovaquone-proguanil, mefloquine, doxycycline, and primaquine can
all be used as prophylaxis throughout the malaria endemic world,
whereas the usefulness of chloroquine and proguanil has been severely
restricted by resistance.

1. Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®):
well-tolerated, once-daily, fixed-dose combination effective against all
types of malaria, including multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria.
Should be taken with food and a milky drink to improve absorption.
There is insufficient data to recommend its use in pregnancy, and it is
very expensive.

Dose:
adult daily dose 250/100 mg; 3.75/1.5 mg/kg in children <13 yrs.

2. Mefloquine:
now a favoured drug for the prophylaxis of malaria in many areas

where chloroquine resistance is present.
Nausea, dizziness, and vivid dreams are common side-effects, and
approximately 1 in 10,000 recipients develops an acute reversible
neuropsychiatric reaction. Mefloquine is not recommended in neonates
but has been used for prophylaxis in pregnancy.

Dose:
250 mg PO weekly in adults & children >45 kg (62.5 mg weekly in
children 6-16 kg; 125 mg for 16-25 kg, 187.5 mg for 25-45 kg).

3. Doxycycline:
useful as an alternate to mefloquine.

Dose:
1.5 mg/kg PO once daily, up to a max of 100 mg. Do not use in children
<8 yrs and in pregnant and lactating women.

4. Primaquine:
has proven in adults to be effective and safe against drug resistant P.
falciparum and P. vivax. Should be taken with food to reduce
gastrointestinal side-effects. Should not be given to G6PD-deficient
individuals or pregnant women.

Dose:
0.5 mg base/kg or 30 mg, daily adult dose.

5. Proguanil:
used for prophylaxis in pregnant women and non-immune people in
areas of low risk only. It is more commonly used in combination with
chloroquine (see below). Of limited use now due to resistance.

Dose:

200 mg PO daily in adults, including pregnant women. Children <12 wks
25 mg/day; 12 wks-1 yr 50 mg/day; 1-4 yrs 75 mg/day; 5-8 yrs 100
mg/day, and 9-14 yrs 150 mg/day.
A folic acid supplement should be taken during pregnancy.

6. Chloroquine:
is used in combination with proguanil in low-risk areas, in pregnant
women, and in individuals who cannot tolerate other antimalarials. It
is not effective against most P. falciparum strains worldwide and
resistance in P. vivax is also increasing.

Dose:
300 mg (as base) PO weekly in adults, including pregnant women.
Children require 5 mg/kg weekly.
See http://www.rbm.who.int/wmr2005/html/map5.htm for
information on areas with resistant malaria.

Monitoring antimalarial drug resistance
With the rapid recent spread of drug resistance, there is an increased
need to monitor the current levels of resistance to provide evidence to
inform the choice of antimalarial drug therapy and ensure proper
management of clinical cases. The monitoring systems available
include:

1. Therapeutic efficacy testing:
the WHO have developed a protocol for in vivo testing of the efficacy
of antimalarial drugs against P. falciparum in the field
(www.who.int/malaria/docs/ProtocolWHO.pdf). It is a simple one arm
trial, with the treatment outcomes classified into:

Early treatment failure (ETF)
Development of danger signs or severe malaria on days 1 to 3 in the
presence of parasitaemia.

Parasitaemia on day 2 higher than the day 0 count irrespective of
axillary temperature.
Parasitaemia on day 3 with axillary temperature ≥37.5°C.
Parasitaemia on day 3 that is ≥25% of count on day 0.

Late clinical failure (LCF)
Development of danger signs or severe malaria after day 3 in the
presence of parasitaemia, without previously meeting any ETF
criteria.
Presence of parasitaemia and axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C on any
day from day 4 to day 28, without previously meeting any ETF
criteria.

Late parasitological failure (LPF)
Presence of parasitaemia on any day from day 7 to day 28 and
axillary temperature <37.5°C, without previously meeting any of the
criteria of ETF or LCF.

Adequate clinical and parasitological response
(ACPR)
Absence of parasitaemia on day 28 irrespective of axillary
temperature without previously meeting any of the criteria of ETC
or LCF or LPF.
‘Clinical failure’ can be summarized as ETF + LCF.
‘Total failure’ can be summarized as ETF + LCF + LPF.

2. In vitro resistance tests:
technologically demanding and limited by exclusion of host factors and
parasite factors unrelated to resistance. These tests are useful for
providing additional information to support clinical efficacy data.

3. Molecular markers:
if the molecular basis for resistance is known, these techniques can
provide early warning of the presence of resistance to a range of
antimalarial tests in a parasite population and guide therapeutic
choices in epidemic situations. They do not always correlate well with
therapeutic efficacy.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Malaria control
The three main limbs of malaria control are:
1. Effective antimalarial drug treatment, particularly
with ACTs which may reduce transmission through
their gametocytocidal effect.
2. Vector control by insecticide spraying, particularly
indoor, and larval control (draining stagnant water,
removing litter and debris that retain water and
provide a mosquito breeding ground, and use of
larvicides and larvivorous fish).
3. Personal protection with insecticide-impregnated
materials such as bed nets and curtains.
Education
of the population on the importance and practical
application of all three of these is a pre-requisite for
success.
The resources to apply these principles have
benefited through major investment from e.g. Global
Fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria & Tuberculosis, the Roll
Back Malaria Initiative, and the President's Malaria
Initiative. Unfortunately, eradication is not yet
feasible because of the huge number of infected
individuals, the ecological success of the vectors, the

continued widespread use of ineffective drugs, and
the underresourced health care and public health
infrastructure in many parts of the tropical world.
The current aims are to reduce morbidity, prevent
mortality, and reduce socio-economic loss. There
have been some successes: malaria incidence has
been greatly reduced in some areas of unstable
transmission, such as Vietnam, Thailand, and South
Africa; and in East and West Africa, widespread
deployment of insecticide-treated bed nets has been
shown to reduce mortality.
A malaria vaccine has been the holy grail of malaria
researchers for decades, but while there have been
major recent advances, an effective, deployable
vaccine is still a long way off. Further research is
needed into the biology of the vector and the
parasite and their interaction with the human host,
the pathophysiology of the disease process, and the
socio-cultural factors that determine health-seeking
behaviour and compliance with drug regimens. In
particular, there is an urgent need to discover and
develop novel classes of antimalarial drug if we are
not to face a malaria control catastrophe if and when
the parasite develops resistance to the artemisinin
derivatives.

HIV infection/AIDS
The human immunodeficiency viruses are the cause of the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) global pandemic.

Epidemiology
The first AIDS cases were recognized in the USA in 1981 and it is
estimated that to date >25 million people have died as a result of HIV
infection worldwide. An estimated 40 million people are living with
HIV infection worldwide: 38 million adults and 2 million children <15
years old. 60% of those with HIV infection live in sub-saharan Africa,
where 7% of the adult population is HIV infected. Seroprevalence rates
among pregnant women are 30-40% in certain southern African nations.
There are also rapidly growing HIV epidemics in eastern Europe and in
central and east Asia.
HIV-1 accounts for most cases in the global pandemic; HIV-2 infection is
found mainly in West Africa and people from that region. It has 40-60%
genetic homology with HIV-1. It is less transmissible and is associated
with a slower rate of CD4 and clinical decline. Many patients with HIV2 are co-infected with HIV-1. 3rd generation ELISAs will diagnose both
HIV-1 and 2 whereas earlier generation ELISAs and some of the rapid

tests only diagnose HIV-1. HIV-1 viral load assays will not detect HIV-2.
HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to the non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and may carry pre-existing protease
inhibitor (PI) mutations.

Transmission
Potentially infectious bodily fluids are: blood, serous effusions,
cerebrospinal fluid, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. Urine,
vomitus, and saliva are non-infectious unless they are contaminated
with blood. The virus survives poorly in the environment: no cases of
environmental transmission are documented.
The main routes of HIV transmission are:
Unprotected sexual intercourse (both heterosexual and homosexual).
STIs, particularly those that cause genital ulceration, increase the
risk of sexual transmission. In the developing world, heterosexual
intercourse is the major mode of transmission for adults.
Mother to child transmission (the highest risk is at the time of
delivery, but transmission may also occur during the pregnancy or
via breast milk). In the absence of preventative strategies, the risk
of transmission in non-breastfeeding populations is 15-30%, but
increases to 20-45% in breastfeeding women.
Receipt of infected blood products (screening of blood products
minimizes this risk).
Injections or treatments with unsterile needles, syringes, surgical
apparutus, or skin-piercing instruments.
Needlestick injuries to health care workers. The risk is estimated to
be 0.3% if no post-exposure prophylaxis is administered.

2006. Source UNAIDS and WHO.

Virology and immunology
Once HIV infects a human it attaches to and enters immune cells that
bear the CD4 protein on their surface — mainly CD4 T-lymphocytes and
macrophages. Within these cells, the virus replicates using viral
enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and protease as well as
hijacking human cellular mechanisms for RNA and protein production.
During this process, copies of viral DNA are inserted into the
chromosomal DNA of the host cell. Billions of new HIV particles are
formed daily in this way in an infected person. The immune system
responds by destroying the formed viruses, keeping the circulating
virus at a constant or ‘setpoint’. This results in a state of immune
activation that persists for many years, during which the CD4 count

slowly declines from the normal count of 500-1400 cells/mm3. CD4 Tlymphocytes coordinate the body's immune response and, as their
numbers fall during the late stages of AIDS, profound
immunosuppression results. This predisposes the patient to a variety of
infections that would not normally cause disease in an
immunocompetent person — so-called ‘opportunistic’ infections. The
specific opportunistic infections that occur depend on both the
geographical area and the patient's degree of immunosuppression.
Certain tumours, caused by viruses, are more common in AIDS
patients: lymphomas (due to EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma (herpesvirus
KSHV or HHV-8). AIDS-related conditions usually occur when the CD4 is
<200 cells/mm3.
There is no vaccine and no cure for the viral infection itself. Good
therapies have been developed, however, for many of the
opportunistic infections. Combination antiretroviral treatment (ART)
can control viral replication and allow a considerable restoration of
immune function that can last for many years.

Clinical phases of HIV infection
HIV infection progresses from a seroconversion illness soon after
infection through a long asymptomatic period to symptomatic disease
and AIDS.

Acute retroviral illness
An acute retroviral illness occurs in about 50% of patients 2-5 weeks
after infection. It lasts from 3 to 21 days. It is similar to infectious
mononucleosis with variable signs and symptoms that include malaise,
fever, sore throat, myalgia, anorexia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhoea,
nausea, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a maculo-papular eruption
involving the trunk and arms. Rare complications include aseptic
meningoencephalitis and mono/polyneuritis. Atypical lymphocytes may
be seen in the blood film. There may be significant temporary
immunosuppression during the acute infection with opportunistic
infections having been reported during this period.

Asymptomatic HIV infection
An asymptomatic stage, during which the body's immune system
attempts to control the virus, follows seroconversion. The virus itself
is not latent at this stage but is in balance with the immune system.
Billions of virus particles are produced and destroyed each day. The
only sign of infection during this period may be generalized
lymphadenopathy, probably due to HIV. The asymptomatic stage varies
in length but ends when immune system dysfunction produces
symptoms.

Symptomatic HIV infection
Symptoms occur as the immune system's function becomes
compromised. These are initially mild, such as skin rashes and
recurrent throat infections, but later the patient suffers from
opportunistic infections, as well as the direct effects of HIV itself.
Weight loss, weakness, and loss of functional capacity are common.
Opportunistic infections attack multiple systems. Certain opportunistic
infections become more common as the CD4 count falls, and this is
reflected in the WHO's staging system.

Fig. 3.2 Course of HIV infection in adults (Adapted with permission

from G. Pantaleo et al. The immuno pathogenesis of human
immunodeficiency virus infection, N Engl J Med, 1993, 328(5): 32735.)

WHO clinical staging system for HIV infection
and disease
This staging system was developed for epidemiological purposes. It is
useful for estimating progression of HIV-related immunosuppression
and making decisions about the need for co-trimoxazole prophylaxis
and starting or switching ART. The presence of any of these
manifestations in a previously healthy adult should suggest HIV
infection. Any suspicion of HIV infection should be confirmed by
laboratory tests.
The stages are (see box):
1 — asymptomatic
2 — mild symptoms
3 — advanced
4 — severe
In the absence of ART, the average time course from infection to AIDS
is 9 years. Some patients are rapid progressors and may develop AIDS
just a few years after infection. Typically, these patients have high
viral load setpoints with rapid CD4 decline. Other patients may be slow
progressors with slow CD4 and clinical decline. Opportunistic
infections, in particular TB, may accelerate HIV disease by causing an
increase in viral replication and the viral setpoint. HIV wasting
syndrome is defined as weight loss of >10%, plus either unexplained
diarrhoea (lasting >1 month) or chronic weakness and unexplained
fever for >1 month.

Laboratory tests in HIV infection
There are three main purposes for which HIV antibody testing is
performed:
Transfusion/transplant safety: screening of donated blood and organs
to prevent HIV transmission.
Surveillance: unlinked and anonymous testing to monitor prevalence
and trends in HIV infection in a given population.
Diagnosis of HIV infection: voluntary testing of serum from
asymptomatic persons or from persons with clinical signs and
symptoms suggestive of HIV infection or AIDS.
Screening requires sensitive tests that will pick up all contaminated
blood/organs. By contrast diagnosis requires high specificity so that
there are few false positives. The diagnosis of HIV can be made by the
detection of HIV itself or the detection of antibodies to HIV.
Tests for virus are:
HIV viral RNA PCR.
Integrated HIV viral DNA.
P24 antigen ELISA.

Tests for antibodies to the virus.
1st, 2nd, 3rd generation ELISA.
Rapid tests (point-of-care tests employ ELISA methodology; they
have been shown to have sensitivity and specificity similar to ELISA).
Western Blot.
4th generation combo-ELISA able to detect antibodies and p24.
All tests have a ‘window period’ (the interval during initial infection
between the patient becoming infected and the test becoming
positive). Important window periods are: HIV RNA PCR, 10 days; P24
antigen, 17 days; 3rd generation ELISA, 22 days. Antibody tests are
positive in virtually 100% of patients by 3 months, unless post-exposure
prophylaxis was taken that may delay seroconversion.
Diagnostic tests for HIV infection should never be considered as
positive, and the patient informed, until they have been confirmed by
a second assay. The WHO recommends two tests be used to diagnose
HIV in the clinical setting. The first screening test may be an ELISA or a
rapid test and should have a high sensitivity to avoid false negatives.
The second confirmatory test should be a second ELISA, a second rapid
test, or a Western blot. The second test should have high specificity to
avoid false positives. Two separate blood specimens should be used. A
flow chart for the use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of HIV is shown in
Fig. 3.3. The second rapid test should use different antigen specificity
or a different platform.

HIV viral load:
(copies/ml) determines the amount of virus circulating in blood. A
higher viral load correlates with more rapid progression.

CD4 count:
is measured by FACS. It is used to assess the degree of
immunosuppression and decide on the need for prophylaxis and ART.

Fig. 3.3 Rapid HIVtests: guidelines for use in HIV testing and
counselling services in resource-constrained settings (Source:
WHO, 2004).

Voluntary consent and testing (VCT)
Before being tested for HIV, patients should receive pre-test
counselling and should consent to the test. This respects their rights
and prepares them for the result. It has been demonstrated to modify

subsequent risk-taking behaviour, thereby reducing further
transmission.

Pre-test counselling
Pre-test counselling should include:
The assurance of confidentiality.
Exploration of the patient's knowledge and beliefs regarding HIV.
Education around HIV, its transmission, prevention, clinical course,
and treatment. Discuss the ‘window period’.
Discussion regarding benefits of testing (prophylaxis, ART, prevention
of transmission to sexual partner).
Exploration of consequences of positive and negative test. Discuss
patient's support systems and coping strategies.
Discussion of issues of disclosure of positive result and obligation to
inform sexual partners.
Documentation of consent (written or verbal).
Arrangement of follow-up for result.

Post-test counselling
Post-test counselling for a positive result ideally should consist of two
or more sessions. Many patients will be in a state of shock when first
told the result and ‘information overload’ should be avoided in the
first session. The session(s) should:
Include feedback about the result, preferably with a written copy.
Allow expression of emotions and dicussion about them.
Identify immediate concerns and plans.
Identify supports and include discussion of disclosure, especially to
sexual partner.
Include talk about safe sex and other risk reduction, healthy
lifestyle, treatment, and prophylaxis of opportunistic infections and

ART.
Arrange follow-up and/or referral.
If necessary, offer psychological or psychiatric referral, since some
patients become depressed after a positive result.
If the result is negative, post-test counselling should focus on a
discussion of the ‘window period’ and the need for a repeat test in 3
months and re-inforce prevention messages. The emphasis should be
on the person staying negative.

Management of asymptomatic HIV infection

P.78

Counselling
The general purpose is to promote and maintain the maximum possible
level of psychological and physical health among infected people, their
partners and relatives, and caregivers. It has two aims:
To support the ability of infected persons and those who care for
them to cope with the stresses of HIV/AIDS.
To prevent the transmission of HIV to others.

Medical management
of asymptomatic persons with HIV has the following aims:
Early detection of HIV-associated disease and treatment.
Primary prophylaxis when indicated.
Determination of the appropriate time to start antiretroviral
therapy.
Knowledge of the CD4 count assists in interpretation of symptoms and
when to initiate primary prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy.
Frequency of visits should increase as CD4 count falls.
On history, in high TB incidence settings, specifically ask about TB
symptoms (cough, night sweats, and weight loss).

Physical examination should include:
General: weight loss, fever.
Neurological system: peripheral neuropathy, cognitive disorders.
Skin changes: herpes zoster, herpes simplex, folliculitis, tinea, KS,
pruritus, seborrhoeic dermatitis, psoriasis.
Oral cavity: thrush, hairy leukoplakia, gingivitis, KS, lymphoma.
Eyes: perform fundoscopy, especially if visual symptoms.
Lymph nodes (see section on lymphadenopathy below).
Lungs: check for consolidation and crepitations.
Abdominal examination: hepatosplenomegaly.
Genitalia: chancre, ulcers.
Anus: ulcers, warts.
Tests to assess the degree of immunodeficiency may be considered in
asymptomatic patients:
Total lymphocyte count (poor marker).
CD4 lymphocyte count.
Total lymphocyte count fluctuates greatly due to concurrent infections
— it is only a crude guide to CD4 status and degree of immune
deficiency. CD4 count is the best indicator of the immediate prognosis.
Rate of CD4 decline indicates longer-term prognosis. Serial viral RNA
measurements prior to initiating ART add very little to management.
Other investigations should be directed by clinical problems.

Drug therapy:
primary prophylaxis and administration of vaccines is valuable. Local
prevalence of the following infections will determine whether primary
prophylaxis or vaccination should be offered: TB, pneumocystis
pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, pneumococcal pneumonia.
P.80

Symptomatic HIV infection
Acute fevers
When an HIV-infected patient presents with a febrile illness, the
differential diagnosis is wide and investigations should be directed by
history and examination. Infections that are common in a geographical
location will often be more frequent and severe in the HIV-infected
population. There are also distinctive geographical patterns for HIVrelated opportunistic infections (e.g. penicilliosis frequent in parts of
SE Asia and China). Always consider TB as a cause of systemic illness in
an HIV-infected person.

History:
Duration of symptoms, localizing symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, focal
pain, headache, diarrhoea or dysentery, dysuria, genital discharge),
weight loss, night sweats, travel history.

Examination:
Do serial weights, feel for lymphadenopathy (see below), elicit signs of
pneumonia, examine the ears, nose, and throat, and look for skin
rashes, oral ulcers, and neck stiffness.

Investigations:
to consider:
CRP (↑ CRP suggests OI rather than HIV wasting syndrome).
CD4 (influences differential diagnosis).
Blood culture.
Urine microscopy and culture.
Stool microscopy and culture (if the patient has diarrhoea).
Sputum and other specimens (e.g. induced sputum or urine) for TB
microscopy and culture.

Needle aspiration of nodes >2 cm.
Malaria smears in endemic areas or traveller from endemic area.
Bone marrow biopsy if pancytopaenic.
Lumbar puncture if headaches (to exclude bacterial, cryptococcal,
and tuberculous meningitis).
Aspirate effusions for bacterial and TB microscopy and culture.
Skin biopsy if patients have a disseminated rash.
Chest radiograph.
Ultrasound abdomen and pericardium (abdominal nodes, pericardial
effusion, splenic lesions, ascites suggest TB in endemic areas and,
less commonly, fungal infection or lymphoma).
In patients with acute illness and fever it is usually necessary to
distinguish between viral illness (accompanied by symptoms of coryza,
pharyngitis, or tracheobroncitis with normal CRP and WCC) or bacterial
sepsis e.g.:
Sinusitis.
Pneumonia.
Urinary tract infection.
Meningitis (cryptococcal meningitis and TBM may also present
acutely).
Diarrhoea or dysentry (shigella, salmonella, campylobacter).
Pyomyositis or septic arthritis.
PID or other STI.
Other septicaemiac illnesses (non-typhoidal Salmonella
septicaemias, staphylococcal septicaemias and others).
Consider malaria in endemic areas or returning travellers.

Subacute and chronic fevers
The following should be considered:

Tuberculosis — pulmonary and/or extrapulmonary (the most common
cause of HIV-related morbidity and mortality in the developing
world). HIV-infected patients are frequently smear-negative and may
have atypical chest radiograph changes. In endemic areas, if the
diagnosis of TB is strongly suspected clinically or radiologically but
smears are negative, it is sometimes necessary to commence
empiric TB treatment with close follow-up to prevent further clinical
decline before the diagnosis can be microbiologically proven.
Fungal infections (cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, penicilliosis, and
others — vary according to geographical location).
PCP (accompanied by dry cough and exertional dyspnoea).
Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (disseminated
mycobacterium avium complex is the most common).
Nocardiosis.
Bacillary angiomatosis (systemic bartonella infection with
characteristic angiomatous nodules on the skin).
Malignancies (lymphoma, disseminated Kaposi sarcoma).
Pyogenic bacterial collections (empyema, intra-abdominal).
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
Enteric pathogens (e.g. isosporiasis and cryptosporidiosis, usually
with diarrhoea and/or vomiting).
Leishmaniasis in endemic areas.
HIV wasting syndrome (seldom the cause of a fever on its own and
seldom results in rapid weight loss).
Remember that immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may
present with fever after ART is started (see below). Non-infective
causes of fever to consider are DVT and drug fever.

Lymphadenopathy
TB.

Syphilis (papulosquamous rash ± recent genital ulcer).
Fungal (histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis).
Malignancy: KS (not necessarily associated with cutaneous KS),
lymphoma.
Dermatological conditions — seborrhoeic dermatitis, chronic
pyoderma.
Local infection that might explain the lymphadenopathy.
Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) of HIV itself is common.
It is defined as follows:
1. >3 separate lymph node groups affected.
2. At least 2 nodes >1.5 cm in diameter at each site.
3. Duration of >1 month.
4. No local infection that might explain the lymphadenopathy.
It is important to exclude the causes above. If nodes are rapidly
enlarging or assymetrical or there are systemic signs, a lymph node
must be biopsied to exclude TB, lymphoma, KS, and fungal infection.

Wasting syndrome and malnutrition
Documenting weight loss is essential — clinical impressions are often
wrong, so weigh all patients at every outpatient visit and record the
weight in a prominent place in the case notes. Causes of weight loss
include poor diet (loss of income), chronic infections such as TB, and
chronic diarrhoea. Poor appetite is less commonly recognized as
remediable and there is often an iatrogenic contribution (iron tablets,
multiple courses of unnecessary antibiotics such as erythromycin and
metronidazole, and even milk-based nutritional supplements in
individuals with lactose intolerance).

Nutrition:
Nutritional advice is anxiously sought after, and freely given by health
care workers. Unfortunately, the evidence base for much of this advice

is scanty and it is often inappropriate to the socio-economic status of
the patient. Finding malnutrition should prompt a vigorous search for
its cause — usually TB or chronic diarrhoea (or both). Treat the cause
and, if appropriate and feasible, consider starting ART. Affordable
local diets with sufficient protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and trace
elements are part of the holistic management of all malnourished
patients. In patients who are not malnourished, there is no convincing
evidence that changing diet is clinically beneficial.

Multivitamins:
Patients who are malnourished or clinically hypovitaminotic will
benefit from replacement therapy. Most multivitamin preparations
contain only recommended daily allowances of vitamins and are thus
inappropriate for the correction of severe deficiencies — use single
agents in appropriate doses e.g. nicotinamide for pellagra, thiamine
for beri-beri, ascorbic acid for scurvy (doses see Chapter 17). If the
individual components are unavailable, it may be necessary to treat by
giving 10 or more multivitamin tablets daily, which is safe as long as
the product contains only water-soluble vitamins in RDA quantities. In
adult patients who are neither malnourished nor hypovitaminotic,
supplemental vitamins are of unclear value. However, mild
hypovitaminosis is difficult to exclude clinically, and so it is reasonable
to consider widespread supplementation in the hope that it may retard
disease progression.

Nutritional supplements and drug interactions:
The number of medications given to individuals on ART creates
considerable potential for drug interactions; throwing nutritional and
herbal supplements into the mix may complicate matters further. The
simplest advice for individuals on ART is to avoid nutritional
supplements unless these are clearly innocuous. Relatively welldocumented interactions are between St John's Wort and protease
inhibitors and nevirapine, and garlic supplements in patients on
saquinavir. Other potential difficulties concern alteration in absorption
— antacid containing medications and didanosine, and all ART and
activated charcoal, which is sometimes sold as a ‘detoxifier’.

Skin and oral disease
Herpes zoster
A vesicular eruption typically in a dermatomal distribution. If started
within 72 h of the onset of blistering, aciclovir (800 mg 5× daily for 7 d)
or valaciclovir (1 g tds for 7 d) may shorten duration and d risk of post
herpetic neuralgia. Zoster involving the eye should be treated with
topical aciclovir ophthalmic ointment — if possible, refer to
ophthalmologist. Give analgesia e.g. paracetamol 1 g qds ±
amitriptyline 10-25 mg nocte; occasionally opiates may be required.

Itchy rashes
Pruritic rashes are common. Consider treating for scabies even if
distribution not typical as treatment is cheap and safe. Drug reactions
are also common (see below) but in the absence of a clear drug
aetiology, generalized itchy, fine, papular eruptions may be due to the
so-called papular dermatitis of HIV (‘itchy bump disease’.) This may
respond to topical 0.1% betamethasone (1% hydrocortisone for the
face.)

Crusted (Norwegian) scabies
A severe, hyperkeratotic form of scabies seen in immunocompromised
persons. There is extensive crusting in areas accessible to scratching,
with sparing of areas less easily reached, such as the middle of the
back; the scalp is usually involved. Treatment —see
p 545.

Drug rashes
Drug rashes vary from mild papular eruptions to Stevens-Johnson
syndrome. Common causes include co-trimoxazole, anti-TB drugs,
phenytoin, carbamazepine, and NNRTIs, but practically any drug can
be involved. Check carefully for the presence of fever, new
adenopathy, facial swelling, mucosal involvement, eosinophilia, or
raised liver enzymes. The presence of one or more of these features is

an absolute indication to stop all therapy. Do not be tempted to use
drugs to treat a drug-induced skin disease — once the drug is stopped it
will improve with time and supportive measures. In patients with only
mild reactions (none of the above danger signs present), it may be
reasonable to consider continuing ‘essential’ drugs (e.g. NNRTIs, cotrimoxazole) under close supervision.

Gingivostomatitis
This may be due to Candida or Herpes simplex (Chapter 16). Major
aphthous ulceration is a disabling polymicrobial gingivostomatitis with
extensive ulceration and necrosis. Consider topical therapy (e.g.
povidone iodine mouthwashes) and oral amoxicillin plus
metronidazole; in refractory cases with persistent ulceration, biopsy to
exclude TB and syphilis. Persistent symptoms without an easily
identifiable cause are an indication for considering antiretroviral
therapy if this is available. In its absence, judicious corticosteroid use
may induce a modest response.

Vaginal candidiasis
See Chapter 16

Respiratory disease
Community acquired pneumonia
Presentation is usually acute (hours to days) with fever, pleuritic chest
pain, and cough → purulent sputum. Clinical signs may be fewer with ↓
immunity, making diagnosis more difficult; classical lobar consolidation
becomes less common. The differential diagnosis includes atypical TB
or PCP. Therapy should be guided by local medication availability and
resistance patterns but, in general, ill immunosuppressed patients
should be treated with a parenteral agent with good gram-positive
cover, such as a third generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone 1 g
od) or, if not available, ampicillin 1 g 6 hourly. If there is poor response
within 48 h, add doxycycline 100 mg od and intensify the search for TB.
Parenteral therapy can be changed to oral once there is clinical

response.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)
Symptoms of dry cough and increasing dyspnoea have usually been
present for days to a week or longer. There are usually few signs in the
presence of quite marked hypoxia (cyanosis and tachypoea). CXR shows
a diffuse interstitial infiltrate without effusion or adenopathy. Sputum
induced by 10 minutes of nebulization with hypertonic saline may be
positive on microscopy and, in dedicated hands, this procedure is as
successful as bronchoscopy and lavage. Therapy is usually initiated on
clinical and radiographic grounds in the absence of laboratory
confirmation. Treatment is with co-trimoxazole
(trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole 80/400 mg) 4 tablets qds for 21 days
(if <60 kg — the majority of adult patients — reduce to 3 tablets tds;
see
p. 120 for paediatric doses); ↑ K+ and ↑ creatinine are
recognized side-effects. If hypoxic, consider adding prednisone (40 mg
bd for 5 days; then 40 mg od for 5 days; then 20 mg od for 10 days).
Response is not always very dramatic and some patients may take > a
week to start to settle. After treatment, give 2° prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole 80/400 2 tablets od (adult dose; may be reduced to 1
tablet od to improve tolerance).

Chronic cough
When associated with weight loss and other respiratory symptoms,
chronic cough should prompt a search for an underlying chest
infection, usually TB. The differential is quite wide in the absence of
other systemic features and should include extrinsic bronchial
compression from lymphadenopathy (TB, lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma)
and parenchymal lung diseases presenting atypically, without major
clinical or radiological manifestations (e.g. pneumocystis and
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP)). Pulmonary KS is an
important although uncommon possibility, typically presenting with
nodular opacities with hilar adenopathy with pleural effusion that may
be confused with pulmonary TB. Look carefully for evidence of skin or
oral Kaposi lesions which are often, although not invariably, present.
Remember that HIV-infected people can also suffer from all the

diseases of HIV-negative patients, so consider late onset asthma, drug
side-effects (e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) and foreign
bodies.

Gastrointestinal disease
Gastroenteritis
Try the mnemonic: ‘HERS’ is more acute — Hydration, Electrolyte
Replacement, and consider Septicaemia; HIS is chronic — History,
Investigations, and Start ART if possible.
When history short, or in acute deterioration, determine hydration

status (pulse and blood pressure lying and sitting, urine-specific
gravity, and laboratory measurement of K+, Na+, urea, and creatinine
concentrations). Signs of dehydration can be misleading in marasmus
as patients commonly have sunken eyes and reduced skin turgor. If
sufficiently dehydrated to require IV therapy, give 5% dextrose-saline,
1 litre 4-6 hourly adjusted according to clinical response. As most
patients are hypokalaemic, start replacement with IV K+ 20-40 mmol in
each litre, unless the patient is anuric at presentation, in which case
wait for a laboratory K+ result. Oral K+ may exacerbate nausea and
vomiting. In febrile patients who have colitis (bloody diarrhoea with
abdominal tenderness on palpation over the colon) or who do not
respond to fluid resuscitation, gram-negative septicaemia is a
possibility; consider either a quinolone or a third generation
cephalosporin with activity against Salmonella and Shigella. If
possible, take blood for culture before giving antibiotics.

Chronic diarrhoea
Diarrhoea can wax and wane, creating the illusion of response to
symptomatic therapy and antibiotic cocktails. A review of weight
charts usually reveals a trend. Enquire about milk and dairy intake, as
occasional patients develop lactose intolerance.
Investigation: stool microscopy (looking for ova and parasites) and
culture, ± C. difficile toxin. The majority of organisms identified (e.g.
cryptosporidium) respond poorly if at all to specific medical therapy,
and the general approach should be to assess for ART, as improvement
in immunity usually cures the diarrhoea. Isosporiasis may respond to
co-trimoxazole 80/400 two tablets qds for 3 weeks. There is also
limited evidence for the efficacy of albendazole 400 mg bd for a month
in patients with microsporidium. Home-based safe water systems
(plastic container, chlorine tablets) may help reduce episodes of
diarrhoea in counties without safe water supplies. Consider
gastrointestinal TB and treat as appropriate.

Abdominal pain
In HIV-infected people, acute abdominal pain often presents a

diagnostic dilemma. The usual differential of an acute abdomen is
applicable, and the recovery rate after surgery is similar to that of
HIV-uninfected people. Also consider:
Salmonella typhi and its complications.
Abdominal TB (often but not always associated with ascites and
retroperitoneal adenopathy. The finding of splenic hypodensities on
ultrasound is strongly suggestive of this condition.)
CMV infection is often associated with vasculitis and episodic severe
pain. Negative IgG CMV serology makes the diagnosis less likely.
Herbal enema usage.
‘Pus anywhere’ — subphrenic abscess, PID-associated pelvic
collections, psoas abscess.
Neuropathic pain — zoster without the rash yet (it appears the next
day, or may never develop but dermatomal distribution is
suggestive).
Gastritis related to medication.
Pyelonephritis and cystitis (check the urine).
Pancreatitis (due to CMV, TB, or drugs e.g. co-trimoxazole, D4T, DDI,
and possibly 3TC).

Odynophagia and dysphagia
Oral causes:
Candida infection is the usual cause; apart from the usual white
plaques it can also present as ulceration, erythema, and circumoral
dermatitis or angular cheilitis. Topical antifungals are usually effective
— e.g. nystatin 100,000 units swirled around in the mouth every 6 h for
a week. Other choices include clotrimazole or amphotericin lozenges.
Major aphthous ulceration (see
p 83) may be due to polymicrobial
bacterial infection and is sometimes associated with perineal disease.
Herpetic ulcers (due to Herpes simplex virus) have a typical clinical

appearance and are usually self-limiting; aciclovir 400 mg 5x daiily or
valaciclovir 500 mg bd for 5 days may help; analgesia important.

Oesophageal causes:
Pain or discomfort localized to the chest or lower neck is more likely
due to an oesophageal cause. Candida is the most common cause and
is most confidently diagnosed in the presence of associated oral
plaques, although it can sometimes be present without this. This
requires systemic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg PO od for 10-14
days. Ketoconazole is a cheaper alternative (200 mg/day) but is an
enzyme inhibitor that reduces cortisol synthesis and may precipitate
adrenal crisis; its absorption is also erratic in hypochlorhydric patients.
Severe discomfort may make swallowing tablets impossible,
necessitating parenteral treatment with amphotericin 0.5-1 mg/kg/day
IV for 7 days (IV fluconazole is an alternative). If no visible thrush or
no response to systemic anti-fungal therapy (fluconazole for 3 weeks),
then oesophagoscopy is usually indicated, and may establish a
diagnosis of CMV or herpes oesophagitis.

Perianal pathology
Perianal pathology is often very painful. Apart from Candida infection,
non-specific painful ulceration is common. Consider STIs and check
syphilis serology. Investigations depend on individual clinical
presentation and available resources. Consider early treatment with
specific therapy for herpes infection (e.g. aciclovir or valaciclovir) or a
trial of antibiotics which include anaerobic cover (e.g. co-amoxiclav)
for particularly infected looking lesions. Results of superficial pus
swabs are seldom informative. In refractory cases or if there is
evidence of fistula formation, a biopsy may reveal treatable disease
e.g. TB. Topical therapies for pain are usually available, but vary and
are seldom evidence-based.

Liver disease
Asymptomatic liver enzyme rises are quite common in HIV-infected
people, often reflecting systemic illness or drug reactions. Minor rises

of transaminases with drug therapy (e.g. anti-tuberculous medication)
in an asymptomatic patient should be managed by repetition of the
test a week later; if there is no clear trend to increase, then continue
therapy. Elevation of transaminases >4× normal, or if there are signs of
acute liver disease, should be managed as acute hepatitis.

Acute hepatitis
This is commonly due to hepatitis B infection, although CMV, herpes
simplex, and hepatitis A are sometimes responsible. Hepatitis B
morbidity and mortality may be greater in patients co-infected with
HIV, but it is unclear if there is a more rapid progression to AIDS.
Patients started on ART may also develop an immune reconstitution
response to quiescent viral hepatitis, which is theoretically partially
ameliorated by using drugs with activity against hepatitis B and C (e.g.
3TC.) Unfortunately, hepatitis B resistance to antiviral monotherapy
develops rapidly. An ART combination containing both tenofovir and
3TC is preferable in HBV co-infected patients.

Drug-induced hepatitis
Common causes are TB drugs and ART, but almost any drug can be
responsible. Principles of management are early recognition (also
consider hepatitis B or C flare as part of IRIS); assessment of severity;
and evaluation of the importance of the drug to the patient's
treatment. Because the recognition of drug-induced hepatitis is often
delayed, patients often present with severe liver dysfunction, and it is
usually advisable to stop all medication initially — especially if liver
enzyme rise is >5X upper limit of normal, or if there is fever, ↑ WCC, or
an associated rash. ddI, d4T, and nevirapine are particularly well
associated with hepatitis, so once the patient has settled clinically and
biochemically, regimens that avoid these agents should be considered.

HIV cholangiopathy
Patients with late-stage HIV disease may develop right upper quadrant
discomfort and an obstructive LFT profile. In the absence of gallstones
(ultrasound), low-grade cholangitis should be considered; this may

progress to resemble sclerosing cholangitis on ERCP. A wide range of
potential pathogens (e.g. salmonella, toxoplasma, CMV, and
cryptosporidium) have been implicated, but response to specific
therapy is generally poor. Consider ART.

Hepatomegaly
cardiac causes (cardiomyopathies, pericardial disease).
infections, viral and TB, malaria, leishmaniasis.
infiltrates (e.g. lymphoma).
medication-associated steatohepatitis and malnutrition.

Cardiac disease

P.90

HIV-associated cardiomyopathy
This is usually due to HIV per se but cardiotropic viruses and
opportunistic infections may also be implicated. Cardiac histology
shows a myocarditis. It is important to exclude alternative (e.g.
nutritional) causes. It typically presents with dilated cardiomyopathy
and heart failure and a CD4 count <100/mm3. There are case reports of
improvement in myocardial function with ART. Associated cardiac
failure should be treated.

Pericardial disease
Pericardial effusions may be tuberculous, bacterial, fungal, malignant
(Kaposi, lymphoma), or idiopathic. In high-incidence TB settings in
Africa, 86-100% of pericardial effusions in HIV-infected people are
tuberculous. Diagnosis is confirmed by cardiac ultrasound ±
pericardiocentesis. A presumptive diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis
may be made without pericardiocentesis in high-incidence settings
and/or in patients in whom there is a high clinical suspicion of TB.
Pericardiocentesis is, however, indicated in patients who present
septic (to exclude pyogenic infection) and in cardiac tamponade.

Vascular disease
Vasculitis of the aorta and its large branches giving rise to narrowing.
Aneurysmal dilatation is rare but well described in HIV. Pulmonary
hypertension is more common and generally carries a poor prognosis.
The incidence of coronary artery disease is increased in patients on
protease inhibitors due to their adverse effect on lipid and glucose
metabolism.

Renal disease
Acute renal failure due to sepsis and/or dehydration is common in
patients with opportunistic infections; renal function usually
normalizes with appropriate treatment and rehydration but may take
1-2 weeks following acute tubular necrosis and temporary dialysis may
be required.

HIV-associated nephropathy
HIV-associated nephropathy manifests initially with proteinuria which
may evolve to nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal dysfunction
evolving to endstage renal failure over several months. Patients are
typically not oedematous nor hypertensive because the condition is
saltwasting. Histology shows focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
as well as tubular disease. The pathology results from direct infection
of renal endothelial cells by HIV. Treatment includes ACE inhibitors
and ART. ART may stabilize or improve milder cases but, if patients
have lost significant renal function, the condition progresses despite
ART.
Other forms of glomerulonephritis, such as post-infectious, may also
occur in HIV-infected individuals. Thus, it is always preferable to
confirm the diagnosis with renal biopsy if available. An immune
complex mediated nephritis, distinct from FSGS, has been described in
association with HIV.

Neurological disease

P.92

Chronic headache
Chronic headache should always be taken seriously in HIV-infected
people. Fever and meningeal irritation may be absent in lymphocytic
meningitides, and frontal lobe mass lesions may have little in the way
of lateralizing signs until late. Consider:
Common chronic meningitides (TB, cryptococcosis, syphilis).
Sinusitis ± subdural empyema.
Space-occupying lesions (toxoplasmosis, tuberculoma, lymphoma).
Drugs (co-trimoxazole can rarely → sterile meningitis; zidovudine
and efavirenz cause various CNS symptoms, including headache).

Meningitis
Any patient with HIV and a new headache or unexplained fever should
be considered to have meningitis. Signs of meningism may not be
present so absence of neck stiffness does NOT exclude the diagnosis.
The variability in physical signs and CSF findings reflect the degree of
immunocompromise and pattern of the associated meningeal process.

Cryptococcal meningitis
This is due to infection by the capsulate yeast, Cryptococcus
neoformans, which is carried by birds (especially pigeons) and excreted
in avian faeces. Infection follows inhalation of the yeast, and in
immunocompetent individuals is asymptomatic or accompanied by
mild self-limiting respiratory symptoms. Although meningeal infection
may rarely occur in the immunocompetent, it is much more common
in immunosuppressed individuals, particularly those with HIV. Rarely
disseminated cryptococcosis may occur, involving almost any organ
including skin, mucosae, and bones.

Clinical features of cryptococcal:
meningitis are usually insidious in onset, with headache, malaise, lowgrade fever, ± altered mental state.

Diagnosis:
There are often few cells in the CSF but India ink staining of CSF
usually shows characteristic capsulated yeast cells (capsule appears as
a clear halo around the yeast). The cryptococcal latex agglutination
test (CLAT) is highly sensitive and specific for both blood and CSF.

Treatment:
is for life unless immunity is restored with ART and consists of an
initial intensive phase followed by long-term low-dose maintenance
(so-called secondary prophylaxis). Give:
Amphotericin B (amB, 0.7-1 mg/kg/day diluted in 200 ml 5% dextrose
water and infused over four hours) for 10 days. Test doses are
unnecessary and the addition of heparin and antihistamines adds
little: severe allergic reactions in amphotericin-naïve patients are
rare. AmB is best avoided in renal failure and attention should be
given to adequate hydration (consider IV fluids). Monitor K+ as lifethreatening hypokalaemia is relatively common.
Following 10 days' treatment with amphotericin, give fluconazole
400 mg od for 2 months. (In patients who are very well, it is
reasonable to dispense with the amphotericin and proceed directly
to the fluconazole 400 mg/d for two months, but the evidence from
head-to-head trials that this is equivalent to initial amphotericin is
scanty.)
Thereafter, continue for life with fluconazole 200 mg per day.
In patients with ongoing headache or drowsiness, consider repeat LP
with CSF manometry: if pressure >30 cm CSF, remove sufficient CSF
to reduce to <20 cm CSF. This often leads to quite dramatic
symptomatic relief but may need to be repeated if symptoms recur.

Space-occupying lesions (SOL)
Brain SOLs present with one or more of headaches, focal neurological
signs, or fits (
p 432). Careful neurological examination for focal
signs and signs of ↑ICP is essential. Frontal lobe lesions may cause
personality changes. Brain imaging (CT or MRI) and biopsy may help
diagnosis, but in their absence diagnosis and management relies on
judgements about the most probable cause, presence of associated
disease elsewhere, and response to therapy. The most common finding
on brain imaging is a contrast enhancing mass lesion with surrounding
oedema. Multiple lesions in a patient with a CD4 count <50 are likely to
be due to toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is less likely if the CD4 count is
higher (>150), toxoplasma IgG is -ve, or patient is on co-trimoxazole
prophylaxis. Single lesions with considerable basal contrast
enhancement and an abnormal CXR (particularly hilar adenopathy, a
chronic lower zone infiltrate, or a miliary pattern) suggest TB. Other
causes include primary CNS lymphoma (rare), pyogenic brain abscess,
cryptococcoma, and syphilis; consider neurocysticercosis in endemic
areas.

Management:
Where facilities allow, diagnosis treatment should be based on specific
investigations including serology, imaging, CSF examination, and brain
biopsy. In the absence of a specific diagnosis, the following is a
pragmatic approach to management:
If evidence of TB elsewhere (LNs, CXR, abdominal USS looking for
splenic hypodensities or adenopathy), treat for TB initially.
In the absence of features suggesting TB, treat for toxoplasmosis
initially, as therapy is less arduous and response can be assessed
within a week. (It is advisable not to give corticosteroids for focal
cerebral oedema unless they are considered to be life-saving, as
they will cause many patients to appear to respond both clinically
and radiologically.)
If there is no response to treatment for toxoplasmosis within 2
weeks, and no other diagnostic pointers, it is common practice to

then commence on therapy for TB, although where there is access to
a neurosurgical service, consultation with a view to biopsy is
desirable.
In patients who respond partially, there is no simple answer. In
general, it is usually preferable to treat for TB as well, but the
previously listed differential diagnosis should be re-scrutinized at
this stage.

Seizures
Causes include those common to HIV-uninfected people, but the high
incidence of organic CNS pathology in HIV means careful attention
should be given to the exclusion of SOLs and chronic meningitides. In
patients with very low CD4 counts, HIV encephalopathy may itself
cause seizures. Management of patients with seizures who require
antiepileptics presents a few specific issues. Firstly, conventional
antiepileptic doses need adjusting according to the reduced weight of
many patients, bearing in mind that the liver induction due to other
medications may counterbalance this. In patients in whom ART is being
contemplated, the drug interactions with phenytoin and
carbamazepine can be problematic and a switch to valproate is often
justified, particularly if prescribers are unfamiliar with the magnitude
and direction of the interactions.

Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasma gondii
is an obligate intracellular parasite. Cats are the definitive host.
Transmission occurs by ingestion of food contaminated by oocytes from
cat faeces or tissue cysts in undercooked meat from domesticated
animals. Infection is common and usually asymptomatic in
immunocompetent adults, but may cause a mononucleosis-like
syndrome. Primary infection of women in the early stages of pregnancy
results in foetal infection and serious congenital malformations. Latent
infection may become reactivated in immunocompromised patients,
causing severe disease involving lungs, heart, and chorioretina.

Cerebral toxoplasmosis is a common manifestation in HIV/AIDS.

Clinical features:
of cerebral toxoplasmosis include headache, focal neurological signs,
altered mental state, and coma. Diffuse cerebral involvement presents
with generalized CNS dysfunction without focal signs. Toxoplasma
pneumonitis manifests as fever with cough and dyspnoea;
chorioretinitis is uncommon.

Diagnosis:
of cerebral toxoplasmosis is clinical, supported by serology and brain
imaging (MRI or CT). Typically, it presents with multiple ring enhancing
brain lesions on CT; CD4 count is usually <50 and toxoplasma IgG +ve.
Brain biopsy may be helpful in atypical presentations.

Management
Conventional therapy is with pyrimethamine plus sulphadiazine (or
clindamycin) for 6 weeks. Bone marrow suppression occurs with
pyrimethamine (a folate antagonist), so folinic acid is also given:
Pyrimethamine 200 mg PO loading dose, 50-75 mg PO od, plus
Folinic acid 10 mg od (pyrimethamine is a folate antagonist), plus
either Sulfadiazine 1-1.5 g PO qds
or Clindamycin 600 mg PO qds.
Maintenance therapy should then continue for life with pyrimethamine
25-50 mg PO od plus sulfadiazine 0.5-1 g qds od.

Alternative regimen
The above regimen is both difficult to obtain and expensive and there
is preliminary evidence that single-strength co-trimoxazole 80/400 four
tablets bd for 4 weeks, followed by two tablets bd for 3 months, is
adequate. Secondary prophylaxis after that should continue for life (or
until immune reconstitution on ART) with two tablets od. Not all

patients treated with co-trimoxazole will demonstrate a complete
clinical response, particularly if there is an associated infarct.

HIV-associated dementia
HIV-associated dementia is a slow onset process characterized by
motor apraxia and mental slowing with forgetfulness. It is important to
identify it early as it is an indication for consideration for ART: they
can arrest the process and may even reverse some of the changes.
Standard mini-mental tests are designed to screen for the
predominantly cortical lesions of Alzheimer's disease, so alternative
screening tools that also evaluate subcortical function have been
proposed. One scale (see table below) has been cross-culturally
validated to some extent and consists of three components — a
memory test, a psychomotor component, and a motor component.
Sensitivity is ~80%, specificity 55-57%.

HIV encephalopathy and progressive multifocal

leukoencephalopathy
HIV is a neurotropic virus that can cause a slowly progressive (months)
dementing illness characterized by forgetfulness and minor motor
apraxias. Vacuolar myelopathy is a variant where the cortical changes
are preceded by a progressive spastic weakness. Always exclude
Vitamin B12 deficiency in the latter. Progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a white matter illness due to JC virus
infection which presents with lateralizing
neurology, and speech and cognition difficulties. ART is always worth
attempting in dementing patients who have adequate home resources
to ensure adherence. A response in PML less often occurs.

Psychosis
Common causes include acute situational stressors (reactions to
learning HIV status, often in the face of inadequate counselling),
opportunistic CNS infections (chronic meningitides, frontal space
occupying lesions), severe opportunistic infections elsewhere,
metabolic disorders (hyponatraemia, dehydration, and uraemia) and
medications (e.g. efavirenz). Thiamine and niacin deficiencies are
seldom considered and well worth treating empirically even if merely
suspected (see Chapter 17). Vitamin B12 deficiency is another potential
cause for abnormal mentation.
Use of neuroleptic agents in frail, thin HIV-positive patients should be
cautious — often tiny doses (e.g. haloperidol 0.5 mg bd) may be quite
adequate.

Stroke
The abrupt onset of focal neurological signs is a devastating event for
young HIV-infected persons, particularly if the resultant disability
impacts on activities of daily living and the ability to look after
children. A proactive approach looking at modifiable risk factors is
essential. Causes:
Blood.
Hyperviscosity.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Antiphospholipid antibody syndromes.
Acquired protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiency.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Blood pressure — hypertension (e.g. due to HIV nephropathy) or
hypotension (septicaemia, dehydration).
Embolic — infective endocarditis related either to previous
rheumatic heart disease or IV drug use.
Vessel wall.
Infective vasculitis (meningitis — TB, syphilis, cryptococcal, CMV,
herpes zoster, and even toxoplasmosis).
Autoimmune vasculitis.
Haemorrhage (mycotic aneurysm, intracerebral Kaposi).
HIV vasculopathy is considered possible but is poorly
characterized.

Diagnosis:
look for clinical signs of embolic source; FBC, blood film, U&E, ESR, or
CRP, syphilis serology, total serum protein (?hyperviscosity), ±
thrombophilia screen (PT, anticardiolipin antibodies, protein C,
protein S, and antithrombin III levels); brain imaging (CT or MRI).

Management
involves treatment of any identified underlying cause and counselling
about the condition and expected prognosis, attention to nutrition
(able to swallow, adequate hydration plan?), and urine and bowel care
plans (decisions about catheter versus nappies/linen savers if
incontinent.) In the absence of any identified remediable cause, it is
common practice to give aspirin 75-150 mg od as secondary
prophylaxis, although evidence of benefit in this patient population
has not been established.

Peripheral neuropathy
Consider HIV neuropathy, medication (INH, stavudine, didanosine),
CMV (initial perineal pain, associated CSF polymorph rise), nutritional
deficiencies (thiamine, niacin, pyridoxine, vitamin B12), and vasculitic
neuropathy (stepwise progression.)
Acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies
(Guillain-Barre syndrome) present in the same way as in HIV-uninfected
people, and a few cells in the CSF should not exclude the diagnosis if
the clinical picture is correct. Steroids are often given in the chronic
form but, as with the acute form, are probably of little value, and in
patients with the asymmetrical pure motor form may in fact do harm.

Mononeuropathies
The most common mononeuropathy is an isolated VIIth (Bell's palsy),
but practically any cranial nerve can be involved. The natural history
of a Bell's palsy is similar to that in HIV-uninfected people, with lack of
clear evidence of benefit from either antivirals (e.g. aciclovir) or
steroids. The importance is recognizing the lower motor neurone
nature of the lesion, which makes intracranial pathology unlikely.

Paraparesis
Patients with weak legs can have any of the causes of peripheral
neuropathy; also consider intrinsic cord disease if upper motor neurone
signs are present. TB and syphilitic myeloradiculitis are sometimes
associated with dermatomal pain at the level of the lesion, and CMV
infection may classically present with lumbosacral pain.

Depression
Depression in HIV-infected people is under-recognized. It may be
situational or due to medication, intercurrent illness, or organic brain
disease. Depressed people adjust poorly to new disease and
therapeutic challenges, and adherence may be affected.
Antidepressant medication and protease inhibitors may interact;

interactions with NNRTIs are rare.

Eye disease
HIV retinopathy is usually aymptomatic, although minor visual
symptoms may occur. Soft exudates without haemorrhage are seen.
CMV infection of the eye yields a characteristic ophthalmoscopic
appearance and can be managed relatively simply by intraocular
gancyclovir injections under the supervision of an ophthalmologist.
Acute retinal necrosis is a condition characterized by rapid, initially
peripheral retinal damage thought to be due to HSV (sometimes
CMV) infection. Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is
appropriate.
Toxoplasmosis causes largish, yellow-white exudates, usually without
haemorrhage. It may be a feature of more generalized disease, and
therapy is the same as for the encephalitic form.

HIV-related malignancy

P.100

Kaposi sarcoma (KS)
This is a tumour of lymphatic endothelial cells, caused by the Kaposi
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also known as human
herpesvirus-8, HHV-8), that presents with lesions of the skin, oral
cavity, and, in some cases, the viscera. The incidence of KS in HIVinfected populations is closely related to background prevalence of
KSHV and is very common in west Africa.

Clinical features:
KS typically presents as single or multiple lesions that are papular or
nodular and pigmented, appearing black on black skin and purple on
pale skin. Early lesions, being small and macular, are often difficult to
recognize. While mostly asymptomatic, the lesions may become
painful or ulcerate. They occur on all parts of the body, not just the
skin, and are rarely limited to one anatomical region. Lesions on the

face, legs, and in the mouth are common. Visceral disease may occur
without skin involvement: the only visible lesion may be in the mouth.
Oral lesions are often not raised and are usually asymptomatic but may
result in bleeding, pain, and dysphagia. KS commonly involves lymph
nodes (producing lymphoedema), the GI tract (can result in bleeding
and anaemia), and the lungs (dyspnoea, cough). Patients with
extensive KS may have B-symptoms such as weight loss and fever.

Diagnosis:
clinical in most cases; a punch biopsy otherwise shows characteristic
histology. Pulmonary involvement gives rise to characteristic CXR
changes (flame-shaped linear and nodular infiltrates spreading from
the hila) and may be accompanied by a blood-stained pleural effusion.
GIT and pulmonary involvement is confirmed on endoscopy.

Management:
ART is the first line of therapy. Limited skin and oral disease may
regress with ART alone. If there is progression on ART, chemotherapy is
considered. Patients with visceral involvement or extensive disease
(>25 lesions, lymphoedema) usually require ART plus chemotherapy
from the start. The common regimen used in resource-limited settings
consists of combinations of doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vincristine.
Local treatment such as radiation or topical liquid nitrogen can be
used for localized lesions.

Lymphoma
Common forms in HIV-infected people:
Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).
Primary CNS lymphoma.
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL).
NHL is 200-600 times more common than in the general population and
is usually related to underlying oncogenic EBV infection. Lymphomas
typically present with chronic symptoms including wasting, fever, and

symptoms related to location of disease. Patients may have
adenopathy and/or GIT, hepatic, pulmonary, bone marrow, and CNS
involvement. Diagnosis is confirmed by lymph node excision biopsy,
bone marrow biopsy, or biopsy of other involved organs. Immunoblastic
or Burkitt's lymphoma are the most common histologies. Most are B
cell in origin.

Management:
Combination chemotherapy (e.g. CHOP — cyclophosphamide,
adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone); ART prevents relapses.

Primary CNS lymphoma
causes focal signs and SOLs on CT and is EBV related: a positive EBV
PCR in CSF supports diagnosis. Prognosis is poor even with
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and ART.

PEL
presents with lymphomatous serous effusions in the absence of mass
lesions. It is related to KSHV. It is diagnosed by pleural biopsy.
Treatment is with chemotherapy and ART.

Cervical cancer
HIV infection in women is associated with a higher rate of cervical
squamous intra-epithelial neoplasia (SIN) and a modest increase in the
risk of cervical cancer. This is closely related to infection with certain
oncogenic types of HPV. Invasive cervical carcinoma is a WHO stage 4
condition. Women with HIV should be screened annually with Pap
smears. If high-grade SIN is present, then colposcopy and biopsy is
indicated. Cervical cancer is treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy.

Preparing patients for ART

P.104

Prior to ART being commenced, the patient should be medically and
psychosocially prepared. The following issues need to be addressed:
Screen for opportunistic infections: ask about chronic cough (>2
weeks), night sweats, and recent weight loss — if any of these
present, investigate for TB. Ask about visual disturbances — if
present, screen for CMV. Screen for peripheral neuropathy
(symptoms and signs). Use the WHO clinical staging system to classify
each patient (
p 72). Treatment for all active OI should be
initiated before starting ART and patients should be on appropriate
primary and secondary prophylaxis.
Baseline blood tests: depending on availability, these should include:
FBC, LFTs (ALT is a useful screen), creatinine, CD4 count, HIV viral
load, VDRL, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody.
Potential drug interactions: ensure no significant drug interactions
between drugs the patient is taking and the ART to be started.
Adjustments of medication or doses may be required.
The following issues should be addressed in counselling before a
patient commences ART:
HIV transmission and disease progression.
Safe sex and other prevention messages (provide condoms).
Understanding of CD4 count (and viral load if available).
Benefits of therapy (treatment is NOT a cure).
Side-effects and monitoring of treatment.
Adherence and resistance.
Family disclosure.
Integrating treatment into daily life.

Drug interactions (including alternative therapies).
Dealing with complications.

Other issues
Substance abuse should be addressed (counselling and referral). It is
preferable that patients abstain before ART is started.
Depression should also be treated before staring ART (counselling ±
antidepressants).
Patients with food shortages should be referred for appropriate
support if this is available.

Disclosure of HIV status:
patients should be encouraged to disclose their status to sexual
partners and household members. Non-disclosure compromises
adherence. If possible, patients should bring in a treatment supporter
(friend, partner, or family member) who can also be educated about
HIV and ART and remind and motivate the patient about their therapy.
Other adherence tools include alarms, pillboxes, tick sheets, and
reminders sent by mobile phone.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART)

P.106

Antiretroviral drugs act by inhibiting various steps in the replication
cycle of HIV. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NNRTI) and the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transciptase inhibitors
(NRTI/NtRTI) inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase, whereas
protease inhibitors inhibit the viral enzyme protease. It is standard
practice to combine ≥3 antiretroviral drugs into a regimen sufficiently
potent to inhibit all viral replication and thereby prevent the
emergence of resistant mutants — this is known as highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART or ART).
With ART, it is possible to suppress the viral load below the limit of
detection (usually <50 copies/ml) for years, provided patients adhere
correctly. This allows for the CD4 to recover — on average 75

cells/mm3 in the 1st month and 75 cells/mm3 per year thereafter. With
the rise in CD4 count, patients experience immune restoration.
Opportunistic infections occur with reduced incidence, some OI regress
without specific therapy (e.g. cryptosporidium), and patients are
generally able to stop preventative therapies when CD4 counts rise
>200 cells/mm3. This results in reduced progression to AIDS,
improvement in quality of life, and prolonged survival.
Treatment is lifelong, and correct adherence with therapy is critical.
Patients taking ART should be adequately counselled before starting
therapy. Patients need to have full insight into their disease, the drugs,
the need for strict adherence, the side-effects, and prevention. Missing
doses leads to inadequate viral suppression that results in the selection
of mutations in the virus that confer resistance to the drugs. This
causes sequential loss of drugs in a regimen due to the development of
resistance, and patients require a change of regimen to attain viral
suppression again. Over time, it is possible for patients to develop
resistance to all classes of antiretrovirals making viral suppression
impossible (multi-drug resistant HIV).

Starting therapy
The WHO recommendations regarding when to start ART differ
according to whether CD4 counts are available or not (see opposite). In
general all patients with clinically advanced disease and/or CD4 <200
require ART initiation. AIDS-defining illnesses (except TB) are
uncommon with a CD4 count >200/mm3 whole blood.
In addition to the medical criteria, patients must be psychosocially
ready to commence lifelong daily therapy. This involves addressing
issues such as substance abuse, depression, disclosure, and family
relationships before starting. It is also useful for the patient to have a
treatment supporter from their household or a friend who can
motivate and remind.

First-line therapy
First-line therapy involves three drugs (see boxes for abbreviations).
Common choices are one of AZT/D4T/TDF/ABC + one of 3TC/FTC + one
of EFV/NVP. The following simple rules help decide which drug
combination to use:
Avoid D4T in patients with severe pre-existing neuropathy, as D4T
may cause drug-induced neuropathy.
Avoid AZT in patients with anaemia/neutropaenia as AZT bone
marrow suppression is more likely if pre-existing problems.
Avoid TDF in patients with renal dysfunction.
Never use D4T and AZT together as they are antagonistic.
Avoid NVP in patients with underlying liver disease, those with
CD4>250 in women or >400 in men (↑risk of hepatitis) and those on TB
treatment (shared toxicities and drug interactions).
Avoid EFV in women of child-bearing age if there is any risk of
pregnancy (potentially teratogenic). One advantage of EFV is its
compatability with TB therapy, so if it needs to be used in such
women because they are on TB treatment they should be counselled

regarding contraception and switched to NVP on completion of TB
therapy.

Monitoring prior to ART:
If patients do not yet meet the criteria for commencing ART, they
should be followed up and assessed at intervals. The CD4 should be
repeated at 6-12 month intervals. Prior to starting ART, the clinical
staging and/or CD4 count are the best monitors.

Monitoring on ART:
Monitor for — adherence to therapy (e.g. self-reporting, pill counts);
adverse effects (clinically, FBC, LFTs); new opportunistic infections and
IRIS; CD4 and viral load where available. Viral load is the best assay to
monitor therapy. If the viral load is undetectable, CD4 lymphocyte
counts rarely alter management except to guide when to discontinue
prophylaxis for opportunistic infections.

Switching treatment and second-line
therapy

P.110

Treatment failure:
can be virological (virus detected in plasma repeatedly),
immunological (no CD4 response or CD4 decline), and/or clinical (new
WHO stage 3 or 4 events). Consider changing to second-line regimen in
the following settings:
Clinical failure (if CD4 count/viral load not available): development
of new stage 3 or 4 events (excluding TB which may occur at any CD4
count) after 6 months on ART.
Immunological failure (CD4 count but not viral load available): ↓ CD4
count to pre-therapy baseline (or below); or 50% fall from the ontreatment peak value (if known); or persistent CD4 count below 50
cells/mm3 after one year on ART.
Virological failure: where viral loads are available this is the best
guide to the need for switching. Patients should be switched when
viral load is persistently above a certain threshold (e.g. >10,000
copies/ml) despite adequate adherence interventions.

Second-line therapy:
will successfully re-suppress viral replication in the majority of
patients. Second-line therapy includes a protease inhibitor and two
NRTIs (at least one of which has not been used previously). The
decision regarding which regimen to use will depend on what drugs
were used in the first line, available alternatives, and the national
programme, and may need to be discussed with an experienced
physician. It is preferable to use a ‘boosted PI’ regimen in second-line
therapy (see below).

Combining other PIs with a small dose of ritonavir significantly
improves the PI's pharmacokinetic profile, ‘boosting’ its concentration.
‘Boosted PI’ regimens utilize this by combining ritonovir 100 mg bd
with a second PI (e.g. Lopinavir 400 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg bd).

ART side-effects
The majority of patients commencing ART will experience side-effects,
especially in the first few weeks. Most will be mild and resolve
spontaneously e.g. abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting (DDI
and AZT), diarrhoea (PIs), headaches and fatigue (AZT). Warn patients
these may occur. Management then involves excluding serious sideeffects (e.g. hepatitis if nausea or vomiting), reassurance, and
symptomatic therapy (e.g. antiemetic). Other, more serious sideeffects, may also occur however, with potentially lifethreatening/long-term consequences:

Peripheral neuropathy:
Usually due to D4T or DDI. Peripheral sensory neuropathy initially, but
may progress to motor involvement. Patients first complain of pain
and paraesthesia in the feet. Management: Exclude other causes;
amitriptyline 25 mg nocte; consider switching drugs (e.g. D4T to AZT).

Hypersensitivity hepatitis and/or skin rash:
NVP (and less commonly EFV) may cause this, usually within 3 months
of starting treatment. Women, and particularly those with CD4 >250
mm3 are most at risk. Hepatitis may be asymptomatic. In those with ↑
ALT and symptoms, or those asymptomatic but with ALT >200, ART
should be stopped and only recommenced once ALT has normalized —
NVP should then be switched to an alternative drug (e.g. EFV or PI).
The rash is morbiliform or maculopapular but may progress to a
Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If mild, drugs can be continued with close
monitoring. However, if severe (extensive rash, angioedema,
desquamation or blistering, any mucous membrane or systemic
involvement, or associated hepatitis) drugs should be stopped and
recommenced only when the rash has resolved — NVP should again be
switched to EFV or a PI. In the case of life-threatening NVP hepatitis or
rash it is best to avoid EFV in future regimens as cross-reactivity is
described.

Mitochondrial toxicity:
is the underlying mechanism for many NRTI side-effects — neuropathy,
fatty liver, pancreatitis, hyperlacataemia/lactic acidosis.
Combinations of D4T and DDI (the most significant causes) should
therefore be avoided and are contraindicated in pregnancy.

Hyperlactataemia and lactic acidosis:
NRTIs (D4T>DDI>AZT>others) may cause acidosis as a consequence of
mitochondrial toxicity. Severe lactic acidosis carries a high mortality
(>50% in some studies). About a quarter of patients on these drugs will
have a mildly raised lactate and be asymptomatic with no adverse
consequences. Symptomatic hyperlactataemia is heralded by
abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. It usually
occurs after patients have been on ART for several months (median 9
months). In severe lactic acidosis, patients may present in a critical
condition with Kussmaul breathing ± circulatory collapse. Management:
Early detection of hyperlactataemia is critical. Check lactate and ABG

in symptomatic patients. If lactate ↑ (normal venous lactate <2.5
mmol/l) drugs should be stopped and a safer combination started once
lactate has normalized (usually takes 2-3 months); patients who are
acidotic should be admitted for IV fluids and vitamins. Sepsis may
mimic lactic acidosis so it is often prudent to add a broad-spectrum
antibiotic.

Fatty liver:
(steatohepatitis) is also caused by NRTIs and is commonly associated
with hyperlactataemia. Management principles are similar. Patients
present with RUQ discomfort, firm hepatomegaly, and ↑ LFTs.

Pancreatitis:
is a complication of DDI > D4T. Management involves stopping ART,
admission and treatment for acute pancreatitis. Once resolved, ART
can be recommenced with a regimen excluding these 2 drugs.

Bone marrow suppression:
AZT may cause anaemia and neutropaenia, usually in the first 3
months of therapy. Patients with underlying marrow compromise (e.g.
nutritional or TB) are more at risk. Management involves blood
transfusions and neutropenic support if required. AZT should be
switched to an alternative drug (e.g. D4T), especially if Hb < 6.5 g/dl
and neutrophil <500/mm3.

Lipid and glucose abnormalities:
PIs may → hypercholesterolaemia and glucose intolerance (risk factors
for cardiovascular disease) and hypertriglyceridaemia (which may →
pancreatitis). Patients on PIs should have other cardiovascular risk
factors addressed (e.g. stop smoking) and all should be advised on a
low-fat diet. Hypertriglyceridaemia >10 mmol/l and
hypercholesterolaemia >7.5 mmol/l should be treated with dietary
intervention and fibrate and/or statin therapy.

Lipodystrophy:
(fat redistribution) is a consequence of long-term ART therapy. NRTIs
(D4T>AZT) result in lipoatrophy (loss of facial and limb fat) and PIs
result in lipohypertrophy (central obesity and dorsocervical fat
accumulation). Management involves switching to alternative agents if
possible, but reversal is slow.

Renal disease:
TDF is associated with renal dysfunction and Fanconi's syndrome (a
tubular wasting syndrome of protein, phosphate, and other substances)
in a minority of patients, particularly those with pre-existing renal
dysfunction. IDV may result in renal stones, particularly if a good fluid
intake is not maintained.

Abacavir hypersensitivity:
occurs in ~4% patients. Clinical features include flu-like symptoms,
rash, fever and hepatitis; may be life-threatening with continued use.
Management: stop abacavir; do not re-challenge.

Teratogenicity:
EFV is teratogenic (neural tube defects reported in animals and
humans in relation to first trimester exposure).

Neuropsychiatric:
side-effects also occur with EFV, including dizziness, inattention,
nightmares, dysphoria, and occasionally acute psychosis. These sideeffects occur early and resolve in the majority within a few weeks.
Advise patients to take EFV at night.

AZT-induced myopathy:
is described, usually after prolonged therapy.

ART metabolism and interactions
Drugs belonging to the NNRTI and PI classes have a number of
important drug interactions that need to be considered. These result
from the fact that they are substrates of the cytochrome P450 enzyme
system in the liver and intestine. In addition, the PIs are generally
inhibitors of these enzymes, nevirapine an inducer, and efavirenz may
be an inducer or inhibitor. Exceptions do, however, occur. Drugs that
are commonly involved in these interactions are:
Inducers:
Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin.
Inhibitors.
Macrolides, cimetidine, azoles (e.g. fluconazole).
Substrates.
Warfarin.
Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone.
Oral contraceptive.
Statins.
Benzodiazepines, especially midazolam.
Ergot alkaloids.
Macrolides.
Calcium channel blockers.
Azoles.
When prescribing other drugs with ART it is important to check for
interactions. A useful source of ART drug interaction information is:
www.hiv-druginteractions.org
Some combinations are contraindicated (e.g. ergotamine and PI) and
in others, dose adjustments are required (e.g. warfarin and nevirapine
guided by INR). The interactions may be bi-directional, for example,

carbamazepine and nevirapine may reduce each other's levels. Other
drug combinations share toxicities and should not be used together, for
example, ganciclovir and AZT because both drugs are bone marrow
suppressants.
NRTIs are not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system but are
excreted by the kidney. Certain interactions occur at this level e.g.
tenofovir increases didanosine levels and thus toxicity. For this reason
(and also because this combination is less potent than other NRTI
combinations), these two drugs should preferably not be used together.
If they are, the didanosine dose should be reduced. If renal function is
impaired, it is important to reduce the dose of NRTI drugs (see table p
111).

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
(IRIS)
After ART is commenced, there is a rapid reduction in HIV viral load
and a rise in CD4 count. This is accompanied by a restoration of
pathogen-specific immunity. Immunopathological reactions in the days
to months after starting ART may result as a consequence of immune
dysregulation. This is often in response to a high burden of microbial
antigen related to an OI that was present prior to ART. This is termed
IRIS, for which the following case definition has been proposed:
HIV-infected patient receiving ART with ↓ viral load and ↑ CD4 count
(which may lag behind the fall in viral load) plus
Clinical features consistent with inflammatory process and
Clinical course not consistent with expected course of either a
previously diagnosed OI or newly diagnosed OI or drug toxicity.

Several forms of IRIS are described:
‘Unmasking’ IRIS — this describes an inflammatory and often atypical
presentation of an OI soon after starting ART that was untreated
prior to ART commencement.
Paradoxical reactions — patients experience recurrence or worsening
of OI symptoms and signs after starting ART despite being on
appropriate OI treatment. The reaction here is thought to result
from an immune response directed towards residual antigen.
Sarcoidosis and auto-immune diseases (e.g. Grave's disease) are
described as IRIS phenomena.
Kaposi sarcoma may worsen with an increase in lesions or
inflammation of existing lesions in 5% of patients (most KS lesions
regress on ART).
Reactions to inert foreign materials (e.g. tattoos).
IRIS most commonly occurs in association with OI such as TB,
cryptococossis, MAC, CMV, and HBV. An example of a CMV ‘unmasking’
IRIS is a patient presenting with an inflammatory CMV uveitis after
starting ART. TB paradoxical reactions are seen in up to 45% of patients
starting ART while on TB treatment, manifesting as recurrence of fever
and other TB symptoms, enlarging lymphadenopathy, or recurrent
pulmonary infiltrates early after starting ART. Dermatological
manifestations (e.g. flare of acne) are also seen.

Management:
involves diagnosing the OI and excluding additional OIs or
antimicrobial resistance. In most cases, ART and effective OI therapy
should be continued. In certain severe cases, steroids (e.g. prednisone
1 mg/kg, duration dependent on response) should be considered. If the
reaction is life-threatening (e.g. CNS involvement) and not responding
to steroids, it may be necessary to interrupt ART.

Special aspects of paediatric HIV/AIDS

P.118

Diagnosis (WHO guidelines)
Early diagnosis is the key to effective management of HIV in children.
HIV-infected adults should be encouraged to get their children tested,
and in areas where the prevalence of paediatric HIV is more than a
few per cent, HIV testing should become a routine part of inpatient
care and not merely reserved for children with signs of advanced
HIV/AIDS.
In children >18 months, diagnosis is as for adults (

p 74)

In children <18 months, diagnosis is based on:
Positive virological test for HIV (HIV-RNA or HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive
HIV p24 antigen), confirmed by a second virological test obtained
from a separate sample taken >4 weeks after birth.
Positive antibody testing is not recommended for definitive or
confirmatory diagnosis of HIV infection in children until 18 months of
age.
However, presumptive diagnosis of severe HIV disease may be made
if:
the infant is seropositive and
an AIDS-defining illness is present or
the infant has symptoms of 2 or more of the following: oral thrush,
severe pneumonia, or severe sepsis.
Other factors supporting the diagnosis of severe HIV disease include:
Maternal death due to (or advanced) HIV infection.
% CD4 <20.
Confirmation of the diagnosis should be sought as soon as possible.

Effects on growth and development
Poor growth is one of the most sensitive indicators of HIV progression.
From birth, HIV-infected infants are often smaller and have lower

birthweight than uninfected children born to HIV-infected women.
Causes of poor growth include alterations in GI function, chronic or
recurrent infections, alterations in metabolic and endocrine function,
and side-effects of medication for HIV and OI. Pubertal delay is
common, especially among boys. The use of effective ART leads to
improvements in growth indices.

Prevention of opportunistic infections in
children
Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis has been shown to halve all cause
mortality, and is recommended for all HIV positive children. Primary
isoniazid preventative therapy is also associated with an all-cause
mortality benefit, although the optimal duration of therapy is
unknown.

Therapy of opportunistic infections in children
Whilst many of the principles required to recognize, diagnose, and
manage OI in children are similar to those in adults, there are
important differences e.g. higher incidence of some opportunistic
conditions in children and the problems posed by drug therapy. The
notes on the following pages emphasize management and are not
exhaustive. They are based on a comprehensive CDC review that is
available for download free from:
www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5314a1.htm

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP)
PCP is an important cause of ARI in children and the leading cause of
ARI among children aged 2-6 months. Treatment of ARI in the latter
group should always include PCP treatment; treat older children for
PCP when suspected clinically.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 15-20 mg/kg TMP plus 75100 mg/kg SMX IV or PO daily in 3-4 divided doses for 21 days.
Alternative therapies include:
Pentamidine 4 mg/kg IV od for 7-10 days followed by atovaquone
for 14 days.

Atovaquone 15-20 mg/kg (max 750 mg) bd.
Prednisolone (2 mg/kg for 5 days, 1 mg/kg for 5 days then 0.5 mg/kg
for 5 days) should be added if paO2 <70 mmHg (<9.3 kPa) on room air.
Lifelong secondary prophylaxis with TMP/SMX is recommended.

Toxoplasmosis
Congenital: Treat for 6 months with pyrimethamine (2 mg/kg od for 2
days then 1 mg/kg od for 2-6 months, then 1 mg/kg 3x weekly) plus
folinic acid 10 mg with each dose, plus sulfadiazine 50 mg/kg bd.
Acquired: Treat for 6 weeks with pyrimethamine (2 mg/kg [max 50
mg] od for 3 days then 1 mg/kg [max 25 mg] od) plus sulphadiazine
25-50 mg/kg qds plus folinic acid 10-25 mg od.
Clindamycin 5-7.5 mg/kg (max. 600 mg/dose) PO/IV qds can be
substituted for sulphadiazine.
Lifelong secondary prophylaxis is recommended.

Cryptosporidiosis
No consistently effective therapy exists and the best treatment is ART.

Microsporidiosis
The best treatment is ART, although albendazole 7.5 mg/kg (max 400
mg) bd is effective against all forms except Enterocytozoon bienusi.

Tuberculosis
Standard quadruple therapy but treat PTB for 9 m and
extrapulmonary TB for 12 m. Drug-resistant TB requires expert
advice. See below for combination with ART.
Adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids is recommended by some
for CNS, pericardial, and substantial endobronchial disease.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)

At least two drugs should be given: clarithromycin 7.5-15 mg/kg
(max. 500 mg) bd plus ethambutol 15-25 mg/kg (max. 1 g) od.
In severe disease, rifabutin 10-20 mg/kg (max. 300 mg) can be added
and azithromycin 10-12 mg/kg (max. 500 mg) od can be substituted
for clarithromycin.

Candidiasis
Oropharyngeal: Fluconazole 3-6 mg/kg (max 400 mg) od for 7-14 days
or itraconazole 2.5 mg/kg (max 200-400 mg) bd. (Nystatin and
clotrimazole preparations are less effective.)
Oesophageal: As for oropharyngeal candidiasis but extend treatment
for 21 days.
Invasive: Ampotericin B (AmB) 0.5-1.5 mg/kg IV od until 2-3 weeks
after last positive blood culture. If AmB is unavailable, fluconazole
can be used at 5-6 mg/kg bd (max 800 mg/day).

Coccidiomycosis
Diffuse pulmonary or disseminated: AmB 0.5-1.0 mg/kg IV od for
several weeks, followed by chronic suppressive therapy with an
azole.
Meningeal infection: Fluconazole 5-6 mg/kg bd (max 800 mg/day) for
several weeks followed by secondary prophylaxis.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Congenital: Ganciclovir 6 mg/kg IV bd for 6 weeks.
Retinitis & visceral disease: Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV bd for 14-21 days
followed by 5 mg/kg IV od 5-7 days per week as suppressive therapy.
An alternative is foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV tds for 10-21 days then 90-120
mg/kg od for chronic suppression.

Cryptococcosis

AmB 0.75-1.5 mg/kg IV od for at least 2 weeks plus flucytosine 25
mg/kg PO qds.
If AmB unavailable, fluconazole 5-6 mg/kg bd (max 800 mg/day) can
be used, although its efficacy in children is not documented.
Chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole should also be
instituted.

Histoplasmosis
Mild: Itraconazole 4-10 mg/kg bd (max 600 mg daily) IV/PO for 3
days, followed by 2-5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) bd for 12-16 weeks.
Severe and disseminated: AmB 1 mg/kg IV od for 2-3 weeks followed
by consolidation therapy as above.
Lifelong secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole is recommended.

HSV
Neonatal: Aciclovir 20 mg/kg IV tds for 21 days.
CNS: Outside neonatal period acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV tds for 21 days.
Gingivostomatitis: Aciclovir 5-10 mg/kg IV tds.
Genital herpes: Aciclovir 20 mg/kg (max 400 mg) PO tds for 7-10
days.
Foscarnet can be given for acyclovir-resistant disease. 2nd
generation nucleoside analogues (valaciclovir, famcicolvir,
penciclovir) are not fully evaluated in children.

VZV
Chickenpox: Aciclovir 10 mg/kg IV tds for 7 days or until no new
lesions. Oral acyclovir (20 mg/kg qds) should only be used for
children with very mild disease or in those with normal or only
slightly decreased CD4 counts.
Zoster: Aciclovir 20 mg/kg PO qds for 7-10 days; consider IV acyclovir

10 mg/kg in severe immunodeficiency.

HCV
Interferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Treatment is expensive and not
available in most low-resource settings. Treat HCV genotype-1
infections for 48 weeks; genotypes 2 and 3 can be treated for 24 weeks.

HBV
Interferon-alpha. Treat for 6 months if HBeAg +ve, 12 months if
HBeAg -ve.
The antiretrovirals lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (TDF) have
activity against HBV. 3TC monotherapy can give rise to drugresistant HBV and ideally should be combined in HBsAg +ve children
but the data on TDF dosage in childhood are limited.

ART in children

P.124

The best way to reduce paediatric HIV is to reduce MTCT. However,
~1500 new infections occur daily in children <15 years, the majority in
the developing world. HIV-infected children frequently become
symptomatic, and 30% die in the first year of life. There is thus a need
to provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected infants and
children.

When to start ART
The following are indications for starting ART in infants and children
based on clinical stage of disease, CD4, and total lymphocyte count
(see tables opposite):
Stage 4 disease, irrespective of CD4 count. Treat and stabilize active
OI first.
Stage 3 disease. (If age >12 months and the stage 3 defining disease
is TB, LIP, oral hairy leukoplakia, or thrombocytopenia, and the CD4
is above threshold, then ART could be deferred.)

Stage 1 or 2 disease with CD4 or total lymphocyte count (TLC) below
threshold for severe immunodeficiency (see table opposite).

General principles
Use one formulation or a fixed-drug combination (FDC) if possible.
Use syringes to accurately dose liquid formulations.
Avoid large volumes of liquid drugs; switch to solids when possible.
If solid paediatric formulations unavailable, adapt adult forms. Many
tablets can be divided in half.
Some adult FDCs (e.g. those contaning NVP) may underdose during
induction and should be avoided during this phase.
Avoid differing a.m. and p.m. regimens where possible.
Weigh the child at each visit and adjust doses accordingly.
If capsules or tablets are broken into food, ensure all food is eaten.

Recommended first-line ART regimens
AZT + 3TC + NVP/EFV or
D4T + 3TC + NVP/EFV or
ABC + 3TC + NVP/EFV or
Triple NRTI (to simplify drug interaction and toxicity) or
AZT/d4T + 3TC + ABC.
The disadvantage of the triple NRTI combination is its lower virological
potency in adults. The advantages are that it can be combined with TB
treatment (see below), is non-teratogenic in pregnant adolescent girls,
and when combined as a single pill can improve adherence. There is
insufficient evidence to guide prescribing in infants who were exposed
to the maternal or infant component of MTCT treatment or in infants
exposed via breastfeeding. A particular concern is children exposed to
single-dose NVP. WHO recommends that the above first-line regimens
be used in the first instance.

Dosage of paediatric ART
This is a complex area because of a relative lack of pharmacological
data and formulations appropriate to children. What is presented is
derived from WHO guidelines (2006).* Readers are encouraged to seek
specialist advice where possible. Where body surface area (BSA) has
been used, this is calculated by the formula:

ART toxicity in children
Overall, the spectrum of adverse events is similar to adults (see
above). Hypersensitivity and hepatitis due to NVP are somewhat less
frequent. Severe toxicities and potential drugs to switch to are listed
in the table below (source WHO). In general, acute serious adverse
reactions require discontinuation of all ART until the symptoms
resolve. More chronic or subacute toxicities may be managed by
withdrawing and then substituting the most likely offending drug (e.g.
AZT-induced anaemia).

Switching to second-line therapy due to
treatment failure
Poor adherence or drug absorption and viral drug resistance can
contribute to treatment failure. Prior to switching therapy, ensure that
≥24 weeks of treatment have been completed, adherence has been
optimized, and the CD4 count has been measured at least twice. As far
as possible exclude IRIS (
p 116) as a cause of clinical deterioration.
The CD4 criteria to guide decision making on switching are as follows
(see table on p 125 for age-related definitions of severe
immunodeficiency):
development of severe immunodeficiency after initial immune
recovery.
new progressive severe immunodeficiency, confirmed with at least
one subsequent CD4 measurement.
rapid decline to below threshold of severe immunodeficiency.

Combining ART with TB treatment in children:
special considerations
This is a complex area with little evidence to guide practice.
Essentially:

TB may be an indication for ART.
The development of TB during ART may be a sign of ART failure.
Alternatively, TB may become manifest (‘umasking IRIS’) or worsen
(‘paradoxical IRIS’) during ART.
Rifampicin-based therapy for TB complicates the choice of ART.

When to start ART
For WHO stage 4 disease and for stage 3 disease where no CD4 is
available, ART should be commenced 2-8 weeks after starting TB
therapy. If the response to TB in stage 3 disease is very good and the
child is on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, ART can be delayed. For stage 3
disease where the CD4 indicates mild or no immunodeficiency, ART can
be deferred providing clinical response is satisfactory. If the CD4
indicates severe immunodeficiency, ART should be started.

Optimum drug regimens
WHO recommends either a triple NRTI regime (AZT or d4T + 3TC + ABC)
or two NRTI + NVP (<3 years) or EFZ (≥3 years). In children already on
such a regime, the advent of TB may herald treatment failure. If this is
established, switching regimens may be required — specialist advice
should ideally be sought. If the child is already on a PI-containing
regimen, again expert advice will be required to determine the
optimal salvage regimen in the clinical circumstances.

TB-IRIS
An alternative explanation for clinical deterioration of TB or the rapid
appearance of TB during ART is TB-IRIS. This syndrome is even more
poorly characterized in children than it is in adults, but typically
occurs within weeks of starting ART. A pronounced inflammatory
component is characteristic, as is the history of a previously good
response to TB treatment. Wherever possible, ART should not be
discontinued and the IRIS should be treated symptomatically. There is
no hard evidence for the concurrent use of steroid therapy but this
may be considered in children with severe and life-threatening forms

of IRIS involving vital structures or the CNS (prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg
per day).

Prevention

P.130

In the absence of a vaccine, primary prevention is the only method of
controlling the AIDS pandemic. Strategies to control HIV infection
should be aimed at the main methods of transmission: sexual,
parenteral, and vertical.

Sexual
Changing high-risk sexual behaviour through health education could
have a major effect on sexual HIV transmission. It would also have a
marked effect on STI transmission. Creative educational approaches
that respect cultural traditions are necessary to make the population
aware of the dangers of HIV infection and AIDS, and to encourage
protective measures. Several governments have now initiated such
health education programmes. However, these programmes will have
to be accompanied by approaches that influence the social
determinants of risk, such as gender inequality, to enable those
vulnerable to infection to protect themselves. It is increasingly
recognized that male circumcision is an important additional HIV
prevention intervention.

Blood transfusion
Screening of blood donations for HIV antibody may result in high
benefit-to-cost ratio for the prevention of AIDS in populations with a
high infection rate. Drawbacks are cost, logistics, and the lack of
detectable HIV antibodies for 3-6 weeks (with 3rd generation ELISAs)
after infection. Efforts to identify and exclude high-risk donors have
proven to be difficult, but they may be important in decreasing the
risk of HIV-infected sero-negative persons donating blood.

Injections
Prevention of infection through contaminated needles is feasible with

the use of universal precautions. However, the use of disposable
needles and syringes may be prohibitively expensive for some
countries and health workers should be trained to give as few
injections as possible and to sterilize reusable equipment. The risk of
transmission after a needlestick injury may be reduced by
antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis (see
p 134).

Vertical
Most importantly, this involves the prevention of HIV infection in
women of childbearing age and advice on contraception to HIV +ve
women. See next page for details of prevention of MTCT.

Prevention of mother to child transmission
(MTCT)

P.132

The cumulative risk of HIV transmission from mother to her child is 3040% in the absence of preventive interventions. The following
measures have been shown to substantially reduce this risk:
Formula feeding: WHO recommends that, where the 1° causes of
infant deaths are infectious disease and malnutrition, the standard
advice to pregnant women (including those known to be HIV +ve)
should be to breastfeed; where this is not the case, HIV +ve women
are advised not to breastfeed but to use a safe feeding alternative
for their babies. There may also be socio-cultural reasons why
women choose to breastfeed. Formula feeding should only be
considered in a setting where there is a reliable supply of both
formula feed and safe water. If exclusive formula feeding cannot be
guaranteed, then exclusive breastfeeding is advisable as it carries a
lower risk of mother to child transmission than mixed breast and
formula feeding.
Elective caesarian section has been shown to reduce the risk of
transmission, particularly in women with high viral loads, but is not
practical as a routine procedure in most high-prevalence settings.
ART to prevent transmission: Various regimens have been studied
and utilized. In general, the following are the options:

1. Single dose nevirapine 200 mg to mother in labour and single dose
to infant (2 mg/kg) within 72 h of delivery. This reduces
transmission risk to ~8% provided mother does not breastfeed.
2. Dual therapy (e.g. AZT to mother from 28 weeks and to infant for 1
week, and single-dose nevirapine to mother and infant as above).
This reduces the risk to ~2% provided the infant is not breastfed.
There are other dual therapy options.
3. Triple drug ART starting in the second trimester reduces the risk to
around 1%. Women for whom ART is indicated for their own health
because of advanced HIV should be started on ART and continue
ART after the pregnancy; those that receive it for prevention of
MTCT alone should stop ART in the month after the pregnancy. On
stopping ART, continue the NRTIs for 5-10 days after stopping
nevirapine, because of the long half-life of nevirapine. Note that
EFV and the combination of D4T+DDI are contraindicated in
pregnancy. It is not advisable to commence nevirapine in women
with CD4>250 because of higher risk of hepatotoxicity.
The use of single-dose nevirapine (options 1 and 2) carries the risk of
causing NNRTI resistance in the mother and infected infant, and
compromising future ART options. While ART is obviously the optimal
form of MTCT prevention, resource and service limitations in many
developing world settings result in one of the other options being
chosen at a programme level.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following
needlestick injuries

P.134

Health care workers (HCW) are at risk of HIV infection if they sustain a
needlestick injury with a needle that has been used in someone who is
HIV infected. The estimated risk of infection is 0.3% per needlestick
event. Injuries are regarded as high risk if the needle was in a vessel,
the injury was deep, if there was visible blood on the needle, or if the
source patient has a high viral load. Splash injuries with HIV-infected
blood onto non-intact skin (e.g. dermatitis or open wound) or mucous
membranes, including conjunctivae, may also result in HIV infection

(estimated risk of transmission ~0.1%). Other fluids such as CSF and
serous effusions are also potentially infectious. Following a significant
exposure, the risk of transmission can be substantially reduced by
taking PEP for 28 days (AZT monotherapy reduced risk by 81%).
Other infections that can be potentially transmitted in such
circumstances are HBV, HCV, and syphilis.
Action that should be taken following a needlestick or splash injury:
Local measures — prolonged washing with soap.
ART PEP should start as soon as possible. This should be taken before
the source patient's status is known. If the patient is HIV-uninfected,
the PEP can be stopped. See table opposite for recommended
regimens.
Obtain consent from the source patient for HIV testing if status is
unknown. Also test for hepatitis B and C and VDRL status (do the
same tests for HCW — if the HCW is HIV positive, then PEP should
NOT be prescribed).
Counsel the HCW. Psychological support is necessary.
Document details of the event and all investigations and
management. This is critical for compensation of HCWs who
seroconvert.
If patient is HIV-seronegative, stop PEP unless it is clinically
suspected that the patient has a seroconversion illness.
If the patient is HIV-infected or the status is unknown, continue PEP
for 28 days.
In HCW on PEP regimens containing AZT, the Hb and neutrophil count
should be checked at baseline and 2 weeks.
The HCW should have an HIV ELISA test performed at 6 weeks, 3
months, and 6 months (PEP may delay seroconversion).
The HCW should be advised to use condoms or abstain from sexual
intercourse until seronegativity is documented.
If the HCW is not Hepatitis B immunized and the source patient is

Hepatitis B infected, then Hep B immunoglobulin and vaccination
should be administered. HCWs who have been immunized but have
inadequate antibody titres (<10 mIU/ml) may require booster
vaccination.
If source patient is on ART and suspected to have drug resistance, then
standard PEP should be instituted as soon as possible but modification
in the regimen, based on likely resistance patterns, discussed with an
expert.
Side-effects such as nausea are common with AZT and antiemetics may
be required. It must be remembered that drugs used for PEP are
potentially toxic. Thus, PEP should not be administered if the risk of
infection is negligible.

In these settings, if source patient has risk factors for HIV

drug PEP should be considered. In areas with high HIV
prevalence rates it would be advisable to prescribe PEP in
such circumstances.

Guidelines are similar for splash injuries to non-intact skin or mucous
membranes, but generally 2 drugs are used unless there is a large
volume of blood from a high-risk patient. No PEP is required for a
splash injury to intact skin.

Running an ART Clinic
Provision of ART in a clinical service that is well coordinated and
prepared for this task is important for providing optimum patient care,
ensuring patient follow-up and adherence, and achieving long-term
success from the therapy for patients. The following are key
components of a successful service:
Staffing — medical, nursing, counselling, pharmacy, and clerical staff
all form an important part of the service. Some clinical services are
run by doctors, others by nurses with the doctor seeing complicated
cases only.
Adequate counselling services — often lay people who have been
trained to be HIV and ART adherence counsellors play a very
important part in the preparation of patients for ART. Being from
the patients' community, speaking their language, and having time
specifically for counselling, they can ensure the patient has a

thorough knowledge of their disease and the treatment, and address
any concerns.
Team work — all members of the clinical team are important. The
decision whether a patient is ready to commence ART, is best made
collectively, with all members of the team contributing their insights
as to the patient's medical and psychosocial readiness. A formal
team meeting is useful for this.
A reliable drug supply is essential — patients cannot afford to have
the health service letting them down if they are adherent. The
pharmacist in the clinic should play a role in educating patients
regarding exactly how to take their medication and what sideeffects they might expect.
Data collection and management — Clerical staff play an important
role in ensuring reliable and accurate data are collected and stored.
Often those sponsoring ART programmes will require outcome data,
and audit of clinic practice is important for quality of care
assurance.
Psychological, social worker, and nutritional input are also
important.

Palliative care

P.138

Pain
Pain in late-stage HIV-positive patients is often multi-factorial, and
treatment plans should recognize this. Common problems include
painful peripheral neuropathies, post-zoster pain, pain related to
disseminated KS involving a limb, HIV cholangiopathy, oral and
perineal aphthous ulceration, and bedsores.
Start by attempting to address the cause e.g. treating bacterial
pneumonia can control the chest pain associated with it. More
commonly, the cause cannot be remedied, and attention should be
given to appropriate analgesia. Neuropathic pain may respond to lowdose tricyclics — e.g. amitriptyline 10-25 mg nocte. The addition of
carbamazepine 200 mg bd, working up to 400 mg bd may be of benefit

(but note interaction with NNRTI and PIs). Patients with
musculoskeletal pain may respond to NSAIDs e.g. ibuprofen 400 mg
tds. In patients with less easily characterized pain, or where sideeffects may be an issue, start with paracetamol 1 g qds. When control
is inadequate with simple analgesics, codeine or tramadol can be
added. Frequently, it is appropriate to move on to the use of oral
morphine (
see p 676 for regimen). Give laxatives to prevent and
treat opiate-induced constipation.

Chronic diarrhoea
Simple attention to nursing basics (gloves for attendants, disposable
nappies for patients) may make a considerable impact. In patients
unable to access ART, which often relieves chronic diarrhoea,
consideration needs to be given to the use of antidiarrhoeals such as
loperamide or diphenoxylate/atropine.

Dyspnoea
Patients with terminal pulmonary metastatic malignancy (e.g. Kaposi
sarcoma) are often very dyspnoeic. Tapping a large effusion may cause
some relief, as may supplementary oxygen via face mask or nasal
prongs. Most severely ill patients with profound dyspnoea will,
however, require judicious sedation with morphine.

Family support
Family support for late-stage HIV-positive individuals can be very
helpful, but requires considerable counselling input. If breadwinners
(e.g. a spouse) need to temporarily become care-givers, then shortterm assistance with social grants can help. Time and effort spent on
empowering and encouraging families can decrease hospital
admissions.

Current global situation and trends
Tuberculosis (TB) has been curable for more than 50 years, yet the
global burden of morbidity and mortality due to TB continues to
increase, the impact being greatest in sub-Saharan Africa.
Approximately one-third of the world's population is infected with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with nearly 9 million developing active TB
and almost 2 million dying of TB each year. About 95% of cases occur in
low-income countries and 75% are in the 15-50 age group. Both globally
and within countries, there is a striking link between poverty and TB.
Modern TB treatment regimens of 6-8 months are highly effective in
curing patients and preventing transmission. TB treatment is among
the most cost-effective of all health interventions.
Several important developments have occurred in the past two
decades:
TB incidence has increased dramatically in communities highly
endemic for HIV, particularly in Africa.
Increasing drug resistance caused by deficiencies in TB treatment
programmes, decreasing cure rates and complicating TB control.
Expansion of ‘DOTS’ TB control programmes in much of the
developing world, leading to stabilizing or declining incidence

except in sub-Saharan Africa.

Lessons learned in TB treatment and control
TB treatment and control is a core public health activity since
identifying and curing infectious patients is the principal means by
which we can reduce transmission and prevent new infections in the
community.
In stable political situations, the public sector has primary
responsibility for ensuring the proper functioning of TB treatment
and control, usually through the establishment of a National
Tuberculosis Programme.
TB treatment must be provided free of charge to patients.
TB treatment and control must be integrated with the general
health services of the community since that is where TB cases
present.

Elements of the WHO ‘DOTS’ (directly observed therapy,
short course) TB control strategy
Sustained political commitment.
Microscopy: case detection using sputum smear microscopy among
symptomatic patients presenting to the health services.
SCC/DOT: standardized short-course chemotherapy (SCC) using
regimens of 6-8 months at least for all confirmed smear-positive
cases. Good case management includes directly observed therapy
(DOT) during the intensive phase for all new sputum-positive
cases, during the continuation phase when rifampicin is used, and
throughout a re-treatment regimen.
Drug supply: establishment and maintenance of a system to supply
all essential anti-TB drugs and to ensure no interruption in their
availability.
Recording and reporting: establishment and maintenance of a
standardized recording and reporting system, allowing assessment
of treatment results.

Disease and pathogenesis
Microbiology
Mycobacteria are slender aerobic bacilli which are ‘acid-fast’ on ZiehlNeelsen (ZN) staining. Members of the genus Mycobacterium which are
of particular interest in the tropics include M. leprae and M. ulcerans,
the causes of leprosy and Buruli ulcer (see Chapters 10 and 14). The M.
tuberculosis complex comprises M. tuberculosis, M. africanum, and M.

bovis: M. africanum, seen mainly in Africa, behaves clinically and
epidemiologically like M. tuberculosis. M. bovis is a pathogen of cattle
and other species of domestic and wild animals. Subsequent references
to M. tuberculosis refer to the M. tuberculosis complex unless
otherwise stated.
M. tuberculosis multiplies slowly so that up to 6 weeks are required for
growth in culture. Correspondingly, disease due to M. tuberculosis
tends to progress relatively slowly, and responds slowly to treatment.

Transmission
Individuals with active pulmonary TB produce airborne droplet nuclei
containing infectious M. tuberculosis in the course of speaking,
sneezing, and particularly coughing. Infection occurs when these are
inhaled by a susceptible individual. Crowding, poor ventilation, and
duration of exposure increase the risk of transmission. M. bovis can
also be transmitted by the airborne route, but human infection often
occurs through ingestion of unpasteurized milk from infected cows.
Other sources of M. tuberculosis infection, except for handling TB
cultures in the laboratory, are extremely rare.

TB infection
Aerosolized particles containing M. tuberculosis reach the alveoli
where they initiate a non-specific response. The bacilli are ingested by
macrophages and transported to regional lymph nodes. They may
either be contained there or spread via the lymphatics or bloodstream
to other organs. With the development of specific cell-mediated
immunity, cytokines secreted by lymphocytes recruit and activate
macrophages, which organize into the granulomas characteristic of TB,
effectively walling in the organisms.
In immunocompetent hosts, the most common outcome of infection
with M. tuberculosis is containment of the infection without the
development of clinical illness. A granuloma can sometimes be seen on
CXR; more commonly, the lesion is not detectable radiographically and
a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or T-cell-based assay is the only
evidence of infection. A distinctive characteristic of M. tuberculosis is

its ability to persist intracellularly in a quiescent state, within
macrophages, retaining the ability to reactivate at a later time. This is
known as ‘latent tuberculous infection’.

Active TB disease
On average ~10% of immunocompetent adults infected with M.
tuberculosis ultimately develop active TB. About half of this risk is
concentrated in the first 1-2 years after infection, the other half is
distributed over the remainder of the individual's lifetime. A number of
factors greatly increase the risk of disease reactivation (see box).
In a minority of cases, infants or those with depressed cell-mediated
immunity being at particular risk, 1° infection is not contained and
symptomatic disease develops directly from 1° infection (progressive
1° TB).
Post primary TB occurs as a reactivation of latent infection, sometimes
years after the 1° infection; sometimes, but not always, due to an
identifiable immunosuppressive condition.
Patients, particularly those with HIV infection, can be reinfected with
a new strain of M. tuberculosis after successful treatment of TB, but
the proportion of TB cases attributable to this mechanism is unclear.
Risk factors for development of active TB disease in individuals
infected with M. tuberculosis
HIV — the most powerful known factor.
Recent infection — the risk per year of developing active TB is
much greater in the first 1-2 years after infection.
Age — weakened immunity at the extremes of age.
Malnutrition, including vitamin D deficiency.
Diabetes mellitus.
Silicosis or other types of lung fibrosis.
Intercurrent infections (e.g. measles, visceral leishmaniasis).
Toxic factors (e.g. alcohol and smoking).
Poverty — probably many biologic mechanisms involved.

Immune suppression (e.g. corticosteroid therapy, malignancy).
‘Herd immunity’ — members of populations with little historical
exposure to TB appear to be more susceptible to disease.

Clinical features
The diagnostic resources available varies widely in different settings
where TB is treated. This section mentions technologies such as TB
culture and histologic examination of biopsies, which may be required
for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary and other less common forms of
TB. However, the majority of TB cases, especially those with the
poorest prognosis and those most infectious to others, can be
diagnosed with very basic resources, particularly smear microscopy.

TB in adults
One or more non-specific systemic symptoms — weight loss, anorexia,
fever, night sweats, or malaise — are present in the majority of
patients.
Pulmonary TB (PTB) is the most common presentation. It is also the
most important epidemiologically since it is the form which is
infectious to others. However, TB may affect any organ, leading to a
variety of clinical presentations.

Pulmonary TB (PTB)
Involves the lung parenchyma. The great majority of patients have a
cough, which is often productive. A cough of prolonged duration (>3
weeks) should always raise the suspicion of TB. Haemoptysis, chest
pain, or breathlessness may also be present in some patients.
Physical examination is often normal or the findings non-specific. Some
patients may look ill and wasted with a fever and tachycardia, but a
few can appear surprisingly well. Chest examination may reveal
localized crackles or findings of a pleural effusion. Finger clubbing
suggests a diagnosis other than TB, such as lung cancer, bronchiectasis,
or empyema but occasionally bronchiectasis may be 2° to lung damage

from chronic or previous PTB.
Approximately 65% of PTB cases, somewhat less in the HIV-infected,
are sputum smear positive. Smear-positive patients are most
infectious (several times more likely to transmit TB than patients who
are smear-negative, even if culture-positive) and also sickest (without
treatment, their average mortality is considerably higher than that of
smear-negative patients). A positive smear for acid-fast bacilli in a
high TB prevalence area almost always indicates TB since M.
tuberculosis occurs much more frequently than atypical mycobacteria
in these settings.
Smear-negative PTB is relatively common but the diagnosis always
involves a degree of uncertainty. Many of these patients will become
smear-positive later if not treated. While under-diagnosis of smearnegative PTB is clearly undesirable, over-diagnosis also creates
problems, by misusing the scarce resources of the TB programme,
overlooking other treatable diagnoses, and undermining the
programme's credibility in the community by reducing the success rate
of treatment.

Complications of pulmonary TB:
Acute complications include haemoptysis which is occasionally lifethreatening, and pneumothorax. Chronic complications include post-TB
bronchiectasis, extensive lung fibrosis, and aspergillomas (fungus balls)
in residual cavities.

Pleural TB
An effusion can often be detected on physical examination and
confirmed by X-ray and/or diagnostic aspiration. In TB endemic areas,
in the absence of obvious alternative explanations such as heart
failure, acute pneumonia, or malignancy, TB will be the most common
cause of a ‘strawcoloured’ effusion. TB effusions are exudates (fluid
protein >50% serum protein concentration) and contain increased
lymphocytes but are seldom smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Many
patients with pleural TB also have involvement of the pulmonary
parenchyma. Hence, sputum examination should always be performed.

Culture of pleural biopsy tissue is very sensitive and histology of a
pleural biopsy usually shows granulomas.

TB lymphadenitis
Can involve any site, but cervical lymph nodes are most common.
Nodes may initially be rubbery and non-tender, becoming matted or
fluctuant, and sometimes discharging spontaneously through the skin
to produce chronic sinuses with scar formation. The nodes have
typically been present for weeks or months, and are seldom acutely
inflamed, distinguishing them from most lymphadenopathy due to
acute viral or bacterial infections. Paradoxically, they sometimes
enlarge during anti-TB therapy. These characteristics, and the
asymmetrical involvement, help to distinguish most cases of TB
adenitis from the persistent generalized lymphadenopathy of HIV.
A needle aspiration is often smear-positive in HIV-infected patients,
less frequently among HIV-negative lymph node TB patients. If the
smear is negative, diagnosis can be confirmed by excision biopsy of a
node, usually a minor procedure in adults, with histologic examination
and/or culture.

Bone TB
Most commonly affects the spine (Pott's disease). Vertebral collapse
may ultimately produce a characteristic angular deformity. Some
patients develop features of spinal cord involvement. Paravertebral
cold abscesses or psoas abscesses may accompany Pott's disease but do
not generally require open surgical drainage.
The presence of a characteristic angular kyphosis or ‘gibbus’ in a TBendemic area is virtually diagnostic of spinal TB. In the absence of this
striking clinical finding, X-ray changes with intervertebral disc and
adjacent bone involvement ± paravertebral soft tissue densities
suggest an infectious aetiology, but cannot reliably distinguish between
TB and other infections (e.g. brucellosis, staphylococal). If present, a
cold abscess can be aspirated for ZN staining ± culture; most abscesses
will be smear-negative. Imaging-guided biopsy of the infected disc or
adjacent bone can provide a histologic or microbiologic diagnosis, but

requires sophisticated resources. Spinal TB generally responds well to
drug treatment. Occasionally, patients may present with rapidly
progressive spinal cord compression and these patients may benefit
from urgent surgery to decompress the spinal cord and stabilize the
spine. If that is not available, strict bed rest should be used until the
neurological features improve after several weeks of treatment.
Exceptional patients with severe deformities or chronic neurologic
compromise might benefit from neuro or orthopaedic
surgery if available. With these exceptions, neurologic improvement or
even complete recovery, albeit with persistent deformity, occurs with
medical therapy alone in most patients. TB of other joints such as hip
and knee generally requires synovial biopsy to distinguish TB from
other chronic infections.

Miliary TB
Is an aggressive form of hematogenously disseminated TB more
common in infants and the immune suppressed. Typically, there is a
rather non-specific but progressive history of fever, malaise, and
weight loss without other identifiable cause. Clinical suspicion is raised
by a history of known or likely recent contact with infectious TB.
Physical findings are commonly non-specific but can include
hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly, tachypnoea, and wasting.
A CXR demonstrating diffuse, tiny, nodular opacities is the clue to
miliary TB and warrants initiation of TB treatment if the clinical
picture is compatible. Occasionally, choroidal tubercles are visible on
fundoscopy. Sputum smear examination and TST are often negative. If
available, biopsy of liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, or lung
parenchyma may yield granulomata and/or acid-fast bacilli.

TB meningitis
More common in children and the immune suppressed. It presents as a
progressive febrile illness which may be accompanied by headache,
irritability, vomiting, and decreased consciousness, ultimately
progressing to coma. The pace of illness is characteristically slower
than in acute bacterial meningitis. Neck stiffness is variable, especially

early in the course. Cranial nerve palsies (particularly III, IV, VI, and
VIII) occur commonly, reflecting the basilar distribution of the
inflammation. Seizures and focal neurologic deficits can also develop.
Diagnosis of TB meningitis rests on CSF examination. Typically, the CSF
white blood count is increased with a lymphocytic predominance, the
protein is elevated and glucose decreased, although all 3 abnormalities
are not present in every case. CSF should also be examined to exclude
cryptococcus if there is any possibility of HIV infection. CSF is rarely
smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli; culture is positive in the majority.
A decision to start TB treatment must be made on the basis of clinical
features, suggestive CSF abnormalities, and the absence of a likely
alternative diagnosis, since delay in treatment is a major predictor of
poor outcome. In some early cases, the diagnosis may be suggested
when the clinical course and evolution of CSF findings on repeat
examination over a few days are more typical of TB than of
alternative diagnoses such as viral or bacterial infection. The
available evidence and most expert opinion supports adjunctive
therapy with corticosteroids at a suggested dose of prednisone 1
mg/kg/day for 1 month, then tapered over 2-4 weeks.
Intracranial tuberculomas (presenting as epilepsy or focal neurological
deficit, and seen on brain scans) may accompany TB meningitis, or
may develop in isolation or as part of disseminated (miliary) TB.
Tuberculomas may also develop or enlarge ‘paradoxically’ during
treatment of these forms of TB, and require prolonged courses of
steroids along with TB treatment.

Abdominal TB
Gastrointestinal TB may present as abdominal pain, weight loss,
diarrhoea or partial bowel obstruction with a history of fever. It can
occur at any site in the GI tract, most commonly, the terminal ileum.
The diagnosis is usually made from specimens taken at surgery or
endoscopy; the histology resembles that of Crohn's disease. Often
peritoneal tuberculosis supervenes after some time, increasing
abdominal distension being the first sign. Peritoneal TB may be
suspected on the basis of ascites without another obvious cause such

as liver disease. The characteristics of the ascitic fluid are similar to
those of TB pleural fluid (see above). The peritoneum has a
characteristic appearance on direct inspection; culture and histology
of a peritoneal biopsy, preferably taken at laparoscopy, is usually
required for diagnosis. CT scans may show thickened terminal ileum,
mesenteric lymph nodes, thickened contrast-enhancing peritoneum,
and ascites. Oesophageal TB occurs occasionally, causing ulceration
and strictures; mediastinal lymph nodes may compress or erode into
the oesophagus, or cause a fistula to the trachea or bronchi.

Pericardial TB
Is often first suspected on the basis of globular enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette on CXR in patients investigated for systemic and
cardiorespiratory symptoms. It is more common in HIV-infected
patients. Clinical features of tamponade (elevated jugular venous
pressure, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension) may be present and a
pericardial rub is occasionally noted. Ultrasound can readily confirm
an effusion. Therapeutic pericardial aspiration for tamponade requires
ultrasound or at least ECG control; pericardial fluid has the same
characteristics as pleural fluid in TB (see above). In practice, the
diagnosis must often be made by demonstrating the presence of an
effusion in the absence of other likely aetiologies. The risk of
tamponade and later constriction is reduced by adding corticosteroids
for the first 6-12 weeks of TB treatment. The recommended adult dose
is prednisone 60 mg/day tapered over up to 12 weeks.

Genitourinary TB
Can involve any part of the male or female genitourinary tract. Renal
TB may present with dysuria, hematuria, and pain or a mass in the
flank. The urinalysis typically shows pus cells, but routine culture is
negative. Diagnosis usually requires TB culture of urine. TB of the
uterus or adenexae presents as infertility, pelvic pain or mass, or
bleeding. Epididymal swelling is the most common presentation of
genital TB in males. Biopsy is usually required to distinguish TB from
other possible causes, though imaging (CT scan) may be suggestive of
TB.

TB in children
The probability of progression to disease following M. tuberculosis
exposure is greater in infants and young children than in adults. Infants
who develop TB have a high fatality rate without prompt treatment.
By contrast, children in the 7 to 12 age range have the lowest risk, of
any age group, of developing active TB.
Even where culture, X-ray, and other facilities are available, diagnosis
of childhood TB is often very difficult. TB may be suspected clinically
in the presence of persistent fever, malaise, and cough. A history of
close contact with a smear-positive pulmonary TB patient makes TB
more likely. A positive TST is suggestive of TB in a child with an
unexplained illness, because the incidental or ‘background’ rate of TST
positivity is expected to be low in this age group. Sputum-smear
microscopy is usually negative in children with PTB. A CXR may show
enlarged intrathoracic lymph nodes with or without lung consolidation.
Culture of specimens obtained by gastric lavage or sputum induction
can improve the rate of confirmed diagnosis. Several scoring systems
have been developed to rationalize the diagnosis of childhood TB —
none has been validated, but they may provide a framework to guide
the approach of the puzzled clinician. An example is given below.

Diagnosis

P.150

Sputum smears
Access to reliable, quality controlled sputum smear microscopy is a
prerequisite to the establishment of a TB treatment programme. Three
sputum samples should be examined microscopically in any patient
who has been coughing for >2-3 weeks. When patients must travel
some distance to the clinic, the ‘spot-morning-spot’ protocol can be
used: the 1st specimen is collected and submitted at presentation, the
2nd is an early-morning sputum produced at home the next morning
and submitted at a clinic visit that day, and the 3rd is produced and
submitted during that clinic visit.

Chest X-ray
CXR is not routinely necessary for the diagnosis and management of
TB. It is most useful in patients with undiagnosed chest symptoms who
are repeatedly smear-negative and in identifying other findings such as
pleural effusions or nodules. The interpretation of a CXR varies with
the skill of the reader and even between skilled readers. A normal CXR
makes PTB unlikely. However, a CXR cannot distinguish reliably
between TB and other diseases or between changes of active and past,

inactive TB. It does not predict infectiousness (as the sputum smear
does), nor supply the definitive identification provided by culture.

Diagnosis of sputum smear-negative TB
Reassessment and repeat sputum examinations after 2-3 weeks,
following a therapeutic trial of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, may
clarify the diagnosis. CXR, interpreted with the cautions mentioned
below, may help to estimate the likelihood of TB in suspects who
remain smear-negative. Culture and sputum induction can increase
sensitivity of diagnosis. Before diagnosing smear-negative PTB,
consider alternative diagnoses such as:
Pneumonia.
Asthma.
Chronic bronchitis.
Non-TB respiratory complications of HIV infection.
Bronchiectasis.
Lung abscess.
Lung cancer.
In some TB programmes, a decision to start treatment for smearnegative PTB can only be made by a doctor or individual with
particular expertise in TB.

Tuberculin skin testing (TST)
This is a test for infection with M. tuberculosis; it cannot by itself be
used to diagnose active TB. It relies on the fact that cell-mediated
hypersensitivity typically develops within 8 weeks after infection with
M. tuberculosis. Following intradermal injection of PPD (purified
protein derivative), the diameter of skin induration (swelling, not
redness) is measured at 48-72 h. Training and experience in
interpreting skin test responses is critical to achieving accurate
results. In most situations, 10 mm of induration to a standard
tuberculin dose is the cut-off between negative and positive; 5 mm is
considered positive in HIV-infected individuals. Both false negative and
false positive TST results are relatively common (see box). The larger

the area of induration, the less likely it is to be a false positive. New Tcell-based assays using blood samples eliminate most false positives
encountered with the TST, but are costly, and their role in clinical
practice is still being determined.

Uses of the TST
Epidemiologic — determining prevalence or incidence of M.
tuberculosis infection in a population or specific group e.g. health
care workers.
Diagnostic — to aid in assessing the likelihood of TB as the cause of a
clinical illness. In high-prevalence countries, this use is largely
limited to children because the ‘background’ prevalence of
incidental TST positivity in the general population increases with
age.
Identification of candidates for ‘chemoprophylaxis’ (e.g. paediatric
contacts of pulmonary TB patients, HIV-infected individuals).

A false positive TST can be caused by
BCG: TST response following BCG is variable; BCG in infancy is
unlikely to account for a strongly positive TST in adulthood.
Exposure to environmental mycobacteria.
Incorrect interpretation.

A false negative TST can be caused by
Normal variation.
Long interval since infection.
Reduced cell-mediated immune response (HIV, old age,
corticosteroid therapy, measles, malnutrition).
Severe illness, including overwhelming TB.
Incorrect TST technique or interpretation.

Treatment

Aims of treatment
To cure the patient, preserve life, and prevent disability.
To prevent transmission.
To prevent development of resistant TB.

Principles of anti-TB therapy
The right drugs: treatment must always include a minimum of 2
drugs to which the organism is sensitive.
The right duration: generally 6-8 months for drug-sensitive TB.
Assured adherence — the TB programme must ensure that each
patient completes the full course of therapy.

Treatment supervision
Directly observed therapy (‘DOT’) was initially intended to mean
observed swallowing of each dose by a health care worker. Because
this may not be feasible in all settings, a range of alternative
supervision strategies have been suggested, tried, and appear to have
been successful, at least in small projects. Treatment supervisors have
included teachers, employers, community-chosen volunteers, ex-TB
patients, and, more controversially, family members. If any of these
strategies for treatment supervision are used, there must be adequate
provision for selection, training, and regular monitoring of the
treatment supervisor, a reliable mechanism for delivery of drugs,
proper record keeping, and rigorous monitoring of treatment
outcomes.

Drug dosage and standard regimens
(see box)
Standard TB treatment and duration appears to be effective regardless
of disease site, although some authorities recommend prolonging the
consolidation phase for TB meningitis and bone disease (up to 12

months total). Preferably, TB drugs should be provided in the form of
fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets which make monotherapy
impossible and provide an extra defence against the development of
drug resistance.
Most national TB programmes have a standard regimen and a retreatment regimen — the latter for patients who have defaulted,
failed treatment, or relapsed after initially successful treatment.

Anti-TB drugs
Isoniazid (INH; ‘H’): potent anti-TB activity. Main serious adverse
effect is liver toxicity; can cause peripheral neuropathy.
Rifampicin (rifampin in North America; ‘R’): essential to the
success of modern short course (<12 months) TB therapy. Major
drug interactions with warfarin, anticonvulsants, oral
contraceptives, some antiretrovirals, etc. Less commonly
hepatotoxic than Z or H.
Pyrazinamide (‘Z’): ‘sterilizing’ activity allows treatment courses
of 6 months. Contribution to 1st-line regimens limited largely to
the first 2 months of therapy. May cause arthralgias; most
hepatotoxic 1st line TB drug.
Ethambutol (‘E’): weak anti-TB agent; main role is prevention of
resistance to other drugs. Main serious adverse effect is ocular

toxicity, which is uncommon at recommended doses.
Thiacetazone (‘T’): weak anti-TB agent formerly used in
conjunction with isoniazid in the continuation phase. Largely
abandoned in high HIV-prevalence countries because of high rates
of Stevens-Johnson syndrome in HIV-co-infected patients.
Streptomycin (‘S’): now limited to 2nd-line or re-treatment
regimens because of the desire to avoid unnecessary injections in
the HIV era. Ototoxicity (vertigo > hearing loss) and renal toxicity
are the main adverse effects. The drug should be avoided or
dosage adjusted carefully in renal dysfunction. Contraindicated in
pregnancy.

Special groups
Isoniazid causes peripheral neuropathy more commonly in
diabetic, malnourished, alcoholic, and pregnant patients, and in
those with pre-existing neuropathy including those with HIV. Give
pyridoxine 10-15 mg/d to protect against peripheral neuropathy.
Women on oral contraceptives must use another form of
contraception (e.g. an IUD) during rifampicin therapy and for 4-8
weeks after stopping rifampicin.
Pregnancy: TB drugs, except for streptomycin, may be used in
pregnancy. Any theoretical risks to the foetus are much less than
the risks from untreated TB.

First-line regimen (WHO) 2HRZE 4HR or 2HRZE
4H3R3
Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol od for 2
months.
Followed by a ‘continuation phase’ of isoniazid and rifampicin either
od (4HR) or 3x/week (4H3R3) for 4 months.

First-line regimen (International Union Against

Tuberculosis and Lung Disease) 2HRZE 6HE
Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol od for 2
months.
Followed by isoniazid and ethambutol od for 6 months.
This regimen has been shown to have somewhat lower efficacy and
would be chosen mainly in situations where adequate supervision
during the continuation phase was not deemed possible.

‘Re-treatment regimen’ (defaulters, treatment
failure, relapse) 2HRZES 1HRZE 5H3R3E3
Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin
od for 2 months.
Followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol od for
1 month.
Then isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol 3x/week for 5 months.
It is increasingly recognized that this regimen is suboptimal in patients
who have failed fully supervised first-line therapy, but at the moment,
no fully satisfactory or generally accepted alternative exists for lowincome country settings.

Monitoring treatment:
sputum-positive patients should be monitored by sputum smear
examination after 2 months of treatment and at least one other time
prior to treatment completion. All other patients should be monitored
clinically.

Education:
regarding adverse drug reactions is essential. Of particular
importance, every patient should be advised to present to a clinic or
hospital immediately if jaundice is noted.

Treatment adherence:
Good adherence is the most important determinant of successful
treatment. As patients feel better after starting treatment, their
motivation to continue therapy for many months is naturally likely to
wane. It is the responsibility of the treating health care worker and
the TB programme to ensure that patients complete TB therapy. The
patient and community must be well informed and aware, specifically,
of the risks of drug resistance. The relationship between the patient
and programme or clinic staff is a major factor promoting adherence.
Practical measures such as clinic hours which can accommodate
working patients are very important. Individualized approaches to the
specific problems of individual patients at increased risk of defaulting
are the hallmark of a committed and successful programme staff.
These could include help with transportation, nutritional support,
addiction treatment, home visits, etc. Early identification and tracing
of defaulters is an essential function of a TB programme.

A ‘therapeutic trial’ of treatment
A therapeutic trial is widely used in many settings to diagnose TB.
This strategy has not been validated, is not recommended by WHO,
and risks creating confusion in a TB programme. If a ‘therapeutic
trial’ is to be used:
All efforts to make a diagnosis should have been exhausted.
An objective indicator (e.g. fever) of success and the planned trial
duration (fever resolves within 14 days of starting treatment in
most cases) should be established before starting the trial.
Preferably, the drugs used for the trial should have
antimycobacterial activity (isoniazid, ethambutol, and
pyrazinamide) but not be effective against other infections
(rifampicin and streptomycin).
The trial patient should be clearly distinguished from other
patients in the TB programme records.

TB and HIV
TB incidence has increased up to 6-fold in communities severely
affected by the HIV pandemic. Up to 80% of TB patients in these
settings are HIV +ve. Among patients with HIV infection, TB is the most
common cause of death globally. The mechanism underlying the
powerful interaction between these two diseases is the suppression, by
HIV infection, of the cell-mediated immune response (CD4+ helper Tcells and macrophages) to TB.

Chemoprophylaxis or treatment of latent TB
infection
The risk of developing active TB in the future, among HIV +ve, TST +ve
individuals is markedly reduced by ‘chemoprophylaxis’ with isoniazid
for 6-9 months. This benefit declines over time, especially if the
patient lives in a community where the risk of re-infection is high. In
practice, it has proven difficult to implement this intervention on a
large scale in a low-income country. Any use of TB drugs must be
strictly managed to avoid promoting resistance. Antiretrovirals are
very effective in reducing the risk of TB in HIV +ve patients (by
preventing CD4 decline).

HIV testing of TB patients:
There is increasing agreement that all TB patients should be
encouraged to undergo HIV testing. TB programmes should be prepared
to offer testing and coordinate follow-up and support with the HIV
programme.

Management of TB in HIV +ve patients
Most patients presenting with HIV-related TB do not know their HIV
status. Some will have clinical features of HIV infection such as oral
candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, skin and hair changes, peripheral
neuropathy, herpes zoster scars, etc. However, since TB can occur
early during the course of HIV disease, these clinical features of HIV
are more often absent.

Extrapulmonary TB is common in HIV +ve patients, particularly
lymphadenopathy, pleural and pericardial effusions, miliary TB, and
meningitis. However, PTB remains the most common form of disease.
The radiographic appearance of PTB in HIV-infected patients is often
atypical, depending on the individual's degree of immune suppression.
HIV +ve patients less commonly have upper lobe disease and cavities
and, more commonly, have intrathoracic adenopathy, effusions, and
miliary shadowing.

Diagnosis:
Sputum smear microscopy remains the primary investigation, but is
somewhat less sensitive in HIV +ve patients. If the smear is negative,
the differential diagnosis of lung disease in the HIV +ve patient
includes:
Bacterial (most often pneumococcal) pneumonia: a short history and
a response to antibiotic therapy is suggestive.
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP; previously known as
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia): characteristic features include
severe dyspnoea and hypoxia, diffuse changes on X-ray, absence of
effusions, and a response to high-dose co-trimoxazole therapy.
Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma: most patients have cutaneous or oral
lesions.

Treatment regimens
TB drug treatment regimens are the same in HIV +ve and uninfected
patients. Cure rates are similar provided standard rifampicincontaining regimens are used. Recurrence rates are higher in the HIV
+ve, at least partly due to the increased rate of reinfection. Mortality
during and after treatment is markedly increased among patients with
HIV, mainly due to HIV-related causes other than TB.
Increasing numbers of patients in low-income countries have access to
antiretroviral therapy (ART). Treatment with ART and TB drugs at the
same time creates the potential for a variety of complex and

challenging problems:
Adverse effects which could be due to either TB or ART drugs and
which could result in treatment interruption.
Complex, clinically important drug interactions, particularly
involving rifampicin and protease inhibitors.
Immune reconstitution reactions (IRIS, see Chapter 3).
Knowledge in this area is evolving rapidly; participation of someone
with current knowledge and expertise in HIV/TB management is highly
desirable.
An immune reconstitution reaction (or immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome, IRIS) is most likely to occur in a patient with
a very low initial CD4 cell count or clinical evidence of profound
immune suppression. It may occur days to months after the ART
initiation. The mechanism is thought to involve an enhanced
inflammatory reaction to a pre-existing opportunistic infection
(especially TB) as cell-mediated immunity improves in response to
ART. The reaction is usually characterized by fever and localized
appearance or worsening of the opportunistic disease process e.g.
enlarging lymph nodes or worsening pulmonary infiltrate. Treatment
failure or a second complicating infectious process must be excluded
as far as possible, before arriving at a diagnosis of IRIS. Corticosteroids
(prednisolone 40-60 mg/day) are usually recommended for severe
manifestations of IRIS.
Patients taking ART prior to the diagnosis of TB should continue on it
when TB treatment is started, but may require modifications in the
ART regimen to ensure compatibility with rifampicin. In patients not
taking ART at the time of TB diagnosis, starting TB treatment is the
first priority. In general, the indications for ART in TB patients are
similar to those in patients without TB — patients with CD4 counts <
200 cells/mm3 or with clinical features of advanced HIV disease are
eligible for ART. The timing of ART initiation, however, is unclear. Most
experts would advise waiting 4-8 weeks after starting TB treatment.
A regimen consisting of efavirenz plus 2 nucleoside analogues (e.g.
lamivudine and stavudine) if otherwise appropriate, is currently the

best established regimen for patients receiving simultaneous ART and
TB therapy which includes rifampicin. (Note: efavirenz is
contraindicated in pregnancy.)
Patients receiving a non-rifampicin-containing continuation phase (HE)
can be given any otherwise appropriate ART regimen.
HIV-infected TB patients should receive long-term prophylaxis with
cotrimoxazole.

HIV & TB
In HIV +ve patients, by comparison with HIV -ve patients:
The incidence of TB is markedly increased.
The clinical & radiographic presentation may be different.
TB treatment is the same and cure rates are similar.
Recurrence is more frequent and mortality is more frequent.
Concomitant ART complicates TB treatment substantially.

Drug resistance and multi-drug resistant (MDR)
TB
Development of acquired drug resistance in a TB patient requires 2
steps: 1) a random mutation in the TB bacillus conferring resistance to
that drug, followed by 2) selection ‘pressure’ from the use of that drug.
The resistant organisms will then replicate more rapidly than drugsensitive organisms, unless suppressed by the use of one or more other
effective TB drugs. Once an organism has acquired resistance, the
resistant strain can be transmitted to another individual who will then
have primary drug resistance, even if he or she has never taken TB
drugs. Fundamentally, the cause of drug resistance is inadequate
treatment due to a failure of the TB programme. Conversely, TB drug
resistance is almost entirely preventable by a TB programme which
assures adequate adherence to effective therapy.
The definition of MDR TB is resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin ±
other drugs (see treatment, below).

Third-line anti-TB drugs; treatment of MDR TB
Recently, some programmes have implemented treatment of MDR TB.
Treatment of MDR TB is much longer (>18 months), much more toxic,
much more costly, and considerably less effective than treatment of
drug-sensitive TB, re-emphasizing the critical importance of
preventing resistance. MDR treatment should only be introduced in
settings where a DOTS programme is established and demonstrating
good outcomes. MDR TB treatment (‘DOTS Plus’) requires supervision
of treatment for 18 months, specialized medical expertise, a wellstructured programme and guidelines, appropriate laboratory and
culture resources, and an assured supply of 3rd line drugs. Expert

advice and drugs at reduced cost can be obtained through the WHO
‘Green Light Committee’ by programmes which meet its standards.
Suggested regimens for various patterns of drug resistance (assuming
access to culture and sensitivity studies) can be found at:
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab16
(table 16).

Extensively drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis
XDR is defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid plus
resistance to any quinolone plus resistance to at least one
injectable second line agent (capreomycin, amikacin, kanamycin).
For some years, such strains have been known to exist in Asia, the
Americas, and Europe. Of 17,000 TB isolates collected from around
the world between 2000-2004, 2% of MDR strains were also XDR,
being most frequently found in eastern Europe, western Asia and
South Korea. Population-based data from the USA, Latvia, and South
Korea revealed that 4%, 19%, and 15% of MDR strains, respectively,
were XDR. A large outbreak of XDR-TB amongst HIV infected people
recently occurred in South Africa that was associated with almost
100% mortality.

TB control programmes
TB control programmes require a structure, usually extending up to the
national level, that coordinates programme elements such as regimens
and protocols, training, drug supply, lab quality assurance, and
monitoring of programme outcomes.
Smear-positive PTB patients are the main source of TB transmission.
Detecting and curing infectious cases is the most effective means of
reducing new infections.
The first priority of a TB programme is to achieve a high rate of
treatment success, since treating cases badly can promote drug
resistance. Once a TB programme is achieving good treatment
outcomes (>85% treatment success), the next priority is to improve
case finding. This activity must be integrated with the primary health

care service since it depends upon recognition and appropriate
investigation (mainly sputum smear examination) of symptomatic TB
suspects presenting to 1° health care workers.
Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine derived
from M bovis. Protective efficacy ranges from 0 to 80% for reasons
which remain controversial. BCG provides some protection against
miliary TB and TB meningitis in children, and should be given at birth
to all children in high TB-prevalence countries (except those with
symptomatic HIV disease). BCG appears to have little or no impact on
the overall incidence or transmission of TB in a community.

Household and close contacts of TB cases:
symptomatic contacts should be sought out and investigated for active
TB — a particularly efficient form of case finding. Chemoprophylaxis
should be given to household contacts of smear-positive PTB patients
aged <5 years after an assessment to rule out active TB.
In high HIV-prevalence countries, both HIV prevention and
antiretroviral treatment are likely to reduce TB incidence. Ultimately,
poverty reduction with improved housing and nutrition may be the
most definitive TB control measures.

Symptoms of respiratory disease
Cough
An acute cough usually requires no investigation or treatment, but a
persistent cough associated with phlegm, fever, dyspnoea, or chest
pain warrants further investigation. A change in the pattern of any
longstanding cough is significant, especially in smokers.

Common causes of cough
Viral URTIs and LRTIs.
Asthma (can be without wheezing).
Pneumonia (including atypical pneumonias).
TB (including involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes).
Pleural effusion.

Drugs — (ACE inhibitors and beta blockers).
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease(GORD).
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Acute or chronic sinusitis, with a post nasal drip.
Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE).
Bronchiectasis.
Nocturnal coughing is a feature of asthma, left ventricular failure,
TPE, and GORD.
Most causes of cough can be diagnosed by physical examination, a
blood count, ESR, spirometry, and a chest X-ray.

Haemoptysis
Haemoptysis should always be taken seriously and patients should be
placed under close observation and investigated. Only a very careful
history can differentiate haemoptysis from haematemesis,
oropharyngeal bleeding, or a posterior epistaxis, and sometimes it
needs to be witnessed to be sure. Patients with haemoptysis will
continue to expectorate blood for 24 h after the acute event.
Severe haemoptysis is an emergency — maintain a clear airway, as
patients die of aspiration rather than exsanguination.

Common causes of haemoptysis
TB, bronchiectasis, mitral stenosis, carcinoma of the bronchus, acute
pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (with infarction), acute bronchitis.

Other causes of haemoptysis
Infections: lung abscess, parasitic disease (e.g. paragonimiasis),
fungal disease (e.g. aspergillosis), pleuro-pulmonary amoebiasis,
leptospirosis.
Trauma: lung contusions, foreign body aspiration, post endotracheal
intubation or following aggressive endotracheal suctioning.

Diffuse pulmonary parenchymal disease: Goodpastures syndrome,
Wegeners granulomatosis, systemic vasculitides.
Cardiovascular disease: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary
hypertension, aortic aneurysm.
Bleeding tendency: sepsis, DIC, snake bite, haemorrhagic fevers.

Dyspnoea/breathlessness
Look for anaemia, wheezing (may have both pulmonary and cardiac
causes), signs of LVF, and note the pattern of breathing. In most
instances, a CXR, ECG, and blood count will suffice to guide
appropriate investigations and treatment. Distinguish dyspnoea from
tachypnoea associated with voluntary hyperventilation, metabolic
acidosis, and thyrotoxicosis.

Diagnosis
Pulmonary: often associated with wheezing or chest pain — consider
asthma, COPD, pleural effusions, pneumothorax, interstitial lung
disease and pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary
hypertension, severe and extensive pneumonia, interstitial
pneumonia (e.g. Legionella, PCP, or CMV).
Cardiac: often with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, orthopnoea, or
ankle oedema — inability to lie flat is a crucial observation. LVF due
to valvular or ischaemic heart disease or myocardial disease due to
myocarditis or cardiomyopathy are the usual causes.
Diseases of the chest wall: severe kyphoscoliosis, Guillan Barre
syndrome, neurotoxic snake envenoming, myasthenia gravis,
ankylosing spondylitis, hypokalemia, etc.
Anaemia: if acute or if chronic and severe.

Wheeze/stridor
Wheezes are (generally expiratory) ‘coo-ing’ sounds coming from the
larger airways. Wheezes may vary in pitch and intensity and can be
heard at the mouth in some patients. A localized wheeze may be due

to partial endobronchial obstruction. Stridor is a harsh sound heard in
inspiration due to obstruction of the trachea or larynx by a foreign
body or tumor.

Causes of wheezing
All causes of airways obstruction — asthma, COPD (often
exacerbated by infection or use of beta blockers).
Left ventricular failure — peribronchial oedema causes
bronchospasm and wheezing.
Inhalation of toxic chemicals.
Endobronchial obstruction from a tumour or foreign body (localized
wheeze).
Multiple causes of a wheeze may exist in a single patient.

Pneumonia
Pneumonia kills ~3 million children per year in the developing world
and affects adults of all ages. While pneumonia may occur as part of a
severe systemic viral infection (esp. measles or influenza), most
serious cases are bacterial. CXR or clinical findings do not reliably
differentiate between bacterial or viral agents.

Aetiology
Many organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, depending on the
patient's age, season of the year, and the presence of other diseases
(see box). It is often impossible to obtain microbiological confirmation;
hence the choice of antibiotics should always cover the most likely
causes. Consider factors which help determine the likely cause and
severity, and guide the patient's management. Also establish the
immunization history of the patient.
Where was the pneumonia acquired — community or hospital?
Was the patient previously healthy (1° pneumonia)? or chronically ill
(2° pneumonia)?

Are risk factors for pneumonia present including: malnutrition,
pregnancy, HIV infection, diabetes, underlying chronic disabilities
impairing lung function (e.g. cerebral palsy), periods of
unconsciousness (alcohol, epilepsy, surgical patients), absence of a
functioning spleen (post-splenectomy or due to sickle cell disease).

Clinical features
The patient is systemically ill with malaise, fever, anorexia, body
aches, and headache. Delirium can occur in severe infections. In
children, symptoms can be less specific and include abdominal pain,
vomiting, refusal of feeds.
Respiratory signs and symptoms include raised respiratory rate
(note: this is age-dependent — see box), nasal flaring, intercostal
and subcostal recession, tracheal tug, cough, sputum production,
dyspnoea, pleural pain, and, rarely, haemoptysis. Chest movements
might be reduced on the affected side; inspiratory crackles and
pleural rub may be present on auscultation. After a few days, an
effusion often occurs. Sputum is often initially scanty or absent,
becoming purulent or blood-streaked later in the infection. Children
tend to swallow their secretions/sputum, so the absence of sputum
production does not exclude pneumonia.
Lower lobe pneumonia with diaphragmatic pleurisy may mimic an
acute abdomen — abdominal pain, ileus, rigidity.
In the very young, elderly, or debilitated, there may be fewer signs.
Look for raised respiratory rate and perform a careful chest
examination.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
In a previously healthy person with community-acquired pneumonia,
the most likely pathogens are S. pneumoniae and, less often, atypical
organisms. TB should also be considered, especially if the response to
antibiotics is poor. Consider whether the patient is:
Previously healthy or had chronic lung disease. The latter condition
predisposes to colonization e.g. with H. influenzae.
Generally debilitated, an alcoholic, or an intravenous drug abuser.
These patients are commonly infected by gram-negative bacteria
and also at increased risk of TB and pneumococcal infection.
Aspiration pneumonia may occur in those who have alcohol or drug
habits, or reduced conciousness (e.g. head injury or epilepsy). Mouth
and gum flora from poor dental hygiene includes anaerobes —
causing pneumonia which often progresses to a lung abscess (see
below).

Common bacterial causes of CAP
(see box p. 167)
Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Haemophilus influenzae type B occurs particularly in children <5 yrs
old who often present with lobar pneumonia, pleural involvement,
and an effusion. It also occurs in adults both as a primary infection
and in previously damaged lungs. The onset is slower than the other
bacteria. The pneumonia is often accompanied by infection
elsewhere (e.g. meninges, epiglottis). The use of the Hib vaccine in
the tropics should markedly reduce its incidence, if the vaccine can
be afforded.
Staphylococcus aureus can cause pneumonia in patients with preexisting chronic or acute lung disease, particularly following viral
infection, usually influenza or especially measles. Note that the
influenza infection may be subclinical. Alternatively, haematogenous
spread from a distant site of infection (e.g. skin, bones and joints, or
heart) may produce pneumonia in a previously healthy lung. In these

circumstances, S. aureus may be isolated from blood. It is always a
serious condition with high fever and cyanosis; common
complications include pulmonary abscess formation, cavitation,
empyema.

A poor prognosis is associated with
Presence of bacteraemia (e.g. the fatality rate increases from 5% in
isolated S. pneumoniae pneumonia to 25-35% fatality rate when the
bacillus is cultured from blood).
Infections with S. aureus, H. influenzae, and gram -ve bacteria.
Previous illness, either chronic (e.g. COPD, cardiac disease,
malnutrition) or acute (influenza, measles).

Clinical features
Confusion/sepsis
Respiratory rate >30/min (Note: age-dependent see opposite)
Diastolic BP <60 mmHg

Investigations
Blood urea >7 mmol/l
WCC <4 × 109/l or >30 × 109/l
Arterial PO2 <8 kPA
Serum albumin <25 g/l
Multilobe involvement

Pneumococcal pneumonia
Streptococcus pneumoniae
causes 25-50% of ARIs in children admitted to hospital and >1 million
deaths/yr in children. It is most common in crowded communities with

poor living conditions. Adults with debilitating diseases (e.g. diabetes,
HIV, alcoholism, asplenia, hypogammaglobinaemia) are at increased
risk of pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease. Streptococcus
pneumoniae has progressively become less sensitive to penicillin: >50%
of pneumococcal isolates in some countries have reduced sensitivity to
penicillin. Many isolates also have reduced sensitivity to other
common antibiotics such as tetracycline. Currently, the prevalence of
penicillin-resistant pneumococci in many parts of the developing world
is unknown.

Transmission:
person-person via droplet spread. Long-term nasopharyngeal carriers
of S. pneumoniae are common. Local spread to ear or meninges
(particularly after head trauma) can produce otitis media or
meningitis.

Clinical features:
sometimes following an URTI, there is a sudden onset of fever, rigors,
malaise, headache, and myalgia. At the extremes of age, onset is often
less clear — children show tachypnoea in addition to fever and cough,
while the elderly may have little fever and present with confusion.
Chest pain (pleuritic, sometimes referred to shoulder if diaphragm is
involved) and cough (initially painful and dry → blood-tinged →
purulent) commonly follow. Lower lobe involvement can result in
abdominal pain and guarding. The WCC is often raised; leukopenia is a
poor prognostic sign.

Complications:
pneumococci in the lungs may spread directly to the pleura, where a
reactive effusion may already be present, producing a complicated
parapneumonic effusion or an empyema (see below). Haematogenous
spread can result in infection of meninges, joints, eyes, or abscess
formation in distant organs. Rare complications include: acute
septicaemia in patients with underlying conditions, such as asplenia;
endocarditis; peritonitis in patients with lowered immunity; and

ascites (nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis).

Diagnosis:
mainly clinical; bacteria can be cultured from sputum or blood; or by
aspiration of abscesses in distant organs.

Management:
follow local guidelines if local antibiotic sensitivities are known. If not
known, use empiric antibiotics (see box p. 173).

Prevention:
protein-conjugate vaccines are increasingly used (see Chapter 22).
Seek to improve underlying health problems e.g. smoking, untreated
HIV infection.

Atypical pneumonia
‘Atypical’ organisms cause <10% of all pneumonias in developing
countries. Of those, common causes are Mycoplasma pneumoniae and
Chlamydia pneumoniae. Others include C. trachomatis and C. psittaci,
Coxiella burnetti, Legionella pneumophila, and viruses such as
influenza and adenovirus. These organisms are difficult to culture and
diagnosis is clinical, supported by CXR, blood picture, serology, or
nasopharyngeal aspirate (if available). Atypical pneumonia affects
previously healthy individuals of all ages. Symptoms are dyspnoea, dry
cough, fever, and malaise. Localizing features (pleuritic chest pain,
splinting, and respiratory distress) are rare. The CXR often shows
bilateral, fluffy infiltrates, and appears worse than the clinical signs
would suggest; the WCC can be normal, but hyponatraemia, elevated
liver transaminases, proteinuria, and renal impairment are common.
The clinical course is normally benign; occasionally it is severe and
requires ICU admission.

Legionnaires' disease
The importance of Legionella pneumophila in the tropics is unknown. It

is transmitted by inhalation of aerosolized water droplets from air
conditioning systems, water storage tanks, showerheads, and medical
equipment such as nebulizers.

Clinical features:
vary from subclinical or mild infections to severe pneumonia. In severe
infection, after 2-10 days, there is abrupt high fever, rigors, myalgia,
and headache followed by the onset of a dry cough, dyspnoea, and
crackles on auscultation. The patient becomes very ill, appearing
toxic, sometimes with delirium or diarrhoea. Complications include
respiratory failure, pericarditis, myocarditis, and acute renal failure.
CXR shows homogeneous shadowing, often basal initially, subsequently
widespread with deterioration.

Diagnosis:
gram -ve slender rods of variable length in biopsy or sputum samples;
bacterial antigen in urine for first 1-3 weeks.

Management:
erythromycin 0.5-1 g/6 h IV or PO (± rifampicin 600 mg bd,
moxifloxacin 400 mg od, or ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd) for 2-3 weeks.

Prevention:
treatment and maintenance of stored water and tanks to prevent
bacterial colonization and spread.

Recurrent pneumonia
Defined as more than two episodes of pneumonia, it may be caused by:
Localized respiratory disease — bronchiectasis, bronchial obstruction
(foreign body, bronchial carcinoma, lymphadenopathy, bronchial
stenosis), intrapulmonary sequestration.
Generalized respiratory disease — COPD ± bronchiectasis, impaired
local defences.

Non-respiratory problem — recurrent aspiration, immunosuppression.
Acquired immunodeficiency (recurrent pneumonia is a frequent
finding in HIV-infected children).

Nosocomial pneumonia
Definition:
pneumonia that occurs more than 48 h after admission to hospital.

Signs:
development of fever, increased WCC, purulent sputum, lung infiltrate
on CXR.

Risk factors:
ITU patients, increasing age, obesity, smoking, long pre-operative stay,
prolonged anaesthesia, intubation, abdominal/thoracic operations,
plus risk factors for aspiration pneumonia (see below).

Aetiology
Aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions — particularly of Gram -ve
bacteria and anaerobic bacteria that may colonize nasopharynx
during hospital stay. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and serious illness
predispose to such colonization.
Inhalation of bacteria from contaminated instruments — such as
ventilators, nebulizers, intubation and nasogastric tubes.
Haematogenous spread — e.g. from abdominal infection, infected
cannulae, or catheters left in situ for too long.

Prevention:
prevent smoking pre-operatively, encourage early mobilization. Good
hospital staff and respiratory equipment hygiene, and good general
infection control measures should decrease the risk. Chest

physiotherapy post-operatively may help decrease nosocomial
pneumonia.

Aspiration pneumonia
Risk factors:
impaired consciousness (e.g. alcoholics, epileptics), dysphagia, being
bed-bound, neuromuscular diseases, decreased ability to clear
bronchial secretions or cough after general anaesthesia or
abdominal/thoracic surgery.

Aetiology
In the community — anaerobes from oropharynx and teeth crevices
(normally penicillin-sensitive).
In hospital — aerobic bacteria become more important, particularly
Gram -ve enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa.
It may be possible to diagnose anaerobic infection from a history of
poor dental hygiene, aspiration, or impaired consciousness. In
children, also consider gastro-oesophageal reflux and underlying
neurological/neuromuscular disorders. As the infection proceeds,
tissue necrosis results in foul-smelling purulent discharge.

Management of pneumonia
O2 — monitor saturation whenever possible; use paediatric probes
for children.
Antimicrobials: see below and box.
Analgesia for pleuritic pain.
Fluids (IV if necessary) to rectify dehydration and maintain an
adequate urine output (>1 ml/kg/hour). Remember that losses are
increased if the patient is febrile. In children, calculate volume
replacement carefully in ml/kg according to age and state of
hydration. Hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH is a common feature

of severe pneumonia.
Bed rest. The patient should sit up rather than lie flat — except in
cases of severe pneumonia where this may exhaust the patient.
Physiotherapy is not recommended in the acute stage of pneumonia;
useful when pleuritic pain has subsided.

Antimicrobial use: general points
If the patient is very ill, obtain culture specimens then immediately
begin empirical IV antibiotic therapy. Be aware of local guidelines
and, if possible, seek advice from a senior colleague. Empiric
antibiotic choice depends upon the clinical situation.
Only give IV therapy if the patient is very ill, cannot
swallow/vomits, or if the GI tract is not functioning. Use IV
antibiotics sooner in very young children, as disease progresses more
rapidly. It is often possible to switch to PO antibiotics after a few
doses IV.
Calculate antibiotic dosages according to weight in children.
Antibiotics can be given for 3-7 days in mild pneumonia. For severe
pneumonia, continue treatment according to the clinical response.
In the presence of cavitation and abscesses, continue treatment for
3-4 weeks.
Change the guidelines given in the box to reflect the most common
pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivities in your region.

Chest X-rays in pneumonia
CXRs are expensive and their interpretation subject to wide variation.
Therefore, the value of an CXR for each patient should be carefully
considered before ordering one. In particular:
Is the diagnosis already clear from the clinical features?
Will the CXR change the patient's management?
Note: CXR changes in pneumonia may take weeks to resolve following

successful treatment and clinical improvement by the patient.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
In 2002 and 2003 an unusual coronavirus was responsible for a large
number of cases of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which
had a high morbidity and mortality and spread rapidly across
continents from its origin in Guandong in China and Hong Kong.

Pathology
Coronaviruses commonly infect humans and cause the common cold.
The coronavirus strain causing SARS was previously unknown in humans
and was identified in civet cats and racoons from which human
transmission occurred as a result of ingestion. Following droplet
inhalation or ingestion, the coronavirus spreads to the bloodstream
and urine and causes severe pulmonary inflammation characterized by
desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and
oxygenation failure (ARDS). Mortality occurs in approximately 10-20%
of individuals, especially the elderly and those with pre-existing
cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Clinical features
Fever, cough, malaise, diarrhoea, myalgias, and headache occur after
an incubation period of 2-7 days. In many patients, the chest X-ray
shows infiltrates and patchy consolidation especially in the lower
zones. As the illness progresses, X-ray shadowing worsens along with
the development of ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction. Recovery may
be slow and some patients develop pulmonary fibrosis as a sequelae.
Diagnosis is based on the clinical sequence of events and the
appropriate setting. WHO criteria are regularly updated and should be
studied. Cultures of SARS-CoV are not possible in routine laboratories
and an RT-PCR may be useful on blood, urine, and sputum samples.
Rising antibody titres may be of help but are generally valuable only in

convalescence.

Management
No specific antiviral therapy, including ribavarin, is of value. Steroids
have been tried on account of a postulated immunopathological
mechanism but no benefit has been found. Supportive treatment in an
ICU setting is the best option.

Paediatric specific acute respiratory
infections

P.176

Epiglottitis
Epiglottitis is an acute bacterial infection of the epiglottis,
aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoid cartilages. It occurs mainly in
children aged 2-7 years and is almost always caused by Haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib). Following direct or haematogenous infection
of the upper airway, there is rapid swelling and risk of airway
obstruction. Hib conjugate vaccine substantially reduces the incidence
of life-threatening infections. However, many EPI programmes do not
include Hib immunization and severe disease also occurs where
immunization coverage is low. In older individuals, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, group A Streptococcus, and
Staphylococcus aureus may cause a similar illness.

Clinical features:
Typically starts suddenly and progresses rapidly. The affected child
presents with sudden onset of high fever, sore throat, and muffled
voice. Stridor, respiratory distress, and drooling of saliva follow. The
child appears toxic, refuses to eat or drink, and prefers to sit upright,
leaning forward in an effort to maintain patency of the airway. Other
associated symptoms include loss of voice (aphonia) and dysphagia.

Diagnosis:
Consider epiglottitis in any young child with compatible clinical

presentation, esp. if not immunized against Hib. Visualization of a
large, swollen, cherry-red epiglottis by direct laryngoscopy at the time
of endotracheal intubation confirms the diagnosis.

Management:
Epiglottitis is a medical emergency. The goals of management are
prevention of airway obstruction and eradication of infection.
Give humidified O2.
Make urgent arrangements for securing an artificial airway
(preferably nasotracheal), irrespective of the severity of respiratory
distress.
Be prepared to perform a tracheostomy if endotracheal intubation
fails.
Until the airway has been secured do NOT:
examine the throat (reflex laryngeal spasm may cause complete
airway obstruction).
attempt venepuncture (associated anxiety and pain may
precipitate acute laryngeal spasm).
send the child for an X-ray (immediate intervention will be
necessary if airway obstruction occurs).
Once definitive airway secured, take samples for FBC and cultures of
blood and epiglottic surface.
Give antibiotics: IV ceftriaxone or IV ampicillin and
chloramphenicol, for 7-10 days.
Note: adrenaline and corticosteroids are NOT effective in epiglottitis.
Once the airway is secured, most children improve rapidly with signs of
improved oxygenation and respiratory effort. The epiglottitis resolves
after a few days of antibiotics, and the patient can be weaned from
the endotracheal or nasotracheal tube.

Bacterial tracheitis
Presentation is similar to croup, but bacterial tracheitis may affect any
age group and does not respond to croup treatment. Unlike
epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis rarely causes airway obstruction.
Causes include S. aureus, group A streptococci, H. influenzae,
Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella species, other gram negatives, and
anaerobes. There is diffuse inflammation of the larynx, trachea, and
bronchi with formation of an adherent or semi-adherent mucopurulent
membrane in the trachea.

Clinical features:
include fever, bark-like/brassy cough, hoarseness, respiratory distress,
stridor, and sepsis.

Diagnosis:
is clinical supported by elevated WBC, CXR (which may show narrowing
of trachea), and blood culture. Direct visualization and culture of
purulent tracheal secretions by laryngotracheobronchoscopy is the only
means of definitive diagnosis.

Treatment:
involves airway management and administration of broad-spectrum
antibiotics. Affected children may decompensate acutely with
worsening respiratory distress and sepsis.

Acute laryngotracheobronchitis: croup
Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB; croup) is the most common form of
upper airway obstruction in childhood, usually occurring between 3
months and 5 years of age. The majority of cases are viral in origin.
LTB initially affects the mucosa of the nose and nasopharynx, then
spreads to involve larynx and bronchial tree. In young children, in
whom the subglottic mucosa is loosely attached, inflammation causes
submucosal oedema and narrowing of the airway.
Human parainfluenza viruses cause ~75% cases; other causes include
adenoviruses, RSV, influenza, and measles.

Clinical features:
LTB begins as a mild URTI with mild brassy cough, low-grade fever, and
intermittent stridor. Over the ensuing few days, progressive
compromise of the airway results in a characteristic sequence of
symptoms and signs: coughing increases, stridor becomes continuous (±
wheeze), and signs of respiratory distress develop, including nasal
flaring, suprasternal, intercostal, and subcostal recession (lower chest
wall indrawing), associated with a prolonged, laboured expiratory
phase of respiration. Symptoms are characteristically worse at night.
Crying and agitation aggravate symptoms and the child prefers to sit
up in bed or be held upright. Examination reveals reduced breath

sounds, wheezes, and crackles.
Most children improve spontaneously within 48-72 h but some progress
to severe airway compromise and, therefore, require further
intervention to avert death from respiratory failure. The croup score is
useful for the initial assessment of the child, as well as the evaluation
of the response to treatment.

Diagnosis:
is clinical.

Management
Indications for admission are listed in the box opposite.
Give humidified O2.
Give dexamethasone 150 mcg/kg IV/IM/PO or prednisolone 1-2
mg/kg PO or nebulized budesonide 2 mg stat; repeat at 12 h if
necessary.
Give IV fluids to children with moderate to severe respiratory
distress.
Ensure minimal disturbance as symptoms worsen on agitation.
Observe closely for signs of worsening airway obstruction.
If severe airway obstruction develops (cyanosis, air hunger,
restlessness), consider nebulized adrenaline (give 400 mcg/kg up to
max 5 mg, of 1 in 1000 (1 mg/ml) solution, repeated after 30 minutes
if required), ± tracheostomy or nasotracheal intubation.
Note:
Sedation is contraindicated in croup because it masks restlessness,
which is one of the principal clinical indices of the severity of airway
obstruction and the need for tracheostomy or nasotracheal
intubation.
Expectorants, bronchodilators, and antihistamines are not helpful in
the management of croup.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Indications for admission in a child with croup
include
worsening stridor or respiratory distress.
severe stridor at rest.
hypoxia or cyanosis.
restlessness, lethargy, or unconsciousness.
Managing milder episodes at home
Children with mild croup can be managed at home
but must be watched closely for signs of worsening
respiratory obstruction. Management is supportive.
Cool mist inhalation may help: this can be achieved
by placing the child in a bathroom filled with steam
from the shower or by taking the child outdoors in
the cool, night air.

Acute bronchiolitis
Acute bronchiolitis is common among children aged <2 years (peak 3-6
months). In >50% of cases it is caused by RSV; other causes include
adenoviruses, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma. The source of
infection is usually an older child or adult with a minor respiratory
illness. Risk factors for severe RSV bronchiolitis include low birth
weight, overcrowding, exposure to tobacco smoke, and a family
history of asthma. Exclusive breastfeeding offers some protection in
infancy.

Clinical features:
Characteristically begins as a URTI; the infant appears slightly unwell,
with low-grade fever, a blocked nose, serous nasal discharge, cough
and feeding difficulty. Within 24-48 h, the signs of airway obstruction
appear with paroxysmal wheezy cough, dyspnoea, and irritability.
Breast and bottle-feeding become difficult as the rapid respiratory rate
does not give enough time for sucking and swallowing. Examination
reveals tachypnoea, nasal flaring, intercostal and subcostal recession.
The chest is hyper-resonant with obliteration of the cardiac dullness
due to hyperinflation. Rhonchi and fine crepitations are heard on
auscultation. The liver and spleen may be palpable due to
hyperinflation. In mild cases, symptoms resolve over 1-3 days while
severe cases may run a more protracted course.

Diagnosis:
is primarily clinical, supported by CXR which may show hyperinflation
(flattening of the diaphragm) ± associated pneumonia.

Management:
is mainly supportive:
All children with respiratory distress should be hospitalized.
Keep propped up in bed (30-40° above horizontal).

Give humidified O2 via a nasal catheter.
Ensure adequate fluid intake.
Feed via NG tube.
Wheezing may respond to nebulized salbutamol.
Note:
Antibiotics are indicated for any associated pneumonia.
Corticosteroids are of no benefit in the management of bronchiolitis.

Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP)
The HIV pandemic has made LIP a common respiratory disorder; it
constitutes 22-75% of pulmonary disease in paediatric patients with
HIV, but is uncommon in adults. LIP also occasionally occurs in EBV
infection, HTLV infection, lymphoproliferative disorders, and
autoimmune disease. Pathologically, there is a pleomorphic lung
infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells and immunoblasts, with
activation of T cells and increased production of lymphokines.

Clinical features
May be asymptomatic in the early stages. Symptoms are usually
progressive and include:
Chronic cough.
Dyspnoea.
Parotid enlargement.
Generalized lymphadenopathy.
Hepatosplenomegaly.
Digital clubbing.
Wheezing.
± other features of the underlying immunosuppressive disease.

Diagnosis:
is clinical, supported by CXR
ABG may confirm hypoxia.
CXR findings include bibasilar interstitial or small nodular infiltrates
which coalesce into alveolar consolidation, widened mediastinum,
and peri-hilar adenopathy.
Serum LDH is often increased to 300-500 iu/L.
Tests for underlying disease, especially HIV.
Differential diagnoses include varicella pneumonia, miliary TB, and
metastatic carcinoma. Definitive diagnosis requires open lung biopsy
which is rarely performed in view of its attendant complications.

Treatment
Asymptomatic children require no treatment but should be followed up
for clinical and/or radiological signs of deterioration. For symptomatic
children:
O2.
Prednisolone 2 mg/kg PO daily; treat for 4 weeks then gradually
taper dose. Long-term steroid therapy may be required if symptoms
recur.
Bronchodilators may be used to treat children with wheeze.
Treat the underlying cause: anti-retroviral therapy for HIV infection.

Diphtheria
The Gram +ve bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae causes
infection of the naso-pharynx and occasionally skin and mucous
membranes. Its endotoxin has potentially fatal effects on the heart,
kidney, and peripheral nerves. Death occurs in 75% without treatment,
and in 5-10% despite treatment. Children <5 yrs and adults >40 yrs have
a worse prognosis. Although its incidence is falling worldwide, it

remains a significant problem in some developing countries where
vaccination programmes are unavailable.
Transmission is by droplets or secretions from infected humans (the
only reservoir). Incubation is 2-5 days. Patients are infectious for ~1
mth; however, some become carriers.

Clinical features
The incubation period is ~2-5 days (7 days for cutaneous diphtheria).
The patient may present with general non-specific symptoms,
including: fever and chills, malaise, sore throat, hoarseness and
dysphagia, wheezing, nausea and vomiting, headache.

Local:
mucosae are initially red and oedematous; this progresses to necrosis
of epithelium. An inflammatory grey-white pseudo-membrane forms at
the site of infection (commonly the tonsils and oropharynx); it is
adherent and separates with bleeding. There is fever, malaise, sore
throat (may cause dysphagia), cervical lymphadenopathy, and bad
breath. The neck is often swollen with oedema and enlarged lymph
nodes. Palatal paralysis by toxin produces a ‘nasal’ quality to the
speech.

Tracheo-laryngeal:
hoarsness, dry cough, and, rarely, airways obstruction.

Cutaneous:
this is rare. There are pustules and ulcers with a grey membrane.

Systemic effects of toxin:
myocarditis (10%), heart block (often >1 wk after acute infection; can
cause death up to 8 wks after), murmurs, heart failure. Neuronal
demyelination causes peripheral neuritis (often ~6 wks after initial
illness), paralysis (soft palate, ocular, and intercostals muscles). There

may be renal failure (tubular necrosis) and pneumonia.

Malignant diphtheria:
indicates rapid spread of membranes, neck oedema and adenitis,
stridor, and shock.

Diagnosis
Treat on suspicion — do not wait for confirmation. Arrange for throat
swabs of membrane, ECG (look for ectopics, ST and T wave changes,
RBBB, complete heart block), U&Es, FBC.

Treatment
Give antitoxin as soon as possible. A test dose of diluted diphtheria
antitoxin should 1st be given intradermally to exclude hypersensitivity;
then give 10,000-30,000 units IM for mild-moderate disease, and 40,000100,000 for severe disease (for children <10 yrs give half this dose). For
doses >40,000 units, give by IV infusion. Antitoxin is made from horse
serum, so beware anaphylaxis which is rare but potentially fatal. Have
adrenaline drawn up. Tracheostomy may be life-saving; do not delay if
there are signs of respiratory distress. Give high-dose antibiotics IV
(penicillin, erythromycin, cephalosporin, tetracycline are all
effective).

Prevention
Routine childhood vaccination prevents disease. Recovering patients
should also receive vaccine as a booster dose, as well as close
contacts. Immunity can be assessed by the Shick test.

Causes of sore throat and tonsillar exudates
Streptococcus pyogenes (sequelae are rheumatic heart disease
and glomerulonephritis).
Mild viral infections.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
Epstein-Barr virus — infectious mononucleosis.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
2° syphilis.
Herpes simplex virus — especially in AIDS patients.
Lassa virus.
Fusobacterium necrophorum (part of Lemierre syndrome).

Whooping cough
Bordetella pertussis commonly affects infants aged 2-4 yrs but can
cause illness and death at any age. Vaccination has reduced the
incidence but it is still a major problem in some countries.

Clinical features
The incubation period is 6-20 days. The first phase is indistinguishable
from the common cold and lasts 1-2 weeks. Fever is not usually
prominent.
Paroxysms of severe coughing with a ‘whoop’ are the classical feature.
The ‘whoop’ is caused by forced inspiration against a partly-closed
glottis and can cause cyanosis and hypoxic syncope. Infants <6 mths do
not whoop but become apnoeic. The child commonly drools and vomits
after coughing, and may become exhausted. Wheezing does not occur.
After 1-3 weeks of whooping, a more tolerable chronic cough may
persist for several weeks; adults and older children may have a chronic
cough throughout.
Many cases are uncomplicated and self-limiting; however, illness can
persist for weeks to months and result in bronchiectasis and
malnutrition. Prolonged coughing may produce petechiae, conjunctival
haemorrhages, and rectal prolapse. Death is usually due to severe
infection, 2° pneumonia, or encephalopathy — reduced consciousness
that is not due to hypoxia, seizures, or brain damage.

Diagnosis
Normally made clinically. The WCC shows a lymphocytosis. Culture is

difficult — a per-nasal swab is taken.

Management
Erythromycin is recommended, but its effect in modifying whooping
cough is weak. Nebulized beta-agonists and steroids are sometimes
used but generally have little effect because wheezing is not a
prominent feature.

Prevention
Routine immunization.

Pleural effusion

P.186

The presence of fluid in the pleural cavity. This is generally unilateral
but may be bilateral.
Exudates are inflammatory fluid collections caused by an underlying
infective/inflammatory disease. They are generally unilateral;
cellular pleocytosis is common, and protein content and fluid LDH
levels are generally high. Exudates have a straw-coloured
appearance and a high protein content (>50% of serum protein or >30
g/L).
Transudates are serous fluid collections that occur as a result of
passive flow across capillaries. They have a low protein content and
are generally bilateral; cellular pleocytosis is minimal. All oedemacausing conditions — CCF, nephrotic syndrome, liver cell failure,
anaemia, and hypoproteinaemia — may cause transudative pleural
effusions.
Chylothorax — the fluid appears milky on macroscopic appearance
and has a high lipid content. It is caused by leakage from the
thoracic duct due to damage by filariasis or a neoplastic process.
Empyema — the fluid contains frank pus.
Haemothorax — pure blood or heavily bloodstained fluid.

Clinical features:
Pleuritic chest pain is usually present if the pleura is acutely inflamed
— less common in TB (chronic inflammation). Patients are tachypnoeic
and may be dyspnoeic. Chest wall expansion is impaired on the
affected side and there is stony dullness to percussion with ↓ tactile
fremitus and ↓or absent breath sounds. Signs are commonly detected
at the bases posteriorly and in the mid-axillary line.

Diagnosis:
The presence of fluid is confirmed by CXR or ultrasound. Aspiration of
50-100 ml is generally done for diagnosis but in patients with
respiratory distress, 700-1000 ml is aspirated to relieve symptoms.
Fluid is best withdrawn posteriorly with the patient leaning forward
and the needle inserted one or two intercostal spaces below the upper
level of dullness. Fluid should be sent for routine biochemical
examination, pH, cytology, Gram and AFB staining, adenosine
deaminase (ADA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and
appropriate cultures.

Management:
Treat the cause of the effusion. Where the fluid is causing dyspnoea,
repeated aspirations or chest tube insertion may be beneficial. Where
recurrence is a problem, a pleurodesis may be performed.

Empyema
Pus in the pleural space is often a complication of a bacterial
pneumonia, pulmonary TB, aspiration pneumonia, or rupture of a liver
or lung abscess. A putrid odour indicates anaerobic bacterial infection.
An empyema should be suspected in any patient with persistent (often
high spiking) fever, with signs of fluid in the pleural space. Diagnosis is
established by the aspiration of pus from the pleural space and the
fluid obtained should be Gram stained and cultured. Broad-spectrum
antibiotics (suitable choices: co-amoxiclav; ceftriaxone; cefotaxime)
are indicated until the results of culture are obtained. Intercostal tube

drainage or a decortication may be required if a prolonged course of IV
antibiotics combined with repeated
ultrasound guided aspiration fails. A fluid pH <7.1 or high LDH level
(>60% of serum LDH or >1000) suggests an empyema is developing, and
needs to be drained.

Diagnostic features of pleural effusions
Exudates — protein >3.0 gms (with normal serum proteins), LDH
>200 i.u., fluid:serum LDH ratio >0.6.

Transudates — protein <3.0 gms, LDH <200, LDH ratio <0.6.
Increased ADA levels suggests TB.
Neutrophilia — bacterial pneumonias, empyemas.
Lymphocytosis — TB, lymphomas, viral infections.
Abnormal cytology — carcinomas, mesotheliomas.
Low pleural fluid sugar — RA, infections, malignancies.

Lung abscess
This is a suppurative infection of the lung parenchyma. It is commonly
caused by aspiration of mouth anaerobes and, less often, by bloodborne infection.

Clinical features
Patients present with a cough, fever with chills, chest pain, and
haemoptysis. Gingivitis with poor dentition, the usual source of the
bacteria, is often found. When the abscess communicates with a
bronchus, copious quantities of purulent sputum, often blood-streaked,
are expectorated. Clubbing develops rapidly and if the abscess
ruptures into the pleural space, an empyema will result. Chronic
abscesses with waxing and waning symptoms may result from
inadequate antibiotic therapy.

Diagnosis
Characteristically, the CXR shows a rounded opacity with an air-fluid
level. Multiple abscesses suggests a blood-borne infection e.g.,
infected pulmonary emboli or tricuspid endocarditis. Leukocytosis with
raised ESR and CRP are typical. Blood and sputum cultures help in
identification of the causative organism. If the abscess does not
resolve on antibiotics, bronchoscopy may be performed to seek an
endo-bronchial obstruction (foreign body, malignancy, bronchial
adenoma).

Management

IV antibiotics are mandatory until fever and leukocytosis settles. Coamoxiclav, clindamycin ceftriaxone, or cefuroxime are good initial
choices and may be modified according to cultures. Metronidazole may
be added for additional anaerobic cover and an antistaphylococcal
antibiotic such as flucloxacillin may be used in the appropriate setting.

Causes of lung abscesses
Pulmonary aspiration:
most occur in the right lung; aspiration while supine results in
abscesses in apical segment of the lower lobe or posterior segment
of the upper lobe. Often caused by anaerobes of gingival origin.

Bronchial obstruction:
due to lung CA or inhaled foreign body. Caused by mixed anaerobes.

Bacteraemia/septicaemia:
often multiple abscesses from sites such as right-sided endocarditis,
infected IV cannulae, IV drug abuse. Common causes are S. aureus,
Streptococcus milleri.

Primary infection with cavitation:
TB or as a complication of severe pneumonia with S. aureus,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Nocardia asteroides.

Spread from subphrenic or hepatic abscess:
produces 2° abscess, often in the right lower lobe. Due to
Entamoeba histolytica, coliforms, Streptococcus faecalis.

Immunosuppression:
such as malignancy, AIDS. Predisposes to unusual infections.

Cavitating lesions seen on CXR,
mimicking abscesses, may be caused by TB; paragonimiasis; fungal
infection; cavitating squamous cell CA; pulmonary infarction;
Wegener's granulomatosis.

Fungal pulmonary infections

P.190

Some fungi can infect the lung after inhalation of their spores, which

are found airborne and in soil and, in the case of histoplasmosis, bat
faeces. Human-human transmission does not appear to be a problem.
Accidental transmission may occur through the skin.
The infections depend on the immune status of the individual and the
level of exposure. While many cases are asymptomatic, illness may
present as:
Self-resolving pneumonitis (acute pulmonary form): cough, chest
pain, fever, joint pains, malaise, occasionally erythema nodosum or
multiforme. Specific therapy may be required in addition to bed
rest.
Localized cavitation: may be asymptomatic and found on CXR for
other reasons. No treatment is required. However, since they can be
similar to lung tumours, they may be diagnosed only at surgery.
Persisting or spreading cavitation: producing chest pain, cough, and
sometimes haemoptysis (which can be heavy). Surgery and
antifungal therapy may be required. These manifestations look
similar to, and can be mistaken for, pulmonary TB.
Acute or chronic systemic dissemination: to organs characteristic of
each infection. Patients present with fever, often marked weight
loss, skin lesions. If acute, there may be signs of lung disease and
purpura due to thrombocytopenia. Disseminated disease is fatal in
the absence of systemic antifungal therapy.
Moderate immunosuppression associated with diabetes predisposes to
spreading cavitation in some infections. Immunosuppression or
neoplasia predispose to acute disseminated disease. The elderly,
pregnant women, and children are also at increased risk of
disseminated disease.

Aspergillosis
Most infections are caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, or A.
niger in predisposed hosts. The fungus is ubiquitous; infection and
disease occur sporadically throughout the world.

Clinical forms and management
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (APBA): persistent
endobronchial infection/colonization elicits a chronic Type 1
hypersensitivity response in atopic individuals. This produces asthma
and, with time, a chronic cough (producing mucoid plugs) and
dyspnoea. CXR may show shadowing in the peripheral fields.
Eosinophilia is a feature. Manage with steroids. May lead to proximal
bronchiectasis.
Aspergilloma: a fungal ball that develops in a pre-existing cavity
(commonly due to TB). Intermittent cough is often the only sign but
haemoptysis may develop. If this is severe, the aspergilloma should
be surgically excised. CT scan appearances are distinctive.
Invasive disease: occurs in brain, kidney, liver, and skin of the
severely immunocompromised (e.g. bone marrow transplant
recipients). Attempt to reduce immunosuppression, if possible. Give
amphotericin B 1-1.5 mg/kg IV od, to a total dose of 2-2.5 g. This is a
toxic drug.

Diagnosis of Aspergillus infection
This is often difficult. Microscopic analysis of skin lesion scrapings,
sputum, or pus for evidence of fungal infection. Serology
(Aspergillus precipitins), specific fungal cultures. In disseminated
disease, yeasts may be seen in Giemsa-stained bone marrow. Skin
prick tests to Aspergillus and Aspergillus RAST test is useful in ABPA.
In acute fungal lung infections, the radiographic appearances may
give a clue, being typically more severe than expected from clinical
examination. Isolated chronic lung lesions (mycetomas) may only be
distinguished from lung tumours at surgery.

Histoplasmosis
This occurs in two forms and commonly affects HIV-infected patients:
Small-form histoplasmosis (caused by Histoplasma capsulatum var.
capsulatum) occurs in the Americas plus Africa and Asia. This gives

acute or chronic pulmonary infections, pericarditis, or progressive
disseminated histoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals.
Disseminated small-form histoplasmosis affects bone marrow, spleen,
liver, lymph nodes, and skin (papules, ulcers). A chronic form in
immunocompetent patients presents with persistent painful oral
ulceration and/or hypoadrenalism. Complications include laryngeal
ulceration, endocarditis, and meningitis.
Large-form or African histoplasmosis (H. capsulatum var. duboisii.)
occurs in central and west Africa. African histoplasmosis is either a
focal disease affecting bone, skin, and lymph nodes or a progressive
disseminated disease affecting mucosal surfaces, particularly the GI
tract and lungs.

Blastomycosis
A systemic infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis that occurs in
northern America, Africa, India, and Middle East. It causes chronic
pulmonary or disseminated disease (involving both lung and skin of
face and forearm). Skin lesions are commonly an initial single nodule,
then crusted plaques, ulcers, and abscesses. Complications include
lytic bone lesions (particularly axial skeleton) and GU tract disease
(particularly epididymitis).

Coccidioidomycosis
A disease of semi-arid regions of the Americas, caused by the fungus
Coccidioides immitis. It is inhaled into the distal airspaces, where it
rounds up and divides to form a large spherule with thick outer wall.
The clinical features are typically varied with dissemination occurring
particularly to meninges, joints, and skin.

Paracoccidioidomycosis
A granulomatous disease caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides
brasiliensis. It occurs sporadically in south and central America where
it is the most common systemic mycosis. An acute form of the disease
occurs in children and adults <30 yrs, while a chronic form is more
common in 30-50 year olds, particularly agricultural workers living in

endemic areas. The M:F ratio is ~10:1.
Acute form: presents with generalized lymphadenopathy, moderate
hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and weight loss over several months.
The nodes are hard but may become fluctuant. Involvement of
mesenteric and hepatic perihilar nodes may produce an appendicitislike picture or obstructive jaundice. Complications include lytic
bone lesions, small bowel disease, multiple mucocutaneous lesions
(lymphatic/ haematogenous spread). Pulmonary involvement is
uncommon. Immunosuppression can lead to severe superinfection
(e.g. TB, cryptococcus, pneumonia).
Chronic disease: normally presents with lung disease: dyspnoea,
cough, (rarely haemoptysis and fever), with extensive involvement
on CXR.
Mucocutaneous lesions are common on skin (face, limbs); painful
lesions in the mouth, pharynx, or oesophagus inhibit eating,
producing marked weight loss. Other features: ulcerated tongue,
hypoadrenalism. Chronic inflammation and fibrosis may result in
tracheal/laryngeal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and bowel
obstruction due to enlarged lymph nodes. Tumours may arise in the
skin or lung lesions.

Management of systemic fungal infections
Follow local guidelines
Am B (increase daily dose from 0.6 mg/kg/day to of 1.0-1.5
mg/kg/day, as renal function permits) to a cumulative total of at
least 15 mg/kg.
(Alternative: fluconazole 200-400 mg PO od for 6-18 months
depending on specific fungus)
Meningitis due to coccidioidomycosis requires fluconazole 400-600
mg PO od for 9-12 months.
Surgery may be required for management of chronic sequelae in
paracoccidioidomycosis.

Paragonimiasis (lung fluke disease)
A persistent lung disease, occurring widely around the globe, which is
caused by >15 different species of Paragonimus trematodes.

Transmission
Humans are infected by eating undercooked freshwater crabs and
crayfish infected with the metacercariae. The immature flukes burrow
out of the human intestine into the peritoneum, where they mature
and tunnel their way into the lungs. Here they cause inflammation,
haemorrhage, and necrosis of the lung parenchyma. Adult flukes
(stout, bean-shaped, ~1 cm long) live in cavities in proximity to
airways. Ova are expelled either in expectorated sputum or in the
faeces after being swallowed. Flukes that miss the lungs produce
extrapulmonary symptoms (due to cysts, granulomas, and abscesses) in
muscles, abdominal viscera, brain, genitalia.

Clinical features of paragonimiasis
Days-weeks after eating infected food, migration of the flukes within
the peritoneal and pleural cavities causes signs of inflammatory and
allergic responses — fever, rashes, urticaria, abdominal and chest pain
or discomfort.
The classic feature of chronic pulmonary disease is a persistent cough
with production of a thick brownish-red sputum (due to the presence of
ova and flukes). The CXR has features often resembling TB, except that
cavities are often basal. CXR changes may also include areas of
consolidation and pleural effusions. Physical examination of the chest
often reveals little and the patients appear quite well.
Aberrant migration of the flukes may produce signs of a cerebral SOL
(epilepsy, raised ICP, psychiatric syndromes, meningeal irritation) or
spinal SOL, necrosis of abdominal viscera, transitory subcutaneous
swellings. Extrapulmonary disease may occur in the absence of
pulmonary signs, but this is uncommon.

Diagnosis:
presence of ova or adult flukes in the sputum, faeces, or effusion;
serology.

Management:
praziquantel 25 mg/kg PO tds for 2-3 days often produces rapid
symptomatic improvement, although radiological changes may take
some months to improve.

Treatment:
of cerebral infection may result in neurological deterioration, in some
cases producing seizures and coma. Beware of raised ICP due to dying
parasites. Treat cautiously and consider using dexamethasone 4 mg IV
q6 h as cover.

Prevention:
improve health education to decrease consumption of undercooked
crustaceans; mass treatment of persons in endemic areas.

Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia

P.196

This acute or chronic lung syndrome occurs in areas where Bancroftian
filariasis is endemic. TPE is an amicrofilaraemic syndrome, resulting
from hypersensitivity to microfilarial antigens. In most instances, the
diagnosis is based on a therapeutic response to diethylcarbamazine
(DEC).

Pathology
Culex mosquitoes carry the larvae that mature into adult worms of
Wurchereria bancrofti and Brugiya malayi within lymphatics. Female
worms discharge millions of microfilaria many of which are trapped
and destroyed within the lungs eliciting an eosinophilic
hypersensitivity reaction.

Clinical features
Young adults are generally affected. Nocturnal cough associated with
wheezing may occur due to the nocturnal periodicity of
microfilaraemia. Low-grade fever, malaise, and weight loss may occur.
Wheezes and crackles are heard in severe or advanced cases, but in
many patients respiratory examination is normal. Significant
eosinophilia is typical with total eosinophil counts 3000-50,000/mm3.
Symptoms do not correlate with the degree of eosinophilia. Filarial
serology is positive but is unhelpful in endemic areas. CXRs may be
normal or show a reticulonodular appearance resembling milliary
mottling. In long-standing cases, features of pulmonary fibrosis are
seen. PFTs show a mixed restrictive and obstructive pattern with
diffusion abnormalities prominent in longstanding cases.

Management
Diethylcarbamazine 5 mg/kg daily in three divided doses × 3 weeks.
Patients who respond poorly should have a 2nd course of DEC for a
longer duration.

Asthma

P.198

Asthma is a disorder of the airways caused by chronic inflammation
and associated with reversible obstruction to the large or small
airways. It is often precipitated by environmental triggers, on a
background of genetic susceptibility. Triggers may be:
Allergens e.g. dust, food, pets etc. in atopic individuals.
Infections, especially viral in children e.g. RSV.
Environmental or occupational pollutants such as smoke, automobile
exhausts, and various industrial dusts.
Acute symptoms may be caused in any asthmatic individual on
exposure to any of the above and may be worsened by beta-blocker
therapy or use of NSAIDS

Pathology
Constant exposure to environmental triggers causes persistent mucosal
inflammation. Asthmatic attacks occur due to:
Bronchial hyper-responsiveness to cold dry air, pollen, fumes, and
paints.
Inflammatory bronchial wall oedema and intra-luminal mucus
accumulation which cause airway narrowing, airflow obstruction,
and distal air trapping.

Clinical features
Breathlessness, cough, and expiratory wheezing are the hallmarks.
‘Chest tightness’ is a common symptom. Symptoms may occur only
during exercise or exposure to cold air. Wheezes are often low-pitched
and heard only on forced expiration.
Diurnal variation is common, due to the circadian variation in
endogenous cortisol production. Symptoms are generally worse on
waking and, in severe cases, may cause nocturnal awakening with
cough, chest tightness, and dyspnoea. Symptoms generally improve
through the day and episodic exacerbations may be triggered by
various stimuli and last minutes, hours, or days.

Diagnosis of asthma
This is based on characteristic clinical features. Measurement of
variability in diurnal or stimulus-induced serial PEFR measurements is
also useful. Astma is diagnosed when spirometry or peak expiratory
flow rate (PEFR) shows >15% reduction in response to stimulus
challenge e.g. 6-10 minutes of strenuous exercise; PEFR is <60%
predicted or varies by >30%; or PEFR improves by >20% with
bronchodilators or steroids.

Management
Identify and avoid all environmental and other triggers; relief of acute

symptoms with β-agonist inhalers and suppression of chronic
inflammatory airways hyper-reactivity with inhaled or oral steroids or
leukotrine antagonists.

Aims of treatment
Freedom from symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma.
Lung functions within the normal range varying by <20% during 24 h.
Normal quality of life.

Acute severe asthma
Ascertain the recent best or predicted PEFR, the current medication,
(especially that recently taken for relief of this attack), and the date
of the last severe attack.

Features of severe asthma
Cannot speak in whole sentences.
Respiration >25 breaths/min.
Pulse >110 beats/min.
PEFR <50% of best or predicted.

Life-threatening asthma
Silent chest, cyanosis or feeble respiratory effort.
Bradycardia, dysrhythmia, or hypotension.
Exhaustion, confusion, or coma.

Rule out airways obstruction due to a foreign body, epiglotitis,
mediastinal masses.

Immediate management
1. Sit the patient up and give 40-60% O2.
2. Give Salbutamol 5 mg or terbutaline 10 mg by O2-driven nebulizer.
Alternately, give 4-6 puffs via a spacer and repeat every 10-20
minutes.

3. Give hydrocortisone 100 mg iv or prednisolone 40-60 mg po.
4. Do ABGs, CXR, PEFR, oximetry.

If there is no improvement or there are signs of
life-threatening asthma
1. Contact an anaesthetist about possible emergency intubation.
2. Add ipratropium 0.5 mg to the nebulized salbutamol.
3. Give aminophylline 5 mg per kg by iv infusion over 20 mins but avoid
or use with great caution in patients already taking oral
aminophylline.

If the patient is improving continue with
1. Oxygen 40-60% guided by O2 saturations which should be >92%.
2. Prednisolone 40-60 mg per day or hydrocortisone 100 mg iv q6 h.
3. Salbutamol 5 mg nebulized q4-6 hourly and SOS.

If the patient is not improving
1. Continue with O2 and steroids.
2. Nebulized salbutamol 5 mg up to every 15-30 mins until the
bronchospasm is relieved.
3. Ipratropium 0.5 mg q 6 hourly.
4. Consider a continuous aminophylline infusion 750-1000 mg over 24 h
(500 mcg/kg/hr); monitor blood concentrations if possible.

Monitoring response to therapy
1. PEFR 15-30 mins after treatment and at least q 6 hrly.
2. Maintain SaO2>92% with supplemental oxygen.
3. Recheck ABG to monitor potential respiratory failure.

On discharge from hospital
Patient stable on discharge medication for 24 h and have had their
inhaler technique checked and recorded.
PEFR >75% of best or predicted and PEFR diurnal variability <25% (no
nocturnal dipping).
Treatment initiated with high-dose inhaled steroids to cover
tapering oral steroid therapy.
Follow-up in one week or SOS.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
This is a chronic progressive disease of the airways and terminal
alveoli that occurs in smokers, ex-smokers, and people exposed to
smoke (e.g. people cooking food on open fire with poor ventilation). It
is characterized by cough, sputum production, wheezing, and
exertional dyspnoea.

Pathology
Inhalation of smoke elicits a neutrophil inflammatory response in the
airways which overcomes the protective effects of pulmonary protease
inhibitors and causes chronic bronchial inflammation and airway
damage. Lung defences are impaired by smoke resulting in recurrent
respiratory infections and bacterial colonization of the proximal
airways. Bronchial mucosal gland hyperplasia and hypertrophy causes
excessive mucus secretion and airway thickening and consequent
narrowing. This gives rise to a chronic productive cough, often
seasonal and worse in winters. Alveoli are particularly damaged in
emphysema. This causes a loss of lung units and overdistention of the
remaining alveoli, leading to compression of the terminal bronchioles
and further airway obstruction.

Clinical features
Patients with COPD often experience chronic productive cough,

recurrent respiratory infections, and/or exertional dyspnoea.
Pulmonary function deteriorates after respiratory infections, and this
may take weeks to recover. Minor respiratory infections may
precipitate respiratory failure and necessitate hospitalization. Patients
are often wheezy, tachypnoeic, and use accessory muscles of
respiration during exacerbations. In advanced cases, patients may be
plethoric, cyanosed, and show signs of right heart failure (cor
pulmonale). Type I or Type II respiratory failure is common —
confusion, drowsiness, and flapping tremor indicates CO2 retention.

Management
Stopping smoking and reducing exposure to indoor cooking smoke is
essential. Bronchodilators provide relief and are required regularly. A
trial of prednisolone 30-40 mg per day should be given for 2-3 weeks
and pre- and post-steroid lung functions obtained to establish whether
the individual patient has steroid response. Chest physiotherapy helps
in clearing mucus and may build respiratory muscle strength.
O2 therapy should be closely monitored as some patients require the
hypoxia to drive respiration and rapid correction of hypoxia with
unmonitored high concentrations of oxygen may cause CO2 retention
and narcosis. Home and portable O2 therapy helps many patients, and
some require non-invasive ventilation with a BiPAP machine.

Advice to smokers regarding smoking cessation*
Preparation: make a positive decision and list reasons for
quitting. Get the support of family/friends. Set a target date.
Have realistic expectations of the difficulty. Know that most
relapses occur in the first week after quitting.
Switch brands: to one that is distasteful and low in tar/nicotine
prior to the target date.
Cut down the number of cigarettes: smoke only half of each
cigarette. Postpone the first cigarette of each day by 1 h. Smoke
only during odd or even hrs of the day. Remember that cutting
down is not a substitute for quitting.

Don't smoke automatically: smoke only the cigarettes you really
want. Don't empty ashtrays. Make yourself aware of each
cigarette you smoke by using the opposite hand or putting the
cigarettes in an unusual location.
Make smoking inconvenient: buy one packet/cigarette at a time.
Stop carrying them on your person.
Make smoking unpleasant: only smoke alone, if accustomed to
smoking in company. Whilst smoking, isolate yourself from others
and focus on the negative effects of smoking. Collect all butts in a
large glass container.
Prepare for the target day: practise going without cigarettes.
Think of quitting in terms of one day at a time.
On the day of quitting: throw away all cigarettes and matches,
and hide ashtrays and lighters. Make a list of things you want to
buy, price them in terms of cigarettes and put the money aside to
buy them. Keep very busy on the target day. Remind
family/friends about the day. Buy yourself a treat or do something
special.
Immediately after quitting: develop a clean, fresh, non-smoking
environment around you. Go to places where smoking is not
allowed.
Avoid temptation: avoid situations you associate with smoking;
socialize only where smoking is not allowed.

Oxygen therapy
If the patient has a PaO2 <8 kPa on air, give a trial of oxygen at 2
l/min via a mask. Recheck ABG after 1 h.
If there is no rise in PaCO2, increase the oxygen to 4 l/min and
recheck ABGs after another hour.
If there is still no rise, the patient is not CO2 retaining and may
have oxygen therapy without risk.
If CO2 does rise, reduce oxygen delivery to the level before which
CO2 was retained.

At this point, if available, it is worth considering non-invasive
ventilation via mask (e.g. BiPAP).

Bronchiectasis
This condition is characterized by long-standing damage and dilatation
of bronchi and bronchioles leading to inflammation and accumulation
of infected mucus. Persistent infection within the bronchiectatic
airways with H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, or Ps.
aeuruginosa causes the clinical symptoms.

Aetiology
Bronchiectasis may be localized as a result of a previous infection or
generalized as occurs in congenital conditions e.g cystic fibrosis,
Kartagener's syndrome, or hypogammaglobulinaemia. Most cases are
2° to pulmonary TB, TB lymph node disease, necrotizing pneumonias,
whooping cough, foreign body inhalation, allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis (proximal bronchiectasis).

Clinical features of bronciectasis
Depending on the severity, patients may continuously produce mucoid
or purulent sputum. Patients may be asymptomatic between acute
exacerbations — when the individual coughs abundant purulent
sputum. Fever, haemoptysis, and chest pain are often features,
especially when infection spreads to the lung parenchyma producing
bronchopneumonia. Chronic sinusitis and otitis media may be
associated. Clubbing is prominent, expiratory crackles with occasional
wheezes are heard in the lungs.

Complications
Recurrent episodes of pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory failure,
massive haemoptysis, 2° amyloidosis, brain abscesses, and
arthropathy.

Diagnosis
Largely based on the history and clinical features. Bronchiectetic cysts
with fluid levels and ‘tram lining’ are seen on CXRs, but CXR
underestimates the extent of bronchiectasis. Confirmation and disease
extent is best gauged on a high-resolution CT scan. Airways obstruction
and reversibility should be gauged by PFTs. Sputum should be cultured
to choose appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Congenital syndromes
should be excluded by sinus X-rays, sweat test, ECGs, and
immunoglobulin levels.

Management
Physiotherapy is useful at all times especially during acute
exacerbations. Patients should be taught postural drainage and deep
breathing/coughing exercises.
Underlying conditions will require separate and continuous
treatment. Focal disease with severe recurrent symptoms may be
suitable for surgical resection — but CT often shows bronchiectasis is
widespread and bilateral, which rules out surgery.
Severe haemoptysis may require angiographic embolization or
surgical resection.
Airways obstruction requires bronchodilators and hydration.
Antibiotics are indicated as soon as the patient is symptomatic with
purulent sputum. Co-amoxiclav is a reasonable first choice and
should be modified once cultures are available. Therapy should
continue for 1-2 weeks.
Pseudomonas colonization requires use of fluoroquinolones or IV
ceftazidime or other aminoglycosides — depending on sensitivities.
Patients should be given a prescription for 3 or 4 oral antibiotics
(amoxicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline) and
advised to rotate through them with each fresh infection.

Prevention

Hib, pneumococcal, and influenza vaccination. Early identification and
treatment of TB and whooping cough.

Lung cancer
Carcinoma of the bronchus is a disease of smokers (>95% of cases) and
is related to the quantity and duration of exposure to cigarette smoke.
Most patients present too late for cure, and prevention by continuously
emphasizing the danger of smoking is the best option.

Clinical features
Patients may have widely differing symptoms:
Pulmonary features: persistent cough or alteration in the previous
chronic cough; haemoptysis; chest pain; dyspnoea. Distal
pneumonia, pleural effusions, localized wheezing, or stridor may be
found.
Local/mediastinal invasion: vocal cord paralysis, Horner's syndrome,
SVC obstruction, chest wall invasion, bony pains, brachial plexus
involvement, dysphagia, and pericardial effusion.
Metastatic spread: symptoms and signs depend on the organ involved
e.g. brain, liver, adrenal, skin, and bones (esp. ribs, spine, and
femoral). Lymph node involvement is common esp. mediastinal,
scalene, and supraclavicular.
Systemic symptoms: fatigue, lassitude, anorexia, marked weight
loss. Fever may occur without infection.
Endocrinopathies: SIADH is common, as is hypercalcaemia from
secretion of PTH-like substances or from bony metastases. Ectopic
ACTH production, gynaecomastia, and testicular atrophy can also
occur.
Others: clubbing is common, occasionally severe, with hypertrophic
pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Neuromuscular syndromes (e.g. Eaton
Lambert syndrome) are rare.

Diagnosis

This is based on CXR or CT imaging which shows a mass,
collapse/consolidation, or invasive disease; CT is also useful in staging
the disease. Histology is obtained from a biopsy/cytology obtained via
a bronchoscopy/BAL, FNAC, truecut CT guided biopsy or, in certain
cases, a minithoracotomy. The yield from sputum cytology is low but
non-invasive. Pleural fluid cytology is useful in patients with
disseminated lung cancer and mesotheliomas.

Management
Surgery is often impossible because of extensive cancer or co-existant
COPD caused by prolonged smoking. A small group of patients (<20%)
with localized non-small cell disease may respond well to surgery.
Palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy both prolong life and
improve complications such as haemoptysis, SVC obstruction, and
recurrent pleural effusions. Patients with small cell cancer almost
always have disseminated disease and surgery is not an option —
palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy can extend and improve
quality of life and manage complications.

Prevention
Aggressive anti-smoking campaigns benefit patients and those exposed
to passive smoke. Reduce chemicals and dust in the work environment.

Lung cancer: tumour types
Squamous cell carcinoma: tumours with a medium rate of growth
that often present with obstruction. Metastatic spread is common
(80% of tumours at presentation).
Small-cell (oat-cell) carcinoma: fast-growing tumours that often
present with disseminated disease. They may secrete hormones.
Adenocarcinoma: (includes bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma) the
most common peripheral tumour, it may produce mucin and will
surround associated bronchi, stenosing the lumen. May not be
smoking-related.
Large-cell carcinoma: large, necrotic, pleomorphic, mucinproducing tumours.They are frequently peripheral and locally

invasive; while metastatic spread is common, survival rates postsurgery are good.
Carcinoid tumours: a group of tumours that are unrelated to
smoking and occur in a younger age group. They may be
malignant and metastasize to distal organs. Most occur in
proximal airways.
Metastases: often from primaries in the breast, colon, kidney,
prostate, and lung. Less often choriocarcinoma, testicular cancer,
sarcomas, melanoma.
Mesotheliomas: malignancies of the pleural space caused by
exposure, often remote, to asbestos. Spread is local but rarely
may metastatise.

Pulmonary embolism (PE)
Most pulmonary emboli occur as a result of migration of soft thrombi
of recent onset from the deep veins of the leg or the pelvis. Embolism
from mural intracardiac thrombi and right-sided endocarditis may also
occur. Septic thrombophlebitis due to infected central lines is
increasingly common and severe thrombotic disease due to congenital
or acquired thrombogenic states (protein C, protein S, or antithrombin
III deficiency, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, etc.) may cause
recurrent deep vein or other thrombosis and embolism or in situ
pulmonary thrombosis.

Clinical features
Most patients will have minor and subacute symptoms with
tachypnoea, mild dyspnoea, a cough, and occasionally low-grade fever.
Pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis indicate pulmonary infarction and
represent larger degrees of embolism. In cases of massive pulmonary
embolism, the patient has circulatory collapse and may die acutely. In
patients with showers of low-grade emboli over many years,
pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale may ensue.
Respiratory findings are sparse, and hypoxia with a normal CXR
suggests the possibility of a PE (the other main cause of hypoxia with a

normal CXR is PCP). A DVT may be present. Investigations: CXR, ECG,
V/Q scan, CT pulmonary angiogram, Doppler ultrasound of the legs,
and D-dimer levels. These tests are useful in both the confirmation and
exclusion of DVTs and PEs.

Management
Initially, patients are anticoagulated with intravenous conventional
heparins or with low molecular weight heparin. When PE is confirmed,
oral anticoagulation with warfarin is commenced and a target INR of
2.5-3.0 is necessary for 48-72 h before heparin can be safely
discontinued. In acute massive PE, thrombolysis with streptokinase is
useful.

Pneumothorax

P.210

This condition is caused by the entry of air into the pleural space
leading to collapse and sometimes compression of the underlying lung.
When a rapid ongoing accumulation of air occurs with each bout of
coughing (tension pneumothorax), there is severe cardiorespiratory
compromise and relief of the tension pneumothorax is an emergency. A
small or moderate pneumothorax may be sufficient to cause
respiratory failure in a patient with pre-existing lung disease.
Pneumothorax may be asymptomatic in an otherwise healthy patient.

Causes
Spontaneous pneumothorax: Common in tall and thin men with no
pre-existing lung disease. The chance of recurrence is 20% after the
1st episode and increases to 65% after the 2nd episode.
Secondary pneumothorax: Occurs in patients with scars of previous
TB or in patients with active TB, often cavitary. Also in patients with
COPD, severe necrotizing lung infections such as staphylococcal
pneumonia, aspiration pneumonias, and, in some cases of PCP.
Traumatic pneumothorax: Occurs from penetrating external injuries
e.g. stabbing or road traffic accident.
Iatrogenic pneumothorax: May be a complication of central line

insertion, transbronchial lung biopsy, or due to barotrauma caused
by high-pressure mechanical ventilation.

Clinical features
Most patients will complain of sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and
dyspnoea. Hyper-resonance to percussion is accompanied by ↓
movement and ↓ or absent breath sounds on the affected side.
Breathing is generally shallow on account of splinting due to pain. A
patient with tension pneumothorax has features of mediastinal
displacement away from the pneumothorax, with severe tachypnoea,
dyspnoea (often with hypoxia), and cardiovascular instability.

Management
Small pneumothoraces (CXR shows pneumothorax occupies <15% of
hemithorax) in asymptomatic, otherwise healthy, individuals need
no treatment other than observation. Follow-up X-rays should
demonstrate gradual absorption of the pneumothorax. Small
pneumothoraces in symptomatic patients or in patients with preexisting lung disease require needle aspiration — possibly followed
by a tube drain. Needle aspiration is suitable for iatrogenic
pneumothoraces because these are unlikely to recur.
Large pneumothoraces should be aspirated through the second
intercostal space with a cannula and a syringe fitted to an
underwater drain. If >2 litres of air is freely withdrawn it is likely
that a bronchopleural fistula exists and an intercostal chest drain
should be placed. Use the 5/6th intercostals space in the mid-axillary
line.
Pleurodesis may be required in patients whose pneumothorax fails to
resolve despite 1-2 weeks of intercostal drainage and suction.
A tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and requires the
immediate placement of a wide bore needle into the 2nd intercostal
space on the affected side. Air usually bubbles out in a rush and the
relief is immediate. Intercostal tube drainage should follow.

Pleurodesis
This procedure aims to cause sterile chemical inflammation of the
pleura and obliteration of the pleural space as a result of
subsequent adhesions and fibrosis. It is painful and adequate
analgesia is a must. 20 ml of 1% lignocaine is diluted with saline to
form a volume of 100 ml and this is inserted into the chest tube
which is then clamped. The patient is placed on his back, side, and
chest in order to disperse the anaesthesia and after this is drained
off, 0.5 g of tetracycline dissolved in 30-50 mL normal saline or 20
ml of povidone-iodine 10% added to 80 mL normal saline is inserted
into the chest drain and the procedure repeated. The solution is
kept in the chest for 3-4 h and then drained off. The chest drain is
maintained in situ till air ceases to bubble through it.

Diarrhoeal diseases
Mary E. Penny
Section editor

Introduction
Diarrhoea is the passage of abnormally loose or fluid stools more
frequently than normal. Normal bowel habit varies, but recent onset
>3 liquid/loose stools per day is considered abnormal.
Infective diarrhoea is the 3rd highest cause of death due to infection in
the world, with ~1-2 million deaths each year; 80% deaths are in
children under <2 yrs, most of these during and shortly after the
introduction of complementary foods between 6-12 months.
Micronutrient deficiencies, especially zinc deficiency, increase the
incidence of infective diarrhoea. Breastfeeding, especially exclusive
breastfeeding, confers significant protection. Repeated attacks of
diarrhoea initiate a vicious cycle of malnutrition, reduced immunity,
and more intestinal infections. Diarrhoea is a common symptom of
HIV/AIDS.
An accurate history will give clues to the aetiology and severity of
diarrhoea. Ask about previous episodes and current medication.
The treatment of most diarrhoeal episodes depends on treating and
preventing dehydration regardless of the aetiology. Antimicrobials are
only recommended for dysentery and cholera, and for severe episodes
with laboratory diagnosis in certain vulnerable groups (see below).
Anti-diarrhoeal agents should be avoided in young children.

Some key questions to be asked
How long has the diarrhoea been present?
Is there (or was there) fever or other systemic symptoms?
What is the stool like — specifically is there blood (bright red or
dark) and/or mucus?
How frequent and abundant are the motions?
Is there any abdominal pain — if so, where?
Is there tenesmus (a sense of incomplete emptying following
defecation)?
Has the patient vomited — if so, how much, when, what?
Has the patient lost weight?
Have any household or close contacts had diarrhoea?
What did they eat and drink in the 24 h before getting diarrhoea —
anything unusual?
If the diarrhoea is recurrent/remittent, is it related to any
particular food or drink?
Is anyone else in the family ill?
Is there a history of recent travel? If so, where?
Has the patient been exposed to malaria?
Is the patient at risk of HIV infection?
In examining the patient, one should look for signs of dehydration and
malnutrition, as well as for clues to determine the disease aetiology.

Classification of diarrhoea
Subdivide diarrhoeal diseases according to presence or not of blood
in the stool, since the causes are generally different, but be aware
that both shigellosis and Campylobacter infections may present as
acute watery diarrhoea. Here we shall divide the diseases into
acute diarrhoea with blood (dysentery) and acute diarrhoea without

blood. Persistent diarrhoea lasts >14 days and additional diseases
need to be considered — this condition is accorded a separate
section.

Antimicrobial drugs
In the majority of cases, symptoms of diarrhoea improve with
treatment of dehydration alone, without the need for antibiotics.
Antimicrobial drugs may be beneficial in:
Bloody diarrhoea (dysentery) that does not improve after 3 days
of rehydration therapy: If a specific cause is found, it should be
treated appropriately (see relevant section below). If no cause
can be found, an antimicrobial effective against Shigella (e.g.
ciprofloxacin) should be given.
Cholera with severe dehydration: Any suspected case of cholera
should be treated with an effective antimicrobial (e.g.
azithromycin) and control agencies notified.
Laboratory-proven symptomatic cases of G. intestinalis infection:
that do not improve after 3 days of ORS therapy should be treated
with an antimicrobial (e.g. tinidazole).
Laboratory-proven enteropathogenic E. coli infections: respond to
antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) and should be used in vulnerable
hosts such as young babies.
Traveller's diarrhoea: duration is reduced when treated with an
antibiotic (e.g. ciprofloxacin).

Investigations
Most uncomplicated cases of diarrhoea can be managed without any
laboratory tests. In a hospital setting or if diarrhoea continues
beyond 2-3 days, do Hb, FBC, U&E, and glucose. Stool culture and
microscopy are often requested but few centres can offer diagnostic
tests for all enteropathogens; mixed infections are common; singlestool cultures are insufficient for some pathogens (e.g. Giardia,
amoebae, Shigella); and results will often come back too late to
influence management. Apart from investigation of outbreaks,

surveillance, and research purposes, stool culture in uncomplicated
cases should be limited to the exclusion of those pathogens for
which antibiotic treatment is indicated (e.g. parasites, Shigella
species, and Vibrio cholerae). If appropriate, do a blood film for
malaria.

How to make a direct faecal smear
1. Write the patient's name on a clean slide. Place a drop of sterile
saline in the centre of the left-hand side of the slide and place a
drop of iodine in the centre of the right-hand side of the slide.
2. With a match or applicator, pick up a small portion of faeces (~2 mg
— or about the size of a match head) and add it to the drop of
saline. Repeat and add to the iodine. Mix the faeces with the drops
to form suspensions.
3. Cover each drop with a coverslip.
4. Examine each drop with the ×10 objective or, for identification, with
the higher-power objectives, searching in a systematic manner.
When organisms are seen, switch to higher power for more detail.

depending on stool characteristics.

Acute diarrhoea with blood
The presence of blood in diarrhoea is called dysentery and usually
signifies ulceration of the large bowel. The most common bacterial
agents causing dysentery are Shigella (bacillary dysentery) and
Campylobacter. Shigellosis can be a serious infection that progresses to
complications and death. Dysentery should be treated on clinical
diagnosis with antibiotics that cover Shigella. If no improvement after
48 h, antibiotics should be changed taking into account stool culture
findings. If culture results are negative or unavailable, still change the
antibiotic (e.g. from co-trimoxazole to nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin,
or from ciprofloxacin to azithromycin) on the basis of a lack of clinical

response to initial therapy.

Bacillary dysentery (shigellosis)
Shigella dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonneii cause the
disease known as bacillary dysentery, with the former two species
responsible for most morbidity and mortality (which may reach 20% in
untreated cases). The disease may occur both endemically and
epidemically, with children most frequently affected. The incubation
period in humans (the only natural host) is 1-5 days following direct
person to person contact (often with asymptomatic excreters) or
ingestion of contaminated water and food.

Clinical features:
range from mild disease in which there is intermittent watery
diarrhoea alone, to severe systemic complications. In severe cases,
onset is usually rapid, with tenesmus, fever, and passage of frequent
(up to 100/day ~every 15 minutes) bloody mucoid stools. Intestinal
complications include: toxic megacolon, perforation, and proteinlosing enteropathy. Systemic complications include: dehydration,
hypoglycaemia, and electrolyte imbalance (particularly
hyponatraemia), haemolyticuraemic syndrome, convulsions
(particularly in children, often before the onset of diarrhoea), Reiter's
syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, pneumonia. Invasive
disease may give ‘rose spots’ — crops of 2-4 mm papules which fade on
pressure, usually appearing on the upper abdomen and lower chest.

Diagnosis:
the clinical distinction between bacillary and amoebic dysentery is
usually impossible. Stool microscopy often shows leukocytes (pus cells)
in shigellosis vs. haematophagus trophozoites in amoebic dysentery.

Management
Oral rehydration is sufficient for mild disease. In severe disease,
ampicillin or trimethoprim (or co-trimoxazole) should be given,
although resistance is common; quinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are an

alternative. Antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to the local
sensitivity pattern if individual sensitivity of isolates is not possible.

Prevention:
food and hand hygiene; no vaccine is currently available.

Reiter's syndrome
Classic Reiter's syndrome is a triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis and a
seronegative, large joint, mono- or oligoarthritis, but it can also follow
dysentery. Associated features: iritis, enthesopathy, keratoderma
blenorrhagica, and circinate balanitis.

Infective causes of acute diarrhoea with blood
(dysentery)
Bacillary dysentery (shigellosis).
Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli.
Campylobacter enterocolitis.
Salmonella enterocolitis.
Clostridium difficile associated (pseudomembranous) colitis.
Yersinia enterocolitis.
Amoebic dysentery.
Balantidium coli enterocolitis.
Massive Trichuris infection.
S. mansoni or S. japonicum.
All may also cause diarrhoea without blood. Non-infectious causes
include IBD, colorectal cancer or polyps, ischaemic colitis.

Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and haemolytic
uraemic syndrome (HUS)
These bacteria produce vero cell cytotoxins similar to the toxin
produced by Shigella dysenteriae. The most common EHEC is E. coli
0157. These bacteria have been associated with a number of

outbreaks of inflammatory, haemorrhagic colitis, and haemolytic
uraemic syndrome (HUS). Infections occur most frequently in the
summer months. Contaminated food is the most common cause,
particularly ground beef in hamburgers, or milk. Fruit, vegetables,
and cider may be contaminated by animal faeces. Crosscontamination of meat products has been responsible for outbreaks.

Clinical features:
the illness usually starts with watery diarrhoea, blood appearing
after 2-3 days. Vomiting and abdominal tenderness are common (can
mimic appendicitis, intussusception, or IBD). HUS is a lifethreatening complication in 8-10% of children with E. coli 0157
infection, usually about a week after onset of diarrhoea. (Other
causes include shigellosis and drugs.) HUS is characterized by a
microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, renal
failure, and CNS involvement. Clinical features overlap with those
of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP) in which CNS
involvement is much more common.

Diagnosis:
stool culture diagnostic but not generally available. The presence of
an outbreak and exposure risk often found in the history.

Management
1. Oral rehydration and supportive care.
2. Antibiotics are not indicated: they have been associated with
increased duration and may increase the risk of HUS.
3. Antimotility drugs should be avoided.

Prevention:
improve animal husbandry and slaughterhouse management to
prevent contamination of meat with intestinal content; pasteurize
dairy products; cook beef adequately; wash hands frequently with
soap including after contact with farm animals or meat.

Campylobacter enterocolitis
C. jejuni (also C. coli and C. lari) cause epidemics in nurseries or

paediatric wards and are common in the community in developing
countries. Bacteria may be excreted in the faeces up to 3 weeks after
the cessation of diarrhoea. Campylobacter sp. infect most mammals
and birds and transmission may be by contact with animal or poultry
excreta or contaminated food or water.

Clinical features:
Episodes typically start with fever, abdominal pain, and watery
diarrhoea. This may be followed by bloody diarrhoea, indistinguishable
from Shigella and Salmonella infections. Abdominal pain may be
prominent even after diarrhoea settles. The disease normally settles in
5-7 days. Severe, disseminated infection can occur in presence of
malnutrition, liver disease, malignancy, diabetes, renal failure, and
immunosuppression. Complications include bacteraemia, meningitis,
deep abscesses, cholecystitis, reactive arthritis/Reiter's syndrome, and
Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Diagnosis:
Gram stain or dark-field microscopy of faecal smears shows curved
gram-negative rods with ‘gull wing’ and ‘S-shapes’; confirmed on
culture. In severe disease, colonoscopy/biopsy may be needed.

Prevention:
Campylobacter infection is an almost ubiquitous zoonosis. Prevention
depends on breaking the chain of food and water contamination. No
vaccine is currently available.

Yersinia enterocolitis
Yersinia enterocolitica is a rare cause of diarrhoea in the tropics.
There may be low-grade fever, bloody diarrhoea, and abdominal pain
affecting mainly children <5 yrs, plus nausea, vomiting, headache, or
pharyngitis. Infection may spread to cause septicaemia; peritonitis;
hepatic, renal, and splenic abscesses; pyomyositis; and osteomyelitis.
These complications are more common in immunocompromised
patients or those who are iron overloaded (e.g. haemochromatosis).

Diagnosis:
culture from stool or other sites of infection.

Management of Campylobacter and Yersinia
enterocolitis
Rehydration and supportive care are usually sufficient for
Campylobacter and Yersinia infections. Severe disease may require
antibiotics:
Campylobacter: Use erythromycin; resistant strains (esp. C. coli)
may need trimethoprim (or co-trimoxazole), ciprofloxacin, or
azithromycin.
Yersinia: In complicated disease, use one of the following:
gentamicin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, or doxycycline.

Salmonella enterocolitis
Salmonella typhimurium and S. enteritidis enterocolitis are an
important public health problem in the developing world. Transmission
is usually by ingestion of contaminated food (they survive freezing at
-20°C). The organisms are common among wild and domestic animals.
Reptiles kept as pets may also be a source of Salmonella infection. The
incubation period is 24-48 h (up to 72 h); bacteria are then excreted in
the faeces for up to 8 weeks following infection. More common in HIV
infection.

Clinical features:
range in severity according to the serotype involved. Two (often
overlapping) clinical syndromes are seen:
Acute enterocolitis: nausea and vomiting, headache, fever, and
malaise, rapidly progressing to diarrhoea with cramping abdominal
pains. Initially voluminous and watery, the stool changes to be
bloody with mucus as the disease progresses. There may be LIF pain

and rebound tenderness. Infrequently, ileal involvement is dominant
with symptoms mimicking appendicitis. Toxic megacolon may
complicate severe colitis.
Invasive salmonellosis: bacteraemia rates of 8% have been recorded,
with higher rates for certain serotypes. Predisposing factors are:
extremes of age, immunosuppression, malignancy, gastric
hypoacidity (e.g. antacid use), severe comorbidity, bartonellosis,
HIV, malarial anaemia and sickle cell disease. Invasive salmonellosis
is characterized by swinging fevers, rigors, and toxaemia
accompanying the diarrhoea, or a typhoid-like illness characterized
by sustained fever, splenomegaly, rose spots, and minimal diarrhoea.
There may be metastatic spread to meninges (children <2 yrs old),
bones and joints, lungs, heart valves and arteries, liver, spleen,
ovaries, or kidneys. A reactive arthritis can occur. Patients with
chronic schistosomiasis are prone to 2° Salmonella bacteraemia
since the bacteria live within the worm and are protected from
antibiotics.

Diagnosis:
requires isolation of the bacteria from faecal or blood cultures.
Sigmoidoscopy may be necessary in severely ill patients. Salmonella
typhi and S paratyphi (
p 684) do not usually present with diarrhoea
and should not be confused with enterocolitis due to non-typhi
Salmonellae.

Management
Rehydration and supportive care are usually sufficient.
Most antibiotics do not shorten the diarrhoea and may prolong
bacterial carriage.
Treat patients with severe colitis and/or invasive disease, or in
whom the risk of developing severe disease is high (e.g. neonates,
immunosuppressed, and elderly), with ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bd for
5 days.
Chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, trimethoprim, or co-trimoxazole may

be effective in systemic disease, but resistance is increasing.
Cefotaxime/ceftriaxone still highly effective, where available.

Amoebic dysentery
Around 48 million people worldwide are infected by the protozoon
Entamoeba histolytica and, although only about 10% are symptomatic,
it is an important parasitic cause of death with an annual mortality of
~70,000. Severe infection occurs in pregnant women, very young
children, the malnourished, and people on steroids. It is now
recognized that most of those previously thought to have
asymptomatic E. histolytica infection are actually infected with the
related amoeba E. dispar, which is morphologically indistinguishable
but non-pathogenic to humans.

Transmission:
is usually through food and drink contaminated with human faeces;
prevalence is highest where human faeces are used as fertilizer. Sexual
transmission also occurs. Cysts are ingested and pass into the small and
large intestine, dividing to form metacysts and trophozoites. As
trophozoites pass through the colon they desiccate to form ‘precysts’
and then cysts. Mature cysts are evacuated in the stool and remain
viable and infective for up to 2 months in cool, damp conditions. E.
histolytica has the capacity to destroy almost any tissue in the body,
with amoebic liver abscess being the most common extra-intestinal
manifestation.

Clinical features:
are related to the degree and location of tissue damage by
trophozoites and range from an asymptomatic carrier state to
fulminant colitis and invasive extra-intestinal disease (see box).
Intestinal amoebiasis usually has an insidious onset with abdominal
discomfort and diarrhoea becoming increasingly bloody and mucoid as
severity increases. Rectosigmoid involvement is frequently associated
with tenesmus. On palpation, there may be tenderness over the
caecum, transverse, and sigmoid colon; if involved, the liver may be

enlarged and tender. Colonoscopy may reveal hyperaemic, necrotic
ulcers covered with a yellowish exudate, particularly in the region of
the flexures. Complications include toxic megacolon and bowel
perforation. Following repeated infection, an amoebic granuloma
(amoeboma) may develop (most frequently at the caecum) where it
may be palpable and mistaken for a malignant mass.

Diagnosis:
is often difficult and relies on identification of E. histolytica cysts or
trophozoites in the stool. Demonstration of cysts does not prove
amoebiasis is cause of symptoms as E. histolytica cysts are
macroscopically identical to common, non-pathogenic E. dispar cysts.
Examine at least 3 stool samples for cysts using concentration and
permanent stain techniques, preferably before administration of
medications or contrast media since these interfere with amoebae
recovery.
A ‘hot stool’ (examined within 30 minutes) is required to look for
trophozoites. Examine a wet mount preparation for motile
amoebae. The presence of E. histolytica trophozoites containing
ingested erythrocytes is diagnostic of amoebiasis.
Techlab Entamoeba 11® is a faecal ELISA that will differentiate
invasive E. histolytica cysts or trophozoites from those of E. dispar.
E. histolytica serology useful in non-endemic areas.

Management
Metronidazole 800 mg PO tds for 5 days, followed by.
Diloxanide furoate 500 mg PO tds for 10 days.
If there are signs of peritonism, add a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
Metronidazole is effective against the trophozoites but because it
has little effect on the cysts, treatment should be followed by a
luminal amoebicide such as diloxanide or paromomycin.

Prevention:
Ensure safe disposal of human faeces; prevent faecal contamination of
water supplies. Filtering water with sand or diatomaceous earth is
effective. Personal hygiene including handwashing.

Extra-intestinal amoebiasis
Following colonic invasion, trophozoites may travel in the portal
circulation to the liver; further direct or haematogenous spread
may occur to almost any tissue of the body. The most common form
of extra-intestinal disease is amoebic liver abscess (ALA,
p 286).
~10% ALA patients have diarrhoea; ~20% have a history of previous
dysentery. Digestion of hepatocytes by trophozoites leads to foci of
liver necrosis which coalesce to form abscesses containing reddishbrown ‘anchovy sauce’ fluid. This fluid is digested liver, not pus
(WBC not seen on microscopy) and has no odour; it seldom contains
visible amoebae. Rupture into the pericardium (esp. of left lobe
abscesses) causes pericardial amoebiasis, often → cardiac
tamponade and death; adequate pericardial drainage usually
requires thoracotomy. ALA rupture through the diaphragm to form a
bronchohepatic fistula and cause pleuro-pulmonary amoebiasis, with
cough, dyspnoea, and expectoration of ‘anchovy sauce’ material.
Peritoneal amoebiasis occurs due to colonic or ALA rupture,
cutaneous amoebiasis due to percutaneous rupture, and cerebral
amoebiasis due to haematogenous spread. All may occur without
diarrhoea.

Diagnosis:
is usually clinical ± demonstration of trophozoites (which may be
scarce) in the affected tissue and/or in the stool. Amboebic serology
is sensitive.

Management:
Medical management as for amoebic dysentery. Liver abscess often
aspirated to differentiate from bacterial liver abscess (fluid is pus,
often foul-smelling; in bacterial liver abscess, drainage or aspiration
is important for cure). In ALA, drainage or aspiration of abscess is
indicated if poor response to medical therapy or high risk of rupture

(especially for abscess in left lobe of liver).

Balantidium enterocolitis
Balantidium coli is a rare protozoal pathogen of humans. It exists in
cyst and trophozoite forms; cysts are responsible for faeco-oral
transmission. Trophozoites invade intestinal mucosa producing
inflammation and ulceration. Clinical features resemble amoebic
colitis and include:
Asymptomatic carrier state (80%).
Acute dysentery that may be associated with nausea, abdominal
pain, and weight loss. This is potentially fatal.
Chronic diarrhoea, frequently without blood.

Diagnosis:
rests upon identification of the trophozoite in the faeces.

Management:
Symptomatic plus rehydration. Tetracycline 500 mg PO qds for 10 days
in severe disease. (Alternatives: ampicillin, metronidazole.)

Trichuriasis (whipworm)
Thought to infect ~25% of the world's population, Trichuris trichiura are
3-4 cm long and colonize the colon and rectum after ingestion of
faecally contaminated soil.

Life cycle:
ingested eggs hatch in the small intestine releasing larvae which
mature in the villi for ~1 week before colonizing the caecum and
colorectum. Released eggs pass out in the stool and can resist low
temperatures, but not desiccation. The time from ingestion to
appearance of eggs in the faeces is 60-70 days. Heavy infection is most
common in children.

Clinical features:
are often absent in mild infections. However, co-infection with Ascaris
lumbricoides or hookworms is common and may result in abdominal
distension, flatulence, RIF pain, vomiting, and weight loss. Heavy
worm burden can result in lower GI haemorrhage, mucopurulent stool,
dysentery ± rectal prolapse (worms usually seen attached to prolapsed
mucosa), and growth retardation. Massive worm burdens may cause a
protein-losing enteropathy, severe anaemia, and finger clubbing. 2°
infection with E. histolytica or B. coli can aggravate mucosal
ulceration and exacerbate dysentery.

Diagnosis:
is by detection of eggs in the stool (>30,000/g stool = heavy infection =
several hundred adult worms). There may be anaemia,
hypoalbuminaemia, and eosinophilia. Proctoscopy may reveal worms
attached to a reddened, ulcerated rectal mucosa. AXR can show
changes similar to those seen in Crohn's disease.

Management:
mebendazole 500 mg or albendazole 400 mg, both PO once, are equally
effective, although there may be regional differences in albendazole
sensitivity. 3-day courses may be used for heavy infections.

Prevention:
control is as for other soil-transmitted helminths.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea
(CDAD) & colitis
This condition (also known as antibiotic-associated colitis and
pseudomembranous colitis) is caused by infection with C. difficile
following disruption of the normal bowel flora by antibiotic therapy. It
is an important cause of hospital acquired diarrhoea.

Clinical features:
are due to the production of toxins and vary from the asymptomatic to
severe colitis with toxic megacolon. Disease severity probably depends
on a combination of patient co-morbidity and the degree of exposure
to both antibiotics and C. difficile spores. In elderly hospitalized
patients or those with significant co-morbidty, it carries a high
mortality. Sigmoidoscopy shows characteristic yellow mucosal plaques
(pseudomembranes).

Management:
metronidazole 800 mg PO stat, then 400 mg PO tds for 10 days. Oral
vancomycin (125 mg qds for 7-10 days) is an expensive alternative.

Prevention:
Avoid indiscriminate or unnecessarily prolonged use of antibiotics.
Hand washing, barrier nursing, and environmental cleaning to
eradicate spores are fundamental to preventing transmission in
hospitals.

Fig. 6.3 Life cycle of Trichuris trichiura: The adult worms are ~5
cm long (the male, shown on the left, is more tightly curled) and
live mainly in the large bowel. The eggs are shed in large numbers
and become embryonated (infectious form) after ~2 weeks to ~6
months in the environment. They are then ingested e.g. on food or
on fingertips, to become new adult worms. (Adapted from G.
Piekarski, Medical parasitology in plates, 1962 and reproduced with

Acute diarrhoea without blood

Rotavirus
In developed countries, viral infections (mainly rotavirus) account for
up to 60% of all gastroenteritis in children <5 yrs and occur in seasonal
outbreaks. In contrast, rotavirus causes <5% of all episodes of
diarrhoea in developing countries, but 40-50% of episodes require
hospitalization. It is responsible for >600,000 childhood deaths each
year. Nearly all children in the tropics have been infected by the age
of 2 years.

Clinical features:
Vomiting occurs early; fever is common; the diarrhoea is usually
watery and large volume. Colicky abdominal pains, ill-defined
tenderness, and exaggerated bowel sounds are common.

Management:
Supportive, aiming to prevent dehydration. The WHO diarrhoea
management scheme (see later) should be followed, including
treatment with zinc salts.

Dietary management:
Since rotavirus infection is common in infants, dietary management is
important to avoid malnutrition. Continue breastfeeding. Lactose
malabsorption is common but intolerance is usually only a clinical
problem in severe cases. Children with mild diarrhoea should be
encouraged to continue eating a normal diet in order to limit weight
loss. If diarrhoea continues or is severe, lactose can be reduced by
mixing milk with cereals or changing to a lactose-free diet, but calorie
intake should be maintained. As with all diarrhoeal episodes, once the
child improves or is hungry, extra food should be given to make up for
weight loss. Beware confusion with surgical causes of diarrhoea in the
neonate such as Hirschsprung's disease, intussusception, and
necrotizing enterocolitis.

Prevention:

Rotavirus infection is highly contagious, difficult to prevent, and
causes outbreaks in hospitals. Two rotavirus vaccines are available
which prevent severe illness and hospitalizations (chapter 22).

Other viral causes of diarrhoea
Astroviruses: are single-stranded RNA viruses that occur worldwide
and cause diarrhoea, mainly in children and the elderly. The
diarrhoea is similar to rotavirus, although generally milder.
Diagnosis: PCR; ELISA may be useful for diagnosis of outbreaks.
Enteric adenovirus: serotypes 40 and 41 cause diarrhoea, possibly
more in developed countries. Clinical features similar to other viral
diarrhoeas. Diagnosis: electron microscopy or ELISA.
Noroviruses (small, round structured viruses e.g. Norwalk virus): are
human enteric caliciviruses and the most important viral cause of
water and food-borne diarrhoeal outbreaks in both developing and
developed countries. Shell fish have been implicated in some
outbreaks. They are the most common viral cause of epidemic
diarrhoea and vomiting in adults (‘winter vomiting disease’).
Transmission: faeco-oral ± airborne; nosocomial transmission is
common. Clinical features: vomiting common at onset and may be
severe; watery diarrhoea rarely severe and usually lasts 12-24 h.
Diagnosis: radioimmunoassay or PCR may be used in an epidemic.

Management of viral diarrhoea:
Rehydration. Follow WHO diarrhoea treatment guidelines for
management of diarrhoea in children (see later).

Food toxins

Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
ETEC accounts for 20% of diarrhoeal cases, second only to rotavirus as
a cause of inpatient gastroenteritis in developing countries.
Transmission is by the faeco-oral route mainly via contaminated food,
less commonly water. It accounts for ~80% of travellers' diarrhoea.

Clinical features:
toxins stimulate Cl-, Na+, and water efflux into the intestinal lumen,
resulting in voluminous, watery diarrhoea after an incubation period of
1-2 days. Vomiting and abdominal cramps are frequently a feature and
up to 10 motions per day may be passed.

Diagnosis:
depends on identification of the LT or ST toxins from E. coli cultured
from faeces, but these tests are usually only available in specialized
laboratories. Simple culture of E. coli in stools is not helpful.

Management:
Supportive. Children should be managed according to WHO guidelines.
See box for travellers' diarrhoea.

Prevention:
General methods to prevent food contamination. Specific ETEC
vaccines are under development but are not yet widely available.

Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)
EPEC are strains of E. coli that include the classic pathogens O111 and
O55 and other serotypes which adhere to Hep-2 cells in culture and
human intestinal mucosal cells. In severe infections, the mucosal brush
border is lost by a process of vesiculation resulting in malabsorption
and osmotic diarrhoea. EPEC are a major cause of infantile diarrhoea
that can be devastating. Transmission is by the faeco-oral route.
Epidemics of hospital-acquired infection occur and recent
hospitalization is a risk factor for infection. It is also a cause of
traveller's diarrhoea.

Clinical features:
range from acute watery diarrhoea to severe, prolonged, or relapsing
diarrhoea, usually with mucus but no blood. Initially, there may be
vomiting and fever. Epidemics can occur affecting mainly infants, with
an untreated fatality reaching 50%.

Diagnosis:
depends on either serotyping of E.coli in stools, adherence pattern to
Hep 2 cells in culture, or DNA probes for the virulence plasmid.

Serotyping is not very reliable or specific, and cell culture techniques
and DNA probes are usually only available in specialist centres.

Management:
rehydration. Give antibiotics to vulnerable individuals such as infants
(e.g. co-trimoxazole 15 mg/kg qds for 5 days for infants >1 month old),
depending on local resistance patterns.

Prevention:
avoid routinely placing newborns in nurseries (encourage mothers and
babies to stay together and avoid shared equipment). Enforce strict
handwashing in neonatal nurseries and special care units.

Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC)
EIEC are endemic in developing countries and cause 1-5% of episodes of
diarrhoea presenting to health services. Like Shigella, EIC can invade
and multiply in epithelial cells. Clinically resembles shigellosis but
dysentery is less common. Specific diagnosis is only available in
reference laboratories. Management is supportive; treat as for
Shigella.

Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and diffuseadherent E. coli (DAEC)
These bacteria have a characteristic adherence pattern to Hep-2 cells.
They are an important cause of diarrhoea — EAEC mainly in infants and
travellers' diarrhoea and DAEC in preschool children. Clinical features
vary from asymptomatic infection to watery diarrhoea, often
persistent. Definitive diagnosis by Hep-2 cell assay is only available in
specialist centres. Management is supportive. Antibiotics may be
indicated for severe episodes; ciprofloxacin is most effective.

Cholera
Vibrio cholerae is the main cause of dehydrating diarrhoea in adults.

Clinical episodes range from asymptomatic infection to acute
fulminant watery diarrhoea which, if untreated, may be fatal.

Microbiology:
Vibrios are Gram-negative, aerobic, comma-shaped bacteria. Several
serovars of V. cholerae are recognized. Serovar 01 is responsible for
the vast majority of cholera epidemics (see box). It is killed by heating
at 55°C for 15 mins and by most disinfectants, yet it can survive in
seawater for up to 2 weeks. In most cases, the bacteria survive for
only limited periods on foodstuffs, with the notable exception of
chitinous shellfish upon which they may survive for 14 days if
refrigerated.

Transmission:
Natural reservoirs of V. cholerae have been reported in brackish water,
estuaries, and sea water in association with copepods and other
zooplankton but the most important reservoir is thought to be humans.
Infection usually requires a large infective dose and occurs via
contaminated food or water. The incubation period ranges from a few
hours to 5 days. Only a minority of infected people develop symptoms;
studies suggest that there are ~40 asymptomatic carriers of the El Tor
biotype for every symptomatic case (~5:1 for classical biotype). This is
true both in endemic areas and during outbreaks, hence the need for
meticulous hygiene.

Clinical features:
If symptomatic, varies from mild, self-limiting diarrhoea to severe,
watery ‘rice water’ diarrhoea of up to 30 litres per day. Diarrhoea
leads to electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, prostration, and
can cause death from dehydration within hours. Vomiting starts shortly
after the onset of diarrhoea in 80% of cases. Shock typically follows ~12
h later, with impaired consciousness due to hypovolaemia and
hypoglycaemia. This is particularly serious in children who, unlike
adults, may have a mild fever. Renal failure, ileus, and cardiac
arrhythmias may precede death; the elderly or those with low gastric

acid, such as alcoholics, are especially vulnerable. Muscular and
abdominal cramps are common due to loss of Ca2+ and Cl- ions.

Diagnosis:
In epidemics, the diagnosis may be made on clinical grounds alone. In
non-epidemic situations, acute watery diarrhoea resulting in severe
dehydration or the death of a patient over 5 yrs suggests cholera.
Dark-field microscopy of faecal material shows comma-shaped bacteria
darting about; this is quickly halted upon addition of diluted 01
antisera. Transportation of samples should be in alkaline peptone
water; samples should be kept cool. Culture requires selective media
such as TCBS agar. If possible, specimens should be sent to a reference
laboratory for bio- and serotyping.

Management:
Treatment consists mainly of meticulous rehydration, usually with oral
fluids. This will reduce mortality to <1% (see below for rehydration
regimens). The most common error is underestimation of the volume
of ORS or IV fluid required. In emergencies where ORS is not available,
sucrose and rice-water-based solutions can be given with success.
Antibiotics should be given to severe cases, where they have been
shown to reduce both the volume and duration of diarrhoea.
Adults: Azithromycin 1 g PO given as a single dose is drug of choice.
Doxycycline 300 mg PO is an alternative (except pregnant women). If
resistance reported, alternative antibiotic regimes are furazolidine
100 mg PO qds, or erythromycin 250 mg PO qds, or co-trimoxazole
960 mg PO bd, all for 3 days; or ciprofloxacin 1 g as a single oral
dose.
Children: give azithromycin 20 mg/kg (max 1 g) PO stat; or
erythromycin 12.5 mg/kg PO qds, furazolidine 1.25 mg/kg PO qds, or
co-trimoxazole 5-25 mg/kg PO bd, all for 3 days.
In pregnancy, use erythromycin 250 mg PO qds for 3 days;
furozolidine 100 mg PO qds for 3 days is an alternative.

Epidemiology of V. cholerae
V. cholerae serovar 01 is the causative agent of cholera. There are
two biotypes of the 01 serovar: classical and El Tor. Each of these
biotypes is further divided into three serotypes: Ogawa, Inaba, and
Hikojima. The classical biotype caused the first 6 cholera pandemics
in south Asia during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The El Tor
biotype was first recognized in 1906 but until 1963 was restricted to
Sulawesi in Indonesia. During the 1960s, the 7th pandemic started
with spread of the El Tor biotype, Inaba serotype, out of Indonesia
into South Asia, Africa, and, since 1991, Latin America. This biotype
has now replaced the classical biotype throughout much of the
world, except Bangladesh.
Other V. cholerae serovars cause a cholera-like illness. The 0139
serotype first appeared in southern India in 1992. Unlike other non01 strains, it causes cholera with similar epidemiological and
clinical pictures to 01. In Bangladesh, it is reported to affect mainly
adults. Previous exposure to the 01 serovar does not confer
protection.

Prevention:
Public health measures aimed at improving food and water hygiene
and sanitation are the most important factors. Currently, two oral
cholera vaccines are available (chapter 22) and are recommended for
travellers to areas known to have a cholera epidemic. The use of
vaccines in epidemics has not been fully evaluated and should not
deflect resources from treatment facilities and prevention of spread.

Health education:
Is essential in preventing outbreaks and limiting the spread of infection
during an outbreak. Advice should include food and water hygiene, as
well as other measures such as disinfecting patients' clothing by boiling
for 5 mins, drying out bedding in the sun, burying stools, etc. In larger
health centres, patient excreta may be mixed with disinfectant (e.g.
cresol) or acid before disposal in pit latrines. Semi-solid waste should

be incinerated. Funerals have been a source of spread and
preventative measures should be instigated to minimize the risk of
mourners arriving from uninfected areas and potential contamination
from ritual washing of the dead and funeral feasts.

The cholera outbreak
It is obligatory to notify the WHO of all cholera cases. Suspected cases
should be reported immediately by health authorities and laboratory
confirmation sent as soon as it is obtained. This should be followed by
weekly reports containing the number of new cases and deaths since
the last report, the cumulative totals for the year, and, if possible, the
age distribution and number of patients admitted to hospital, recorded
by region or other geographical division. This data should be sent to
WHO headquarters as well as to the appropriate regional office.
Usually, there is a national coordinating committee to implement and
regulate control and prevention measures, though often it is up to the
front-line doctors to initiate the process and maintain close
collaboration. Mobile control teams may be needed in inaccessible
areas or in countries with no national coordination and these are
responsible for establishing and operating temporary treatment
centres, training local staff, educating the public, carrying out
epidemiological studies, collecting stool, food, and water samples for
laboratory analysis, and providing emergency logistical support to
health posts and laboratories. Emergency treatment centres may be
needed if appropriate facilities do not exist or are swamped with
patients. Strict isolation or quarantine measures are not needed. The
most crucial factor affecting survival is access to treatment centres
with trained staff and intravenous and oral rehydration capability.

Other necessary supplies
2 large water dispensers with tap for bulk ORS
manufacture.
20 1-litre bottles, 20 half-litre bottles for ORS

5 kg cotton wool to sterilize skin (e.g. with 70%
alcohol) for IV access prior to insertion of cannulae.
3 reels of adhesive tape to secure IV cannulae and
NG tubes.

Giardiasis
Giardia intestinalis (also known as G. lamblia, G. duodenalis) is the
most common human protozoan GI pathogen, having a worldwide
distribution. Its prevalence can reach ~30% in the tropics, with
infection being highest in infants and children. It causes ~3% of
traveller's diarrhoea.

Transmission:
The cysts can survive for long periods outside the host in suitable
environments (e.g. surface water). Importantly they are NOT killed by
chlorination. Infection follows ingestion of cysts in faecally
contaminated water (rarely food) or through direct person to person
contact. Partial immunity may be acquired through repeated
infections.

Clinical features:
In endemic areas, asymptomatic carriers are common. Symptoms
usually begin within 3-20 days of infection; most patients recover
within 2-4 weeks, although in 25% of travellers, symptoms persist for
up to 7 weeks. Diarrhoea is the major symptom; it is watery initially,
becoming steatorrhoeic and often associated with nausea, abdominal
discomfort, bloating, weight loss, and sometimes sulfurous, offensive
burps. Giardiasis can be the cause of abdominal pain without diarrhoea
in children. Some patients develop a chronic diarrhoea associated with
weight loss of up to 20% of ideal body weight, fat malabsorption,
deficiencies (particularly of vitamins A and B12), and, in some cases,
2° hypolactasia.

Complications:
In hyperendemic settings, infections are universal and usually
asymptomatic but some studies have documented retardation of
growth and development in severely affected infants and children, in
whom malabsorption exacerbates malnutrition. Chronic giardiasis is
associated with allergic and inflammatory conditions such as lymphoid
nodular hyperplasia. Protein-losing enteropathy, lactose intolerance,
and irritable bowel syndrome can also occur.

Diagnosis:
detection of cysts (and occasionally trophozoites) in faecal samples by
light microscopy. Examine 3 separate samples, since cysts are excreted
only intermittently and diagnostic sensitivity is low. Trophozoites may
be detected in biopsies of small intestine mucosa. ELISA tests can
detect faecal Giardia antigens. Since mixed enteric infections and
asymptomatic carriage of Giardia is so common, identification of the
parasite does not guarantee that it is the causative agent of the
diarrhoea. Serology is not useful because of cross-reactivity in noninfected individuals in endemic areas.

Management
1. Rehydration and symptomatic relief are usually sufficient.
2. If symptoms persist, an anti-giardial drug will decrease the severity
and duration of symptoms. Drug failure due to resistance is
increasing. Recommended drugs include metronidazole 2 g od PO for
3 days, or tinidazole 2 g as a single oral dose.

Prevention:
Attention to personal hygiene, appropriate treatment of water
supplies, encouraging breastfeeding (shown to partially protect against
infection).

Cryptosporidiosis

The protozoon Cryptosporidium parvum is a common opportunistic
infection in HIV +ve patients. It is also a common cause of childhood
diarrhoea in the immunocompetent. Transmission is mainly through
contaminated water. It accounts for 2-20% of childhood diarrhoea in
the developing world, and infections contribute to growth faltering
during the first year of life. Although usually mild, severe or persistent
diarrhoea may occur.

Clinical features:
acute diarrhoea is indistinguishable from diarrhoea due to other
causes. Abdominal cramping pain is often a feature. Cryptosporidium
should be sought in persistent (chronic) diarrhoea; in AIDS patients it
may be severe, mimicking cholera, and/or be very prolonged.

Diagnosis:
faecal detection of the oocysts (4-6 µm diameter red spheres on
modified ZN stain). Oocysts can also be seen in sputum on occasions.
ELISA detection kits are available.

Management:
Rehydration with symptomatic relief; as yet, no drug has been shown
to be effective against this organism. Wider use of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in people with AIDS has reduced the
prevalence of severe cryptosporidiosis.

Cyclospora
Cyclospora cayetanensis
is a protozoan coccidian parasite now recognized to be a frequent
cause of diarrhoea in developing and developed countries.
Transmission is via contaminated water or food; raspberries, basil, and
lettuce have been incriminated.

Diagnosis:

is by finding typical oocysts in faeces which are 7-10 µm diameter and
contain a ‘morula’ of 8 spherical bodies. The oocysts are also
irregularly acid-fast when stained with modified Zn stain.

Clinical features:
watery diarrhoea which is most severe in non-immune travellers. Mild
fever, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss may occur. The illness can last
for weeks.

Management:
co-trimoxazole 960 mg PO bd for 7-10 days.

Strongyloidiasis
The nematode Strongyloides stercoralis commonly infects humans
worldwide, particularly in parts of S. America and S.E. Asia. It is a
serious condition in the immunosuppressed and may cause acute,
relapsing, or persistent diarrhoea. There are two adult forms of the
worm and two larval forms, one of which is infective.

Life cycle:
Complex (see Fig. 6.4) since reproduction can take place in either of
two cycles: an external cycle involving free-living worms or an internal
cycle. Contamination of skin or buccal mucosa with larvaecontaining
soil permits initial penetration of larvae and infection. The larvae
travel to the lungs and enter the bronchi, eventually passing into the
small intestine, where they mature into adults. Eggs produced by the
female pass out in the faeces and continue the external cycle.
Autoinfection occurs by either bronchial larvae producing progeny or
filariform larvae not passing out in the stool but reinvading bowel or
perianal skin. This can produce indefinite (>40 years) multiplication
within the host, not requiring further infection. The pre-patent period
from infection to the appearance of larvae in the stools is ~1 month.

Clinical features:

Infection is usually asymptomatic, except for autoinfection through
perianal skin. The immune response limits the infection to the small
bowel and also the number of adult worms.
Larval penetration causes petechial haemorrhages and pruritis at the
site of entry, frequently with a linear, red eruption (larva currens) as
the larvae migrate under the skin. This is normally transient, but may
be followed by congestion and oedema. A creeping urticarial rash may
occur in pre-sensitized individuals following re-infection. Symptoms
similar to bronchopneumonia with consolidation may result from larval
invasion of the lungs; it is accompanied by eosinophilia and resembles
TPE. Watery diarrhoea with mucus is a frequent symptom; its intensity
depends on worm burden. It often alternates with constipation. In
severe cases, chronic diarrhoea with malabsorption may ensue.
In the immunosuppressed, those co-infected with HTLV-1,
malnourished, or debilitated, massive tissue invasion may occur with
severe diarrhoea, ileus, hepatomegaly, and multi-system disease due
to blood/lymphatic spread (‘hyperinfection syndrome’). Granulomas
and/or abscesses occur in liver, kidneys, and lungs, and there may be
serous effusions; CNS involvement produces pyogenic meningitis and
encephalopathy. Eosinophilia may or may not be a feature. Death
usually results from Gram-negative septicaemia.

Diagnosis:
Adult or rhabditiform larvae may be detected in the stool, although
simple stool microscopy is an insensitive test. Other methods include
the modified Baermann technique, agar plate culture, ELISA, serology,
and stool culture using charcoal. Look for infection in those who are,
or are about to be, immunosuppressed (e.g. on steroids).

Management:
Treat all infected patients, not just the symptomatic.
1. Albendazole 400 mg PO bd for 7 days.
(Alternatives: ivermectin 200 mcg/kg PO od for 2 days; or
thiabendazole 25 mg/kg PO bd for 2 days, or 5 days in disseminated

infection.)

Prevention:
Requires improving hygiene, encouraging footware, and education on a
community level, as well as monitoring and evaluation.

Fig. 6.4 Life cycle of Strongyloides stercoralis: The female worms
are ~2 mm in length and live in the small intestine; they produce

eggs parthenogenetically. In the auto-infectious life cycle (A),
these hatch within the bowel and larvae penetrate the intestinal
wall to produce more adult worms. Alternatively (B), the larvae
may be passed in faeces into environmental surface water, and
infect new hosts through intact skin (when walking barefoot in
puddles). In a third life cycle (C), free-living adult worms give rise
to eggs and then larvae, which infect new hosts. Infective larvae
are called ‘filariform’, and those freshly passed in stool are
‘rhabtidiform’ larvae. (Adapted from G. Piekarski, Medical
parasitology in plates, 1962 and reproduced with kind permission

Food poisoning
Food Poisoning is a general term referring to gastrointestinal symptoms
which occur after eating specific foods. When symptoms occur within a
few hours of eating the food, this is usually due to a toxin present in
the food. Microbial infections usually have a longer incubation period
as the pathogen proliferates in the intestine.

Clostridium perfringens
Clostridium perfringens
produces two forms of gastrointestinal disease: simple food poisoning
(caused by type A, see box on page 238) and necrotizing enterocolitis
(type C).

Necrotizing enterocolitis (pigbel)
This is common in Uganda, South-East Asia, China, and the highlands of

Papua New Guinea. It occurs when C. perfringens type C is eaten,
normally in meat, by people who are malnourished, heavily infected
with Ascaris lumbricoides, or have a diet rich in sweet potatoes. The
latter two are associated with high levels of heat-stable trypsin
inhibitors that inhibit the luminal proteases, preventing them
inactivating the toxin.

Clinical features:
symptoms usually begin 48 h following ingestion but may start up to
one week later. It is classified into 4 types:
Type I (acute toxic) presents with fulminant toxaemia and shock. It
usually occurs in young children and carries an 85% mortality rate.
Type II (acute surgical) presents as mechanical or paralytic ileus,
acute strangulation, perforation, or peritonitis. It has 40% mortality.
Type III (subacute surgical) presents later, with features similar to
type II. Mortality is also ~40%.
Type IV is of mild diarrhoea only, though it may progress to type III.
In types II and III, a thickened segment of bowel is sometimes
palpable. Blood and pus are passed with the stool in severe disease.

Diagnosis:
isolation of C. perfringens from stool or peritoneal fluid culture.
Serological diagnosis is also possible.

Management:
type I and II disease require urgent surgery after appropriate
resuscitation. Surgery may also be required for type III. Give
intravenous chloramphenicol or benzylpenicillin and C. perfringens
type C antiserum, where available. Milder cases may require glucose
and electrolyte infusions, with IV broad-spectrum antibiotics if there
are signs of extra-intestinal spread. Give an antihelminthic effective
against Ascaris. Oral food intake should begin after 24 h.

Prevention:
immunization with type C toxoid has greatly reduced the incidence
and severity of the disease in Papua New Guinea.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of food poisoning from bacteria or
their toxins
Five key to safe food:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Keep food clean
Cook thoroughly
Separate raw and cooked food
Keep food at safe temperatures
Use safe water and raw materials

Food handlers should be particularly careful about
personal hygiene, especially hand washing after
defecation and before touching food. Especial
attention should be taken to prevent S. aureus
contamination from skin, nose, and eye infections of
food handlers, who are the most common source of
contamination of food (~25% people are carriers).
The toxin is not destroyed at boiling temperatures.

Persistent diarrhoea & malabsorption
Persistent diarrhoea (lasting >2 weeks) is the preferred term for
episodes starting acutely and associated with gastrointestinal
infections. Diarrhoea may be prolonged through several mechanisms
(see box opposite). In areas where sanitation and clean water are
lacking and diarrhoea incidence is high, most persistent diarrhoea
seems to be caused by frequent new infections combined with delayed
recovery, often due to nutrient deficiencies. Persistent diarrhoea is
accompanied by malnutrition and high mortality in children. Dietary

management with continued feeding, correction of micronutrient
deficiencies, and antimicrobial treatment of concomitant infections
and dysentery (as well as rehydration if necessary) is effective in 80%
of children.

Malabsorption
May be due to a range of causes (see box). The key features are:
Chronic diarrhoea and steatorrhoea: stool is typically loose, bulky,
offensive, greasy, light-coloured, and difficult to flush away.
Abdominal discomfort, distension, flatulence.
Signs of nutritional deficiency e.g. glossitis, pallor, muscle pain
bruising, hyperpigmentation, CNS or PNS signs, skeletal deformity.
General ill health: anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, dyspnoea,
fatigue.
Features related to underlying cause: surgical scars, systemic
disease.

Investigations:
FBC, U&Es, ESR, LFTs, stool microscopy and culture. Other tests
include faecal fat, INR (deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins),
carbohydrate absorption (after glucose or xylose), Schilling test
(measure of ileal function), small bowel biopsy via endoscopy, or
Crosby capsule.

Hypolactasia and lactose intolerance
1° hypolactasia occurs because humans, like most mammals, lose
the digestive enzyme lactase as they mature and no longer depend
on milk (although a genetic variant in some ethnic groups preserves
the enzyme).
2° hypolactasia occurs after injury to the intestinal mucosa and is
common after GI infections.
In both types a limited capacity to hydrolyse lactose leads to lactose

malabsorption. Lactose intolerance occurs when incompletely
hydrolysed lactose reaches the colon and causes osmotic diarrhoea,
abdominal pain, distention, and flatulence. Symptoms depend on the
amount of lactose reaching the small intestine at a given time.

Diagnosis:
History of worsening symptoms with increased lactose intake (lactose
tolerance test), acid stools with positive reducing substances, the
hydrogen breath test, or a lactase assay in jejunal biopsy.

Management:
Symptomatic intolerance can often be controlled by allowing only
small amounts of lactose at a time; slowing gastric emptying e.g. by
adding chocolate to milk or mixing milk with cereals; reducing lactose
by fermentation as in yogurt; or taking lactase supplements with milk
drinks. Total exclusion of milk to avoid lactose is rarely necessary and
should be avoided whenever possible in infants because it is often
difficult to provide alternative bio-available sources of the many
nutrients in milk. Care should be taken to maintain energy and
nutrient intakes. If, in
severe cases, it is necessary to eliminate lactose-containing products,
these may be introduced slowly after 6 weeks depending on symptom
recurrence.

Causes of persistent or chronic diarrhoea
Secondary events
Lactose intolerance due to 1° or 2° hypolactasia.
Tropical sprue.
Cow's milk protein intolerance.

Continuing infection
Strongyloidiasis.
Cryptosporidiosis.
Microsporidiosis.

Enteropathogenic E. coli.
Giardiasis.
Intestinal flukes.
Chronic intestinal schistosomiasis.

Delayed recovery
Malnutrition.
Zinc deficiency.
Sequential new infections.

Other causes
HIV enteropathy.
Chronic calcific pancreatitis.
Short bowel disease (e.g. recovered pigbel disease).
Ileocaecal TB.
Lymphoma — Burkitt's and Mediterranean.
Acute and chronic liver disease.
Inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease.
Irritable bowel syndrome.

Causes of malabsorption
Infective: acute enteritis, intestinal TB, parasitic infections,
Whipple's disease, other causes of traveller's diarrhoea.
Anatomical/motility: blind loops, diverticuli, strictures, fistulae,
small bowel lymphoma, systemic sclerosis, diabetes mellitus,
pseudoobstruction, radiotherapy, amyloidosis, lymphatic
obstruction (TB, lymphoma, cardiac disease).
Defective digestion: chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, food
sensitivity (lactose, gluten), malnutrition, gastric/intestinal
surgery, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pancreatectomy, biliary
obstruction, terminal ileal disease/resection (short bowel
syndrome), parenchymal liver disease, bacterial overgrowth.
Drugs: antibiotics, cholestyramine, metformin, methyldopa,

alcohol, antacids, purgative misuse, paraaminosalicylic acid.

Post-infective malabsorption (PIM); tropical
enteropathy; tropical sprue
This syndrome of malabsorption, haematological abnormality, weight
loss and diarrhoea can occur in residents and long-term visitors (>3
months) to the tropics, especially Central America, northern South
America, parts of Africa, the Mediterranean coast, Middle East, and
Asia. It is by definition a chronic condition; ≥2 months of symptoms are
needed to make the diagnosis. Malabsorption significantly reduces
energy and nutrient intake quickly leading to malnutrition, especially
in children, and to anaemia. For reasons that are not clear, PIM seems
to be becoming less common.

Aetiology:
PIM is an enigma. It is not clear whether it is a distinct entity which
occurs with the persistence of malabsorption after acute infective
diarrhoea, or a form of tropical enteropathy (tropical sprue; see
below). Both tropical enteropathy and PIM show abnormal jejunal
morphology with partial villous atrophy. There is crypt hyperplasia,
with T cell infiltration. Changes in gut hormones, disturbed gut
motility, and colonic function have been described. Bacterial
overgrowth of the small intestine is found but no single organism can
be held responsible. An association with certain HLA antigens has been
reported suggesting a genetic predisposition.

Clinical features:
chronic diarrhoea/steatorrhoea ± flatulence of >2 months duration.
Other features include weight loss, glossitis, macrocytic anaemia, fluid
retention, depression, lethargy, amenorrhoea, and infertility. Serum
folate and vitamin B12 may fall to very low levels. Hypoalbuminaemia
and oedema are late signs. Foreign travel or recent GI infection can
unmask other chronic GI disorders such as coeliac disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, and GI malignancy. Irritable bowel

syndrome is reported in 3-10% of people following travellers' diarrhoea
episodes.

Investigations:
1-h blood xylose concentration following a 5 g or 25 g loading dose; 72h faecal fat estimation; Schilling test; serum B12; RBC folate; serum
globin; and albumin. Exclude faecal parasites. Barium meal and followthrough will show dilated loops of jejunum with clumping of barium.
Endoscopy and jejunal biopsy may show a ridged or convoluted
mucosa, depending on the duration of the disease, with T lymphocyte
infiltration.

Management
Eliminate bacterial overgrowth with tetracycline 250 mg PO qds for at
least 2 weeks.
1. Aid mucosal recovery by providing folate supplements.
2. Provide a suitable diet to promote weight gain.
3. Give symptomatic relief in the acute stages:
Codeine phosphate 30 mg PO tds or
Loperamide 4 mg PO initially, then 2 mg after each loose stool.
Usual dose 6-8 mg od; maximum dose 16 mg od.

Fig. 6.5 Distribution of post-infective malabsorption (tropical
sprue).

Tropical enteropathy and subclinical
malabsorption
Individuals living in highly contaminated environments such as
commonly found in the tropics fight a constant battle against repeated
low-grade viral, bacterial, and parasitic gastrointestinal infections.
This is associated with chronic changes in the jejunal mucosa with
blunted villi and nutrient malabsorption which recover when the
subject leaves the contaminated environment. Tests of nutrient
absorption e.g. B12 and xylose absorption tests, are usually abnormal.
Tropical enteropathy probably contributes to child growth retardation
in developing countries together with energy and micronutrient
deficiencies and frequent infectious diseases. Improve ment of the
condition occurs spontaneously when travellers return to a clean
environment. In resident infants, mucosal changes improve with age
but persist into adulthood.

Chronic calcific pancreatitis
A syndrome of pancreatic calcification associated with both exocrine
and endocrine impairment, commonly encountered in the tropics,
especially equatorial Africa, southern India, and Indonesia. Its
aetiology is unknown, although childhood kwashiorkor, gastroenteritis,
excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, and ingestion of cassava
(Manhiot esculenta) have all been implicated.

Clinical features:
are of chronic malabsorption with weight loss, often associated with
DM (10% of diabetes in E&W Africa) and (sometimes severe) pain. There
is an association with pancreatic malignancy.

Management:
diabetic control, low-fat diet, and enzyme supplementation (e.g.
pancreatin BP 6 g PO with food; dose tailored to individual patient).

Intestinal lymphoma
A wide variety of lymphomas may affect the GI tract, originating in
either intestinal lymph nodes (e.g. Hodgkin's lymphoma) or mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphomas). Small bowel lymphoma
is a recognized complication of HIV/AIDS. Weight loss is a common
feature and nodal disease may be confused with intestinal TB, as X-ray
changes appear similar. Diagnosis requires biopsy.

Whipples disease
Whipples disease is a rare condition caused by the actinomycete
bacterium Tropheryma whippelii. Classically, there is weight loss,
diarrhoea, and malabsorption, but clinical features are protean and
often non-specific. Other features include fever, lymphadenopathy,
arthralgia (may be transient or migratory), uveitis, culture negative
endocarditis, coronary arteritis, myocarditis, and encephalopathy. A
histopathological diagnosis is often made incidentally on examination

of intestinal biopsy material showing granulomatous inflammation and
periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining deposits. PCR for the presence of T.
whippelii in affected tissues confirms the diagnosis. Treatment: 2
weeks ceftriaxone 1 g bd IV, then oral co-trimoxazole (alternatives:
tetracycline or minocycline) for 1 year.

Other causes of malabsorption
1. Lymphangiectasia:
lacteal dilatation (either 1° or 2° to abdominal malignancy) causes a
protein-losing enteropathy, hypoproteinaemia, and oedema. Diagnosis
requires small bowel biopsy. Treatment: low-fat diet.

2. Abetalipoproteinaemia:
a rare AR disorder, usually presenting in childhood due to defective
triglyceride transport from the liver and gut. Eventually, neurological
dysfunction (peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia) may follow.
Diagnosis is by small bowel biopsy and symptomatic treatment is with
low-fat diet and vitamin supplementation.

3. Intestinal parasites:
Many GI parasites (e.g. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Trichuris,
Strongyloides) can cause diarrhoea. Others (e.g. schistosomiasis,
trichinellosis, cysticercosis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis,
ecchinococcus) cause hepatic or pancreatic dysfunction. Pancreatic
duct obstruction may be caused by ascariasis.

Fig. 6.6 Mechanisms of Steatorrhoea.

Intestinal flukes
These pathogens are common throughout Asia (particularly S.E. Asia),
where their prevalence may reach 30% in certain populations. Children
are more heavily infected and prone to symptoms.
Fasciolopsiasis: Caused by Fasciolopsis buski; infection follows
ingestion of metacercaria attached to the seed pods of water plants
contaminated by human and pig faeces.
Echinostomiasis: At least 15 Echinostoma species infect humans via
the consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater snails, clams,

fish, and tadpoles. In N.E. Thailand, it is commonly associated with
Opisthorchis infection.
Heterophyasis: Numerous species of the small (2.5 mm) Heterophyes
flukes infect humans following consumption of raw aquatic foods
and/or insect larvae.

Clinical features:
The attachment of parasites to the intestinal mucosa results in
inflammation and ulcer formation. Infections are frequently
asymptomatic; when symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and
non-specific — diarrhoea, flatulence, mild abdominal pains, vomiting,
fever, and anorexia. Fasciolopsiasis may produce severe disease with
anaemia, malabsorption, oedema, and ascites. Eggs (and sometimes
adult worms) of Heterophyes spp. may enter the lymphatics after
mucosal penetration and be transported to other sites (notably heart,
spinal cord, brain, lungs, liver, and spleen) where they cause
granulomatous reactions. Myocarditis and neurological deficits may
result.

Diagnosis:
Faecal examination for eggs, after concentration. Differentiation
between F. hepatica, F. buski, and echinostomes is often difficult.
Similarly, heterophydiae eggs closely resemble those of Clonorchis and
Opisthorchis. Recovery of adult worms from post-treatment faeces
allows a definitive diagnosis, although in the case of the heterophyids,
this is difficult owing to their small size. Extraintestinal cases of
heterophyiasis are also difficult to diagnose — they are often only
revealed during surgery or autopsy.

Management
1. Praziquantel is the drug of choice, given as 25 mg/kg PO tds for 1
day.
2. Mebendazole or albendazole may be used for echinostomiasis,
although praziquantel is recommended in areas where other

trematodes are present, due to its broad efficacy.

Prevention:
Concentrate on breaking the faeco-oral cycle (e.g. stopping the use of
human and pig excreta as fertilizer) possibly combined with
community-based praziquantel treatment and education regarding the
consumption of raw/undercooked foodstuffs.

General management of dehydration
Dehydration due to diarrhoea remains a major cause of childhood
death in the developing world. The volume of fluid lost in the stool can
vary from 5 ml/kg to >200 ml/kg in 24 h. Electrolyte loss also varies.
The total body sodium deficit in young children with severe
dehydration owing to secretory diarrhoea is usually about 70-110 mmol

per litre of water lost.
The degree of dehydration is graded according to clinical features. In
the early stages of dehydration, there are no signs or symptoms. As
dehydration increases, thirst, restless, or irritable behaviour develop.
Examination reveals decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes,
sunken eyes, sunken fontanelle (in infants), and absence of tears when
crying. In severe dehydration, these effects become more pronounced
and the patient may develop signs of hypovolaemic shock, including
decreased consciousness, anuria, cool moist extremities, rapid and
feeble pulse, low blood pressure, and peripheral cyanosis. Death may
follow swiftly without prompt rehydration.

Types of dehydration
1. Isotonic dehydration: occurs most frequently and is due to net losses
of water and sodium in similar proportion to that in the extracellular
fluid (ECF). The serum sodium concentration (130-150 mmol/l) and
serum osmolality (275-295 mOsmol/l) are normal. Hypovolaemia
occurs due to excess ECF losses. Clinical features are those of
hypovolaemic shock (e.g. thirst, reduced skin turgor, dry mucous
membranes, sunken eyes, oliguria, and a sunken fontanelle in
infants). This progresses to anuria, hypotension, a weak pulse, cool
extremities, and eventually coma and death.
2. Hypertonic (hypernatraemic) dehydration: reflects a net loss of
water in excess of sodium and tends to occur in infants only. It
usually results from attempted treatment of diarrhoea with fluids
that are hypertonic (e.g. sweetened fruit juices/soft drinks, glucose
solution) combined with insufficient intake of water and other
hypotonic solutes. Hypertonic solutions cause water to flow from the
ECF into the intestine, leading to decreased ECF volume and
hypernatraemia. There is a deficit of water, hypernatraemia (Na
>150 mmol/l), and raised serum osmolality (>295 mOsmol/l). Clinical
features include severe thirst, irritability and convulsions (esp. if
Na+ is >165 mmol/l).
3. Hypotonic (hyponatraemic) dehydration: occurs in patients with
diarrhoea who drink large amounts of water or other hypotonic

fluids containing very low quantities of salt and other solutes. and in
patients who receive IV infusions of 5% glucose in water. It occurs
because water is absorbed from the gut while the loss of salt
continues, producing a net excess of water and hyponatraemia.
Serum sodium and osmolality are low (Na+ <130 mmol/l, Osm <275
mOsmol/l). Clinical features include lethargy and, rarely,
convulsions.
All three types of dehydration can be managed with the same oral
rehydration fluid and intravenous regimes described on the following
pages.

Plan B (see p. 254)

Plan C (see p. 256)

3. Decide:

4. Treat:

Plans B and C require at least two of the four signs to be positive
Notes:
1

A lethargic patient is not simply asleep; the patient's mental state is dull and the
patient cannot be fully awakened. The patient may appear to be drifting into

unconsciousness.
2

In some infants, the eyes normally appear a little sunken, so ask the mother if the
child's eyes appear normal to her.
3

Pinch the abdominal skin in a longitudinal manner with thumb and bent forefinger.
‘Goes back slowly’ means that it is visible for more than 2 seconds.

Fig. 6.8 Skin pinch to assess skin turgor. Pinch skin midway
between umbilicus and flank, then release skin to observe how
quickly it goes back. Skin pinch returns very slowly (≥2 seconds) in
severe dehydration due to reduced skin turgor. (Reproduced from
Management of the Child with a Serious Infection or Severe
Malnutrition with permission from the WHO.)

Estimation of fluid deficit
A child's fluid deficit may be estimated as follows:
Assessment

Fluid deficit as % body weight

Fluid deficit ml/kg

No signs of dehydration

<5%

<50 ml/kg

Some dehydration

5-10%

50-100 ml/kg

Severe dehydration

>10%

>100 ml/kg

Children with dehydration should be weighed without clothing, as an
aid to estimating their fluid requirements. If weighing is not possible,
the child's age may be used to estimate the weight. Treatment should
never be delayed because scales are not readily available.

Suitable fluids
Many countries have recommended home fluids which should be used
in the prevention of dehydration only (i.e. treatment plan A).
Whenever possible, these should include at least one fluid that
normally contains salt (e.g. oral rehydration solution — ORS; salted
drinks such as salted rice water or salted yoghurt; vegetable or chicken
soup with salt). Other fluids should be recommended that are
frequently given to children in the area, that mothers consider
acceptable for children with diarrhoea, and that the mothers would
likely give in increased amounts if advised to do so. Such fluids should
be safe and easy to prepare.
If there are signs of dehydration, ORS should be used as per treatment
plans B and C.
Teaching mother to add salt (about 3 g/l) to unsalted drinks or soups
during diarrhoea is beneficial, but requires education and (initially)
supervision. Teach the mother to ALWAYS taste the fluid herself
before giving it to the child. It should not taste saltier than tears.
A home-made solution containing 3 g/l salt and 18 g/l of common
sugar (sucrose) is effective, but the recipe is often forgotten, made
up incorrectly, and/or the ingredients hard to obtain.

Unsuitable fluids
A few fluids are potentially dangerous and should be avoided during
episodes of diarrhoea. Avoid drinks sweetened with sugar that can
cause osmotic diarrhoea and hypernatraemia (e.g. soft drinks, Cola,
sweetened fruit drinks, sweetened tea).

Oral rehydration solution (ORS)
The formula for ORS recommended by WHO and UNICEF is given in the

box opposite. Where bulk preparation is required, multiply the
amounts shown by the number of litres required. WHO-ORS is also
available in pre-prepared packets for dissolution in water. ORS should
be used within 24 h of preparation. When given correctly, ORS provides
sufficient water and electrolytes to correct the deficits associated with
acute diarrhoea. For children with severe malnutrition, a solution
containing 45 mmol sodium (ReSoMal, see formula in box opposite) is
preferred.

ORS recipe: to make 1L from bulk ingredients
1. Sodium chloride

3.5 g

2. Glucose

20 g

3. Trisodium citrate, dihydrate

2.9 g

4. Potassium chloride

1.5 g

If glucose and trisodium citrate are not available, use:
Sucrose

27 g

Sodium bicarbonate

2.5 g

Completely dissolve the sugar and salts in one litre of clean water
— boiled or chlorinated water is best.
ORS solution should be used within 24 h, after which time it
should be discarded and fresh solution prepared.
To make 1 litre of rice-based ORS, boil 50 g of rice powder in 1.1
litres of water. Mix in sugar and salt in the quantities stated
above. Use within 12 h.

Dehydration in children with malnutrition
Signs of dehydration are more difficult to assess in children with
severe malnutrition, and can be difficult to distinguish from signs of
sepsis. As a result, the degree of dehydration is often
overestimated.

Eyes appear sunken because of the absence of orbital fat. Ask the
mother if there has been a change.
Skin turgor is more difficult to assess by skin pinch because of
oedema in kwashiorkor and redundant skin in marasmus, but the
characteristic dough-like feel of severe dehydration may still be
useful.
Thirst is a useful sign if present. Check by offering water or ORS
rather than by asking. Inability to drink also occurs in sepsis.
Lethargy and coma may be due to sepsis.
Use ReSoMal (rehydration solution for severely dehydrated
children) for oral/NG rehydration if available. This has less Na+
and more K+.
Reserve intravenous fluids for dehydration with shock; give at half
the rate for non-malnourished children (15 ml/kg in the first
hour). Monitor every 15 min (pulse, respiratory rate, signs of
dehydration). If no improvement in hydration status after 1 hour
of IV rehydration, reduce fluid replacement rate to 4 ml/kg/hour
and assume sepsis.
If in doubt, start parenteral antibiotics.

ReSoMal recipe
Mix the same quantity of electrolytes used to make 1 litre ORS* (see
box above) with 2 litres of water, 50 g sucrose, and 45 ml of KCl
solution (100 g KCL/1 litre)**

Treatment plan A: treat diarrhoea without signs
of dehydration at home
Use this plan to teach the mother to:
Continue to treat her child's current episode of diarrhoea at home.
Give early treatment for future episodes of diarrhoea.
Counsel the mother on the 4 rules of home treatment:

1) GIVE EXTRA FLUID
(as much as the child will take)
Breastfeed frequently and for longer at each feed.
If exclusively breastfed, give ORS or clean water in addition to
breastmilk.
If not exclusively breastfed, give one or more of the following: ORS
solution, food-based fluids (such as soup, rice water, and yoghurt
drinks), or clean water.
It is especially important to give ORS at home when:
The child has been treated with Plan B or Plan C during this visit.
The child cannot return to a clinic if the diarrhoea gets worse.
▶ Teach the mother how to mix and give ORS. Give the mother 2
packets of ORS to use at home.
▶ Show the mother how much fluid to give in addition to the usual
fluid intake.

Amount of ORS to give according to child's age
Age

After each loose stool

At home

<2 yrs

50-100 ml

500 ml/day

2-10 yrs

100-200 ml

1 litre/day

>10 yrs

As much as tolerated

2 litres/day

Tell the mother to:
Give a teaspoon every 1-2 minutes for a child <2 yrs.
Give frequent small sips from a cup for older children.
Wait 10 minutes if the child vomits, then continue, but more slowly.
Continue giving extra fluid until the diarrhoea stops.

2) GIVE ZINC SUPPLEMENTS
▶ Tell the mother how much zinc to give:
<6 months → 2 tablets (10 mg total) per day for 14 days.
≥6 months → 4 tablets (20 mg total) per day for 14 days.
▶ Show the mother how to give zinc supplements
Infants → dissolve the tablet in a small amount of expressed
breastmilk, ORS, or clean water, in a small cup or spoon.
Older children → tablets can be chewed or dissolved in a small
amount of clean water in a cup or spoon.
▶ Remind the mother to give the zinc supplements for the full 14 days.

3) CONTINUE FEEDING
Give the child plenty of food to prevent malnutrition.
Continue to breastfeed frequently. If the child is not breastfed, give
the usual milk.
If the child is >6 months, or already taking solid foods, also give
cereal or another starchy food mixed, if possible, with pulses,
vegetables, milk, meat, or fish. Give fresh fruit juice or mashed
banana to provide potassium. Give freshly prepared foods. Cook and
mash/grind food well.
Encourage the child to eat; offer food >5 times per day.
Give the same foods after diarrhoea stops and give an extra meal
each day for 2 weeks.

4) WHEN TO RETURN
Take the child to a health worker if the diarrhoea does not improve
within 3 days or the child develops any of the following:
Many watery stools.
Fever.

Repeated vomiting.
Eating/drinking poorly.
Unable to breastfeed.
Marked thirst.
Blood in the stool.

What to do if patient does not improve with ORT
In about 5% of patients the signs of dehydration do not improve or
worsen after starting treatment with ORS. The usual causes are:
Continuing rapid stool loss (>15-20 ml/kg/hr) e.g. in cholera.
Insufficient ORS intake due to fatigue, lethargy, or lack of
supervision.
Frequent severe vomiting.
Such patients should be admitted to hospital and given ORS by NG
tube or Ringer's lactate solution 75 ml/kg IV over 4 h. Consider the
possibility of cholera. Close monitoring of patient's progress, hourly
at first, is essential.

When not to give ORS
Rarely, ORS should not be given. This is true for children with:
Abdominal distension due to paralytic ileus (often owing to opiate
drugs such as codeine or loperamide, or to hypokalaemia).
Glucose malabsorption, indicated by a marked increase in stool
output as ORS is started. There is no improvement and the stool
contains large amounts of glucose.
In these situations, rehydration should be given intravenously until
diarrhoea subsides.

Treatment plan B: treat some dehydration with
ORS

In clinic, give the recommended amount of ORS over a 4-hour period:
▶ Determine the amount of ORS to give during the first 4 h:
Age*

<4 mths

4-11 mths

12-23 mths

2-5 yrs

5-14 yrs

>14 yrs

Weight

<6 kg

6-9.9 kg

10-11.9 kg

12-19 kg

19-30 kg

>30 kg

Volume

200-400 ml

400-700 ml

700-900 ml

900-1400 ml

1.4-2.2 l

2.2-4.0 l

*

Use the child's age only when you do not know the weight. The approximate amount of
ORS required (in ml) can also be calculated by multiplying the child's weight (in kg) × 75.

If the child wants more ORS than shown, give more.
For infants <6 months who are not breastfed, also give 100-200 ml
clean water during this period.
▶ Show the mother how to give ORS solution
Give a teaspoon every 1-2 mins for a child under 2 years.
Give frequent small sips from a cup for an older child.
If the child vomits, wait 10 minutes; then continue, but more slowly.
Continue breastfeeding whenever the child wants.
▶ After 4 h, reassess the patient using the chart on
continue plan A, B, or C as appropriate

p 249 and

If there are no signs of dehydration, shift to plan A. When
dehydration has been corrected, urine will start to be passed and
children may become less irritable and fall asleep.
If signs indicating some dehydration are still present, repeat plan B,
but start to offer food, milk, and juice as in plan A.
If there are signs indicating severe dehydration, treat using plan C.
▶ If the mother must leave before completing treatment:
Show her how to prepare ORS solution at home.
Show her how much ORS to give to finish 4-hour treatment at home.

Give her enough ORS packets to complete rehydration. Also give her
2 packets as recommended in plan A.
Make sure that children receive breast milk or, if >6 months, are
given some food before being sent home. Emphasize to the mother
the importance of continuing feeding throughout the diarrhoeal
episode.
Explain the 4 rules of home treatment:
1. GIVE EXTRA FLUID (see plan A for recommended fluids)
2. GIVE ZINC SUPPLEMENTS
3. CONTINUE FEEDING
4. WHEN TO RETURN

Monitoring signs during oral rehydration
therapy
Check the patient from time to time during
rehydration to ensure that ORS is being taken
satisfactorily and that signs of dehydration are not
worsening. If at any time the patient develops
severe dehydration, switch to treatment plan C. After
4 h, reassess the patient following the guidelines in
the box on
p 249. Decide what treatment to give
next.
If signs of severe dehydration have appeared, IV
therapy should be started immediately, following
plan C. This is very unusual, however. It tends to
occur in children who drink ORS poorly and
continue to pass large volumes of watery stool
during the rehydration period.
If the patient still has signs of mild dehydration,
continue oral rehydration therapy following plan B.
At the same time start to offer food, milk, and

other fluids as described in treatment plan A.
Reassess the patient frequently.
If there are no signs of dehydration, the patient
should be considered fully rehydrated. If this is the
case: the skin pinch is normal; the thirst has
subsided; urine is passed normally; and the child is
no longer irritable and may fall asleep.
Teach the mother to treat her child at home using
ORS following plan A. Give her enough ORS sachets
for 3 days and teach her the signs that indicate she
must bring her child back to the health post.
Meeting normal fluid needs
While treatment to replace the existing water and electrolyte
deficit is in progress, the child's normal daily fluid requirements
must also be met. This may be done as follows:
Breastfed infants: continue to breastfeed as often and as long as
the infant wants to, even during oral rehydration therapy.
Non-breastfed infants <6 months of age: during rehydration with
ORS, give 100-200 ml of plain water by mouth. After completing
rehydration, resume full-strength milk or formula feeds. Give
water and other fluids normally taken by the infant.
Older children and adults: throughout rehydration treatment,
offer as much plain water, milk, or juice as is accepted, in
addition to ORS.

Treatment plan C: treat severe dehydration
quickly

Fig. 6.9 Treatment plan C. (Taken from Diarrhoea Treatment
Guidelines for clinic-based Healthcare Workers, 2005, with
permission of the WHO.)

Monitoring IV rehydration therapy
Patients should be reassessed every 15-20 mins until a strong radial
pulse is present. Thereafter, they should be assessed hourly to
confirm that hydration is improving. If it is not, the IV fluid may be
run at a faster rate.
When the planned amount of IV fluid has been given (6 h for infants,
3 h for older patients), the patient's state of hydration should be
reassessed using the chart on
p 249.
If the child's eyelids become puffy, liver enlarges, or tachycardia
and tachypnoea appear, these may be signs of fluid overload and
cardiac failure, especially in malnourished children. Reduce the
rate of IV infusion and monitor closely.
If there are still signs of severe dehydration, repeat plan C. This is
unusual, but may occur in cases of cholera and children who pass
frequent, watery stools during the rehydration period.
If the patient shows signs of mild dehydration, discontinue IV fluid
replacement and commence oral rehydration with ORS for 4 h
according to plan B.
If there are no signs of dehydration, discontinue IV therapy and
commence ORS treatment according to plan A.
Observe the patient for at least 6 h before discharging. For children,
ensure that the mother is able to continue giving ORS at home and
is aware of the signs that indicate she must bring the child back.

Alternative solutions for IV rehydration
Ringer's lactate solution with 5% dextrose — provides glucose to
help prevent hypoglycaemia. If available, it is preferred to

Ringer's lactate solution without dextrose.
Physiological saline (0.9% NaCl, also called normal saline) — widely
available, it is an acceptable alternative to Ringer's lactate
solution but contains neither a base to correct acidosis nor
potassium to correct K+ losses. Sodium bicarbonate or sodium
lactate (20-30 mmol/l) and potassium chloride (5-15 mmol/l) may
be added.
Half-strength Darrow's solution — is made by diluting full-strength
Darrow's solution with an equal volume of glucose solution (50 g/l
or 100 g/l). Note that it contains less sodium than is required to
replace the sodium lost in diarrhoea.
Plain glucose (dextrose) solution should NOT be used — since it
does not contain any sodium, base, or potassium and does not
correct hypovolaemia effectively.

Some difficulties encountered in home therapy
for diarrhoea
1. The mother is disappointed because the child
is not prescribed an antibiotic or given an
injection
Explain that diarrhoea will usually stop by itself after a few days. The
zinc supplements will help the child get better quicker. In most cases,
antibiotics do not help and sometimes can make the diarrhoea go on
longer. It is better to see how the child progresses and, if necessary,
check to see what germ is causing the diarrhoea so that if antibiotics
are needed the doctor can give the right one. Fluid replacement and
continued feeding will help shorten the illness and maintain her child's
strength and growth.

2. The mother believes that food should not be
given during diarrhoea.

Ask her to explain her beliefs about how diarrhoea should be treated.
Discuss with her the importance of feeding in order to keep her child
strong and growing, even during diarrhoea. There are almost always
some foods which are acceptable — find out and encourage these
alternatives.

3. The mother does not know what fluids to give
her child at home.
Ask her what fluids she can prepare at home and reach an agreement
on appropriate fluids for her child.

4. The mother does not have the ingredients to
make a recommended fluid.
Ask her if she can obtain the necessary ingredients easily. If she
cannot, suggest another home fluid.

5. The child vomits after drinking ORS or other
fluids.
Explain that more fluid is usually kept down than is vomited. Tell her
to wait 10 mins and then start giving fluid again, but more slowly, just
sips at a time from a spoon or cup.

6. The child refuses to drink.
A child who has lost fluid and is dehydrated will usually be thirsty and
want to drink, even when there are no signs of dehydration. If the
child is not familiar with the taste of ORS, some persuasion and
patience may be needed at first. When a child drinks well to begin
with but then loses interest, it usually means that sufficient fluid has
been given. If the child is not dehydrated, it is not necessary to insist
on ORS; other clear fluids can be given as suggested on
p 250.

7. The mother is given some ORS packets for use

at home but is afraid they will be used up
before the diarrhoea stops.
Explain that after the ORS has been used up she should give a
recommended home fluid (e.g. rice water) or water or she should
return to the health facility for more packets of ORS. In any event, she
should continue to give extra fluid until the diarrhoea stops.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Summary of important points in the
management of diarrhoea in children
Infectious diarrhoea very common, esp. ages 6
months — 2 years.
Always examine the child and follow WHO
guidelines for assessing hydration status ( p
249).
Keep in mild the possibility of other non-infectious
causes such as intussusception, appendicitis.
Exclusively breastfed babies may have frequent
explosive diarrhoea-like stools but appear well, are
not dehydrated, do not lose weight, and usually
follow a similar daily pattern of stooling.
Treat dysentery (visible blood in stools) with
antibiotics.
Avoid antibiotics in non-dysenteric diarrhoea unless
severe diarrhoea in a high-risk group (neonates,
immune compromised).
Avoid antimotility drugs (loperamide) in children
under 2 yrs.
Give oral zinc supplements: 20 mg elemental zinc
daily for 10-14 days (10 mg daily in children <6
months).

Continue breastfeeding.
Continue normal diet, fractioning* diet, and
increasing frequency of servings. Reduce lactose if
necessary by mixing milk with other foods. Do not
dilute formula with water.
Advise caretaker of signs of alarm in small children:
Undue sleepiness.
Abdominal distention.
Worsening of diarrhoea.
Fever.
Drinking poorly or unable or unwilling to
breastfeed.
Visible blood in stools.
Use all opportunities of contact with carers of
young children to advise preventative measures:
Exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months.
Introduce complementary foods from 6 months.
Continue breastfeeding together with other foods
to 2 years.
Give locally appropriate nutritional advice to
ensure sufficient calories and micronutrients.
Wash hands frequently with soap.
Dispose of infant stools safely, use potties, avoid
faecal contamination of play areas.
Make up infants' food fresh for each meal.
Avoid storing prepared food and bottles at room
temperature.
Boil water for children if clean water source is not
guaranteed.

Management of persistent diarrhoea
This is diarrhoea with or without blood that begins acutely and lasts
>14 days. Clinically, these episodes cannot be differentiated from
sequential episodes of acute diarrhoea over a prolonged period, but
the management is the same. It is usually associated with weight loss
and, often, with serious non-intestinal infections. Many children with
persistent diarrhoea are malnourished before the diarrhoea starts.
Persistent diarrhoea almost never occurs in infants who are exclusively
breastfed. Take a careful history and examine the patient well.
The object of treatment is to restore weight gain and normal intestinal
function. In most cases, the patient will need to be admitted to
hospital for diagnostic tests, treatment, and observation.

Treatment of persistent diarrhoea
1. Appropriate fluids
to prevent/treat dehydration (See

p 248-257).

2. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy
to treat diagnosed infections, in particular non-intestinal infections in
children (e.g. pneumonia, otitis media, UTI). Look for evidence of
Giardia, Shigella, or Entamoeba infection.

3. A nutritious diet
that does not cause worsening of the diarrhoea. Children will require a
minimum of 110 calories/kg per day, which may have to be given via a
NG tube if the child is too weak or refuses to eat. For infants <6
months, encourage exclusive breastfeeding but check the baby is
gaining weight. If possible help mothers who are not breastfeeding to
re-establish lactation (See
Chapter 17).

4. Where possible, replace animal milk

with yoghurt, a lactose-free formula, or a local diet with reduced
lactose (<3.5 g/kg body weight/day). For older infants and young
children, use standard diets made from local ingredients. Two diets are
given in the box: the first contains reduced lactose, the second is
lactose-free for the 30% of children who do not improve with the first
diet.

5. Supplementary vitamins and minerals.
All children with persistent diarrhoea should receive supplementary
multivitamins and minerals each day for 2 weeks. Tablets that are
crushed and mixed with food are less costly. One should aim to provide
at least two recommended daily allowances (RDAs) of folate, vitamin
A, iron, zinc, magnesium, and copper. As a guide, the RDAs for a 1year-old child are:
Folate 150 mcg.
Zinc 10 mg.
Iron 10 mg.
Vitamin A 400 mcg.
Copper 1 mg.
Magnesium 80 mg.

Malnutrition and diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is as much a nutritional disease as one of fluid and
electrolyte loss. Children who die from diarrhoea, despite good
management, are usually malnourished — often severely so.
During diarrhoea, decreased food intake, decreased nutrient
absorption, and increased nutrient requirements often combine to
cause weight loss and failure to grow. The child's nutritional status
declines and any pre-existing malnutrition is made worse.
Malnutrition itself makes diarrhoea worse, prolonging it and making
it more frequent. This vicious cycle may be broken by continuing to
give nutrient-rich foods during diarrhoea and giving a nutritious
diet, appropriate for the child's age, when the child is well.
When these steps are followed, malnutrition can be either
prevented or corrected and the risk of death from a future episode
of diarrhoea is much reduced.

Complications of diarrhoea
Electrolyte disturbances
Knowing the serum electrolyte concentrations rarely changes the
management of patients dehydrated due to diarrhoea. In most cases,
hypernatraemia, hyponatraemia, and hypokalaemia are all adequately

treated by oral rehydration with ORS or IV rehydration with Ringer's
lactate. In severe dehydration, however, plasma sodium
concentrations may reach extremes and hypokalaemia may produce
muscular weakness, dangerous cardiac arrhythmias, and paralytic
ileus.

Fever
Fever in a patient with diarrhoea may be due to the organism causing
the diarrhoea or, particularly in children, a 2° infection (e.g.
pneumonia, otitis media, malaria). The presence of fever should
suggest infections, particularly if it persists after the patient is fully
hydrated. In areas where P. falciparum malaria is prevalent, children
with a fever of ≥38°C should be treated with an appropriate
antimalarial. High fevers (>39°C) in children should be treated with an
antipyretic such as paracetamol. This will reduce irritability and
prevent febrile convulsions.

Convulsions
In a child with diarrhoea and convulsions during the illness, the
following diagnoses should be considered:
Febrile convulsions: usually occur in children aged 6 months to 6
years (
p 15). Treat with paracetamol and tepid water sponging.
Meningitis: needs to be considered in any child or adult following a
convulsion. Look for neck rigidity and Kernig's sign. Do a lumbar
puncture after checking the retinae for papilloedema (raised ICP)
and looking for focal neurological signs.
Hypoglycaemia: occasionally occurs in children with diarrhoea, due
to their small hepatic glycogen reserves and insufficient
gluconeogenesis. If suspected, give 2-5 ml/kg of 10% glucose solution
(or 2.5 ml/kg of a 20% glucose solution) IV over 5 mins. If
hypoglycaemia is the cause, recovery will usually be rapid. In such
cases, Ringer's lactate with dextrose should be given to the child for
IV rehydration. Give carbohydrates as soon as possible to restore
liver glycogen.

Shigellosis: Shigella infections can sometimes cause convulsions. Do
stool culture for shigella.

Vitamin A deficiency
Diarrhoea reduces the absorption of, and increases the need for,
vitamin A. In areas where vitamin A deficiency is already prevalent,
young children with diarrhoea have an increased risk of developing eye
problems. Treat if vitamin A deficiency common locally or suspected
clinically.

Doses:
50,000 iu for children <6 months; 100,000 iu for children 6-12 months;
200,000 iu for children >12 months. Give dose on day 1, day 2, and 14
days later or at discharge.

Metabolic acidosis
During episodes of diarrhoea, a large amount of bicarbonate may be
lost from the stool. If renal function is normal, this will be replaced.
However, renal impairment due to hypovolaemia may result in the
rapid development of acidosis. Poor tissue perfusion → excess lactate
production. Features of metabolic acidosis are: respiratory
compensation (look for deep ‘Kussmaul’ breathing ± tachypnoea);
vomiting; low serum bicarbonate (<10 mmol/l); acidaemia (pH <7.3).

Antidiarrhoeal drugs
These agents, though commonly used, have no practical benefit and
are never indicated for the treatment of acute diarrhoea in
children. Some of them are dangerous.
Adsorbents: (e.g. kaolin, attapulgite, smectite, activated
charcoal, cholestyramine) are of no proven value in the
treatment of diarrhoea.
Antimotility drugs: (e.g. loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine,
tincture of opium, paregoric, codeine) reduce the frequency of
stool passage in adults, but do not do so appreciably in children.

Moreover, they may cause severe paralytic ileus and prolong
infection by delaying the elimination of the causative
organism/toxin. Loperamide is useful in traveller's diarrhoea in
adults; it should never be used in infants.

Other drugs
Antiemetics (e.g. prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine,
metaclopramide) should not be given since they often cause
sedation and may interfere with ORS treatment. Vomiting will
cease as the patient becomes hydrated.
Cardiac stimulants should never be used to overcome shock and
hypotension which may occur in severe dehydration with
hypovolaemia. Cardiac output will be restored by fluid
resuscitation.
Blood or plasma is only indicated if there is proven shock.
Steroids and purgatives are of no benefit and should not be used.

Prevention of diarrhoea
Proper treatment of diarrhoeal diseases is highly effective in
preventing death, but has no impact on the incidence of such diseases.
Teach family members to adopt preventative measures. Do not
overload the mother with technical advice, but emphasize the most
important points for each particular mother and child.

1. Measures that interrupt the transmission of
pathogens
The infectious agents that cause diarrhoea are usually transmitted by
the faeco-oral route. Measures to interrupt transmission should focus
on:
Giving only breast milk for the first 6 months of life.
Avoiding the use of infant feeding bottles and dummies.
Improving practices relating to the preparation and storage of

weaning foods (to minimize microbial contamination).
Using only clean water for drinking.
Washing hands after defecation and disposal of faeces, and before
preparing food.
Disposing of all faeces in a safe manner.

2. Measures that strengthen host defences
Continuing to breastfeed for the first 2 years of life.
Improving a child's nutritional status by giving more nutritious food,
including foods of animal origin that contain essential minerals such
as zinc and other micronutrients. Giving complementary foods more
often, from 3 times per day when first introduced at 6 months to 5
times per day at 12 months.
Immunizing against measles.
Immunizing against rotavirus.

3. How doctors can help to prevent diarrhoea
Ensure appropriate in-service training of health facility staff.
Make sure that all staff are giving consistent messages on diarrhoea
prevention and infant feeding.
Display promotional material on how to treat and prevent diarrhoea.
Be a good role model (breastfeeding, hand washing, water hygiene,
latrine hygiene).
Take part in community-based activities to promote health.
Co-ordinate efforts for disease prevention with those of relevant
government programmes.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Household strategies for safe drinking water
Provision of safe drinking water requires a safe water

source and a safe storage system. Clean water alone
is not enough; food hygiene and hand washing are
also essential measures to reduce diarrhoea.
Boiling: Bring water to rolling boil for 1 min and
allow to cool. Most effective sterilization method:
kills most microbes even at high altitude. But it is
slow, expensive, requires 71 kg firewood/litre,
contributes to deforestation, danger of scalding,
and recontamination is possible.
Chlorination: Add 0.5-1.0 mg/l sodium hypochlorite
solution (e.g. liquid laundry bleach, but check no
other ingredients), mix well, and leave for 30 mins
to kill all bacteria, viruses, and most protozoa;
longer exposure in tightly closed container kills E.
hystolytica and Giardia spp. and reduces chlorine
taste; not effective against cryptosporidia. Works
less well (requires more time) when water is turbid:
works best if turbid water filtered or sediment left
to settle first. Taste may reduce acceptability.
During disinfection, use two containers: while one
is in use, the water in the other remains exposed
to the chlorine increasing the effectiveness against
viruses and protozoa and also reducing the chlorine
taste.
Iodination: 8 mg/l iodine sterilizes most microbes
within 10-30 mins at 20°C; longer periods for
colder water; and up to 8 h to ensure complete
sterilization. Taste may reduce acceptability.
Sand Filtration (0.15-0.3 mm particles ≥0.5 m
deep, either in a settling tank or a specially
designed receptacle): Removes particulate matter
and 750% bacteria, 20% viruses, and 50%

protozoa (not cryptosporidia oocysts). Cotton cloth
filters remove ~50% bacteria but less effective for
viruses and oocysts. Both methods remove the
copepod vector of dracunculiasis. Helpful as
preliminary stage before boiling or chlorination.
Ceramic filters: Require 1 µm pore size; use a
coarser filter first if water turbid to prevent
clogging. Relatively expensive. Ideally, boil water
first.
Sunlight UV-irradiation: Put 0.5-1 litre water in
clean transparent container (e.g. plastic Cola
bottle), shake vigorously, and expose to sunlight
(e.g. on roof of hut) for 6 h. UV light kills many
bacteria and protozoa, but some viruses resistant;
more effective if water gets hot. Usually only
suitable for small volumes; needs sunlight and
preferably hot climate.
Flocculation/coagulation: Not usually used
domestically. Reduces turbidity, removes 730%
microbes, enhances action of chlorination or
sunlight.
Safe carriage and storage of water: Water is often
contaminated by dirt, dust, animals, or bird
droppings during collection and storage e.g. by
dipping hands or containers into the water store. To
minimize contamination use vessels of sufficient
size, with the smallest possible opening to prevent
hand entry or dipping of utensils, preferably with a
cap or lid, and a spout or tap which prevents hand
contact. Disinfectant such as sodium chlorite may
be added to the water container (as above).

Traveller's diarrhoea
Travellers' diarrhoea affects ~20-50% of the ~12 million travellers to the
tropics/subtropics annually, especially those from high-income
countries; small children and young adults (perhaps because of higher
risk behaviour); backpackers; campers; adventure tourists; and those
staying in low-cost accommodation or cruise ships. In addition to upset
business or holiday plans, longer-term consequences include chronic or
persistent diarrhoea (1-3%), irritable bowel syndrome (3-10%), and
Guillain-Barre syndrome (rare). The most common causes are:
Enterotoxigenic E. coli

30-80%

Salmonella spp

3-15%

Campylobacter jejuni

~20%

Giardia intestinalis

0-3%

Shigella spp

5-15%

Management
(see Fig. 6.10):
Most episodes are self-limiting.
Increase fluid intake. Eating e.g. broth with noodles or salty crackers
with sweetened drinks will provide a balance of carbohydrate and
salt.
Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is preferable if diarrhoea frequent or
severe, or if there are signs of dehydration, weakness, or muscle
cramps, as it more effectively restores both salts and water deficits.
Drinks designed for rehydration during sports activities do NOT
contain the correct balance of salts for diarrhoea treatment. Sodas
and fruit juices are often hyper-osmolar or have high sugar content
and can make diarrhoea worse.
Prompt antibiotic treatment reduces symptom duration (e.g.
ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd PO for 3 days).
Loperamide (4 mg PO once followed by 2 mg after each loose stool)
shortens the episode in older children and adults with frequent small
volume stools. (DO NOT USE loperamide if blood in stools, fever,

tenesmus, or other signs of dysentery.)

Prevention:
Avoid unpeeled fruit and uncooked vegetables, sauces which are not
freshly prepared, and food prepared and handled in unhygienic
conditions e.g. by street vendors. Where there is no reliable source of
chlorinated water, sterilize water by boiling or with chlorine tablets,
or drink bottled water from a reputable source. Avoid bottled water
where the bottles are immersed in water or ice to keep them cool.
Beware of ice or ice cream, which may be made using contaminated
water. When trekking or in isolated places, it is advisable to carry
packets of ORS and a course of treatment. Hand sanitizers are useful
when handwashing is impossible.

Prophylaxis:
Short-term travellers may take prophylactic bismuth subsalicylate (525
mg qds) or antibiotics such as norfloxacillin 400 mg or ciprofloxacin 500
mg daily, but both are associated with some side-effects including a
risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea; early treatment of
episodes is therefore preferable.

Disorders of the mouth and pharynx
Oropharyngeal pathology is a common feature of tropical infections
and is most pronounced in HIV disease and those with malnutrition.

Gingivostomatitis and mouth ulcers
Several viruses may cause gingivostomatitis (inflammation of the
gums/oral mucosa), including HSV, EBV, and enteroviruses (hand, foot,
and mouth disease). If primary HSV gingivostomatitis suspected,
particularly in the setting of HIV, give acyclovir (
p 562).
Aphthous ulcers are common, and may occur in HIV seroconversion.
Oral ulceration also occurs in Behçet's syndrome. Crohn's and coeliac
disease, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Treatment: topical steroid
e.g. adcortyl in orabase, hydrocortisone 2.5 mg lozenges, or inhaled
steroid (e.g. budesonide or beclomethasone) applied directly to the
ulcers; alternatively try tetracycline mouth wash (250 mg in a few ml
of water, held in the mouth for 3 mins) tds for 3 days. Severe aphthous
ulceration in HIV may require oral prednisolone or thalidomide. If
solitary ulcer present for >3 weeks, consider biopsy of ulcer edge to
exclude malignancy.

Oral candidiasis
Small, white mucosal flecks with surrounding erythema, common in
HIV. Treat with nystatin liquid or amphotericin lozenges qds. In HIV
treat with fluconazole 100 mg od for 1 week, especially if oesophageal
candidiasis is suspected (dysphagia/odynophagia).

Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL)
Caused by EBV and associated with advanced HIV disease, OHL appears
as poorly demarcated, slightly raised, and corrugated white patches on
the side of the tongue or buccal mucosa. Unlike candida, it cannot be
scraped off and is painless. OHL does not usually require specific
treatment and usually regresses on ARVs.

Gingivitis
Periodontal disease and caries are a major problem in developing
countries; prevention focuses on encouraging oral better hygiene.
Gingival changes may also occur with anaerobic infection (Vincent's
angina), drugs (phenytoin, cyclosporin, or nifedipine), AML, and
pregnancy. Haemorrhagic gingivitis may occur in vitamin C deficiency
(scurvy). Gingivorrhoea may follow envenoming by certain snake
species.

Glossitis
Glossitis is a feature of iron deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, and
tropical sprue. Overgrowth of papillae and Aspergillus niger result in a
black, hairy tongue.

Pharyngitis
Typically due to Streptococci, viruses, or diphtheria. Less commonly
may occur in Lassa fever or rabies, and rarely, following ingestion of
Fasciola hepatica. In developing countries with high incidence of acute
rheumatic
fever, a single dose benzathine benzylpenicilin 1.2 million units IM

decreases the risk of acute rheumatic fever from 2.8 to 0.2%, and
should be considered in children with sore throat (esp. children >3 yr
old). Necrobacillosis (Lemierre's disease) presents with severe
pharyngitis with spread to neck, thrombosis of internal jugular vein, ±
embolization of infected thrombus; treatment is with IV penicillin +
metronidazole.

Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivostomatitis
Painful ulceration of the mouth with halitosis and gingivorrhoea.
Predisposing factors include malnutrition, HIV, poor oral hygiene, and
smoking. Treat with warm saline mouth washes and metronidazole 200
mg PO tds plus penicillin 500 mg PO qds for 5-7 days.

Other benign lesions of the mouth
Salivary gland hypertrophy is common in malnourished children but
may also be associated with Ascaris lumbricoides infection and as part
of diffuse inflammatory lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS) in HIV. Angular
stomatitis is commonly a feature of iron-deficiency anaemia, HIV, and
riboflavin deficiency.

Malignant lesions of the mouth and pharynx
Buccal squamous cell carcinoma (associated with tobacco, chewing
betel nut, ± alcohol) and Burkitt's lymphoma (due to EBV infection) are
common, especially in India, S.E. Asia, and tropical Africa.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (due to EBV infection) is common in the Far
East and S. China. Malignant change may be preceded by leukoplakia
and epithelial atrophy. Optimum management and outcome rely on
early diagnosis. Consider malignancy in chronic (>3 weeks), solitary
lesions: examine for cervical lymphadenopathy and biopsy lesion ±
lymph nodes. KS causes purple lesions, often on the hard palate. It is
usually associated with HIV; treatment is ART therapy.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Cancrum oris (Noma)
A serious and often fatal condition in which

gangrenous stomatitis rapidly spreads to involve the
palate and face following anaerobic infection. It
occurs mainly in young, malnourished African
children. Management requires wound debridement
and antisepsis, antibiotics (IV penicillin plus
metronidazole), and nutritional rehabilitation (±
surgical reconstruction).

Upper GI tract symptoms
Dysphagia and odynophagia
Dysphagia and odynophagia are difficulty and pain in swallowing,
respectively. Dysphagia that has progressed from solids to liquids
implies severe narrowing of the oesophagus. Endoscopy ± biopsy is the
investigation of choice where available; barium swallow is an
alternative. In HIV, a trial of empirical fluconazole 200 mg OD for 2
weeks for oesophageal candidiasis reduces the need for endoscopy.

Dyspepsia
Epigastric or retrosternal discomfort associated with eating. The
history often provides a clue to the cause (see box). Causes include
peptic ulcer disease, gastro-oesophageal reflux, dysmotility, drugs, and
parasitic infections of the GI tract (including hookworm, Taenia,
Ascaris, Giardia, and Entamoeba histolytica). Suspect malignancy if
age >45 y, weight loss, dysphagia, vomiting, haematemesis, or
anaemia.

Management
1. Review any drugs that may cause dyspepsia.
2. Trial of antacids, unless malignancy suspected.
3. Endoscopy or barium meal if malignancy or peptic ulcer suspected.
4. Stool microscopy if gastrointestinal parasites suspected. Note:

presence of parasites does not exclude other causes of dyspepsia.
5. Stop smoking and avoid alcohol.

Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer
Helicobactor pylori
are motile, Gram-negative rods that live in the mucus layer of the
stomach. In developing countries H. pylori colonization is almost
universal by age 20. Clinical associations include:
Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): Up to 90% patients with duodenal ulcer
and >50% patients with gastric ulcer are colonized with H. pylori.
Gastric cancer: H. pylori causes intestinal metaplasia and atrophic
gastritis which are risk factors for adenocarcinoma of the stomach.
Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma: Generally, a
benign monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes; tumour histology
and clinical features improve with H. pylori eradication.
Non-ulcer dyspepsia: The role of H. pylori in this condition remains
uncertain; trials of H. pylori eradication have shown little benefit.

Diagnosis:
Options include endoscopy + biopsy, serology, urea breath test and
stool antigen test, depending on resources.

Eradication therapy:
Proton pump inhibitor or Bismuth-based regimens with 2 antibiotics,
e.g. oral omeprazole 20 mg od (or bismuth subsalicylate 2 tabs qds) +
amoxycillin 1 g bd (or tetracycline 500 mg bd) + metronidazole 400 mg
bd (or clarithromycin 500 mg bd) for 7 days.

Dysphagia: key questions in the history
Can fluid be drunk normally?
Yes → suspect stricture (benign or malignant)

No → possible motility disorder
Is the dysphagia constant and painful?
Yes → suspect malignant stricture
Is it difficult to initiate swallowing?
Yes → suspect bulbar palsy, especially if swallowing causes cough
Does the neck bulge or gurgle upon swallowing?
Yes → suspect pharyngeal pouch
Is the patient HIV infected?
Yes → suspect oesophageal candidiasis
Are there signs of systemic infection or illness?
Yes → may be manifestation of systemic disease

Causes of dysphagia
Malignancy: carcinoma of the oesophagus, stomach, or pharynx.
Extrinsic compression: mediastinal lymphadenopathy, carcinoma
of the lung, retrosternal goitre, left atrial enlargement.
HIV-associated: candidiasis, CMV, HSV, severe aphthous
ulceration.
Motility disorders: achalasia, Chagas disease, bulbar/pseudobulbar
palsy (incl. bulbar poliomyelitis), diffuse oesophageal spasm,
myasthenia gravis, syringobulbia, systemic sclerosis.
Benign strictures: peptic stricture, ingestion of caustics,
oesophageal web, iron deficiency anaemia (Plummer-Vinson
syndrome).
Pharyngeal pouch.
Others: trauma, foreign body (e.g. bezoar, swallowed fish or
animal bone), anxiety (globus hystericus).

Causes of dyspepsia and their typical clinical features*
Peptic ulcer disease: epigastric pain, night waking, and relief by
eating food, drinking milk, or taking antacids.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux: retrosternal discomfort, heartburn,
and regurgitation/acid brash. Worse lying flat or after large
meals.
Dysmotility: early satiety, bloating, and nausea.
Drugs: e.g. NSAIDs, calcium antagonists, nitrates, pyrazinamide.

Disorders of the oesophagus
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
Heartburn and regurgitation with a bitter, acid taste (acid brash),
particularly when lying flat, are the hallmarks of gastro-oesophageal
reflux.

Diagnosis:
is usually clinical; barium swallow may identify a hiatus hernia.

Management:
stop smoking, lose weight if obese, and raise the head of the bed.
Advise antacids after meals and at bedtime. Severe cases require H2
receptor antagonists (e.g. cimetidine 100 mg at night up to 400 mg
QID) or proton pump inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole 20-40 mg at night) ±
metoclopramide.

Hiatus hernia
Herniation of the stomach through the oesophageal hiatus of the
diaphragm. Often asymptomatic; may predispose to GORD or present
with acute chest and/or epigastric pain. A fluid level behind the heart
on erect CXR, or on Ba meal, is diagnostic. Management is as for
GORD.

Columnar-lined (Barrett's) oesophagus
Columnar-lined oesophagus (CLO) represents the severe end of the

spectrum of GORD in which there is columnar metaplasia of a segment
of the oesophagus. Its importance derives from the risk of progression
to oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

Management:
adequate treatment of GORD is recommended but often difficult to
achieve. Where facilities allow, regular follow-up is advised, with
repeated endoscopy + biopsy to detect malignancy early.

Oesophageal cancer
Oesophageal cancer usually affects adults (males: females ~3:1) aged
>30 years. Incidence is highest in central/east Africa, Iran, southeast
Asia, and northern China. Pre-malignant associations include columnarlined (Barrett's) oesophagus (for adenocarcinoma), and PlummerVinson syndrome and achalasia (linked to squamous cell carcinoma).
Other risk factors include smoking, alcohol, and malnutrition.

Clinical features:
dysphagia, weight loss, retrosternal pain (± lymphadenopathy).
Extensive disease → coughing (due to aspiration or development of
oesophago-tracheal fistula), aspiration pneumonia, Horner's syndrome,
recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (hoarse voice).

Management and prognosis:
usually rapidly progressive; many patients present late so <5% 5-yr
survival. Resection for early stage adenocarcinoma → 5-year survival
of >80% if tumour confined to the mucosa, and 50-80% if submucosa
involved. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy slightly improves survival
in adenocarcinoma. Palliative treatment includes nutrition
(oesophageal stenting often required), pain relief, and treatment of
complications including aspiration pneumonia.

Gastric cancer
The incidence of gastric cancer varies throughout the tropics; it is

especially common in Costa Rica and N.E. Brazil. Risk factors include
chronic gastritis, bile reflux, H. pylori, pernicious anaemia, ingestion
of corrosives, and diet — high salt intake, lack of fresh fruit, and
ingestion of toxic nitrosamines from fish.

Clinical features:
include dyspepsia, weight loss, malaena, anaemia and abdominal
mass. In metastatic disease there may be hepatomegally, deranged
liver function tests, lymphadenopathy (left supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy = Virchow's node), umbilical deposits (Sister Mary
Joseph's nodule), or peritonism.

Diagnosis:
requires biopsy for histology and staging.

Management:
surgical resection offers the only hope of cure. Palliation aims to
relieve pain and obstruction and control haemorrhage.

Upper GI bleeding
Assessment
Haematemesis and/or malaena indicate upper GI bleeding, which may
be due to a number of causes (see box). Initial assessment should
include a brief history and examination to assess the severity and
likely cause. Ask about previous GI bleeds, history of PUD, liver
disease, varices, dysphagia, vomiting or weight loss, comorbidity,
alcohol, and drugs. Look for signs of liver disease and portal
hypotension; do a rectal examination to check for malaena.
Mild to moderate bleed: pulse and BP normal, age <60 y, insignificant
co-morbidity, and Hb >10 g/dl (unless chronic anaemia present).
Severe bleed: age >60 y, pulse >100 bpm, systolic BP <100 mmHg , Hb
<10 g/dl, significant co-morbidity.

Immediate management
IV access (two large bore venous cannulae; central venous access to
guide fluid resuscitation if severe).
Take blood for FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting, group and save/cross-match.
Fluid resuscitate with normal saline or colloid while waiting for
blood (if blood required); in dire emergency, use O Rhesus -ve blood.
Correct clotting abnormalities (vitamin K, FFP, platelets).
Catheterize if severe and monitor urine output to ensure >0.5
ml/kg/h.
Monitor vital signs closely.
Consider urgent endoscopy, and notify surgeons of all serious bleeds
on admission; keep patient nil by mouth until stable.

Further management
Further management depends on severity, response to initial
treatment, and the underlying diagnosis.
High-dose IV proton pump inhibitor therapy reduces re-bleeding (but
has little effect on mortality).
Endoscopy helps define cause of bleeding, assess risk of re-bleeding,
and plan treatment; repeat endoscopy may be required for
rebleeding.
Endoscopic therapy may be possible for some lesions (e.g. adrenaline
injection, sclerotherapy, variceal banding).
If stable 4-6 h post-endoscopy, allow to eat and drink.
Treat peptic ulcer disease with proton pump inhibitors and eradicate
H. pylori. Avoid NSAIDs if possible.
Repeat endoscopy at 6 weeks for gastric ulcers to ensure response to
proton pump inhibitors and exclude gastric cancer.

Oesophageal varices
In portal hypertension, portal-systemic shunts develop in the lower
oesophagus → dilated oesophageal veins. Variceal bleeding occurs in
20-50% cirrhotic patients, usually within 2 years of diagnosis. Mortality
from a first bleed is ~50% and is related to severity of liver disease.
Common causes include liver cirrhosis, schistosomiasis, portal vein
thrombosis, and Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic vein thrombosis).

Management of acute variceal bleed
Assess and resuscitate as for any upper GI bleed (see opposite page).
Protect airway: may require intubation and ventilation if
uncontrolled bleeding, encephalopathy, hypoxia, or aspiration
pneumonia.
Control bleeding by endoscopic variceal band ligation or
sclerotherapy. Balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube
may be used for emergency short-term control of bleeding; ideally,
patient should be intubated and ventilated to reduce risk of
aspiration and to aid passage.
Give octreotide (50 mcg/h IV) for 2-5 days.
Correct clotting abnormalities (FFP ± vitamin K, platelets).
Give antibiotics to reduce risk of bacterial sepsis, e.g. ciprofloxacin
500 mg bd for 1 week.

Primary and secondary prevention of variceal
bleeding
Endoscopic variceal band ligation is most effective if available;
sclerotherapy also works.
Reduce portal pressure with propranolol 40-80 mg bd (and/or
isosorbide mononitrate 20 mg bd).
Manage the underlying cause, especially schistosomiasis — periportal
fibrosis regresses after treatment. Advise to abstain from alcohol.

Causes of upper GI bleeding
Most common causes
Peptic ulcer disease.
Gastritis/gastric erosions.
Mallory-Weiss tear.
Oesophageal varices.
Oesophagitis.
Duodenitis.
Malignancy.
Drugs (NSAIDs, anticoagulants, steroids).

Rarer causes
Portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Angiodysplasia.
Dieulafoy lesion.
Bleeding disorders.
Aortoenteric fistula.
Haemobilia (bleeding from biliary tree).

Acute abdomen
Someone who becomes acutely ill and in whom symptoms and signs are
chiefly related to the abdomen has an acute abdomen. Thorough
history and examination are essential — abdominal pain may be
misinterpreted as body aches and treatment given for malaria, only for
peritonitis to be found later. Prompt laparotomy is sometimes
essential: repeated examination is the key to making the decision.
The most common causes of an acute abdomen are given in Fig. 7.1.

Clinical syndromes that usually require
laparotomy

1. Organ rupture (e.g. spleen, aorta, ectopic pregnancy). There may be
shock and abdominal swelling. Note history of trauma (especially if
pre-existing splenomegaly, but note splenic rupture may occur weeks
after trauma, and in the absence of trauma).
2. Peritonitis (e.g. due to perforated ulcer, diverticulum, appendix,
bowel, or gall bladder). The patient lies still and has signs of shock,
abdominal tenderness, board-like abdominal rigidity, and absent
bowel sounds. Acute pancreatitis may present similarly but does not
require laparotomy, so check serum amylase.

Syndromes for which laparotomy may not be
indicated
1. Local peritonitis
e.g. cholecystitis, salpingitis, appendicitis (the latter will need
surgery). If abscess formation suspected (swelling, swinging fever,
↑WCC) look for sentinel loop on plain AXR; do abdominal USS or CT if
available. Drainage may be percutaneous (USS or CT guided) or by
laparotomy.

2. Colic
is pain which regularly waxes and wanes due to muscular spasm of a
hollow viscus (e.g. gut, ureter, uterus, or gall bladder), causing the
patient to be restless, unlike peritonitis.

3. Bowel obstruction
causes colicky abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, and (often
absolute) constipation, with active ‘tinkling’ bowel sounds (c.f.
reduced bowel sounds in functional ileus). Causes include adhesions
(previous surgery), herniae (internal or external), sigmoid/caecal
volvulus, tumours, intussusception, TB, and ascariasis. AXR showing
dilated loops bowel 9 fluid levels helps to distinguish small and large
bowel obstruction.

Immediate management
Fluid resuscitate with normal saline, colloid, or blood as
appropriate. Anaesthesia compounds shock, so resuscitate properly
before taking to theatre — unless losing blood faster than it can be
replaced (e.g. ruptured ectopic pregnancy, leaking abdominal aortic
aneurysm).
Take bloods for FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca2+, amylase, culture, cross-match.
Insert an NG tube and keep patient nil by mouth; IV maintenance
fluids.
Consider erect CXR, AXR, ± ECG.
Give broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics initially if infection
suspected, and rationalize therapy later in light of investigations
and progress.

Non-surgical causes of an acute abdomen
Several non-surgical conditions may present with an acute abdomen.
The most common causes are listed in the box below.

Medical causes of acute abdominal symptoms
Gastroenteritis.
Typhoid.
Malaria.
Myocardial infarction.
Cholera.
Porphyria.
Heroin addiction.
Pneumonia.
UTI.
Sickle cell crisis.
Polyarteritis nodosa.

Herpes zoster.
Thyroid storm.
Lead colic.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Abdomino-peritoneal TB.
Yersinia enterocolitica.
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome (Chlamydia).
Pneumococcal peritonitis.
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
Irritable bowel syndrome.

Fig. 7.1 Causes of acute abdominal pain.

Appendicitis
Appendicectomy is the most common emergency abdominal operation.
Without surgery, appendicitis may progress to gangrene, perforation,
peritonitis, and death. Mortality is highest at the extremes of age, but
also in young adults in malaria-endemic areas, where non-specific
symptoms may be misinterpreted.

Aetiology
Obstruction due to lymphoid hyperplasia or faecolith; superinfection is
usually bacterial (rarely, amoebae, S. mansoni, S. stercoralis, T.
trichiura, A. lumbricoides, or Taenia spp. implicated).

Clinical features
Increasing central abdominal colic, usually shifting to the right iliac
fossa (RIF) depending on the anatomical position of the appendix.
Anorexia is common; vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Common signs
are flushing with mild fever, tachycardia, RIF tenderness, guarding,
rebound tenderness, and Rosving's sign (LIF palpation causes pain in
RIF). An appendix mass or abscess may be palpable, due to encasement
of the appendix or pus in omentum and bowel loops.

Diagnosis
Clinical. Examine the patient repeatedly, since the severity may
change. Do a PR (painful on right side), and a PV in women to exclude
pelvic disease.

Differential diagnosis
See box. USS may differentiate between an appendix mass and an
abscess.

Management
1. Prompt appendicectomy is indicated to prevent perforation, unless
appendix mass present or surgery otherwise contraindicated. Give
metronidazole 500 mg IV or 1 g PR plus cefuroxime 1.5 g IV prior to
surgery. Surgery is well tolerated during pregnancy, whereas
perforation carries a 30% foetal mortality.
2. If appendix mass present, manage conservatively initially: give
metronidazole 1 g PR tds plus either gentamicin 3-5 mg/kg IV daily
or chloramphenicol 12.5 mg/kg IV q6 h. Monitor vital signs and size
of appendix mass closely. Surgery is indicated if patient's condition

deteriorates. Any abscess should be drained. Elective
appendicectomy is carried out at 73 months, once inflammatory
adhesions have subsided.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Mesenteric adenitis
A viral inflammation of the mesenteric lymph nodes
affecting children. Suspect it if there is high fever,
vomiting, a history of URTI, and cervical
lymphadenopathy. Abdominal signs are usually less
severe than in appendicitis and usually subside
within 48 h.
Differential diagnosis of RIF pain
Inflammation
Mesenteric adenitis
(children)
Meckel's diverticulitis

Caecal diverticulum

Clinical features

High fever, vomiting, cervical nodes; improvement with observation.

Usually discovered at appendicectomy; rarely bleeds or causes obstruction.
May be inflamed, perforate, or bleed; blood PR cannot be attributed to
other causes.

Inflammatory masses

?Abdominal mass, weight loss.

TB

Other systemic signs of TB; ascites common.

Crohn's disease/UC

Systemic, eye, joint, and/or anorectal manifestations.

Worm infection

Worms or ova in stool. Chronic history ± weight loss; pruritis ani.

Amoebic colitis

Diarrhoea with blood and mucus; trophozoites in hot stool; patient may be
critically ill.

Malignancy
Lymphoma

Weight loss; lymphoma elsewhere.

P.281

Caecal cancer

Anaemia, weight loss, intermittent pain.

Large bowel tumour

Diarrhoea; blood PR; eventually obstruction with caecal distension.

Genital tract
pathology
Salpingitis

Ectopic pregnancy

Pelvic abscess
Ovarian torsion or
bleeding

Vaginal discharge; pelvic pain; tender on PV.
Amenorrhoea, vaginal bleeding, abdominal distension; may be shocked;
positive pregnancy test.
Previous salpingitis; ? history of illegal abortion.

Severe pain, minimal signs; requires USS. Ovarian cyst/fibroid.

Testicular torsion

Testis is swollen and very tender ± referred pain.

Intra-abdominal testis

Torsion or malignancy (teratoma/seminoma)

Peritonitis
Peritonitis in the tropics is most commonly due to appendicitis,
perforated duodenal ulcer, tubo-ovarian infection, typhoid perforation,
or amoebic colitis. Consider TB peritonitis if chronic, esp. if HIV
positive.

Clinical features:
The patient is immobile, anxious, and in obvious pain. There may be
fever, sweating, tachycardia, and tachypnoea with use of accessory
breathing muscles. Sepsis results in a hyperdynamic circulation initially
(warm peripheries, bounding pulse), but shock (cold peripheries,
thready pulse) may develop with extravasation of fluid into the
peritoneal cavity. Abdominal findings include distended, rigid abdomen
which moves poorly with respiration; rebound tenderness, guarding,
and absent bowel sounds. In chemical peritonitis (bile, gastric acid, or
pancreatic enzymes) pain is intense; the abdomen may be so rigid that

distension is minimized. Signs of peritonism may be less in the very
young or critically ill (e.g. post-op). Abdominal signs are usually mild in
cirrhotic patients with infected ascites (spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis).

Diagnosis:
is clinical; CXR may show gas under the diaphragm; AXR may show fluid
between thickened loops of bowel or distended bowel and fluid levels.
USS may show intraperitoneal fluid or collections/abscesses. Free fluid
in the abdomen may be aspirated with a fine (21-gauge) needle. Send
the fluid for microscopy (pus cells suggest bacterial peritonitis,
lymphocytes suggest TB) and protein (to confirm fluid is an exudate).
FBC, CRP, U&E, serum amylase, blood cultures are helpful. Diagnostic
laparotomy may be required in severe cases.

Treatment
Immediate management/resuscitation as for acute abdomen (
278).

p

Insert an NG tube and keep patient nil by mouth.
Give broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. IV cefuroxime 750 mg tds or IV
ceftriaxone 1 g od, plus IV metronidazole 500 mg tds).
Monitor vital signs and urine output closely.
Where possible, drain intra-abdominal collections under USS
guidance. If USS not available, or if the patient's condition
deteriorates, drainage by laparotomy is required.
In the absence of contraindications, laparotomy is usually indicated
for severe, generalized peritonitis.

Female genital tract sepsis
Tubo-ovarian sepsis usually causes local pelvic peritonitis. Many cases
may be managed with antibiotics alone — but if patient's condition
deteriorates, pelvic mass expands, or perforated uterus suspected (e.g.
septic abortion), urgent laparotomy ± hysterectomy is indicated.

Rupture of tubo-ovarian abscesses carries a high mortality.

Amoebic colitis
Failure to respond to metronidazole (see
p 222) within 48 h suggests
transmural disease ± ischaemic necrosis for which laparotomy
indicated.

Fig. 7.2 Causes of gas under the diaphragm.

Plain abdominal X-rays (AXR)
These are rarely diagnostic. They are most useful in Gl obstruction.
Gas patterns are best seen on supine images; erect films may
demonstrate fluid levels better. Free intraperitoneal gas (signifying
perforation) is best seen as air under the diaphragm on erect CXRs.

Small bowel is recognized by its central position and valvulae
conniventes, which reach from one wall to the other. Large bowel is
more peripheral and the folds (haustrae) go only part of the way
across the lumen.

Where to look
1. Gas patterns: look for dilated stomach, small intestine, or colon.
Normal diameter of the small intestine is 2.5 cm, colon 5 cm.
Dilated small intestine occurs with obstruction and paralytic ileus.
Dilated large bowel occurs with obstruction, ileus, and toxic
dilatation. Local peritonitis may cause a sentinel loop of
intraluminal gas (localized ileus) giving a clue to the site of
pathology.
You must explain any gas outside the stomach, small intestine,
and colon. It could be a pneumoperitoneum, or gas in the urinary
tract or biliary tree.
2. Biliary tree and urinary tract. The ureters pass near the tips of
the lumbar transverse processes, cross the sacro-itiac joints down
to the ischial spine, and turn medially to join the bladder. Look
for calcification in the gall bladder, kidney, or ureter.
3. Bones: look for scoliosis, degenerative disease, metastatic
deposits (osteolytic or osteoblastic), Paget's disease.
4. Soft tissue: look for position of liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder.

Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is rare in most tropical countries. Single attacks
may occur, or on background of chronic pancreatitis. Progression to
haemorrhagic, necrotizing disease may be very rapid with high
mortality.

Causes:
Gallstones (~50% cases), alcohol abuse (20-25%), other causes of duct
obstruction (e.g. Ascaris, tumour, hydatid cysts in common bile duct),
drugs (e.g. stavudine, sodium stibogluconate and meglumine
antimoniate, thiazides, steroids, tetracycline), viruses (mumps,
coxsackie, EBV, HAV, HBV), hypercalcaemia, hyperlipidaemia, trauma,
scorpion venom, autoimmune diseases (e.g. PAN), hypothermia.

Clinical features:
Abdominal pain and vomiting (90% cases) + ↑ amylase/lipase are
typical. Peritonism may develop, but as the pancreas is
retroperitoneal, abdominal signs are often mild. Jaundice may occur
due to oedema around the common bile duct. Severe disease may
cause peri-umbilical (Cullen's sign) or flank (Grey Turner's sign)
discoloration.

Investigation:
Check serum amylase/lipase (levels peak early and ↓ over 3-4 days),
U&Es, Ca2+, glucose, fasting lipids, ABG. Exclude other causes of acute
abdomen (
p 279). USS for gallstones. If patient deteriorating with
severe pancreatitis, CT may show pancreatic necrosis requiring
surgery.

Prognosis:
assessed using modified Glasgow criteria (see box).

Treatment
Immediate management/resuscitation as for acute abdomen (
278).

p

Severe pain requires strong analgesia (e.g. morphine 10 mg q4 h plus
prochlorperazine 12.5 mg q8 h IM).
Consider broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis ± surgical

necrosectomy in very severe cases (e.g. >30% pancreatic necrosis on
CT).
Following recovery, consider cholecystectomy if gallstones
implicated as cause.

Complications
Early = organ failure: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute
renal failure, DIC, hypocalcaemia (may require albumin replacement
or 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate IV slowly), transient
hyperglycaemia.
Late (>1 week): pancreatic pseudocyst (may resolve spontaneously or
require surgical drainage into bowel; if it becomes infected, it
requires drainage). A few patients develop persisting DM.

Chronic pancreatitis
Destruction of the pancreas with atrophy results in some permanent
loss of exocrine and endocrine function. This may be characterized by
pain, diabetes, and malabsorption with steatorrhoea. 3 main types of
chronic pancreatitis are recognized: chronic obstructive, minimal
change (often post-acute pancreatitis), and chronic calcific
pancreatitis (
see Chapter 6, p 244).

Modified Glasgow prognostic score for acute pancreatitis
The following factors are associated with a poor prognosis. The
greater the number of factors, the poorer the prognosis.
Glucose >10 mmol/l.
Urea >16 mmol/l.
ALT/AST >200 u/l.
LDH >600 iu/l.
pO2 <8 kpa (60 mmHg ).
Albumin <32 g/l.
Calcium <2.0 mmol/l.

Severe acute pancreatitis is suggested by the presence of ≥3 factors.
Outcome is also influenced by the cause of the inflammation.
These criteria have been validated for pancreatitis caused by
gallstones and alcohol (c.f. Ranson's criteria which have only been
validated for alcohol-induced pancreatitis).

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain
RUQ pain is usually due to liver or gallbladder pathology; other causes
include those shown in the box opposite. Important tropical causes
include AIDS cholangiopathy, amoebic liver abscess, hydatid liver
disease.

Gallstones and biliary colic
Impaction of a gallstone in the gallbladder outlet causing severe,
constant pain lasting up to several hours, radiating to the
interscapular region, and associated with nausea and vomiting.
Complications include:
Acute cholecystitis: fever ± local peritonism, tender, palpable
gallbladder especially on inspiration (positive Murphy's sign), and/or
jaundice.
Ascending cholangitis: RUQ pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's
triad).

Management:
Strong analgesia ± antispasmodics (e.g. hyoscine butylbromide 20 mg
IV/IM, repeated after 30 min if necessary). Treat cholecystitis and
cholangitis with broad-spectrum antibiotics e.g. cefuroxime 750 mg IV
tds + metronidazole 500 mg IV (or 1 g PR) tds, followed by
cholecystectomy when the patient's condition allows.

AIDS cholangiopathy
A syndrome of RUQ pain (>90%) and cholestasis ± low-grade fever.

Patients occasionally present with asymptomatic cholestasis.
Cryptosporidium, cytomegalovirus, and microsporidiosis are the most
common causes, but often no organism is identified. 4 types are
recognized: papillary stenosis, sclerosing cholangitis-like, combined
(>50% cases), and extrahepatic duct strictures (include malignancy).
HAART markedly improves prognosis.

Amoebic liver abscess
Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common form of extraintestinal amoebiasis (
p 223). It may complicate acute amoebic
dysentery (~10%) or present months after exposure. ~70% recall no
history of diarrhoea.

Clinical presentation:
Usually acute (over 2-7 days) with fever, rigors, sweats, and RUQ ±
right shoulder tip pain, ± vomiting; left lobe abscesses often → LUQ
pain. May also present subacutely with dull RUQ ache, weight loss,
fatigue, low-grade pyrexia, and anaemia; antimalarial/ antibiotic
treatment may → more subacute presentation. Clinical signs include
hepatomegally (often tender); ‘punch tenderness’ may be elicited if
abscess concealed beneath the ribs. Extreme tenderness or oedema of
the abdominal wall or intercostal space suggests imminent rupture.
There is seldom jaundice or ascites. Right-sided pleural
effusion/empyema/lung collapse may occur due to rupture into the
pleura. Rupture of a left lobe abscess into the pericardium is usually
rapidly fatal.

Diagnosis
Blood tests characteristically show neutrophilia, ↑ESR, ±↑ALT/ALP.
CXR may show raised hemi-diaphragm ± pleural reaction and/or
basal atelectasis.
USS characteristically shows a large (usually unilocular) necrotic
lesion with some internal debris. During the early ‘amoebic
hepatitis’ stage of the disease, USS may miss the lesion: repeat USS

may be required.
E. histolytica serology is +ve in >95% patients after the first week.
Stool microscopy is +ve for cysts in 50% (culture = 75%).
Indications for aspiration are shown in the box. Abscess fluid is
odourless and reddish-brown (resembles ‘anchovy sauce’) rather
than yellow pus. Microscopy shows debris (c.f. pus cells in pyogenic
liver abscess) and Gram stain does not show organisms; rarely E
histolytica trophozoites may be seen.
Beware misdiagnosing acute ALA as acute cholecystitis or
appendicitis.

Management
Drug therapy is sufficient to cause healing without scarring in most
cases. Give metronidazole 800 mg tds (or tinidazole 2 g od) PO for 5
days, followed by diloxanide furoate 500 mg tds (or paromomycin 500
mg tds) PO for 10 days for intraliminal E histolytica eradication.
Indications for percutaneous drainage are given in the box. Drains
may be removed when drainage is minimal (usually after 2-3 days).
Follow up ALA clinically. (Note: USS may show large liver defects
even after successful cure.)

Hydatid disease
Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis are responsible for
causing cystic hydatid disease and alveolar hydatid disease,
respectively.

Cystic hydatid disease
E. granulosus is a small (3-6 mm) cestode (tapeworm) that lives in the
small intestine of dogs (also jackals, foxes). Eggs passed in canine
faeces are infective to humans. Following ingestion, eggs develop into
oncospheres which penetrate the intestinal mucosa and pass in the
blood or lymphatics to host viscera including the liver (50-70%), lungs
(20-30%), other organs, and peritoneal cavity. Oncospheres encyst in
host viscera developing into mature larval cysts. These may be
multiple and reach massive proportions.

Clinical features:
Liver cysts grow ~1 cm a year, presenting as masses rather than
abscesses. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms
related to expansive growth of cysts, including abdominal pain,
hepatomegaly, fever, and jaundice. Lung cysts may present when the
cyst contents rupture into an airway and are coughed up.

Complications:
Cyst rupture may be accompanied by life-threatening anaphylactic
shock; conversely, other cysts collapse or disappear spontaneously.
Cholangitis may occur due to rupture into the biliary tree. Pyogenic
abscesses may form due to bacterial superinfection of cysts.

Diagnosis:
The characteristic appearance of cysts on imaging (USS, CT, or MRI) is
usually sufficient. Serology may aid diagnosis.

Management
Most cysts are amenable to percutaneous aspiration-injectionreaspiration (PAIR) treatment (see box). PAIR cure rates are >95%.
In addition to PAIR, some authorities recommend albendazole 400
mg bd PO for 1-6 months, starting before and continuing after
drainage.
Albendazole treatment alone is not sufficiently reliable, although
some individuals with multiple cysts are treated with prolonged
courses.
Surgical removal may be indicated for cysts not amenable to the
PAIR approach, especially if at risk of rupture or exerting pressure
effects.

Alveolar hydatid disease
Alveolar hydatid disease occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere. E.

multilocularis causes aggressive local tissue invasion by lateral budding
of cysts ± metastasis to other parts of the body (~10% patients to CNS,
lungs, bone, and eyes). Liver complications include cholangitis, BuddChiari syndrome, and portal hypertension. Due to the aggressive
nature of the lesions, many are misdiagnosed clinically/radiologically
as malignnancy. Mortality untreated is high (>60% at 10 yrs). Operable
cases require wide surgical resection to ensure complete resection of
the cyst. Adjuvant albendazole was shown to be of benefit in one case
series. In inoperable cases, albendazole provides arrest or cure in
some patients.

Percutaneous aspiration-injection-reaspiration (PAIR)
Puncture cyst under USS or CT guidance.
Aspirate ~30% of cyst fluid volume.
Inject* an equal volume of a scolicidal agent such as hypertonic
saline (30% saline = 300 g NaCl/litre) or 95% ethanol into the cyst.
Reaspirate cyst contents after 30 minutes.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of hydatid disease
Education and hygiene to avoid exposure
to/ingestion of dog faeces.
In hyperendemic populations, periodic treatment of
dogs (incl. wild and stray dogs) with praziquantel
helps to prevent/control human disease.
Strict control of livestock slaughtering and disposal
of organs helps restrict the access of dogs to
potentially contaminated viscera.

Liver disease
Jaundice
Bilirubin is formed from the breakdown of haemoglobin. It is
conjugated with glucuronic acid by hepatocytes, making it watersoluble. Conjugated bilirubin is secreted into the bile and passes out
into the gut. Some of it is taken up again by the liver (enterohepatic
circulation) and the rest is converted to urobilinogen by gut bacteria.
Urobilinogen is either reabsorbed and excreted by the kidneys, or
converted to stercobilin, which colours faeces brown.

Clinical jaundice (icterus) occurs if plasma bilirubin exceeds ~35
mmol/l. Causes may be pre-hepatic, hepatocellular, or posthepatic/obstructive (see box; for neonatal causes of jaundice, see
p 24). Sclerae and skin appear yellow. Do not confuse normal pale
brown sclerae in dark-skinned people with jaundice. Carotinaemia (due
to eating excess mangoes, tomatoes, or carrots) also causes yellow
skin, especially of the palms and soles, but the sclerae are white.
Pre-hepatic jaundice: excess bilirubin production due to haemolysis,
↓liver uptake, or ↓conjugation leads to ↑ serum unconjugated
bilirubin.
Hepatocellular jaundice: hepatocyte damage ± some cholestasis.
Obstructive (cholestatic) jaundice: bile excretion impeded by intraor extrahepatic biliary obstruction → conjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia; pruritus common (look for excoriations, shiny
fingernails); excretion of water-soluble conjugated bilirubin makes
urine dark; stools pale as less bilirubin excreted in faeces.
Steatorrhoea (fatty, pale, offensive stools that often float) may
occur, and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) may →
osteomalacia and coagulopathy.

Assessment:
Ask about alcohol, blood transfusions, sexual activity, tattoos, body
piercing, jaundiced contacts, family history, and drugs, including
herbal medicines. Examine for hepatomegaly and signs of chronic liver
disease. Further investigations depend on clinical features but include
FBC, clotting, blood film, Coomb's test, U&Es, LFTs, hepatitis viral
serology. Liver USS may show dilatated bile ducts (obstructive
jaundice), gallstones, hepatic metastases, or pancreatic mass.

Hepatomegaly
Hepatomegaly is a common finding in the tropics. Palpate liver, noting
texture, and percuss to define size (normal liver is <12 cm
longitudinally in midclavicular line) — this will differentiate liver
ptosis (e.g. due to lung hyperexpansion in COPD). Auscultate for

hepatic bruit (e.g. in hepatocellular carcinoma). Look for jaundice and
signs of chronic liver disease.

Causes:
include viral (e.g. Hep A-E, EBV, CMV, HIV), bacterial (e.g leptospira,
syphilis, pyogenic liver abscess, TB), protozoal (amoebic liver abscess),
and other parasitic infections (e.g. hydatid, fasciolia, opisthorchis);
chronic liver disease (see box); malignancy (metastases, 1°
hepatocellular CA); infiltrative conditions (amyloid, sarcoid); BuddChiari syndrome; congestive cardiac failure; congenital Riedel's lobe;
and polycystic liver.

Viral hepatitis
Hepatitis A virus (HAV)
HAV is an non-enveloped RNA picornavirus related to enteroviruses.
Transmission is via the faeco-oral route including ingestion of
contaminated food or water. It is the most common viral cause of
hepatitis worldwide and hyperendemic in many parts of the developing
world, especially in areas of poor sanitation, where childhood infection
is very common. Serological studies in hyperendemic areas demostrate
immunity in most adults (e.g. India ~99%), thus HAV is an uncommon
cause of acute hepatitis in adults in these settings. However, infection
frequently occurs in non-immunized travellers and secondary cases or
outbreaks in developed countries may follow importation of HAV.

Clinical features:
Disease severity is proportional to age, ranging from asymptomatic
infection (common in children) to fulminant hepatitis (<0.5%). In
symptomatic cases, after 1-6 week incubation period, there is a
viraemic prodrome including malaise, anorexia, myalgia, headache,
arthralgia, nausea, and fever. Symptoms improve as jaundice appears
— this is often cholestatic and may last up to several weeks in adults.
Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or a rash may occur. Virus is
excreted via the bile in the faeces 1-2 weeks before the onset of
jaundice; excretion then declines over the following week. Chronic
carriage, relapses, and chronic liver disease do not occur.

Diagnosis:
HAV-specific IgM is detectable by symptom onset; HAV-IgG rises 1-2
weeks later and remains elevated for life. ALT/AST rise at the onset
and typically settle in 2-6 weeks. ALP may take longer to settle, along
with the cholestatic jaundice.

Treatment:
is supportive as most infections are self-limiting. Avoid alcohol until
LFTs return to normal.

Prevention:
Improved sanitation reduces transmission. Faecal shedding of the virus
is highest during the incubation and prodromal phase, so by the time of
presentation, isolation of patients is of limited value. Immunity
following infection is probably lifelong. Non-immune travellers to
endemic areas should be vaccinated (see
p 822).

Hepatitis E virus (HEV)
HEV is a non-enveloped, RNA hepevirus endemic in many parts of
south, southeast, and central Asia. Transmission and clinical features
are similar to HAV, although, unlike HAV, large epidemics affecting
mainly young adults have been described. In India, HEV accounts for
>50% sporadic hepatitis in adults. Like HAV, most infections are selflimiting. Women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy are particularly
susceptible to fulminant liver failure and death (~20%) for reasons that
are poorly understood.

Diagnosis:
HEV-specific IgM is detectable at presentation in >90% cases; HEV-IgG
rises thereafter. PCR may detect HEV RNA in blood or stool.

Treatment:
supportive. No vaccine is yet available. Pooled human immune

globulin is not protective.

Hepatitis C (HCV)
HCV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA flavivirus, with 6 major
genotypes and over 50 subtypes. Transmission is predominantly blood
borne, and ~2-5 million iatrogenic HCV infections occur annually. The
prevalence of HCV infection among Egyptians is >15%, mainly due to
mass parenteral anti-schistosomal treatment programmes in the past.
Less commonly, sexual and vertical transmission may occur. The risk of
infection following needlestick injury from a HCV+ve donor is ~1-3%.

Natural history:
Primary infection is usually asymptomatic or accompanied by mild, flulike symptoms; however, 50-85% go on to develop chronic HCV
infection. Non-specific symptoms include malaise, nausea, and
abdominal pain. Ongoing cycles of inflammation, necrosis, and
apoptosis gradually lead to cirrhosis, which occurs in 2-20% over 20-30
years. Progression is faster in males, those infected at an older age,
HIV co-infection (especially if CD4 <200 cells/ml) and/or HBV coinfection, and those with HCV genotype 1. Once cirrhosis present, the
risk of HCC is 1-4% per year. Extrahepatic manifestations, which are
uncommon, include glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis,
and lichen planus.

Diagnosis:
HCV antibodies become detectable 6-8 weeks following 1° infection.
PCR for HCV RNA is expensive and should only be done if treatment is
available, at which point genotyping is also done.

Management:
Conservative measures include avoidance of alcohol as this
accelerates progression of cirrhosis. Specific therapy is costly. Where
available, this is with pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination
therapy for 24 weeks. Genotypes 2 & 3 have been shown to have a

better chance of treatment success (75-85%). Contraindications to
therapy include liver failure, ongoing alcohol or substance abuse,
pregnancy, and co-existing conditions such as uncontrolled seizures or
autoimmune diseases. Response to HCV therapy is less favourable in
HIV/HCV co-infection. HAART improves the course of HCV and is the
mainstay of therapy for co-infected individuals in resource-poor
settings.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
HBV is a double-stranded DNA hepadnavirus. It is an important cause of
acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Worldwide
~2 billion people show serological evidence of exposure and ~400
million have active infection. High prevalence areas include subSaharan Africa, China, and southeast Asia.

Transmission:
The virus is present in the blood and (to a lesser extent) in semen,
vaginal secretions, and saliva of actively infected individuals.
Transmission occurs via transfusion of infected blood products, use of
unsteralized needles, sexually, and among children by close contact
through mucosae or minor breaks in the skin. Vertical transmission
from mother to child occurs perinatally. High-risk groups include health
workers, haemophiliacs, IV drug users, haemodialysis patients, those in
institutions, and homosexual men.

Natural history of acute infection:
Most 1° infections are asymptomatic, esp. in young children.
Symptomatic cases present after an incubation period of 1-4 months
with clinical features indistinguishable from other acute viral
hepatitides. Death from fulminant hepatitis occurs in ~1%;
glomerulonephritis is a rare complication. Following acute infection,
there is either complete recovery (with long-term immunity) or
persistent infection. The latter occurs in 5-10% infected adults, 30%
infected children, and 90% infants infected at birth; it is more common
in the immunocompromised.

Serological markers of infection:
are shown in Fig. 7.4. Following 1° infection, there is marked
viraemia. HBsAg becomes detectable after 4-10 weeks, followed by IgM
anti-HBc. As the host immune response targets infected hepatocytes,
ALT rises, and HBeAg (which is a marker of active viral replication)
becomes detectable. Recovery with viral clearance is accompanied by
disappearance of HBsAg and appearance of anti-HBs and anti-Hbe
antibodies. During the ‘window’ period between disappearance of
HBsAg and appearance of anti-HBs, acute infection can be confirmed
by the presence of anti-HBc.

Persistent infection:
is defined as the presence of circulating hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) >6 months post-infection. There may be:
Asymptomatic chronic HBV carriage (sub-clinical persistent
viraemia, with normal ALT and normal/near normal liver histology);
or
Chronic hepatitis B (liver function and histology abnormal).
Symptoms are usually non-specific and do not correlate with disease
severity. ~20% patients go on to develop cirrhosis, and there is a 100fold increase in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Levels of HBV viraemia are usually lower in persistent infection and
decline over time. Persistent HBeAg indicates higher levels of viral
replication. Clearance of HBeAg may occur with development of antiHBe, may be accompanied by a transient rise in ALT ± clinical hepatitis
(due to immune-mediated destruction of infected hepatocytes) and
usually leads to lower levels of viraemia; a small proportion of
patients (~1% per year) will clear the virus permanently and remain
immune thereafter.

HBe-negative mutants:
Most HBeAg negative patients have low levels of viraemia. However,
some have high viraemia levels despite being HBeAg negative, due to a

viral mutation in the promoter region of the gene encoding the core
antigen which prevents HBeAg expression. Prevalence of these ‘precore mutants’ is higher in certain geographical areas (e.g. Asia 15-20%)
and increases with infection chronicity. They appear to be associated
with more severe disease and higher risk of cirrhosis.

Fig. 7.4 Serological changes in hepatitis B infections. (HBsAg = HBV
surface antigen; HBcAg = HBV core antigen; HBeAg = HBV e
antigen; anti-HBsAg = antibody to HBsAg; anti-HBcAg = antibody to
HBcAg; anti-HBeAg = antibody to HBeAg).

Management of acute HBV infection:
Supportive; avoid alcohol. Management of chronic HBV aims to reduce
transmission risk and limit/prevent progression to cirrhosis and/or
HCC. General measures include avoidance of alcohol (exacerbates
liver damage) and drugs which may promote viral replication (e.g.
steroids, NSAIDs), and adequate nutrition.
Where available, the goal of medical therapy for chronic HBV is to
reduce viraemia and liver damage; complete viral clearance occurs in
<5% cases with current regimens. Most studies have concentrated on
chronic HBeAg-positive carriers with raised ALT, whose course is easy
to follow. Some HBeAg-negative patients with high circulating viraemia
may also benefit from treatment. Treatment options currently
available:
Nucleoside analogues (e.g. lamivudine) interfere with HBV reverse
transcriptase and thereby inhibit viral replication. Lamivudine has
been shown to delay clinical progression in patients with chronic
HBV and cirrhosis, reducing risk of HCC. However, resistance is seen
in >50% patients after 3 years' therapy. The future of HBV treatment
is likely to be combination therapy with other nucleoside analogues
(e.g. adofevir, tenofovir entecavir, emtricitabine, famciclovir).
Interferon alpha showed modest benefit in clinical trials but is
limited by side-effects and has been largely superseded by newer
antivirals.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of hepatitis B infection
Primary immunization

with hepatitis B vaccine is recommended by WHO as
part of the expanded programme on immunization
(EPI) schedule (see Chapter 22). Studies in Taiwan
showed that universal vaccination of children under
5 years reduced the incidence of hepatocellular CA.
Post-exposure immunization
should be given to babies born to mothers who are
HBV carriers or who had HBV during pregnancy, and
to other non-immune individuals exposed to HBV
(e.g. following needlestick injury). Passive
immunization with hyperimmune hepatitis B
immunoglobulin (HBIG)* within 12 h of birth reduces
their chances of developing the carrier state by up to
70%; protective efficacy is increased to 90% by
combining HBIG with HBV vaccine. Give HBIG* plus
HBV vaccine at day 0 and after 1 and 2 months, and
a booster at 12 months (accelerated schedule). It is
unclear whether the combination of HBIG and HBV
vaccination provides significantly better protection
than early (<24 h) HBV vaccination alone, and
practice varies between countries.

Hepatitis D (HDV, ‘delta agent')
HDV is a single-stranded RNA virus that can only replicate in the
presence of HBV, and is transmitted by similar routes. ~5% chronic HBV
carriers are HDV co-infected, especially in the Mediterranean region,
parts of eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South America.
Co-infection leads to more severe acute HBV hepatitis or, in chronic
HBV infection, accelerated hepatic failure and cirrhosis. Treatment
and prevention is as for HBV (HBV vaccination prevents HDV coinfection).

and C infection. (Reprinted from The Lancet, 2006, 368: 896-7, with

Alcohol and drug-induced hepatitis
Alcoholic hepatitis
Clinical features:
Acute hepatitis due to alcohol abuse causes (tender) hepatomegaly and
jaundice ± nausea/vomiting, and the systemic inflammatory response
to liver damage → fever, malaise, anorexia, and leukocytosis.
Depending on the duration and severity of liver damage, signs of
chronic liver disease/cirrhosis may be present.

Investigations:
↑liver transaminases (AST>ALT), ↑bilirubin, ↑ALP, ↑WCC, ↑urea. Alcohol
excess per se may → ↑γGT, ↑MCV, ↓platelets. Reduced hepatic
synthetic function in cirrhosis → ↓albumin, ↑PT.

Management:
Abstinence from alcohol is most important; manage alcohol
withdrawal with reducing course of benzodiazepine (e.g.
chlordiazepoxide). Optimize nutrition and give high-dose B vitamins
(pabrinex) IV. Consider ascitic tap to rule out SBP. If no evidence of
sepsis and severe disease, consider prednisolone 40 mg od for 5 days,
tapered off over the next 2-4 weeks.

Prognosis:
Scoring systems have been devised to predict outcome (see boxes
opposite). Abstinence from alcohol, good nutrition, and steroid therapy

(for severe alcoholic hepatitis) have each shown survival benefit: 7year survival was ~50% in those who continued to drink, compared with
~80% in those who were abstinent.

Drug-induced hepatitis
Drug-associated liver damage is most commonly a result of an
idiosyncratic reaction — one which is infrequent, occurs at therapeutic
doses with variable latency period, and with a pattern that is
consistent for each drug. Injury may result in hepatitis,
cholangiohepatitis, or pure cholestasis (see box opposite). Steatosis,
granuloma formation, and fibrosis may also occur. Women are at
higher risk of drug-induced hepatitis.

Clinical assessment:
Careful drug history including use of traditional and complementary
medicines or over-the-counter drugs, timing of symptoms in relation to
start of drug, and alcohol abuse. Rule out other common causes of
liver injury, such as viral hepatitis.

Manangement:
Once identified, the drug should either be withdrawn altogether, or
very closely monitored for signs of progressive liver damage (e.g.
nevirapine hepatotoxicity on instigating HAART). A decision to rechallenge will depend on severity of the liver reaction and on the
indication for the drug's use. The risks and benefits of reintroducing a
drug should be weighed up. For example, when deciding whether to rechallenge with antituberculous drugs, one should take into account the
strength of the initial TB diagnosis and the duration of antituberculous
therapy already received.

Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis
Chronic liver disease is common in the tropics due to widespread
alcohol consumption and frequent exposure to hepatitis viruses,
parasites, bacteria, and toxins. Persistent liver injury causes cirrhosis:
irreversible destruction of liver cellular architecture by fibrosis, with
nodular regeneration of hepatocytes. Causes are shown in the box
opposite.

Clinical features

Variable and depend upon the degree of liver damage and
compensation. Symptoms include malaise, pruritus, and reversal of
normal sleep patterns (if encephalopathic). Ask about alcohol, blood
transfusions, sexual activity, tattoos, body piercing, jaundiced
contacts, family history, and drugs, including herbal medicines. There
may be hepatomegaly in early cirrhosis, although fibrotic contraction
typically causes the liver to shrink as the disease progresses. Examine
for Dupuytren's contracture (associated with alcohol excess), jaundice,
and extra-hepatic signs of chronic liver disease including portal
hypertension (PHT) and hepatic encephalopathy:
Face and skin: jaundice, hepatic fetor, excoriations.
Hands: leuconychia, clubbing, palmar erythema, bruising, asterixis.
Chest: gynaecomastia, loss of body hair, spider naevi, bruising.
Abdomen: splenomegaly, ascites, testicular atrophy.
Legs: oedema (due to hypoalbuminaemia), muscle wasting.
Hyponatraemia occurs due to 2° hyperaldosteronism, and osteomalacia
may occur due to altered vitamin D metabolism.

Diagnosis
Abnormal LFTs reflect hepatocellular damage (pattern often
dependent on aetiology); ↓albumin and prolonged prothrombin time
reflect reduced liver synthetic function. USS (which shows
characteristic cirrhotic liver architecture) and liver biopsy (check PT,
platelet count, and Hb before biopsy) are the mainstay of diagnosis.

Management and prognosis
Depend on the severity and underlying cause. Cirrhosis is an
irreversible condition, so the aim is to limit further damage, treat
complications, and support the patient.
Avoid alcohol and hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. paracetamol).
Treat dehydration and intercurrent infections.

Viral hepatitis (hep B, C).
Haemochromatosis.
Autoimmune hepatitis.
Cryptogenic.
Primary biliary cirrhosis.
Wilson's disease.
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.
Drugs.

Hereditary haemochromatosis
An inherited disorder of iron metabolism in which intestinal iron
absorption is increased leading to iron deposition in multiple organs
including liver, heart, pancreas, pituitary, adrenals, skin, and joints.
Inheritance is autosomal recessive in the majority of cases.

Clinical features
The classic triad is of hyperpigmentation, hepatomegaly, and diabetes
(30-50%). Fatigue and arthralgia are early symptoms. Cardiac
involvement with heart failure and dysrrhythmias is common, as is

arthropathy; hypogonadism may occur 2° to pituitary involvement
and/or cirrhosis. Presentation is usually in the 4th- 6th decade, due to
slow accumulation of body iron. Men are more frequently and severely
affected, probably due to female menstrual iron loss. Complications
include cirrhosis (9 times more likely in patients drinking >60 g
alcohol/day) and hepatocellular carcinoma, which occurs in 30% of
cirrhotic patients with haemochromatosis.

Diagnosis
↑ferritin, ↑transferrin saturation >80%, ↑serum iron, ↓TIBC. LFTs, blood
glucose, ECG ± echo. Joint X-rays may show chondrocalcinosis. Liver
biopsy to assess severity of liver disease. Where available, genotype
for mutations. Differential diagnosis includes haemosiderosis (see
below) and other causes of 2° iron overload (e.g. thalassaemia and
sideroblastic anaemia); other causes of chronic liver disease (
p
301); and porphyria cutanea tarda.

Management
Venesection is the mainstay of treatment and has been shown to
reduce morbidity and mortality: remove 1 unit blood (~500 ml, 250 g
iron) weekly initially, until mildly iron deficient; then maintenance
venesection of 1 unit every 2-3 months. Aim to maintain serum ferritin
<50 ng/ml and transferrin saturation <50%. Avoid vitamin C
supplementation which accelerates iron mobilization, increasing prooxidant and free-radical activity. Assess and manage end-organ
dysfunction such as cardiomyopathy and diabetes. Screening of all
first-degree relatives is advised: check serum ferritin ± genotyping
where available.

Haemosiderosis (‘Bantu siderosis’)
Haemosiderosis (a focal or general increase in tissue iron stores)
affects the liver in populations in some regions of southern Africa (and
to a lesser extent in some other tropical areas) and is linked to chronic
ingestion of beer brewed in iron containers. Co-factors for chronic
liver disease such as high alcohol intake are also commonly present.

Clinical features:
Hyperpigmentation, hepatomegaly (portal fibrosis/cirrhosis), and
cardiac failure occur. Ascorbic acid deficiency is often present.
Associated osteoporosis may → vertebral collapse.

Management:
similar to hereditary haemochromatosis, with regular venesection. Use
of alternative containers for brewing and storage of beer helps prevent
disease progression/occurrence.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
A chronic granulomatous cholangiohepatitis causing destruction of
inter-lobular bile ducts. The aetiology is thought to be autoimmune.
90% of patients are women. Associations include thyroid and
pancreatic disease, Sjogren's syndrome, and localized cutaneous
scleroderma.

Clinical features:
Vary widely but include fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, clubbing,
xanthomata, xanthelasma, arthralgia, and features of cholestasis (
p 290), cirrhosis (
p 300), and portal hypertension (
p 304).

Diagnosis:
Often diagnosed incidentally following discovery of abnormal LFTs.
↑ALP, ↑γGT, slightly ↑AST/ALT; ↑bilirubin in late disease. Liver USS to
exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Antimitochondrial antibodies
highly specific. Liver biopsy and/or ERCP confirm diagnosis.

Management:
symptomatic: colestyramine for pruritis, low-fat diet, and vitamin
supplementation. Monitor for signs of portal hypertension. Death
commonly occurs within 5 years in severe disease.

Wilson's disease
A rare, autosomal recessive disorder of copper excretion leading to
toxic accumulation of copper in liver and brain (hepatolenticular
degeneration). Clinical features reflect chronic liver disease and basal
ganglia damage (tremor, dysarthria, dyskinesias, parkinsonism, and
eventually dementia). When present, Kayser-Fleisher rings (greenishbrown pigment at the corneoscleral junction) are pathognomonic, but
may only be seen with slit lamp and often absent in young children.

Diagnosis:
↓serum caeruloplasmin levels, ↑24 h urinary copper excretion. Liver
biopsy shows ↑copper (but also raised in chronic cholestasis). MRI may
show typical changes in basal ganglia.

Management:
Lifelong chelation therapy with penicillamine. Screen children and
siblings and treat asymptomatic homozygotes.

Indian childhood cirrhosis
A disease presenting in children aged 1-3 years in the Indian
subcontinent. It may follow a subacute, acute, or fulminant course,
ranging from a viral type acute hepatitis to florid cirrhosis. There is
fibrosis with micro-and macronodular degeneration and, although
progression to hepatocellular CA is rare, mortality is high. The cause is
unknown, although a high copper intake (e.g. from milk stored in
copper vessels), possibly coupled with an inherited defect of copper
absorption/metabolism has been implicated. There is no specific
treatment.

Portal hypertension (PHT)
PHT may be a sequel to any chronic liver disease, although cirrhosis
and schistosomiasis are the most common causes in the tropics. It is
useful to split causes according to the level of obstruction (see box).

Clinical features:
↑portal pressure → splenomegally and ascites; development of portosystemic venous collaterals → oesophageal/gastric varices (the most
serious complication, see
p 277), caput medusae (distended
collateral abdominal veins radiating from the umbilicus), and
haemorrhoids. Look for signs of chronic liver disease.

Management
Treat underlying cause where possible.
Manage and prevent oesophageal variceal bleeds (

p 277).

Prompt treatment of SBP (below) and hepatorenal syndrome (
306).

p

TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting) is an option
where available, but expensive and shunt stenosis is common.

Ascites
Ascites occurs in PHT due to a combination of sodium and water
retention (due to splanchnic arterial vasodilation and ↓splanchnic
arterial pressure → release of vasoconstrictors and antinatriuretic
factors), ↑portal hydrostatic pressure, and ↓plasma oncotic pressure
(↓albumin).

Management:
includes general measures to ameliorate cirrhosis and PHT, and
specific treatment to reduce ascites:
Moderate ascites Give low-dose diuretics (spironolactone 50-200 mg
od or amiloride 5-10 mg od); if response poor or peripheral oedema
present, add furosemide 20-40 mg od for the 1st few days. Aim for
300-500 g weight loss/day (800-1000 g if peripheral oedema).
Massive ascites (rapid accumulation with abdominal discomfort):
Drain ascites with plasma expander cover (e.g. 20% albumin 100 ml

IV per litre drained); remove drain within 24 h to minimize infection
risk. High-dose diuretics are a less effective alternative
(spironolactone 400 mg od plus furosemide 160 mg od). Irrespective
of which method used, diuretics should be used to prevent reaccumulation.
Refractory ascites Repeated ascitic drainage 2-4 weekly; consider
TIPS.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)
Spontaneous infection of ascitic fluid, usually with intestinal pathogens
(e.g. E. coli), which occurs in 10-30% of patients with ascites. There
may be abdominal tenderness or signs of sepsis, but often
asymptomatic/non-specific presentation, therefore consider in any
patient with ascites who deteriorates. Hepatorenal syndrome
complicates in up to 30% episodes.

Diagnosis:
Microscopy and culture of ascitic fluid: SBP defined as ≥ 250
polymorphonuclear cells/mm3.

Treatment:
Broad-spectrum antibiotics e.g. ceftriaxone, pending culture results.
Consider 2° prophylaxis (e.g. norfloxacin 400 mg od) as recurrent
episodes common (70% at 1 year). Albumin (1.5 g/kg initially and 1 g/kg
at 48 h) reduces the incidence of hepatorenal syndrome.

Veno-occlusive disease
Thrombosis of smaller hepatic veins due to toxins such as pyrrolizidine
alkaloids contained in certain herbal teas (e.g. Helotropium,
Crotalaria, and Senecio). It is an important cause of PHT in Jamaica,
South Africa, central Asia, and south west USA.

Causes of portal hypertension
Pre-hepatic

Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (increased portal blood
flow).
Portal vein occlusion (e.g. lymphoma, pancreatic CA).
Portal vein thrombosis (e.g. severe dehydration).
Splenic vein occlusion (following neonatal umbilical sepsis).

Hepatic (sinusoidal)
Cirrhosis.
Schistosomiasis (S. mansoni or S. japonicum).
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Veno-occlusive disease.
Congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Drugs (e.g. dapsone).

Post-hepatic
Congestive cardiac failure (e.g. rheumatic fever, TB pericarditis).
Endomyocardial fibrosis.
Inferior vena cava obstruction.
Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome e.g. in
pregnancy).

Causes of ascites
Portal hypertension (see box above for causes).
Abdomino-peritoneal TB.
Hypoproteinaemia (e.g. nephrotic syndrome).
Right heart failure.
Chylous ascites.

Liver failure
In the tropics, liver failure usually results from viral hepatitis or
alcohol. Less common but significant causes include drug-induced

hepatitis (TB treatment or paracetamol overdose), other infections
(e.g. leptospirosis), and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Onset may be
acute with no preceding illness or jaundice (fulminant hepatic
necrosis). However, liver failure occurs more commonly in patients
with pre-existing cirrhosis. These patients have a chronic deterioration
with infection, lethargy, GI bleeds, diuretic usage, and/or electrolyte
disturbances.

Clinical features
Include jaundice, fetor hepaticus (breath smells like pear drops),
hypoglycaemia, sepsis (which may be overwhelming), ascites ± SBP,
coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
Hepatic encephalopathy: Liver failure leads to build up of ammonia
which enters the brain where astrocytes clear it, producing glutamine
in the process. ↑ osmotic pressure due to excess glutamine causes fluid
to enter cells → cerebral oedema and hepatic encephalopathy. Early
signs include lethargy, asterixis (liver flap), constructional apraxia
(e.g. inability to copy a 5-pointed star), and reversed sleep pattern
with diurnal somnolence, which may progress to confusion, drowsiness,
incontinence, ataxia, ± ophthalmoplegia, extra-pyramidal signs, and
eventually coma.
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) occurs in ~10% patients with advanced
cirrhosis and ascites and is thought to be due to severe intravascular
hypovolaemia causing renal vasoconstriction. Two types are
recognized: type 1 is characterized by progressive oliguria and rapid
rise creatinine, often precipitated by SBP; type 2 is commonly seen in
patients with refractory ascites, who have gradual increase in
creatinine. Prognosis is poor: median survival without treatment is <1
month for type 1. Where available, vasopressin analogues (e.g.
terlipressin 0.5-2 mg bd IV) plus albumin may be effective in up to two
thirds of patients with type 1 HRS.

Management
Monitor vital signs, neuro obs, blood glucose, and urine output
closely.

Treat hypothermia and hypoglycaemia.
Monitor FBC, U&Es, LFTs, and clotting.
Control active bleeding with FFP/platelets; give Vitamin K 10 mg od
IV for 3 days to correct PT (less effective in established cirrhosis).
Insert NG tube (unless oesophageal varices). Consider NG feeding.
Avoid sedatives, hepatotoxic drugs, drugs metabolized by the liver,
and NSAIDs (risk of GI bleed).
Give lactulose (and/or neomycin) to ↓ammonia absorption from GIT.
Manage coma in hepatic encephalopathy (Chapter 10) and monitor
for signs of ↑ICP (consider mannitol).
Ensure careful control of fluid balance.
Investigate and treat suspected infection promptly (e.g. SBP).
Liver transplant, where available, sometimes offers the only hope of
survival or cure.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

P.308

HCC is common, particularly in men aged 20-40 years, and causes an
estimated 1 million deaths per year worldwide. It is the most common
1° cancer of men in sub-Saharan Africa, with a male incidence as high
as 100/100,000 in Mozambique. It is also common in parts of Asia and
the western Pacific.

Aetiology and risk factors
Chronic hepatitis B and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis C are thought
to cause ~80% of HCC cases worldwide.
Aflatoxin B ingestion: the toxin is produced by the plant mould
Aspergillus flavus, which commonly grows on groundnuts (peanuts)
but is also found on maize, millet, peas, and sorghum. Levels of food
contamination in Mozambique are the highest in the world.
Cigarette smoking.

Alcohol: HCC is 5x more common in males who drink >80 g alcohol
per day than in non-drinkers.

Clinical features
RUQ pain, weakness, and weight loss. Hepatomegaly occurs in 90%,
cachexia and ascites in 50%, abdominal venous collaterals in 30%,
jaundice in 25%. A hepatic bruit is audible in half of cases. Bone
metastases may cause pathological fractures and there may be signs
and sequelae of portal hypertension (e.g. bleeding from oesophageal
varices).

Diagnosis
Clinical. CXR may show a raised R hemidiaphragm. ALP and Afetoprotein usually ↑. Other Ix: USS, CT scan, biopsy.

Management
HCC is a rapidly growing tumour and treatment is usually palliative. In
the tropics, presentation may be fulminant, with death occurring
within weeks of diagnosis. Aim to relieve pain and reduce symptoms
(e.g. antipruritic agents, drain ascites, transfusions for anaemia).
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and transplantation are disappointing.
Surgical resection provides the only prospect for cure, although this is
only possible in ~2% of cases at presentation.

Prevention:
HBV vaccination and avoidance of risk factors (above).

Hepatic neoplasia
Liver metastases are less common in the tropics than in the developed
world. Clinical features may relate to the underlying primary cancer or
may be non-specific (e.g. malaise, lethargy, weight loss). The liver may
have a characteristic knobbly feel on palpation. Jaundice is relatively
uncommon as a presenting feature. Investigations: USS and biopsy are
the best means of determining the cause of focal liver lesions.

Differential diagnosis of the irregular liver
Cystic lesions:
amoebic (or pyogenic) abscess — both usually very tender in a
febrile, toxic patient; congenital liver cysts, polycystic liver, or
hydatid cyst — all non-tender, no fever unless secondarily infected.

Solid lesions:
are likely to be malignant. Surgical resection of small, solitary
lesions may be attempted. If the patient is terminally ill, omit all
investigations and concentrate on palliation.

Primary cancers which cause liver metastases
Male
Stomach.
Lung.
Colon.
Uterus.

Female
Breast.
Colon.
Stomach.
Carcinoid.

Rarer malignancies
Pancreas.
Leukaemia.
Lymphoma.

Liver flukes
Liver trematodes (or flukes) are an important cause of human disease
and prevalence rates may exceed 50% in some endemic areas. All are

transmitted by food contaminated with infective metacercariae.

Opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis
Approx. 17 million people are infected by the 3 closely related species
of human liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis (E. Asia), Opisthorchis felineus
(E. Europe, N. Asia), O. viverrini (Thailand, Laos), and O.
guayaquilensis (Ecuador). In N.E. Thailand, where the prevalence of O.
viverrini infection reaches up to 25%, it is believed to contribute to the
high incidence of cholangiocarcinoma.

Life cycle and transmission:
Humans are infected following ingestion of raw or undercooked fish
containing metacercariae (see Fig. 7.6). Adults can live in the biliary
tree for years. Pathology results from bile duct inflammation caused by
large numbers of adult flukes.

Clinical features:
Asymptomatic hepatomegaly is common, although USS may reveal
gallbladder enlargement, sludge, gallstones, and poor function. RUQ
pain, anorexia, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, and fullness are common
symptoms; fever, eosinophilia, obstructive jaundice, weight loss,
ascites, and oedema occur in more severe cases. Some patients have a
sensation of something moving within the liver.

Complications:
Gallstones and intrahepatic stones are common complications. Risk of
cholangiocarcinoma due to O. viverrini infection is related to worm
burden (5-fold increased risk for mild infection, 15-fold for heavy
infection). Acute opisthorchiasis (O. felineus) presents with fever,
tender hepatomegaly ± splenomegaly, and eosinophilia (up to 40% of
WCC) soon after exposure to a large dose of metacercariae.

Diagnosis:
is usually by detection of eggs in stool (may not be present in complete

biliary obstruction or low worm burden). Adult worms may also be
identified by ERCP or during surgery. Percutaneous bile aspiration is
not recommended due to the high risk of biliary peritonitis and
haemorrhage. Serology (± stool antigen detection assays) are available
in some endemic areas.

Management:
Praziquantel 40 mg/kg PO stat is often effective. Heavy Clonorchis
infection may require up to 75 mg/kg tds for 2 days.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of clonorchiasis/opisthorchiasis
Improved sanitation and prohibition of the use of
night soil in fishponds.
Cook freshwater fish thoroughly; discourage
consumption of raw fish.
Saturated salt solution recommended for fish
storage (but unproven).
In non-endemic areas, suspect import of dried or
pickled fish.
Molluscicidal control of snail vectors is not feasible.

Fig. 7.6 Life cycle of Opisthorchis or Clonorchis: (A) the adult
flukes living in the biliary tree of the carnivorous host (e.g. man or
palm civet) shed ova into the bowel. Sewage contaminates fish
ponds in which freshwater snails (B) live. In the snails, the
parasites develop into miracidia, redia, and then cercariae which
infect freshwater fish (C). The carnivore completes the cycle when
ingesting metacercariae in the flesh of uncooked fish. (Adapted
from G. Piekarski, Medical parasitology in plates, 1962, with kind
permission of Bayer Pharmaceuticals.)

sinensis — black; O. viverrini — dark grey; C. sinensis and O.
viverrini — light grey).

Fascioliasis
Fascioliasis is primarily an infection of animals, with man as an
‘accidental’ host. Nevertheless >2 million people worldwide are
estimated to be infected with Fasciola hepatica or F. gigantica. Adult
flukes live in the biliary tree of the primary hosts (usually sheep for F.
hepatica and cattle for F. gigantica), passing eggs which are excreted
in faeces. In water, ciliated miracidia hatch and infect an intermediate
snail host. Free-living cercariae leave the snail, attaching to aquatic
plants such as watercress where they become metacercaria. Following
ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and migrate
through the small intestinal wall into the liver and peritoneum. Larvae
migrate to the common and hepatic ducts maturing into adult flukes.

Clinical features
Although many infections are asymptomatic, the pre-patent larval
stage lasting 3-4 months may be accompanied by abdominal pain,
weight loss, fever, and eosinophilia. During chronic or biliary stage
fascioliasis, a small number of the adult flukes live in the bile ducts
and shed eggs into the faeces. Patients are frequently asymptomatic,
but may have symptoms and signs of biliary pain or obstruction.

Diagnosis
Eggs can be seen in the faeces within 2-4 months of infection, but
identification may require repeated samples. Serology is useful for
diagnosis, but cross-reaction has been reported with other worms.
There may be an eosinophilia, and USS ± further imaging may be
useful. Dietary history is important, particularly in outbreaks and in
returning travellers.

Management
Single-dose triclabendazole 10-20 mg/kg PO is the treatment of choice,
with low incidence of side-effects. The 2nd line drug is bithionol which
requires 10-15 days' treatment and causes side-effects in up to 50%.
Praziquantel is NOT active against F. hepatica.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of fascioliasis
Avoid eating raw watercress/other aquatic plants,
especially from grazing areas.
Exclude animals from commercial watercress beds.
Avoid the use of livestock faeces to fertilize water
plants.
If practicable, treat livestock.
Consider molluscicides to eliminate mollusks (not
considered feasible in most settings).

Fig. 7.8 Life cycle of Fasciola hepatica. The mammalian hosts (A),
usually cattle, sheep, or man, become infected when ingesting
aquatic plants (e.g. watercress) or grasses at the edges of fresh
water. The ingested metacercariae excyst to form young flukes
which migrate through the wall of the intestine and through the
capsule of the liver and liver parenchyma until they reach a large
bile duct. There the adult fluke (B), which is 2-4 cm long, lives for
many years, passing its large (140 m) operculated eggs via the bile
duct into the faeces. The eggs hatch in fresh water and undergo
development in pond snails (C) into cercariae. These attach
themselves to aquatic plants (D) which are ingested to complete
the life cycle. (Adapted from G. Piekarski, Medical Parasitology in
Plates, 1962, with kind permission of Bayer Pharmaceuticals.)

Schistosomiasis (Bilharzia)
A common, chronically debilitating, and potentially lethal disease
affecting ~200 million people worldwide (with ~600 million people at
risk), second only to malaria in socio-economic importance. It is
caused by infection with the blood trematodes (flukes) Schistosoma
mansoni, S. japonicum, S. haematobium, and, occasionally, S. mekongi

or S. intercalatum. In most cases, infections are light or moderate. It is
usually a slow, insidious disease but may give rise to renal failure,
colitis, periportal fibrosis, and bladder carcinoma.

Life cycle and disease burden
Transmission occurs when humans are exposed to water infested with
the intermediate snail host while swimming, washing, or collecting
water (Fig. 7.10). Schistosome cercariae released from the snails
penetrate human skin and enter blood vessels, passing via the lungs to
the liver, where they mature into adults. Adult worms may migrate to
vesical plexus (S. haematobium) or mesenteric veins (other species).
The adults mate and may produce eggs for several years. Some of the
eggs pass into the urinary tract (S. haematobium) or into the bowel
(other species) before being excreted in urine or faeces. Other eggs
lodge in the bladder or bowel mucosa, or are carried in the blood to
ectopic sites (e.g. lungs, liver, CNS). Disease is caused the granulomas
around the eggs.
Adult worms do not multiply, so the level of infection and disease is
proportional to the degree of exposure. Usually, there is a slow
accumulation of egg granulomas; clinical illness occurs after several
years. Infection peaks in early adult life with both sexes equally
affected. Infections may be very severe in those with regular exposure
e.g fishermen on African rivers/lakes, rice farmers in Philippines.
Prevalence and intensity of infection decrease in older age groups due
to less water contact and acquired immunity.

Clinical features — Acute infection
Early reaction (swimmers' itch) occurs hours after infection. It is a
pruritic papular rash with oedema, erythema, and eosinophilia
caused by reaction to cercariae upon skin penetration. It resolves
spontaneously within 10 days and is rare in people living in endemic
areas.
Katayama fever (acute toxaemic schistosomiasis) is a rare, but often
severe, immune complex mediated seroconversion illness which
occurs 1-3 months after 1° infection. It is most severe with S.

japonicum and S. mansoni. Clinical features include fever, rash,
chills, sweating, anorexia, headache, diarrhoea, cough,
hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and giant urticaria. There is
usually marked eosinophilia and raised immunoglobulins, and serial
serology shows rising titres of anti-schistosomal antibodies. Usually
no ova, or only scanty ova, are found in specimens as egg output is
only beginning at this stage. It only occurs in non-immunes on first
exposure to schistosomiasis (e.g. travellers from non-endemic
areas), and usually subsides after several weeks (although egg output
may remain high).

Fig. 7.10 Life cycle of schistosomiasis. The adult worms live in
venous plexuses in the pelvis; the male wraps around the female
and encloses it in its gynaecophoral canal. The human host (A)
sheds ova in stool or urine; these hatch, releasing miracidia which
infect the freshwater snail host (B). After further development,
cercariae are released into the water, which penetrate the skin of
humans during water contact. (Adapted from G. Piekarski, Medical
Parasitology in Plates, 1962, with kind permission of Bayer
Pharmaceuticals.)

Disease Control and Prevention, 2005, with permission from
Elsevier.)

Clinical features — Chronic disease
In chronic disease, eggs induce granulomatous inflammation and
fibrosis which may affect many organs:
Hepato-splenic disease (hepatic periportal fibrosis): may cause
hepatosplenomegaly (often massive) and portal hypertension with
porto-systemic collateral circulation, ascites, and
oesophageal/gastric varices. Liver enzymes and albumin are usually
normal, with few stigmata of liver failure until very late stages.
Hypersplenism may result in pancytopaenia. The USS appearance is
characteristic. Even if other causes of liver cirrhosis may co-exist, it
is wise to treat for schistosomiasis because even established
periportal fibrosis may improve substantially with treatment.
Intestinal disease: eggs may reach both the superior and inferior
mesenteric venous plexuses (and superior haemorrhoidal veins in S.
japonicum disease) and pass through to the intestinal mucosa to
involve both small and large bowel. Chronic inflammation of the
large bowel may cause intermittent, bloody diarrhoea with
tenesmus, pseudopolyp formation, hypoalbuminaemia, and anaemia,
giving a clinical picture similar to that of ulcerative colitis or
proctitis. A ‘bilharzioma’ is a mass of schistosomal eggs, which may
be found in the omentum and/or mesenteric lymph nodes. Other
features include protein-losing enteropathy, intussusception, and
rectal prolapse.
Genitourinary disease: chronic sequelae of S. haematobium infection
include bladder fibrosis and calcification with reduced volume, and
blockage of vesicoureteric orifice resulting in ureteric obstruction,
hydroureter, hydronephrosis, reflux, and secondary infection.
Patients may present with terminal haematuria or haemospermia.
There is an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder
at a relatively young age. Other pelvic structures, including fallopian
tubes, may be affected.
CNS disease: is a rare but serious complication of ectopic egg
deposition. Eggs of S. japonicum may embolize to the brain to cause
meningoencephalitis or focal epilepsy. S. mansoni or S.

haematobium eggs occasionally embolize to the spinal cord, causing
cauda equina syndrome, a transverse myelitis-like syndrome,
paraplegia, or bladder dysfunction.
Pulmonary disease: embolizing eggs (esp. S haematobium)
occasionally occlude the pulmonary capillary bed, leading to
pulmonary hypertension. There may be fatigue, syncope, chest pain,
and signs of RV failure (raised JVP, tricuspid incompetence,
peripheral oedema).
Other sites: very rarely, there may be placental, genital,
arthropathic, or cutaneous schistosomiasis.
Bacterial superinfection: bacteria (e.g. Salmonella spp) may colonize
adult worms, providing a source for bacteraemic episodes.

Diagnosis
Rests upon a history of exposure and clinical signs ± demonstration of
eggs in the urine (S. haematobium) or faeces/rectal biopsy specimen
(other species) or serology. Urine dipstick for blood is a sensitive
screening method for urinary schistosomiasis. Filtration or
sedimentation of urine prior to microscopy increases yield. Thick
faecal smears (Kato-Katz preparation) are examined under relatively
low power. Collected eggs may be hatched in fresh water to
demonstrate miracidia. Depending on the presentation and site of
infection, other methods include liver biopsy and further radiological
imaging.

Management
Permanent cure is achievable in non-endemic areas but not usually
feasible in endemic areas due to the high rate of re-infection. In cases
where treatment does not achieve a full cure, egg production is
nevertheless decreased by > 90%.

Katayama fever:
Drugs are poorly active against the early migratory phase parasites
(schistosomules). Give oral prednisolone to suppress the acute

reaction, then praziquantel 40 mg/kg PO as a single dose. Repeat
praziquantel after ~1 month.

Chronic disease
Praziquantel is the drug of choice. It is effective against all
schistosome species (plus cestodes and other snail-borne
trematodes). For most species, give 2 doses of 20 mg/kg PO 4-6 h
apart (3 doses 4 h apart for S. japonicum). If possible, take after
food. S. mekongi may require repeated doses. For CNS disease, give
75 mg/kg as 3 divided doses 4 h apart. Paediatric dosage is the same.
Cure rate is ~70%.
Oxamniquine is an alternative for S. mansoni only. It is
contraindicated in pregnancy; drug resistance is reported; and
availability is limited.
Metrifonate is an alternative for S. haematobium only. 3 doses are
required, 2 weeks apart. Drug availability is limited.
Surgical treatment is not recommended — even chronic/fibrotic lesions
will improve, especially in the young, and CNS disease may show
resolution even after treatment.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Control of schistosomiasis
Education and improved sanitation.
Mass treatment of high-risk groups in high endemic
areas (school-aged children, women of childbearing
age, certain occupational groups).
Personal protection e.g. rubber boots for rice
farmers.
Avoid recreational swimming in at-risk areas.
Rapid, vigorous drying following contact may kill
any cercariae which have not fully penetrated skin.
Molluscicides (costly and have environmental

consequences).

Ascariasis
Ascaris lumbricoides
is a soil-transmitted roundworm accounting for ~60,000 deaths
annually. ~25% of the world's population are infected, with prevalence
approaching 95% in parts of the tropics.

Life cycle
Eggs containing larvae are ingested and hatch in the small intestine.
Larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate via the bloodstream
through liver and heart to the lungs, where they penetrate alveoli and
ascend the tracheobronchial tree to be swallowed. Returning to the
intestine they develop into mature worms, beginning egg production ~2
months after initial ingestion. Adult worms live ~10-24 months and
female worms lay ~200,000 eggs/day. Eggs passed in faeces persist in
warm humid soil for up to 6 years and are resistant to cold and normal
detergents. Children in rural areas have the highest burden of
infection, as do communities which use human faeces as fertilizer.

Clinical features
Most infections are asymptomatic. Heavy infection produces symptoms
proportional to worm burden, especially in children:
Larval migration: 1-7 days after infection, larvae may invoke a
hypersensitivity response with cough, wheeze, eosinophilia, and
patchy infiltrates on CXR (Löffler's syndrome). Ectopic migration to
the CNS occasionally causes convulsions, meningism, and insomnia.
Ocular granulomas, similar to those of Toxocara canis, may occur.
Adult worms: mild infections usually asymptomatic, but may cause
appetite suppression, abdominal discomfort, and dyspepsia. Heavier
infections (particularly in children) may cause anaemia and
malabsorption of vitamins A & C, proteins, fats, lactose, and iodine.

Growth retardation and cognitive impairment are frequently seen.
A bolus of adult worms may cause bowel obstruction (usually near
the ileocaecal valve), intussusception, volvulus, or perforation,
which may be fatal. One study in Nigeria reported intestinal
obstruction in 1:1000 infected children.
Individual worms may enter the common bile duct, pancreatic duct,
or appendix, leading to obstructive symptoms and 2° bacterial
infections.
Eggs released into the peritoneum may cause granulomas and
chronic peritonitis resembling TB peritonitis.
High fever or exposure to anaesthetics can cause adult worms to
migrate (e.g. to stomach). Worms are often vomited up by febrile
patients; rarely they migrate to ectopic sites (e.g. Eustachian tubes).

Diagnosis
Marked eosinophilia occurs during larval migration; differential
diagnosis of this stage includes toxocariasis, hookworm,
strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, and TPE. Intestinal infection is
diagnosed by identifying worms or eggs in faeces (colour plate 5).
Worms may be seen on AXR or Ba studies as string-like or tramline
shadows.

Management
Albendazole 400 mg PO stat (½ dose if <3 yrs) kills adult worms.
Alternatives in adults/children >1 y: mebendazole 500 mg PO stat or
100 mg bd for 3 days; or pyrantel pamoate 11 mg/kg PO stat (max 1
g).
Treat Loeffler's syndrome with prednisolone, followed by
albendazole 2-3 weeks later to kill adult worms.
Intestinal or biliary obstruction is best managed conservatively
(analgesia, NG tube, antispasmodics, IV fluids, liquid paraffin)
followed by antihelminthic treatment once the acute phase is over.
Laparotomy may be necessary for worsening/persistent obstruction,

appendicitis, or intestinal perforation. Sometimes the bolus of
worms can be ‘milked’ into the colon by the surgeon.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of ascariasis
Education:
improve hygiene and protect food from dirt.
Sanitation:
prevent soil contamination by faeces disposal (e.g.
latrines).
Mass treatment:
is indicated when prevalence of infection >50% or
frequency of heavy infection (>50,000 eggs/g
faeces) ≥10% in pre-school children. Give singledose albendazole or mebendazole to women
(annually) and pre-school children (2-3 × per year).

Fig. 7.12 Life cycle of A. lumbricoides. Vegetable gardens are
faecally contaminated by eggs, which become embryonated
(infectious) after 1-7 weeks in the soil. The ingested eggs hatch in
the intestine, larvae migrate through lungs (see text), then are
swallowed to become adult worms (females up to 40 cm, males

smaller). (Adapted from G. Piekarski, Medical parasitology in
plates, 1962, with kind permission of Bayer Pharmaceuticals.)

Toxocariasis
The canine and feline roundworms Toxocara canis and T. catis have a
worldwide distribution. Humans are an accidental host: adult worms
do not develop in humans, yet larvae migrate around the body and
may persist for >10 years, causing visceral larva migrans and ocular
disease.

Life cycle
Eggs excreted in dog or cat faeces (particularly from puppies) become
embryonated in the soil and are later ingested by humans. Larvae
hatch in the stomach, penetrate the intestinal mucosa and enter the
circulation via mesenteric blood vessels, from where they may migrate
to the brain, eye, and other organs.

Clinical features
Depend upon the density of infection:
Visceral larva migrans, which occurs predominantly in children <5
years old, is characterized by heavy infection. Although
asymptomatic infection may occur, typically there is fever,
hepatomegaly ± splenomegaly, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia. CNS
involvement (with seizures, encephalopathy, and/or
neuropsychiatric symptoms), myocarditis, and nephritis are
described. In most cases, the disease resolves spontaneously within 2
years, although it can be fatal, particularly if there is CNS
involvement.
Ocular toxocariasis usually manifests in slightly older children (5-10
years) and is an important cause of decreased visual acuity in the
tropics. It usually presents with unilateral visual impairment.
Peripheral involvement of the retina by subretinal granulomata and

choroiditis closely resembles retinoblastoma in the early stages.
Diffuse endophthalmitis or papillitis and secondary glaucoma can
occur.
Co-infection with Ascaris and Trichuris may also occur. 2° infection
with gut bacteria carried by the larvae is common.

Diagnosis
Clinical suspicion; history of exposure, particularly to puppies;
eosinophilia, fever ± organ involvement, hypergammaglobulinaemia,
and elevated isohaemogglutinin titre.
ELISA using recombinant antigens to 2nd stage larvae has ~92%
specificity and reasonable sensitivity (~78% for titre 1:32). CXR may
show mottling in lung disease. Demonstration of larvae is very
difficult, though they are sometimes present at the centre of
granulomatous lesions at biopsy or post mortem.

Management
Albendazole 400 mg PO bd for 5 days; alternatively, thiabendazole 50
mg/kg PO daily in 3 divided doses for 7-28 days; or diethylcarbamazine
3 mg/kg PO bd for 21 days. Steroids may be required for ocular disease.

Public health note
Prevention of toxocariasis
Educate pet owners; avoid contamination of soil by
dog and cat faeces in areas immediately adjacent
to houses and child play areas.
Control stray dogs and cats.
Regular deworming of cats and dogs beginning at 3
weeks of age.

Lower GI bleeding
Lower GI bleeding occurs less frequently than upper GI bleeding and
presents with passage of red blood per rectum. (Rarely, very brisk
upper GI bleeds may result in passage of red blood PR rather than
malaena.)

Causes:
In the absence of diarrhoea, the most frequent cause is haemorrhoids.
Other causes include lower GI malignancy, diverticular disease,
angiodysplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, typhoid fever, and
amoebic or bacterial dysentery (
see Chapter 6). Other causes in

the setting of HIV/AIDS include TB, disseminated fungal infection (e.g.
histoplasmosis), and intestinal KS.

Diagnosis and immediate management
1. Resuscitate as for upper GI haemorrhage (

p 276).

2. Detailed history and examination, including rectal examination.
Stool colour gives an indication of the level of pathology in the GI
tract (in general, the darker the stool, the higher the cause). Be
alert for symptoms and signs of typhoid fever and constitutional
symptoms of TB.
3. Proctoscopy and rigid sigmoidoscopy ± biopsy where appropriate.

Further management:
depends on the cause. In many cases, bleeding will cease
spontaneously with bed rest. Prolonged bleeding will necessitate
further investigation (e.g. colonoscopy). Consider keeping patient nil
by mouth (give IV fluids) initially or if there is a risk surgery may be
required. For large bleeds, involve a surgical team at an early stage.

Diverticular disease
A diverticulum is an out-pouching of the gut wall which may be
congenital, but is more commonly acquired due to raised intra-luminal
pressure (e.g. 2° to straining at stool due to constipation) which forces
the mucosa to herniate through the muscular layers of the gut wall.
The condition is less common in many parts of the tropics, probably
due to a diet high in fibre. Patients typically present with altered
bowel habit, LIF colic (relieved by defecation), and painless rectal
bleeding. Diverticula may become infected (diverticulitis), causing
fever, leukocytosis, raised ESR. Treat with bed rest, high-fibre diet,
and (if infected) antibiotics. Monitor for signs of perforation (>40%
mortality).

Colorectal carcinoma

Lower GI malignancy remains relatively uncommon in the tropics. Risk
factors include a high-fat, low-fibre diet; prolonged colonic transit
time; polyposis coli; and ulcerative colitis. Tumours may be annular,
polypoid, or ulcerous. Clinical features include altered bowel habit,
blood/mucus PR, tenesmus, and non-specific features of malignancy
(weight loss, lethargy, anorexia, etc). Anaemia and/or faecal occult
blood may suggest lower GI bleeding. Abdominal or rectal examination
may reveal a palpable mass. Late presentation may be with bowel
obstruction or perforation. Perform lower GI endoscopy + biopsy where
available (proctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy, depending on the
site). The Duke's classification is used for tumour staging. With
complete surgical resection, the prognosis of Duke's A carcinoma is
good.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are rare in the tropics,
although cases are reported from more developed areas. The usual
presentation is with weight loss and diarrhoea with blood and mucus.
Severe disease may present with intestinal obstruction or toxic
dilatation of the colon. Anorectal fissures/fistulae and oral or perineal
ulceration may also complicate Crohn's disease. Associated extraintestinal manifestations include erythema nodosum, pyoderma
gangrenosum, anterior uveitis, arthritis, sacroileitis, primary
sclerosing cholangitis, renal stones, malnutrition, and amyloidosis.
Diagnosis requires sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy and biopsy. Management
of the acute case is with systemic steroids (or topical prednisolone
enemas if disease is localized to the rectum). Exclude infective
aetiology (e.g. amoebic dysentery) as best as possible first. 5-ASA drugs
such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine form the backbone of
maintenance therapy. Severe cases may require surgery.

Haemorrhoids (piles)
Haemorrhoids are prolapsing anal cushions, normally associated with
constipation and/or childbirth; varicosities of the anal canal may also
occur in severe portal hypertension. Presentation is with bright red PR
bleeding, prolapse, and/or discomfort (pain may be severe if

thrombosis occurs). They are classified and treated as follows:
First degree: prolapse down the anal canal but not out of it;
therefore only recognized at proctoscopy. Treatment is
sclerotherapy by injecting 2 ml of 5% phenol in oil.
Second degree: prolapse through the anus but reduce spontaneously.
Treatment is with sclerotherapy or rubber band ligation.
Third degree: as above but require digital reduction.
Fourth degree: remain permanently prolapsed. Treatment is with
rubber band ligation or haemorrhoidectomy.
Thrombosed piles are treated with analgesia and bed rest. The clot
may be expressed under local anaesthetic, usually relieving the
pain.

Prevention:
high-fibre diet; avoid straining during defecation.

As for adults

Around the anus
Pruritus ani
Peri-anal itching/discomfort may be caused by:
Skin infection or damage e.g. due to enterobiasis, tinea cruris,
psoriasis, contact dermatitis, lichen planus, lichen sclerosis,
leukoplakia, Corynebacterium minutissimum (the causative agent of
erythrasma).
Surgical conditions e.g. haemorrhoids, fissure-in-ano, fistulae, skintags, polyps, malignancy.

Enterobiasis (threadworm, pinworm)
The soil-transmitted helminth Enterobius vermicularis is a common
infection of young children worldwide.

Life cycle:
Transmission is usually faeco-oral (pruritus ani → scratching → eggs
transferred on fingers or under fingernails from anus to mouth; eggs
may also be carried on contaminated bed linen or fomites) or by

retroinfection in which larvae hatching at the anus migrate back
upwards into the bowel. Ingested ova hatch in the stomach and larvae
migrate to the appendix and caecum where they invade the crypts and
mature into adult worms (9-12 mm long by 2-4 mm wide). The female
migrates through the anus (usually at night) and lays eggs on the
perianal skin and perineum, which are then carried on the faeces or
picked up under the fingernails during scratching. There is no
multiplication inside the body. The cycle takes about 2-4 weeks.

Clinical features:
In the majority of cases, infected individuals are asymptomatic until
the female deposits her eggs perianally. This induces intense pruritus.
General symptoms include insomnia, restlessness, loss of appetite and
weight; children are often irritable and frequently have enuresis.
Worms can enter the vulva and cause vulvitis with a mucoid discharge
and pruritus. Worms may also occasionally be found in the ears and
nose. Very rarely, the worms gain access to the abdominal cavity and
cause chronic peritonitis and granulomata. 2° bacterial infection of
skin damaged by scratching is a common problem.

Diagnosis:
Requires detection of eggs on swabs from either the perianal region
(use sellotape), under the fingernails, or (less commonly) in the faeces.
Occasionally, adult worms may be seen around the anus (usually with
an ‘element of surprise’ at night!).

Management:
Really only beneficial in symptomatic individuals since reinfection is
virtually inevitable in most cases, unless there is change in behaviour.
Where possible, treat the whole family and school members. A single
dose of albendazole 400 mg PO (children 12-24 months 200 mg) or
mebendazole 100 mg repeated after 2-3 weeks.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of recurrent threadworm infection

Education to improve personal hygiene.
Scrub children's hands before meals and after
defecation.
Keep fingernails short.
Wash bedclothes, underwear, and nightclothes
regularly at ≥55°C for several days after
treatment.

Fig. 7.14 Life cycle of threadworm (Enterobius vermicularis). Eggs
are ingested (e.g. from fingers which have scratched itchy

perianal skin). Larvae hatch in the intestine, develop, and
penetrate the mucosa. The male and female worms mate in the
intestine and the smaller males die; the gravid females (about 12
mm long) migrate through the anus and deposit up to 10,000 eggs
on the perianal skin. (Adapted from G. Piekarski, Medical
parasitology in plates, 1962, with kind permission of Bayer
Pharmaceuticals.)

Visible ‘worms’ in stool
Some helmith infections may present following direct observation of
worms in the stool. These include Ascaris lumbricoides (
p 318),
Taenia saginata and Taenia solium (the beef and pork tapeworms), and
Hymenolepsis nana (the dwarf tapeworm).

Taenia saginata (the beef tapeworm)
This is common wherever raw beef is eaten (e.g. Ethiopia). Mature
proglottids of the bovine tapeworm Taenia saginata are highly motile
and conspicuous in the faeces of infected individuals. Occasionally,
proglottids (white, 16 × 8 mm, flat, motile) may be felt emerging
independently from the anus, causing embarassment. The adult worm
is typically 3-5 m long (though some reach 10 m) and attaches, via
suckers, to the upper small intestine wall. Humans are the only
definitive host and usually acquire infection from eating raw or
undercooked beef containing a larva-filled cysticercus. Adult worms
may shed up to 50,000 eggs per day for 10 years or more. Patients may
complain of vague abdominal pain, distension, anorexia, and nausea,
although infection is often asymptomatic.

Diagnosis:
Eosinophilia is not usually a feature. Eggs may be seen on faecal
microscopy but are often absent because they are contained within
proglottids — if the stool is negative, ask the patient to collect
proglottids to show you. Intact proglottids can be speciated according

to the number of uterine branches.

Management:
Give praziquantel 10 mg/kg PO as a single dose.

Prevention:
Avoid eating undercooked beef (cysts are destroyed by temperatures
>48°C). Improve sanitation. Avoid cattle grazing in areas used for
open-field defecation.

Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm)
Cysts are eaten in poorly cooked pork (the intermediate host) and
mature in the small intestine. The adult worm measures 2-3 m (up to 8
m) and attaches to the mucosal surface by two encircling rows of
hooklets. Unlike T. saginata, humans are also readily infected by the
larval form of the tapeworm after ingesting eggs excreted by a human
carrier (often auto-infection from faecal-oral contamination), causing
human cysticercosis (see
p 440). Symptoms of adult worm infection
are as for T. saginata. The proglottids are smaller (~12×6 mm) and less
motile.

Management:
Give praziquantel 10 mg/kg PO as a single dose.

Hymenolepsis nana (the dwarf tapeworm)
Measuring 3-4 cm, H. nana is seldom seen in the stool but may give rise
to abdominal symptoms like other tapeworms. However, unlike the
other tapeworms, H. nana has both larval and adult stages in humans
and does not require intermediate hosts. Infection with several
hundred worms is common. Since encystation occurs within small
intestinal villi, there is immune stimulation, resulting in eosinophilia.
Characteristic eggs are seen on faecal microscopy.

Management:
Give praziquantel 20 mg/kg PO as a single dose.

Fig. 7.15 Life cycle of T. saginata. Man ingests the cysticercus in
beef, which evaginates, and the scolex attaches to wall of the
intestine. The adult worm grows to several metres length in the
intestine, releasing gravid segments (proglottids) and some free
eggs. Cattle become infected when grazing on grass contaminated
with faeces. (Adapted from G. Piekarski, Medical parasitology in
plates, 1962, with kind permission of Bayer Pharmaceuticals.)

Cardiology in developing countries
The pattern of cardiovascular disease is changing in developing
countries. Although infectious diseases still dominate clinical medicine
in many countries (especially in Africa), increasing urbanization with
its attendant risk factors of smoking, hypertension, and obesity are
producing a new pattern of disease which includes stroke, diabetes
mellitus, and ischaemic heart disease. While ischaemic heart disease is
increasing in Latin America, India, and China, the disease is still rare
in rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa, India, and South America.
Rheumatic heart disease, tuberculous pericarditis, and infectious
(Chagas' disease) and other cardiomyopathies remain major
contributors to circulatory disease in many developing countries.
Acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease still disable young
patients and are the most common causes of heart failure in children
and young adults. Facilities for medical and surgical treatment are
often lacking. HIV co-infection has led to a large increase in cases of
tuberculous pericarditis, carrying a mortality of 40% in HIV+ patients.
The cardiomyopathies are endemic in many developing countries.
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is highly prevalent in parts of Africa;
endomyocardial fibrosis occurs in the peri-equatorial tropical regions
of Africa, America, and India.

Chagas' disease is the major cause of disability secondary to tropical
diseases in young adults in Latin American countries. Congestive heart
failure caused by Chagas' cardiomyopathy is the most frequent and
severe clinical manifestation of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and is
associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality when compared
to heart failure due to other causes.

Chest pain
Central chest pain
Nature
A constricting pain suggests angina, oesophagitis, or anxiety.
A sharp pain may be from the pleura or pericardium (both may be
exacerbated by deep inspiration, movements or positions, postures).
Prolonged, crushing, tight (‘like an elephant on my chest’), intense
pain unrelated to position or breathing suggests myocardial
infarction (MI).
The pain of aortic dissection is often felt in the back.
Pains that are unlikely to be cardiac in origin include:
Short, sharp, stabbing or pricking pains.
Pains lasting <30 seconds, however intense.
Well-localized left submammary pain (‘in my heart, doctor’).
Pains of continually varying location.

Ask about
Radiation (to shoulders, neck, jaw, or arms — especially left:
suggests lesion of the heart, aorta or oesophagus).
Precipitating and exacerbating factors (exercise, emotion, or
palpitations suggest ischaemia; food, lying flat, hot drinks, or
alcohol suggest oesophagitis. However, a meal may also precipitate

angina).
Alleviating factors (N.B. glyceryl trinitrate relieves both cardiac pain
and oesophageal pain, but acts much more rapidly in the former).
Pericardial pain classically improves on leaning forward.
Associations (e.g. dyspnoea and/or palpitations, pallor, sweating,
feeling of impending doom, nausea and vomiting — can be present
with both an inferior MI and GI pathology).
Risk factors for ischaemic heart disease (age >55 years, previous
angina/MI, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia).

Non-central chest pain
May still be cardiac in origin, but other conditions enter the
differential diagnosis (see box). The more common conditions include:
Pleuritic pain.
Musculoskeletal pain.
Gall bladder disease.
Varicella zoster (shingles).
Pancreatitic disease.

Angina
Classically, this is central, crushing chest pain that may radiate to the
jaw, neck, or one or both arms. It may be felt only in the jaw or arm,
or be felt as tightness across the chest. It represents myocardial
ischaemia and may be precipitated by exertion, anxiety, cold, or a
heavy meal and be associated with dyspnoea, pallor, and faintness. It
is relieved by rest and nitrates. In most cases, it is caused by coronary
artery disease, but may be due to valvular heart disease (aortic
stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis), hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, and hypoperfusion from dysrrhythmias, arteritis, or
anaemia. Indigestion is the most common differential diagnosis.
Ischaemic heart disease is particularly common in people of Asian,
Melanesian, Polynesian origin (who also have high incidence of NIDDM).

The incidence is also higher in black than in white Americans. Angina is
graded clinically using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
grading system—see box.

Diagnosis
On the ECG look for ST depression, flattened (or inverted) T waves,
and evidence of old infarcts (Q waves). If available, do an exercise
ECG 48 h after the angina settles. Take blood for FBC and ESR to
exclude nonatheromatous causes (see above), and cardiac enzymes, as
available, to exclude myocardial infarction.

Management
Risk factor modification:
Stop smoking, prudent diet (↓ lipids and ↑ fruit and vegetable intake),
↓ weight, exercise more. Look for hypertension, diabetes, and
hyperlipidaemia and treat as appropriate. Start:
Aspirin: 75-150 mg od.

Anti-anginal therapy:
Start with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) 300 to 600 mcg either sublingually
or as a spray at 0.4 mg per dose prn up to every hour. If inadequate,
switch to triple therapy:
1. Beta-blockers: e.g. atenolol 50-100 mg PO od. (contra-indicated in
asthma).
2. Slow-release calcium antagonists: e.g. nifedipine MR 30 mg-90 mg PO
od; felodipine 5-10 mg/day, diltiazem 60 mg PO 2-3 times od,
increasing to max 360 mg od. (contra-indicated in fertile women).
Short-acting Ca2+ blockers ↑ cardiac events.
3. Isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate (as available): mononitrate 10-60
mg/d (od or bd); dinitrate 10-60 mg tds. NB: need nitrate-free
interval of 7 h in every 24. When drugs fail to control angina (CCS
Class II to IV, see box), coronary angiography is indicated to consider

revascularization either by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
or by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for the relief of
symptom.

Unstable angina
Unstable angina
is new onset angina of at least CCS III severity (see box), or angina that
is rapidly worsening and present on minimal exertion or at rest or
within 30 days of MI.

Management:
aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and bed rest. Give unfractionated
heparin 7500-10,000 IU IV q4 h to keep APTT twice control, if
monitoring is available. (If available, low molecular weight heparin
does not require monitoring.) If pain persists or recurs or high TIMI risk
score ≥5 (see below) refer for specialist
assessment/angiography/revascularization.

Grading of angina pectoris by the Canadian
Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
Class
I

Angina occurs only with strenuous, rapid, or prolonged exertion.

Class
II

Slight limitation of ordinary activity: angina occurs on walking or climbing stairs
rapidly, walking uphill, walking or stair climbing after meals, or in cold, or in
wind, or under emotional stress, or only during the few hours after awakening.

Class
III

Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity: angina occurs on walking 1 or 2
blocks on the level and climbing one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at a
normal pace.

Class
IV

Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort — anginal symptoms
may be present at rest.

Preventing ischaemic heart disease (IHD)
The prevention of IHD applies to three groups:
1. Cardiovascular health promotion in children and adolescents —
promote healthy diet, no smoking, and high physical activity.
2. 1° prevention of adults without overt features of cardiovascular
disease.
3. 2° prevention in adults with established cardiovascular disease (i.e.
MI, peripheral vascular disease, or stroke).

Interventions
Diet: advocate consumption of a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole
grains, dairy products, fish, legumes, poultry, and lean meat. Fat
intake is unrestricted prior to 2 years of age. After age 2, limit foods
high in saturated fats (<10% of calories per day), cholesterol (<300

mg per day), and trans-fatty acids. Limit salt intake to <6 g per day.
Smoking: avoid beginning cigarette smoking and exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke, and complete cessation for those
who smoke.
Physical activity: >60 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous physical
activity, and sedentary time must be limited (e.g. limit TV time to
<2 h/day).
The following 1° prevention interventions are of proven cost
effectiveness in adults who do not have overt cardiovascular disease:
Prudent diet, smoking cessation, and physical activity.
Identification and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and familial
hyperlipidaemia.
Statins in patients with diabetes and hypertension with multiple risk
factors.
The following 2° prevention interventions are of proven value and cost
effectiveness in adults with overt cardiovascular disease:
Prudent diet, smoking cessation, and physical activity.
Statins in patients with IHD, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for all patients with MI,
PVD, stroke.
Cardiac rehabilitation following MI.

Myocardial infarction (MI)

P.336

This is the irreversible necrosis of part of the heart muscle, almost
always due to coronary artery atherosclerosis.

Clinical features:
the pain is usually of greater severity and duration (>30 minutes) than
angina, though similar in nature and usually associated with nausea
and vomiting, sweating, pallor, and distress. In the elderly and

diabetics, small MIs may be painless. There may be tachycardia,
tachypnoea, cyanosis, mild pyrexia (<38.5°C). The BP may be ↑,
normal, or ↓. There may also be features of the complications (e.g.
dyspnoea, basal lung crepitations, pericardial rub, or the pan-systolic
murmur of mitral incompetence or VSD).

Diagnosis:
ECG and cardiac enzymes. Diagnosis is based on (i) history (ii) ECG
changes, and (iii) cardiac enzymes in order to allow the classification
into ST-elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI).
Troponins, where available, are the investigations of choice.

Other tests:
CXR — look for features of heart failure, change in cardiac size
(ventricular aneurysm), or aortic dissection. Measure haemoglobin,
white cell count, and platelet count; urea, creatinine, sodium,
potassium, and glucose.

ECG changes in MI
An initially normal ECG progresses to tall T waves and ST elevation (>2
mm in two chest or >1 mm in two adjacent limb leads for a diagnosis
of STEMI). Alternatively, patient may develop new onset LBBB. Within
24 h, the T wave inverts as ST elevation begins to resolve. Pathological
Q waves (>1 small square in width and >2 mm in length) form within a
few days. These may persist or completely resolve in 10%. T-wave
inversion may or may not persist. If ST elevation persists, suspect
ventricular aneurysm.

Site of infarct
Anterior: changes occur in V2-5.
Septal: changes in V1-3.
Inferior: changes in II, III, and aVF.
Lateral: changes in I, aVL, and V6.

Posterior: look for the reciprocal (i.e. inverted) changes in the
anterior leads V1-3; dominant R wave (= inverted Q wave); and ST
depression (= inverted ST elevation) with the clinical features of an
infarct. May be associated RV infarct — ask for V4R ECG lead (lead
V4 placed in mirror image position over right chest) which will show
ST elevation.
Non-Q-wave infarcts: (formerly called ‘subendocardial infarcts’) do not
involve the whole thickness of the myocardium and thus have the ST
changes but not the Q waves.

Fig. 8.1 ECG changes following MI.

Fig. 8.2 Release patterns of cardiac markers (Wu, A.H., Journal of
Clinical Immunoassay 1994, 17, 45-8.)

Immediate management of MI
The greatest risk of death is in the 1st hour — prompt action can and
does save lives.
Relax and reassure the patient.
Give oxygen by face mask if hypoxic or left heart failure/pulmonary
oedema suspected. Finger pulse oximetry is then recommended to
monitor arterial O2 saturation.
Insert an IV line and give pain relief (morphine 10 mg by slow IV
injection, followed by further 5-10 mg doses as necessary; half the
dose in elderly or frail patients.)
Give GTN 0.3-0.6 mg sublingual tablet or spray.
Give aspirin 300 mg PO stat, then 75 mg od thereafter.

Give clopidogrel, initially 300 mg, then 75 mg PO daily on admission,
in conjunction with aspirin.
If STEMI, refer to a centre where streptokinase (see box opposite) or
1° percutaneous coronary intervention may be given within 12 h.
Give a beta-blocker (e.g. atenolol 5 mg IV over 5 min, 50 mg PO 15
mins later, then 50 mg bd) unless the patient has heart failure or
asthma. It will ↓ cardiac O2 demand, infarct size, and risk of
dysrrhythmias and septal rupture.
Start the patient on an oral ACE inhibitor 24 h after the infarction.
Titrate dose against BP.
Start statin therapy in hospital in all patients regardless of initial
cholesterol level.
Tight glycaemic control with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes
is required in the peri-infarction period.
Prohibit smoking.
At least 24 h bed rest with continuous ECG monitoring and q6 h
temp, pulse, RR, BP. Perform frequent clinical examination for
complications (
p 339).
Daily ECG, cardiac enzymes, U&Es (and CXR if there is worsening
lung function) for the subsequent 2-3 days.

Post-infarct management
If the post-MI period is uncomplicated, the patient may be mobilized
by day 2 or 3. If there are no complications, the patient can usually be
discharged by day 3 and gradually ↑the amount of exercise done over 1
month. The patient should not drive during this period. Strongly
discourage smoking and give dietary advice.

Prognosis:
depends upon the degree of LV dysfunction, presence of significant
dysrrhythmias, heart size on CXR, presence of post-MI angina, and the
presence of pulmonary oedema. In the UK, mortality rates for the first

year after discharge are 6-8% with over half these deaths occurring in
the first 3 months.

Long-term treatment:
patients with no complications and good prognostic indices should be
discharged and followed by the general practitioner. All patients should
be advised to modify their risk factors.
All patients should ideally take aspirin (indefinitely), clopidogrel (for at
least 9-12 months), beta blocker (for >18 months), an ACE inhibitor
(indefinitely), and a statin (indefinitely).

Thrombolysis
Streptokinase is the most widely available thrombolytic agent. Give
1.5 million units streptokinase in 100 ml 0.9% saline IV over 1 h.
Carries ~1% risk of stroke. Other side effects include hypotension
(usu responds to slowing down or stopping infusion), nausea,
vomiting, haemorrhage, anaphylaxis (rare). tPA, rPA, and tNK are
more expensive thrombolytics than streptokinase, but slightly more
effective and cause less hypotension.

Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy
A thrombolytic agent should not be given if the patient:
Has had a stroke or active bleeding (e.g. peptic ulcer) within the
last 2 months
Has systolic BP>200 mmHg
Has had surgery or trauma in the past 10 days
Has a bleeding disorder or uses anticoagulants
Is pregnant
Is menstruating
Has had previous streptokinase treatment between 4 days and 1
year previously (in the case of streptokinase).

Complications of MI
1. Post-infarct angina:
(within 30 days of MI): is associated with ↑imortality and occurs in up
to 30%. Treat vigorously with nitrates, beta-blockers, Ca2+ channel
blockers, heparin, and aspirin. Angiography is indicated.

2. Arrhythmias:
see ALS protocols below.
Sinus bradycardia — may be due to infarct or medication (betablocker). Usually no action is required if the patient is
haemodynamically stable.
Supraventricular tachycardia — a sinus tachycardia is common postMI. Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in 10% and should be rapidly
controlled to avoid the onset of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and
infarct spread. Use beta blockade. AF is usually transient, but, if
necessary (in presence of heart failure or hypotension, or refractory
to other treatments), conversion back to sinus rhythm can be
achieved by DC cardioversion or IV amiodarone (see
p 344).
Ventricular arrhythmias are most common in the first few hours
post-MI and may be heralded by ventricular premature beats.
VT>120 bpm may progress to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Treat with
an IV beta-blocker. Correct low serum potassium level. Amiodarone
(300 mg IV over 20-60 min; then 900 mg over 24 h) may be added if
VT recurs. VF may occur in the first few hours or days and needs
emergency treatment. It carries a poor prognosis in the presence of
cardiogenic shock or failure. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm can
occur after any MI with reperfusion (following thrombolysis) — it is
usually benign, not affecting cardiac output, and needs no
treatment.
Nodal rhythms: have a narrow QRS complex, normal axis usually, but
have no associated P wave (or it may come after the QRS). They are
usually intermittent and self-limiting, but in a large MI may ↓ both

cardiac output and BP. Treat with atropine or a temporary
pacemaker.
Conduction disturbances: all degrees of AV block may occur, most
commonly in inferior MIs (20%). 1st-degree block needs no
treatment. 2nd-degree block is usually Wenckebach and only
requires treatment if there is symptomatic bradycardia. 3rd-degree
block often follows second-degree block and is usually temporary.
Again, treat with atropine or isoprenaline if symptomatic. In
extensive anterior MIs, damage to the conducting system will cause
complete and progressive AV block that will require pacing, possibly
permanently. Heart block in inferior MIs is usually temporary, lasting
<5 days.

3. Myocardial dysfunction
Left ventricular failure (see below).
Cardiogenic shock: severe failure causing hypotension, tachycardia,
oliguria, distress, and peripheral shutdown. It may be due to: acute
MR, severe LV dysfunction, cardiac rupture, VSD, arrhythmias, RV
infarct. Treatment is with face mask O2, IV diuretics (if LVF), fluids
(if RV infarct), inotropes. Evidence from clinical trials supports
invasive intervention in cardiogenic shock post-MI.

4. Right ventricular infarct:
occurs in one-third of inferior infarcts but is clinically significant in
less. There is ↓BP and ↑JVP with clear lung fields on auscultation. Lead
V4R (see
p 336) on the ECG may show ST elevation. Treatment is
with IV fluids to ↑LV filling. Inotropes may be useful.

5. Mechanical defects
Papillary or septal rupture occurs in <1% of all MIs and may occur 1-7
days after an anterior or inferior MI (MR most commonly after
infero-lateral MIs, VSD after septal MIs). Listen for new murmurs and
basal crepitations, and watch for clinical deterioration. Urgent

surgery is indicated for papillary muscle rupture with acute MR;
early closure of VSD is advised.
Left ventricular aneurysm: occurs in 10-20% of anterior MIs. The apex
beat is diffuse and there may be atypical/stabbing chest pain,
accompanied by ST elevation lasting 4-8 weeks. They rarely rupture
but are associated with emboli, arrhythmias, and CCF. Patients may
require lifelong anticoagulation. Surgical removal of aneurysm is
indicated in intractable heart failure, recurrent ventricular
tachycardia, and frequent embolism in spite of anticoagulation.
Cardiac rupture: usually results in rapid death 2-7 days post-MI. It
occurs in <1% of MIs. A small or incomplete rupture may be sealed by
the pericardium, forming a pseudoaneurysm that needs prompt
surgical repair.

6. Pericarditis:
20% of patients have a pericardial rub after 24 h. There is chest pain,
relieved by sitting up and varying with respiration. It is usually selflimiting but a single-dose NSAID (e.g. indomethacin 100 mg PR) may be
very effective, avoiding the need for long-term therapy.
Dressler's syndrome: is an autoimmune pericarditis occurring 1-10
weeks post-MI in 5% of patients. There is fever, leucocytosis, and,
occasionally, pericardial or pleural effusion. Treatment is with
NSAIDs ± corticosteroids.

7. Mural thrombus:
is common in large MIs and may cause arterial emboli, leading to
strokes, gut/limb/renal infarcts. Usually diagnosed by
echocardiography; needs warfarin for ≥3 months.

Advanced life support (ALS) protocols

P.342

Most sudden deaths result from dysrrhythmias associated with acute MI
or chronic IHD. Successful resuscitation following a cardiopulmonary
arrest is most likely if:

The arrest is witnessed.
Basic life support is started promptly and
Defibrillation (if appropriate) is carried out as early as possible.

Basic life support (BLS)
The purpose of BLS is to maintain adequate ventilation and circulation
until a means can be obtained to reverse the underlying cause of the
cardiac arrest.
Remember A, B, and C — Airway, Breathing, and Circulation.
Ensure that it is safe to approach the patient.

Airway:
Remove foreign bodies from the airway (including false teeth); use
suction if necessary. Tilt the head back (unless a neck injury is
suspected) or do jaw thrust.

Breathing:
Is the patient breathing? If not, assist via a mask (with 100% O2) and
bag ventilation if available, or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until
intubation is possible. If there is upper airway obstruction, a
cricothyrotomy may be needed. If there is a tension pneumothorax,
relieve it before proceeding further.

Circulation:
Is there a pulse in the carotid arteries? If not, begin external cardiac
massage until defibrillation (under the guidelines below) is possible.
If you are alone and the patient is unconscious, assess whether
going/calling for help would be of more benefit than attempting
resuscitation alone. It is hard to leave an injured/unconscious person,
but their only realistic hope of survival may be if you go straight for
help.

ALS treatment algorithms for cardiopulmonary
arrest
The algorithm shown opposite is a summary of the methods used in the
ALS training scheme. The methods involve skilled procedures which
should only be attempted by qualified staff, since improper use of
defibrillators could result in more harm being done to the patient, as
well as harm to those carrying out the resuscitation. It is strongly
recommended that all medical staff read the ALS (or equivalent)
course book and practise arrest protocols in ‘mock’ arrest scenarios.
Note: If at any stage a spontaneous pulse is felt, defibrillation should
stop and the patient be ventilated. Watch for peri-arrest dysrrhythmias
(see below). Intubation and IV access should take <30 seconds. If
difficult, they should be delayed until the next loop of the cycle. If
defibrillation remains unsuccessful, consider changing the paddle
positions or the defibrillator.
ALS protocols are presented with the kind permission of the
Resuscitation Council (UK) Ltd., and are also given on the inside back
cover of the book for easy reference in emergency.

permission of Resuscitation council (UK) Ltd).

Cardiac dysrrhythmias
These most commonly occur in the setting of an acute MI, but may also
occur during chronic ischaemia.

Clinical features:
are usually of ‘funny turns’, collapse, and palpitations. Distinguish
from epilepsy — a witness may help in this.

Investigations:
FBC, U&E, Ca2+, glucose, TFTs, CXR, ECG. Arrange echocardiography if
cardiomyopathy or valvular disease is suspected.

Atrial fibrillation (AF)
AF is an ineffective, irregular atrial tachycardia, which results in
irregular ventricular contraction. Common causes are MI, ischaemia,
MV disease, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, and excess alcohol intake.
Also: cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, sick sinus syndrome, CA bronchus,
endocarditis, atrial myxoma, and haemochromatosis. It is a significant
risk factor for stroke.

Clinical features:
an irregularly irregular pulse with a first heart sound of varying
intensity and the apex rate greater than the radial rate. The patient
may be breathless and complain of palpitations. ECG shows a chaotic
baseline with no P waves and irregularly irregular QRS complexes.

Therapeutic strategy

The therapeutic goals in patients with AF are:
To identify and treat the underlying cause or risk factor for AF.
A choice of restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm
control) versus acceptance of the arrhythmia and control of
ventricular rate (rate control).
Assessment of thrombo-embolic risk and antithrombotic treatment
for patients at risk. Anticoagulation with warfarin is superior to
antiplatelet therapy.

Identification of the underlying cause
This is the first step in the management of all patients with AF. The
underlying cause (listed above), if any, must be addressed prior to or
at the same time as initiating specific treatment for AF.

Rhythm control
Using electrical cardioversion, drugs, ablation, or surgery may be
particularly useful in younger patients with structurally normal hearts
and paroxysmal AF, or persistent AF of recent onset. Both electrical
and chemical cardioversion carry risk of embolization of atrial
thrombus, so should only be attempted within 48 h of new AF onset, or
in patient adequately anticoagulated for >6 wks, or if precardioversion transoesophageal echo shows no thrombus.

Rate control
Appropriate in elderly patients with hypertension or structural heart
disease and persistent or permanent arrhythmia, especially if this
can be tolerated symptomatically.
Use drugs (usually β or calcium channel blockers with or without
digoxin) or, occasionally, atrioventricular node ablation and
implantation of a permanent pacemaker.

Antithrombotic treatment

Anticoagulation with warfarin is indicated in patients with AF
(paroxysmal or persistent) with:
Previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack.
Valvular or other structural heart disease.
Hypertension.
Diabetes.
Age >65years.
Left ventricular dysfunction and/or left atrial enlargement on echo.
Warfarin carries a risk of bleeding which should be balanced against
its likely benefits and discussed with the patient in each case.

Bradycardia
If the bradycardia is acute and symptomatic (usually post-MI):
Treat or remove the underlying cause (e.g. beta-blockers, NB eye
drops).
Give atropine 0.3-0.6 mg slowly IV, repeating to a max. of 3 mg in 24
h.
Alternatively, try isoprenaline 1-4 mcg/min IV (increasing to 8
mcg/min if necessary for Stokes-Adams attacks).
Temporary pacing may be needed for unresponsive bradycardia.
Chronic bradycardia necessitates permanent pacing.

Other causes of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances
Drugs (mostly those used to treat arrhythmias).
Cardiomyopathy.
Myocarditis.
Thyroid disease.
Electrolyte disturbances.

Heart failure
Heart failure is a clinical syndrome of effort intolerance which is due
to a cardiac abnormality and is usually associated with neurohumoral
adaptations leading to salt and water retention. Thus, heart failure is
a syndrome and not a diagnosis — i.e. the patient may have features
consistent with heart failure, but always ask what is the cause?

Causes of heart failure
Hypertension.
Ischaemic heart disease.
Heart muscle disease — cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, infiltrative
diseases (haemochromatosis, sarcoid, amyloid), Chagas' disease,
Beri-Beri.
Valvular heart disease — aortic stenosis/regurgitation, mitral
stenosis/regurgitation.
Pericardial disease — effusive/effusive-constrictive/constrictive
pericarditis.
Congenital heart disease.
Other causes — prolonged tachycardia, thyrotoxicosis, alcohol and
other toxins (e.g. chemotherapy, cocaine), pregnancy, severe
anaemia, Paget's disease, arteriovenous fistula,
phaeochromocytoma.
Fluid overload involves pushing the myocardium too far over the
Starling length-tension relationship (initially, stretching results in ↑
contractile force, but beyond the apex of the curve, further stretch
results in ↓ force), resulting in ↓ cardiac output. The neurohumoral
activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leads to salt
and water retention.
Based on clinical manifestations, heart failure may be classified as
left, right, or biventricular failure.

Left ventricular failure (LVF)
Dominated by pulmonary oedema, resulting in exertional dyspnoea,
orthopnoea, paradoxical nocturnal dyspnoea, wheeze, cough, and
fatigue.
Signs: tachypnoea, tachycardia, basal lung crackles, third heart
sound, pulsus alternans, cardiomegaly, peripheral cyanosis, pleural
effusion, ↓ peak expiratory flow.
CXR signs — see box.
ECG changes will depend on the specific cause.
Echocardiography may differentiate between valvular and
pericardial lesions.

Right ventricular failure (RVF)
RVF causes dependent oedema (i.e. in the legs if standing, in the
sacrum if supine), abdominal discomfort, nausea, fatigue, and wasting.
Usually s to chronic lung disease or LVF.
Signs: raised JVP, hepatomegaly (may be pulsatile if tricuspid
regurgitation is present), and pitting oedema.

Fig. 8.4 CXR changes in heart failure.

Management of heart failure
Identify and treat the cause if possible.
Treat reversible exacerbating factors (e.g. anaemia, arrhythmia,
electrolyte disturbance, infection, non-adherence to treatment).
Restrict salt and alcohol intake.
Avoid NSAIDs as they cause fluid retention. They may also interact
with diuretics and ACE inhibitors to cause renal failure.
Drug treatment:
Start with a diuretic (usually loop sealing) — monitor weight daily.
Adjust the dose of diuretic to achieve ‘dry weight’ with optimal

symptoms.
Once stabilized, begin an ACE inhibitor (see box).
Consider low-dose spironolactone (25-50 mg od) if available and
the patient is not hyperkalaemic, and/or adding an inotrope such
as digoxin.
Beta blockers: introduce cautiously once patient is clinically stable
(not in acute severe heart failure), starting at a low dose and
titrating up the dose slowly (‘start low, and go slow’).
Angiotensin receptor blockers: indicated in patients who do not
tolerate ACE inhibitors (e.g. cough, angioedema).
A combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine has been
shown to be effective add-on treatment in African-American
patients.

Treatment of resistant heart failure
Search for other causes and check patient compliance with drug
regimes and daily weighing.
Admit to hospital for bed rest, anti-thromboembolic stockings,
heparin 5000 units SC tds, furosemide IV up to 4 mg/min, and
training in the use of the weight scale in fluid and symptom
management.
Increase the ACE inhibitor or venodilator dose to the maximum
tolerated; consider metolazone where available. Often adding in a
thiazide to a loop diuretic will cause synergistic diuresis.
In extreme circumstances, consider using IV inotropes for a short
time only (e.g. dobutamine, starting at 2.5-10 mcg/kg/min, or
dopamine starting at 2-5 mcg/kg/min; increasing both according to
response up to a maximum of 40 mcg/kg/min (dobutamine) or 20-50
mcg/kg/min (dopamine)).
Sometimes a degree of peripheral oedema and exercise limitation
must be accepted in order to avoid unacceptable symptoms of low
output.

Starting an ACE inhibitor
Watch for hypotension after the 1st and 2nd doses.
Check the BP. If <100 mmHg systolic, give the first doses in
hospital if possible.
Ensure the patient is not salt or volume depleted (e.g. due to
D&V).
Check for aortic stenosis or mitral stenosis (relative
contraindication), and renal artery stenosis.
If there is symptomatic hypotension, give 0.9% sodium chloride
infusion (plus atropine if the patient is bradycardic).
Contraindications: significant hypotension, angioedema, renal
artery stenosis, pregnancy, porphyria.

Other precautions
Check U&Es and creatinine routinely and stop the ACE inhibitor if
there is significantly worsening renal function. However, urea and
Cr will often rise when ACE inhibitors or diuretics are first used.
This is not necessarily a reason to stop — levels will usually
plateau and drop later. Monitor closely; stop if Cr/urea increase
>20% or continue to rise.
Weigh the patient regularly to monitor the response and train the
patient to maintain ideal ‘dry weight’ by adjusting the diuretic
dose as needed.
Monitor WCC and urine protein if there is co-existent connective
tissue disease.
Beware of other interactions: Li+ (levels ↑), digoxin (levels may ↑),
NSAIDs (urea and K+ ↑), anaesthetics (BP ↓).
Watch for K+ derangement (usually ↓) through diuretic action. Mild
hypokalaemia is well tolerated without the need for K+-sparing
diuretics as long as: (i) the K+ is >3.5 mmol/l, (ii) there is no
predisposition to dysrrhythmias, and (iii) there are no other K+losing conditions (e.g. cirrhosis, chronic diarrhoea).
However, do not be put off trying a patient on an ACE inhibitor by

these cautions. Most patients tolerate them very well and gain a
significant benefit from them.

Shock
Shock is inadequate perfusion of vital organs due to hypotension.

Clinical features:
tachycardia (unless on beta blockers or in spinal shock), hypotension
(although in fit adults there may be >10% blood loss before any BP
change, which is often an initial rise in diastolic pressure — i.e. a
narrowing of the pulse pressure), pallor, faintness, sweating, and cold
peripheries with poor capillary refill.

Causes of shock
Cardiogenic shock
Failure of the heart to pump sufficient blood around the circulation. It
may occur rapidly or after progressive heart failure. It carries a high
mortality and may be due to dysrrhythmias, tamponade,
pneumothorax, MI, myocarditis, endocarditis, PE, aortic dissection,
drugs, hypoxia, sepsis, and acidosis.

Management:
Treat the cause, if known. Give O2 mask if hypoxaemic. Monitor ECG,
urine output, ABGs, U&Es, CVP. Consider inotropic agents (see previous
page) adjusted to keep the systolic BP >80 mmHg . Refer to a specialist
if possible.

Anaphylactic shock
— see box.

Endocrine failure

— see Addison's disease (

p 518) and hypothyroidism (

p 514).

Septic shock
— see

p 670.

Hypovolaemic shock
Due, for example, to trauma, ruptured aneurysm, or ectopic
pregnancy.
Management prevent further blood loss and aim to restore circulatory
volume as quickly as possible until the pulse rate falls and the BP starts
to rise. Give whole blood where possible (crossmatched if there is
time, otherwise use Rh -ve blood). Whilst waiting for blood to arrive,
give warmed crystalloids such as Hartmann's solution or a synthetic
colloid.
For the last two causes of shock, the immediate need is rapid IV fluid
replacement.

Points on fluid resuscitation
Use the largest vein and largest cannula possible.
Add pressure to the fluid bag to speed the infusion.
If access is difficult, it may be necessary to cut down to a vein (e.g.
2 cm above and anterior to the medial malleolus).
If this fails, intraosseous infusion is possible using specific cannulae
below and medial to the tibial tuberosity; especially useful in
children.
Give extra fluid if there are fractures: ribs 150 ml, tibia 650 ml,
femur 1500 ml, pelvis 2000 ml.
Double these estimates if there are open fractures.
Remember to splint fractures and apply traction to ↓ blood loss.

Anaphylaxis

Anaphylactic shock requires prompt energetic treatment of
laryngeal oedema, bronchospasm, and hypotension. It may be
caused by exposure to insect venom (bee stings), food (eggs,
peanuts), drugs (antibiotics, aspirin; especially if given IV) and other
medicinal products (e.g. vaccines, antivenom).

Management
1. Stop infusion if this has caused the anaphylaxis.
2. Secure the airway, give O2.
3. Give adrenaline 0.5 mg (0.5 ml of a 1:1000 solution) IM.
4. Repeat every 5 mins until BP and pulse both ↑. (Patients on noncardioselective beta-blockers may not respond to epinephrine in
usual doses; they may need salbutamol IV for 48 h.)
5. Give an antihistamine (e.g. chlorphenamine 10-20 mg by slow IV
injection). Continue this PO for 48 h.
6. Continuing deterioration requires additional treatment with IV
fluids and IV aminophylline or nebulized salbutamol. Assisted
ventilation and emergency tracheostomy (for laryngeal oedema)
may be required.
7. Give hydrocortisone 100-300 mg IV slowly; may need oral steroids
tapered for a few days depending on the antigen.
If there is doubt about the adequacy of the patient's circulation, it
may be necessary to give the epinephrine/adrenalin IV as a dilute
solution.
Anaphylactic reactions require prior exposure to the antigen.
Anaphylactoid reactions appear clinically similar but occur when
large quantities of allergen are infused IV (e.g. antivenoms rich in
Fc antibody portions). Prior skin testing does not exclude the
possibility of a subsequent anaphylactoid reaction since the reaction
is dependent on the quantity of antigen injected. Always have
adrenaline already drawn up when injecting antivenoms.

Hypertension
Hypertension (HT) is an increasing problem in the tropics, particularly

in urban areas, where lifestyles are becoming similar to those in the
West. Environmental factors are chiefly involved in this process, since
in these same countries, HT is virtually unheard of in rural
populations, living traditional lifestyles. It is a major risk factor for MI,
stroke, renal and heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.
Treatment aims to ↓ incidence/progress of complications.

Clinical features:
people are usually asymptomatic until irreversible damage has
occurred.

Symptoms:
dizziness, fatigue, headache, palpitations. Signs: raised BP (although
BP may be normal with heart failure); if 2° HT, there may be signs of
the 1° disease; end-organ damage (e.g. LV hypertrophy, heart failure,
retinopathy, proteinuria, uraemia). BP should be checked with the
correct sized cuff, sitting (erect and supine in the elderly/suspected
postural drop) after at least 5 and preferably 15 mins relaxing, and
checked twice.

Who to treat?
All patients should be advised to lose weight, exercise, ↓ Na intake/↑ K
intake, and address co-risk factors (e.g. smoking).
1. Where BP is >180 mmHg systolic or >95 mmHg diastolic, confirmed on
3 separate occasions over 1-2 days, treatment should be started. If
severe or in the presence of associated conditions (e.g. heart
failure), treat immediately — see box.
2. Where the initial BP is >140/90 over several weeks:
If no vascular or end organ complications and no diabetes, advise
non drug Rx and reassess in 3 months. If still high, start drug
therapy.
If any of the above are present, start drug therapy.
3. Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic >160 mmHg , diastolic <90

mmHg ) in persons >60 yrs should be monitored over 3 months and
treated if it persists, preferably with a low-dose thiazide diuretic ±
low-dose beta-blocker.
4. Hypertension during pregnancy can be treated with methyldopa;
beta-blockers and Ca2+ channel blockers can be used during the third
trimester.
5. In diabetics and patients with vascular risk factors, aim should be
BP<125/85.

Investigations:
recheck the BP on at least 3 separate occasions. Search for a cause
(particularly in the young). U&E, Cr, glucose, plasma lipids, MSU
(twice), renal USS, 24 h urinary catecholamines/urinary VMA, ECG,
CXR, fundoscopy.

Specific indications/agents and
contraindications
Carotid atherosclerosis — calcium channel blockers.
CHF — ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and spironolactone.
Chronic kidney disease — ACE inhibitor or ARB.
Diabetes — ACE inhibitor or ARB.
ECG left ventricular hypertrophy — ARB or ACE inhibitor.
IHD — beta-blockers, Ca channel blockers (not short-acting ones).
Resistant hypertension — spironolactone.
Secondary prevention of stroke — ACE inhibitor plus diuretic or ARB.
Reserpine — still used; cheap, effective, keep dose <0.5 mg/day.
PVD — beta-blockers exacerbate.
Gout — diuretics exacerbate/trigger.

Accelerated HT
Rapidly increasing BP with end-organ damage. It is heralded by sudden
onset heart failure, renal failure, encephalopathy (convulsions/coma),
or a diastolic BP >140 mmHg . Untreated, mortality is 90%; treated, it
carries a 5-yr survival of only 60%. See box for managment.

Management of HT
Aim to ↓ incidence of stroke, heart and renal failure, and MI.
Non-drug therapy.
Stop smoking (not itself a risk factor for HT; only for MI/stroke)
↓ sodium, alcohol intake, weight if obese
↑ intake of potassium, fresh vegetables, and fruit
↑ exercise
Drug therapy: explain that the patient may need to be on tablets
for life, even though had no symptoms, and may even feel worse.
Encourage patient to return to a doctor if there are unacceptable
side-effects and not simply to stop taking the medication.

Suggested approach
Start with a thiazide diuretic (e.g. bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg od
PO) as first-line therapy. Use lowest possible dose; check plasma
K+ 4 wks after starting therapy).
If not controlled, start either an ACE inhibitor (e.g. captopril 6.25
mg tds), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) if ACE inhibitor
intolerant, and/or a Ca2+ channel blocker (e.g. modified-release
nifedipine 10-40 mg PO bd) as 2nd- or 3rd-line therapy.
If still uncontrolled, add a beta-blocker (e.g. atenolol 25-50 mg PO
od) as 4th-line treatment.
If the HT is still not resolved (<10% will not respond to one or a
combination of these drugs), seek expert help before starting
centrally acting antihypertensives (e.g. moxonidine, clonidine) or
vasodilator agents (e.g. hydralazine).

Always try to stop ineffective drugs.

Management of accelerated HT
Bed rest, use of IV furosemide 40-80 mg, IV glyceryl nitrate 5-10
mcg/min, nifedipine 5 mg.
Drugs noted above for Rx of HT should be used.
Patients need close monitoring; may need specialist
evaluation/opinion. Dihydralazine should be used with caution.
Drop in BP over hrs or days, not mins (increased risk of stroke).
Do not lower BP in acute stroke unless >220/120. If so, lower
slowly by 15-20% every 24 h.

Rheumatic fever
Rheumatic fever (RF) is an important cause of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality throughout the developing world. Group A
beta-haemolytic streptococcal (Streptococcus pyogenes) pharyngitis
leads, in 3-6% of cases, to rheumatic fever, due to an immune crossreactivity between the bacteria and connective tissue.
It is a disease of the poor, the overcrowded, and the poorly housed,
with children being chiefly affected. The disease is often more severe
in the developing world than in the West. This severity reflects a
failure of health services to prevent recurrences of acute rheumatic
fever. If these recurrences can be prevented, many patients who have
carditis in their 1st attack will eventually lose their murmurs and have
normal or near normal hearts.

Clinical features
Arthritis: occurs in 80% of cases. Typically an asymmetrical and
migratory ‘flitting polyarthritis’ affecting large joints; the pain is
severe while swelling is often modest. Onset is acute and subsides
over a week; as one joint improves, a second gets worse. This
process may continue for 3-6 weeks. There is a dramatic response to
aspirin.

Carditis: occurs in 40-50%. It is the most serious manifestation of
acute RF, causing death acutely in <1% of cases. It may affect only
the endocardium (valvulitis, often MR ± AR, ‘mild carditis’), or the
myocardium and pericardium may also be involved (‘severe
carditis’).
Chorea: occurs in 10% after a longer incubation period. Sydenham's
chorea is emotional lability and involuntary movements (face, limbs,
esp. hands). More common in girls; one-third have no cardiac
involvement. Seldom affects those with arthritis.
Erythema marginatum: <5% cases.
Subcutaneous nodules: now rare.

Diagnosis:
Based upon the revised Jones criteria (see box) and requires (i)
evidence of recent streptococcal infection plus (ii) either two major
criteria, or one major and two minor criteria.

Management
Bed rest until the child feels better.
Anti-inflammatory drugs to suppress the inflammatory process:
Aspirin 20-25 mg/kg PO qds. Continue for 3-6 weeks if heart is not
involved; 3 months in mild carditis; 4-6 months in severe carditis.
In severe carditis, prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg qds may be given for 2
weeks.
Treat as for heart failure from other causes.
Sodium valproate 7.5-10 mg/kg PO bd for 3 months for chorea
(alternative haloperidol 0.05 mg/kg od).

Primary prevention of rheumatic fever
There is good trial evidence to show that the treatment of suspected
streptococcal pharyngitis in children with one dose of IM benzathine

penicillin ↓ the risk of developing rheumatic fever by 80%. Sixty
children need to be treated to prevent 1 episode of rheumatic fever.

Secondary prophylaxis is essential for all
patients
Give benzathine benzylpenicillin 1.2 million units (children <30 kg,
600,000 units) IM every 2-4 weeks, duration as follows:
>5 yrs or until age 21, whichever is the longer, for patients with
carditis but no residual heart disease.
5 yrs or until age 21 yrs, whichever is the longer, for patients who did
not have carditis.
Lifelong prophylaxis is recommended for patients with carditis and
residual heart (valvular) disease (WHO, 2004).
(Alternative for penicillin-allergic patients is erythromycin 250 mg bd
PO.)

Revised Jones criteria
A. Evidence of recent group A streptococcal infection
Positive throat culture or rapid streptococcal antigen test.
Elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titre.

B. Major manifestations
Carditis.
Polyarthritis.
Chorea.
Erythema marginatum.
Subcutaneous nodules.

C. Minor manifestations
Clinical findings
Arthralgia.
Fever.

Laboratory findings
Elevated acute-phase reactants (ESR or C-reactive protein).
Prolonged PR interval.
Any effort that will make the IM injection less painful, and therefore
less frightening for the child, will make 2° prophylaxis more
successful. Painful monthly IM injections for a young child can be a
very frightening prospect that could make the child unwilling to
take this life-saving treatment.

Infective endocarditis
Fever + regurgitant murmur = endocarditis until
proven otherwise.
50% of endocarditis is on normal valves. When it is caused by highly
pathogenic bacteria like staphylococci, pneumococci, and βhaemolytic streptococci, endocarditis follows an acute course, often
with serious emboli, heart failure, and death. The course is subacute if
Streptococcus viridans affects valves previously damaged by RF or
other causes. Endocarditis often occurs on prosthetic valves (2%), in
which case the involved valves often need replacing.

Pathogenesis
Any bacteraemia, especially following dental procedures, GU
manipulation, or surgery may expose the valves to colonization. In the
UK, Streptococci viridans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus
aureus are common. Rarely fungi, Coxiella, or Chlamydia species infect
valves; Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E. coli ) almost never cause
infective endocarditis. Rare non-infective causes include SLE and
malignancy. Right-sided disease is more common in IV drug users,
leading to pulmonary abscesses.

Clinical features
Include evidence of:

Infection: fever, malaise, night sweats, finger clubbing,
splenomegaly, anaemia.
Heart murmurs: especially regurgitation of aortic or mitral valves;
sometimes murmurs change from day to day — not because the
vegetation is changing rapidly, but because fever accentuates the
murmur and because valve regurgitation may suddenly develop.
Usually, the murmurs deteriorate until treatment is effective.
Embolic events: vegetations on valves may cause embolic events
(e.g. strokes or acute limb ischaemia). Occasionally, embolic
abscesses or mycotic aneurysms form.
Vasculitis: microscopic haematuria, splinter haemorrhages, Osler
nodes (painful lesions on finger pulps), Janeway lesions (painful red
patches on the palms), Roth spots (on fundoscopy), and renal failure.

Diagnosis
Take 3 blood cultures from different sites at different times — it is not
necessary to time the cultures with fever spikes, as the bacteraemia is
relatively constant. Always take blood cultures before starting
antibiotics — a delay of a few hours is seldom critical. At least one
culture will be positive in 99% of cases. ESR, FBC, U&E, Cr,
echocardiography may show the vegetations on valves. Perform
urinalysis for haematuria.

Management
For fully sensitive streptococcal infection, give benzylpenicillin 1.2 g
IV q4 h plus synergistic doses of gentamicin 60-80 mg IV bd for 2 weeks.
Then, if there is a good clinical response, switch to amoxicillin 1 g PO
tds for 2 weeks. Less sensitive streptococcal isolates require 4 weeks of
penicillin plus gentamicin. For S. aureus infections, give flucloxacillin 2
g IV q4-6 h and gentamicin as above for 2 weeks, then IV flucloxacillin
for 2 weeks.
Use vancomycin or teicoplanin if MRSA suspected. For S. epidermidis
infections, use vancomycin and rifampicin for ≥4 weeks.

If ‘blind’ empirical therapy is required, give benzylpenicillin and
gentamicin and add in flucloxacillin if the endocarditis is acute in
onset. Wait for blood culture results. This recommendation is based on
streptococcal infections being the most common cause of endocarditis.
Alter these recommendations according to the local circumstances.

Prognosis
30% mortality in the UK from staphylococcal endocarditis, 14% with
anaerobic infection, and 6% with sensitive streptococci.

Prevention
Prophylaxis required
Previous history of endocarditis.
Prosthetic valves.
Congenital heart disease (except secundum ASD).
All acquired valvular heart disease.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with mitral regurgitation.
Mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation.
Surgically corrected shunts/conduits.

Prophylaxis not required
Previous CABG.
Pacemakers/implated cardio-defibrillators.
Mitral valve disease without regurgitation.
Previous rheumatic fever without valve defects.
‘Innocent’ murmurs.

Procedures requiring prophylaxis

Any dental procedure that causes bleeding from gingiva, mucosa, or
bone.
Tonsillectomy.
Rigid bronchoscopy.
Incision of abscess.
Vaginal delivery with chorioaminonitis.
‘Dirty’ surgery/procedure.

Procedures not requiring prophylaxis
Natural shedding of teeth.
Caesarian section.
Vaginal delivery without infection.
‘Clean’ procedures.

Antibiotics
Amoxicillin 3 g PO 1 h before procedure under local anesthetic.
If allergic to penicillin or >1 course of penicillin in last month, give
clindamycin 600 mg PO 1 h before procedure.
For procedures under general anaesthetic, give amoxicillin 3 g PO 4
h before the procedure and again as soon as possible after the
procedure.
For procedures under general anaesthetic in patients at high risk
(antibiotics in the previous month, prosthetic valve, or allergic to
penicillin), refer all procedures to hospital. Amoxicillin plus
gentamicin (or vancomycin in penicillin-allergic patients) can be
used for such patients.

Cardiomyopathies
Disease of the myocardium → cardiac dysfunction, resulting in heart
failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death.

1. Dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy
Cause may not be identifiable, but recognised causes include alcohol,
unrecognized HT, pregnancy, HIV, or previous myocarditis.

Clinical features:
are of heart failure. Apex diffuse and displaced, often functional
valvular incompetence and murmurs. May be AF (especially in
alcoholics) and associated emboli. Typically, the patient is male 40-50
years old. HIV cardiomyopathy occurs in younger patients.

Diagnosis and management:
echocardiography shows a dilated hypokinetic heart with involvement
of all cardiac chambers. However, in HIV-associated cardiomyopathy
the left ventricle may be of normal size but severely hypokinetic.
Evaluation is in three stages:
1. Non-invasive clinical evaluation — reversible causes including HT,
alcoholism, thyrotoxicosis, infiltration (iron, amyloid, sarcoid)
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, DM, myocarditis, and
phaeochromocytoma must be excluded.
2. Invasive evaluation — coronary angiography and endomyocardial
biopsy in patients with risk factors for IHD or ECG suggestive of MI or
when infiltrative disorders or myocarditis are suspected.
3. Family evaluation — if no cause found, screen 1st degree relatives by
ECG and echo to exclude familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Full
evaluation yields a cause in 50-75% cases. Cause linked to prognosis;
investigation important when possible. Mortality of idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy high — 40% by 3 yrs.

2. Peripartum cardiomyopathy
Dilated cardiomyopathy beginning in last month of pregnancy or <5
months postpartum, with no other history of heart failure and with no
discernible cause for the heart failure.

Risk factors:
high parity, age, low socio-economic status. Myocarditis found in 50% in
some series, but mechanism unclear. Cultural practices such as eating
Na+-rich foods in hot climates during pregnancy may have a role. The
combination of increased circulatory demand (± anaemia), heat (→
peripheral vasodilatation), and high salt load might lead to a high
output dilated cardiac failure.

Investigation and management:
as for heart failure. In about 50% cases there is irreversible cardiac
dysfunction. Dysrrhythmias, persistently dilated heart, and systemic or
pulmonary emboli mark poor prognosis. Consider sterilization in
patients with irreversible cardiac dysfunction beyond 6 months followup.

3. Restrictive cardiomyopathy
Due to endomyocardial stiffening, resembling constrictive pericarditis.
Often due to endomyocardial fibrosis in which hypereosinophilia
(possibly triggered by helminthic infection, especially filariasis)
damages the myocardium. Mural thrombus formation produces a
fibrotic mass. Rare causes are amyloid or carcinoid.

Clinical features:
may begin with a febrile illness, facial oedema, and dyspnoea that may
progress to death within months. Most patients are seen in chronic
stage with heart failure. Clinical features may be either LV or RV, or a
combination. LV disease consists of MR (never MS or AR cf. RF) with an
S3, and progressive pulmonary hypertension. RV disease (usually TR)
results in gross ascites and markedly elevated JVP but often minimal
peripheral oedema. May be exophthalmos, central cyanosis, delayed
puberty, ↓ pulse pressure, and AF. Murmurs may be heard (cf.
pericardial disease). Pericardial effusion common in endomyocardial
fibrosis.

Diagnosis:
CXR varies from massive cardiac shadow (aneurysm of R atrium, or
pericardial effusion) to almost normal. Echo and Doppler studies show
fibrosis of inflow tracts with involvement of ventricles and
regurgitation of mitral and tricuspid valves. Pericardial effusion and
thrombi in the atria or ventricles also seen.

Management:
Acute treatment is supportive. If there is hyper-eosinophilia, look for
and treat cause. In established disease, resist the temptation to drain
the ascites, since it may cause the patient to lose protein. Digoxin may
control ventricular rate if there is AF.

4. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is unexplained ventricular hypertrophy
(i.e. hypertrophy in absence of hypertension, aortic stenosis, DM,
obesity, or other cause) leading to obstruction of the LV outflow tract
in 20% cases (i.e. hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, HOCM).
Over 90% of cases show autosomal dominant inheritance. Genetic
counselling and screening of 1st degree relatives essential.

Clinical features:
Dyspnoea, angina, syncope, palpitations. May be a double impulse at
apex, jerky pulse, S4, late systolic murmur. ECG almost always
abnormal, showing LVH, Q waves, and deep T-wave inversion. ECG
abnormalities precede the echocardiographic onset of cardiac
hypertrophy which manifests from adolescence onwards.

Management:
Beta-blockers for angina and treat dysrrhythmias. Uncontrolled AF
needs anticoagulation. Consider high-risk patients (i.e. family history
of sudden death, syncope, abnormal BP response to exercise) for
implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

5. Acute myocarditis
Inflammation of myocardium, may present like an MI. Causes: viral
(coxsackie virus), diphtheria, RF, drugs, other infections; Angina,
dyspnoea, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and heart failure. Exclude MI,
pericardial effusion. Management is supportive.

6. Left atrial myxoma
Rare benign tumour, developing from atrial septum causing left atrial
obstruction (as in MS), emboli, AF, fever, weight loss, and raised ESR.
May be a family history. Rarely, a tumour ‘plop’ on auscultation. 2:1
female excess. Differentiate from MS by occurrence of emboli without
AF or on echo. Treatment: excision. May recur.

Pericardial disease
Pericarditis
In the tropics, this is commonly due to TB or pyogenic infection.
Tuberculous pericarditis is especially important in the areas of high
HIV prevalence. Spread is probably from the adjacent lymph nodes
and pleura. The effusion may be massive in HIV; echocardiogram
may show strands of fibrin floating in the effusion.
Acute pyogenic pericarditis results from generalized bacteraemia
derived from, or associated with, a 1° focus elsewhere.
Other causes: any infection (especially coxsackie virus), malignancy
(such as KS in HIV +ve people), uraemia, MI, Dressler syndrome,
trauma, radiotherapy, connective tissue diseases, and
hypothyroidism.

Clinical features
Pericarditis: a sharp constant sternal pain, which may radiate to the
left shoulder, down the left arm, or to the abdomen. It is relieved by
sitting forward, and worse by lying on the left, coughing, inspiring, or

swallowing. Auscultation may reveal a scratchy superficial pericardial
rub, loudest at the left sternal edge. In a large effusion, the rub is
generally lost, and heart sounds are heard faintly.
Pericardial effusion: depends on the speed at which it is formed. If
formed quickly, the pericardium cannot stretch and so pressure rises
and the heart is compressed to produce cardiac tamponade. There is a
fall of cardiac output (↓ BP), ↑ JVP, Kussmaul sign (JVP rises with
inspiration), tachycardia, impalpable apex, pulsus paradoxus,
peripheral shut down, and quiet heart sounds. In more chronic
effusions, signs of heart failure predominate with severe ascites and
hepatomegaly. Percussion reveals an increased area of cardiac dullness
in the retrosternal and right parasternal areas, and the apex beat is
impalpable or felt within the area of dullness. Impending tamponade
or restriction is first indicated by elevated JVP; however, the JVP may
be so high that the patient must be examined sitting or standing
upright. Patients with pyogenic pericarditis are extremely unwell with
signs of severe sepsis.

Diagnosis:
ECG classically shows upwardly concave (saddle shaped) ST segments
in all leads except lead AVR, with no reciprocal changes. In pericardial
effusions, CXR shows a large globular heart (and may show pleural
effusions). ECG has low voltages and changing QRS complexes
(electrical alternans = a changing axis beat to beat). Echocardiography
is diagnostic with an echo-free zone showing the heart surrounded by
effusion. In exudative effusions, fibrinous strands are clearly seen
within the fluid. Differentiate from an MI and PE.

Constrictive pericarditis
Encasement of the heart in a non-expansive pericardium, usually
following TB infection. Features are as for chronic effusion; however,
the heart is small on CXR and may show calcification, especially on the
lateral CXR. The onset is usually insidious, with ascites, oedema,
hepatomegaly, proteinuria being found. The patient may or may not be
breathless. Often the JVP is so far elevated that it is missed on routine

inspection of the neck.

Management
Pericarditis: find and treat the cause.
Give analgesia with NSAIDs if pericardial pain is present.
For TB pericarditis, commence anti-TB treatment for 6 months and
perform an HIV test. It is uncertain whether adjunctive steroids
prevent death or constriction.
Pericardial effusion: find and treat the cause (e.g. antibiotics for
bacterial infections; anti-TB drugs for TB).
Tamponade requires urgent drainage. Aspirate with a 50 ml syringe,
fitted with a long needle and two-way tap, inserting upwards and to
the left of the xiphisternum. Patient should be propped up 45°.
Watch the ECG monitor to know if the myocardium is touched.
Adjunctive steroids are effective in reducing the re-accumulation of
pericardial fluid.
Recurrent pericardial effusion, especially of pyogenic origin,
requires surgery draining through a pericardial window or
pericardiotomy.
Constrictive pericarditis: requires surgical excision of the
pericardium.

Assessing renal function
The kidneys regulate fluid, electrolyte, and acid base balance;
eliminate potentially toxic substances; and produce renin and
erythropoietin. The renal tubular synthesis of 1,25dihydroxycholecalciferol from the major circulating form of vitamin D,
25-hydroxycholecalciferol, is catalyzed by the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase.

Serum creatinine:
is simple to measure and widely available. However, the serum
creatinine concentration remains in the normal range until the GFR
has fallen by around 40%. It is therefore not a useful measure of early
renal impairment.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR):
The normal range for the GFR is 88-174 ml/min in men and 87-147
ml/min in women. GFR is estimated by calculating the creatinine
clearance (CCr). This requires a 24-hour urine collection; for this
reason, equations have been devised to estimate either the creatinine
clearance or GFR and these are widely used.

Calculated creatinine clearance (Cockroft Gault
formula)
This formula is widely used for the calculation of creatinine clearance
from the serum creatinine but suffers from the limitations inherent to
the inaccuracies of measuring serum creatinine.

In females, the result is factored by 0.85 to account for lower
creatinine production.

Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
estimation of GFR.
This is calculated as follows:
GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) = 186 × (Creatinine (µmol/l × 0.0113)-1.154 × age0.203.
In females multiply result × 0.742; in Afro-Caribbeans multiply × 1.21. A
useful table and online calculator for estimating the MDRD GFR can be
downloaded from http://www.renal.org/eGFR/about.html

Urine analysis
Colour: see box opposite.
Transparency: cloudiness may be due to infection, blood, pus, chyle,
or crystals of phosphate (white) or urate (yellow).
Smell: an unpleasant smell is commonly due to a UTI (bacteria split
urea to release ammonia). Antibiotics or vitamins may also cause a
smell.
Specific gravity (SG): normally 1.002-1.025. A low SG suggests
diabetes insipidus; a high SG suggests dehydration or diabetes
mellitus (large amounts of dissolved glucose).

Chemical analysis

Dipsticks can be used to detect pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood,
urobilinogen, bilirubin, and nitrites in the urine. If dipsticks are not
available,
simple lab tests can be used to detect urine abnormalities (e.g. heat
coagulation test for protein and Benedict's test for reducing
substances).
pH: the urine is normally acidic (range 4.5-8.0).
Protein: see proteinuria (

p 366).

Glucose: modern dipsticks are specific for glucose. The Benedict's
test detects reducing substances in the urine (glycosuria, salicylates,
ascorbic acid, and galactose). Renal glycosuria is an impaired ability
of the kidney tubules to reabsorb glucose, and may be due to normal
variant or be part of renal tubular disease (e.g. Faconi's syndrome).
Ketones: are found in diabetic ketoacidosis and starving patients.
Nitrites: their presence suggests a UTI, but their absence does not
exclude it. False positives may be seen after a protein-rich meal or
vitamin C ingestion.
Blood: dipsticks rely on the peroxidase activity of Hb. Intact red cells
give a punctate staining, while free Hb or myoglobin give a
homogeneous colour. Confirm by urine microscopy — intact red cells
will be seen in haematuria, but not haemoglobinuria or
myoglobinuria.

Abnormal urinary sediment
The urine is centrifuged, supernatant poured off, and the sediment
then microscoped.

Cells
Red cells: see haematuria (
p 368).
Leukocytes: usually indicates a UTI. May also occur in
glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis. If a sterile pyuria
persists, consider TB of the urinary tract.

Casts
Hyaline casts or fine granular casts: consist of mucoprotein and
are a non-specific finding. Found in normal urine, febrile illnesses,
after exercise, in concentrated urine, and in renal disease.
Coarse granular casts: granules derive from degeneration of
embedded cells. They are more usually pathological and are seen
in glomerulonephritis.
Red cell casts: indicate glomerular bleeding and are a sign of
glomerulonephritis.
White cell casts: indicate an acute pyelonephritis.

Proteinuria
Normal protein excretion is <150 mg/day and includes albumin (<30
mg/day), Tamm-Horsfall protein, and other small proteins.
Microalbuminuria: is daily excretion of between 30-300 mg
albumin/24 h. It is not detected by dipsticks — special methods are
needed for detection. It is abnormal and an early feature of diabetic
nephropathy.
Dipsticks become positive for protein when albuminuria is >300
mg/24 h (macroalbuminuria).
Dipsticks are very sensitive to albumin but are insensitive to BenceJones protein and light chains found in urine in myeloma.

If persistent proteinuria is present, the next step should be to quantify
this. Most centres now use a urine albumin/creatinine ratio or a urine
protein/creatinine ratio rather than a 24-h urine protein excretion.

Causes of persistent proteinuria
Postural (orthostatic) proteinuria: absent proteinuria after overnight
rest, but mild proteinuria after 2 h of standing and quiet walking.
Patients are asymptomatic and have no haematuria; other
investigations are normal. Renal Bx is not indicated and long-term
prognosis excellent.
Renal disease.
Other causes: exercise induced, CCF.

Chyluria
Chyle in the urine makes it resemble milk or rice water. It results from
rupture of lymphatic varices, producing a fistula between the
lymphatic system and urinary tract. It is relatively common in the
tropics, especially where filariasis is prevalent. It must be
differentiated from pyuria, phosphaturia, and lipuria. A rose/pink
colouration to the urine may mean that there is also haematuria.
Commonly caused by parasites blocking lymphatics, often W.
bancrofti.
Non-parasitic chyluria is rare and usually involves stenosis or
obstruction of the thoracic duct (eg. neoplastic infiltration, trauma,
TB).

Clinical features:
usually relapse and remit over a long period. Main symptom is passage
of milky white urine; there may be loin pain, ureteric colic, passage of
clots (may cause retention), and fever.

Diagnosis:

urine microscopy reveals chylomicrons and fat globules. IVU,
cystoscopy (2 h after a fatty meal) to detect site of lesion;
lymphography may be required. Look for a cause. Measure 24-h urine,
protein excretion, and serum proteins (to assess albumin loss).

Management:
treat filariasis, although lesions may be irreversible; >50% resolve
spontaneously. A low-fat diet and a high fluid intake reduces the risk of
urinary stasis and clot formation. If the chyluria is severe and/or
accompanied by episodes of dysuria, colic, retention, and/or weight
loss, surgical repair should be considered.

Haematuria

P.368

Blood in the urine always requires investigation. It may be:
Microscopic: with ≥5 red blood cells per high-powered field, or
Macroscopic: (i.e. seen with the naked eye) if >0.5 ml of blood is
present per litre of urine.
While almost half of patients presenting with haematuria in the West
have neoplastic lesions, in the developing world, a large number of
other diseases present with bleeding from the urinary tract.

Causes
Surgical: renal stone disease; transitional cell or squamous
carcinoma of the bladder, ureter, or pelvis; renal cell carcinoma;
trauma; benign prostatic hyperplasia; AV malformations.
Medical: UTI, schistosomiasis, TB, glomerular disease (IgA
nephropathy, glomerular nephritis, SLE), polycystic kidneys (PCK),
infarction, bleeding diatheses.

Investigating haematuria
Focus on stones, urological malignancy, UTIs and schistosomiasis (in
endemic areas) before considering the rarer medical causes. Ask the

following questions:
Is it true haematuria? Check other causes of red urine (see
365).

p

What is its timing in relation to micturition? Early haematuria
suggests a low (urethral/genital) bleeding site, while late
haematuria (i.e. at the end of voiding) suggests a bladder site; red
colouration throughout micturition implies a ureteric or renal lesion.
Is the haematuria painful? Carcinoma and schistosomiasis tend to
be painless, whilst cystitis, obstruction (e.g. stones), and infection
are commonly painful.
Is there? dysuria and fever (UTI), poor stream (urethral/bladder neck
lesion), loin pain (ureteric obstruction due to tumour, stone, or clot),
family history (PCK), or a history of trauma.

Diagnosis:
urine microscopy (red cell casts and dysmorphic red cells suggest
glomerular bleeding), culture, and cytology of a midstream urine
sample; renal USS; IVU; cystoscopy, FBC, blood urea.

Haemoglobinuria:
is caused by intravascular haemolysis due to toxins/venoms,
falciparum malaria, incompatible blood transfusions, G6PD deficiency,
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, chronic cold agglutinin
disease, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, march
haemoglobinuria.

Myoglobinuria:
is caused by rhabdomyolysis (muscle destruction) after muscle injury,
excessive contraction (convulsions, hyperthermia, very heavy
exercise), viral myositis (influenza, legionnaires' disease), and
drugs/toxins (alcohol, snake venoms). Myoglobinuria may be
idiopathic.

Urinary schistosomiasis
Schistosoma haematobium causes urinary schistosomiasis in Africa and
parts of the Middle East. S. intercalatum and hybrid species between S.
haematobium and other species can produce atypical clinical pictures,
with ectopic localization of worms. For distribution and life cycle, see
p 315. Worm eggs stimulate a T-cell-mediated immune response,
producing eosinophilic granulomata in the bladder, uterus, and
genitals. Eggs may also affect the GI tract, lungs, liver, skin, and CNS.

Transmission
Depends on
Human (definitive host) availability and water-contact activities.
Bulinus snails (intermediate host).
S. haematobium strain.
The host-parasite relationship.
The host's immune response.
Prevalence increases to a peak at 15 yrs, after which there is a plateau
until 30 yrs, at which point it begins to decline (due to age-related
changes in water-contact, increased immunity, and death of adult
worms).

Clinical features
Egg deposition: begins 3 months after infection, often accompanied
by painless haematuria which may persist for months-yrs, together
with dysuria, pain, malaise, and mild fever.
Established infection: haematuria often decreases in the chronic
stage, unless there is 2° infection, ulceration, or malignancy.
Fibrosis and calcification of the bladder reduce its volume,
producing frequency and dribbling. Other complications include
perineal fistulae and 2° bacterial infection. In severe cases, there
may be urinary retention, stasis, stone formation, and renal failure.

In men, involvement of the seminal vesicles causes eggs to shed in
semen (‘lumpy’ semen); prostate, epididymis, and penis are
uncommonly affected. In women, ulcerating, polypoid, or nodular
lesions may be seen in the vulva, vagina, and cervix. The ovaries,
fallopian tubes, and uterus are rarely affected. S. haematobium
infection may be associated with ectopic pregnancies and infertility.

Diagnosis
Visualization of parasite eggs in the urinary sediment, bladder
biopsies, or rectal mucosal snips. Schistosome antigens may also be
detected immunologically. Antibodies to Schistosoma develop 6-12
weeks post exposure and serology can be performed at this time
(ELISA). Look for bladder calcification on AXR (‘foetal head’ sign); IVU
may be useful, and USS can show bladder wall thickening or
hydronephrosis.

Treatment
See
p 317. Praziquantel is effective against all species of
schistosomes; a single dose of 40-60 mg/kg usually being curative. The
patient should be followed up at 2 and 6 months for urinalysis and
clinical assessment of improvement.

S. haematobium and bladder cancer
The association between bladder cancer and chronic heavy S
haematobium infection is well-recognized. There is a lag period of
at least 20 yrs between infection and the development of cancer.
75% of patients (with squamous carcinoma) in Egypt are <50 yrs old;
by contrast, in non-schistosome areas, most patients (with
adenocarcinoma) are >65 yrs. It is more common in males, smokers,
and those working with aromatic amines (e.g. in the rubber
industry).

Clinical features:
haematuria, cystitis, and obstruction. Spread is local to pelvic
structures, via the lymphatics to the iliac and paraaortic nodes, and
via the blood to liver and lungs.

Investigation:
urinalysis, FBC. AXR may show a calcified bladder wall. IVU,
cystoscopy, and biopsy. Staging is as follows:
T1 — tumour in mucosa or submucosa. Not felt at examination under
anaesthesia (EUA).
T2 — superficial muscle involved. Rubbery thickening at EUA.
T3 — deep muscle involved. Mobile mass at EUA.
T4 — invasion beyond bladder. Fixed mass at EUA.

Management:
T1 and T2 — cystoscopic diathermy. Consider intravesicular
chemotherapy or BCG administration. T3 — radical surgery and
radiotherapy. T4 — palliation (long-term catheterization).

Fig. 9.1 Bladder calcification in urinary schistosomiasis — the
‘foetal head’ sign. Such patients commonly have well-preserved
bladder function.

Kidney lumps
Enlarged kidneys tend to bulge forwards, whilst perinephric abscesses
or collections tend to bulge backwards. A tender loin mass may suggest
an obstructed kidney but, if there is evidence of psoas muscle spasm, a
perinephric abscess is more likely. With acute obstruction, or
development of pyonephrosis, guarding is common and the mass
difficult to define. With chronic obstructed states and tumours, the

mass is usually better defined and less tender. Bilateral, irregular
kidneys suggest polycystic renal disease. A horseshoe kidney may
present as a central abdominal mass, whilst ectopic kidneys may be
felt lower in the loins, in the iliac fossae, or even suprapubically.

Kidney tumours
There are three main types of renal tumours:
1. Nephroblastoma: (Wilm's tumour): is an undifferentiated
mesodermal tumour of children which may be sporadic or familial;
95% are unilateral.
2. Urothelial tumours: may arise in the renal pelvis, ureters, urethra,
or bladder. In the West, transitional cell carcinoma accounts for 90%
of urothelial malignancies, whilst in Africa squamous CA
predominates due to a high incidence of urinary schistosomiasis.
Tumours may lead to chronic urethral strictures, obstruction, and
recurrent infection.
3. Renal carcinoma (hypernephroma): the majority of renal cell
carcinomas are clear cell carcinomas. Classic symptoms are of loin
pain, a mass, and frank haematuria. Anaemia and hepatic
dysfunction are commonly present, sometimes with polycythaemia
due to increased erythropoietin secretion. These tumours are often
discovered as an incidental finding on ultrasound.

Diagnosis:
by imaging with USS or CT scan and CXR (for metastases).

Management:
Standard treatment of localized tumours is by radical unilateral
nephrectomy. Five-year survival in patients with localized disease is
90% but this falls to 9% in patients with metastatic disease. Drug
treatments have been disappointing so far.

Genitourinary hydatid disease

After passage through the portal system, right heart, and pulmonary
circulation, eggs of Echinococcus granulosus and E multilocularis may
come to rest in the genitourinary system. Cysts form in the kidney,
bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis, in descending
frequency. For details, see
p 288.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is a single
gene disease occurring in ~1 in 500 live births and a major cause of
chronic kidney disease. 85-90% of cases are due to a germ line
mutation in the PKD1 gene and 10-15% due to a mutation in the PKD2
gene that encode the proteins polycystin1 and 2, respectively.

Clinical features:
The main symptoms are renal pain, gross haematuria, and urinary
infections but the diagnosis can be made with an incidental finding
of an abdominal mass. Hypertension is common; its treatment slows
progression of renal failure. Cysts are commonly found in the liver
and pancreas. Some families have intracerebral aneurysms that may
lead to intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Over 50% of patients develop end-stage renal failure. End-stage
renal failure or death develops earlier in patients with PKD1 (53
years) than in those with PKD2 (69.1 years).

Diagnosis:
USS shows enlarged kidneys with characteristic multiple cysts. Look
for a family history.

Management:
Supportive. Treat hypertension and UTIs. For infected cysts, cotrimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin have good penetration. Manage
bleeding conservatively. CRF is the usual cause of death unless there
is access to dialysis or transplantation. Consider screening family
members for asymptomatic disease. Most affected individuals have
cysts by age 20 years.

Autosomal recessive polycystic disease
This is less common than the autosomal dominant variety and is
found in 1 in 20,000 live births. Often causes death in utero or in the
neonatal period from pulmonary atresia. Renal failure and fibrosis
develop in those children who survive.

Urinary tract infection (UTI)
UTIs may progress rapidly in the tropics and complications are
common, especially in the malnourished. Infection is commonly due to
gram-negative gut organisms, most frequently E. coli (70%). UTIs are
common in women.

Clinical features
Cystitis: abrupt onset of frequency, dysuria, urgency, supra pubic
pain, and tenderness; occasionally haematuria, incontinence,
retention.
Acute pyelonephritis: features of cystitis, plus high fever ± rigors,
loin pain, nausea and vomiting, D&V (in children).

Ask about:
previous infections including STD, recent urinary instrumentation,
diabetes, childhood UTI, known urinary tract abnormalities, renal

colic, stone disease, obstructive uropathy.

Examine for:
loin tenderness, renal mass, large prostate, meatal ulcers, vaginal
discharge, pelvic mass on vaginal examination, hypertension, signs of
CRF.

Is it a complicated UTI?
UTI in a male is usually caused by prostatic hypertrophy, sometimes
with prostatitis. UTIs in pregnant women should be treated with care,
as premature labour may follow. Complicated UTIs often complicate
urinary tract abnormality (congenital, obstruction, calculi); reflux;
neurogenic bladder; recent urinary instrumentation; female genital
mutilation. UTI in a child is often a sign of vesico-ureteric reflux,
urethral stricture, or other abnormalities. Diabetes and
immunosuppression predispose to UTIs.

Diagnosis
Ask for a clean-catch midstream urine specimen. Sterile bags are
useful in infants and children. Visually inspect the urine for turbidity
and haematuria. Test the urine for leukocytes and nitrites (blood and
protein alone have low specificity/sensitivity). Send specimens for
microscopy (pyuria, bacteria, epithelial cells) and culture. Pyuria with
a growth >105 colony forming units per mL of urine, of a single
recognized urinary pathogen, confirms UTI. However, genuine mixed
growth may occur in complicated UTI and lower counts may be
significant, particularly in men and with slow-growing organisms.

Perform further investigations:
if recurrent UTI, first UTI in men, UTI in children, overt or persistent
haematuria, sterile pyuria. Recurrent UTIs in infants, particularly with
reflux, may be a cause of progressive renal failure.

Further investigations:

include USS, IVU, micturating cystourethrogram and DMSA scan for
scars in children.

Sterile pyuria
Consider partially treated UTI, TB or other atypical organisms,
chlamydia, candida, calculi, bladder tumour, prostatitis, papillary
necrosis (the elderly, over-use of NSAIDs), polycystic kidneys,
appendicitis.

Management of a UTI
Advise increasing fluid intake, frequent voiding, double
micturition, and post-coital voiding.
Antibiotic treatment should be started empirically. Be guided by
local sensitivities. Except for pregnant women, asymptomatic
bacteriuria does not usually require antibiotics.

Lower tract infection (cystitis):
3-5 days of any of the following: trimethoprim 200 mg BD;
ciprofloxacin 500 mg BD; cefalexin 500 mg BD.

Upper tract infection (pyelonephritis) or complicated
UTI:
2 weeks of antibiotics. Start with IV 3rd generation cephalosporin
(e.g. ceftriaxone 2 g OD) or ampicillin 1 g 6-hrly plus ciprofloxacin;
with clinical improvement, change to one of the oral agents used
for lower tract UTI (ideally guided by microbiology results) but
continue for 2 weeks total.
If the urinary tract is obstructed (urethral valves/stricture,
prostate, stones), urgent decompression is required (urinary
catheter; suprapubic catheter; nephrostomy — guided by USS).

Recurrent UTIs:
emphasize frequent voiding and double micturition. Short-term
prophylactic antibiotics (e.g trimethoprim 100 mg at night) may
break the cycle of infections. Cefalexin 500 mg after sexual
intercourse may be helpful. Investigate children under 5 years for
reflux nephropathy and tract abnormalities.

Renal calculi and renal colic
Renal and ureteric calculi are less common in agricultural economies
than in the West, and are seen less frequently in Africa than Asia and
the Middle-East. M:F ratio is 2.5:1. Epidemiological factors such as
diet, affluence, climate, and metabolic factors are significant.
Congenital renal abnormalities (e.g. polycystic disease, horseshoe
kidney) with urinary stasis, GU schistosomiasis, and TB predispose to
stone disease. Overall, 80% of stones are calcium oxalate; triple
phosphate stones (staghorn calculi) are associated with UTI, usually
Proteus spp; uric acid and cysteine stones are uncommon.

Clinical features:
can occur at any point in the urinary tract. Stones in the ureter cause
renal colic with sudden onset of agonising paroxysms of pain. The pain
radiates from the loin to groin and the patient often cannot lie still.
Kidney stones may cause loin pain with abdominal/loin tenderness with
haematuria. Bladder stones cause strangury — urgent desire to pass
something which will not pass. Common sites of obstruction are vesicoureteric and pelvi-ureteric junctions.

Diagnosis:
Kidney-Ureters-Bladder (KUB) AXR for calculi (90% of urinary stones are
radio opaque). Dipstick for blood. Screen for UTI. USS or IVU to look for
stone and obstruction. Blood tests: U&E, uric acid, Ca2+, bicarbonate.

Management
1. Increase fluid intake. Treat infection.
2. Give pain relief: NSAIDs (beware renal impairment) or opiates for
severe colic.
3. Most stones will pass spontaneously: >70% of ureteric stones <4 mm
wide will pass spontaneously in one year while <10% of stones > 8 mm
wide will pass. Stones that are likely to pass without complications

can be managed conservatively.
4. If there is obstruction, infection, or bilateral involvement, seek
urgent urological advice. Decompress the renal tract before renal
failure occurs. Stones can sometimes be removed by extracorporeal
shock wave lithotripsy or surgery.

Prevention:
avoid oxalate-rich foods (spinach, beetroot, green peppers, almonds,
cashew nuts, cocoa, grapefruit juice, orange juice, black tea, cola
drinks) and excessive dietary protein. There is a high risk of recurrence
without preventative management regarding fluid intake and diet.
Ideally, a dietary history, metabolic screen, and stone analysis are
performed if facilities allow.

Glomerular disease

P.378

Glomerulonephritis (GN) is more common in the tropics than
temperate regions and the frequency of infection-associated GN is
higher.

Clinical features
GN may present with:
1. asymptomatic microscopic haematuria or frank haematuria.
2. proteinuria.
3. nephrotic syndrome.
4. acute nephritis (haematuria, proteinuria, oliguria).
5. acute renal failure (rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis).
6. chronic renal failure (CRF).
7. hypertension.
The glomerular response to injury is fairly restricted. Glomerular
appearances seen on microscopy may be idiopathic or secondary to
infection or auto-immune disease (see table opposite). >70% of all

glomerulonephritis is idiopathic. A careful search for possible
infections is important.

Diagnosis
Urine: proteinuria; dysmorphic RBCs (and RBC casts in proliferative
GN) on microscopy; albumin/creatinine or protein/creatinine ratios.
Blood: serum creatinine, albumin, lipid profile, U&E, FBC, ESR.
Serology: (to help determine the cause) ANA, dsDNA, complement C3
& C4 (immune disease); HBsAg, anti-DNAase B, ASOT, Hep C and HIV
antibody (infections); ANCA (vasculitis); anti-GBM Ab (Goodpasture's
disease).
Radiology: renal USS.
Renal biopsy: where available.

Management of GN
In many cases, GN resolves after treating the infection. In other cases,
depending on the aetiology, histology, and chronicity, GN may be
amenable to treatment. In a resource-poor setting, where histological
classification is unavailable, management is usually based on the
clinical syndrome.

General principles
salt restriction.
ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (check creatinine and
potassium 2/52 after starting and after each dose increase).
careful use of diuretics.
aim for a BP of <130/80 mmHg .
avoid further renal insults e.g. nephrotoxins, NSAIDS.

Specific treatment
Primary GN is usually treated with steroids and immunosuppression.

However, these carry significant risks, particularly in the tropics, and
require experienced supervision. In addition, effort must be made to
ensure that the patient does not have chronic infection (with e.g.
strongyloides, amoebiasis, viral hepatitis, or HIV) that might be
exacerbated by such treatment.

Nephrotic syndrome
The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria (>3 g/24 h or
albumin/creatinine ratio >300), hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, and
hypercholesterolaemia. Most cases of the nephrotic syndrome in the
tropics are idiopathic; some are secondary to:
infections, including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C.
diabetic nephropathy.
autoimmune diseases e.g. SLE, Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
neoplasia (especially lymphoma and carcinoma).
amyloid (leprosy, tuberculosis), sickle cell disease.

Clinical features
Facial and peripheral oedema with ascites and pleural effusions if
severe. Urine is frothy. Complications include:
Venous thromboembolism — renal vein thrombosis is a recognized
complication. Suspect it if there is sudden loss of renal function with
haematuria, esp. with back pain. Treat with anticoagulants.
Infection — especially pneumococcal peritonitis. Consider
prophylaxis with penicillin V 500 mg BD while oedematous; treat
infections.
Hypercholesterolaemia — treat in chronic cases.
Hypovolaemia and ARF — check postural BP, monitor urine output.

Management

Give an adequate protein diet.
Restrict salt intake.
Give diuretics to relieve oedema. Use cautiously since volume
depletion may be present (postural drop in BP, low urine output).
Monitor U&E and creatinine twice weekly and weigh daily.
Use ACE inhibitors to reduce proteinuria.
Treat hypercholesterolaemia with statins if chronic.
Consider prophylaxis with penicillin V during oedematous state (risk
of pneumococcal peritonitis).
Treat the cause in secondary GN. Use immunosuppression with
steroids ± 2nd line agents in primary GN depending on histology, with
cautions described above.

Minimal Change GN
Presents with nephrotic syndrome and is less common in children in
tropical areas. Treatment is with high dose steroids and the longterm prognosis is excellent although time to remission is slower in
adults and the rate of remission is lower.

Membranous GN
Common in children and adults in tropical areas. Up to 60% may
respond to six months treatment with steroids.

HIV-related Nephropathy
In tropical areas, this ranges from HIV associated nephropathy with
proteinuria to the nephrotic syndrome. The typical histological
lesion is a collapsing focal semental glomerulosclerosis. Other
lesions include HIV immune complex disease, membranous
nephropathy, mesangial hypercellularity, post infectious
glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy. Management comprises
generic treatment of GN (as for other causes of GN, in particular
ACE inhibitors) and commencement of HAART.

Hepatitis B associated glomerulonephritis
Occurs mainly in children who are carriers for hepatitis B. The
majority of affected patients are male and the age of onset is
between 2 and 12 years. The histological lesion is of a membranous
nephropathy. Most children go into spontaneous remission but adults
often progress to renal failure. The management is with
conservative measures in children but anti-viral treatment in
adults.

‘Quartan Malarial Nephropathy’
The previously suggested association between chronic P malariae
infection and nephrotic syndrome remains unsubstantiated.

Acute nephritis
Most often due to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in the tropics;
occurring 2-3 weeks after a beta haemolytic streptococcal throat, ear,
or skin infection (impetigo, infected scabies, or infected eczema).

Clinical features:
haematuria, oliguria, fluid retention (with mild oedema, elevated
JVP), hypertension, and variable uraemia. Complications include
hypertensive encephalopathy, pulmonary oedema, acute renal failure;
rarely, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and CRF.

Diagnosis:
haematuria, ± red cell casts, proteinuria, elevated blood urea and
creatinine, reduced creatinine clearance, and elevated anti-DNAase B,
ASOT. Culture throat and skin for streptococcus. CXR may show
pulmonary oedema.

Renal oedema
Oedema is often the presenting feature in both nephrotic syndrome
and acute nephritis. It can occur in ARF and CRF.

Nephrotic syndrome: the mechanism of oedema in the nephrotic
syndrome is unclear. It is due in part to glomerular damage → large
protein loss in urine → hypoalbuminaemia → reduction of colloid
osmotic pressure → oedema due to transudation of fluid from
capillaries to the extracellular fluid compartment → reduced
intravascular volume → activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system → 2° hyperaldosteronism with retention of salt
and water → increase in oedema. However, only 1/3 of patients are
hypovolaemic and the others are normovolaemic or hypervolaemic.
Acute nephritis: glomerular inflammation → reduction in glomerular
filtration → retention of sodium and water → increased
intravascular volume → increased hydrostatic pressure within
capillaries → oedema due to transudation of fluid into extra cellular
fluid compartment.
Renal failure: oedema occurs in acute or chronic renal failure due to
volume overload: Na+ and water intake exceeds the kidney's
capacity to excrete them due to the loss of glomerular filtration.
Other causes of generalized oedema: CCF, cirrhosis of the liver,
malnutrition, hypothyroidism, drugs (NSAIDs, calcium channel
blockers, oestrogens, and steroids), pregnancy, and idiopathic
oedema.

Management of acute nephritis
1. Restrict fluid intake, if oliguric, to 500 ml plus urine output over
past 24 h.
2. Restrict salt and potassium in diet.
3. Give diuretics (e.g. furosemide) IV or PO and antihypertensive
treatment (not β blockers which may precipitate pulmonary
oedema).
4. To eradicate residual streptococcal infection, give oral penicillin
V 500 mg qds for 10 days; or single dose of benzathine penicillin
900 mg IM; or if allergic to penicillin, erythromycin 250-500 mg
QDS.

Acute renal failure with pulmonary oedema

requires specialist treatment and/or dialysis. The prognosis is
usually good. Proteinuria and abnormal urinary sediment may
persist for up to 2 years — if it persists for longer, consider biopsy.

Acute renal failure (ARF)
ARF complicates many diseases in the tropics. Causes are roughly 60%
medical, 25% surgical, and 15% obstetric. If ARF is part of multipleorgan dysfunction, it carries a poor prognosis. The prognosis is better
when the ARF is isolated e.g. following snake bite or malaria.
Pre-renal ARF: ARF is 2° to hypoperfusion (dehydration, shock, blood
loss, hypotension, or septicaemia). Patient will be volume-deplete
and urine is concentrated. Requires careful fluid resuscitation.
Intrinsic renal disease: e.g. leptospirosis, falciparum malaria,
massive intravascular haemolysis from G6PD deficiency and
drugs/infections, snake bite, post streptococcal GN, rhabdomyolysis,
history of drugs, toxins, IV contrast.
Post-renal ARF (obstruction): distended bladder, palpable kidneys
(hydronephrosis), pelvic mass, large prostate. USS is diagnostic. A
urinary catheter will relieve lower tract obstruction.

Clinical features
Raised blood urea, creatinine, and potassium.
Oliguria (<500 ml/day) or anuria (occasionally non-oliguric). Patient
may be dehydrated or fluid overloaded depending on the underlying
cause.
Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, confusion, pericardial rub.
Acidosis — Kussmaul breathing or ‘air hunger’ (deep, sighing
breathing).
Bruising, GI bleeding due to uraemic platelet dysfunction.

Diagnosis

Examine urine: absence of a urinary sediment suggests a pre-renal
cause; proteinuria, red cells, and red cell casts suggest
glomerulonephritis.
Blood: urea, creatinine, electrolytes, ABG, FBC.
Radiology: US scan of kidneys to exclude obstruction; CXR for
pulmonary oedema.
Renal biopsy: if expertise available and cause unclear.

Course and progress:
most patients with ARF have acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The oliguria
lasts up to 6 weeks with rising urea and creatinine, followed by a
polyuric recovery phase. Careful management is required.

ARF in pregnancy:
common causes are post-abortion septicaemia, pre-eclampsia and
eclampsia, antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage, abruptio
placentae, and puerperal sepsis.

Management of acute renal failure
1. Examine the patient and assess volume status (JVP, skin turgor,
peripheral perfusion, mucous membranes, pulmonary crepitations,
peripheral oedema, heart rate, postural BP).
2. Optimize fluid balance. Give fluids if dry; if overloaded, see if there
is a response to diuretics.
3. Catheterize to exclude lower tract obstruction and monitor urine
output. Remove after 12 h if anuric. Arrange renal tract USS.
4. Consider urgent dialysis for pulmonary oedema, hyperkalaemia, and
acidosis.
5. Prevent GI bleeding e.g. with ranitidine 150 mg bd or PPI.
6. Record fluid input and output, daily weight, daily U&E.
7. Once fluid replete, limit fluids to 500 ml + previous days' losses.

8. Treat sepsis.
9. Avoid nephrotoxic or K+-sparing drugs; adjust doses of other drugs.
10. Start a low-potassium diet.
11. During the polyuric recovery phase, avoid dehydration and
hypokalaemia.

Management of complications of ARF
Pulmonary oedema:
sit upright, lower legs, give oxygen. Offload with nitrate infusion and
IV furosemide. If no response, urgent dialysis is needed for removal of
fluid. Consider removing 500 ml of blood as emergency measure before
dialysis, if very severe.

Hyperkalaemia:
serum K+ can rise rapidly in patients who are hypercatabolic and/or
acidotic. See opposite for management.

Metabolic acidosis:
if pH <7.1, cautiously give slow IV bicarbonate. Optimize hydration and
attempt to establish a urine output.

Management of hyperkalaemia
If ECG changes are present or potassium >6.5, protect the heart
with 10-20 ml of 10% calcium gluconate by slow IV injection with
ECG monitoring (this will not alter serum potassium). Repeat if
ECG changes persist.
Give soluble insulin 5-10 units with 50 ml of 50% glucose by IV
infusion over 15 minutes.
Give nebulized salbutamol 2.5 mg (salbutamol shifts K+
intracelluarly).
In refractory hyperkalaemia, particularly in the anuric patient,

dialysis is required.
Cation exchange resins (calcium resonium, polystyrene sulphate)
15 g qds PO or as enema increase faecal K+ excretion and are used
to prevent hyperkalaemia. Give with lactulose to prevent
constipation. Furosemide will increase potassium loss if the
patient is well-filled and passing urine.
Remember to stop medications that increase potassium and
consider dietary potassium intake.

Dialysis
Many countries are unable to offer chronic dialysis programmes.
However, short-term renal replacement therapy with either
peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis can be life-saving in acute renal
failure. There is evidence to suggest that haemodialysis improves
outcome in renal failure due to malaria or sepsis. However, this
requires specialist equipment and expertise and may be unavailable
outside large regional centres. Peritoneal dialysis may be more
affordable and requires less training.

Intermittent peritoneal dialysis (PD)
Instil 1-2 litres of dialysate over ~10 mins into the peritoneal cavity
via a peritoneal dialysis catheter. Keep the dialysate within the
peritoneal cavity for 30 mins before allowing it to drain out by
gravity over ~30 mins. Dialysate may be pre-prepared or formulated
locally.

Complications of dialysis
Infection, including access-related sepsis (line sepsis, PD peritonitis,
exit site infection), remains the most significant complication and
may be life-threatening. Additional complications include bleeding,
thrombosis, or air embolism in haemodialysis and catheter blockage
and fluid leaks in peritoneal dialysis.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

P.388

CKD results from progressive and irreversible loss of renal function.

Remarkably, kidneys have sufficient reserve to support life with as
little as 8% of their original nephrons functioning. Below this level,
patients develop uraemic symptoms — dialysis and/or transplantation
is then required for survival. The prevalence of CKD in tropical
countries is unknown but is likely to be higher than in temperate
countries. There is evidence of an increasing burden of CKD in tropical
countries.

Causes:
in tropical countries, glomerulonephritis, hypertension, and diabetic
nephropathy are major causes of chronic renal failure, as is
obstructive uropathy (e.g. chronic urinary schistosomiasis affecting
lower ends of ureters).

Clinical features
There are few symptoms of chronic renal failure until the GFR is
reduced to <20% when tiredness due to anaemia develops. There may
be fluid overload and hypertension. Uraemia may cause anorexia,
vomiting, hiccups, peripheral neuropathy, confusion, and drowsiness.

Biochemical features:
hyperkalaemia and acidosis are not marked until the GFR falls <20
ml/min. Exceptions to this are patients with tubulointerstitial
disorders. In most patients, salt and water balance is maintained until
the GFR falls <15% of normal, although this may occur earlier in
diabetes. Patients with glomerular disease and hypertension,
especially those with hypertensive heart disease, may retain salt and
water and develop heart failure.

Bone features:
increased blood levels of parathyroid hormone occur in very early
renal failure as the GFR falls <50-60 ml/min. This is probably due to
inappropriately low levels of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and not to
hyperphosphataemia with consequent hypocalcaemia, as previously
thought. With advanced renal failure, there is impaired renal synthesis

of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol from its precursor 25hydroxycholecalciferol. The consequences of this are renal
osteodystrophy. Vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia, and
hyperparathyroidism to the development of bone erosions and osteitis
fibrosa.

Anaemia:
Hb concentrations tend to be maintained until the GFR falls <30
ml/min, at which time anaemia occurs. There are many reasons for
CKD anaemia, especially the failing kidney's inability to produce
sufficient erythropoietin to drive bone marrow production of red blood
cells.

Diagnosis
Blood: urea & creatinine, electrolytes, Hb, FBC, Ca2+, PO4, urate,
glucose, ESR, serum proteins & electrophoresis (if myeloma
suspected).
Urine: analysis, microscopy, culture, 24-h collection for proteinuria
and creatinine clearance.
Imaging: AXR or USS (for renal size, obstruction).
Renal biopsy: especially in patients with normal-sized kidneys and
mild to moderate CRF, when the cause of CRF is unknown.

Pathophysiology of CKD
Glomerular hypertrophy resulting from nephron loss is
accompanied by glomerular hyperperfusion, hyperfiltration, and
hypertension. These in turn produce progressive glomerular
sclerosis, tubulointerstitial atrophy, and scarring.
Reducing intraglomerular pressures by good blood pressure
control, in particular with angiotensin blockade, slows down
progression of renal failure.

KDOQI classification of CKD

The estimated GFR using the MDRD equation is a much better
reflection of renal impairment then serum creatinine (see
p
364).
The KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) committee
has used the eGFR, in mL/min/1.73 m2 and derived from the MDRD
equation, to classify the stages of chronic kidney disease as follows.

Management of CKD
Treat the cause and reversible contributing
factors
Relieve obstruction.
Avoid nephrotoxic drugs; discontinue NSAIDs in patients with CKD.
Treat infections.

Prevent progression
Maintain good glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus.

Maintain blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg . Aim for 125/75
mmHg in patients with a urine albumin/creatinine ratio >100 or
proteinuria >1 g/24 h.
ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are
effective in slowing progression of renal failure and should be used
especially when there is proteinuria (see opposite).
Low-salt diet if oedematous/hypertensive; Low-potassium diet if
hyperkalaemia.

Referrals
Patients with microscopic haematuria as well as proteinuria and
renal impairment require urgent nephrology referral.
Patients with a rising creatinine over days or weeks should be
assumed to have ARF and referred urgently.
Arrange urgent ultrasound kidneys and bladder in patients with
urological symptoms.

Management of anaemia
Consider erythropoietin when Hb falls to <10.5. However, first,
exclude other causes of anaemia (e.g. deficiency of Fe, folate, B12);
investigate as appropriate. Fe supplements are frequently required.
A major side-effect of erythropoietin is hypertension; therefore,
regular monitoring of blood pressure is essential.

Management of bone disease
Start a calcium-containing phosphate binder when serum phosphate
is >1.6 mmol/L. To be taken with meals 2-3 times a day.
If serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) is greater than 2 times the
upper limit of normal, start alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg per day and
increase. Maintain PTH level between normal to 2 times normal.
Once a patient is on calcium supplements or alfacalcidol, monitor

calcium and phosphate 3-monthly and parathyroid hormone 6monthly.

Management of cardiovascular risk
Chronic kidney disease at least doubles the risk of cardiovascular
disease. Management of risk factors such as smoking, exercise, blood
pressure, and lipids should be strongly reinforced.
For cholesterol treatment, statins are generally safe but fibrates
should be avoided.

Starting angiotensin blockade
Check creatinine and potassium two weeks after starting an ACE
inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker and after any increase
in dose. There is usually a slight decline in GFR. Discontinue drugs
only if GFR drops by more than 20% and consider referral to
nephrology to exclude renal artery stenosis.
In patients with impairment of renal function who are on an ACE
inhibitor or ARB, do not use potassium-sparing diuretics
(spironolactone/amiloride) or NSAIDS because of the risk of
hyperkalaemia.
Treat hyperkalaemia (K+ 5.5-6.0) with furosemide and recheck in 2
weeks. Discontinue angiotensin blockade if K+ >=6.0 mmol/L.

Acute confusional state (ACS)
Clinical features:
clouding of consciousness is the most important sign. Patients also
have a short attention span and are easily distractable. They may be
disorientated in time and place. They often appear bewildered and
have impaired immediate recall and recent memory.

Check carefully
for signs of reduced consciousness, particularly drowsiness. This may
be a warning of impending coma (see
p 396). Psychiatric causes of
confusion (e.g. schizophrenia, paranoid state) and early dementia do
not present with drowsiness.

Delirium
This is more florid than ACS. It also manifests typically with
disorientation, confusion, and reduced attention but, in addition, the
patient is often frightened, irritable, and more profoundly

disorientated. The patient may have frightening hallucinations and/or
delusions, and exhibit aggressive behaviour.

Causes:
see box. Most common causes will vary with age.
Systemic infection: check chest, urinary tract, surgical wounds, IV
cannula sites, CSF.
Chronic subdural haematoma: may present with ACS.

Management
Treat cause if one can be recognized.
1. At night, turn the lights on to improve the patient's orientation.
2. Give 50 ml of 20% dextrose IV if hypoglycaemia is suspected.
3. Treat disturbed behaviour with chlorpromazine 25-50 mg IM/PO q6 h
or haloperidol 1.5-3 mg PO tds initially or 2-10 mg IM, repeated as
necessary q 4-8 h to a maximum daily dose of 18 mg.
4. Avoid benzodiazepines.
Nursing is very important in ACS — if possible, use a well-lit room with
familiar staff. Attempt to reassure the patient.

Dementia
Unlike confusional states and delirium, there is no disturbance of
consciousness in dementia. It is a chronic or progressive condition
characterized by impaired higher mental function (e.g. memory,
reasoning, comprehension) and emotional and behavioural changes.
Common causes are Alzheimer's disease and multiple strokes (vascular
dementia). Uncommon but treatable causes include communicating
hydrocephalus; vitamin B12 or B1 deficiency; hypothyroidism; syphilis;
cysticercosis; brain tumour; chronic subdural haematoma. HIV can
cause a dementia that is responsive to antiretroviral therapy.

Management:
Identify the few patients with treatable causes. Aim to supply others
with general support so that they may have the highest quality of life
possible. Remember that the family will also need support. Information
useful to Alzheimer's disease patients and their carers is available on
the web at www.alz.org

Common causes of acute confusion/delirium at
presentation (they may all progress to coma)
CNS infection (malaria; meningitis — including TB meningitis;
encephalitis; HIV-related infections).
Systemic infections.
Hypoxia.
Metabolic causes (e.g. hypoglycaemia, hyerglycaemia).
Alcohol — excess or withdrawal.
Drugs.
Head injury/concussion.
Stroke.
Mental illness such as schizophrenia.
Raised intracranial pressure.
Epilepsy (post-ictal).

Coma
A persistent pathological state of unconsciousness. In the comatose
patient, immediately ensure a clear airway, check that they are
breathing, establish haemodynamic stability, and check for lifethreatening injuries.

Take a history:
from relatives or bystanders — did anyone see how the patient became
unconscious? Is there any past medical history such as diabetes,

alcohol abuse, or drug overdose that might explain the coma?

Examine:
the patient in an attempt to distinguish metabolic causes of coma from
brainstem causes — see below. It is particularly important to identify
coma due to brainstem compression since surgical relief of the
enlarging mass may be urgently required. Use the Glasgow coma score
(GCS) — see below.

Useful clinical features
•

Fever

Meningitis or encephalitis
Cerebral malaria
Metabolic coma of infection

•

Hypothermia

Hypothyroidism; hypothermic coma

•

Hypertension

Coma may be due to stroke

•

Hypotension

Shock

•

Pallor, cyanosis

Metabolic disease

•

Bleeding, bruising

Head trauma

Progressive deterioration:
suggests brainstem compression. Look for focal CNS signs. Search for
asymmetry (e.g. in response to pain or in the face during expiration). If
the response to pain is different, the side with lower response in the
GCS is the side with hemiparesis.

Diagnosis
There are three broad categories.
1. Metabolic

Normal pupil responses.
Normal or absent eye movements depending on the depth of
coma.
Suppressed, Cheyne-Stokes, or ketotic respiration.
Symmetrical limb signs, usually hypotonic.
2. Intrinsic brainstem disease
From the outset there may be:
Abnormal pupil responses and eye movements.
Abnormal respiratory pattern.
Bilateral long tract and cranial nerve signs.
3. Extrinsic brainstem disease due to compression
Papilloedema and hemiparesis with progressive
Loss of pupillary responses.
Loss of eye movements.
Abnormal respiratory pattern.
Long tract signs.

Management of an unconscious patient

P.398

1. ABC: ensure adequate airway, oxygenation, and circulation.
2. Obtain a reliable history: check for signs of injury or trauma
especially to the head. Record the vital signs — temperature, pulse,
BP, respiratory rate, O2 saturations. Check capillary or venous blood
glucose.
3. Assess the level of coma: use the Glasgow coma score (see box).
Check for meningism, pupillary light reflex, corneal reflexes, fundi,
and focal neurological signs in the limbs. Do brainstem reflexes,
Doll's eye movements, and caloric tests if brain death is suspected.
4. Investigate: do the following — Hb, WCC, urea, electrolytes, glucose,

calcium, liver enzymes, and arterial gases. Also do blood cultures if
the patient is febrile, a malarial film if the patient is from an area
endemic for malaria, a toxicology screen if it is an overdose or
poisoning case, or a CSF examination if there is meningism (beware
rising intracranial pressure). Do ECG, EEG; X-ray the skull and chest;
CT/MRI the head if indicated and available.
5. Determine the cause and treat:
Coma with focal signs — e.g. subdural or extradural haematoma or
SOL may require definitive neurosurgical drainage and steroids,
mannitol, etc., to lower intracranial pressure.
Coma without focal signs — e.g. hypoglycaemia (give 50 ml of 20%
glucose IV); opiate poisoning (give IV naloxone); cerebral malaria
(give artemisinin derivatives if available or quinine); overdose
(give gastric lavage and/or appropriate antidote).
Coma and meningism — e.g. meningitis or subarachnoid
haemorrhage, treat with antibiotics.
6. Care: nurse in the ITU or high-dependency ward:
Monitor the level of consciousness using the GCS.
Determine pupillary size, equality, and response to light.
Check vital signs.
These should all be done at regular fixed intervals varying from every
15 mins to every 4 h depending on the clinical situation. Pay special
attention to respiration, circulation, skin, bladder, and bowels.

Prognosis:
depends mainly on the cause, depth, and duration of the coma. The
combination of the absence of the pupillary light reflex and corneal
and brainstem reflexes at 24 h indicates a grave prognosis. The
persistence of deep coma for greater than 72 h also has a poor
prognosis.

Glasgow coma score (GCS)

Assess on admission and then at regular intervals to follow progress
and predict prognosis.

Headache
The brain parenchyma is insensitive to pain. Headaches result from
distension, traction, or inflammation of the cerebral blood vessels and
dura mater. Pain is referred from the anterior and middle cranial
fossae to the forehead and eye via the trigeminal nerve, and from the
posterior fossa and upper cervical spine to the occiput and neck via
the upper three cervical nerves. Both infratentorial and supratentorial
masses can lead to frontal headaches by causing hydrocephalus.

Causes of a headache
Acute meningeal irritation: due to subarachnoid haemorrhage or
meningitis caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or metastases.
Rising intracranial pressure: see

p 402.

Many infectious diseases: cause a headache during the acute phase.
Locally important infections need to be determined (e.g. malaria;
meningitis — including TB; trypanosomiasis; typhoid, arboviral and
typhus fevers; fungal infections).
Giant-cell arteritis: may rapidly result in blindness. Occurs in elderly.
There may be a tender engorged occipital or temporal artery; ESR
markedly raised. Temporal artery biopsy may confirm the diagnosis,
but do not delay giving steroids while awaiting biopsy.
Migraine: headaches which occur at intervals (not daily) associated
with N&V, anorexia, photophobia, phonophobia, and in 20% of cases,
visual, mood, sensory, or motor disturbances. Most first attacks
occur while young. Identify and avoid precipitating factors; give
analgesia (paracetamol, NSAIDs, or codeine) plus metoclopramide 10
mg (not in children). Ergotamine useful in 50% of patients.
Chemoprophylaxis may work for regular migraines.
Tension headache: most common cause of headache. Normally a
benign symptom due to an identifiable cause (e.g. overwork, family
stress, lack of sleep, emotional crisis). It is often a daily occurrence
unlike migraine headache, getting worse as the day goes on. Visual
disturbances, vomiting, and photophobia do not occur. Management

involves thorough examination and reassurance of its benign course,
analgesia (usually paracetamol 1 g qds), and rest. Ask about drugs,
caffeine, and alcohol. Amitriptyline starting at 10 mg at night,
increasing by 10 mg each week up to 75 mg, is also often of benefit.
Tension headaches may be part of a depressive illness. Check for
other signs or symptoms such as mood change, loss of appetite,
weight, or libido, or a disturbed sleep pattern.
Analgesia-induced headache: follows long-term inappropriate use of
analgesia. History reveals increasing and frequent use of multiple
analgesics. Management: reassurance followed by stopping all forms
of analgesia. The headache initially worsens before improving.
Others:
Trauma.
Drugs.
Hypertension.
Cluster headaches.
Indomethacin-sensitive headaches.

Pain may be referred:
to the forehead and temple from the orbits, paranasal sinuses, teeth,
skull, or spine pathology, and venous sinuses.
The major responsibility of a physician faced with a patient with a
headache is to exclude a treatable, structural, or dynamic cause.
Specifically, exclude either a SOL or meningitis. Check for:
Localizing signs.
Papilloedema.
Neck stiffness.
Rash.

Raised intracranial pressure (↑ICP)

Clinical features
Include
Headache: often worse in the morning due to CO2 retention during
sleep → cerebrovascular dilatation, possibly waking the patient from
sleep; made worse by coughing, straining, standing up; relieved by
paracetamol in the early stages.
Alteration: in the level of consciousness (drowsiness).
Vomiting: (may relieve the headache; sometimes the 1st sign of
raised ICP).
Hypertension, bradycardia.
Failing vision and decreasing consciousness are ominous signs.
Papilloedema is frequently not present.

Pathophysiology
Initially, mechanisms such as reducing CSF volume allow the CNS to
compensate for rising ICP as may occur with a slow-growing tumour.
However, if the ICP continues to rise or if the increase is acute and the
compensatory mechanisms overwhelmed, the brain often becomes
laterally displaced and pushed towards the foramen magnum at the
base of the skull. The medial temporal lobe (or uncus) is then forced
down through the tentorial hiatus, or a cerebellar tonsil is forced
through the foramen magnum, causing the brainstem to become
compressed (coning). This produces the following progressive changes:
Level of consciousness decreases, drowsiness → coma.
Pupils become dilated and unresponsive, initially on the side of the
mass, then bilaterally.
Posture becomes decorticate, then decerebrate.
Slow deep breaths → Cheyne-Stokes breathing → apnoea.
Beware of ipsilateral hemiparesis and VI cranial nerve palsy as false
localizing signs (they may occur 2° ↑ ICP in the absence of focal

intra-cranial pathology).

Causes
SOL; cerebral oedema; hydrocephalus. The cerebral oedema may
surround a tumour or result from infection (cerebral malaria,
encephalitis), trauma, or hypoxic cell death.

Management
If possible, establish the cause with a CT/MRI scan.
1. Sit the patient up at ~30-40° to increase venous drainage from the
brain.
2. Ensure adequate oxygenation — ventilate if necessary.
3. Give mannitol 5 ml/kg of a 20% solution IV over 30-60 mins to reduce
cerebral oedema.
In severe oedema, dexamethasone 12-16 mg IV stat by slow IV
injection may also be used.
If less severe oedema, give dexamethasone 4 mg IM q6 h.
4. If the patient has a positive malaria blood film, see management of
cerebral malaria (
p 40).
5. Control seizures if present.
6. If a SOL is believed to be responsible, refer to a neurosurgeon. If the
ICP progresses rapidly, urgent decompression with burr holes may be
life-saving —see
p 430.

Acute pyogenic (bacterial) meningitis

P.404

A multitude of microbes — bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi — can
cause meningitis. However, bacterial meningitis is the most important
since it has a high fatality rate and is readily treatable. All febrile
patients with a history of headache should be examined for signs of
meningism.

Aetiology
In children and adults, bacterial meningitis is frequently due to:
Neisseria meningitidis (Gram -ve intracellular diplococci).
Haemophilus influenzae B (Hib) (Gram -ve rods).
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Gram +ve capsulated diplococci).
Meningococcus causes epidemics (see
p 406), while previous head
injury, sinusitis, otitis media, or pneumonia predispose to
pneumococcal meningitis. Hib meningitis is most common in children
<5 yrs. Other bacteria are less common (e.g. S. aureus, Pseudomonas
spp) or occur in particular groups or regions (e.g. Streptococcus suis in
S.E. Asia; Group B streptococci and E. coli in neonates; Listeria in
pregnant women, immunosuppressed, and neonates).

TB meningitis
is also an important cause of meningitis — see

p 146 and 408.

Clinical features
Headache, fever, N&V, photophobia, and stiff neck. Cardinal signs of
meningism are:
Neck stiffness — passively flex the head (chin towards chest); this
results in pain and resistance in a patient with meningism.
Kernig's sign — passively straighten the leg with hip flexed (>90°);
this causes pain and resistance by stretching inflamed nerve roots.
Neurological signs are not normally focal in pyogenic meningitis and
include: lethargy, delirium, coma, convulsions. Lower cranial nerve
palsies and retention of urine are common in TB meningitis. Acute
complications include raised ICP, seizures, sepsis, paralysis, SIADH.

Check the skin
(particularly on the back, buttocks, and soles of the feet) and

conjunctivae carefully for any abnormal skin colour and purpura. Cold
hands and feet and leg pains are also very early markers of
meningococcal septicaemia and should be recognized early as this can
be rapidly fatal. If present or if unsure treat for meningococcal
infection immediately.

Diagnosis
Take blood for culture, FBC, U&E, (and malarial parasites); lumbar
puncture (if no evidence of SOL or ↑ ICP) for CSF examination.

Prognosis
Mortality varies with age and organism. Perinatal, neonatal, and
childhood mortality varies from 50-80%. Similarly, mortality is
increased in old age. In adults, mortality with pneumococcus is 30-40%,
Haemophilus 20-30%, meningococcus 10-15% (much higher with
septicaemia). The main long-term complications include paralysis,
deafness, visual loss, epilepsy, and mental retardation.

Management
1. On suspicion, give immediate antibiotics — see below.
2. Give supportive measures: fluids, oxygen, maintain normal
electrolytes, generous pain relief, and tepid sponging to reduce
temperature.
3. IV dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg 12-hrly × 2 days is recommended for
adults and children with acute bacterial meningitis in developed
countries. However, two large studies from Malawi demonstrated no
benefit from steroids in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in
childhood or in adults. In Vietnam, in a similar study in adults, there
was a dramatic reduction in mortality with steroids. The difference
may lie in the rates of HIV, later presentation, and choice of
antibiotic. In HIV-coinfected patients not on anti-retroviral drugs,
there may be no benefit of steroids.
Initial empiric antibiotic regimens for presumed bacterial meningitis in
adults — choose one of:

Benzylpenicillin 2.4 g (4 mega units) IV q4 h for 10-14 days and/or
chloramphenicol 12.5-25 mg/kg or 1 g IV q6 h for 10 days.
Ceftriaxone 2-4 g IV daily in 1-2 divided doses.
Ampicillin 2 g IV every 4-6 h for 10 days.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Paediatric IV doses
Benzylpenicillin: neonate — 50 mg/kg bd (<7 days
old) or tds (7-28 days old); children >1 month old
— 50 mg/kg every 4-6 h (max 2.4 g q4 h).
Chloramphenicol: neonate <14 days old —12.5
mg/kg; children >14 days old — 12.5 mg 12.5-25
mg/kg qds.
Ceftriaxone: neonates — 20-50 mg/kg (avoid in
neonatal jaundice); children <50 kg — 50 mg/kg;
children >50 kg — adult dose.
Ampicillin: neonates 50 mg/kg bd (<7 days old) or
tds (7-21 days old), or qds (21-28 days old);
children >1 month old — 50 mg/kg 4-6 hourly
(max 2 g q4 h).
Local recommendations based on antibiotic sensitivity:
1.
2.
3.

Chloramphenicol
The WHO reaffirms the value of chloramphenicol in infections such
as meningitis and severe bacterial infections due to bacteria
resistance to other antibiotics.

Chloramphenicol has one serious toxicity — aplastic anaemia.
Estimates of frequency are 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 70,000 courses of
therapy (which are similar to estimates of death due to penicillin
anaphylaxis: 1 in 40,000 courses). The WHO's Expert Committee on
the Use of Essential Drugs, after due consideration of the risks and
benefits of chloramphenicol, concluded that it is essential for
modern medical practice in all countries.

Epidemic meningococcal disease
There are at least 9 different serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis
(meningococci), of which three — groups A, B, and C — cause outbreaks
of meningitis. Serogroup A meningococcus is the most important. It is
responsible for the explosive epidemics that continue to devastate
sub-Saharan Africa on an almost annual basis. It is also the main cause
of endemic meningitis in this area of Africa with rates that are higher
than the epidemic rates in other parts of the world. Types A and C
have both been responsible for large outbreaks in the rest of the
world.
Some strains of meningococci appear to be more virulent than others.
Large epidemics occur when such strains encounter populations of nonimmune individuals in areas of poverty during particular climatic
conditions (e.g. dry season, dust storm). In between epidemics, the
bacteria survive in the community in the nasopharynx of carriers.

Vaccination:
is essential for stopping an epidemic once it has begun. Kits for such
campaigns are available from the WHO. Advice on organizing a
campaign is also given in a WHO book — see below.

Chemoprophylaxis:
only for household contacts of cases: rifampicin 600 mg (10 mg/kg for a
child, 5 mg/kg for children <1 yr) PO bd for 2 days. (Alternative:
ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO as a single dose; child 2-5 years 125 mg; child
5-12 year 250 mg.)

Viral meningitis
Enteroviruses, such as ECHO and coxsackie viruses, are important
causes of epidemic viral meningitis worldwide, while arboviruses cause
sporadic disease in endemic regions. Other causes of sporadic viral
meningitis include polio, mumps virus, EB virus, HIV, varicella-zoster
virus, CMV, and HSV.
Clinical features are similar to bacterial meningitis but the headache
is less severe and the neck less stiff. It is diagnosed by examination of
CSF. The identity of the causative virus during epidemics may already
be clear. In sporadic cases, peripheral signs may suggest the aetiology
such as genital or rectal lesions (HSV), skin blisters (herpes zoster),
orchitis (mumps, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), rashes
(enterovirus), parotid swelling (mumps). The prognosis is usually good,
with complete resolution.

Other causes of meningitis
Mycobacteria — M. tuberculosis (

p 146 and 408).

Fungi — Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans.
Parasites — Naegleria fowleri.
For details on setting up a surveillance system and organizing the
logistics of a mass vaccination campaign, see the following book:
Control of epidemic meningococcal disease: WHO practical guidelines
(Edition Fondation Marcel Merieux, 1995). Available from the WHO.

Fig. 10.1 The meningitis belt of Africa. (Reproduced with
permission from Control of Epidemic Meningococcal disease: WHO
practical guidelines (2nd edition)).

Chronic meningitis
TB meningitis or Cryptococcus neoformans (also: disseminated fungal
infections; cysticercosis in children) typically present with a longer

history (>7 days), headache, and low-grade fever. Confusion and
drowsiness are common and may be due to hydrocephalus.
Papilloedema, visual symptoms, and specific nerve lesions (particularly
VI, VII, and urinary retention) may occur. Signs of infection at other
sites (e.g. lungs) may also be found. In patients who are co-infected
with HIV, the CSF cellular response in TB meningitis may be
neutrophilic and this can be confused with pyogenic meningitis.
Although often called chronic meningitis, these patients still represent
a medical emergency and delayed therapy can lead to a significantly
worse prognosis.

Diagnosis:
the cause can be determined by examination of CSF; subsequently
treat for the relevant infection. Both cryptococcal and TB meningitis
occur commonly in immunosuppressed patients, particularly AIDS, but
they also occur in previously healthy individuals.

Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis
Follows CNS infection with the nematodes Angiostrongylus cantonensis,
Gnathostoma spinigerum, or T solium (causing cysticercosis, see
p
440).

Angiostrongyliasis
— results from the ingestion of Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae in
infected snails or contaminated shrimps, fish, and vegetables that are
eaten raw or inadequately cooked. The larvae migrate to the brain,
where they induce an immune response to dead parasites, and then to
the eyes and lungs. Initial presentation is of acute, intermittent
intense headache without fever; malaise; N&V; cranial nerve palsies; ±
meningism. If severe, there may be fever, ↓ GCS, and spinal cord
involvement. The eyes are commonly involved. The role of
antihelminthics and steroids remains controversial. Dying parasites can
elicit a strong immune reaction that can be fatal. It is normally a selfresolving condition — give sedatives, analgesia; the headache responds
well to LP every 3-7 days. Treat with antihelminths (albendazole) and

steroids. Eye involvement requires surgery to remove the nematode.

Spinocerebral gnathostomiasis
is usually acquired by eating inadequately cooked, infected fish, or
shrimps, following which Gnathostoma spinigerum larvae migrate to
the CNS. It frequently presents with intensely painful radiculitis
followed by rapidly advancing myelitis → paraplegia with urinary
retention or quadriplegia, or as a cerebral haemorrhage in a previously
healthy person. Treatment is as for angiostrongyliasis with
antihelminthics (albendazole) and steroids.

Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM)

P.410

PAM is a rare but frequently fatal infection that follows intranasal
infection with Naegleria fowleri while swimming in warm fresh water.
The amoebae invade the CNS through the cribiform plate and cause
extensive tissue necrosis. Headache occurs first, then fever,
meningism, coma, convulsions. The patients are seriously ill. The CSF
shows neutrophils, red cells, and amoebae on wet microscopy. The
prognosis is poor. Acanthamoeba cause a similar syndrome,
granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), in immunosuppressed
individuals.

Management:
amphotericin B 1 mg/kg IV (it is usual to give a smaller test dose first).
Also, give amphotericin intrathecally (via a reservoir) — start with
0.025 mg, then increase to 0.25-1 mg (TOTAL, NOT per kg) on alternate
days.

Encephalitis
Virus infection of the brain parenchyma is termed encephalitis. It is
characterized by impairment of cerebral function, in contrast to
meningeal infection that does not involve actual brain tissue.
Epidemics of encephalitis occur seasonally in many parts of the world
and are important causes of death and disability in the young and
elderly. The equine encephalitides have recently caused widespread
epidemics in South America. Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSV) is
the most important cause of sporadic encephalitis worldwide since it is
treatable and, therefore, should be considered in all cases. However,
Japanese encephalitis far outstrips HSV in actual numbers.

Clinical features:
high fever, headache, N&V, followed by convulsions, confusion, and

changes in level of consciousness. Some patients also present with
meningism, focal neurological signs, abnormal behaviour, and/or
raised ICP. Severe cases result in prolonged coma, hemiparesis,
dystonia, decorticate or decerebrate posturing, and respiratory
failure. Neurological sequelae such as mental retardation,
hemiparesis, and behavioural abnormalities are particularly common
after Japanese encephalitis, untreated HSV encephalitis, and postinfectious/vaccination encephalomyelitis.

Diagnosis:
is via lumbar puncture. LP is contraindicated if there is evidence of
raised ICP or focal signs.

Management:
except for HSV encephalitis (see below), management is supportive
with careful control of seizures (using phenytoin) and pyrexia. Beware
respiratory failure and raised ICP (
p 402). The effectiveness of
corticosteroids in preventing cerebral oedema is unclear.

Post-infectious or post-vaccination
encephalomyelitis
On rare occasions, infection or vaccination elicits an antiviral immune
response that results in CNS immunopathology and an encephalitic
picture. It usually occurs after infection with measles, rubella, herpes
zoster, mumps, and influenza and after vaccination with the Semple
form of the rabies vaccine (but the relative risk is very small
compared with the benefits of vaccination).

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis
HSV encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
any patient presenting with an encephalitic picture. Focal signs relate
to the frontal and temporal cortices and limbic system. It is
particularly important since it is the only encephalitis for which there
is effective treatment.

Management:
aciclovir 10 mg/kg q8 h by slow IV infusion for 10-14 days. Untreated
HSV encephalitis has a mortality rate of 40-70% and many survivors
have neurological sequelae. Aciclovir markedly decreases mortality
and the incidence of sequelae.

Japanese encephalitis
A common arboviral encephalitis of E., S., and S.E. Asia. Historically, it
has been an infection of young children in wet season epidemics and
more common in rural areas. However, this is changing as the vector
adapts to an urban lifestyle. Widespread childhood vaccination
campaigns in some countries have reduced the incidence of clinical
disease. West Nile virus is a very closely related virus that causes
encephalitis in parts of Africa and Central Europe and has recently
spread to the USA.

Transmission:
is via the bite of Culex mosquitos (e.g. Culex tritaeniorhynchus). The
virus's primary hosts are birds such as herons, from which it is passed
to domestic pigs by mosquitoes. It is amplified in these pigs before
transmission to humans (a dead-end host). Most infections are
subclinical — ~1 in 300 infections results in encephalitis.

Clinical features:
after an incubation period of 6-16 days and a non-specific prodrome
illness lasting a couple of days, the sudden onset of fever is
accompanied by severe headache, meningism, N&V, and
hyperexcitability, or decreased consciousness. Seizures are common in
children. Neurological signs such as cranial nerve palsies, tremor and
ataxia, parkinsonism, and upper limb paralysis develop. Together with
a lowered consciousness level, they follow a variable course. Around
25% of patients die; many survivors have serious long-term
neuropsychiatric disabilities (e.g. parkinsonism, paralysis, mental
retardation). Spontaneous abortion and foetal death may occur in

pregnant women. Japanese encephalitis virus is now a recognized
cause of acute flaccid paralysis. Dengue (a related flavivirus) can also
cause an encephalopathic illness.

Equine encephalitides
Three alphaviruses — Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan equine
encephalitis viruses (EEVs) — cause widespread epizootics of
encephalitis in horses in the USA, Central America, and the northern
regions of S. America. The EEVs are not common causes of human
encephalitis, but VEEV has recently caused large epidemics in both
horses and humans in Colombia and Venezuela. The virus is amplified
during horse infections and may subsequently cause human
encephalitis.

Transmission:
rodents and birds are the primary hosts of these viruses; transmission
to humans is via Culex, Culiseta, and Aedes mosquitoes.

Clinical features:
most infections are subclinical. There may be a short febrile illness
with rigors (in VEEV also: sore throat, features of URTI, and diarrhoea).
In a few cases, the illness is biphasic: recovery from the febrile illness
is followed by encephalitis. Adults do not usually have sequelae; in
contrast, many young children and infants are left with permanent
neurological effects after encephalitis. Mortality is high (~10%) in this
group.

Nipah virus encephalitis
Nipah virus has caused an outbreak of encephalitis in Malaysia and
Singapore and appears to be endemic now in South Asia (Bangladesh).
The causative agent was a new paramyxovirus named Nipah, closely
related to the Hendra virus described in Australia, and potentially a
new genus. The Nipah virus is a zoonosis infecting pigs and fruit bats.
There is no specific treatment.

Rabies
A uniformly fatal illness, still common in many parts of the tropics,
that is caused by the rabies virus (or, very rarely, a related lyssavirus).
Once clinical symptoms have appeared, the patient will die. However,
if the infection is caught soon after transmission and before the onset
of clinical symptoms, rabies can be prevented by post-exposure
vaccination. Increasing availability and affordability of vaccines and
increasing their uptake by rural populations is pivotal in controlling
rabies.

Transmission:
is by the bite of an infected mammal, most commonly stray dogs (but
also wild dogs, wolves, foxes, cats, and skunks) in endemic regions.
The virus does not pass though intact skin; however, infected saliva
can infect already damaged skin (e.g. by dogs' claws) and mucosae.
Bites by vampire bats and inhalation of virus in bat-filled caves are
methods of transmission in central and south America.

Clinical features:
after an incubation period that normally lasts 20-90 days, prodromal
symptoms develop: itching, pain, or paraesthesia at the site of the
bite; followed by fever, chills, malaise, weakness, headache, and
neuropsychiatric symptoms. Furious or paralytic rabies develops
depending on the major locus of infection.
Furious (brain) rabies: the pathognomic feature is hydrophobia —
inspiratory muscle spasm (arched, extended back with arms thrown
up) ± laryngeal spasm, associated with terror. While initially
stimulated by attempts to drink water or wash, it soon becomes
provoked by many stimuli. It may end in convulsions with
cardiorespiratory arrest. Other features include: hyperaesthesia;
generalized arousal (lucid periods alternating with wild,
hallucinating, or aggressive periods); cranial nerve defects;
meningism; involuntary movements; autonomic nervous
system/hypothalamic changes — hypersalivation, lachrymation, ↑ or
↓ BP and temperature, SIADH, diabetes insipidus.

Paralytic (spine) rabies: prodromal symptoms are followed by flaccid
paralysis that ascends symmetrically or asymmetrically from the
bitten area, pain, fasciculation, sensory disturbances; paraplegia
and loss of sphincter control; ultimately, paralysis of muscles of
respiration and swallowing.

Complications include:
aspiration and bronchopneumonia; pneumonitis and myocarditis;
pneumothorax after inspiratory spasms; cardiac arrhythmias;
haematemesis; rarely ↑ ICP.

Diagnosis:
history of dog or bat bite plus neurological features;
immunofluorescence of viral antigen in base of hair roots in skin
biopsy; isolation of virus from body fluids during 1st week.

Prevention:
controlling the mammalian reservoir through vaccination; decreasing
human exposure to infected mammals; vaccination of persons at high
risk and those bitten by mammals (post-exposure vaccination,
p
416).

Management of rabies infection
There is currently no effective treatment for an individual with signs
and symptoms of rabies infection. In this situation, management is
symptomatic with sufficient analgesia and sedation to relieve pain and
terror. ITU care will prolong life by preventing or controlling
complications.

Post-exposure prophylaxis
Vaccination within days of exposure is 100% effective in preventing the
progression of the infection to encephalitis. However, the cheap
Semple vaccine that is used most widely in the developing world is
itself capable of initiating encephalitis. It is made by isolating virus
from infected sheep's brains. Unfortunately, an immune response to

sheep CNS components left in the vaccine can produce severe CNS
disease with a 3% mortality.
Recent efforts to make the safer, tissue culture-grown, human diploid
cell vaccine more affordable have involved using small doses
intradermally (ID). Studies with such regimens have shown that they
induce an immune response extremely quickly and that patients
require fewer clinic visits. The regimens have been found to be 100%
effective and without major side-effects.

Procedure:
see box
Clean the wound — this kills virus in superficial wounds. Scrub wound
with soap/detergent and wash under running water for >5 mins.
Liberally apply virucidal agent: 40-70% alcohol, or aqueous iodine.
Debride as required.
Give anti-tetanus toxoid.
Consider prophylactic antibiotics.
Give vaccine. The various regimens are below.
Give rabies immunoglobulin if possible, either human RIG 20IU/kg or
equine RIG 40IU/kg (in the latter case, have drugs already drawn up
to treat an anaphylactic reaction). Give half the dose IM and
infiltrate the remaining half around the wound.

Vaccine regimens for post-exposure prophylaxis
Sheep brain vaccine
(Semple) Give 2-5 ml vaccine SC into the abdominal wall daily for 1421 days. Boosters should be given after the course is finished.

Tissue culture vaccines
2-site intradermal method (2-2-2-0-1-1)
Days 0, 3, and 7: 0.1 or 0.2 ml ID at each of 2 sites (deltoids)

Days 28 and 90: 0.1 or 0.2 ml ID at 1 site (deltoid)
8-site intradermal method (8-0-4-0-1-1)
Day 0: 0.1 ml ID into 8 sites (2× deltoids, suprascapulum, lower
quadrant abdominal wall, thighs)
Day 7: 0.1 ml ID into 4 sites (2× deltoids, thighs)
Day 28: 0.1 ml ID into 1 site
Day 91: 0.1 ml ID into 1 site
ID regimens require the use of Mantoux-like syringes and must cause a
raised macule to appear immediately (like BCG vaccination).

Minor exposure
(including licks of broken skin, scratches, or abrasions without
bleeding)
Start vaccine immediately.
Stop treatment if the dog/mammal remains healthy for 10 days.
Stop treatment if dog's/mammal's brain proves negative for rabies
by appropriate investigation.

Major exposure
(including licks of mucosa and minor or major bites)
Immediate rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine.
Stop treatment if dog/mammal remains healthy for 10 days.
Stop treatment if dog's/mammal's brain proves negative for rabies
by appropriate investigation.

Fig. 10.3 Sites for the 8-site intradermal method of post-exposure
vaccination. The use of multiple sites ensures that as many groups
of lymph nodes are activated as possible, enhancing the immune
response.

Tetanus
Contamination of a wound with the bacterium Clostridium tetani can
result in severe neurological sequelae due to endotoxin production.
The toxin tracks back up the nerves innervating local muscles,
entering the CNS; it also enters the blood and passes to other muscles
where it is again transported back up peripheral nerves to the CNS.
There it blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, resulting in
widespread activation of both motor and autonomic nervous systems.
Muscles of the jaw, face, and head are involved first because of the
shorter axonal paths, but all muscle groups become involved in most
cases. Activation of opposing groups results in rigidity. Protracted
uncontrolled muscular spasms of the chest result in ineffective
breathing and hypoxia. Death is due to respiratory complications,
circulatory failure, or cardiac arrest.

Tetanus is easily prevented by vaccination:

its incidence worldwide is directly related to the prevalence of
immunization — where immunization rates are high, tetanus is a rare
disease; where immunization rates are low, it is a common condition,
particularly of neonates who become infected at birth. Immunization
of pregnant women prevents neonatal tetanus. Currently ~800,000
people die each year.

Transmission
C. tetani spores are ubiquitous in the environment and can infect even
the most trivial cuts, typically on feet, legs, hands, and feet. Neonatal
infection occurs via the cut umbilicus from the use of a dirty knife or
the practice of applying dung to the stump.

Clinical features
There is an incubation period of 7-10 days, but this is variable and
many patients cannot recall the injury. The period of onset (between
the first symptom and the onset of spasms) varies between 1 to 7 days
and is a good prognostic indicator: the shorter the interval, the more
severe the disease.
The first symptom is often trismus (due to stiffness of masseters
producing difficulty in opening the mouth). As the condition
progresses, other muscle groups become rigid, including muscles of the
face (producing characteristic look: risus sardonicus), skeleton (→
difficulty in breathing; opisthotonos; rigid limbs), and swallowing (→
aspiration).
Spasms are an exaggeration of the underlying rigidity and occur in
more severe disease either as a reflex response to stimuli (touch,
sounds, sights, emotions) or spontaneously. They may be mild and
brief, or prolonged and very painful. Prolonged thoracic spasms may
result in respiratory failure; laryngeal spasms in death from anoxia. In
severe disease, the patient has a fever, tachycardia, and an unstable
CVS, mostly due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system —
see box.

Neonatal cases

present with inability to suckle; they go on to develop characteristic
opisthotonos (see
p 28).

Diagnosis:
is be made on clinical features alone.

Prevention:
by active vaccination of children and pregnant women (
see also
Chapter 22); good wound toilet and passive vaccination following
injuries; and provision of clean facilities for childbirth.

Grading of tetanus severity
Grade I (mild): mild to moderate trismus; general spasticity; no
respiratory problems; no spasms; little or no dysphagia.
Grade II (moderate): moderate trismus; well-marked rigidity; mild
to moderate but short-lasting spasms; moderate respiratory
failure with tachypnoea >30-35/min; mild dysphagia.
Grade III (severe): severe trismus; generalized spasticity; reflex
and often spontaneous prolonged spasms; respiratory failure with
tachypnoea >40/min; apnoeic spells; severe dysphagia;
tachycardia >120/min.
Grade IV (very severe): features of grade III plus violent
autonomic disturbances involving the CVS. These include:
episodes of severe hypertension and tachycardia alternating with
relative hypotension and bradycardia; severe persistent
hypertension (diastolic >110 mmHg ); severe persistent
hypotension (systolic <90).

Complications
Respiratory: collapse; aspiration, lobar, or
bronchopneumonia (often due to Gram -ve
organisms); anoxia due to prolonged laryngeal

spasm; severe hypoxia and respiratory failure in
severe tetanus if patient is not paralysed and
ventilated; unexplained tachypnoea and respiratory
distress; ARDS. Complications also include those of
tracheostomy and prolonged ventilation.
CVS: (mostly mediated by ANS): persistent
tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension; labile
hypertension; severe peripheral vasoconstriction →
shock-like state. Autonomic storms are
characterized by sudden sinus tachycardia +
severe hypertension followed by sudden
bradycardia and hypotension; they may precede
cardiac arrest. Increased vagal tone is shown by
sudden bradycardia — sucking out of the trachea
may lead to an arrest. Dysrhythmias include: SVT;
junctional rhythms; atrial and ventricular ectopics;
short bursts of self-resolving VT. Hyperthermia
(hypothermia is very rare).
Sudden death: caused by many of the above
complications, massive PE, or unidentified event.
Sepsis: most commonly nosocomial.
Renal insufficiency.
Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture: occurs during
severe spasms; there are usually few sequelae and
healing occurs without incident.

Management of tetanus
Management of severe tetanus can be extremely difficult, particularly
in the open ward where conservative management has an appalling
mortality rate. Ideally, ALL patients should be treated in an ITU
setting.

However, careful management of the patient with particular attention
to critical care and ventilatory support can markedly improve the
prognosis where an ITU is not available.
If ventilators are limited, they should be kept for patients with:
Grade IV disease.
Grade III disease uncontrolled by sedatives.
Serious respiratory complications.

Give immediate care on admission
(see box). Subsequent management depends on the severity of the
condition.

Grade I
— beware complications of septic wound. Observe carefully since grade
I tetanus can progress to more severe disease. For sedation/muscle
relaxation, give diazepam 5 mg PO tds (neonatal dose 2 mg PO tds).
Alternative: chlorpromazine 50 mg (adult), 25 mg (child), or 12.5 mg
(neonate) IM qds (phenobarbital can be added if essential).

Grade II
— as for grade I but increase sedation/muscle relaxation. Increase dose
of diazepam up to 4-fold in adults (do not exceed 80-100 mg/day
because of respiratory depression). Give by slow IV infusion over 24 h.
The ideal sedative/muscle-relaxant schedule ensures continuous
sedation such that the patient can sleep but can be woken up to obey
commands. An objective guide is relaxation of abdominal muscles.
Perform a tracheostomy (may prevent death due to prolonged
laryngeal spasm and anoxia). If laryngeal spasm occurs, promptly give
chlorpromazine 50 mg IV (alternative: diazepam 10-20 mg IV).

Grade III
— treat as for grade II but also paralyse and ventilate. Reduce

diazepam dose to 30-40 mg over 24 h. Give pancuronium 2-4 mg
(poorer alternative: gallamine 20-40 mg) IV, titrated for each patient
to give sufficient neuromuscular blockade for efficient ventilation.
Initially, give every 1-1.5 h (1st 1-2 wks), then extend interval as the
patient improves. Check with periodic arterial blood analysis, if
available. Spasms still occur under paralysis but they need not affect
ventilation; pancuronium can be stopped when spasms cease. Continue
ventilation until patient can be weaned off.

Grade IV
— as above, with addition of drugs that act on the CVS if deemed
essential for grossly deranged haemodynamics.
Hypotension — give volume load; if ineffective or contraindicated,
use dopamine to keep systolic BP >100 mmHg .
Hypertension (systolic >200, diastolic >100 mmHg ) — propranolol 510 mg PO or nifedipine 5 mg sublingual.
Bradyarrhythmia or persistent tachyarrhythmias.

Overall aims of care
Maintain adequate arterial PaO2 and O2 saturation.
Maintain fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.
Maintain circulatory support in grade IV hypotensive patient.
A central venous line is very useful if available.

Management on admission
All patients should receive:
Antiserum (antitoxin) — preferably human tetanus
immunoglobulin 150 units/kg IM in multiple sites; otherwise
equine antiserum 10,000 units by slow IV injection, but be
prepared for an anaphylactic reaction in all patients receiving
equine antiserum and have treatment ready.
Antibiotics — metronidazole 500 mg IV q8 h for 7-10 days (poorer
alternative: benzylpenicillin 1.2 g IM or IV q8 h for 8 days).

Local infiltration of antiserum — is of uncertain efficacy but is
recommended in some parts of the world.
Magnesium — can help reduce the need for muscle relaxants and
sedatives and may be helpful in reducing autonomic dysfunction
and is safe at an intravenous loading dose of 40 mg/kg over 30
minutes, followed by intravenous infusion of 2 g/hour for patients
>45 kg and 1.5 g/hour for patients ≤45 kg.
Wound toilet — performed after other steps, to remove necrotic
tissue. Delay suturing.
Vaccination — before discharge.
Prevent, detect, and promptly treat any infection.
Detect early hyperpyrexia — treat with paracetamol and wet
cloths.

Critical care and nursing is essential
Reduce external stimuli — physical examination must be gentle.
Keep airway patent — use gentle suction to remove saliva and
secretions at the back of the throat.
Take exquisite care of the tracheostomy.
Gently and frequently change the patient's posture.
Use physiotherapy to keep lungs patent — give a small IV bolus of
diazepam before physiotherapy. In the paralysed patient, perform
physiotherapy when the action of pancuronium (gallamine) is at
its maximum.
Keep up patient's nutrition: 3500-4000 calories (including >100 g
protein) by NG tube is required each day.

Stroke
A rapidly developing focal loss of cerebral function which lasts more
than 24 h in a person with no history of recent head injury. In the
industrialized world, mostly due to cerebral infarction after a
thrombotic or embolic event (~80%). The situation may differ in the

developing world — see box. Around 20% of stroke patients die within
the first month; intracranial haemorrhages have a higher fatality rate
than those following cerebral infarction. The history of a sudden event
is crucial in establishing a diagnosis.

Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs)
— are defined as an acute loss of focal cerebral or monocular function
that lasts less than 24 h. They indicate that the person is at increased
risk of a stroke (~5%/yr) and death due to thromboembolic events such
as stroke or MI (~10%/yr).

Risk factors
Include hypertension (HT), ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation,
TIAs, peripheral vascular disease, DM, smoking.

Clinical features
The neurological deficits are varied but commonly come on rapidly. It
may be possible to relate the clinical features to the known anatomy
of particular cerebral blood vessels but collateral blood supply makes
this difficult. Infarcts affecting the cerebral hemisphere may cause
contralateral hemiparesis (→ upper motor neurone paralysis after
initial spinal shock), sensory loss, homonymous hemianopia, and/or
dysphasia. Infarcts affecting subcortical structures such as thalamus
and basal ganglia can cause mixed or isolated motor and/or sensory
defects or ataxia. Brainstem infarcts can have profound affects:
quadriplegia, visual and/or respiratory problems, locked-in syndrome.
There is often a transient hypertension that settles.

Management
It is essential to think about rehabilitation early in the patient's illness.
Do not ignore this issue until the patient has developed joint
contractures that will prevent physical recovery.
Give aspirin 150 mg daily if cerebral haemorrhage excluded.
Take great care of the airway in the unconscious patient. Turn the

patient often to avoid bedsores.
Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration.
Slowly and carefully lower BP if very high (>130 diastolic; >240
systolic).
If there is an identified source of thromboemboli (other than
endocarditis), anticoagulate as for a DVT.
Check for treatable causes such as giant-cell arteritis.
Watch out for causes of neurological deterioration — see box.
If there is evidence of cerebral oedema, consider giving mannitol.

Prevention
Recovery for most patients is rarely complete and primary prevention
is important. Reduce the risk of strokes by controlling risk factors,
particularly HT and smoking, in individuals and populations. In patients
who have had
TIAs or previous strokes, it is important to control HT and reduce the
chance of further thrombotic events by giving aspirin 75 mg PO od.
Assuming no contraindications, anticoagulation is required for patients
with AF, clotting disorders, or recurrent DVT.

Main causes of stroke in sub-Saharan Africa
Hypertension (haemorrhagic stroke).
Atherosclerosis (thrombotic stroke).
Rheumatic heart disease (embolic),
Others: Haemoglobinopathies (including sickle cell disease)
HIV
Subarachnoid haemorrhage
Unexplained (mainly young persons).

Causes of neurological deterioration after stroke
Local — extension of thrombus; recurrent embolism or

haemorrhage; haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct; posthaemorrhage vasoconstriction; further ischaemia; cerebral
oedema; brain shift and herniation; hydrocephalus; epileptic
seizures.
General — hypoxia (pneumonia, PE, cardiac failure); hypotension;
infection; dehydration; hyponatraemia; hypoglycaemia or
hyperglycaemia; drugs; depression.

Stroke rehabilitation
Without rehabilitation and physiotherapy, the patient risks spending
the rest of her/his days in a wheelchair or bedbound. It is essential to
start physiotherapy as soon as the patient is medically stable, to give
the best chance of regaining hand and arm function and of walking.
Aim to regain independence.
Rehabilitation is 24-h process. Good work during the day can be
ruined by a night in a bad position. It may be useful to teach the
patient's relatives the basics of physiotherapy so that they can both
look out for bad positioning and help the patient perform exercises.
Initially, encourage the patient to participate in therapy for about 20
mins, 3 times a day. This can be increased with time.
The patient needs regular turning to prevent bed sores (q4 h).
Physiotherapy should NEVER be painful. The expression ‘no pain, no
gain’ has no place in rehabilitation.

General guidelines
The stroke patient initially has decreased tone. At onset,
rehabilitation attempts to increase power in the limbs. However,
over time tone may increase so much that the limbs become spastic
with fixed deformities. A hand left bunched up and curled under the
arm is useless. Gentle repetitive exercises should be able to reduce
the tone. Work on the opposite movements to those that cause the
hand to bunch up: extension at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and
fingers.

Normal movement is easier if the person is completely relaxed. This
is accomplished by supporting the whole body as in Fig. 10.4.
The aim of stroke rehabilitation is for normal movement. Some
patients will neglect one side — ensure that the patient is able to
see both arms and hands at all times. Reinforce the message that
they are symmetrical. The patient can practise doing actions with
weak limbs (e.g. picking up a cup, stepping from one foot to the
other while sitting) by carefully noting the action with the normal
limb, and then copying this with the weak limb.
Repetition of a movement over a period reinforces plastic adaptation.
After a stroke, the brain has to relearn how to do things. It needs to
practise. However, repetition can strengthen both bad and good habits,
so it is essential to get the practised movements right.

Early stage
It is important to support and position the patient carefully, paying
particular attention to the hemiplegic shoulder to reduce the risk of
injury. Nos. 1-3 in Fig. 10.4 show how to cushion the patient.
Relatives or nurses should roll the patient carefully (no. 4). As
patient becomes stronger, teach rolling from side to side, and then
to get up from lying (nos. 5 and 6). The patient will often need help.
Frequent changes in position are good.
Aim to maintain muscle length (prevent contractures) with gentle
passive/active movements into extension, taking particular care over
the Achilles tendon, and the flexors of elbow, wrist, and fingers.

Fig. 10.4 Patient support and positioning in stroke rehabilitation
(continued p 427).

Encourage selective and controlled movements. It is better to work
slowly to get good control of arm and hand movements than to be
able rapidly to regain function with gross abnormal limb movements.

Basic principles for this early stage
Aim for symmetry — sit the patient in a good position with adequate
support. Set the arms forward. Sit the patient out for short periods if
trunk control is poor. This is important; practise transferring weight
from side to side — this will make it easier for him/her to shift
weight from one leg to the other while learning to walk again.
Aim for good control of movement — in particular, the patient needs
to be able to control the transference of body weight in sitting and
in standing. The patient needs to lean forward to get up. This is best
learned with a high seat initially (and something in front to help
build confidence). With progress, the seat can be lowered and the
front support shifted to the side, before trying a chair.
Aim for trunk control — in sitting, before trying to stand and, in
particular, during the act of moving from sitting to standing.
Aim for balance — in standing and stepping before walking.

Walking stage
Aim for normal gait — equal stride length and equal time on both
sides.
The patient may require support on one or both sides.
Start walking with the unaffected leg. This means that the patient
must have already learned to shift weight from leg to leg.
Walking aids — use a wheeled frame/rollator or a normal walking
stick (a quadruped stick should be a last resort).
The patient may require help with a ‘drop foot’.
Use mime, gestures, repeating and rephrasing movements, and
physical prompts to help the patient. Allow time for slow synapsing.

Little and often is a better way to build stamina and sustain carryover from one session to another.

Some ‘don'ts’ for stroke rehabilitation
Do not ask the patient to try harder — avoid effort as it increases
tone and gross patterns of movement.
Do not ask the patient to squeeze a ball — this encourages the arm
flexors that are already too strong.
Avoid a painful shoulder — do not make any arm movements unless
the whole shoulder, including the scapula, is relaxed and supple.
Support for a weak arm may be useful temporarily (e.g. while
concentrating on walking).
Never lift under the stroke arm or pull it — the muscles that hold the
shoulder are weak and the joint easily dislocated.
Prevent dislocation — support the forearm and hand forwards with
natural weight through the elbow.

Fig. 10.4 Patient support and positioning in stroke rehabilitation
(continued from p 425).

Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)
An acute bleed into the subarachnoid space that produces a sudden
intense headache, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
This is classically described as ‘like being hit on the back of the head’.
Most cases are caused by ruptured aneurysms. Other causes are rare
mycotic aneurysms (due to endocarditis) and arteriovenous
malformations (more frequent in young patients). 15% have no
identified cause.

Clinical features:
the conscious level may be impaired. The more severe the bleed, the
lower the conscious level, and the worse the prognosis. Other features
include: headache with meningism; vomiting; fits. Focal signs are rare.
The patient is often irritable and drowsy; the headache may last for
weeks. Complications include vascular spasm that contributes to
cerebral ischaemia.

Beware:
worsening conscious level, the appearance or worsening of a
neurological deficit (e.g. development of hemiparesis, dilatation of a
pupil), or systemic changes such as ↑BP that may indicate ↑ ICP.

Diagnosis:
is by clinical findings with LP (and early CT scan if available). The CSF
is uniformly blood-stained in the first few days. Xanthochromia (strawcoloured supernatant) may be present if at least 6 h have elapsed
since the onset of the bleed. It may be present for up to 14 days.
However, if meningitis forms part of the differential diagnosis, the LP

should not be delayed.

Management:
involves neurosurgery in many cases to evacuate an intracerebral
haematoma or clip the aneurysm. Medical treatment involves
extended bed rest, analgesia, sedation (beware masking of
deterioration in conscious level), and cautious control of hypertension.
IV hydration (3L/day) is strongly advised. Nimodipine (60 mg PO q4 h
for 2-3 weeks, starting within 4 days of haemorrhage) decreases the
incidence of vascular spasm.
Some SAH are preceded by minor herald bleeds that also elicit an
intense headache ± meningism or back pain. If suspected, refer for
evaluation since surgical treatment at this time may prevent a later
severe bleed. Rebleeding occurs in ~30% of cases; it is a common cause
of death.

Subdural haemorrhage
A slow venous bleed that follows damage to veins crossing from the
cortex to venous sinuses. May even occur after minor trauma in those
predisposed: elderly, alcoholics, people with clotting disorders,
epileptics. Presentation can occur months after the forgotten accident
as chronic bleeding slowly increases the size of the haematoma.

Clinical features:
typically there is a lucid interval between the injury and the onset of
neurological symptoms. Common acute symptoms include headache,
vomiting, fluctuating levels of consciousness; less often, mood
changes, irritability, incontinence, drowsiness. Signs may include
changes in pupil size, distal limb weakness, and increased reflexes; less
commonly, fits and dysphasia.

Management
This requires a neurosurgical opinion and, if possible, a CT scan —
evacuation through burr holes is recommended for most cases (Fig.

10.5). It is possible that minor haematomas will resolve spontaneously.
With appropriate management the outcome is good in all ages — ~90%
return to normal. It is therefore important to consider the diagnosis in
a confused elderly person.

Extradural haematoma
An arterial bleed that normally results from a skull fracture after head
injury (e.g. assault, road traffic accident). The haematoma enlarges
rapidly and, unless evacuated equally rapidly, there is a high risk of
brain herniation and the patient's death. Suspect when the conscious
level declines in a patient with head injury. Unilateral dilation of a
pupil, which is sluggish or unresponsive to light, is ipsilateral to the
side of the haemorrhage.

Management:
do a CT scan, if possible, to localize the expanding lesion. Further
management depends on the distance to a neurosurgeon. If close, give
mannitol before transferring the patient. If the neurosurgeon is
remote, a burr hole will be required to prevent brain herniation.
In this situation, unless a burr hole is done rapidly, the patient will die
or suffer brain damage. You and the patient have nothing to lose and
everything to gain. An inelegant burr hole now will do much more good
than an elegant operation one hour or more later.

How to do a burr hole
1. Incision
Shave the scalp if there is time.
Local anaesthetic is not usually necessary.
Make a 4 cm incision over the site of fracture or injury: this is
usually in the temporal region (just above the zygomatic arch),
where a curved incision is made (see Fig. 10.5 - 1, opposite) so
that it can be enlarged.

2. Incise right down to the bone.
Do not stop to control bleeding.

3. Scrape back the pericranium
(periosteum) using a periosteal elevator (or similar instrument) to
expose the skull.
Insert a mastoid retractor (Fig. 10.5 - 2) — this will stop all the
bleeding.
Leave the retractor in.

4. Perforate the bone using a perforator
(Fig. 10.5 - 3)
Dark blood will ooze out.
The dura will not be seen as it is stripped away by the blood clot.
Do no more than JUST perforate the skull.
This will create a conical hole.

5. Enlarge the perforation using a burr
(Fig. 10.5 - 4)
The burr will enlarge the hole so that it is nearly cylindrical.

6. The blood clot will immediately ooze out.
Suck the blood away by applying a sucker to the burr hole but DO
NOT INSERT SUCKER INTO THE CAVITY This will cause more
bleeding and might damage the brain.
It is now safe to transfer the patient to a neurosurgical unit.
Leave the scalp retractor in; organize for its return.
Leave in the endotracheal tube and leave a drip up.

Fig. 10.5 How to do a burr hole.

Blackouts
The most common causes of blackouts are epilepsy and syncope (see
box). A reliable eyewitness account is helpful.

Syncope
is the brief loss of consciousness due to an acute reduction in cerebral
blood flow. It is the most common cause of recurrent episodes of
disturbed consciousness and may be precipitated by anxiety or pain. It
is due to ↓ venous return to the heart leading to ↓ cardiac output, or
an inadequate response of the heart when ↑demand requires ↑cardiac
output. Causes include hypotension, vagal slowing of the heart,
neuropathy, dysrhythmias, aortic stenosis, vertebrobasilar ischaemia
(TIAs), carotidsinus syndrome.

Space-occupying lesions (SOL)
Classically present with focal neurological signs, ↑ ICP, or seizures.
Focal neurological signs can be used to localize the mass but beware
false localizing signs due to ↑ ICP rather than direct pressure from the
lesion (unilateral or bilateral sixth cranial nerve palsy most common;
also third and fourth cranial nerve palsies; uncal herniation may rarely
cause an ipsilateral hemiparesis and/or contralateral homonymous
hemianopia).

Causes
Infection — tuberculoma, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, bacterial or
amoebic brain abscess, paragonimiasis, schistosomiasis,
toxoplasmosis, fungal granulomata.
Tumour — glioma, meningioma, metastases, lymphoma, pituitary
adenoma, cysts.

Others — aneurysm, haematoma.

Hydrocephalus
In older children and adults, the skull will not expand if the
intracranial pressure rises. Blockage of CSF flow through the ventricles
or a failure to reabsorb CSF results in a build up of pressure or
hydrocephalus. While producing an increasing head circumference in
young children, it results in rising intracranial pressure in older persons
that will need urgent management. It exists in two forms:
Non-communicating hydrocephalus — due to blockage of CSF flow
through the ventricles, normally at foramina or aqueduct between
ventricles and/or basal cistern. Caused by any SOL, such as tumour
or cyst, or stenosis of the aqueduct. The location of the blockage
must be identified and the blockage removed surgically, or a shunt
placed.
Communicating hydrocephalus — due to CSF obstruction in basal
cisterns or subarachnoid space (the CSF still flows out of the
ventricular system but it cannot be reabsorbed in the arachnoid
villi). It may result from intracranial haemorrhage or meningitis
(acute pyogenic or chronic); the cause is often unknown. Presents
with a triad of
dementia, incontinence, and gait disturbance. (This condition is also
called normal pressure hydrocephalus). Repeated lumbar taps with
treatment of any underlying cause may be sufficient.

Causes of blackouts
Vasovagal syncope.
Hyperventilation.
Hypoglycaemia.
Epilepsy.
Hysteria.
Postural hypotension.
Cardiac arrhythmia.

Vertebro-basilar TIAs.
Hypoxia.
It is important to measure blood levels of:
Glucose.
K +.
Mg2+.
Na+.
Ca2+.

Epilepsy
Epilepsy is the continuing tendency to have seizures — spontaneous
paroxysmal discharges of neurons that result in clinical symptoms.
It is common, with around 40 million people affected worldwide. Its
incidence is higher in the developing world than the industrialized
world: approximately 1% of the population has epilepsy due to higher
incidence of infection and head injury. Unfortunately, at present only
~15% of cases are treated adequately and many people suffer
unnecessarily. There is a great need to both reduce its incidence in the
developing world (by decreasing the number of head injuries and
infections) and find ways of providing adequate supplies of affordable
effective antiepileptic drugs to poorer countries.

Causes
70% unknown, 30% known.
Infection — cysticercosis, tuberculoma, schistosomiasis,
paragonimiasis, sparganosis, hydatid disease, toxoplasmosis,
toxocariasis, cerebral malaria, cerebral amoebiasis, syphilitic
gumma, and HIV.
Epilepsy can also be a late consequence of almost any meningeal or
brain parenchyma infection.
Brain injury — due to either head injury (such as assault or RTA) or

antenatal head injury (may also be due to post-natal injury but this
is now believed to be less important).
Unknown — many may actually be due to very small areas of focal
dysgenesis (hamartomas).
Eclampsia — urgent delivery is required.
Inherited diseases.
Alcohol.
Brain tumour or metastasis.
Metabolic causes.
Degenerative disorders (in elderly).
Vascular disease.
Drugs.

Clinical features
Will depend on the class of seizure — see below.
There may be an aura or warning before the attack.
In grand mal attacks, the person has generalized convulsions usually
with tonic-clonic movements of all four limbs. The patient loses
consciousness and may bite his/her tongue and be incontinent of
urine or, rarely, faeces.
Post-ictally, there may be a period of confusion, drowsiness, a failure
to remember the onset, and a headache with a tendency to sleep.

Seizure classification
Important for choice of drug therapy. Origin and spread of the seizure:
A seizure that remains localized to its area of origin is a partial
seizure.
A seizure that subsequently spreads from this region to involve the
whole brain is termed a secondarily generalized seizure.

A seizure that originates in centrally positioned cells and activates
all parts of the brain simultaneously is a generalized seizure.

Principles of antiepileptic drug therapy
Establish a clear clinical diagnosis.
Get EEG supporting evidence if possible.
Choose a drug, considering the:
Seizure type(s).
Patient's age.
Price.
Interaction with other drugs.
Possibility of pregnancy.
Give one drug only.
Begin with modest dosage, building up slowly over 2-3 months.
Give full information to the patient concerning:
Names and alternative names of the drug supplied.
The main side-effects of the drug.
The need for compliance with instructions.
Possible interactions with other medications.
Monitor progress, seizure frequency, and side-effects.
Ensure adequate supplies.

Clinical features of the seizure
1. Partial seizures:
have signs and symptoms referable to a part of one hemisphere.
Simple (consciousness is not impaired, e.g. in focal motor seizures
which may start in a toe, finger, or the angle of mouth).
Complex (consciousness is impaired with signs of temporal lobe
activity, e.g. olfactory aura followed by automatism of facial

expression, behaviour, hallucinations).
Secondarily generalized.

2. Generalized seizures:
do not have any features that are referable to only one hemisphere.
Absences (petit mal) brief ~10 sec pauses (e.g. stops talking midsentence, carries on where left off). Classically, has pathognomic
3Hz activity on EEG.
Tonic-clonic (grand mal) sudden onset with loss of consciousness,
body stiffens for up to 1 min. before jerking, post-ictal drowsiness.
Myoclonic and akinetic seizures.

Management
If the seizure appears to have a focal onset, look for a treatable
underlying cause, particularly infectious (if available, use CT or,
better, MRI). Patients should be warned not to drive.

First-line drugs:
see a formulary for details of use and side-effects.
Phenobarbital — start at 1 mg/kg PO od, building up to 3.0 mg/kg
(max 180 mg) od. First choice for partial and generalized tonicclonic seizures. Should not be used to treat the seizures associated
with cerebral malaria. Its side-effects in children appear to be
acceptable.
Carbamazepine — start at 100 mg PO bd, building up to 600 mg bd if
tolerated. First choice for tonic-clonic seizures in association with
partial seizures; reserve drug for partial seizures alone.
Sodium valproate — start at 300 mg PO bd, building up to 750 mg bd
(max = 2.5 g/day). First choice for typical absences, myoclonic and
akinetic seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures in association with
typical absences.

Phenytoin — start at 2.5 mg/kg PO od, building up to 5.0(max
~8.0)mg/kg PO od. Reserve drug for tonic-clonic and partial seizures
(not for absences). It is a toxic drug and plasma levels should ideally
be monitored.
Other drugs — include clonazepam, ethosuximide, and the newer
expensive drugs (vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin).

Changing drugs:
Persist with an old drug until it has been used at its maximum dose
before considering a change. Introduce the new drug at its starting
dose and slowly increase to its mid-range; then start to slowly
decrease the dose of the old drug.

Stopping drugs:
It is not clear how long any person needs to stay on antiepileptic drugs
once the seizures have been controlled. An MRC trial of stopping
medication in people who had not had a seizure for 2 yrs showed that
59% of those who stopped medication were seizure-free at 2 yrs
compared to 78% who remained on medication. Discuss with the
patient what they want: risk of recurrence vs. gravity of the sideeffects.

Status epilepticus

P.438

Status epilepticus has recently been redefined: ‘generalized,
convulsive status epilepticus in adults and older children (>5 years old)
refers to at least 5 min of (a) continuous seizures or (b) two or more
discrete seizures’. This definition reflects the current uncertainty
about the relationship between the duration of convulsions and CNS
damage. Status epilepticus can result in death, permanent
neurological damage, or the onset of chronic epilepsy — risk factors for
such sequelae include aetiology, duration of attack, and systemic
complications.

Aetiology

~40% occur in known epileptics; other causes include fever or acute
CNS infection (particularly in children), head injury, pesticide
poisoning, stroke, eclampsia.

Management
Stop seizures quickly.
Prevent complications.
Find and control the underlying causes.
Remove patient from potential danger.
1. Secure the airway, preferably with Guedal airway, give oxygen.
2. Do not attempt to intubate if the jaw is clenched. Wait for sedation
to have its effect.
3. Give 50 ml 20% dextrose as IV bolus unless hypoglycaemia excluded.
4. Give thiamine 250 mg by slow IV infusion over 20 mins if the patient
alcoholic: note risk of anaphylaxis.
5. Give diazepam 10-20 mg in 2-4 ml IV or PR at a rate of 5 mg/min.
(For children, give 1 mg per year of age.) This should control ~80% of
patients. Second (and rarely third) doses may be needed.
6. Beware respiratory depression following bolus diazepam.

If convulsions continue after giving diazepam —
manage the patient in ICU if possible
Give phenytoin 10-15 mg/kg as an IV infusion, at <50 mg/min, through
a separate giving set. Once seizures are controlled, maintain with
phenytoin 100 mg PO or IV q6-8 h. (Alternatively, give phenobarbital 10
mg/kg as an IV infusion, at <100 mg/min. to a maximum of 1 g. Do not
give more diazepam. Beware respiratory depression and hypotension.
Chlormethiazole is an alternative. Phenobarbital is preferred for fits
associated with poisoning.). Check for and treat ↑ ICP.

If convulsions continue after phenytoin

1. Exclude pseudostatus.
2. Check drugs have been given correctly.
3. Then give general anaesthetic and ventilate, whilst treating
causative condition. Give thiopental 75-125 mg (3-5 ml of a 2.5%
solution) IV over 10-15 secs. Give further doses according to
response. Beware hypotension. If large amounts of thiopentone are
infused over a long period, it will accumulate and delay recovery.

Cysticercosis

P.440

This condition, caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, is a
common cause of epilepsy worldwide. Humans are the definitive host
for this species and normally become infected by eating cysts in
undercooked pork meat — see life cycle in Fig. 10.6.
Accidental human ingestion of eggs in faecally contaminated food
results in disease with marked morbidity of the CNS, muscles, skin, and
eye. The symptoms are caused by the inflammatory reaction to the
living and dying parasites (active disease) and long-term effects of the
inflammatory reaction to the cysts — fibrosis, calcification, and
granulation (inactive disease).

Transmission:
by ingestion of food or water contaminated with pig faeces. Poor
personal hygiene, particularly amongst food handlers, and faecal
pollution of water and irrigated vegetables predispose to infection.

Clinical features:
CNS involvement (neurocysticercosis) normally manifests as epilepsy.
However, since the number and localization of cysts vary greatly,
neurocysticercosis can manifest in a variety of ways including
hydrocephalus, dementia (frontal lobe involvement; often in children);
infarcts (due to vasculitis); basal meningitis; cranial nerve defects;
spinal symptoms.
Subcutaneous and muscular cysts occur in 25% of cases with CNS

involvement, but may also occur in isolation — the calcified cysts
appear as small, round, painless, firm nodules. The rare involvement
of cardiac muscle can result in conduction defects.
Ocular cysticercosis often presents with blurring of vision and the
sensation of something moving in the eye. If untreated, it may
progress to blindness and eye atrophy.

Diagnosis:
active CNS lesions can be identified by CT or MRI; calcified inactive
lesions can be seen on CT (and sometimes on X-ray). Serology.

Management
Patients should be treated with albendazole orally 15 mg/kg/day in
two doses for 8-30 days and with oral dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg/day
for 10 days. An alternative is prazaquantel either as a one-day
regimen of 25 mg/kg in 3 doses 2 h apart or a 15-day regimen using
50 mg/kg/day orally.
The one-day regimen should only be used for those with a single or
low cyst burden.
Surgery is usually reserved for subarachnoid and intraventricular
cysts causing compression and resulting in hydrocephalus or cord
compression.
Ocular infection should not be treated with drugs. Ocular cysts may
need to be treated surgically.

Prevention:
health education and public health measures to improve personal
hygiene, meat inspection, sanitation on farms, and sewage disposal.
Mass treatments in hyperendemic regions and interruption of the
parasite's life cycles.

Fig. 10.6 Life cycle of Taenia solium. Man (A) is the definitive
host, with a tapeworm 3-4 m long in the small intestine.
Proglottids (segments, B) of the tapeworm detach and are shed in
the faeces, each containing a branching uterus and thousands of
eggs (C). When human faecal matter is ingested by man or pig (D)
these eggs, which contain an embyo, develop into a larval stage
(the cysticercus, E) in muscles, brain, or other tissues. When man
ingests uncooked pork containing cysticerci, these evaginate (F) in
the human small intestine to form the head of the tapeworm; this
elongates and forms new segments, completing the life cycle.

Fig. 10.7 MRI of cysticercus in left fronto-pariental cortex of 35year-old woman who presented with focal seizures. A cystercus
was also visible under the skin of her left wrist. Both lesions
disappeared after 4 weeks of albendazole treatment.

Weak legs/paraplegia, non-traumatic
Ask the following questions
Was the onset gradual or sudden?
Is the tone spastic or flaccid?
Is there sensory loss, in particular a sensory level? — a strong clue to
spinal cord disease.
Is there any loss of sphincter control (bowels or bladder)?
Is there normal sensation around the sacrum and good anal tone?

Sudden weak legs with spasticity
Cord compression — spinal or paraspinal infection or abscess due to
TB, Brucella, pyogenic bacteria; tumours (metastases, Hodgkin's or
Burkitt's lymphoma, myeloma); disc prolapse; Paget's disease.

Cord compression — is an emergency. It must be considered when
there is a rapid progression of leg weakness and/or sphincter failure.
Check the perineal area for loss of sensation (saddle anaesthesia).
Other causes — infectious or post-infectious myelitis; cord infarction
(due to vasculitis, thrombosis of anterior spinal artery, trauma or
compression, dissection of aortic aneurysm, surgery); tetanus;
carcinomatous meningitis.

Sudden weak legs with flaccidity/acute flaccid
paralysis
Cauda equina compression — a neurosurgical emergency. Causes:
tumour; prolapsed disc; canal stenosis; TB; cysticercosis;
schistosomiasis.
Poliomyelitis — see

p 444.

Other causes — acute cord trauma/infarction; myelitis (in early
stages with back pain, fever, double incontinence, sensory loss at
defined level surmounted by a zone of hyperaesthesia); GuillainBarré syndrome; rabies; lumbosacral nerve lesion; hypokalaemic
periodic paralysis.

Chronic spastic paraparesis
Causes — cord compression (e.g. cervical spondylosis);
syringomyelia; tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP, due to HTLV-1);
MND; subacute combined degeneration of the cord (vitamin B12
deficiency); konzo; and lathyrism.

Chronic flaccid paraparesis
Causes — peripheral neuropathies; myopathies; nerve trauma; and
tabes dorsalis.

Weak legs + no sensory loss: motor neurone

disease (MND)
Absent knee jerks with extensor plantar
responses
Causes — Friederich's ataxia; taboparesis; MND; subacute combined
degeneration of the cord; DM.

Unilateral foot drop
Causes — DM; stroke; prolapsed disc; MND; organophosphorous
poisoning; common peroneal nerve palsy.

Principles of management of paraplegia
Prevention of pressure sores by turning every 2 h.
Attention to bladder and bowels (urinary catheter if incontinent).
Adequate hydration and nutrition.
Prevent complications: aspiration and pneumonia (ensure
adequate swallowing), DVT (support stockings/heparin),
contractures (physiotherapy), malaria (mosquito net).
Treat the underlying cause.

Poliomyelitis
This disease, usually of young children, is caused by the poliovirus, an
enterovirus. The virus selectively infects and destroys anterior horn
cells in the spinal cord, resulting in the cardinal sign of polio — acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP). The clinical disease is relatively uncommon,
however (~99% of infected people show no paralytic manifestations).
A worldwide vaccination effort is under way to eradicate it. Whilst
polio has been a major cause of disability worldwide, it may soon be
just a memory.

Transmission:

via ingestion of faecally contaminated food or water, or via droplet
spread from the respiratory tract.

Clinical features:
the prodromal symptoms are common to many infections and
practically indistinguishable: fever, malaise, headache, drowsiness,
sore throat.
In a minority, CNS disease (preparalytic disease) follows with abrupt
onset of fever, headache, body pains, sensory disturbances, and neck
stiffness — due to poliovirus meningitis. Flaccid paralysis then occurs
in ~65%, developing asymmetrically over a variable time, particularly
affecting the lower limbs. The paralysis rarely progresses after 3 days
or after the temperature falls. There is some recovery of function over
the following weeks or months, as some damaged anterior horn cells
recover. Death is relatively uncommon but results from aspiration or
airway obstruction (bulbar paralysis) or respiratory failure (respiratory
paralysis). A rare complication is slow deterioration of limb or bulbar
function after many years — the post-polio syndrome.

Diagnosis:
is clinical, with retrospective serological analysis.

Management:
is supportive. Bed rest is essential; give analgesia, sedation. Avoid
injections (see box).

Prevention:
vaccination and improved public health.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)
A post-infectious demyelinating peripheral polyneuropathy. Some form
of infection, mainly respiratory or diarrhoea, precedes the onset of
GBS by 1-2 weeks in ~60% of cases. It develops over a few hours

(rarely), to several weeks, and is a medical emergency. Respiratory
arrest may occur without notice in severe cases; sudden death may
also be caused by ANS disturbance of cardiovascular function. These
patients need constant observation, in an ITU setting if possible.

Clinical features:
include progressive muscle weakness in the limbs of less than 4 wks'
duration; distal paraesthesia (less often sensory loss). Back and limb
pain may be occasionally present. Also cranial nerve palsies
(particularly VII); disturbances; ileus. Monitor respiratory function and
heart rhythm; plasma exchange or high-dose immunoglobulin, if
available, shortens the hospital stay. Recovery occurs over several
weeks or months with remyelination of peripheral nerves.

Warnings
Paralytic poliomyelitis is made worse by IM injections during the
preparalytic phase (e.g. injections of antibiotics) or by the muscles
becoming fatigued (e.g. after exercise), so a high index of suspicion
in endemic regions is important to prevent polio being made worse.
Patients must be carefully observed during the onset of paralysis for
signs of life-threatening bulbar and respiratory paralysis. Nurse
patients with weak swallowing on their side. Good nursing care,
including frequent suction and observations, may delay the need for
a tracheostomy — however, perform a tracheostomy early in serious
cases.

Polio rehabilitation
Acute stage
Treatment at this stage is based on: (i) rest (ii) positioning.
Support the wrist and hands in a functional position with a splint
or other support (e.g. pillow).
Support the ankle — maintain the ankle at 90° and avoid
excessive inversion or eversion.

Subacute stage

Progress from passive movements to active assisted movements,
to active movements within the normal range. The movements
will depend on the muscle groups affected.
Progress to standing and walking with assistance — use walking
aids if necessary (e.g. stick, crutches). Aim for the best possible
function.

Avoid
Muscle shortening.
Malformation due to muscle imbalance.

Mono/polyneuropathies
The mononeuropathies are lesions of single nerves; polyneuropathies
are lesions of multiple nerves normally due to systemic disease. In
some conditions such as leprosy, multiple peripheral nerves may be
involved simultaneously — this is termed ‘mononeuritis multiplex’.
Polyneuropathies are symmetrical conditions and often affect the
peripheries initially, producing a symmetrical glove and stocking
distribution. In the tropics, environmental toxins and nutritional
deficiencies are important causes of peripheral neuropathies. They
may be seen in epidemic form after toxins are released into the
environment by industry or in an endemic form in particular regions.
Some toxins are used in local forms of medicine or they may
contaminate food, liquor, etc. They frequently produce an individually
recognizable syndrome. As always, there is no replacement for local
clinical experience. In these situations, treatment involves removal of
the toxin and/or supplementation with the deficient nutrient. The
effects of many neuropathies are permanent.

Causes
Single nerves can be damaged by:
Trauma.
Compression.

Diabetes mellitus.
Leprosy.
The latter two conditions will often develop into neuropathies
affecting multiple nerves, causing a mononeuritis multiplex or
widespread peripheral neuropathy.

Polyneuropathies can be caused by
1. Deficiencies: vitamin B1, B6, and B12; plus a variety of multiple
nutrient deficiencies.
2. Toxins
Heavy metals: including lead (motor involvement), thallium
(found in rodenticides → alopecia), arsenic (Mee's nail lines,
changes in skin pigmentation, skin cancers).
Drugs: many but particularly isoniazid, ethambutol (affects optic
nerve), sulfonamides, chloroquine, clioquinol, metronidazole,
phenytoin, didanosine, stavudine.
Industrial chemicals/solvents (e.g. trio-ortho-cresyl phosphate).
Pesticides, particularly organophosphorous (OP) compounds.
Excessive consumption of certain foods (e.g. cassava containing a
cyanogenic glycoside) can cause tropical ataxic neuropathy.
3. Metabolic diseases: DM, renal or liver failure, alcohol,
hypothyroidism.
4. Infections: leprosy, HIV.
5. Other causes: genetic diseases, malignancy, connective tissue
disease.

Leprosy (Hansen's disease)
Leprosy is a disease that still elicits immense stigma in many
communities. It is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by
Mycobacterium leprae infecting macrophages and peripheral nerve
Schwann cells.
Its presentation and progress are determined by the patient's cellmediated immune response to the mycobacterium. Most people (~95%)
develop an effective immune response and clear M. leprae. A minority
are unable to do so and develop clinical leprosy. The clinical features
form a spectrum determined by the immune response (see box). The
two poles of the spectrum are tuberculoid (TT; paucibacillary) and
lepromatous leprosy (LL; multibacillary). At the TT pole there is a
strong (but ineffective) immune response to the bacteria which
damages peripheral nerves and skin. At the LL pole, there is cellular
anergy towards M. leprae with abundant bacillary multiplication.
Between these two poles are the borderline patients — borderline
tuberculoid (BT), borderline (BB), borderline lepromatous (BL) — with
varying immunity and bacterial loads. The polar groups (TT, LL) are
stable, but the borderline groups are unstable and experience tissuedamaging reactions.

Transmission:
Untreated lepromatous patients discharge bacilli from the nose.
Infection occurs when M. leprae invades via the nasal mucosa with
haematogenous spread to skin and nerve. Leprosy bacilli can survive

for several days in the environment. People in close contact with
infected people have a greater, but still small, chance of becoming
infected. The incubation period is 2-5 yrs for TT cases and 8-12 yrs for
LL cases. HIV infection does not appear a risk factor for the
development of leprosy.

Clinical features
Skin: the most common lesions are macules or plaques; more rarely
papules and nodules or diffuse infiltration. Indeterminate leprosy is
an early form of disease often found in screening programmes;
lesions can last for months before resolving or progressing to
established leprosy.
Nerve damage: occurs in peripheral nerve trunks — great auricular
nerve (neck), ulnar nerve (elbow), radial-cutaneous nerve (wrist),
median nerve (wrist), lateral popliteal nerve (neck of the fibula),
and posterior tibial nerve (medial malleolus) — producing typical
patterns of regional sensory and motor loss. Small dermal nerves are
also involved producing patches of anaesthesia in TT/BT lesions and
glove and stocking sensory loss in LL patients.
Other organs: may be involved: eyes (can → blindness); bones
(dactylitis, resorption); testes (orchititis, sterility); nasopharynx
(nasal collapse).

Presentation of leprosy
Patients commonly present with skin lesions, weakness, or
numbness due to peripheral nerve lesion or a burn/ulcer in an
anaesthetic hand or foot.
Borderline patients may present in reaction with nerve pain,
sudden palsy, multiple new skin lesions, pain in the eye, or
systemic febrile illness.
The ulceration and digit loss seen in leprosy is due to secondary
damage in neuropathic hands and feet and is not an intrinsic
disease feature.

As above

Diagnosis
is based on:
A typical skin lesion (loss of sensation in TT/BT patients).
Thickened peripheral nerves.
Skin smear from lesion edge/ear lobe positive for mycobacteria. Test
skin lesions for sensation. Palpate peripheral nerves to assess
enlargement/tenderness. Assess nerve function by testing the small
muscles' power and sensation in hands/feet. Many patients are
unaware of their anaesthesia. Eye function should be checked (visual
acuity, corneal sensation, and eyelid closure). Serology is not
helpful.

Management
1. Chemotherapy to treat the infection
The WHO regimens are given in Table 10.4 below. More than 11
million people have been treated with such multi-drug regimens.
Relapse rates are 0.1%/yr. Clinical improvement is rapid and adverse
reactions are rare. These drugs are considered safe during pregnancy

and breastfeeding. Patients are classified for treatment by the
number of skin lesions present, paucibacillary have 2-5;
multibacillary >5.

2. Educate the patient about leprosy
Within 72 h of starting chemotherapy, they are non-infectious. They
can lead a normal social life. There are no limitations on touching,
sex, sharing utensils. Leprosy is not a curse from God or a
punishment. Gross deformities are not the inevitable endpoint of
disease. Care and awareness of their limbs are as important as
chemotherapy.
3. Prevent disability
Monitor sensation and muscle power in patient's hands, feet, and
eyes as part of routine follow-up so that new nerve damage is

detected early. Treat any new damage with prednisolone 40 mg
daily, reducing by 5 mg/day each month.
Patient self-awareness is crucial in minimizing damage. Patients with
anaesthetic hands or feet need to inspect hands and feet (using a
mirror) daily for injuries or infection and dress wounds immediately.
Protect hands and feet from trauma (‘trainers’ are excellent for
anaesthetic feet). Identify the cause of any injury so that it can be
avoided. Soak dry hands and feet in water and then rub with oil to
keep skin moist.
4. Support the patient socially and psychologically.

Reactions
Immune-medicated, tissue-damaging phenomena that may occur
before, during, or after treatment. They should be treated promptly
to prevent serious nerve damage. Do not stop chemotherapy during
a reaction.

Reversal reaction (type 1 reaction):
is due to delayed type hypersensitivity and occurs in patients with
borderline leprosy, affecting up to 30% of BL patients. Skin lesions
become erythematous; peripheral nerves become tender and
painful. Loss of nerve function can be sudden, with foot-drop
occurring overnight. Neuritis may occur without skin lesions or in a
clinically silent form without nerve tenderness.

Management:
for severe reactions, prednisolone 40-60 mg PO od reduced every 2-4
wks over 20 wks. A few patients may require 15-20 mg prednisolone
daily for many months. Response rates vary depending on the
severity of initial damage but even promptly treated nerve damage
will only improve in 60% cases.

Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (type 2 reaction):
due to immune complex deposition and occurs in 20% LL and 5% BL
patients. It manifests with malaise, fever, and crops of painful red
nodules that become purple and then resolve. If severe, plaques
may form with necrosis and ulceration. Iritis common; other signs

are bone pain and swollen joints, painful neuritis, lymphadenopathy,
iridocyclitis, orchitis, nephritis (rarely).

Management:
in moderate and severe cases (systemic features or painful nerves),
treat in hospital with one of:
Prednisolone 60-80 mg PO od, reduced after 2 wks by 5-10 mg
every 2 wks (best for short episodes).
Thalidomide 400 mg nightly for 4 wks. Once a satisfactory
response, reduce by 50 mg every 2-4 wks (best drug but
contraindicated in women of childbearing age and often not
available). Causes drowsiness.
Clofazimine 300 mg daily, reduced after 3 months (preferred drug
for premenopausal women; takes 3-4 wks to have full effect so
should be combined with prednisolone initially). Causes brown
skin staining.
Treat iridocyclitis with steroid and homatropine eye drops.
ENL is difficult to treat: some patients develop a chronic relapsing
form which may last for up to 5 yrs, but will then resolve.

Ulcers
Ulcers in anaesthetic feet are the most common cause of
hospitalization. Ulceration is treated by rest and cleaning. Ulcers
should be carefully probed to detect osteomyelitis and sinuses that
require surgical debridement. Unlike ulcers in diabetic or ischaemic
feet, ulcers in leprosy heal if they are protected from weightbearing. No weight-bearing is permitted until ulcer heals.
Appropriate footwear to prevent recurrence.

Anaemia
Anaemia is one of the most common medical conditions; prevalence
often reaches 70% in children and pregnant women in developing
countries. Anaemia is present when the haemoglobin (Hb) falls below
the reference level for the age and sex of the individual (see box). A
slight drop in Hb is a physiological response to pregnancy, due to an ↑
in the plasma: red cell ratio. Anaemia in pregnancy is associated with
25-40% of maternal deaths.

Causes of anaemia
Anaemia is due to ↓ red blood cell (RBC) production or ↑ RBC
loss/haemolysis (see Tables 11.1 and 11.2); >1 cause may be present in
an individual. The blood film morphology, degree of reticulocytosis,
and the size of red blood cells (i.e. mean cell volume — MCV,
measured by an automated machine) is helpful in determining the
cause (see box p 459).
The MCV is influenced by the cause of the anaemia, age of the patient,
and the number of reticulocytes (these have a higher MCV than older
erythrocytes).

Reticulocyte count is usually ↑ in RBC loss (unless the patient has
insufficient stores of iron and/or folate to mount a reticulocyte
response) and is ↓ if rbc production is impaired. An indication of the
degree of reticulocytosis is given by the degree of polychromasia seen
on blood film examination, as these younger cells appear ‘bluer’ than
older erythrocytes. For an accurate reticulocyte count, special stains
are required.

Clinical features of anaemia
History
Symptoms of anaemia depend on the rapidity of onset and severity.
Chronic anaemia may be asymptomatic because of a compensatory ↑
in cardiac output. Symptoms are usually non-specific: fatigue,
headache, dizziness, syncope, dyspnoea, palpitations, reduced work or
intellectual capacity. Anaemia may also exacerbate pre-existing
intermittent claudication or angina.
The history is important in determining the cause(s) of anaemia: a past
and family history of anaemia suggests an inherited disorder, such as
haemoglobinopathy or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency. Haemolysis may be suggested by splenomegaly, jaundice,
and dark urine and may be precipitated by infections. Sources of blood
loss can be revealed from questions about bowel habit and colour of
stools, haematuria, and menstrual history. Ask about recent surgery,
childbirth, or trauma. The occupation of the patient may be important
e.g. fishermen may be prone to schistosomiasis and farmers to
hookworm infection. Poor diet may suggest a nutritional deficiency.
Chronic infections such as HIV and TB, renal failure, rheumatoid
arthritis, and some drugs used to treat these conditions, may be
associated with anaemia.

Examination
Clinical assessment is routinely carried out, but has low sensitivity and
specificity for mild — moderate anaemia. Signs include pallor of
mucous membranes or nail beds (sensitivity 50-70% for moderate to
severe anaemia) and signs of a compensatory hyperdynamic circulation
(tachycardia, bounding pulse, cardiomegaly, systolic flow murmur).
Severe, decompensated anaemia leads to shock (i.e. thirst, sweating,

cold extremities, hypotension, and cardiac failure) — these signs
require urgent fluid replacement or, as a last resort, blood transfusion.

Laboratory diagnosis of anaemia
Measure the Hb concentration or packed cell volume (PCV or
haematocrit) of venous or capillary blood. For capillary samples from a
finger or heel prick, the first few drops of blood should be wiped away
to encourage free flow. Avoid squeezing — tissue fluid causes dilution.

Assays
Hb can be measured photometrically (e.g. the haemoglobin-cyanide
technique) in which lysed whole blood reacts with a cyanide solution
to form haemiglobincyanide. Cyanide is hazardous and the method
requires laboratory equipment and skill to produce accurate
dilutions.
The HemoCue Hb301 system is portable, battery-operated and
designed for accurate measurement of Hb in tropical conditions. No
dilution is required — it uses whole blood and is simple and rapid.
The WHO haemoglobin colour scale can be used where no power or
equipment is available and an approximate haemoglobin estimation
is adequate. The colour of a drop of blood on chromatography paper
is matched against a colour scale representing blood of Hb in 2 g/dl
increments (range 4-14 g/dl). The test is simple and cheap, but the
correct paper must be used and it must be read in good light
conditions. Other simple techniques such as the Sahli or Talqvist
methods have been shown to be unreliable in field situations.
Measurement of PCV requires a microhaematocrit centrifuge and
electricity but can be carried out by non-technical staff. Blood is
taken up into capillary tubes directly from a finger prick and
centrifuged for 5 min. This separates cells and plasma and the ratio
of the length of red cell column to the total length of the blood
sample gives the haematocrit.

Iron-deficiency anaemia
This is the most common cause of anaemia worldwide.

Causes of iron deficiency
↑ losses: menstrual, gastrointestinal infections (e.g. hookworm,
whipworm, amoebiasis), peptic ulceration, carcinoma, oesophageal
varices, haemoptysis, haematuria.
↑ requirements: lactation, puberty, infancy.
↓ intake: ingestion of only milk (human or cow's) beyond 6 mths of
age; lack of red meat and/or legumes.

↓ absorption: intake of inhibitors of iron absorption with meals (tea,
milk, phytates present in grain), achlorhydria, malabsorption.
Women have lower iron stores than men and higher losses due to
menstruation, pregnancy, delivery, and lactation. If the mother has
sufficient iron stores, a neonate is born with enough stores to last 6
mths. After this, iron requirements must be met from the diet —
requirements ↑ with rate of growth. Iron deficiency, therefore,
particularly affects children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.

Clinical features:
brittle nails, koilonychia, angular stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia
(Plummer-Vinson syndrome).

Laboratory features:
(see table 11.1,
p 455). Low serum ferritin (<20 mcg/l) is specific
but can be insensitive as it is an acute phase protein. Ferritin >100
mcg/l generally excludes iron deficiency, even in the setting of
infection.

Management
1. Ferrous sulphate 200 mg tds. Expect a Hb rise of 1-3 g/dl after 4
weeks of therapy if iron deficiency is the cause of anaemia (this can
be used as a diagnostic test). Continue iron therapy for 3 mths after
normalization of Hb to replenish stores.
2. Identify and treat the underlying cause and any other haematinic
deficiencies (e.g. folate).
3. Severe anaemia with signs of heart failure may require blood
transfusion.

Notes
Severely malnourished children should not receive iron supplements
until at least 15 days into a feeding programme because of the ↑ risk

of bacterial sepsis and toxicity related to free radicals.
To improve absorption, oral iron preparations should be taken
between meals and with vitamin C (e.g. orange juice, ascorbic acid
tablets).
Oral iron should not be taken with antibiotics or antacids.
Side-effects include GI upset (try lower dose or take with meals),
constipation, green/black stools.

Intravenous iron
Failure to respond to oral iron may be due to malabsorption, poor
compliance, ongoing excessive iron loss, concomitant anaemia of
chronic disease, or an erroneous diagnosis. The first three may
respond to IV iron thereby preventing the need for transfusion. The
first dose should be given slowly because of the risk of adverse
reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, local irritation). IM iron injections are
not recommended because they are painful, there is a risk of
abscess formation, and absorption is unpredictable.

Prevention of iron deficiency
Nutritional advice: eat meat and legumes with vitamin C (e.g.
orange juice) and avoid tea, dairy products, or cereals as these
inhibit iron absorption.
Prophylactic iron supplements: iron supplements have been
recommended for children > 6 mths and pregnant women where
the prevalence of anaemia exceeds 40% because there is a high
probability that iron deficiency contributes to anaemia in these
populations. Supervised weekly/twice weekly supplementation
schedules are effective for prevention of iron deficiency in school
children. However, routine supplementation for children is under
review following studies suggesting that where malaria
transmission is high, routine iron supplementation may be lead to
↑ malarial and other infections.
Anti-helminthics: empiric treatment may be helpful in those with
anaemia where helminth infections are common.

Anaemia of inflammation
Previously termed ‘anaemia of chronic disease’, this anaemia is
associated with chronic inflammatory or malignant disease in which
there is ↓ RBC production, abnormalities of iron utilization, and ↓
erythropoietin levels and/or response. These abnormalities are
mediated by cytokines released as a result of the underlying disease
and by hepcidin, a molecule released by the liver in response to
infection or inflammation that blocks the release of iron from
enterocytes and macrophages (as a bacteriostatic measure).

Causes
Chronic inflammatory disease.
Infectious (e.g. TB, HIV, lung abscess, osteomyelitis, pneumonia,
SBE).
Non-infectious (e.g. RA, SLE, other connective tissue disorders,
sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease).
Malignancy (e.g. carcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma).

Clinical features:
are of anaemia as well as those relating to the underlying diagnosis

Differential diagnosis:
anaemia of chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism,
other microcytic anaemias (see box,
p 459).

Laboratory features:
mild normocytic (occasionally microcytic), normochromic anaemia.
Low reticulocyte count for degree of anaemia. ↓ serum iron and TIBC.
Normal or ↑ serum ferritin levels and a low/normal transferrin
saturation. ↑ markers of inflammation: ESR, CRP.

Management
1. Treat the underlying cause; recombinant erythropoietin may help
anaemia caused by HIV, malignancy, or chemotherapy. Blood
transfusions are a last resort.
2. Anaemia of inflammation may be complicated by another form of
anaemia (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency), renal failure,
bone marrow failure, hypersplenism, or endocrine abnormality.
These must also be addressed.
3. A ferritin <100 mcg/l may suggest concomitant iron deficiency, but
there is little response to oral iron because of the block of iron
uptake in the small bowel. Intravenous iron may be required.

Sideroblastic anaemia
A rare cause of refractory anaemia caused by deranged heme
(haem) biosynthesis in red cell precursors in the bone marrow. This
leads to ↓ Hb production and ineffective haemopoiesis. There are
two forms:
Hereditary: usually X-linked. Associated with moderate
hepatosplenomegaly.
Acquired: either 1° (myelodysplasia) or 2° (myeloproliferative
disorders, alcohol, drugs such as isoniazid).

Laboratory findings:
Ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow (i.e. erythropoietic cells with
iron-containing granules (mitochondria) arranged around the
nucleus in a ring)

Hereditary:
hypochromia, microcytosis, variation in red cell size and shape, low
MCH and MCH(C).

Acquired (myelodysplasia):
dysplastic morphology of leukocytes and erythrocytes on blood film,
macrocytosis, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia may be
present

Management

In severe cases, repeated blood transfusion may be necessary but
this risks iron overload. Splenectomy is contraindicated because of
an associated thrombotic risk. The hereditary type may respond to
high-dose pyridoxine therapy (b p 652). 1° acquired disease may
respond to erythropoietin if available. In 2° disease, treat the
underlying cause.

Macrocytic anaemias
Folate deficiency
Folic acid is present in green vegetables and fruits such as bananas. It
is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum. The body's stores of folate
are limited and clinical deficiency occurs within 2 months. States of
rapid cell division (e.g. growth spurts, pregnancy, haemolytic anaemia)
↑ folate utilization and warrant prophylactic supplementation with 400
mcg folic acid. Reduced dietary intake (e.g. in alcoholics, the
malnourished, and elderly) can also lead to clinical deficiency. Mild
folate deficiency should prompt testing of, or treatment with, vitamin
B12.

Vitamin B12 deficiency
Vitamin B12 is present in meat or dairy animal products. The
absorption of vitamin B12 is complex and requires proteases and
binding factors released in the stomach and combination with intrinsic
factor before uptake in the terminal ileum. Deficiency may result from
a block at any of these steps. Stores of vitamin B12 take 2-3 years to
deplete even after absorption has ceased. Vitamin B12 is essential for
DNA production. The combined metabolic role of vitamin B12 and
folate explains the similarity of the clinical and laboratory features in
both of their deficiency states. There are unique neurological
manifestations of B12 deficiency.

Clinical features
Mild jaundice, glossitis, angular stomatitis, purpura due to

thrombocytopenia, sterility, reversible melanin skin pigmentation, and
increased susceptibility to infections. Neuropathy due to subacute
combined degeneration of the cord (loss of vibration sense,
hypertonia, weakness, and sensory ataxia), psychosis, and dementia
are specific to a lack of vitamin B12.

Laboratory findings
↑ MCV and MCH, normal MCHC, low reticulocyte count, ↓ WCC and
platelets in severe cases. Blood film: oval macrocytes and
hypersegmented neutrophils, basophilic stippling. Slightly ↑ serum
unconjugated bilirubin and LDH because of ineffective erythropoiesis.

Management
Replacement therapy
Folic acid 5 mg PO daily for 4 months; maintenance requirements
depend on underlying disease.
Hydroxycobalamin (vitamin B12) — 6 injections of 1 mg IM over 1-2
weeks and maintenance with 1 mg every 3 months. Oral vitamin B12
therapy can be given if malabsorption is excluded. Anaemia should
resolve over months.

Prophylaxis
Fortification and dietary modification. Consider prophylactic
treatment (e.g. folic acid 400 mcg/day) in pregnancy, severe
haemolytic anaemia, after partial gastrectomy and ileal resection.

Haemolytic anaemias
Haemolysis is the process by which RBCs are broken down and their
components metabolized. This occurs in the reticuloendothelial system
(RES) in the hepatic and splenic sinusoids. Under certain circumstances
(e.g. sickling crisis, severe oxidative damage), red cells may lyse
within the circulation. Red cells normally remain in the circulation for
7120 days but their life span can be shortened due to abnormalities
inside the red cells (e.g. haemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies), in/on
their membrane (e.g. structural defects, deposition of antibody or
complement), or due to mechanisms arising outside the red cell.
The bone marrow is able to compensate up to 5 times the normal
turnover rate given adequate haematinics and a healthy marrow
(compensated haemolysis); if haemolysis exceeds this or there are
haematinic deficiencies or associated disease, anaemia results.

Laboratory findings
↑ Red cell destruction: unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, ↑ LDH, ↑
urinary urobilinogen, ↑ faecal urobilinogen.

↑ Red cell production: polychromasia, reticulocytosis causing ↑ MCV.
Intravascular haemolysis: ↓/absent haptoglobins, ↓ haemopexin,
haem/methaemoglobin, positive Schumm's test (methaemalbumin),
haemosiderinuria, haem/methaemoglobinuria.
Genetic abnormalities of RBCs are extremely prevalent in the tropics
(and to a lesser extent, in temperate zones). Despite the disadvantage
of the homozygous state of some of these abnormalities, they persist
within populations because the heterozygous state provides a degree
of protection against severe malaria. This is either by altering the
environment within the RBC or by conferring resistance to various
stages in the parasite's lifecycle. For example, the presence of HbS (
p 474) confers a 10-fold reduction in risk of severe malaria. Most of
these disorders predispose to a degree of haemolysis.

Acquired haemolytic anaemia
Drug-induced immune haemolytic anaemia: occurs when drugs
bind RBCs (e.g. high-dose penicillin), form new RBC antigens (e.g.
quinidine), or provoke auto-antibodies (methyldopa, mefenamic
acid, L-dopa). A careful drug history (including herbal
preparations) is crucial.
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia: can be caused by cold (IgM) or
warm (IgG) antibodies. They may be 1° (idiopathic) or 2° to
lymphoproliferative disorders, malignancy, autoimmune diseases,
or infections. The direct anti-globulin (Coomb's test) test is
positive because the patient's red cells are antibody-coated.
Warm AHA presents as chronic or acute haemolytic anaemia
with splenomegaly. Management includes treating any
underlying causes. Specific therapy is with steroids (e.g.
prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily) until Hb>10 g/dl, then gradually
reduce. Splenectomy is an option if this fails. Blood transfusion
may be required in severe cases.
Cold AHA presents as chronic anaemia made worse by the cold
and is associated with Raynaud's phenomenon and acrocyanosis.
Management involves treatment of the underlying cause;
steroids are not helpful. Advise the patient to keep warm.

Chlorambucil can be helpful if there is underlying lymphoma.
Splenectomy does not usually help as IgM-coated cells are
removed in the liver.
Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria: is caused by DonathLandsteiner antibody (occurs after mumps, measles, chickenpox,
syphilis, especially in children). This binds red cells after a cold
exposure, causing a complement-mediated lysis which manifests
clinically as haemoglobinuria.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency
G6PD deficiency predisposes to oxidative damage of the RBC and
therefore haemolysis.

Distribution:
G6PD deficiency affects >2 million people with prevalence rates
reaching 25%. Fig. 11.1 shows the world distribution of G6PD deficiency.
Superimposed are three zones where different G6PD variants reach
polymorphic frequencies: zone I (GdMediterranean), zone II
(GdMediterranean, GdCanton, GdUnion, GdMahidol), and zone III
(GdA). These variants have different clinical severities e.g. GdA causes
moderate, intermittent haemolysis whereas GdMediterranean and
GdCanton are more severe.

Clinical features:
G6PD deficiency has sex-linked inheritance, so is much more common
in boys. Most people affected are asymptomatic. The main feature is
of episodic haemolysis which may be severe and intravascular in
nature, particularly in the non-African mutations. Chronic haemolysis
is unusual. In Africa, adults with G6PD deficiency usually only suffer
mild haemolysis but neonates may develop severe hyperbilirubinaemia
and kernicterus. Haemolytic episodes are precipitated by infection
and, to a lesser extent, drugs.

Diagnosis
Between attacks:
Tests of enzyme activity rely on NADPH production and its detection by
direct fluorescence or by reduction of a coloured dye to its colourless
form. These are sensitive, simple, and inexpensive for detecting
hemizygous males and heterozygous women.

During a crisis:
the blood film may show ‘bite’ cells and ‘blister’ cells. Testing for G6PD
activity during a crisis is often unhelpful because haemolysis
eliminates older erythrocytes which have the lowest G6PD activity, so
only the youngest cells (which may have normal G6PD activity) remain.
Following a crisis, testing should be delayed for 6 weeks. In more
severe variants, a greater proportion of erythrocytes have low G6PD
activity so delaying enzyme assays may not be necessary.

Management
Treat underlying infections avoiding medications known to
precipitate haemolysis.
Withdraw any drug that could have precipitated the crisis.
Maintain a high urine output (to prevent pre-renal failure).
Folic acid supplements may be useful if deficiency is possible or if
recurrent haemolytic episodes.
G6PD-deficient babies are prone to neonatal jaundice and, in severe
cases, phototherapy and exchange transfusion are necessary.

P.472

Autosomal recessive inheritance. Mainly affects N. Europeans.
Clinical features are variable. May present with neonatal jaundice
or, later, with haemolytic anaemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice.
Diagnosis: blood film shows variable appearances. Definitive
diagnosis is by enzyme assay.
Management: is supportive e.g. folic acid supplements, blood
transfusion where necessary; splenectomy may improve severe
cases.

Red cell membranopathies
These conditions may provide a degree of protection against malaria
due to reduced penetration of the erythrocyte by merozoites.

1. Hereditary spherocytosis
Usually autosomal dominant inheritance. Mainly found in N.
Europeans.
Clinical features are variable: positive family history, mild anaemia
(8-12 g/dl), intermittent jaundice, splenomegaly, pigment
cholelithiasis.
Diagnosis: blood film shows spherocytes, ↑ MCH, ↑ reticulocytes, ↑
lysis in osmotic tests, negative direct antiglobulin test.
Management: folic acid 5 mg/day. Splenectomy for those most

severely affected (see

p 492).

2. Hereditary elliptocytosis
Autosomal dominant inheritance. Usually asymptomatic; haemolysis
may be severe in homozygotes. There may be episodes of jaundice and
moderate splenomegaly following intercurrent infections.
Diagnosis: elliptical red cells, parental studies.
Management: is not usually required; folic acid supplements and
splenectomy may help if haemolysis is significant.

3. South-east Asian hereditary ovalocytosis
Autosomal dominant inheritance. Common in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Philippines, PNG, and Solomon Islands. It is not associated with
haemolytic anaemia.

Sickle cell anaemia

P.474

The sickle gene is common in equatorial Africa (frequency up to 25%),
Saudi Arabia, and S Asia, but less common in the Mediterranean and
the mixed populations of the Americas (frequency 5%). It is due to a
single point mutation in the Hb β-globin gene chain. When
deoxygenated, HbS molecules polymerize into elongated structures
causing erythrocytes to deform and haemolyse. Sickled red cells are
rigid and block the microcirculation in various organs, causing infarcts.
The inheritance of the disease is autosomal co-dominant (i.e. sicklecell trait is due to heterozygous inheritance, HbAS). The trait is
generally asymptomatic. Sickle cell disease occurs with homozygous
inheritance of the gene (HbSS) or co-inheritance of another β-globin
chain disorder such as HbC (see below). Sickle cell disease and G6PD
deficiency may occur together because of the high prevalence of both
conditions in some regions. It provides protection against malaria.

Other sickling syndromes

HbSC disease occurs in west Africa. There is less haemolysis than
with HbSS. Some patients are asymptomatic and therefore may
present only in adulthood. Splenomegaly is a common clinical
finding. Anaemia is less severe than in HbSS but vaso-occlusive
complications (e.g. avascular necrosis, proliferative retinopathy) are
prominent because of the higher haematocrit and may lead to
significant disability in adulthood. Electrophoresis shows two
haemoglobin bands, HbS and HbC. The blood film has more target
cells than in HbSS as well as irregularly contracted cells.
HbSβ0thalassaemia occurs mostly in North Africa, Sicily, and mixed
populations of the Americas. Clinically similar to HbSS, there is a
lower incidence of stroke. The blood film shows hypochromic
microcytic RBCs and target cells. Hb electrophoresis shows HbS,
absence of HbA, and elevated HbA2 and HbF. Definitive diagnosis can
be made by parental studies or DNA analysis.
HbSβ+thalassaemia is the doubly heterozygous condition most
commonly seen in west Africa. The clinical course and degree of
anaemia is milder than HbSS. However, proliferative retinopathy
occurs. Definitive diagnosis with Hb electrophoresis shows HbA 530%, HbS 70-95%.
HbSDPunjab and HbSOArab are as severe as HbSS. HbD occurs in Sikh
and mixed populations.
HbSE, HbSLepore, and HbSHPFH (hereditary persistence of foetal
haemoglobin). All these conditions have a mild clinical course
compared to HbSS.

Clinical features of sickle cell anaemia
Severe haemolytic anaemia punctuated by severe pain crises. Young
patients alternate periods of good health with acute crises. Later,
chronic ill health supervenes due to organ damage. Symptoms begin
after 6 months of age as the HbF level declines. The first signs are
often of acute dactylitis due to occlusive necrosis of the small bones of
the hands and feet, resulting in digits of varying length. The long bones
are affected in older children and adults. Anaemia (Hb 6-8 g/dl;
reticulocytes 10-20%) is well-tolerated because of cardiac
compensation and a lower affinity of HbS for oxygen.
The severity of complications depends on a number of factors including
the proportion of non-sickle Hb molecules (e.g. HbF) and the ratio of α

to β chains, which may be modified by concomitant α thalassaemia
trait or conditions affecting β-globin chain production (e.g. Bantu
haplotype is associated with severe disease, whilst Senegalese and
Asian haplotypes are less severe).

Types of crises
Painful vascular-occlusive: frequent and precipitated by infections,
acidosis, dehydration, or hypoxia. Infarcts often occur in the axial
skeleton, lungs, and spleen. Repeated splenic infarction leads to
hyposplenism in adulthood. Crises can involve the CNS (in 7% of
patients) and spinal cord.
Visceral sequestration: due to sickling within organs and pooling of
blood.
Chest: pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, fever, chest pain, tachypnoea,
cough, wheeze. There is often concomitant infection, microvascular
occlusion, and bronchoconstriction. Chest crises can arise during a
painful crisis; patients should be monitored carefully for this
complication, which can be fatal.
Haemolytic: ↑ rate of haemolysis with a fall in Hb. Usually
accompanying a painful crisis. Concomitant G6PD deficiency may
worsen haemolysis.
Aplastic: arrest of red cell production due to infection with
parvovirus and/or folate deficiency. Characterized by a sudden fall
in Hb and reticulocytes; emergency blood transfusion can be lifesaving.

Complications:
pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, stroke, proliferative
retinopathy, cardiomegaly, renal concentrating defect, papillary
necrosis, osteomyelitis (often due to Salmonella spp), skin ulcers,
proliferative retinopathy, priapism, hepatic dysfunction, pigmented
gallstones. Infectious complications are the most common cause of
death. There is a particular risk with encapsulated bacteria (e.g.
pneumococcus, meningococcus, haemophilus) because of

hyposplenism. Survival is linked to socio-economic conditions.

Laboratory findings
Hb 6-8 g/dl, ↑ reticulocyte count, normal MCV. If is MCV low,
consider concomitant iron deficiency or thalassaemia.
Sickle cells and target cells in the blood film; features of splenic
atrophy (e.g. Howell-Jolly bodies) may also be seen.
Screening tests such as the sickle solubility test (e.g. with
dithionate and Na2HPO4) will be positive in the presence of >20%
HbS. These tests are, therefore, also positive in sickle cell trait
and compound heterozygotes. They do not require advanced
laboratory methods and are widely available. False negative
results occur in infants <6 mths old with HbSS because of the
predominance of HbF.
Detection of HbS or other haemoglobin variants, Hb
electrophoresis, iso-electric focusing, and high-performance liquid
chromatography. Some of these tests provide quantification of the
abnormal Hb but are likely to be available only at referral
centres. Expect 30-40% HbS with HbAS (≤35% with concomitant α
thalassaemia), >90% with HbSS.

Sickle-cell disease and pregnancy
Sickle-cell disease predisposes to intrauterine growth retardation,
pre-eclampsia, pre-term labour, in utero foetal death, and ↑ risk
of sickle-related complications in the mother. Sickle-cell trait is
not a problem, except that pyelonephritis is more common.
Early access to antenatal care is important to allow monitoring
for these complications.
Folic acid supplements are essential to prevent megaloblastic
anaemia and birth defects.
Delivery should be non-operative where possible. Consider preoperative exchange transfusion before caesarian section in
complicated pregnancies.
Test neonate for haemoglobinopathy.

Sickle-cell disease and surgery
The incidence of severe complications in sickle-cell patients
undergoing surgery is 30-60%, depending on the procedure.
Equivalent improved outcomes are shown with either top-up or
exchange transfusions. Minor operations can be carried out safely
without pre-op transfusion, providing patients are well-hydrated.

Management of painful crises
Acute pain is the most common reason to seek medical attention:
Exclude other causes of pain.
Keep hydrated — PO, NG, or IV (if other routes have failed).
Keep the patient warm.
O2 therapy is only necessary if hypoxic.
Effective pain relief — can reduce time spent in hospital;
undertreating can lead to drug-seeking behaviour and a painoriented personality.
Parenteral opiates are often required but IM route can cause
abscesses. Monitor the response to analgesia closely; use a pictorial
pain scale in children.
Oral analgesia — NSAIDs are good for bone pain. Give with ulcerprotection (e.g. H2-receptor antagonist or PPI) and monitor renal
function. Oral opioids.
Inhaled NO — risk of subacute combined degeneration of cord with
repeated/prolonged use; may be beneficial in acute chest syndrome.

Management of infections
The most common cause of death in sickle-cell disease.
Treat bacteraemia rapidly: start antibiotics empirically if febrile and
acutely unwell. Greatest mortality from sepsis with encapsulated

organisms; therefore treat empirically to cover S pneumoniae, Hib,
N meningitidis (e.g. ceftriaxone 2 g OD). This has the advantage of
once-daily dosing. Where microbiological diagnosis is possible, send
urine and blood for culture, consider early LP if signs consistent with
meningitis, CXR for suspected pneumonia/chest syndrome.
Proven/suspected meningitis: treat with ceftriaxone for 2 weeks.
Acute chest syndrome: usually triggered by infection. Use antibiotic
to cover S pneumoniae, Hib, mycoplasma, and C pneumoniae (e.g.
cefuroxime and erythromycin). Supportive measures, including
bronchodilators. Consider exchange transfusion if severe. Incentive
spirometry (use of a spirometer to guide deep respirations at regular
intervals) can reduce the risk of acute chest syndrome developing
from painful crisis involving the ribs or back.
Osteomyelitis: ideally confirm organism with cultures, or empirically
cover S paratyphi, E coli, and S aureus (e.g. cefotaxime and
ciprofloxacin). Requires at least 6 weeks of therapy; may require
surgery. Monitor closely for recurrence.
Malaria: non-specific cause of fever and associated with mortality in
sickle-cell disease.
Good supportive care: is essential to prevent other complications.
Monitor fluid balance carefully to prevent overload; treat pain and
hypoxia.

Maintenance of health in sickle-cell disease
Screening: greatest mortality <5 years of age so early diagnosis is
important to ↓ mortality. Selective screening (e.g. pregnant
women, newborn children born to carriers, relatives of those with
the disease) may miss a significant proportion of cases so
universal screening is being implemented in some wealthy
countries.
Education: general health education. Also advise to seek medical
attention early (especially if high fever) and to use clean drinking
water and insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent malaria.
Genetic counselling is important to identify affected relatives and

to plan pregnancy.
Avoid factors precipitating crisis: especially dehydration, hypoxia,
infections, cold environments.
Folic acid supplements: 1-5 mg/day in adults.
Protect against infection: vaccinate against S pneumoniae, Hib,
meningococcus, hepatitis B, influenza. Educate parents/patients
about reduced mortality with compliance to prophylactic
penicillin (125 mg PO bd for children <3 yrs, 250 mg bd thereafter).
Advise lifelong anti-malarial prophylaxis.
Detection of acute splenic sequestration: teach parents of young
children to palpate the spleen soon after diagnosis and to attend
clinic if the child becomes unwell, with an enlarging spleen.
Screening for retinopathy: should be carried out annually from the
age of 15 years.

Hydoxycarbamide:
↓ frequency of crises, chest syndrome, hospitalisations, and
mortality; should be considered for those with painful crises >2-3
times per year. It is difficult to implement in poorer countries
because it requires regular monitoring of FBC to prevent cytopenias
and, ideally, of HbF% for maximal effect. It should be avoided in
pregnancy.

Indications for transfusion in sickle-cell disease
Transfusions are only indicated in sickle-cell disease in specific
circumstances because increasing Hb levels above steady state ↑ the
risk of thrombosis. Indications for transfusion include correction of
blood loss or ↓ production or sequestration (e.g. post-operatively;
during sequestration or aplastic crises; during acute severe illness).

Exchange transfusions:
can be performed to ↓ HbS%, and thus the risk of vaso-occlusion.
Aim for Hb 10 g/dl, Hct ≤32%, HbS ~30%. Exchange blood transfusions
are only beneficial in specific circumstances (e.g. to prevent/↓ risk
of stroke, during pregnancy in women with a past history of severe
complications).

Thalassaemia
β Thalassaemia
Clinically, β thalassaemia is classified as minor (slight ↓ in β globin
chain production, asymptomatic), intermedia (moderate ↓ in β globin
chain production, mild symptoms, occasional transfusion requirement),
and major (total/almost total reduction in globin chain production,
severe symptoms, need for regular transfusion support).

β Thalassaemia minor
Usually heterozygous inheritance. There is palpable splenomegaly and
moderate anaemia during pregnancy. This can cause compensatory
placental hypertrophy and mild intrauterine growth retardation, but
does not significantly affect perinatal mortality.
Diagnosis: mild anaemia (e.g. Hb 9-11 g/dl); blood film shows moderate
anisocytosis, microcytosis (MCV<76 fL, MCH<26 pg), hypochromia with a
few target and tear drop cells. Basophilic stippling may occur. Hb
electrophoresis shows ↑ HbA2(4-6.5%); HbF may also be ↑. Note: iron
deficiency can mask and co-exist with β thalassaemia minor. Testing
for thalassaemia should be delayed until the patient is iron replete.

Management:
includes accurate diagnosis to avoid future treatment of the
hypochromic anaemia with iron, education about thalassaemic
syndromes, and genetic counselling.

β Thalassaemia intermedia
Variable severity from mild haemolytic anaemia to occasional severe
anaemia. In general, splenomegaly, bony expansion, and complications
of iron overload are present, despite only requiring intermittent
transfusion support.

Diagnosis:
features are intermediate between those of β thalassaemia major and
minor.

General management:
As for sickle-cell disease, this involves screening, general health
education (active immunization, clean water sources, hygiene
measures, use of impregnated bed nets to avoid malaria, early
attendance at medical facilities if unwell and especially for febrile
illnesses). Specific measures include:
Folate supplements (5 mg/day for adults).
Transfusion support — if severe anaemia or failure to thrive, or to
suppress erythroid expansion (e.g. in the case of skeletal deformity).
May need to consider iron chelation if ferritin >1000 mcg/l even if
not regularly transfused.
Splenectomy — hypersplenism can ↑ transfusion requirements.
Vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria should be given 2 weeks
pre-operatively (see section on splenomegaly).

β Thalassaemia distribution and pathogenesis
β thalassaemia occurs across southern Europe, Africa, the Middle
East, India, and south-east Asia, and in immigrants from these
areas. It is caused by a variety of mutations of the β globin gene
complex. Excess free β globin chains precipitate as inclusion bodies
in red cell precursors, leading to their destruction. This causes
ineffective erythropoiesis and ↑ splenic uptake of RBCs. There is
compensatory ↑ iron uptake and expansion of erythropoiesis within
haemopoietic tissues including those in extra-medullary sites. This
expansion, together with iron overload and hypersplenism, causes
many of the clinical manifestations.

α Thalassaemia

This arises as a result of a defect (usually deletion) of one or more of
the four α-globin genes. α+ thalassaemia trait occurs due to deletion or
inactivation of a single gene (-α/αα) and is common in Africans. This
does not cause anaemia. α0 thalassaemia trait (-/αα) is more common
in the Asian and Mediterranean regions; there is mild anaemia and the
MCV and MCH are ↓. The blood film shows hypochromic, microcytic red
cells and target cells. Screening and genetic counselling programmes in
high-prevalence areas ↓ the incidence of compound heterozygotes.
Epidemiological studies from Melanesia and Papua New Guinea suggest
that α+ thalassaemia protects against malaria.
Unlike β thalassaemia, more severe forms of α thalassaemia affect the
foetus and neonate because foetal Hb (α2γ2) requires α chains.
Compared to β thalassaemia, α thalassaemia is characterized by
haemolysis rather than ineffective erythropoiesis because the
tetramers of excess β chains (HbH) are more soluble and less
destructive to erythroid cells than α tetramers. HbH inclusions in RBCs
can be detected with specific stains; HbH is detected on Hb
electrophoresis.

HbH disease
HbH is 5-30% with moderate haemolytic anaemia (Hb 7-10 g/dl). The
clinical features often resemble β thalassaemia intermedia. Children
may have growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities; there is a
variable degree of hepatosplenomegaly. Transfusions are not usually
required. Splenectomy may be of benefit.

Hb Bart's hydrops foetalis
The foetus lacks all α genes and is stillborn or dies shortly after
delivery.

β Thalassaemia major
Often due to inheritance of two different mutations (compound
heterogygote) each affecting β globin synthesis. Untreated, most
patients die before 5 years of age from cardiac failure or infection.

Clinical features
Failure to thrive: at 3-6 months of age, when the switch from γ to βchain production should take place; puberty is often delayed and
there may be limited development of sexual characteristics.
Hepatosplenomegaly: due to haemolysis, extramedullary
haemopoiesis, and later in the disease, iron overload from
transfusions. Splenomegaly ↑ blood requirements by ↑ RBC
destruction and pooling.
Bone expansion: as a result of intense marrow hyperplasia; leads to
skeletal deformity, including the characteristic thalassaemic facies
— prominent frontal and parietal bones, maxillary enlargement, and
flattening of the nasal bridge. There is osteoporosis (↑ tendency to
fracture) and bossing of the skull with ‘hair-on-end’ appearance on
X-ray.
Infections: predisposed to infection for a variety of reasons (e.g.
defective splenic function). Severe gastroenteritis caused by Yersinia
enterocolitica is associated with desferrioxamine treatment.
Transmission of viral hepatitis is also increased, probably because of
iron overload and transfusion exposure.
Iron overload: due to transfusion therapy (each 500 ml unit of blood
contains 250 mg of iron) and ↑ iron absorption. Iron accumulation →
liver damage, endocrine damage (failure of growth, delayed or
absent puberty, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), and
myocardial damage. In the absence of intensive iron chelation,
death occurs in the second or third decade, usually from CCF or
cardiac arrhythmias. Clinically apparent abnormalities usually
appear after ~50 units (12 g of iron) but organ damage and skin
pigmentation occur before this.

Diagnosis:
severe hypochromic microcytic anaemia with ↑ reticulocyte count.
Blood film shows many nucleated red cells, tear drop and target cells,
as well as cells of variable morphology and basophilic stippling.
Electrophoresis shows absent HbA, ↑ HbF, and variable HbA2 (often ↑).

Management of β thalassaemia major
General measures: as for sickle-cell disease: screening, health
education, immunization, clean water sources, hygiene measures,
use of impregnated bed nets to avoid malaria, early attendance
at medical facilities if unwell (especially with febrile illnesses).
Transfusion: aims to suppress the patient's own (ineffective)
erythropoiesis, to prevent bony deformity and to normalize
growth. This can be achieved with a regular transfusions of 20
mls/kg packed RBCs every 4-6 weeks to maintain Hb >9.5 g/dl.
Start regular transfusions when growth chart monitoring shows
failure to thrive (usually around 6-12 months of age). Blood should
be matched for ABO, Rh, Kell antigens, and, if possible, filtered to
remove WBCs. If blood requirements exceed 300 mls/kg/year then
the reason for this should be investigated (e.g. hypersplenism,
haemolytic transfusion reactions). Recipients of regular
transfusions should receive hepatitis B vaccination and be
monitored for transfusion-transmitted infections.
Folic acid: give regularly, especially for dietary insufficiency.
Iron chelation: to prevent/treat overload. Commence in infants
after 10-15 units of transfusion. Give desferrioxamine by SC
infusion via a syringe pump driver, 20-40 mg/kg over 8-12 h, 3-7
days per week. Desferrioxamine in high doses, especially in
children, may lead to neutropenia, high tone deafness, loss of
visual acuity, and growth retardation and patients should be
monitored for these complications. Other side-effects include
joint pain and hepatic dysfunction. The oral chelator, deferiprone,
may be considered if parenteral chelation is not possible but it
has also been associated with blood dyscrasias. Give vitamin C
100-200 mg daily with chelation to ↑ iron excretion.
Splenectomy: may ↓the amount of blood required. Delay until >6
years because there is ↑ risk of life-threatening infections postsplenectomy before this age. Immunize against encapsulated
bacteria two weeks prior to splenectomy (see
p 492).
Monitor growth and sexual development: with weight and height
charts as well as clinical examination. Failure to thrive may

indicate ↑ transfusion needs or delayed puberty. If secondary
sexual characteristics are not adequately developed by 16 years
of age, consider testosterone/oestrogen supplements or specialist
referral.

Blood transfusion
Blood transfusion can be life-saving in certain circumstances but it
should only be a last resort and if indicated by clinical features.
Transfusion practice is now very conservative due to increased
awareness of risks of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) and
better understanding of the role of haemodynamic compensatory
mechanisms.
Transfusion-associated risks are high in the developing world because
of the high prevalence of TTIs and lack of quality assurance systems.
To ↓ the use and need for transfusions, it is important to prescribe
according to guidelines and to prevent/treat anaemia effectively e.g.
by controlling malaria and improving nutrition.
In countries where supplies of safe blood are scarce, the following may
guide the decision to transfuse:
Signs of severe heart failure.
Hb <5 g/dl with symptoms.
Hb <4 g/dl in any situation.
Acute blood loss resulting in shock or signs of heart failure despite
infusion of crystalloid or colloid fluids.
Need for emergency major surgery with pre-operative Hb<7 g/dl.
Whole blood is used for most transfusions in developing countries. If
facilities for refrigerated centrifugation of blood are available, then
more efficient use can be made of the blood by splitting it into RBC
concentrates and fresh frozen plasma.

Ensuring blood safety and supply

The objective is to make safe blood available:
Preventing unnecessary transfusions.
Donor-screening and self-exclusion with a health questionnaire
designed to exclude those at high risk of TTIs (e.g. HIV, hepatitis C).
The use of a panel of voluntary, unpaid donors who have repeatedly
tested negative for TTIs and who pass a basic medical test (check
pulse, BP, screen for anaemia and other major illnesses).
Implementation of SOPs for all processes involved in collection,
storage, testing, and administration of blood including adequate
controls and quality assurance (e.g. two grouping techniques should
be used in parallel to prevent fatal ABO-incompatible transfusion
reactions).
Screening all blood for TTIs including HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis,
hepatitis C, and, if appropriate, trypanosomiasis and malaria.
Regular training for those involved in transfusion to ensure
competency and safety.
Use of a closed system allowing collection into blood bags with
anticoagulant, testing and, if necessary, division, or fractionation of
products.
Appropriate storage systems in thermostatically controlled fridges
with back-up power supplies.
A labelling system for blood bags, samples, and patient identification
as well as a procedure of checks at the bedside to ensure the correct
unit is administered to the correct patient.

Administration of blood
Blood should only be removed from the fridge immediately prior to
use. When administering a blood transfusion:
Check the patient details with those of the unit of blood to ensure
the unit has been issued to that patient and is compatible with the
group of the patient.

Give IV via a blood-giving set with a filter.
Keep a record of the volume and units given.
Check pulse, BP, respiratory rate, temperature at start of
transfusion, after 15-30 mins, and every hour during the transfusion.
Observe the patient for the first 10 minutes of a transfusion.
Monitor carefully for signs of fluid overload.

Exchange transfusions
In certain situations, an exchange transfusion is indicated to ↓ the risk
of volume overload or to ↓ the concentration of patients' red cells or
plasma. For example in:
Heart failure 2° to anaemia.
Complications of sickle cell disease.
Haemolytic disease of the newborn.
Hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates.
Specialist advice should be sought regarding details of volumes and
procedures for exchange transfusion.

Transfusion reactions
1. Severe transfusion reaction:
may be due to ABO incompatibility or bacterial contamination of the
unit. Heralded by pain at site of cannula, back/chest pain, agitation,
dyspnoea, nausea, flushing, or hypotension.
Stop the transfusion immediately. Do not flush the giving set.
Ensure IV access, catherize patient, and start fluids to ensure
diuresis.
Monitor renal and liver function, clotting parameters,
haemoglobinuria.
Consider broad-spectrum antibiotic cover after taking blood cultures

and send donor unit for culture (if possible).
Give bronchodilators if wheezing; antihistamine and hydrocortisone
as for allergic reaction.
Laboratory to re-cross match unit, repeat patient's grouping, and
monitor for development of red cell antibodies.

2. Simple febrile and allergic reactions:
If temperature ↑ by >1°C from baseline or the patient develops
urticarial rash or itching, stop the transfusion, check vital signs, give
paracetamol, and, if the patient remains well after 15 minutes, restart
the transfusion at a slower rate.

3. Delayed transfusion reaction:
usually occurs 5-10 days post-transfusion and is due to sensitization to
red cells following previous transfusions or pregnancy. Clinical features
include fever, hyperbilirubinaemia, and anaemia. Samples should be
taken for grouping, direct Coombs' test, repeat cross-matching, and
antibody screening and results compared with a pre-transfusion
sample.

Acute leukaemias
Characterized by an excessive proliferation of immature
haematopoietic cells (blasts) in the peripheral blood. Without
treatment, acute leukaemias have a median survival of months.
Although they are aggressive disorders, chemotherapy may be
curative; this is not the case with indolent haematological
malignancies which may not require treatment at diagnosis but are
incurable with standard chemotherapy.

Diagnosis:
of acute leukaemias relies on analysis of blood and bone marrow
samples to establish the origin of the malignant cells and associated
genetic abnormalities.

Treatment:
is with cycles of chemotherapy. Normal haematopoietic tissue is also
affected by chemotherapy, leading to anaemia, neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia, so red cell and platelet transfusions may be
required and there is a significant risk of infection.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
is a common malignancy in children with peaks at 2-5 yrs and >40 yrs.
Poor prognostic markers include age <1 or >10 yrs and >30 yrs,
presenting white cell count >50 ×109/l, and certain cytogenetic
abnormalities. Clinical features include bone pain, lymphadenopathy,
hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, haemorrhage, and infections.

Acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML)
has a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. Clinical features are similar
to ALL except that in Africa 10-25% of all patients and ~30% of boys may
present with a solid tumour (chloroma) e.g. in the orbit or skin. Gum
hypertrophy and DIC are features of AML sub-types. Risk factors include
exposure to benzene, radiation, and previous cytotoxic therapy. Poor
prognosis is associated with age >55 years, poor general state of
health, and specific cytogenetic abnormalities.

Causes of lymphadenopathy
Infections

Brucellosis, leptospirosis, typhoid
Tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria
EBV, CMV, HIV, HSV, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella, dengue

Causes of changes in white cell counts:
↑ cell count
Neutrophilia >7.5 × 109/l
Physiological (e.g. Pregnancy).
Acute bacterial infections (e.g. Pneumonia, UTI, abscess).
Tissue damage, inflammation, stress (e.g. Burns, dka).
Malignant disease.
Drugs (e.g. Steroids).
Basophilia >0.1 × 109/l
Myeloproliferative disorders.
Allergic reactions.
Lymphocytosis >3.5 × 109/l
Childhood response to infections.
Certain bacterial infections in adults (e.g. Brucellosis).
Viral and protozoal infections (e.g. CMV, EBV, toxoplasmosis).
Lymphoproliferative disorders.
Monocytosis >1.0 × 109/l
Rarely — chronic bacterial infection (e.g. TB).
Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.
Eosinophilia >0.5 × 109/l
Helminth infections (e.g. Hookworm, hydatid disease,
schisosomiasis — values >3 × 109/l are likely to be due to
katayama fever, strongyloidiasis).
Allergic/skin conditions (e.g. asthma, atopy, drugs, vasculitis,

psoriasis) reactive to leukaemia/lymphoma, connective tissue
disease.
Convalescence from viral or other infections, especially in
infants.

↓ cell count
Neutropenia <2.0 × 109/l
Acute infection (e.g. Dengue fever, overwhelming bacterial
sepsis).
Certain chronic infections (e.g. visceral leishmaniasis, AIDS).
Bone marrow failure or drugs (e.g. chloramphenicol).
Peripheral consumption (e.g. hypersplenism, Felty's syndrome).
Miscellaneous (ethnic, familial, cyclic, chronic, idiopathic).
Lymphopenia <1.5 × 109/l
Common in many acute infections (e.g. TB, hepatitis, pneumonia).
Drugs (e.g. corticosteroids).

Lymphoproliferative disorders
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)
A heterogeneous group of tumours of B and T cell origin. Low-grade
lymphomas run an indolent course but are incurable, while high-grade
lymphomas are more aggressive initially but long-term cure is
achievable. High-grade NHLs are more common in Asia and Africa and,
in Africa, are associated with malaria. Features include:
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, night sweats,
pruritis, fever, pancytopenia.

Burkitt's lymphoma (BL):
is a highly aggressive subtype of NHL. It occurs in malaria-endemic
areas, is related to EBV infection, and is the most common childhood
cancer in tropical Africa. BL has a male predominance with a peak
incidence at 4-7 years but it may also occur in individuals with HIV. It

classically involves the jaw but can occur in any extranodal site.
Steroids or a single dose of IV cyclophosphamide may provide symptom
control and a short-lived remission but intensive chemotherapy is
needed to achieve a 70% cure rate.

Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL)
HL is a malignant proliferation of B lymphocytes. It is more common in
males, with two peaks in young adulthood and middle age. There are
geographical variations in sub-types; nodular sclerosing HL
predominates in published studies, but in developing countries, the
mixed cellularity sub-type is more common and has been linked to EBV
exposure. HL usually presents as painless lymphoadenopathy and 7080% of cases are curable with standard radio/chemotherapy.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
CLL is characterized by proliferation of mature but dysfunctional
lymphocytes and predisposition to infections and, less commonly,
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The M:F ratio is 2:1 and median age
60. There tends to be a lower incidence in tropical than in temperate
regions where it is the most common form of leukaemia. CLL may
present with incidental lymphocytosis (5 - >100 ×109/l),
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or signs of bone marrow
failure. Treatment consists of chemotherapy (e.g. chlorambucil) and
transfusions/antibiotics, as required.

Multiple myeloma (MM)
MM is due to infiltration of the bone marrow with malignant plasma
cells. The incidence is higher in the islands of the Pacific, the
Caribbean, and Africa than in more wealthy countries. Clinical
features include bone pain, pathological fractures, osteopenia,
hypercalcaemia, renal failure, and bone marrow failure with anaemia,
infection, and bleeding. Definitive treatment results in a median
survival of 3-5 years. Supportive treatment includes analgesia,
transfusions, and bisphosphonates.
P.490

Myeloproliferative disorders
A group of disorders characterized by proliferation of haemopoietic
stem cells. These cells retain their ability to differentiate, resulting in
an excess of mature cells of predominantly one lineage. The disorders
share systemic symptoms such as malaise, night sweats, fever, and
weight loss. Splenomegaly, gout, and pruritis on contact with water
are not uncommon. These disorders are not curable, but may be
associated with long survival if treated. Transformation to acute
leukaemia or to marrow fibrosis occurs in a minority.

Polycythaemia
Primary polycythaemia (polycythaemia rubra vera) is associated with
PCV >56% in females, >60% in males, neutrophilia and/or
thrombocytosis, gout, splenomegaly (in 60%), and, less commonly, a
thrombotic event. 2° causes should be excluded. Treatment is by
venesection to ↓ PCV to <45%, aspirin (75 mg od), and
hydroxycarbamide for those at high risk for thrombosis, or with
concomitant thrombocytosis. The median survival is ~15 years in nonelderly patients.

Thrombocytosis
Reactive causes of thrombpocytosis include blood loss, iron deficiency,
infection, inflammation, hyposplenism, and malignancy. Essential
thrombocythaemia is characterized by platelet count persistently >500
× 109/l without an underlying reactive cause. Half of patients are
asymptomatic, 25% have splenomegaly and 25% have a history of
arterial thrombosis at diagnosis. Platelet function may be abnormal in
a minority, especially in those with platelets >1000 × 109/l. Young
patients without risk factors for atherosclerotic disease do not require
treatment. Patients at risk of thrombosis should be given low-dose
aspirin and some may need hydroxycarbamide to ↓ platelet count.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)
Due to uncontrolled proliferation of mature myeloid cells; >95% of

cases have the Philadelphia chromosome. The median age at diagnosis
is 50-60 years, but CML can present in childhood. Most patients present
in the chronic phase, which is often asymptomatic. CML inevitably
progresses to a blastic phase that is clinically indistinguishable from
acute leukaemia and characterized by the proliferation of increasingly
abnormal and dysfunctional cells leading to significant morbidity,
reduced response to therapy, and death. In chronic phase,
hydroxycarbamide 1-2 g should ↓ WCC to normal levels; new
treatments may induce remission in the chronic phase. With
treatment, the chronic phase may last 2-5 years. The disease is only
curable with an allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

Splenomegaly

P.492

The spleen is a major site of antigen presentation and platelet
reservoir. Splenic macrophages remove damaged or old red cells. The
spleen enlarges as a result of over-activity of any of these processes.
The high prevalence of chronic infection/infestation as well as
haemolytic anaemias in the tropics means that splenomegaly is a
common physical sign. Splenomegaly may produce abdominal
distension, discomfort, and early satiety. The spleen is recognized
clinically by its movement with respiration, enlargement towards the
right iliac fossa, the presence of a notch, and the fact that the upper
margin cannot be palpated. Massive splenomegaly may be associated
with blood pooling and cytopenias.

Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS)
HMS occurs very commonly in areas with high malaria transmission,
especially in adults who have taken up residence in the endemic area.
HMS is due to polyclonal lymphoid activation because of an abnormal
immune response to malaria. HMS is difficult to distinguish from
lymphoproliferative disorders, hepato-splenic schistosomiasis, and
visceral leishmaniasis, which may co-exist in the same territory. Once
other causes have been excluded (see box), HMS is a likely diagnosis.
Antimalaria prophylaxis (e.g. proguanil 100 mg/day) for at least 6
months may result in significant regression of the spleen, supporting

the diagnosis.

Splenectomy
Indications for splenectomy include trauma, haemolytic anaemia,
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and (infrequently) for the
purpose of diagnosis. Post-operatively, especially in the first few years,
there is an ↑↑ risk of sepsis (overwhelming post-splenectomy infection
— OPSI) from encapsulated bacteria, particularly Streptococcus
pneumoniae. The risk of OPSI is ~0.5% per year, and even with good
resources, mortality is ~50%, so prevention is essential. If possible,
elective splenectomy should be delayed until >5 years of age because
of increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria. Pneumococcal,
meningococcal, and H influenza b vaccinations should preferably be
given at >2 weeks pre-op; if splenectomy is unplanned, they should be
given >2 weeks post-op; reimmunization for pneumococcus should be
repeated every 5 years. Penicillin V prophylaxis (500 mg bd) should be
commenced post-op and continued for life. Patients should be
educated about the risk of OPSI and seek immediate attention, or start
standby broad-spectrum antibiotics, if they develop a fever with
faintness or rigors. There is a greater risk of severe malaria and longterm malaria prophylaxis (or residence outside a malaria area) should
be advised. Immediately post-splenectomy, there is a risk of
thrombosis because of transient thrombocytosis, or in the case of
haemolytic anaemias, a rise in haematocrit.

Disorders of haemostasis
Abnormal bleeding results from disorders of the:
1. vascular endothelium and platelets (primary haemostasis) →

bleeding into the skin and mucous membranes, or
2. coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways (secondary haemostasis) →
haemorrhage in deep tissues.

Disorders of 1° haemostasis
Vascular purpura: causes include infections, long-term steroid
therapy, and vasculitis. In immunocompromised patients, HSV, VZV,
and arboviruses (O'nyong-nyong, chikungunya) can cause fatal
haemorrhage.
Defective platelet function: can result from drugs (e.g. NSAIDS,
aspirin) and complicate some of the haemorrhagic fevers (e.g. Lassa,
dengue, Marburg, Ebola), alcoholism, hepatic cirrhosis, uraemia,
paraproteinaemias, leukaemias, and myeloproliferative disorders.
Thrombocytopenia: may result from defective production, ↑
destruction/consumption, and splenic pooling.

Onyalai:
means ‘blood blister’ and is a disorder of unknown aetiology that
occurs in central southern Africa. Clinical features: recurrent
haemorrhagic bullae on mucous membranes and less frequently skin,
epistaxis, and cerebral haemorrhage. Mortality is 3-10% due to
haemorrhagic shock and cerebral haemorrhage. Management includes
blood product support.

Management of bleeding due to
thrombocytopenia/defective platelet function
Treat underlying causes of thrombocytopenia.
Desmopressin for uraemic platelet dysfunction.
Anti-fibrinolytics (e.g. tranexamic acid) for mucosal bleeding.
Immune thrombocytopenia can be treated with intravenous
immunoglobulin (0.4 mg/kg over 5 days or 1 mg/kg over 2 days) or
prednisolone (1 mg/kg od for at least 4 weeks).

Platelet transfusions may be necessary for acute bleeding but the
effect only lasts a few days and they may be ineffective if peripheral
consumption is the cause of thrombocytopenia.

Disorders of 2° haemostasis
These can be congenital such as haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency),
haemophilia B (Christmas disease, factor IX deficiency), and von Willebrand's disease (deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor) or
acquired 2° to malabsorption (causing vitamin K deficiency), liver
disease, disseminated intravascular haemolysis (DIC), and snake
envenoming.

Causes of thrombocytopenia
↓ Production

Infections (e.g. typhoid, brucellosis, rubella, mumps, hepatitis C, HIV),
megaloblastic anaemia, alcoholism, marrow infiltration or failure (e.g.
leukaemia, aplastic anaemia, drugs/chemicals)

↑ Peripheral
consumption

Infections (e.g. malaria, trypanosomiasis, dengue and other arboviruses,
EBV, CMV, Marburg virus), hypersplenism, pregnancy, chronic hepatic
disease, DIC, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, ITP, onyalai, acute
viral infection, AIDS, drugs (e.g. quinine, penicillin, valproate),
lymphomas, CLL

Congenital disorders
Clinical features
Haemophilia is sex-linked and boys may present with haemorrhage
after circumcision or other surgical interventions. Other clinical
features include spontaneous bleeding into joints and muscles
(especially if factor level is <1%) which produces crippling arthropathy
and deformity of the limbs. Cerebral haemorrhage and spontaneous
intra-abdominal or upper respiratory tract bleeding may also occur.
The presentation of von Willebrand's disease is usually with bleeding
from mucous membranes (as occurs in disorders of primary
haemostasis) because of the central role of von Willebrand factor in
mediating activation and aggregation of platelets at the site of

vascular damage.

Management
Requires referral to a specialist. NSAIDS and IM injections should be
avoided. Spontaneous musculoskeletal bleeds can be managed with
rest, ice, elevation, analgesia, and gentle physiotherapy once the
acute symptoms have settled. Tranexamic acid 25 mg/kg PO tds can be
helpful for mucosal bleeding. Vaccinate against hepatitis B, screen
regularly for other TTIs if the patient is receiving plasma-based
products.
Desmopressin (0.3-0.4 mg/kg/q12-24 h IV in 50 ml 0.9% saline over 20
mins) raises factor VIII and may be effective in patients with
mild/moderate haemophilia A. Haemophilia B is best treated with
virusinactivated factor IX concentrate though cryosupernatant (or FFP
can be used). Desmopressin is generally effective for von Willebrand's
disease but cryoprecipitate (for factor VIII replacement) and platelet
transfusions may be required in severe cases.

Acquired coagulation disorders
Vitamin K is a co-factor for coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and
the anticoagulant proteins C and S. These factors are produced in
hepatocytes and deficiency of vit K as well as hepatic dysfunction can
lead to coagulopathy. Vit K deficiency results from small bowel fat
malabsorption, biliary or pancreatic dysfunction, starvation, or
prolonged antibiotic use.

Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN):
Neonates are vitamin K-deficient because of poor placental transfer
and ↓ hepatic synthesis. This can lead to bleeding (e.g. intracranial
haemorrhage) in the 1st week of life in premature infants and infants
of mothers on anti-TB therapy, anticonvulsants, or warfarin. Some
advocate the use of vitamin K 10 mg/day PO from 38 weeks' gestation
in patients on anticonvulsants. The treatment of HDN is with
parenteral vitamin K and FFP if there are bleeding complications.
Vitamin K levels are low in breast milk. Breastfed infants may present

with HDN between 1-3 months of age which can be prevented with
vitamin K 1 mg IM at birth.

Vitamin K antagonism:
Warfarin is a competitive inhibitor of vitamin K. Overdose, sepsis, poor
vitamin K intake/absorption, or simultaneous administration of
potentiating drugs may cause bleeding. If the PT is >5x the normal
range and the patient is bleeding, give vitamin K 10 mg IV and fresh
frozen plasma (FFP; 15 mls/kg). Vitamin K permanently reverses
warfarin anticoagulation, but takes >6 h to have an effect. It may take
several weeks to re-anticoagulate, so if it is important to maintain
some anticoagulation, smaller doses (e.g. 0.5-1 mg) may be given with
FFP cover.
Bleeding in liver disease is due to a combination of ↓ clotting factor
synthesis, thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, vitamin K
deficiency, DIC, and dysfibrinogenaemia and should be treated by
parenteral vitamin K, FFP, and cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is low.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):
Results from generalized activation of coagulation pathways in the
vasculature and a cycle of consumption of coagulation factors and
their inhibitors (see box). It may be asymptomatic or associated with
bleeding, skin purpura, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, and
arterial or venous thromboses. There is depletion of all coagulation
factors leading to prolongation of APTT and PT, ↓ fibrinogen and
platelets, and RBC fragmentation on the blood film. Management
consists of treating the underlying condition, careful monitoring, and
supportive care (e.g. blood products) as required. If there are
predominantly thrombotic complications, consider cautious
anticoagulation with IV heparin.

Laboratory issues
This section covers some principles and tests which are useful in
evaluating haematological disease.

The role of primary level health centres in diagnosis and management
of common conditions such as TB and malaria means they usually have
a light microscope. This enables provision of several important
investigations (e.g. WBC and platelet count, RBC morphology,
differential WBC%). However, the microscopist should spend <4 h/day
looking down the microscope if fatigue and poor quality reporting are
to be avoided.

Reducing sources of error in laboratory tests
The following principles can reduce errors in several tests:
Use accurate volumes.
Check date, dilution, and storage of reagents.
Keep instruments and cuvettes clean and grease/dust free.
Keep colorimeters away from sunlight.
Collect capillary or venous blood samples correctly and use
appropriate amount of anticoagulant.
Use correct centrifuge times and speeds.
Filter stains/diluting mixtures; check for particles and use correctly
buffered water.
Run samples in duplicate.
Use clean, dry slides.
Fix slides with water-free methanol when completely dry.
To reduce specific sources of error, consult the laboratory's standard
operating procedures for each test.

Some basic principles of laboratory
management
1. Range of tests
It is generally better to provide a limited number of essential tests

performed to high standards than to provide a wide range of poorquality tests. Test selection should take into account sensitivity and
specificity of tests, as well as positive and negative predictive values
(influenced by the disease prevalence in the local population),
reliability, availability of reagents and consumables, cost, safety,
sustainability, and the skills of laboratory staff.

2. Management and operation of equipment
Involves regular maintenance and appropriate servicing contracts,
availability of manuals, adequate space and light, minimization of dust
and heat damage, and systems for reliable supplies of consumables and
reagents. Laboratory staff using equipment should be appropriately
trained and supervised and the tests they are asked to carry out should
be appropriate for their skills and knowledge.

3. Ensure good quality results
Clinicians and laboratory staff need to have confidence in the accuracy
and reliability of test results. Demonstrating the result of a particular
test is correct is difficult in developing countries because laboratories
lack access to reference samples.
Simple ways of promoting confidence in test results include:
independent re-analysis of selected slides or samples within one
laboratory.
regular exchange of samples with neighbouring laboratories.
including known samples within a batch of tests to demonstrate that
the test is working (e.g. a blood sample known to contain HbS can be
included in each batch of sickle-cell screening tests).
Other factors that are important in ensuring high-quality results are:
appropriate collection and storage of specimens.
use of standard operating procedures for each test.
supervision and regular training of laboratory staff.
maintenance of equipment and good-quality reagents.

4. Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
These are detailed descriptions of laboratory tests designed to prevent
errors and ensure consistent results. They must be designed for the
local situation, kept up-to-date, and adhered to by all staff. SOPs
provide an excellent teaching resource. For each test, they should
include:
the principle of the test and valid reasons for requesting it.
details of the specimen required and how it should be collected.
the equipment and reagents needed, as well as information on how
to maintain, procure, and store them.
the method of the test.
quality control measures and sources of error.
safety considerations.
the procedure to be followed in reporting the results (e.g. units to
be used).

Anaemia
Anaemia is one of the most common medical conditions; prevalence
often reaches 70% in children and pregnant women in developing
countries. Anaemia is present when the haemoglobin (Hb) falls below
the reference level for the age and sex of the individual (see box). A
slight drop in Hb is a physiological response to pregnancy, due to an ↑
in the plasma: red cell ratio. Anaemia in pregnancy is associated with
25-40% of maternal deaths.

Causes of anaemia
Anaemia is due to ↓ red blood cell (RBC) production or ↑ RBC
loss/haemolysis (see Tables 11.1 and 11.2); >1 cause may be present in
an individual. The blood film morphology, degree of reticulocytosis,
and the size of red blood cells (i.e. mean cell volume — MCV,
measured by an automated machine) is helpful in determining the
cause (see box p 459).
The MCV is influenced by the cause of the anaemia, age of the patient,
and the number of reticulocytes (these have a higher MCV than older
erythrocytes).

Reticulocyte count is usually ↑ in RBC loss (unless the patient has
insufficient stores of iron and/or folate to mount a reticulocyte
response) and is ↓ if rbc production is impaired. An indication of the
degree of reticulocytosis is given by the degree of polychromasia seen
on blood film examination, as these younger cells appear ‘bluer’ than
older erythrocytes. For an accurate reticulocyte count, special stains
are required.

Clinical features of anaemia
History
Symptoms of anaemia depend on the rapidity of onset and severity.
Chronic anaemia may be asymptomatic because of a compensatory ↑
in cardiac output. Symptoms are usually non-specific: fatigue,
headache, dizziness, syncope, dyspnoea, palpitations, reduced work or
intellectual capacity. Anaemia may also exacerbate pre-existing
intermittent claudication or angina.
The history is important in determining the cause(s) of anaemia: a past
and family history of anaemia suggests an inherited disorder, such as
haemoglobinopathy or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency. Haemolysis may be suggested by splenomegaly, jaundice,
and dark urine and may be precipitated by infections. Sources of blood
loss can be revealed from questions about bowel habit and colour of
stools, haematuria, and menstrual history. Ask about recent surgery,
childbirth, or trauma. The occupation of the patient may be important
e.g. fishermen may be prone to schistosomiasis and farmers to
hookworm infection. Poor diet may suggest a nutritional deficiency.
Chronic infections such as HIV and TB, renal failure, rheumatoid
arthritis, and some drugs used to treat these conditions, may be
associated with anaemia.

Examination
Clinical assessment is routinely carried out, but has low sensitivity and
specificity for mild — moderate anaemia. Signs include pallor of
mucous membranes or nail beds (sensitivity 50-70% for moderate to
severe anaemia) and signs of a compensatory hyperdynamic circulation
(tachycardia, bounding pulse, cardiomegaly, systolic flow murmur).
Severe, decompensated anaemia leads to shock (i.e. thirst, sweating,

cold extremities, hypotension, and cardiac failure) — these signs
require urgent fluid replacement or, as a last resort, blood transfusion.

Laboratory diagnosis of anaemia
Measure the Hb concentration or packed cell volume (PCV or
haematocrit) of venous or capillary blood. For capillary samples from a
finger or heel prick, the first few drops of blood should be wiped away
to encourage free flow. Avoid squeezing — tissue fluid causes dilution.

Assays
Hb can be measured photometrically (e.g. the haemoglobin-cyanide
technique) in which lysed whole blood reacts with a cyanide solution
to form haemiglobincyanide. Cyanide is hazardous and the method
requires laboratory equipment and skill to produce accurate
dilutions.
The HemoCue Hb301 system is portable, battery-operated and
designed for accurate measurement of Hb in tropical conditions. No
dilution is required — it uses whole blood and is simple and rapid.
The WHO haemoglobin colour scale can be used where no power or
equipment is available and an approximate haemoglobin estimation
is adequate. The colour of a drop of blood on chromatography paper
is matched against a colour scale representing blood of Hb in 2 g/dl
increments (range 4-14 g/dl). The test is simple and cheap, but the
correct paper must be used and it must be read in good light
conditions. Other simple techniques such as the Sahli or Talqvist
methods have been shown to be unreliable in field situations.
Measurement of PCV requires a microhaematocrit centrifuge and
electricity but can be carried out by non-technical staff. Blood is
taken up into capillary tubes directly from a finger prick and
centrifuged for 5 min. This separates cells and plasma and the ratio
of the length of red cell column to the total length of the blood
sample gives the haematocrit.

Iron-deficiency anaemia
This is the most common cause of anaemia worldwide.

Causes of iron deficiency
↑ losses: menstrual, gastrointestinal infections (e.g. hookworm,
whipworm, amoebiasis), peptic ulceration, carcinoma, oesophageal
varices, haemoptysis, haematuria.
↑ requirements: lactation, puberty, infancy.
↓ intake: ingestion of only milk (human or cow's) beyond 6 mths of
age; lack of red meat and/or legumes.

↓ absorption: intake of inhibitors of iron absorption with meals (tea,
milk, phytates present in grain), achlorhydria, malabsorption.
Women have lower iron stores than men and higher losses due to
menstruation, pregnancy, delivery, and lactation. If the mother has
sufficient iron stores, a neonate is born with enough stores to last 6
mths. After this, iron requirements must be met from the diet —
requirements ↑ with rate of growth. Iron deficiency, therefore,
particularly affects children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.

Clinical features:
brittle nails, koilonychia, angular stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia
(Plummer-Vinson syndrome).

Laboratory features:
(see table 11.1,
p 455). Low serum ferritin (<20 mcg/l) is specific
but can be insensitive as it is an acute phase protein. Ferritin >100
mcg/l generally excludes iron deficiency, even in the setting of
infection.

Management
1. Ferrous sulphate 200 mg tds. Expect a Hb rise of 1-3 g/dl after 4
weeks of therapy if iron deficiency is the cause of anaemia (this can
be used as a diagnostic test). Continue iron therapy for 3 mths after
normalization of Hb to replenish stores.
2. Identify and treat the underlying cause and any other haematinic
deficiencies (e.g. folate).
3. Severe anaemia with signs of heart failure may require blood
transfusion.

Notes
Severely malnourished children should not receive iron supplements
until at least 15 days into a feeding programme because of the ↑ risk

of bacterial sepsis and toxicity related to free radicals.
To improve absorption, oral iron preparations should be taken
between meals and with vitamin C (e.g. orange juice, ascorbic acid
tablets).
Oral iron should not be taken with antibiotics or antacids.
Side-effects include GI upset (try lower dose or take with meals),
constipation, green/black stools.

Intravenous iron
Failure to respond to oral iron may be due to malabsorption, poor
compliance, ongoing excessive iron loss, concomitant anaemia of
chronic disease, or an erroneous diagnosis. The first three may
respond to IV iron thereby preventing the need for transfusion. The
first dose should be given slowly because of the risk of adverse
reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, local irritation). IM iron injections are
not recommended because they are painful, there is a risk of
abscess formation, and absorption is unpredictable.

Prevention of iron deficiency
Nutritional advice: eat meat and legumes with vitamin C (e.g.
orange juice) and avoid tea, dairy products, or cereals as these
inhibit iron absorption.
Prophylactic iron supplements: iron supplements have been
recommended for children > 6 mths and pregnant women where
the prevalence of anaemia exceeds 40% because there is a high
probability that iron deficiency contributes to anaemia in these
populations. Supervised weekly/twice weekly supplementation
schedules are effective for prevention of iron deficiency in school
children. However, routine supplementation for children is under
review following studies suggesting that where malaria
transmission is high, routine iron supplementation may be lead to
↑ malarial and other infections.
Anti-helminthics: empiric treatment may be helpful in those with
anaemia where helminth infections are common.

Anaemia of inflammation
Previously termed ‘anaemia of chronic disease’, this anaemia is
associated with chronic inflammatory or malignant disease in which
there is ↓ RBC production, abnormalities of iron utilization, and ↓
erythropoietin levels and/or response. These abnormalities are
mediated by cytokines released as a result of the underlying disease
and by hepcidin, a molecule released by the liver in response to
infection or inflammation that blocks the release of iron from
enterocytes and macrophages (as a bacteriostatic measure).

Causes
Chronic inflammatory disease.
Infectious (e.g. TB, HIV, lung abscess, osteomyelitis, pneumonia,
SBE).
Non-infectious (e.g. RA, SLE, other connective tissue disorders,
sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease).
Malignancy (e.g. carcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma).

Clinical features:
are of anaemia as well as those relating to the underlying diagnosis

Differential diagnosis:
anaemia of chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism,
other microcytic anaemias (see box,
p 459).

Laboratory features:
mild normocytic (occasionally microcytic), normochromic anaemia.
Low reticulocyte count for degree of anaemia. ↓ serum iron and TIBC.
Normal or ↑ serum ferritin levels and a low/normal transferrin
saturation. ↑ markers of inflammation: ESR, CRP.

Management
1. Treat the underlying cause; recombinant erythropoietin may help
anaemia caused by HIV, malignancy, or chemotherapy. Blood
transfusions are a last resort.
2. Anaemia of inflammation may be complicated by another form of
anaemia (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency), renal failure,
bone marrow failure, hypersplenism, or endocrine abnormality.
These must also be addressed.
3. A ferritin <100 mcg/l may suggest concomitant iron deficiency, but
there is little response to oral iron because of the block of iron
uptake in the small bowel. Intravenous iron may be required.

Sideroblastic anaemia
A rare cause of refractory anaemia caused by deranged heme
(haem) biosynthesis in red cell precursors in the bone marrow. This
leads to ↓ Hb production and ineffective haemopoiesis. There are
two forms:
Hereditary: usually X-linked. Associated with moderate
hepatosplenomegaly.
Acquired: either 1° (myelodysplasia) or 2° (myeloproliferative
disorders, alcohol, drugs such as isoniazid).

Laboratory findings:
Ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow (i.e. erythropoietic cells with
iron-containing granules (mitochondria) arranged around the
nucleus in a ring)

Hereditary:
hypochromia, microcytosis, variation in red cell size and shape, low
MCH and MCH(C).

Acquired (myelodysplasia):
dysplastic morphology of leukocytes and erythrocytes on blood film,
macrocytosis, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia may be
present

Management

In severe cases, repeated blood transfusion may be necessary but
this risks iron overload. Splenectomy is contraindicated because of
an associated thrombotic risk. The hereditary type may respond to
high-dose pyridoxine therapy (b p 652). 1° acquired disease may
respond to erythropoietin if available. In 2° disease, treat the
underlying cause.

Macrocytic anaemias
Folate deficiency
Folic acid is present in green vegetables and fruits such as bananas. It
is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum. The body's stores of folate
are limited and clinical deficiency occurs within 2 months. States of
rapid cell division (e.g. growth spurts, pregnancy, haemolytic anaemia)
↑ folate utilization and warrant prophylactic supplementation with 400
mcg folic acid. Reduced dietary intake (e.g. in alcoholics, the
malnourished, and elderly) can also lead to clinical deficiency. Mild
folate deficiency should prompt testing of, or treatment with, vitamin
B12.

Vitamin B12 deficiency
Vitamin B12 is present in meat or dairy animal products. The
absorption of vitamin B12 is complex and requires proteases and
binding factors released in the stomach and combination with intrinsic
factor before uptake in the terminal ileum. Deficiency may result from
a block at any of these steps. Stores of vitamin B12 take 2-3 years to
deplete even after absorption has ceased. Vitamin B12 is essential for
DNA production. The combined metabolic role of vitamin B12 and
folate explains the similarity of the clinical and laboratory features in
both of their deficiency states. There are unique neurological
manifestations of B12 deficiency.

Clinical features
Mild jaundice, glossitis, angular stomatitis, purpura due to

thrombocytopenia, sterility, reversible melanin skin pigmentation, and
increased susceptibility to infections. Neuropathy due to subacute
combined degeneration of the cord (loss of vibration sense,
hypertonia, weakness, and sensory ataxia), psychosis, and dementia
are specific to a lack of vitamin B12.

Laboratory findings
↑ MCV and MCH, normal MCHC, low reticulocyte count, ↓ WCC and
platelets in severe cases. Blood film: oval macrocytes and
hypersegmented neutrophils, basophilic stippling. Slightly ↑ serum
unconjugated bilirubin and LDH because of ineffective erythropoiesis.

Management
Replacement therapy
Folic acid 5 mg PO daily for 4 months; maintenance requirements
depend on underlying disease.
Hydroxycobalamin (vitamin B12) — 6 injections of 1 mg IM over 1-2
weeks and maintenance with 1 mg every 3 months. Oral vitamin B12
therapy can be given if malabsorption is excluded. Anaemia should
resolve over months.

Prophylaxis
Fortification and dietary modification. Consider prophylactic
treatment (e.g. folic acid 400 mcg/day) in pregnancy, severe
haemolytic anaemia, after partial gastrectomy and ileal resection.

Haemolytic anaemias
Haemolysis is the process by which RBCs are broken down and their
components metabolized. This occurs in the reticuloendothelial system
(RES) in the hepatic and splenic sinusoids. Under certain circumstances
(e.g. sickling crisis, severe oxidative damage), red cells may lyse
within the circulation. Red cells normally remain in the circulation for
7120 days but their life span can be shortened due to abnormalities
inside the red cells (e.g. haemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies), in/on
their membrane (e.g. structural defects, deposition of antibody or
complement), or due to mechanisms arising outside the red cell.
The bone marrow is able to compensate up to 5 times the normal
turnover rate given adequate haematinics and a healthy marrow
(compensated haemolysis); if haemolysis exceeds this or there are
haematinic deficiencies or associated disease, anaemia results.

Laboratory findings
↑ Red cell destruction: unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, ↑ LDH, ↑
urinary urobilinogen, ↑ faecal urobilinogen.

↑ Red cell production: polychromasia, reticulocytosis causing ↑ MCV.
Intravascular haemolysis: ↓/absent haptoglobins, ↓ haemopexin,
haem/methaemoglobin, positive Schumm's test (methaemalbumin),
haemosiderinuria, haem/methaemoglobinuria.
Genetic abnormalities of RBCs are extremely prevalent in the tropics
(and to a lesser extent, in temperate zones). Despite the disadvantage
of the homozygous state of some of these abnormalities, they persist
within populations because the heterozygous state provides a degree
of protection against severe malaria. This is either by altering the
environment within the RBC or by conferring resistance to various
stages in the parasite's lifecycle. For example, the presence of HbS (
p 474) confers a 10-fold reduction in risk of severe malaria. Most of
these disorders predispose to a degree of haemolysis.

Acquired haemolytic anaemia
Drug-induced immune haemolytic anaemia: occurs when drugs
bind RBCs (e.g. high-dose penicillin), form new RBC antigens (e.g.
quinidine), or provoke auto-antibodies (methyldopa, mefenamic
acid, L-dopa). A careful drug history (including herbal
preparations) is crucial.
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia: can be caused by cold (IgM) or
warm (IgG) antibodies. They may be 1° (idiopathic) or 2° to
lymphoproliferative disorders, malignancy, autoimmune diseases,
or infections. The direct anti-globulin (Coomb's test) test is
positive because the patient's red cells are antibody-coated.
Warm AHA presents as chronic or acute haemolytic anaemia
with splenomegaly. Management includes treating any
underlying causes. Specific therapy is with steroids (e.g.
prednisolone 1 mg/kg daily) until Hb>10 g/dl, then gradually
reduce. Splenectomy is an option if this fails. Blood transfusion
may be required in severe cases.
Cold AHA presents as chronic anaemia made worse by the cold
and is associated with Raynaud's phenomenon and acrocyanosis.
Management involves treatment of the underlying cause;
steroids are not helpful. Advise the patient to keep warm.

Chlorambucil can be helpful if there is underlying lymphoma.
Splenectomy does not usually help as IgM-coated cells are
removed in the liver.
Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria: is caused by DonathLandsteiner antibody (occurs after mumps, measles, chickenpox,
syphilis, especially in children). This binds red cells after a cold
exposure, causing a complement-mediated lysis which manifests
clinically as haemoglobinuria.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency
G6PD deficiency predisposes to oxidative damage of the RBC and
therefore haemolysis.

Distribution:
G6PD deficiency affects >2 million people with prevalence rates
reaching 25%. Fig. 11.1 shows the world distribution of G6PD deficiency.
Superimposed are three zones where different G6PD variants reach
polymorphic frequencies: zone I (GdMediterranean), zone II
(GdMediterranean, GdCanton, GdUnion, GdMahidol), and zone III
(GdA). These variants have different clinical severities e.g. GdA causes
moderate, intermittent haemolysis whereas GdMediterranean and
GdCanton are more severe.

Clinical features:
G6PD deficiency has sex-linked inheritance, so is much more common
in boys. Most people affected are asymptomatic. The main feature is
of episodic haemolysis which may be severe and intravascular in
nature, particularly in the non-African mutations. Chronic haemolysis
is unusual. In Africa, adults with G6PD deficiency usually only suffer
mild haemolysis but neonates may develop severe hyperbilirubinaemia
and kernicterus. Haemolytic episodes are precipitated by infection
and, to a lesser extent, drugs.

Diagnosis
Between attacks:
Tests of enzyme activity rely on NADPH production and its detection by
direct fluorescence or by reduction of a coloured dye to its colourless
form. These are sensitive, simple, and inexpensive for detecting
hemizygous males and heterozygous women.

During a crisis:
the blood film may show ‘bite’ cells and ‘blister’ cells. Testing for G6PD
activity during a crisis is often unhelpful because haemolysis
eliminates older erythrocytes which have the lowest G6PD activity, so
only the youngest cells (which may have normal G6PD activity) remain.
Following a crisis, testing should be delayed for 6 weeks. In more
severe variants, a greater proportion of erythrocytes have low G6PD
activity so delaying enzyme assays may not be necessary.

Management
Treat underlying infections avoiding medications known to
precipitate haemolysis.
Withdraw any drug that could have precipitated the crisis.
Maintain a high urine output (to prevent pre-renal failure).
Folic acid supplements may be useful if deficiency is possible or if
recurrent haemolytic episodes.
G6PD-deficient babies are prone to neonatal jaundice and, in severe
cases, phototherapy and exchange transfusion are necessary.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency

P.472

Autosomal recessive inheritance. Mainly affects N. Europeans.
Clinical features are variable. May present with neonatal jaundice
or, later, with haemolytic anaemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice.
Diagnosis: blood film shows variable appearances. Definitive
diagnosis is by enzyme assay.
Management: is supportive e.g. folic acid supplements, blood
transfusion where necessary; splenectomy may improve severe
cases.

Red cell membranopathies
These conditions may provide a degree of protection against malaria
due to reduced penetration of the erythrocyte by merozoites.

1. Hereditary spherocytosis
Usually autosomal dominant inheritance. Mainly found in N.
Europeans.
Clinical features are variable: positive family history, mild anaemia
(8-12 g/dl), intermittent jaundice, splenomegaly, pigment
cholelithiasis.
Diagnosis: blood film shows spherocytes, ↑ MCH, ↑ reticulocytes, ↑
lysis in osmotic tests, negative direct antiglobulin test.
Management: folic acid 5 mg/day. Splenectomy for those most

severely affected (see

p 492).

2. Hereditary elliptocytosis
Autosomal dominant inheritance. Usually asymptomatic; haemolysis
may be severe in homozygotes. There may be episodes of jaundice and
moderate splenomegaly following intercurrent infections.
Diagnosis: elliptical red cells, parental studies.
Management: is not usually required; folic acid supplements and
splenectomy may help if haemolysis is significant.

3. South-east Asian hereditary ovalocytosis
Autosomal dominant inheritance. Common in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Philippines, PNG, and Solomon Islands. It is not associated with
haemolytic anaemia.

Sickle cell anaemia

P.474

The sickle gene is common in equatorial Africa (frequency up to 25%),
Saudi Arabia, and S Asia, but less common in the Mediterranean and
the mixed populations of the Americas (frequency 5%). It is due to a
single point mutation in the Hb β-globin gene chain. When
deoxygenated, HbS molecules polymerize into elongated structures
causing erythrocytes to deform and haemolyse. Sickled red cells are
rigid and block the microcirculation in various organs, causing infarcts.
The inheritance of the disease is autosomal co-dominant (i.e. sicklecell trait is due to heterozygous inheritance, HbAS). The trait is
generally asymptomatic. Sickle cell disease occurs with homozygous
inheritance of the gene (HbSS) or co-inheritance of another β-globin
chain disorder such as HbC (see below). Sickle cell disease and G6PD
deficiency may occur together because of the high prevalence of both
conditions in some regions. It provides protection against malaria.

Other sickling syndromes

HbSC disease occurs in west Africa. There is less haemolysis than
with HbSS. Some patients are asymptomatic and therefore may
present only in adulthood. Splenomegaly is a common clinical
finding. Anaemia is less severe than in HbSS but vaso-occlusive
complications (e.g. avascular necrosis, proliferative retinopathy) are
prominent because of the higher haematocrit and may lead to
significant disability in adulthood. Electrophoresis shows two
haemoglobin bands, HbS and HbC. The blood film has more target
cells than in HbSS as well as irregularly contracted cells.
HbSβ0thalassaemia occurs mostly in North Africa, Sicily, and mixed
populations of the Americas. Clinically similar to HbSS, there is a
lower incidence of stroke. The blood film shows hypochromic
microcytic RBCs and target cells. Hb electrophoresis shows HbS,
absence of HbA, and elevated HbA2 and HbF. Definitive diagnosis can
be made by parental studies or DNA analysis.
HbSβ+thalassaemia is the doubly heterozygous condition most
commonly seen in west Africa. The clinical course and degree of
anaemia is milder than HbSS. However, proliferative retinopathy
occurs. Definitive diagnosis with Hb electrophoresis shows HbA 530%, HbS 70-95%.
HbSDPunjab and HbSOArab are as severe as HbSS. HbD occurs in Sikh
and mixed populations.
HbSE, HbSLepore, and HbSHPFH (hereditary persistence of foetal
haemoglobin). All these conditions have a mild clinical course
compared to HbSS.

haplotypes (Arab-India, Bantu, Benin, Cameroon, Senegal) in the

Clinical features of sickle cell anaemia
Severe haemolytic anaemia punctuated by severe pain crises. Young
patients alternate periods of good health with acute crises. Later,
chronic ill health supervenes due to organ damage. Symptoms begin
after 6 months of age as the HbF level declines. The first signs are
often of acute dactylitis due to occlusive necrosis of the small bones of
the hands and feet, resulting in digits of varying length. The long bones
are affected in older children and adults. Anaemia (Hb 6-8 g/dl;
reticulocytes 10-20%) is well-tolerated because of cardiac
compensation and a lower affinity of HbS for oxygen.
The severity of complications depends on a number of factors including
the proportion of non-sickle Hb molecules (e.g. HbF) and the ratio of α

to β chains, which may be modified by concomitant α thalassaemia
trait or conditions affecting β-globin chain production (e.g. Bantu
haplotype is associated with severe disease, whilst Senegalese and
Asian haplotypes are less severe).

Types of crises
Painful vascular-occlusive: frequent and precipitated by infections,
acidosis, dehydration, or hypoxia. Infarcts often occur in the axial
skeleton, lungs, and spleen. Repeated splenic infarction leads to
hyposplenism in adulthood. Crises can involve the CNS (in 7% of
patients) and spinal cord.
Visceral sequestration: due to sickling within organs and pooling of
blood.
Chest: pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, fever, chest pain, tachypnoea,
cough, wheeze. There is often concomitant infection, microvascular
occlusion, and bronchoconstriction. Chest crises can arise during a
painful crisis; patients should be monitored carefully for this
complication, which can be fatal.
Haemolytic: ↑ rate of haemolysis with a fall in Hb. Usually
accompanying a painful crisis. Concomitant G6PD deficiency may
worsen haemolysis.
Aplastic: arrest of red cell production due to infection with
parvovirus and/or folate deficiency. Characterized by a sudden fall
in Hb and reticulocytes; emergency blood transfusion can be lifesaving.

Complications:
pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, stroke, proliferative
retinopathy, cardiomegaly, renal concentrating defect, papillary
necrosis, osteomyelitis (often due to Salmonella spp), skin ulcers,
proliferative retinopathy, priapism, hepatic dysfunction, pigmented
gallstones. Infectious complications are the most common cause of
death. There is a particular risk with encapsulated bacteria (e.g.
pneumococcus, meningococcus, haemophilus) because of

hyposplenism. Survival is linked to socio-economic conditions.

Laboratory findings
Hb 6-8 g/dl, ↑ reticulocyte count, normal MCV. If is MCV low,
consider concomitant iron deficiency or thalassaemia.
Sickle cells and target cells in the blood film; features of splenic
atrophy (e.g. Howell-Jolly bodies) may also be seen.
Screening tests such as the sickle solubility test (e.g. with
dithionate and Na2HPO4) will be positive in the presence of >20%
HbS. These tests are, therefore, also positive in sickle cell trait
and compound heterozygotes. They do not require advanced
laboratory methods and are widely available. False negative
results occur in infants <6 mths old with HbSS because of the
predominance of HbF.
Detection of HbS or other haemoglobin variants, Hb
electrophoresis, iso-electric focusing, and high-performance liquid
chromatography. Some of these tests provide quantification of the
abnormal Hb but are likely to be available only at referral
centres. Expect 30-40% HbS with HbAS (≤35% with concomitant α
thalassaemia), >90% with HbSS.

Sickle-cell disease and pregnancy
Sickle-cell disease predisposes to intrauterine growth retardation,
pre-eclampsia, pre-term labour, in utero foetal death, and ↑ risk
of sickle-related complications in the mother. Sickle-cell trait is
not a problem, except that pyelonephritis is more common.
Early access to antenatal care is important to allow monitoring
for these complications.
Folic acid supplements are essential to prevent megaloblastic
anaemia and birth defects.
Delivery should be non-operative where possible. Consider preoperative exchange transfusion before caesarian section in
complicated pregnancies.
Test neonate for haemoglobinopathy.

Sickle-cell disease and surgery
The incidence of severe complications in sickle-cell patients
undergoing surgery is 30-60%, depending on the procedure.
Equivalent improved outcomes are shown with either top-up or
exchange transfusions. Minor operations can be carried out safely
without pre-op transfusion, providing patients are well-hydrated.

Management of painful crises
Acute pain is the most common reason to seek medical attention:
Exclude other causes of pain.
Keep hydrated — PO, NG, or IV (if other routes have failed).
Keep the patient warm.
O2 therapy is only necessary if hypoxic.
Effective pain relief — can reduce time spent in hospital;
undertreating can lead to drug-seeking behaviour and a painoriented personality.
Parenteral opiates are often required but IM route can cause
abscesses. Monitor the response to analgesia closely; use a pictorial
pain scale in children.
Oral analgesia — NSAIDs are good for bone pain. Give with ulcerprotection (e.g. H2-receptor antagonist or PPI) and monitor renal
function. Oral opioids.
Inhaled NO — risk of subacute combined degeneration of cord with
repeated/prolonged use; may be beneficial in acute chest syndrome.

Management of infections
The most common cause of death in sickle-cell disease.
Treat bacteraemia rapidly: start antibiotics empirically if febrile and
acutely unwell. Greatest mortality from sepsis with encapsulated

organisms; therefore treat empirically to cover S pneumoniae, Hib,
N meningitidis (e.g. ceftriaxone 2 g OD). This has the advantage of
once-daily dosing. Where microbiological diagnosis is possible, send
urine and blood for culture, consider early LP if signs consistent with
meningitis, CXR for suspected pneumonia/chest syndrome.
Proven/suspected meningitis: treat with ceftriaxone for 2 weeks.
Acute chest syndrome: usually triggered by infection. Use antibiotic
to cover S pneumoniae, Hib, mycoplasma, and C pneumoniae (e.g.
cefuroxime and erythromycin). Supportive measures, including
bronchodilators. Consider exchange transfusion if severe. Incentive
spirometry (use of a spirometer to guide deep respirations at regular
intervals) can reduce the risk of acute chest syndrome developing
from painful crisis involving the ribs or back.
Osteomyelitis: ideally confirm organism with cultures, or empirically
cover S paratyphi, E coli, and S aureus (e.g. cefotaxime and
ciprofloxacin). Requires at least 6 weeks of therapy; may require
surgery. Monitor closely for recurrence.
Malaria: non-specific cause of fever and associated with mortality in
sickle-cell disease.
Good supportive care: is essential to prevent other complications.
Monitor fluid balance carefully to prevent overload; treat pain and
hypoxia.

Maintenance of health in sickle-cell disease
Screening: greatest mortality <5 years of age so early diagnosis is
important to ↓ mortality. Selective screening (e.g. pregnant
women, newborn children born to carriers, relatives of those with
the disease) may miss a significant proportion of cases so
universal screening is being implemented in some wealthy
countries.
Education: general health education. Also advise to seek medical
attention early (especially if high fever) and to use clean drinking
water and insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent malaria.
Genetic counselling is important to identify affected relatives and

to plan pregnancy.
Avoid factors precipitating crisis: especially dehydration, hypoxia,
infections, cold environments.
Folic acid supplements: 1-5 mg/day in adults.
Protect against infection: vaccinate against S pneumoniae, Hib,
meningococcus, hepatitis B, influenza. Educate parents/patients
about reduced mortality with compliance to prophylactic
penicillin (125 mg PO bd for children <3 yrs, 250 mg bd thereafter).
Advise lifelong anti-malarial prophylaxis.
Detection of acute splenic sequestration: teach parents of young
children to palpate the spleen soon after diagnosis and to attend
clinic if the child becomes unwell, with an enlarging spleen.
Screening for retinopathy: should be carried out annually from the
age of 15 years.

Hydoxycarbamide:
↓ frequency of crises, chest syndrome, hospitalisations, and
mortality; should be considered for those with painful crises >2-3
times per year. It is difficult to implement in poorer countries
because it requires regular monitoring of FBC to prevent cytopenias
and, ideally, of HbF% for maximal effect. It should be avoided in
pregnancy.

Indications for transfusion in sickle-cell disease
Transfusions are only indicated in sickle-cell disease in specific
circumstances because increasing Hb levels above steady state ↑ the
risk of thrombosis. Indications for transfusion include correction of
blood loss or ↓ production or sequestration (e.g. post-operatively;
during sequestration or aplastic crises; during acute severe illness).

Exchange transfusions:
can be performed to ↓ HbS%, and thus the risk of vaso-occlusion.
Aim for Hb 10 g/dl, Hct ≤32%, HbS ~30%. Exchange blood transfusions
are only beneficial in specific circumstances (e.g. to prevent/↓ risk
of stroke, during pregnancy in women with a past history of severe
complications).

Thalassaemia
β Thalassaemia
Clinically, β thalassaemia is classified as minor (slight ↓ in β globin
chain production, asymptomatic), intermedia (moderate ↓ in β globin
chain production, mild symptoms, occasional transfusion requirement),
and major (total/almost total reduction in globin chain production,
severe symptoms, need for regular transfusion support).

β Thalassaemia minor
Usually heterozygous inheritance. There is palpable splenomegaly and
moderate anaemia during pregnancy. This can cause compensatory
placental hypertrophy and mild intrauterine growth retardation, but
does not significantly affect perinatal mortality.
Diagnosis: mild anaemia (e.g. Hb 9-11 g/dl); blood film shows moderate
anisocytosis, microcytosis (MCV<76 fL, MCH<26 pg), hypochromia with a
few target and tear drop cells. Basophilic stippling may occur. Hb
electrophoresis shows ↑ HbA2(4-6.5%); HbF may also be ↑. Note: iron
deficiency can mask and co-exist with β thalassaemia minor. Testing
for thalassaemia should be delayed until the patient is iron replete.

Management:
includes accurate diagnosis to avoid future treatment of the
hypochromic anaemia with iron, education about thalassaemic
syndromes, and genetic counselling.

β Thalassaemia intermedia
Variable severity from mild haemolytic anaemia to occasional severe
anaemia. In general, splenomegaly, bony expansion, and complications
of iron overload are present, despite only requiring intermittent
transfusion support.

Diagnosis:
features are intermediate between those of β thalassaemia major and
minor.

General management:
As for sickle-cell disease, this involves screening, general health
education (active immunization, clean water sources, hygiene
measures, use of impregnated bed nets to avoid malaria, early
attendance at medical facilities if unwell and especially for febrile
illnesses). Specific measures include:
Folate supplements (5 mg/day for adults).
Transfusion support — if severe anaemia or failure to thrive, or to
suppress erythroid expansion (e.g. in the case of skeletal deformity).
May need to consider iron chelation if ferritin >1000 mcg/l even if
not regularly transfused.
Splenectomy — hypersplenism can ↑ transfusion requirements.
Vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria should be given 2 weeks
pre-operatively (see section on splenomegaly).

β Thalassaemia distribution and pathogenesis
β thalassaemia occurs across southern Europe, Africa, the Middle
East, India, and south-east Asia, and in immigrants from these
areas. It is caused by a variety of mutations of the β globin gene
complex. Excess free β globin chains precipitate as inclusion bodies
in red cell precursors, leading to their destruction. This causes
ineffective erythropoiesis and ↑ splenic uptake of RBCs. There is
compensatory ↑ iron uptake and expansion of erythropoiesis within
haemopoietic tissues including those in extra-medullary sites. This
expansion, together with iron overload and hypersplenism, causes
many of the clinical manifestations.

α Thalassaemia

This arises as a result of a defect (usually deletion) of one or more of
the four α-globin genes. α+ thalassaemia trait occurs due to deletion or
inactivation of a single gene (-α/αα) and is common in Africans. This
does not cause anaemia. α0 thalassaemia trait (-/αα) is more common
in the Asian and Mediterranean regions; there is mild anaemia and the
MCV and MCH are ↓. The blood film shows hypochromic, microcytic red
cells and target cells. Screening and genetic counselling programmes in
high-prevalence areas ↓ the incidence of compound heterozygotes.
Epidemiological studies from Melanesia and Papua New Guinea suggest
that α+ thalassaemia protects against malaria.
Unlike β thalassaemia, more severe forms of α thalassaemia affect the
foetus and neonate because foetal Hb (α2γ2) requires α chains.
Compared to β thalassaemia, α thalassaemia is characterized by
haemolysis rather than ineffective erythropoiesis because the
tetramers of excess β chains (HbH) are more soluble and less
destructive to erythroid cells than α tetramers. HbH inclusions in RBCs
can be detected with specific stains; HbH is detected on Hb
electrophoresis.

HbH disease
HbH is 5-30% with moderate haemolytic anaemia (Hb 7-10 g/dl). The
clinical features often resemble β thalassaemia intermedia. Children
may have growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities; there is a
variable degree of hepatosplenomegaly. Transfusions are not usually
required. Splenectomy may be of benefit.

Hb Bart's hydrops foetalis
The foetus lacks all α genes and is stillborn or dies shortly after
delivery.

β Thalassaemia major
Often due to inheritance of two different mutations (compound
heterogygote) each affecting β globin synthesis. Untreated, most
patients die before 5 years of age from cardiac failure or infection.

Clinical features
Failure to thrive: at 3-6 months of age, when the switch from γ to βchain production should take place; puberty is often delayed and
there may be limited development of sexual characteristics.
Hepatosplenomegaly: due to haemolysis, extramedullary
haemopoiesis, and later in the disease, iron overload from
transfusions. Splenomegaly ↑ blood requirements by ↑ RBC
destruction and pooling.
Bone expansion: as a result of intense marrow hyperplasia; leads to
skeletal deformity, including the characteristic thalassaemic facies
— prominent frontal and parietal bones, maxillary enlargement, and
flattening of the nasal bridge. There is osteoporosis (↑ tendency to
fracture) and bossing of the skull with ‘hair-on-end’ appearance on
X-ray.
Infections: predisposed to infection for a variety of reasons (e.g.
defective splenic function). Severe gastroenteritis caused by Yersinia
enterocolitica is associated with desferrioxamine treatment.
Transmission of viral hepatitis is also increased, probably because of
iron overload and transfusion exposure.
Iron overload: due to transfusion therapy (each 500 ml unit of blood
contains 250 mg of iron) and ↑ iron absorption. Iron accumulation →
liver damage, endocrine damage (failure of growth, delayed or
absent puberty, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), and
myocardial damage. In the absence of intensive iron chelation,
death occurs in the second or third decade, usually from CCF or
cardiac arrhythmias. Clinically apparent abnormalities usually
appear after ~50 units (12 g of iron) but organ damage and skin
pigmentation occur before this.

Diagnosis:
severe hypochromic microcytic anaemia with ↑ reticulocyte count.
Blood film shows many nucleated red cells, tear drop and target cells,
as well as cells of variable morphology and basophilic stippling.
Electrophoresis shows absent HbA, ↑ HbF, and variable HbA2 (often ↑).

Management of β thalassaemia major
General measures: as for sickle-cell disease: screening, health
education, immunization, clean water sources, hygiene measures,
use of impregnated bed nets to avoid malaria, early attendance
at medical facilities if unwell (especially with febrile illnesses).
Transfusion: aims to suppress the patient's own (ineffective)
erythropoiesis, to prevent bony deformity and to normalize
growth. This can be achieved with a regular transfusions of 20
mls/kg packed RBCs every 4-6 weeks to maintain Hb >9.5 g/dl.
Start regular transfusions when growth chart monitoring shows
failure to thrive (usually around 6-12 months of age). Blood should
be matched for ABO, Rh, Kell antigens, and, if possible, filtered to
remove WBCs. If blood requirements exceed 300 mls/kg/year then
the reason for this should be investigated (e.g. hypersplenism,
haemolytic transfusion reactions). Recipients of regular
transfusions should receive hepatitis B vaccination and be
monitored for transfusion-transmitted infections.
Folic acid: give regularly, especially for dietary insufficiency.
Iron chelation: to prevent/treat overload. Commence in infants
after 10-15 units of transfusion. Give desferrioxamine by SC
infusion via a syringe pump driver, 20-40 mg/kg over 8-12 h, 3-7
days per week. Desferrioxamine in high doses, especially in
children, may lead to neutropenia, high tone deafness, loss of
visual acuity, and growth retardation and patients should be
monitored for these complications. Other side-effects include
joint pain and hepatic dysfunction. The oral chelator, deferiprone,
may be considered if parenteral chelation is not possible but it
has also been associated with blood dyscrasias. Give vitamin C
100-200 mg daily with chelation to ↑ iron excretion.
Splenectomy: may ↓the amount of blood required. Delay until >6
years because there is ↑ risk of life-threatening infections postsplenectomy before this age. Immunize against encapsulated
bacteria two weeks prior to splenectomy (see
p 492).
Monitor growth and sexual development: with weight and height
charts as well as clinical examination. Failure to thrive may

indicate ↑ transfusion needs or delayed puberty. If secondary
sexual characteristics are not adequately developed by 16 years
of age, consider testosterone/oestrogen supplements or specialist
referral.

Blood transfusion
Blood transfusion can be life-saving in certain circumstances but it
should only be a last resort and if indicated by clinical features.
Transfusion practice is now very conservative due to increased
awareness of risks of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) and
better understanding of the role of haemodynamic compensatory
mechanisms.
Transfusion-associated risks are high in the developing world because
of the high prevalence of TTIs and lack of quality assurance systems.
To ↓ the use and need for transfusions, it is important to prescribe
according to guidelines and to prevent/treat anaemia effectively e.g.
by controlling malaria and improving nutrition.
In countries where supplies of safe blood are scarce, the following may
guide the decision to transfuse:
Signs of severe heart failure.
Hb <5 g/dl with symptoms.
Hb <4 g/dl in any situation.
Acute blood loss resulting in shock or signs of heart failure despite
infusion of crystalloid or colloid fluids.
Need for emergency major surgery with pre-operative Hb<7 g/dl.
Whole blood is used for most transfusions in developing countries. If
facilities for refrigerated centrifugation of blood are available, then
more efficient use can be made of the blood by splitting it into RBC
concentrates and fresh frozen plasma.

Ensuring blood safety and supply

The objective is to make safe blood available:
Preventing unnecessary transfusions.
Donor-screening and self-exclusion with a health questionnaire
designed to exclude those at high risk of TTIs (e.g. HIV, hepatitis C).
The use of a panel of voluntary, unpaid donors who have repeatedly
tested negative for TTIs and who pass a basic medical test (check
pulse, BP, screen for anaemia and other major illnesses).
Implementation of SOPs for all processes involved in collection,
storage, testing, and administration of blood including adequate
controls and quality assurance (e.g. two grouping techniques should
be used in parallel to prevent fatal ABO-incompatible transfusion
reactions).
Screening all blood for TTIs including HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis,
hepatitis C, and, if appropriate, trypanosomiasis and malaria.
Regular training for those involved in transfusion to ensure
competency and safety.
Use of a closed system allowing collection into blood bags with
anticoagulant, testing and, if necessary, division, or fractionation of
products.
Appropriate storage systems in thermostatically controlled fridges
with back-up power supplies.
A labelling system for blood bags, samples, and patient identification
as well as a procedure of checks at the bedside to ensure the correct
unit is administered to the correct patient.

Administration of blood
Blood should only be removed from the fridge immediately prior to
use. When administering a blood transfusion:
Check the patient details with those of the unit of blood to ensure
the unit has been issued to that patient and is compatible with the
group of the patient.

Give IV via a blood-giving set with a filter.
Keep a record of the volume and units given.
Check pulse, BP, respiratory rate, temperature at start of
transfusion, after 15-30 mins, and every hour during the transfusion.
Observe the patient for the first 10 minutes of a transfusion.
Monitor carefully for signs of fluid overload.

Exchange transfusions
In certain situations, an exchange transfusion is indicated to ↓ the risk
of volume overload or to ↓ the concentration of patients' red cells or
plasma. For example in:
Heart failure 2° to anaemia.
Complications of sickle cell disease.
Haemolytic disease of the newborn.
Hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates.
Specialist advice should be sought regarding details of volumes and
procedures for exchange transfusion.

Transfusion reactions
1. Severe transfusion reaction:
may be due to ABO incompatibility or bacterial contamination of the
unit. Heralded by pain at site of cannula, back/chest pain, agitation,
dyspnoea, nausea, flushing, or hypotension.
Stop the transfusion immediately. Do not flush the giving set.
Ensure IV access, catherize patient, and start fluids to ensure
diuresis.
Monitor renal and liver function, clotting parameters,
haemoglobinuria.
Consider broad-spectrum antibiotic cover after taking blood cultures

and send donor unit for culture (if possible).
Give bronchodilators if wheezing; antihistamine and hydrocortisone
as for allergic reaction.
Laboratory to re-cross match unit, repeat patient's grouping, and
monitor for development of red cell antibodies.

2. Simple febrile and allergic reactions:
If temperature ↑ by >1°C from baseline or the patient develops
urticarial rash or itching, stop the transfusion, check vital signs, give
paracetamol, and, if the patient remains well after 15 minutes, restart
the transfusion at a slower rate.

3. Delayed transfusion reaction:
usually occurs 5-10 days post-transfusion and is due to sensitization to
red cells following previous transfusions or pregnancy. Clinical features
include fever, hyperbilirubinaemia, and anaemia. Samples should be
taken for grouping, direct Coombs' test, repeat cross-matching, and
antibody screening and results compared with a pre-transfusion
sample.

Acute leukaemias
Characterized by an excessive proliferation of immature
haematopoietic cells (blasts) in the peripheral blood. Without
treatment, acute leukaemias have a median survival of months.
Although they are aggressive disorders, chemotherapy may be
curative; this is not the case with indolent haematological
malignancies which may not require treatment at diagnosis but are
incurable with standard chemotherapy.

Diagnosis:
of acute leukaemias relies on analysis of blood and bone marrow
samples to establish the origin of the malignant cells and associated
genetic abnormalities.

Treatment:
is with cycles of chemotherapy. Normal haematopoietic tissue is also
affected by chemotherapy, leading to anaemia, neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia, so red cell and platelet transfusions may be
required and there is a significant risk of infection.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
is a common malignancy in children with peaks at 2-5 yrs and >40 yrs.
Poor prognostic markers include age <1 or >10 yrs and >30 yrs,
presenting white cell count >50 ×109/l, and certain cytogenetic
abnormalities. Clinical features include bone pain, lymphadenopathy,
hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, haemorrhage, and infections.

Acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML)
has a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. Clinical features are similar
to ALL except that in Africa 10-25% of all patients and ~30% of boys may
present with a solid tumour (chloroma) e.g. in the orbit or skin. Gum
hypertrophy and DIC are features of AML sub-types. Risk factors include
exposure to benzene, radiation, and previous cytotoxic therapy. Poor
prognosis is associated with age >55 years, poor general state of
health, and specific cytogenetic abnormalities.

Causes of changes in white cell counts:
↑ cell count

Physiological (e.g. Pregnancy).
Acute bacterial infections (e.g. Pneumonia, UTI, abscess).
Tissue damage, inflammation, stress (e.g. Burns, dka).

Lymphoproliferative disorders.
Monocytosis >1.0 × 109/l
Rarely — chronic bacterial infection (e.g. TB).
Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.
Eosinophilia >0.5 × 109/l
Helminth infections (e.g. Hookworm, hydatid disease,
schisosomiasis — values >3 × 109/l are likely to be due to
katayama fever, strongyloidiasis).
Allergic/skin conditions (e.g. asthma, atopy, drugs, vasculitis,

psoriasis) reactive to leukaemia/lymphoma, connective tissue
disease.
Convalescence from viral or other infections, especially in
infants.

↓ cell count
Neutropenia <2.0 × 109/l
Acute infection (e.g. Dengue fever, overwhelming bacterial
sepsis).
Certain chronic infections (e.g. visceral leishmaniasis, AIDS).
Bone marrow failure or drugs (e.g. chloramphenicol).
Peripheral consumption (e.g. hypersplenism, Felty's syndrome).
Miscellaneous (ethnic, familial, cyclic, chronic, idiopathic).
Lymphopenia <1.5 × 109/l
Common in many acute infections (e.g. TB, hepatitis, pneumonia).
Drugs (e.g. corticosteroids).

Lymphoproliferative disorders
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)
A heterogeneous group of tumours of B and T cell origin. Low-grade
lymphomas run an indolent course but are incurable, while high-grade
lymphomas are more aggressive initially but long-term cure is
achievable. High-grade NHLs are more common in Asia and Africa and,
in Africa, are associated with malaria. Features include:
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, night sweats,
pruritis, fever, pancytopenia.

Burkitt's lymphoma (BL):
is a highly aggressive subtype of NHL. It occurs in malaria-endemic
areas, is related to EBV infection, and is the most common childhood
cancer in tropical Africa. BL has a male predominance with a peak
incidence at 4-7 years but it may also occur in individuals with HIV. It

classically involves the jaw but can occur in any extranodal site.
Steroids or a single dose of IV cyclophosphamide may provide symptom
control and a short-lived remission but intensive chemotherapy is
needed to achieve a 70% cure rate.

Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL)
HL is a malignant proliferation of B lymphocytes. It is more common in
males, with two peaks in young adulthood and middle age. There are
geographical variations in sub-types; nodular sclerosing HL
predominates in published studies, but in developing countries, the
mixed cellularity sub-type is more common and has been linked to EBV
exposure. HL usually presents as painless lymphoadenopathy and 7080% of cases are curable with standard radio/chemotherapy.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
CLL is characterized by proliferation of mature but dysfunctional
lymphocytes and predisposition to infections and, less commonly,
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The M:F ratio is 2:1 and median age
60. There tends to be a lower incidence in tropical than in temperate
regions where it is the most common form of leukaemia. CLL may
present with incidental lymphocytosis (5 - >100 ×109/l),
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or signs of bone marrow
failure. Treatment consists of chemotherapy (e.g. chlorambucil) and
transfusions/antibiotics, as required.

Multiple myeloma (MM)
MM is due to infiltration of the bone marrow with malignant plasma
cells. The incidence is higher in the islands of the Pacific, the
Caribbean, and Africa than in more wealthy countries. Clinical
features include bone pain, pathological fractures, osteopenia,
hypercalcaemia, renal failure, and bone marrow failure with anaemia,
infection, and bleeding. Definitive treatment results in a median
survival of 3-5 years. Supportive treatment includes analgesia,
transfusions, and bisphosphonates.
P.490

Myeloproliferative disorders
A group of disorders characterized by proliferation of haemopoietic
stem cells. These cells retain their ability to differentiate, resulting in
an excess of mature cells of predominantly one lineage. The disorders
share systemic symptoms such as malaise, night sweats, fever, and
weight loss. Splenomegaly, gout, and pruritis on contact with water
are not uncommon. These disorders are not curable, but may be
associated with long survival if treated. Transformation to acute
leukaemia or to marrow fibrosis occurs in a minority.

Polycythaemia
Primary polycythaemia (polycythaemia rubra vera) is associated with
PCV >56% in females, >60% in males, neutrophilia and/or
thrombocytosis, gout, splenomegaly (in 60%), and, less commonly, a
thrombotic event. 2° causes should be excluded. Treatment is by
venesection to ↓ PCV to <45%, aspirin (75 mg od), and
hydroxycarbamide for those at high risk for thrombosis, or with
concomitant thrombocytosis. The median survival is ~15 years in nonelderly patients.

Thrombocytosis
Reactive causes of thrombpocytosis include blood loss, iron deficiency,
infection, inflammation, hyposplenism, and malignancy. Essential
thrombocythaemia is characterized by platelet count persistently >500
× 109/l without an underlying reactive cause. Half of patients are
asymptomatic, 25% have splenomegaly and 25% have a history of
arterial thrombosis at diagnosis. Platelet function may be abnormal in
a minority, especially in those with platelets >1000 × 109/l. Young
patients without risk factors for atherosclerotic disease do not require
treatment. Patients at risk of thrombosis should be given low-dose
aspirin and some may need hydroxycarbamide to ↓ platelet count.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)
Due to uncontrolled proliferation of mature myeloid cells; >95% of

cases have the Philadelphia chromosome. The median age at diagnosis
is 50-60 years, but CML can present in childhood. Most patients present
in the chronic phase, which is often asymptomatic. CML inevitably
progresses to a blastic phase that is clinically indistinguishable from
acute leukaemia and characterized by the proliferation of increasingly
abnormal and dysfunctional cells leading to significant morbidity,
reduced response to therapy, and death. In chronic phase,
hydroxycarbamide 1-2 g should ↓ WCC to normal levels; new
treatments may induce remission in the chronic phase. With
treatment, the chronic phase may last 2-5 years. The disease is only
curable with an allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

Splenomegaly

P.492

The spleen is a major site of antigen presentation and platelet
reservoir. Splenic macrophages remove damaged or old red cells. The
spleen enlarges as a result of over-activity of any of these processes.
The high prevalence of chronic infection/infestation as well as
haemolytic anaemias in the tropics means that splenomegaly is a
common physical sign. Splenomegaly may produce abdominal
distension, discomfort, and early satiety. The spleen is recognized
clinically by its movement with respiration, enlargement towards the
right iliac fossa, the presence of a notch, and the fact that the upper
margin cannot be palpated. Massive splenomegaly may be associated
with blood pooling and cytopenias.

Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS)
HMS occurs very commonly in areas with high malaria transmission,
especially in adults who have taken up residence in the endemic area.
HMS is due to polyclonal lymphoid activation because of an abnormal
immune response to malaria. HMS is difficult to distinguish from
lymphoproliferative disorders, hepato-splenic schistosomiasis, and
visceral leishmaniasis, which may co-exist in the same territory. Once
other causes have been excluded (see box), HMS is a likely diagnosis.
Antimalaria prophylaxis (e.g. proguanil 100 mg/day) for at least 6
months may result in significant regression of the spleen, supporting

the diagnosis.

Splenectomy
Indications for splenectomy include trauma, haemolytic anaemia,
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and (infrequently) for the
purpose of diagnosis. Post-operatively, especially in the first few years,
there is an ↑↑ risk of sepsis (overwhelming post-splenectomy infection
— OPSI) from encapsulated bacteria, particularly Streptococcus
pneumoniae. The risk of OPSI is ~0.5% per year, and even with good
resources, mortality is ~50%, so prevention is essential. If possible,
elective splenectomy should be delayed until >5 years of age because
of increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria. Pneumococcal,
meningococcal, and H influenza b vaccinations should preferably be
given at >2 weeks pre-op; if splenectomy is unplanned, they should be
given >2 weeks post-op; reimmunization for pneumococcus should be
repeated every 5 years. Penicillin V prophylaxis (500 mg bd) should be
commenced post-op and continued for life. Patients should be
educated about the risk of OPSI and seek immediate attention, or start
standby broad-spectrum antibiotics, if they develop a fever with
faintness or rigors. There is a greater risk of severe malaria and longterm malaria prophylaxis (or residence outside a malaria area) should
be advised. Immediately post-splenectomy, there is a risk of
thrombosis because of transient thrombocytosis, or in the case of
haemolytic anaemias, a rise in haematocrit.

Disorders of haemostasis
Abnormal bleeding results from disorders of the:
1. vascular endothelium and platelets (primary haemostasis) →

bleeding into the skin and mucous membranes, or
2. coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways (secondary haemostasis) →
haemorrhage in deep tissues.

Disorders of 1° haemostasis
Vascular purpura: causes include infections, long-term steroid
therapy, and vasculitis. In immunocompromised patients, HSV, VZV,
and arboviruses (O'nyong-nyong, chikungunya) can cause fatal
haemorrhage.
Defective platelet function: can result from drugs (e.g. NSAIDS,
aspirin) and complicate some of the haemorrhagic fevers (e.g. Lassa,
dengue, Marburg, Ebola), alcoholism, hepatic cirrhosis, uraemia,
paraproteinaemias, leukaemias, and myeloproliferative disorders.
Thrombocytopenia: may result from defective production, ↑
destruction/consumption, and splenic pooling.

Onyalai:
means ‘blood blister’ and is a disorder of unknown aetiology that
occurs in central southern Africa. Clinical features: recurrent
haemorrhagic bullae on mucous membranes and less frequently skin,
epistaxis, and cerebral haemorrhage. Mortality is 3-10% due to
haemorrhagic shock and cerebral haemorrhage. Management includes
blood product support.

Management of bleeding due to
thrombocytopenia/defective platelet function
Treat underlying causes of thrombocytopenia.
Desmopressin for uraemic platelet dysfunction.
Anti-fibrinolytics (e.g. tranexamic acid) for mucosal bleeding.
Immune thrombocytopenia can be treated with intravenous
immunoglobulin (0.4 mg/kg over 5 days or 1 mg/kg over 2 days) or
prednisolone (1 mg/kg od for at least 4 weeks).

Platelet transfusions may be necessary for acute bleeding but the
effect only lasts a few days and they may be ineffective if peripheral
consumption is the cause of thrombocytopenia.

Disorders of 2° haemostasis
These can be congenital such as haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency),
haemophilia B (Christmas disease, factor IX deficiency), and von Willebrand's disease (deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor) or
acquired 2° to malabsorption (causing vitamin K deficiency), liver
disease, disseminated intravascular haemolysis (DIC), and snake
envenoming.

Causes of thrombocytopenia
↓ Production

Infections (e.g. typhoid, brucellosis, rubella, mumps, hepatitis C, HIV),
megaloblastic anaemia, alcoholism, marrow infiltration or failure (e.g.
leukaemia, aplastic anaemia, drugs/chemicals)

↑ Peripheral
consumption

Infections (e.g. malaria, trypanosomiasis, dengue and other arboviruses,
EBV, CMV, Marburg virus), hypersplenism, pregnancy, chronic hepatic
disease, DIC, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, ITP, onyalai, acute
viral infection, AIDS, drugs (e.g. quinine, penicillin, valproate),
lymphomas, CLL

Congenital disorders
Clinical features
Haemophilia is sex-linked and boys may present with haemorrhage
after circumcision or other surgical interventions. Other clinical
features include spontaneous bleeding into joints and muscles
(especially if factor level is <1%) which produces crippling arthropathy
and deformity of the limbs. Cerebral haemorrhage and spontaneous
intra-abdominal or upper respiratory tract bleeding may also occur.
The presentation of von Willebrand's disease is usually with bleeding
from mucous membranes (as occurs in disorders of primary
haemostasis) because of the central role of von Willebrand factor in
mediating activation and aggregation of platelets at the site of

vascular damage.

Management
Requires referral to a specialist. NSAIDS and IM injections should be
avoided. Spontaneous musculoskeletal bleeds can be managed with
rest, ice, elevation, analgesia, and gentle physiotherapy once the
acute symptoms have settled. Tranexamic acid 25 mg/kg PO tds can be
helpful for mucosal bleeding. Vaccinate against hepatitis B, screen
regularly for other TTIs if the patient is receiving plasma-based
products.
Desmopressin (0.3-0.4 mg/kg/q12-24 h IV in 50 ml 0.9% saline over 20
mins) raises factor VIII and may be effective in patients with
mild/moderate haemophilia A. Haemophilia B is best treated with
virusinactivated factor IX concentrate though cryosupernatant (or FFP
can be used). Desmopressin is generally effective for von Willebrand's
disease but cryoprecipitate (for factor VIII replacement) and platelet
transfusions may be required in severe cases.

Acquired coagulation disorders
Vitamin K is a co-factor for coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and
the anticoagulant proteins C and S. These factors are produced in
hepatocytes and deficiency of vit K as well as hepatic dysfunction can
lead to coagulopathy. Vit K deficiency results from small bowel fat
malabsorption, biliary or pancreatic dysfunction, starvation, or
prolonged antibiotic use.

Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN):
Neonates are vitamin K-deficient because of poor placental transfer
and ↓ hepatic synthesis. This can lead to bleeding (e.g. intracranial
haemorrhage) in the 1st week of life in premature infants and infants
of mothers on anti-TB therapy, anticonvulsants, or warfarin. Some
advocate the use of vitamin K 10 mg/day PO from 38 weeks' gestation
in patients on anticonvulsants. The treatment of HDN is with
parenteral vitamin K and FFP if there are bleeding complications.
Vitamin K levels are low in breast milk. Breastfed infants may present

with HDN between 1-3 months of age which can be prevented with
vitamin K 1 mg IM at birth.

Vitamin K antagonism:
Warfarin is a competitive inhibitor of vitamin K. Overdose, sepsis, poor
vitamin K intake/absorption, or simultaneous administration of
potentiating drugs may cause bleeding. If the PT is >5x the normal
range and the patient is bleeding, give vitamin K 10 mg IV and fresh
frozen plasma (FFP; 15 mls/kg). Vitamin K permanently reverses
warfarin anticoagulation, but takes >6 h to have an effect. It may take
several weeks to re-anticoagulate, so if it is important to maintain
some anticoagulation, smaller doses (e.g. 0.5-1 mg) may be given with
FFP cover.
Bleeding in liver disease is due to a combination of ↓ clotting factor
synthesis, thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, vitamin K
deficiency, DIC, and dysfibrinogenaemia and should be treated by
parenteral vitamin K, FFP, and cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is low.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):
Results from generalized activation of coagulation pathways in the
vasculature and a cycle of consumption of coagulation factors and
their inhibitors (see box). It may be asymptomatic or associated with
bleeding, skin purpura, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, and
arterial or venous thromboses. There is depletion of all coagulation
factors leading to prolongation of APTT and PT, ↓ fibrinogen and
platelets, and RBC fragmentation on the blood film. Management
consists of treating the underlying condition, careful monitoring, and
supportive care (e.g. blood products) as required. If there are
predominantly thrombotic complications, consider cautious
anticoagulation with IV heparin.

Laboratory issues
This section covers some principles and tests which are useful in
evaluating haematological disease.

The role of primary level health centres in diagnosis and management
of common conditions such as TB and malaria means they usually have
a light microscope. This enables provision of several important
investigations (e.g. WBC and platelet count, RBC morphology,
differential WBC%). However, the microscopist should spend <4 h/day
looking down the microscope if fatigue and poor quality reporting are
to be avoided.

Reducing sources of error in laboratory tests
The following principles can reduce errors in several tests:
Use accurate volumes.
Check date, dilution, and storage of reagents.
Keep instruments and cuvettes clean and grease/dust free.
Keep colorimeters away from sunlight.
Collect capillary or venous blood samples correctly and use
appropriate amount of anticoagulant.
Use correct centrifuge times and speeds.
Filter stains/diluting mixtures; check for particles and use correctly
buffered water.
Run samples in duplicate.
Use clean, dry slides.
Fix slides with water-free methanol when completely dry.
To reduce specific sources of error, consult the laboratory's standard
operating procedures for each test.

Some basic principles of laboratory
management
1. Range of tests
It is generally better to provide a limited number of essential tests

performed to high standards than to provide a wide range of poorquality tests. Test selection should take into account sensitivity and
specificity of tests, as well as positive and negative predictive values
(influenced by the disease prevalence in the local population),
reliability, availability of reagents and consumables, cost, safety,
sustainability, and the skills of laboratory staff.

2. Management and operation of equipment
Involves regular maintenance and appropriate servicing contracts,
availability of manuals, adequate space and light, minimization of dust
and heat damage, and systems for reliable supplies of consumables and
reagents. Laboratory staff using equipment should be appropriately
trained and supervised and the tests they are asked to carry out should
be appropriate for their skills and knowledge.

3. Ensure good quality results
Clinicians and laboratory staff need to have confidence in the accuracy
and reliability of test results. Demonstrating the result of a particular
test is correct is difficult in developing countries because laboratories
lack access to reference samples.
Simple ways of promoting confidence in test results include:
independent re-analysis of selected slides or samples within one
laboratory.
regular exchange of samples with neighbouring laboratories.
including known samples within a batch of tests to demonstrate that
the test is working (e.g. a blood sample known to contain HbS can be
included in each batch of sickle-cell screening tests).
Other factors that are important in ensuring high-quality results are:
appropriate collection and storage of specimens.
use of standard operating procedures for each test.
supervision and regular training of laboratory staff.
maintenance of equipment and good-quality reagents.

4. Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
These are detailed descriptions of laboratory tests designed to prevent
errors and ensure consistent results. They must be designed for the
local situation, kept up-to-date, and adhered to by all staff. SOPs
provide an excellent teaching resource. For each test, they should
include:
the principle of the test and valid reasons for requesting it.
details of the specimen required and how it should be collected.
the equipment and reagents needed, as well as information on how
to maintain, procure, and store them.
the method of the test.
quality control measures and sources of error.
safety considerations.
the procedure to be followed in reporting the results (e.g. units to
be used).

Global blindness
The WHO estimates that 36 million people worldwide are blind
(corrected visual acuity of less than 3/60 in the best eye). This figure is
increasing every year because the world's population is both increasing
and ageing. By far the majority live in the developing world. A further
124 million people have low vision (corrected acuity of less than 6/18
to 3/60).
Cataract is the most common cause of blindness worldwide, with an
estimated 17 million blind people and over 100 million eyes justifying
cataract surgery because of severe visual impairment. In 1999, an
estimated 10 million cataract operations were performed worldwide. It
is calculated that as many as 30 million cataract operations need to be
performed annually if cataract blindness is to be controlled in the next
10 years.
With improvements in hygiene and primary health care, particularly in

Asia, degenerative conditions, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy,
and age-related macular degeneration are the fastest growing causes
of blindness. However, trachoma and vitamin A deficiency continue to
be major problems in the most deprived communities.
Trachoma and onchocerciasis are blinding ocular infections responsible
for approximately 5% of all blindness. Both occur in poor communities.
Blindness can be prevented through relatively simple, low-cost
interventions including the use of antimicrobials. Vitamin A deficiency
is a major cause of blindness in children and again occurs in poor
communities.
Visual loss due to refractive errors, particularly myopia, is an
increasing problem especially in Asia. Refraction followed by the
appropriate spectacle correction will restore sight, but for people
living in isolated communities, the ‘refractionist’ and spectacles are
often either unavailable or unaffordable.
These five diseases (cataract, trachoma, onchocerciasis, vitamin A
deficiency, and refractive errors) are all avoidable (preventable or
curable) and constitute at least 70% of all cases of blindness
worldwide.

Presenting symptoms of eye disease

P.526

People attending with an eye complaint are usefully considered
according to the main symptom:
Visual loss: they cannot see in the distance with one or both eyes.
Red painful eye(s): eye pain or discomfort, with or without a history
of trauma.
Inability to read: reduced near vision, despite good distance vision.
This is due to presbyopia after 40 years of age.
Other symptoms: e.g. watering eyes, flashing lights.

Visual loss

Examination
Measure the visual acuity without and with a pinhole.
Examine the cornea and pupil with a torchlight.
After dilating the pupil, examine the optic disc and retina with an
ophthalmoscope.

Refractive errors
There are five different types of refractive errors:
Myopia — short-sightedness, causing poor distance vision but good
near vision.
Hypermetropia — long-sightedness, giving difficulty with near vision
in young people. Uncommon in patients <40 yrs old.
Astigmatism — due to a different refraction in two axes of the eye.
Aphakia — severe hypermetropia due to removal of the lens.
Presbyopia — poor accommodation leading to difficulty with reading
and near vision after 40 years. It is treated with reading spectacles
that usually have a strength of between +1.00 and +4.00 dioptres. In
patients under 50 years, +1 to +2 is sufficient. Patients >70 will
require +3 to +4.
Most people with poor distance vision due to refractive errors have
myopia. Myopia can be diagnosed as follows:
The distance vision improves with a pinhole.
Near vision is good, despite poor distance vision.
Myopia can be corrected with minus lenses. In the absence of a trained
refractionist, the following method will usually give an acceptable
spectacle correction. If you have trial lenses available, test one eye at
a time. Start with a -1 lens and gradually increase the stength by steps
of -1, measuring the visual acuity with every lens. When increasing the
power does not lead to any further improvement, choose the minimum
power that will give the best visual acuity. Repeat the process for the

other eye.
Aphakia is becoming less common as most cataract operations include
insertion of an intraocular lens. It can be corrected with a +11.0
dioptre lens.

Testing visual acuity
All eye patients must have their vision measured. Any opacity of the
lens or cornea, or damage to the central retina or optic nerve will
reduce the visual acuity.
Only the distance acuity is measured; near vision will always be
reduced in older patients who do not have reading glasses. Distance
vision is measured at 6 metres. Each eye is tested individually, using
the patient's own distance glasses, if they have any. The patient
stands 6 metres from the chart and covers one eye. Literate
patients read out the letters, starting at the top. Illiterate patients
use an ‘E’ chart, indicating if it is pointing left or right, up or down.
Each line on the chart is labelled with a number. The top line is 60,
the second is 36, etc. These numbers indicate the distance at which
that line can be read by a normal eye. The 3rd line on the chart can
normally be read at 24 metres, so if a patient can only read this line
at 6 metres, the visual acuity is 6/24. The 6 identifies the distance
at which the line was read and the 24 identifies the distance at
which that line would be read by a normal eye. Normal vision is 6/6.
In practice, most people can do most of their normal daily activities
with a vision of 6/18.
If patients cannot see the top line at 6 metres, bring them closer. If
they can read it at 3 metres, the acuity is 3/60. If they cannot see
the top line, ask them to count your fingers, see your hand move, or
see light. If they have no perception of light, it is probable that the
eye is permanently blind and no treatment will restore vision.
Sometimes the visual acuity is reduced because the patient needs
glasses. You can partially overcome a refractive error by using a
pinhole. To make a pinhole, take some dark card (e.g. exposed X-ray
film) and with a hot 21G needle, make a hole in the centre of the
circle. The patient holds the film and looks through the hole in the
middle. If the vision improves, the eye has a refractive error.

Cataract
Cataracts cause a gradual, progressive, and painless decrease in visual
acuity. Because they progress very slowly, most patients who are blind
from cataract never come to an eye clinic, since they accept their
blindness as normal for their age. Elimination of cataract blindness
requires community involvement to change attitudes and reduce
barriers that block access to eye services.

Diagnosis:
When complete, cataracts can be seen as a white opacity in the pupil,
while younger cataracts give a grey-white appearance to the pupil.
Examination of the fundus of the eye with an ophthalmoscope, after
dilation of the pupil, shows an opacity in the red reflex with
obscuration of fundus detail due to the lens opacity. The pupil reaction
to light is normal in an uncomplicated cataract.

Management:
There is currently no way to prevent cataracts forming. The only
treatment is surgery to remove the lens and replace it with an
artificial intraocular lens (IOL). Surgery is usually performed under
local anaesthesia. Following surgery, 80-90% of eyes should be able to
see 6/18 or better. The patient may then need corrective spectacles to
obtain optimal vision.

Corneal opacity
Diagnosis:
There is a white opacity on the cornea, which usually prevents a clear
view of the pupil. This may follow a corneal ulcer, injury, or be due to
trachoma, vitamin A deficiency, or leprosy. Most corneal scars are
preventable by primary prevention (e.g. vitamin A deficiency) or by
good management of the original condition (e.g. corneal ulcer).

Management:
If both eyes have severe visual loss, then a corneal graft or optical
iridectomy may be considered to try and improve the vision. Specialist
care and very good follow-up are essential to obtain reasonable
results.

Glaucoma
May be acute with a red painful eye, or chronic with gradual
progressive loss of peripheral vision due to optic nerve damage. The
patient is unaware of the loss of sight until visual acuity is impaired,
which occurs only after most of the optic nerve has been destroyed.

Diagnosis:
of chronic glaucoma is difficult. Detecting peripheral visual field loss
requires expensive and complex equipment. Measuring IOP is simpler,
but unreliable, as many patients with an elevated IOP do not have
glaucoma, and some patients with glaucoma have a normal IOP. The
most reliable method of diagnosis is observation of characteristic
changes in the optic disc (increased size of the optic cup). However,
this requires expertise.

Management:
of glaucoma consists of lowering the IOP with filtration surgery or
lifelong eye drops (e.g. timolol 0.25% bd). Treatment prevents
progression and preserves the remaining vision, but does not improve
vision, so patients who are already blind should not be treated.

Red eye
History and examination
Ask about any known cause, particularly any injury.
Measure the visual acuity.
Carefully examine the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, pupil with a
torch.

Injuries to the eye
First ask about any injury to or foreign body into the eye.

Corneal or conjunctival foreign bodies (FB)
The history is usually straightforward. The FB may be obvious or you
may need to evert the upper eyelid to check the conjunctiva for
objects scratching the cornea each time the patient blinks.
To remove the FB:

Lie the patient flat.
Apply local anaesthetic drops e.g. lidocaine 4% to the conjunctiva.
Light the eye with a torch so that the FB is easily visible.
Loupe magnification is useful.
Lift off the FB with the corner of a thick piece of paper, or carefully
with a needle.
Give an antibiotic eye ointment or drops and eye pad for 1 day.

Corneal abrasion
This occurs when trauma removes some corneal epithelium. There is
sudden severe pain and photophobia. To confirm the diagnosis, apply
fluorescein which stains the cornea where there is no epithelium.
Treat with an antibiotic eye ointment or drops until the pain has gone
and the epithelium is completely healed.

Hyphaema
If there is a severe blunt injury (e.g. hit in eye by stone/fist), then
bleeding may occur inside the eye. A blood level (hyphaema) may be
visible between cornea and iris. This will usually resolve over a few
days with rest. Avoid aspirin, as this may lead to further bleeding. If
the eye is painful, give acetazolamide 250 mg qds for 3-7 days to lower
the IOP and topical prednisolone 0.5-1.0% drops qds to reduce the
inflammation. If the hyphaema has not resolved after 5 days, consult
an eye specialist.

Penetrating eye injury
A penetrating injury (involving the full thickness of cornea or sclera) is
very serious. Common causes include thorns, and splinters when
chopping firewood. Be very careful examining the eye as pressure may
aggravate the injury. Gently apply an antibiotic eye drop (not
ointment), put an eye pad over the eye, and refer the patient to a
specialist immediately. Systemic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 750 mg BD)
may reduce the 730% risk of an intraocular infection. If immediate

referral is not possible, then conservative treatment with antibiotics
and an eye pad is probably better than a non-eye surgeon ‘having a
go’.

(See table on

p 531).

Conjunctivitis
1. Infective conjunctivitis
Infection or inflammation of the conjunctiva is common in the tropics.
Important causes and a way of differentiating them are given in Table
13.3.

Diagnosis:
irritation of the eye with discomfort but normal vision. The eye is red
with increased discharge. Severe disease may produce swelling of the
eyelids (chemosis).

Management:

give an antibiotic eye ointment or drops e.g. chloramphenicol 0.5-1%,
initially q2 h, then qds for 5-7 days. Do not pad the eye.

2. Ophthalmia neonatorum
A specific conjunctivitis occurring in the first 4 weeks of life, usually
due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis (see
p 22).
The lids are very swollen and covered with pus. Untreated, gonococcus
infection causes a rapid progression with complete destruction of the
cornea and permanent blindness.

Management:
give appropriate systemic and topical antibiotics which will be
effective against local strains of Neisseria (see
p 609). Most cases of
ophthalmia neonatorum may be prevented by irrigating the eyes of all
newborn babies with 2.5-5% povidone-iodine solution immediately
after delivery.

3. Chlamydial conjunctivitis (trachoma) — see
below.
4. Epidemic haemorrhagic conjunctivitis
A highly contagious viral conjunctivitis usually due to enteroviruses.
After a 1-2 day incubation period, multiple petechial haemorrhages
occur. Most patients recover quickly.

Management:
give an antimicrobial agent e.g. povidone-iodine 1.25% 1 eye drop qds,
to help reduce transmission and reassure the patient.

5. Allergic conjunctivitis
Children and young adults may develop a chronic allergic
conjunctivitis (vernal conjunctivitis). There is severe itching/irritation

with a mucus discharge, sometimes with swelling and pigmentation
around the cornea.

Management:
treatment with topical steroids is effective but has serious sideeffects. If possible, children with severe disease should be seen and
treated by an eye specialist. In milder cases, parents should be
reassured that the condition does not lead to loss of sight and is
usually self-limiting — children ‘grow out of it’. Symptoms may be
reduced by bathing the eyes with cold clean water.

Corneal ulcers
A corneal ulcer may occur spontaneously or follow a corneal abrasion.
There are many causes — the main ones are summarized in Table 13.4.

Diagnosis:
there is usually severe pain, a watery discharge, and blurred vision.
There is redness around the cornea, and the cornea is cloudy, often
with a localized white or grey opacity, which stains with fluorescein. In
severe cases, there may be a fluid level of pus inside the eye
(‘hypopyon’). If the ulcer is caused by infection, the organism may be
identified by gram stain and culture of a scraping from the edge of the
ulcer.

Management:
depends on the cause, and is summarized in Table 13.4.

Snake venom ophthalmia
Spitting elapids have evolved modified fangs which enable the snake
to eject a spray of intensely irritant venom into the eyes of an
aggressor, causing intense pain, conjunctivitis, corneal erosions (and

occassionally anterior uveitis). Secondary bacterial infection of
corneal erosions may cause permanent scarring and blindness.

Management:
Wash venom from affected eye or mucous membranes with copious
amounts of water. Apply topical chloramphenicol or tetracycline
ointment. 0.1% adrenaline eyedrops relieve the pain.

Uveitis
Inflammation of the uvea may involve both anterior uvea (iris and
ciliary body) and posterior uvea (choroid). Causes include: infections
(e.g. leprosy, onchocerciasis, toxoplasmosis, TB, syphilis) and systemic
diseases (e.g. certain types of arthritis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's,
inflammatory bowel disease). However, most cases, particularly of
anterior uveitis, have no known cause, and multiple investigations are
unnecessary.

Anterior uveitis (iritis, iridocyclitis)
Clinical features:
the pain of iritis varies from mild to severe and is associated with
photophobia and often some blurring of vision. Blood vessels around
the margin of the cornea (the limbus) are dilated. The iris constricts
and adheres to the front of the lens (posterior synechia), making the
pupil irregular. These synechiae can lead to secondary glaucoma and
cataract. When the pupil is dilated, adhesions may be seen before they
break, leaving iris pigment on the front of the lens. Pus collecting in
the anterior chamber can be seen with a slit lamp microscope.

Management:
dilate the pupil to break any posterior synechiae (cyclopentolate 1% or
atropine 1%); give anti-inflammatory agents (prednisolone 0.5-1.0%
drops) to reduce the inflammation.

Posterior uveitis
Clinical features:
presents with visual loss because of involvement of the overlying
retina. Not usually painful but a severe attack may cause discomfort. A
white inflammatory lesion may be seen in the retina. Once the
inflammation has settled, characteristic scars occur with pigment
atrophy and hypertrophy.

Management:
requires treatment of cause.

Acute glaucoma
If the IOP increases suddenly over a few hours, the eye becomes red
and very painful with severe loss of vision. Acute glaucoma is unusual
in people <50 years. It may occur spontaneously or as a complication of
a completely white cataract. The cornea appears hazy and the pupil is
semi-dilated and does not react to light. The IOP is very high.

Management:
give acetazolamide 500 mg stat and then 250 mg qds. Refer to an eye
specialist since urgent surgery is usually required.

Trachoma
Trachoma is a chronic conjunctivitis caused by infection with
Chlamydia trachomatis, serotypes A, B, and C. Inflammation from
active infection leads to scarring of the upper conjunctiva and tarsal
plate causing the eyelashes to turn in and scratch the cornea,
producing ulceration, scarring, and blindness.

Transmission:
the disease occurs particularly in poor dry areas of the world in which
there is inadequate water supply and poor community sanitation. The
classic trachoma environment can be described as:
•

Dry:

lack of water

•

Dirty:

lack of sanitation

•

Discharge:

lack of personal hygiene

Transmission of trachoma from child to child, and child to mother
occurs through:
•

Flies:

flies go from individual to individual

•

Fingers:

direct contact with ocular discharge

•

Family:

within the family, child to child

Clinical features and diagnosis:
see the 5-point WHO grading system opposite. TF and TI are found
mainly in pre-school children; TS, TT, and CO occur more commonly in
women than men, starting at around the age of 15 and gradually
increasing in prevalence.

How to examine the eye for trachoma:
use good light (sunlight or strong torch) and x2-2.5 magnification.
Examine each eye separately.
Look for trichiasis (either inturned lashes or previously removed
eyelashes). Push upper lid upwards slightly to expose lid margins.
Check cornea for opacities.
Check inside upper eyelid by everting it. Ask the patient to look
down; gently take hold of eyelashes between thumb and first finger
of left hand, and evert the upper eyelid using a glass rod or similar

instrument in the right hand. Steady the everted lid with left thumb
and examine the conjunctiva for follicles, intense inflammation, and
scarring.

Management
azithromycin 1 g PO as single dose (20 mg/kg if <45 kg) or
for pregnant women, erythromycin 500 mg PO bd for 7 days or
tetracycline 1% topical ointment both eyes bd for 6 weeks.
Studies are still evaluating the merits of treatment of whole
communities vs. just affected individuals. Entropion and trichiasis will
require surgery.

Prevention:
of trachoma is considered under the acronym SAFE (see box opposite).
Control requires first identifying a community with blinding disease.
This can be done using the grading scheme and a survey of 1-10 year
old children for TF and TI, and women over the age of 15 yrs for TT. A
prevalence of TF in excess of 20%, or TT in excess of 1%, would identify
a community with severe disease.

Trachoma grading
(see colour plate 25)
Signs must be clearly seen in order to be considered present.
Grading is important for community prevalence surveys to decide
whether mass treatment is warranted.
Normal: the normal conjunctiva is pink, smooth, thin, and
transparent. Over the whole area of the tarsal conjunctiva, there
are normally large deep-lying blood vessels that run vertically.
The dotted line in colour plate 25(a) shows the area to be
examined.
Trachomatous inflammation — follicular (TF): the presence of five
or more follicles in the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Follicles are
round swellings that are paler than the surrounding conjunctiva,

appearing white, grey, or yellow. Follicles must be at least 0.5 mm
in diameter (see colour plate 25b).
Trachomatous inflammation — intense (TI): pronounced
inflammatory thickening of the tarsal conjunctiva that obscures
more than half of the normal deep tarsal vessels. The conjunctiva
appears red, rough, and thickened. There are numerous follicles,
which may be partially or totally covered by the thickened
conjunctiva (see colour plate 25c).
Trachomatous scarring (TS): the presence of scarring in the tarsal
conjunctiva. Scars are easily visible as white lines, bands, or
sheets in the tarsal conjunctiva. They are glistening and fibrous in
appearance. Scarring, especially diffuse fibrosis, may obscure the
tarsal blood vessels (see colour plate 25d).
Trachomatous trichiasis (TT): at least one eyelash rubs on the
eyeball. Evidence of recent removal of inturned eyelashes should
also be graded as trichiasis (see colour plate 25e).
Corneal opacity (CO): easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil.
The pupil margin is blurred viewed through the opacity. Such
corneal opacities cause significant visual impairment (worse than
6/18 vision) and, therefore, visual acuity should be measured (see
colour plate 25e).

Specific eye conditions

Vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia
Xerophthalmia is due to vitamin A deficiency, which may lead to
corneal ulceration and blindness, particularly in association with
measles infection. It is a medical emergency, as severe vitamin A
deficiency has a high mortality — see
p 648. Patients with acute
corneal lesions should be referred, whenever this is possible, to a
hospital for treatment of their general condition as well as their eye
disease.

Ocular leprosy
Leprosy (
p 448) can affect the eyelids, cornea, or pupils by
damaging the nerves to the eye or by causing iritis.

Eyelids:
nerve damage may occur during a type 1 reaction and cause an
inability to close the eye (lagophthalmos), with resulting corneal
exposure, ulceration, scarring, and blindness. In the acute stages,
systemic treatment of the leprosy reaction may restore nerve
function.

Management:
requires protection of the cornea when the patient is asleep by
applying ointment and strapping the upper eyelid to the cheek. If
severe and permanent, or if there is evidence of corneal ulceration, a
tarsorrhaphy will be required to protect the cornea. This consists of
sewing together the lateral third of the upper and lower eyelid
margins.

Cornea:
ophthalmic nerve damage results in corneal anaesthesia. The patient
does not blink as much as usual and may be unaware of minor trauma
to the cornea, causing ulceration, scarring, and blindness.

Management:
prevent by early recognition of the problem and educating the patient
to protect the cornea during the day by blinking and at night, with
ointment and strapping of the eyelid to the cheek. If these measures
fail, then a permanent lateral tarsorrhaphy is required.

Pupil:
there may be acute anterior uveitis with a red painful eye, and small
irregular pupil. This may occur as part of an erythema nodosum
leprosum reaction. Leprosy also causes a chronic low-grade anterior
uveitis in which the pupil is very small and irregular and will not
dilate. The eye is usually white in chronic iritis.

Management:
in acute anterior uveitis, the pupil should be dilated immediately and
the patient kept on atropine and topical steroids. In chronic anterior
uveitis, it is important to keep the pupil dilated and to maintain the
patient on mydriatic eye drops for life.

HIV infection and the eye

P.540

The ocular manifestations of HIV infection include:
Herpes zoster ophthalmicus.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva.
CMV retinopathy.

Herpes zoster
Presents initially with pain over one side of the head and face followed
by a vesicular rash. The eyelids are always involved and there may be
a keratitis and iritis, which can cause raised intraocular pressure. The
disease is often blinding in HIV-positive patients with corneal
involvement and severe intraocular inflammation. Treatment is with
oral aciclovir 800 mg 5×/day. This is sometimes the first manifestation

of HIV infection, and all patients should receive counselling and an HIV
test.

Squamous cell carcinoma
of the conjunctiva appears as a raised irregular white lesion, usually
on the temporal conjunctiva, that grows to invade the fornices, lids,
and cornea. Treatment is by wide surgical excision where possible.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Infection of the retina is the most common opportunistic infection of
the eye and a major cause of blindness in AIDS patients. It only occurs
when the CD4 count is low (<100), so it occurs late in the disease.
Where HAART is available, CMV retinitis has become rare. The
appearance is one of red haemorrhages and pale necrotic tissue. It is
bilateral in 50% of cases. It is slowly progressive and can destroy the
whole retina. Treatment, if available, is with
ganciclovir 5 mg/kg IV q12 h for 2-3 weeks, then 5 mg/kg/day, or
foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV q8 h for 2-3 weeks, then 90-120 mg/kg/day.
However, both have severe side-effects and are expensive.
Alternatively, ganciclovir can be given by weekly intravitreal
injection. This requires much lower doses, with little risk of systemic
toxicity, but does carry a risk of endophthalmitis and the
inconvenience of weekly intraocular injections.

Onchocerciasis and the eye
Onchocerciasis is an infection of the skin and eye due to the filarial
worm Onchocerca volvulus (see
p 572). Inflammation can affect the:
cornea, causing acute punctate keratitis which may lead to
sclerosing keratitis and corneal scars.
iris, causing anterior uveitis and posterior synechiae.
choroid and retina, causing chorioretinitis, night blindness, and
chorioretinal atrophy (most marked temporal to the macula).

optic nerve, causing optic neuritis and secondary optic atrophy.
No treatment can restore vision that has been lost to onchocerciasis,
but annual treatment with ivermectin prevents eye damage in
endemic areas.

Introduction
Skin function and failure
The skin is a large and visible organ at the interface of the body and
the environment. When it fails, management is based on enhancing or
supplementing its functions. These functions are:
1. Protection from the environment: effective barrier function relies on
the skin's capacity to repair itself when damaged. Extensive skin
damage e.g. burns or toxic epidermal necrolysis, may be fatal.
2. Perception: loss of protective sensation including pain may lead to
injury or pressure ulcers. Disease itself may cause discomfort/pain.
3. Thermoregulation: control of cutaneous circulation and sweating
prevents potentially fatal cooling and overheating.
4. Communication and display: healthy skin contributes a ‘look good,
feel good’ factor; disease may cause stigma and worsen marriage
prospects.

Common problems
Skin disease is among the top 3 reasons people seek health care. The

most common problems are:
Infestations and infections.
Absent skin: burns and ulcers.
Sexually transmitted infections affecting skin or mucosae.
Dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis, and bullous disorders.

Management of skin disease with limited
resources
Management of skin disease in low-resource settings is a world apart
from the therapies available in private sector or developed world
clinics. However, ‘high tech’ treatments are not essential to good skin
care, which may be delivered using locally available resources at low
cost.
Care of the skin demands attention to barrier function and, for this,
most locally available emollients are usually satisfactory. It is essential
to prevent further damage to diseased skin, both from infection (by
keeping wounds clean and ensuring good hygiene) and from trauma.
‘Off-loading’ the skin is important in preventing pressure ulcers. Simple
measures prevent further skin damage: well-fitting shoes help prevent
foot trauma and hats provide protection from the sun; a blanket may
provide warmth, shade, and cover from flies; and injury from fire may
be reduced by education and safer cooking devices.
Consider the social aspects of skin disease which may significantly
affect quality of life. Stigmatization may occur as a result of skin
disfigurement, the unpleasant odour of chronic ulcers, albinism,
leprosy, or the cutaneous manifestations of AIDS. The discomfort and
disfigurement caused also fuel a market in ineffective remedies; this
and overusage of cosmetics contribute to the cycle of poverty.

Fig. 14.1 Human head (P. capitis ), body (P. humanus), and pubic
(P. pubis) lice; and the mite causing scabies (Sarcoptes scabei).

Infections of the skin
See Chapter 5.

Skin infestations
Arthropod contact or bites are the most common cause of itch. Papular
urticaria and vasculitic lesions may result in sensitive individuals, and
heavy infestations may occur in the immunocompromised. An itchscratch cycle contributes to pyoderma, management of which must
include treatment of the underlying infestation. Treatment of
household contacts is also an essential part of effective management.
Bites from gnats, blackfly, and midges are best prevented by thick
clothing.

Lice
There are three species of medical importance: the head louse
(Pediculus capitis), body louse (P. humanus), and pubic or crab louse
(Phthirus pubis). The body louse is also important as the vector of
epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazeki), relapsing fever (Borrelia
recurrentis), and trench fever (Bartonella quintana).
Transmission is by close personal contact, increased by poverty,
overcrowding, and poor hygiene. The lice pierce the skin to take a
blood meal, injecting saliva and defecating at the same time. A rash
occurs due to a hypersensitivity reaction to the saliva. Blue macules <1
cm in diameter occur during pubic louse infection possibly due to
injection of an anticoagulant. Body lice live in the host's clothes,
passing onto the skin only to take a blood meal. Head and pubic lice
infest the skin directly. Eggs (‘nits’) are laid and firmly glued to hairs.

Management:
For body lice the focus is on laundering. Lice are easily dislodged and
readily lay eggs in bedding, towels, and clothing. Clean clothes in a
very hot wash, then iron the seams; or dust clothes with 1% malathion
powder. For head and pubic lice, apply 0.5% malathion liquid on the
affected parts, allow to dry naturally, and remove by washing after 12
h. (Alternatives to malathion in case of resistance: carbaryl 0.5-1%;
permethrin 5%; phenothrin 0.2-0.5%.) Detailed information on head lice
detection and management is available at

www.health.wa.gov.au/headlice.

Scabies
Sarcoptes scabiei is transmitted by close personal contact. The female
burrows into the epidermis to lay eggs; burrows can be seen as 0.5-1.5
cm long irregular tracks. Sensitization to mite faeces and saliva occurs
within a few weeks of 1° infestation. Re-infestation results in almost
immediate irritation and, in some cases, a generalized urticaria.
Itchy papules and linear burrows occur in a symmetrical distribution,
particularly in the finger webs and on the flexor surface of the wrists
(frequent hand washers have fewer lesions on the hands). Other sites
commonly include elbows, axillae, genitalia (particularly scrotum),
periumbilicus, and breasts. Head infestation is common in infants, but
unusual
in older age groups. Macules and pustules occur. Scratching results in
2° bacterial infection. Severe, hyperkeratotic (‘Norwegian’) scabies is
seen in immunocompromised (e.g. HIV +ve) patients.

Management:
Apply malathion 0.5%, permethrin 5% cream, or benzylbenzoate 25% to
the body and leave on for 24 h before washing off. Malathion and
permethrin are applied twice, 1 week apart. Benzyl benzoate is
applied on 3 consecutive days and may require repeated applications
to penetrate the crusts. Sulphur 2-8% creams may be used to soften the
crusts (also safe in babies). Ivermectin 200 mcg/kg PO stat is an
alternative for scabies complicating other skin diseases, for Norwegian
scabies, or for communities such as prisons. All clothing worn the
previous day, and the day of the treatment, and all bedding, must be
washed. Iron the laundry or dry for an hour in a hot dryer. Place any
un-washable items into a closed plastic bag for 2 weeks. The eggs will
hatch in about 10 days, but scabies aren't able to live away from
human skin for more than 24 h, so the mites will die. Asymptomatic
infection is common, so treat the whole household. Note: itching may
persist for some days but does not usually indicate treatment failure.

Trombiculid mites (Chiggers)
Chiggers are the larvae of trombiculid mites, several species of which
may cause an itchy dermatitis. The tiny larvae assemble at the tips of
grass stems and other foliage and then attach to passing mammals and
birds including humans, feeding on the host tissues. Typically, an itchy
dermatitis occurs within a few hours of walking through long grass or
other vegetation. Application of repellents e.g. diethyltoluamide
(DEET) to skin and clothing will help prevent chigger attack.

Ulcers
Ulcers represent the absence of surface layers of skin. They invite
infection and require a greatly enhanced blood supply for repair.
Reasons for delay in healing may be local (in the wound), general ill
health, and/or lack of access to care.

Neuropathic (pressure) ulcers
are due to lack of awareness of prolonged compression of blood supply.
They occur in the sick and elderly, and in patients with neurological
deficits such as paraplegia, diabetic neuropathy, or leprosy. They are
preventable with a little knowledge about who is at risk, frequent offloading, and by encouraging movement. Skin care with washing and
emollients and gentle movement is always beneficial since it restores
barrier function, reduces entry points for bacteria and irritants, and
switches off repair requirements. The skin that is in repair mode is
hugely demanding on its blood supply.

Venous ulcers
are a consequence of impaired venous emptying, often due to damage
to venous valves by trauma or thrombosis. Risk factors include obesity,
upright posture, advanced age, and immobility. They occur less
commonly in those who frequently sit on the ground in a cross-legged
posture or actively use their legs. Their prevalence is increasing.

Arterial ulcers
occur due to peripheral vascular disease. Risk factors are those for
atherosclerosis, including smoking, diabetes, and advanced age.

Tropical ulcer
is a term given to ulcers of the lower leg which commonly occur in
persons (especially young men) exposed to the humidity and mud of a
prolonged rainy season. They are attributed to mixed aerobic and
anaerobic bacterial infection of superficial wounds, usually following
minor trauma. A small, round, painful ulcer forms which may then
spread rapidly, even exposing the underlying muscles and tendons. The
patient may be febrile. After a few weeks, the ulcer stops spreading as
the inflammation reduces and the pain diminishes. Some ulcers heal
spontaneously leaving a scar; others become chronic and may persist
for years.

Sickle cell disease
contributes to ulceration of the leg, especially of the ankle after mild
trauma, often beginning in early adolescence.

Other causes
of ulcers include Buruli ulcer, cutaneous diphtheria, cutaneous
leishmaniasis, leprosy, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections,
non-venereal treponematoses, actinomycosis, chronic osteomyelitis,
dracunculiasis, trypanosomal chancre, and the eschars of rickettsiae
and anthrax.

Management of ulcers
Management must address the specific causes of ulceration. In addition
there are some general principles for management of all ulcers.
Ulcers need covering and should be kept moist. Remove any pus or
slough and clean with 1-6% hydrogen peroxide or dilute sodium
hypochlorite solution (≤0.5% available chlorine) at each dressing

change. Apply clean dressing using short pieces of bandage or wellwashed linen that do not completely encircle the leg. Wet dressings
with saline or impregnate with honey or coconut oil, and cover to
prevent evaporation;
this will soften crusts and encourage healing. Hydrocolloid dressings
may be available in some settings. Avoid adherent dressings that
remove with them any new epidermis growing in the ulcer base.
Beware evaporation during dressing changes, which may cool the ulcer
below the optimum temperature for cellular repair. Wash and apply
emollient to surrounding skin.
Blood supply to the ulcer should be maintained and optimized by
offloading pressure and encouraging exercise. When the arterial
system is healthy, veins must be emptied by elevation and
compression. Treat any deep infection (surface contamination does not
require antibiotics). Optimize other conditions contributing to poor
healing (see box).
Most other causes of delayed healing despite adequate care are to be
found in the ulcer. Foreign bodies, pus, necrotic tissue, and sequestra
must be removed and oedema treated. Dead tissue can be excised
without pain. Maggots, if present, are a cheap and effective way of
debriding an ulcer. Green bottle (Lucilla sericata) maggots are
commercially available in many places; packaged in tea bags their
secretions are an effective debriding agent. Large or chronic ulcers
may require excision and/or grafting. Local application of Aloe
barbadensis (Aloe vera) promotes wound healing but, in general,
herbal remedies should be avoided in the absence of evidence for their
efficacy.

Tropical ulcer:
in addition to above measures, give antibiotics to eradicate infection
e.g. procaine benzylpenicillin 0.6-1.2 g IM daily for 3-7 days.

Conditions contributing to poor ulcer healing
Malnutrition.
Vitamin or mineral deficiency.

Anaemia.
Systemic infection.
Steroid therapy, cancer, chemotherapy.
Diabetes mellitus.
Heart, renal, or liver failure.
Immune dysfunction.
Immobility.
Smoking.
Depression, anxiety, and belief in sorcery.

Buruli ulcer
Buruli ulcers are a chronic necrotizing skin disease of tropical forest
areas caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. Cases have
been reported in east, central, and west Africa, Asia, central and south
America, Papua New Guinea, and Australia. The mode of transmission
is unknown but possibilities include inoculation by minor trauma,
biting insect, or contaminated aerosols of water.
Lesions start as a painless nodule which may be itchy. Some resolve
spontaneously, but many enlarge and break down to form a relatively
painless ulcer with edges that may be undermined for 5-15 cm.
Mycolactone, a bacterial exotoxin, contributes to necrosis and ulcers
may spread rapidly to become very large and disfiguring. There are
few systemic signs (although lymphadenopathy and lymphoedema may
occur). Complications include 2° bacterial infection and tetanus.
Without treatment, many lesions eventually slowly heal after a few
years, often causing severe scarring, contractures, and deformities.

Diagnosis
is based on a typical clinical picture and/or demonstration of acid fast
bacilli in the ulcer's base.

Management

relies on encouraging early presentation in endemic areas, surgical
excision (where possible), and prevention/management of
complications. Chemotherapy with anti-mycobacterial agents is
generally ineffective. Completely excise nodule if recognized early. At
the ulcer stage, treat any 2° infection, irrigate ulcer with saline, and,
if resources allow, excise all diseased tissue and cover the wound by
skin grafting. To prevent severe contractures every effort should be
made to maintain a position of function by massaging with oils and
keeping the legs extended for standing and the arms flexed for feeding.

Blistering disorders
Causes of blisters include burns, acute dermatitis from irritants or
allergens, infections (e.g. impetigo, fungal infections of the foot),
drugs, autoimmune diseases (pemphigus, pemphigoid, dermatitis
herpetiformis), genetic disorders (e.g. epidermolysis bullosa),
porphyria.

Pemphigus
causes fragile, intra-epidermal blisters in adults, usually also affecting
the mucosa of the mouth. An increased incidence of its most
superficial form (foliaceious pemphigus) has been described in a
community in Brazil, occurring as an autoimmune response to insects.
Treatment is with high-dose steroids (prednisolone 60-100 mg daily),
which may gradually be reduced as the blistering resolves.

Pemphigoid
causes sub-epidermal blisters, frequently partially blood-filled. It is
seen most commonly in the elderly. It responds well to systemic
steroids; mild cases with only a few blisters may respond to topical
steroid creams.

Dermatitis herpetiformis
causes an itchy papules and vesicles over extensor surfaces and is
associated with coeliac disease. Treatment is with dapsone.

Porphyria cutanea tarda
is rare. It causes skin fragility (blisters from minor knocks) and blisters
in light-exposed sites. Causes include liver disease (including chronic
hepatitis C infection) and alcohol abuse.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome
is a severe form of erythema multiforme complicated by severe
blistering of skin and mucosae including the mouth, eyes, and
genitalia, and accompanied systemic features such as fever. The target
lesions of erythema multiforme may be evident, but in its most severe
form, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN, associated with a positive
Nikolsky sign) causes widespread blistering of the skin. Other
complications include diarrhoea, anterior uveitis, pneumonia, renal
failure, and polyarthritis, A wide variety of triggers may be
responsible, including drugs (e.g. sulphonamides; thiacetazone in HIV
+ve patients), streptococcal infections, viral infections (e.g. HSV Orf),
malignancy, and some systemic diseases (e.g. SLE). Management: Stop
any potential drug trigger. Nurse patients as for extensive burns, with
careful attention to fluids, nutrition, and prevention of 2° bacterial
infection. In the absence of good nursing care and attention to fluids,
the mortality from fluid loss is high. The role of steroids is
controversial: they reduce progression but also significantly increase
the risk of infection. IV immunoglobulins are sometimes used but large
controlled trials are required to confirm their benefit. TEN is
associated with a high mortality.

Drug eruptions
Adverse reactions may follow both conventional drugs and alternative
remedies. Drug rashes tend to be symmetrical and are commonly
erythematous, urticarial, purpuric, or ischaemic. Exfoliation or
vesiculation are rare. Drugs are an important cause of Stevens-Johnson
syndrome. A fixed drug eruption occurs at the same (fixed) site
following a particular drug (e.g. sulphonamides, tetracyclines). It may
blister within a few hours of intake and it leaves an annular pigmented
mark.

In general, most drugs take >5-10 days to initiate a reaction unless the
drug has previously caused a reaction or an infection has ‘primed’ the
body to a medicine (e.g. cough mixture or antibiotics). Drug eruptions
occur more commonly in HIV/AIDS.

Management of drug eruptions
Ask the patient about previous reactions to drugs.
Stop all drugs likely to have caused the reaction.
Give prednisolone 1 mg/kg if the reaction is acute and severe.
In less severe cases, it is possible to restart the drugs one by one to
identify the causative drug, but there is a high risk of morbidity and
only essential drugs should be restarted. Do not reintroduce drugs
that have caused anaphylaxis,TEN, or severe exfoliative dermatitis.

Rashes
Basis of rashes
The skin varies in thickness and quantity of hair or sebaceous glands.
Rashes affecting only one component of the skin will have a
distribution which reflects this component (e.g. hair follicles in
folliculitis or dermatomes in shingles).
The lesions differ according to the depth of the inflammation. Near
the surface it causes vesiculation and scaling, while deep dermal or
subcutaneous inflammation results in nodule formation.
The rate of development is determined by the type of inflammatory
response. Erythema, wheals, and blisters are more acute; white cell
infiltration, purpura, and pustules take longer; while ischaemic
necrosis and exfoliation are more chronic responses.
The distribution of the lesion may be typical — see Fig. 14.2.
Endogenous rashes tend to be symmetrical; in contrast, a biting
insect produces asymmetric lesions. Unlike the rashes of 2° syphilis,
the site of the 1° chancre is not influenced by host symmetry. Fungus

infections tend to be more obvious on one side of the body, whereas
psoriasis is usually exactly symmetrical.

Pityriasis rosea
Pityriasis rosea is a viral infection of young adults. It begins with a
single annular erythematous and scaling lesion on the trunk known as a
herald patch; this is followed within a week by an erythematous and
usually pruritic rash of the trunk with variable centrifugal spread. The
rash resolves spontaneously within a few weeks and does not recur.

Lichen planus
The rash of lichen planus is composed of itchy, flat-topped, shiny,
purplish papules which may have fine white ‘Wickhams's striae’ on the
surface; lacy white lesions may also occur on the buccal mucosa. It
usually resolves spontaneously over months; topical steroids may
reduce irritation.

Dermatitis (eczema)
An inflammatory reaction of the skin that may occur as a (usually
asymmetrical) response to an external irritant or as a symmetrical
endogenous response to a stimulus (atopic eczema).

Irritant dermatitis:
The most common form of dermatitis, generally affecting the hands
following contact with industrial irritants at work. It also affects the
feet of barefoot agricultural workers. The skin is dry and unsupple with
deep cracks which may become infected. Previously damaged skin is
more susceptible to irritants.

Contact allergic dermatitis:
Sensitization to an allergen, normally over months or years, results in
the onset of dermatitis within hours of subsequent exposure to the
allergen (e.g. cosmetics, nickel in zips, buttons, stainless steel
watches, or jewellery, food, plants, medicines, metals). Irritant
dermatitis is a risk factor for contact dermatitis. Patch testing
identifies the specific allergen: suspected allergens are applied to
normal skin, usually on the back, and examined at 48 h for redness,
swelling, or vesiculation that identifies an allergen.

Atopic eczema:
Atopy, which includes asthma and hayfever, is due to an IgE response
to foods or environmental agents. Atopy affects up to 15% of children
in developed settings, possibly due to altered immunity as a result of
increased environmental hygiene and fewer helminths; or increased
pollution; or changes in housing encouraging house dust mites. In
atopic eczema, the skin is very itchy and dry and it becomes damaged
by repeated scratching. 2° bacterial infection frequently occurs,

associated with regional lymphadenopathy.

Psoriasis
The classic lesion of psoriasis is a sharply demarcated silvery plaque,
often more active at the edge with a clear centre. Initially, or as
plaques resolve, they may be atypical (e.g. scaleless, exudative, red).
Plaques occur most commonly on knees, elbows, scalp; also navel,
natal cleft, hairline. Lesions in flexures have decreased scale and are
red, shiny, and liable to crack and macerate. Distinct forms occur:
Guttate psoriasis: small, poorly defined lesions (often red with little
silvery scale) that occur across the whole body; often in children
after streptococcal sore throat or vaccination.
Palmar/plantar psoriasis: lesions develop deep cracks and sterile
pustules; nails often involved. Differentiate from fungal infection.
Generalized pustular psoriasis: fever, arthropathy, bright red
erythema followed by the development of multiple pustules. Can
occur after stopping prolonged potent steroid therapy. Resolves
spontaneously.
Psoriatic arthritis occurs in ~10% patients. 5 patterns are recognized: a
small joint arthritis of hands and feet with distal interphalangeal joint
involvement (most common); seronegative rheumatoid-like arthritis;
large joint mono- or oligo-arthritis; spondylitis; and arthritis mutilans.

Management of dermatitis (eczema)
Eliminate or avoid known irritants or allergens.
Avoid soaps (these dry the skin); wash instead with emollients to
keep the skin moist.
Apply steroid creams to affected areas 1-2 times daily. Use the
least potent steroid that works, for short periods of time only.
Avoid strong steroids in children. A weak steroid (e.g.
hydrocortisone 1%) can be used for short periods on the face or in
flexures.
Severe chronic allergy can be relieved by prednisolone and other

steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. azathioprine).
Treat 2° bacterial infection vigorously.
Breastfeeding may reduce the risk of atopic eczema. This is worth
emphasizing for infants with a family history of eczema.

Management of psoriasis
This is a chronic condition, partly responsive to agents that depress
cell turnover and partly responsive to immunosuppressive therapy.
Treatment options are:
Mild cases require reassurance alone.
Emollients help to restore and maintain barrier function.
Coal tar derivatives and dithranol ointments and creams are
cheap but cosmetically unpleasant. Apply to lesions, starting at a
low concentration and gradually increase the concentration.
Systemic therapy may be required occasionally for generalized
illness, particularly in the elderly. Options include methotrexate
or ciclosporin. In general, systemic corticosteroids should be
avoided.

Fig. 14.3 Common patterns of dermatitis/eczema.

Vasculitis
Cutaneous vasculitis may occur in isolation, but often represents
similar damage to blood vessels in other organs. Vessel wall damage
presents as a range of morphologically distinct skin manifestations,
including urticaria, palpable purpura, ulcers, necrosis, livedo
reticularis. Superficial lesions may be vesicular/blistering; deep lesions
may be nodular (e.g. erythema nodosum) and occasional suppurating.
Urticaria occurs more commonly in infants, necrosis more commonly in
adults. (Note: bruising and nonpalpable purpura are more
characteristic of platelet deficiency.)
Vascular damage may be mediated by several mechanisms. Commonly,
immune complex deposition triggers complement activation and
neutrophil infiltration and disintegration, causing a leucocytoclastic
vasculitis. Lymphocytic vasculitis is also a common cause, and occurs
due to cell-mediated immune responses to e.g. drugs and infections
(viruses, bacteria, rickettsia). Antigen excess most commonly occurs in
the context of overwhelming acute disease (e.g. streptococcal or
meningococcal infection, autoimmune diseases such as SLE,
malignancy) or drugs (including herbal remedies). Circulating noxious
agents usually localize to the venular bed; arteriolar damage causes
infarcts and embolic phenomena. Arthritis is a common, nonthreatening association, classically described in Henoch-Schönlein
purpura in children (see box).
Prognosis depends on vital organ involvement. Monitor regularly for
haematuria as a sign of renal involvement.

Management
Antibody ‘excess’ occurs as a physiological mechanism for removal
of antigen, and vasculitis frequently resolves spontaneously,
particularly in children.
NSAIDs may help (caution in renal impairment).
Treatment of infection or severe tissue breakdown eliminates
triggers.

Persistent leg vasculitis benefits from elevation of the limb.
Consider corticosteroids if multi-organ involvement and fever
(caution in severe infections). Mild renal involvement does not
require specific therapy. Azathioprine or cyclosphosphamide may
have a role in severe disease e.g. URT involvement with necrosis.

Erythema nodosum
This presents as symmetrical, tender, erythematous nodules on the
shins or forearms, representing a nodular panniculitis associated with a
lymphocytic vasculitis. Some causes are shown in the box opposite.
Investigation is directed at underlying causes. It is usual to exclude TB,
sarcoid, streptococcoal sore throat, and inflammatory bowel disease,
but most infections can be an infrequent cause. Treatment is
symptomatic (analgesia). Most lesions resolve spontaneously over
several days.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura
Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the name given to a syndrome of
vasculitis (usually manifest as palpable purpura affecting the legs
and buttocks), arthralgia, peri-articular oedema, abdominal pain,
and glomerulonephritis, most commonly seen in children. It is an
immune complex phenomenon, thought to be due to an
environmental precipitant (e.g. streptococcal sore throat) in
genetically susceptible individuals. Complications include GI
bleeding (due to involvement of the GI mucosa), intussusception,
nephritic syndrome; rarely, it may cause a protein-losing
enteropathy, orchitis, or CNS involvement. The condition is usually
self-limiting. Severe renal involvement may require
immunosuppressive therapy.

Connective tissue diseases (e.g. SLE)
Malignancy
Radiotherapy

Urticaria
Urticaria is characterized by transient wheals (swelling and flushing of

the skin) which are often itchy. Individual lesions last 30 minutes to 24
h, although new lesions may continue to develop. The reaction may be
accompanied by joint pains, stomach aches, and fever. It occurs when
allergens (e.g. food, drugs, helmiths) bind IgE to stimulate the release
of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine in the skin, causing
dermal oedema. Other triggers include immune complex disease and
complement activation (e.g. due to antivenom, penicillins, infections),
and the direct effect of some molecules to cause release of histamine
in the skin (e.g. drugs such as morphine, shellfish). Urticaria may be a
manifestation of vasculitis (e.g. in meningococcal septicaemia), when
lesions may be delayed in onset, last many hours, and become
purpuric.
In angioedema, the oedema extends into the subcutaneous tissues.
Larger, more solitary lesions lasting 4-48 h may occur, and there may
dramatic swelling of the eyes, lips, and oropharynx.
Chronic urticaria: recurrent urticaria over >3 months. Causes include
helminth infection, food additives. Often no single aetiology
identified.
Papular urticaria: itchy and persistent papules following damage to
epidermis, often by insect bite. Lesions intensely pruritic and often
blister.
Dermographism is a common exaggerated response in which a linear
wheal surrounded by a flare occurs immediately following a scratch.
Urticaria may be life-threatening when:
It is part of an anaphylactic reaction.
Angioedema compromises the airway.
It is part of a severe systemic disease (e.g. septicaemia, SLE).

Management
Identify and remove/treat the stimulus (check for intestinal helminths,
trichinosis, onchocerciasis, dracunculosis, lymphatic filiariasis,
strongyloidiasis). Give antihistamine (e.g. Chlorphenamine 4 mg PO 4

hrly; promethazine 10-20 mg tds or 25 mg bd is more sedative).
Steroids may help reduce airway inflammation in angioedema. Treat
anaphylaxis as on
p 351.

Erythema multiforme
As the name suggests, lesions of erythema multiforme take a variety of
forms, including characteristic ‘target lesions’ — round, erythematous
areas with a pale or dusky and sometimes vesicular centre. The rash is
symmetrical and typically involves extensor surfaces and the palms
and soles. Recognized triggers are summarized in the box on
p 555.
It is usually self-limiting.

Disorders of pigmentation

P.558

Skin pigmentation is mainly due to melanin ± other endogenous
pigments (e.g. bilirubin). Some common causes of hyper- and
hypopigmentation are given in the boxes opposite.

Hypopigmentation
Melanin is produced by melanocytes and transferred to keratinocytes
in melanosomes. Loss of keratinocytes (exfoliation) therefore causes
hypopigmentation, so skin is often paler following inflammation. When
due to a mildly dry skin, chapping, or eczema, it is termed pityriasis
(meaning branny) alba. This typically occurs on the face and limbs in
children.

Pityriasis versicolor
is due to Pityrosporum yeasts, themselves slightly brownish, which
cause slightly scaly patches of hypopigmentation, especially of the
upper trunk. The effect is most marked following sun exposure. In
light-skinned individuals, the patches may look hyperpigmented.
Treatment: regular application of selenium sulphide shampoo for 2-3
weeks; or itraconazole 200 mg daily for a week.
Depigmentation due to tuberculoid leprosy is more chronic, and scale,
if present, is more adherent and does not usually exfoliate easily.

Hypopigmented patches due to leprosy will be anaesthetic to pinprick.

Vitiligo
Vitiligo is the most important cause of hypopigmentation. Melanocyte
death causes patches of complete depigmentation, often in a
symmetrical distribution, which may occasionally become generalized.
It affects ~2% of the world's population, and can be very disfiguring in
those with pigmented skin, triggering unjustified fears of contagion
and genetic transmission. There is often a personal or family history of
associated autoimmune disease (e.g. thyroid, pernicious anaemia,
diabetes). There is some evidence that free radicals mediate
melanocyte injury, and lesions may be triggered by minor injuries such
as knocks and abrasions.
Treatment is so unsatisfactory that patients should be protected from
spending all their income on a search for cures. Early lesions may
respond to strong topical steroids but the risk of skin atrophy
discourages long-term use. Sun exposure may help, although areas of
vitiligo will not tan. PUVA (phototherapy in combination with topical or
systemic psoralens that sensitize the skin to ultraviolet radiation) may
be more effective. Camouflage with sweat- and seawater-proof creams
is tedious to apply but safe and effective. It is a self-help remedy that
assuages frequent anger that ‘nothing can be done’. For small,
disfiguring facial lesions, cosmetic surgical transplantation of
epidermis carrying healthy melanocytes is recommended for patients
able to afford it.

Albinism
Albinism is caused by genetic defects in the enzyme tyrosinase, which
is required for melanin synthesis. Tyrosinase may be either defective
(less severe clinical features) or completely absent. Lack of melanin
leads to white skin and hair, with red eyes due to a lack of iris
pigmentation. Those affected develop potentially fatal squamous cell
skin cancers in
early adult life. Absence of retinal pigment impairs vision and
schooling. In some communities significant stigma is attached to the

condition. In certain areas (e.g. Tanzania), special programmes exist
to educate communities to manage those affected.

Causes of hyperpigmentation
Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Addison's disease.
Liver disease.
Haemochromatosis.
Acanthosis nigricans.
Chloasma (melasma).
Renal failure.
Drugs (e.g. amiodarone, clofazimine).
Naevi.
Melanoma.
Congenital (e.g. neurofibromatosis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome).

Causes of hypopigmentation
Congenital
Albinism.
Phenylketonuria.
Tuberous sclerosis.
Acquired
Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (including onchocerciasis).
Pityriasis alba.
Pityriasis versicolor.
Vitiligo.
Tuberculoid leprosy.
Lichen sclerosis et atrophicus.
Drugs (e.g. skin-lightening creams).

Skin cancers
The most important risk factor for cutaneous malignancy is sun
damage, either long-term exposure to strong sunlight (most skin
cancers) or sun burn (melanoma). Melanin pigment protects against
sun damage, so lack or loss of melanin in albinism, white-skinned
individuals, or depipigmenting conditions increases cancer risk. Paleskinned people should be encouraged to seek shade, use sunscreens on
sun-exposed parts of their body, and to wear a hat outdoors. Infants
should be protected from sunburn.

Actinic (solar) keratoses
These are pre-malignant, hyperkeratotic, adherent scaly lesions on an
erythematous base, which occur post middle age in pale-skinned
persons with long-term exposure to the sun. May resolve spontaneously
or develop into SCC or BCC. Treat before become malignant. Many
respond to emollients. Persistent lesions should be destroyed by
curettage, cryotherapy, or daily application of topical fluorouracil
cream.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
SCCs occur in sun-exposed areas. They may develop from actinic
keratoses or at the edges of chronic ulcers and areas of inflammation
(marjolin's ulcer). Oral lesions occur in long-term smokers. Usually a
fleshy dry nodule breaks down to form an ulcerating lesion with hard
raised edges. They are locally very invasive. Systemic metastasis
rarely occurs. Management: early, wide, local excision is essential;
local infiltration is often more extensive than is apparent. Removal at
visibly obvious margins is often associated with recurrence.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
BCCs occur in sun-exposed areas on the face. A slow-growing papule
usually breaks centrally to form an ulcer with a rolled ‘pearl-coloured’
edge. Local infiltration may gradually cause extensive tissue damage
and disfigurement, but they do not metastasize. Management:

curettage, cauterization, or cryotherapy. (Note: the tumour's tendency
to spread intradermally beyond the margins visible at the surface.)
Fluorouracil cream may be used after surgery. Radiotherapy is also
effective.

Melanoma
Any pigmented lesion that is variably coloured, changes shape,
thickness, or colour, starts to bleed, or ulcerates, should be considered
a potential melanoma. Pigmented satellite lesions around a mole also
suggest a melanoma. They frequently originate in moles and are more
common in people with many moles, who should be encouraged to
examine these regularly and report changes to a doctor. Prognosis
depends on the depth and degree of invasion. Melanoma is extremely
invasive and may only be recognized following metastasis to the CNS
or other sites. The original lesion may be quite innocuous.
Management: is immediate, wide local excision.

Common cutaneous viral infections

P.562

Herpes simplex
Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) cause various clinical
syndromes including mucocutaneous disease, keratitis, encephalitis,
and aseptic meningitis. Transmission is by direct contact through
mucosal surfaces (oral or genital) or skin abrasions. 1° mucocutaneous
disease, incl. gingivostomatitis, pharyngitis, herpes labialis (cold
sores), and genital herpes, may be due to either viral subtype, but
recurrent oral and genital herpes are more commonly due to HSV-1 and
HSV-2 respectively.
Typical lesions are initially red and itchy but begin to vesiculate within
24 h. Fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy are particularly associated
with primary infection. A severe form with widespread vesiculation
particularly affecting the face (eczema herpeticum) may occur in
patients with atopic eczema. HSV may also cause erythema
multiforme.

Management:
treat herpes labialis with topical aciclovir and more severe infections
with oral (200-400 mg 5 times a day) or iv (5-10 mg/kg tds) aciclovir for
5-10 days. Frequent severe recurrences warrant aciclovir prophylaxis
(400 mg bd PO for 6-12 months).

Verruca vulgaris (common warts)
Flat, filiform, or verrucous warts caused by human papilloma virus
(HPV); often regress spontaneously. They may be troublesome in
HIV/AIDS.

Treatment:
wart paints (e.g. topical salicylic acid), curettage, cryotherapy.

Poxvirus infections
Molluscum contagiosum
Molluscum contagiosum, caused by a poxvirus, produces 0.2-0.4 cm
smooth ‘warts’ with central umbilication. It is common in children, in
whom spontaneous resolution is the rule. Widespread lesions may
occur in HIV/AIDS.

Treatment:
includes local application of e.g. phenol or trichloracetic acid spiked
into the centre of the lesion; cryotherapy.

Smallpox
Smallpox was eradicated in 1976, but is a potential agent of bioterrorism. Control relies on isolation of cases and vaccination of
contacts; there is no effective treatment. It carries ~50% mortality.

Monkeypox and tanapox

These poxviruses, closely related to smallpox, still cause occasional
infections. The rash (1 or 2 lesions in tanapox; many covering the
whole body in monkeypox) is preceded by a 2-3 day prodromal period
with fever and other systemic signs. Lymphadenopathy occurs in
monkeypox, characteristically involving both femoral and inguinal
nodes. Unlike chickenpox, the lesions are always at the same stage and
the peripheries are involved early. Both infections tend to resolve
without treatment. Human-human transmission has been reported
within households with monkeypox.

Varicella zoster virus

P.564

This herpes virus causes chickenpox (varicella) following 1° infection,
and shingles (herpes zoster) following reactivation of latent virus in
sensory ganglia. Transmission is by respiratory droplet inhalation or
contact with vesicular fluid.
Chickenpox is generally a mild infection of children; it may be severe
in neonates, adults (especially in pregnancy), and the
immunocompromised. There is prodrome of fever, headache, and
malaise followed by an itchy erythematous eruption involving the
scalp and face and moving distally to involve the trunk. Daily ‘crops’ of
lesions progress from papules to vesicles, pustules, and scabs and all
stages may be present at once (cf. poxviruses). Complications: 2°
bacterial infection is common in children and may cause scarring;
pneumonitis (mainly seen in adults, especially smokers); mild
encephalitis (ataxia); thrombocytopenia.
Herpes zoster usually occurs only once, often in the elderly or
immunosuppressed, affecting just one sensory ganglion and associated
dermatome. Scanty distant vesicles may occur due to haematogenous
spread, and rarely disseminated zoster may occur in the
immunocompromised. Paraesthesia and shooting pains can occur in the
affected dermatome for several days before the appearance of a
vesicular, erythematous rash and mild fever. The vesicles scab after 37 days. Zoster (or zoster scars) in patients <40 years old or in >1
dermatome suggests impaired cell mediated immunity, most commonly
due to HIV. Complications include:

Postherpetic neuralgia: may be very painful and difficult to treat.
Opiates and/or amitriptyline (10-25 mg nocte) may help.
Herpes zoster ophthalmica (of the 1st division of the Vth cranial
nerve) may be complicated by conjunctivitis, keratitis, and
periorbital swelling.
HIV-associated herpes zoster can be more severe and prolonged, and
affect >1 dermatome. Chickenpox is not a feature of HIV.

Management
Antiviral therapy is indicated for herpes zoster and for chickenpox in
adolescents, adults, the immunocompromised, and patients with
complications; it may be considered for chickenpox in high-risk
patients e.g. those with chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, or skin
conditions. Treatment should be initiated early, within 72 h of onset of
the rash and continued for 7-10 days. Give acyclovir 800 mg PO 5 times
daily or 5 mg/kg IV tds in severe infections (10 mg/kg in the
immunocompromised). Alternatives for herpes zoster are valaciclovir
(1 g PO tds) or famciclovir (500 mg PO tds). Steroids may speed
resolution of herpes zoster and reduce incidence of post herpetic
neuralgia (controversial).
Chickenpox in children: treat symptoms (paracetamol, topical
antipruritics). Cutting fingernails and attention to hygiene ↓ risk of
2° bacterial infection. In neonates/high-risk groups: acyclovir may ↓
duration and complications (Oral: 200 mg qds if age <2 y; 20 mg/kg
(max 800 mg) qds if ≥2 y. IV: 10-20 mg/kg if age <3 m; 250 mg/m2 if 3
m-12 y.)

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)

P.566

A widespread disease, caused by different species of Leishmania
parasites, that manifests in slightly different ways. L. tropica is
anthroponotic; the L. mexicana and L. braziliensis species complexes
(New World) and L. major (Old World) are zoonoses of rodents, dogs, or
other mammals. Transmission occurs following the bite of Phlebotomus

and Lutzomyia sandfly vectors, following which the parasite multiplies
in skin macrophages, causing local tissue damage.

Clinical features
Weeks to months after a bite, a nodule develops at the bite site. This
grows slowly (up to 5 cm), becomes ulcerated, and is covered by a
crust which may drop off to expose a relatively painless ulcer — pain
often indicates 2° bacterial infection. The ulcer may be dry or
exudative, depending on the species. It heals over months or years,
leaving a ‘tissue paper’ scar. Satellite lesions may occur. 2° infection is
uncommon. L. mexicana classically causes lesions of the pinna
(‘chiclero ulcer’) that take years to heal, often destroying the pinna.
Certain forms do not resolve spontaneously, but are uncommon
compared to the vast numbers of classical CL:
Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) only occurs in New World CL. L.
braziliensis is the most important cause (also occurs with L.
guyanensis, L. panamensis). 2° mucocutaneous lesions develop
months to years after 1° lesion has healed. Starting on the upper lip
or nostril edge, MCL eventually destroys the mucosa and cartilage of
the nasopharynx, larynx, or lips.
Disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL) is usually caused by L.
mexicana or L. aethiopica: The 1° nodule spreads slowly without
ulceration while 2° lesions appear symmetrically on limbs and face.
In individuals unable to mount an appropriate immune response,
infection continues to spread and responds only transiently to
chemotherapy (anergic DCL).
Recidivans leishmaniasis is usually caused by L. tropica, often on the
cheek. The lesion heals in the centre but nodules with scanty
parasites persist at the edges for years.

Diagnosis
Clinical, supported by identification of Giemsa-stained parasites in skin
smears taken from the edge of active ulcers.

Fig. 14.4 Cutaneous leishmaniasis of the hand due to L. tropica
(left) and Leishmania recidivans of the face and arm (right).

Local treatments for CL
Suitable for Old World CL (L. tropica and L. major) and L. mexicana
as there is no risk of these causing later MCL.
Intra-lesional infiltration of sodium stibogluconate or meglumine
antimoniate is widely used: 1 ml of undiluted antimonial is
injected into the base and edges of the lesion This is repeated 2-3
times weekly for 2-3 week. If the injections are very painful,
lignocaine 2% can be mixed in the syringe.
Leishmania are killed at 40-42°C, so heating the wound by
radiofrequency or heat pads improves healing.
Cryotherapy is successfully used in Old World CL, either alone or
combined with intra-lesional antimonial.
Topical treatment with paromomycin 15% ointment is effective in
L. major and L. mexicana.

Systemic therapy for Old World CL
L. tropica and L. major cause Old World CL, do not cause MCL, and
usually self-heal without problems. Only need systemic treatment if:
Sores too large or badly sited for local therapy.

Ulcerated or severely inflamed sores, or overlying a joint.
Disease with lymphatic spread.
Lesions with involvement of cartilage.

Treatments
Oral fluconazole 200 mg od for 6 weeks is effective in L. major CL.
Miltefosine or injections of antimonials or amphotericin B — see
below.

Systemic therapy for New World CL
CL from Central or South America could be caused by L. braziliensis.
If in doubt, consider all New World CL to be L. braziliensis, because
differentiation from L. mexicana is usually impossible
geographically, clinically, or parasitologically unless PCR available.
Systemic treatment of L. braziliensis CL should prevent subsequent
MCL.

Treatments
10-20 mg/kg/day sodium stibogluconate by IM or slow IV route, or
meglumine antimoniate by deep IM for a minimum of 4 weeks, or
until lesion healed.
Pentamidine isethionate 4 mg/kg once or twice weekly until lesion
is no longer visible.
Miltefosine 100 mg/day x 28 days has been successful in many
cases.
MCL responds better to amphotericin B: give initial 1 mg test
dose, then 5-10 mg, increasing by 5-10 mg daily up to maximum of
0.5-1 mg/kg administered on alternating days (total cumulative
dose of 1-3 g usually required).

Treatment of diffuse CL
DCL is almost impossible to cure: give sodium stibogluconate or
meglumine antimoniate 20 mg/kg IM od for several months after
clinical improvement; relapse is common.

Lymphoedema (elephantiasis)
Lymphoedema is caused by obstruction to lymph flow causing regional
accumulation of lymph in the soft tissues. There is increased
susceptibility to soft tissue infection which causes further lymphatic
damage and a vicious cycle of worsening lymphoedema. In some
conditions (particularly lymphatic filariasis), chronic trophic skin
changes including hyperkeratosis, nodular fibrosis, and excess adiposity
may lead to the characteristic appearance of elephantiasis of the
affected limb or body part. Causes of lymphoedema include:
Lymphatic filariasis (see below).
Malignancy (including lymphatic involvement, radiotherapy,
surgery).
Chronic oedema (e.g. congestive cardiac failure).
Lymphatic blockage due to TB, leprosy, or KS.
Podoconiosis.
Congenital (Milroy's disease).

Management
Involves treating the underlying cause and general measures to
promote lymph flow and prevent disease progression and
complications (see box).

Lymphatic filariasis
Lymphatic filariasis is caused by 3 geographically distinct species of
filarial worm, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and B. timori
(Fig.14.6,
p 571). Transmission occurs via the bite of mosquito
vectors. Infective larvae enter the host during a blood meal and
migrate to lymphatics, particularly around the groins and axillae,
where they develop into adult worms which may survive >10 years.
Females grow up to 10 cm in length (males ~4 cm) and produce
microfilaria (~260 µm) which enter the blood stream. Onward
transmission occurs when microfilaria are taken up by a mosquito

during a blood meal. Host pathology is thought to be due to the
immune response to adult worms and endosymbiotic Wolbachia (see
box). Microfilariae are responsible for tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.
In endemic areas, asymptomatic microfilaraemia is common, as are
asymptomatic seropositive patients without microfilaraemia.

Acute lymphatic filariasis
(‘filarial fever’) is usually recurrent, most commonly affects the limbs,
spermatic cord/testes (funiculitis/epididymo-orchitis ± hydrocoele),
and breasts, and encompasses 2 syndromes:
Acute filarial lymphangitis (AFL) caused by death of adult worms
leads to a local inflammatory nodule / lymphangitis which spreads
distally, accompanied by systemic symptoms including fever, rigors,
headache, myalgia, arthralgia ±delirium.
Acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA) due to 2° bacterial
infection causes ascending lymphangitis with associated soft tissue
infection/inflammation (cellulitis) and systemic upset. Lymphatic
damage from recurrent attacks probably causes chronic lymphatic
filariasis.

General measures in the management of lymphoedema
The basis of management is the promotion of lymph flow by
reducing the gravitational venous load on the impaired lymphatics
and preventing the cycle of inflammation and further lymphatic
damage. The following simple measures may profoundly improve
the outcome of lymphoedema by slowing down or halting disease
progression. They also benefit patients with established severe
lymphoedema/elephantiasis, as collateral lymphatic channels reestablish lymph flow if kept free from 2° infection, and
prevention/treatment of infection reduces social stigma associated
with foul smelling, chronically infected tissues.

Minimize risk of further lymphatic damage due to
inflammation:
Wash the affected part twice daily with soap and water.

Use emollients to promote skin barrier function.
Wear shoes; keep nails clean.
Treat minor wounds or abrasions with topical antiseptics.
Ensure early antibiotic treatment of soft tissue infections.

Promote lymph flow in the affected limb:
Exercise.
Raise the affected limb at night.
Diuretics to reduce the venous load.
Deep expiratory breathing e.g. chanting (increases venous return).
Massage of the affected limb.

Fig. 14.5 Global distribution of lymphatic filariasis which affects
120 million people in 83 countries. (Reproduced from the Weekly
Epidemiological Report, No.22, 2006, with permission from the
WHO.)

Chronic lymphatic filiariasis:
usually occurs as a result of lymphatic damage from recurrent acute
attacks, which continue to complicate and exacerbate the chronic
phase of the disease. Clinical features include:

Hydrocoele, which may be massive and interfere with walking.
Usually contains clear, straw-coloured liquid ± blood/lymph; may
contain microfilariae. Repeated tapping of fluid causes fibrosis ±
abscesses.
Lymphoedema (elephantiasis) of the legs is common, usually
asymmetrical, and starts distally.
Chyluria and lymphuria are due to rupture into the renal pelvis or
bladder of damaged lymphatics draining (i) intestines → fat in urine
(chyluria) or (ii) other organs → lymph in urine. Associated
haematuria may cause clot retention. Chronic chyluria may cause
malabsorption.

Other complications:
attributed to lymphatic filariasis, often in the absence of
microfilaraemia, include arthritis (esp knee); endomyocardial fibrosis;
skin rashes; thrombophlebitis; and nerve palsies.

Microfilarial periodicity:
parasitaemia is periodic, peaking at the key biting time of the
mosquito vector in a particular location. W. bancrofti and B. malayi
usually exhibit nocturnal periodicity (peak parasitaemia around
midnight); in the Pacific, W. bancrofti exhibits diurnal periodicity (peak
about midday). Nocturnal and diurnal subperiodic forms also occur
with less marked peaks of parasitaemia at night and day respectively.

Diagnosis:
in endemic areas is largely clinical. Parasitological diagnosis relies on
isolation of microfilaria from blood, so samples should be taken during
peak parasitaemia. The poor sensitivity of stained blood films may be
improved by membrane filtration techniques. Simple card tests to
detect circulating filarial antigens (CFA) are available for W. bancrofti
but not Brugia species. Serology has a role, particularly in travellers
returning from endemic areas.

Management
Albendazole 400 mg PO bd for 3 weeks kills adult worms but is more
effective in combination with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or
Ivermectin.
Albendazole 400 mg plus either Ivermectin 200 µg/kg or DEC 6
mg/kg, as a single oral dose repeated annually for 5 years, is now
used for mass drug administration programmes.
Avoid DEC in O. volvulus and Loa Loa endemic areas due to risk of
Mazzotti reaction.
Avoid DEC during acute attacks as macrofilaricidal activity ± release
of Wolbachia endotoxins may exacerbate symptoms.
Ivermectin monotherapy only kills microfilaria so needs to be
repeated during the lifetime of the adult worms (may be up to >10
years).
Doxycycline 100 mg PO bd for 6 weeks (against Wolbachia) has been
shown to reduce filaraemia and improve lymphoedema.
Surgical management is required for chronic severe hydrocele. The
long-term benefit of surgery for elephantiasis is often limited.
For general principles of lymphoedema management, see box,
569.

p

Wolbachia endosymbionts in human filarial infections
Endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria (related to Rickettsia) live within
filarial worms and are now recognized to be important in worm
reproduction, development, and pathology. Release from adult
worms of Wolbachia endotoxins is thought to play a major role in
the inflammatory pathology of lymphatic filariasis and
onchocerciasis. Early trials of anti-Wolbachia chemotherapy with
doxycycline have shown significant benefits in both these diseases.

Prevention and public health strategies

Prevention: education to reduce vector-human contact; personal
protection from mosquito bites; vector control.
Mass drug administration: is promoted by GAELF (Global Alliance
to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis) for communities with >5%
infection prevalence. The whole community is treated once
yearly for 5 years with single-dose Albendazole 400 mg plus either
DEC 6 mg/kg or Ivermectin 200µg/kg (avoid DEC in Loa loa or O.
volvulus endemic areas). Addition of DEC to table salt has been
used with success.

Fig. 14.6 Blood film appearances of the microfilariae lymphatic
filariasis.

Onchocerciasis (‘river blindness’)

Onchocerca volvulus occurs in areas with fast-flowing rivers and biting
Similium blackflies, the parasite's vector. In the west African savannah,
it was a common cause of blindness until the Onchocerciasis Control
Programme reduced its prevalence. It still causes blindness and skin
manifestations in other areas. Clinical features include:
Subcutaneous nodules containing adult worms, conspicuous over
bony prominences (e.g. iliac crests, ribs, knees, trochanters).
Cutaneous and eye manifestations due to host inflammatory
reactions to dying microfilariae which migrate in the skin (see box)
and eye. Ocular lesions include transient punctate keratitis and
potentially blinding conditions e.g. sclerosing keratitis, iridocyclitis,
and optic atrophy.

Forms of dermal onchocerciasis
Acute papular onchodermatitis: small scattered itchy papules, ±
vesicles and pustules, ± skin oedema, often on the trunk and
upper limbs.
Chronic papular onchodermatitis: larger itchy, hyperpigmented,
often flat-topped papules ± areas of hyperpigmentation.
Lichenified onchodermatitis: itchy, hyperpigmented papulonodules or plaques which become confluent. The itching is intense
initially; the rash is asymmetrical, often affecting one or both
legs.
Atrophy: loss of elasticity with excessive wrinkles particularly on
the buttocks; inelastic folds of inguinal skin form hanging groins,
often filled with enlarged lymph nodes.
Depigmentation (leopard skin): patches of decreased pigment or
loss contrasted with normally pigmented skin around hair follicles.

Diagnosis:
confirmed by finding microfliariae in skin snips or the eye. Ask the
patient to put their head between their knees for >2 mins before
examining the anterior chamber with a slit-lamp. If skin snip and eye

examinations are both negative but onchocerciasis is still strongly
suspected, perform the Mazzotti test: give DEC 50 mg PO; increased
pruritis within 24-48 h indicates that the patient is infected.

Management
Ivermectin 150 mcg/kg PO stat clears microfilariae from skin for ~6-9
months. Repeat the dose when patient is symptomatic (typically
each 6-12 months) throughout the lifespan of the adult worms (15-20
yrs).
Doxycycline 100 mg PO bd for 4-6 weeks (against Wolbachia
endosymbionts) can reduce microfilariae in skin for 12-18 months.

Prevention:
Ivermectin mass distribution programmes; vector control.

Mazzotti reaction:
DEC may → severe adverse reactions in O. voluvulus infection due
to an immune reaction to worm death. Local reactions include skin
rashes, exacerbation of eye lesions; severe systemic reactions may
occur with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, respiratory distress, and
shock. Avoid DEC therapy in onchocerciasis endemic areas.

Loiasis (Loa loa)

P.574

Loa loa is transmitted in the central African rainforests by bites of
Chrysops horse flies. As the injected filarial larvae mature, they
migrate away from the site in the subcutaneous layers (producing
itching, prickly sensations) or deeper fascial layers (pain,
paraesthesia). Transient ‘calabar swellings’ of the limbs occur at
intervals, lasting between a few hours and days, due to the host
immune response to migrating adult worms; the overlying skin is
slightly inflamed. Worms migrating beneath the conjunctiva may be
clearly visible for minutes to hours, and produce acute eye irritation.

Diagnosis
Clinical or serological; microfilariae can also be found in filtered blood
samples collected around mid-day.

Management
Oral DEC 1 mg/kg on day 1; 1 mg/kg bd on day 2; 2 mg/kg bd on day 3,
and 2-3 mg/kg tds from day 4-21. Start persons with heavy
microfilaraemia at a low dose and give steroid cover for first 2-3 days
(risk of meningoencephalitis with dying microfiaria). Check for mixed
infection with O. volvulus before using DEC — if present, use
ivermectin as there is risk of Mazzotti reaction. Doxycycline 100 mg bd
PO for 4-6 wks will produce a more gradual reduction of
microfilaraemia by acting on endosymbiotic Wolbachia within the
worms.

Prevention
Avoid vector contact; DEC 300 mg PO once weekly may provide
effective prophylaxis; vector control.

Fig. 14.7 Loa loa: calabar swelling (left): this patient noted an
uncomfortable swelling in his right forearm which moved up his
arm over 3-4 days and then disappeared. A subconjunctival adult
worm (right) of Loa loa is seen: this patient felt irritation in his

eye and, when looking in the mirror, noted a moblie thread-like
worm crossing the eye under his conjunctiva; it disappeared in
about 1 hour.

Fig. 14.8 Appearance of Loa loa microfilaria on a blood film.

Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm)
Dracunculus medinensis infection occurs following ingestion of unclean
water containing its copepod crustacean vector. Released larvae
migrate into body cavities where they mature and mate. Months later,
adult females (50-100 cm long) migrate in the subcutaneous layers of
the skin to the extremities where an ulcer forms and the tip of the
worm protrudes. In contact with water, large numbers of larvae are
released from a loop of the worm's uterus which prolapses to the skin
surface.

Clinical features:
include a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to infection. Protrusion of
the gravid female causes a painful blister which may become 2°
infected with bacteria. Some worms migrate to sites such as brain,
joints, or eyes, resulting in cerebral/subdural abscesses, arthritis, or

blindness. Diagnosis is clinical in endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa.

Management:
female worms can be removed before they form a blister by
identifying them subcutaneously and making a small incision in the skin
at their midpoint and pulling the worm out with careful traction and
massage along its track. Metronidazole for 1 week reduces
inflammation and eases the removal. After a blister has burst,
analgesics will be needed before the worm can be pulled out. Keep the
blister clean and covered.

Prevention:
involves improving the water supply or filtering drinking water through
cloth to remove the crustaceans. The Guinea worm eradication
programme has reduced transmission to scattered foci within affected
countries.

Other parasites that invade the skin
Cutaneous (furunculoid) myiasis
This is an infestation of the skin with fly larvae (maggots). Dermatobia
hominis (the tropical botfly) is endemic in Central and South America.
Female flies attach their eggs to mosquitoes and other blood-sucking
arthropods, which deposit the eggs during a blood meal. Warmth from
the host causes the eggs to hatch and larvae penetrate the host skin.
In sub-Saharan Africa, female Cordylobia anthropophaga (tumbu) flies
lay their eggs in shaded soil or clothing hung out to dry (particularly if
contaminated by urine); larvae hatch in 2 days and penetrate the skin.
In both cases, as each larva grows subcutaneously, a ‘boil’-like lesion
with a central punctum develops.

Management:
removal of the larvae. Occluding punctum with Vaseline or fat may
allow larva to be grasped as it emerges for O2. Surgical removal is

sometimes required. Treat any 2° bacterial infection.

Prevention:
insect repellents, clothing and mosquito nets for D. hominis; ironing
clothing (incl. underwear) destroys the eggs of C. anthropophaga.

Tungiasis (Tunga penetrans, the Jigger Flea)
The 1 mm female pig flea burrows into the skin, usually of the toe
webspaces, and grows to about 1 cm in 2 weeks. The female discharges
its eggs on the surface and its collapsed carcass is extruded.

Management:
careful removal of the flea and its eggs. Avoid 2° bacterial infection.

Fig. 14.9 (a) Furunculoid myiasis: this traveller developed a ‘boil’
on her buttock soon after return from Africa from which the larva
of Cordylobia anthropophaga (the ‘tumbu fly’) was extracted. (b)
Tunga penetrans (the ‘Jigger flea’): two lesions are seen at the

edge of the toenail.

Cutaneous larva migrans
Infection with filariform larvae of canine hookworms (Ancylostoma
caninum or A. braziliense) for whom humans are accidental hosts.
Larvae migrate 1-2 cm per day in the skin, leaving an intensely itchy,
red irregular track, before they eventually die.

Management:
single-dose albendazole 400 mg by mouth. Thiabendazole cream or 1015% suspension can also be applied topically. Untreated, the rash will
eventually resolve spontaneously.

Larva currens
A cutaneous eruption resulting from autoinfection into the skin (often
of the buttocks/perianal area) by Strongyloides stercoralis. The
urticarial wheals are linear and move ~1-2 cm per hour; the abdomen
and buttocks are most affected.

Podoconiosis
Podoconiosis is a cause of lymphoedema in certain highland areas of
east and central Africa rich in volcanic soils. Microscopic mineral
particles penetrate the dermis of the sole of the foot and cause
chronic lymphatic damage, especially in young adults who habitually
walk barefoot.

The non-venereal treponematoses
These disfiguring conditions primarily affect children in communities
with poor hygiene. Like syphilis, they have three stages, with a long
period of latency before the manifestation of 3° disease. Unlike
syphilis, the 3° lesions are infective, which causes problems for their
eradication since it is difficult to identify latent carriers. Transmission

is by direct contact, probably through abrasions (spirochetes cannot
penetrate intact skin).

Clinical features
Yaws: the 1° lesion is a papule which develops into a round/oval 2-5
cm painless, itchy papilloma. It normally heals in 3-6 months. Weeks
to years after this lesion resolves, multiple 2° lesions occur in crops
on any part of the body and last up to 6 months. They are papules or
papillomas of various shapes; they may ulcerate and form yellowbrown scabs. Other lesions include dermatitis or hyperkeratosis of
palms and soles; local lymphadenopathy; dactylitis; long bone
swelling; rarely, osteitis of nasal bones. After a latent period, the
disease reappears with necrotic destruction of skin and bones
(gummas). Other clinical features include hyperkeratosis; palatal
destruction and 2° infection; sabre tibia; bursitis.
Endemic syphilis (bejel): 1° lesion is rarely seen. The first lesions are
usually painless ulcers of lips and oropharynx. There is
osteoperiostitis of long bones, condylomata lata, angular stomatitis;
rarely a 2° syphilislike rash; and generalized lymphadenopathy. Late
lesions include bone destruction (as in yaws), skin ulcers, and palmar
and plantar keratosis.
Pinta primarily affects the skin. Satellite lesions surround the 1°
papule; there is regional painless lymphadenopathy. 2° stage plaques
appear within a few months anywhere on the body. The 3° disease
involves depigmentation and atrophy of the skin.

erythromicin 250-500 mg PO qds or amoxicillin 500 mg tds for 15 days).

Prevention:
identification of active cases, followed by treatment of all contacts. If
>10% in a community are actively infected, all should receive
penicillin.

Bone, Joint, and Soft Tissue Infections
Tony Berendt
Section editor

Infections of skin
Skin infections can be divided into:
Pyodermas: pus is formed within the skin; a localized infection.
Spreading infections: diffuse infection spreading along tissue planes.

Pyodermas
1. Impetigo
Superficial infection of the epidermis, often at sites of skin damage
(e.g. cuts, eczema, chickenpox, scabies, insect bites). A golden-yellow
vesicle quickly bursts to become an area of epidermal loss, which
crusts over and enlarges. There may be a little pus under the edges of
the lesion. Impetigo is highly contagious: 1° lesion → satellite lesions
elsewhere on the skin (spread by patient's own fingers) → infection of
contacts. Staph aureus and Strep pyogenes are most commonly found,
often together.

Management
Give systemic antibiotics (see Table 15.1).

Apply topical antiseptics (e.g. Gentian violet or chlorhexidine).
Soak off crusts in saline or weak antiseptic.

2. Furuncles (boils), carbuncles, and abscesses
Staph aureus causes abscesses in the dermis or subcutaneous fat. A
furuncle (boil, pimple) is pus collecting in a hair follicle or a
sebaceous/sweat gland in the skin. Carbuncles are furuncles that have
spread deeper (often 2° to patient squeezing or sitting on the
furuncle), so multiple points of pus occur. An abscess is a collection of
pus at a deeper level — indicated by swelling, erythema, warmth, and
fluctuance. Tenderness is common in all skin infections, but pressure
on an abscess is very painful.

Management
Drain pus and remove necrotic tissue and debris. The abscess cavity
should be packed and left to heal by 2° intention — do not suture or
allow the opening to close until the interior has healed.
If the infection spreads in the surrounding soft tissues, give 1-2 wks
of antibiotics (see Table 15.1). If antibiotics are unavailable or in
short supply, drainage and good wound care alone may suffice.

Spreading infections
These are more commonly caused by beta-haemolytic Streptococci
(BHS) (e.g. Group A BHS, also known as Strep pyogenes) than by Staph
aureus, except when surrounding a staphylococcal abscess.

1. Erysipelas
Spreading infection in the epidermis, producing a large area of red,
shiny, tender skin. The patient is unwell and febrile. The involved area
is sharply demarcated from normal skin because the dermo-epidermal
junction limits the spread of the inflammatory response in a lateral
direction. Erysipelas is common on the face. Severe infection produces
skin blistering; necrotic tissue encourages toxin production so the

infection becomes worse if the infection is not treated.

Management:
antibiotics (see Table 15.1).

Soft tissue infections
Insect bites, reduced access to antibiotics, poverty, and
malnutrition contribute to a high incidence of soft tissue infections
in the tropics. Some conditions, such as pyomyositis (infection of
muscle), are particularly common in the tropics compared to
temperate zones.

Oral route:
Oral flucloxacillin and cefuroxamine have incomplete
bioavailability; not advised for severe infection. Penicillin is
incompletely absorbed, so choose amoxicillin 0.5-1 g PO tds or
ampicillin 0.5-1 g PO qds
Flucloxacillin 500 mg-1 g PO qds
Cefuroxime 250 mg PO bd

Clindamycin 300 mg PO q6 h
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bd
Metronidazole 800 mg PO initially, then 400-500 mg PO tds; or
Ig tds PR

2. Cellulitis
Infection involves the dermis and usually subcutaneous fat as well.
There is obvious diffuse swelling and the erythematous area is not so
clearly demarcated from uninvolved skin as it is in erysipelas. It
commonly involves the lower leg, spreading from breaks in the skin:
minor injuries, fungal infection (e.g. athlete's foot), scabies, or insect
bites which have been scratched. Always bear in mind an underlying
abscess, which may form within cellulitis, especially in the hand. When
cellulitis is near the knee or elbow but spares the extremity, consider
an underlying prepatellar, pretibial, or olecranon bursitis.

Management:
see box
Scaling and desquamation are normal after some days of infection;
blisters may require aspiration but generally protect the lesion and
should be left intact in most cases. Subcutaneous abscesses can
develop despite antibiotics. Recurrence is relatively common: if
multiple recurrences occur, prolonged courses of treatment, long-term
prophylaxis, or standby antibiotics to take at the onset of symptoms
can be helpful.

3. Bursitis
Bursitis most commonly involves the elbow or the knee, and presents
as cellulitis over the joint, or as a red painful swelling. The pathogens
are usually BHS or Staph. aureus. Although bursitis often restricts the
movement of the joint, this is related to the mechanical effects of the
swelling and the associated tenderness of the soft tissues, and careful
examination can usually distinguish bursitis from the much more
serious condition of septic arthritis.

Management:
(see box)
In chronic bursitis, suspect TB, underlying osteomyelitis (erosion of
bone detectable on X-ray), or chronic septic arthritis.

4. Necrotizing fasciitis
Necrotizing fasciitis is a medical and surgical emergency with high
mortality. The most common cause is Group A BHS, but other
organisms (e.g. Vibrio vulnificus acquired from contact with water, or
mixed aerobe/anaerobe infections following abdominal or perineal
wounds) can also cause necrotizing fasciitis.
Infection spreads very rapidly in the loose connective tissue adjacent
to the fascial plane, leading to necrosis of subcutaneous tissues and
thrombosis of blood vessels that supply the skin or muscle. The pace of
spread and severity of the underlying process are greater than the
time it takes devascularized skin to necrose. As a result, necrotizing
fasciitis typically causes severe systemic upset (often with high fever
and shock) and pain that seem disproportionate to the local physical
signs.

Management:
see box
Development of fixed tissue staining, echymoses, superficial blistering

(early in disease, not late as in cellulitis, and on obviously unhealthy
skin) makes the diagnosis probable.

MRSA
Methicillin resistance occurs in clones of Staph aureus that have a
mutation in the penicillin binding protein on their surface.
Methicillin resistance indicates resistance to all beta lactam
antibiotics, including flucloxacillin and co-amoxiclav. Methicillinresistant Staph aureus (MRSA) is becoming more common in
developing countries and, in particular, in large centres. By 2006,
>20% of Staph aureus isolates in large urban hospitals in South
America, India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, and
Cameroon, and in many other countries were MRSA. In rural
settings, the prevalence of MRSA is far lower — but increasing. Thus,
whilst flucloxacillin, co-amoxiclav, and cephalosporins are still
recommended as 1st line treatment for bone, joint, and soft tissue
infections, it should always be borne in mind that poor clinical
response may indicate MRSA. In centres in which MRSA is prevalent,
empiric treatment for Staph aureus infections is with vancomycin or
teicoplanin. In most areas, doxycycline has high activity against
MRSA, and in many areas chloramphenicol and fucidic acid are
effective. Rifampicin, although effective against most MRSA strains,
is generally restricted for use in TB.
It is important to establish whether MRSA is prevalent in the
locations you are working; whether specimens can be sent for
culture and sensitivity; and what antibiotics remain effective
against the local strain of MRSA.

Management of cellulitis
Antibiotics for 1 week or longer.
If cellulitis is 2° to a chronic ulcer, in a diabetic, or follows water
contact, broaden the antibiotic cover to include Gram -ve rods
and anaerobes.
Consider wound debridement and cleaning.
Drain underlying abscesses (esp. in the hand).

Rest and elevate the limb.

Management of bursitis
Antibiotics for 2-3 weeks.
Needle aspiration to remove some pus without surgery — this is
useful for diagnosis and symptom relief.
Avoid incision and drainage where possible: the synovial fluid
produced in the bursa produces high-volume wound drainage, can
delay healing, and sometimes produces a synovial fistula.

Management of necrotizing fasciitis
Early surgery is mandatory: explore the fascial plane and excise
the affected area back to bleeding tissue.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics: high-dose penicillin plus gentamicin
plus metronidazole is a good 1st choice. Where available, add
clindamycin (beneficial in animal models of necrotizing fasciitis).
Adjust antibiotics when cultures are available from surgical
samples.
Intensive care support and reconstructive surgery — without
these, prognosis is poor.

Infections of muscle
Pyomyositis
Also called ‘tropical pyomyositis’, it is a 1° bacterial infection of
striated muscle that is common throughout the tropics and subtropics,
particularly in young men.

Clinical features
There are three characteristic phases:
1. Woody phase: the affected muscle is painful, hard, and woody on
palpation. The patient may have little systemic illness; this phase

may last for days-months. The condition is difficult to diagnose, and
can sometimes be mistaken for a tumour.
2. The muscle liquefies → intramuscular abscess, with a very tender
swollen muscle. Ultrasound shows intramuscular collections; for
psoas abscess, CT or MRI scanning may be necessary. (Note: psoas
abscess is also a complication of lumbar spinal infections and does
not always represent ‘pure’ pyomyositis.) Gram stain and culture of
pus usually reveals Staph. aureus (rarely BHS).
3. A bacteraemic illness ± ?multiple abscesses in different muscles.

Management
Antibiotics for >3 weeks.
Drain abscesses surgically or percutaneously, depending on
circumstances.
The overall prognosis is generally good.

Gas gangrene
A spreading and necrotizing infection within muscle, characterized by
severe systemic illness, muscle pain, and crepitus due to gas
formation. Gas gangrene is generally caused by Clostridium
perfringens, which produces toxins that cause muscle necrosis. The
infection is acquired through environmental (particularly soil)
contamination of deep wounds involving muscle.

Management
For established gas gangrene, extensive surgical removal of dead
tissue is needed, often with excision of massive areas of muscle (for
trunk wounds) and early amputation (for limb infection).
The effect of the toxin on the whole body means that without
successful treatment, the infection is fatal.
High-dose penicillin is important, but unlikely to be effective
without surgery.

Prevention
Through good wound care/wound debridement.

Septic tenosynovitis
Infections of the tendon sheath occur predominantly in the hand and
the traumatized foot (including the chronically ulcerated).

Aetiology:
as well as common bacteria, tenosynovitis in the nontraumatized
hand can be caused by atypical mycobacteria such as M. marinum,
M. cheloniae, and M. kansasii, and environmental fungi such as
Sporothrix schenkii. If related to trauma or ulceration, a wide range
of organisms may be involved. It can also occur 2° to disseminated
gonococcal infection, sepsis with other bacteria, or M. tuberculosis.

Clinical features:
swelling of one or more fingers, palm, or dorsum of the hand.
Swelling in the foot can be minimal if fluid drains via an ulcer.

Diagnosis:
can be clinical, confirmed by surgery, or made with ultrasound or
MRI.

Management
Generally requires drainage of the involved tendon sheath — to
control the infection and to prevent adhesions and long-term
stiffness.
Tendons heal slowly if exposed — soft tissue or skin cover is
important.
See Table 15.1 for antibiotics: for pyogenic infections, treat for 24 weeks; for mycobacterial or fungal infections, use standard
courses for the pathogen.

Septic arthritis
Bacteria infect the joint by blood spread or by direct inoculation
(trauma, ulceration, or iatrogenic). Bacterial multiplication in the

joint leads to acute inflammation — this causes destruction of articular
cartilage and resorption of exposed bone, resulting in deformity,
chronic osteomyelitis, and even joint fusion. Bacteraemia and
septicaemia may occur. If pus tracks and discharges externally, a sinus
is formed.

Clinical features
Although most cases of acute or chronic infection involve a single
joint, multiple joint involvement occurs in 5-10% of cases.
Acute septic arthritis: fever, pain, and loss of function. The joint is
highly irritable; the patient resists both active and passive
movement. Usually, the joint is obviously swollen, warm, and tender
to touch, with little or no erythema unless accompanied by bursitis
or cellulitis.
Chronic septic arthritis: swollen and painful joint, but little systemic
illness. There may be obvious deformity or crepitus from gross joint
destruction.

Complications
Without timely and effective treatment, joint destruction ensues.
There may be osteomyelitis, septicaemia, and — in the young child —
growth plate disturbances leading to deformity or limb length
discrepancy. Complications are much more likely if treatment is
delayed.

Diagnosis
FBC, CRP, ESR, and biochemistry assess patient's general state but lack
specificity. Plain X-rays determine extent of joint damage. MRI reveals
the extent of bone and soft tissue infection, and aids surgical planning.
Blood cultures are positive in <50%. Microscopy of aspirated synovial
fluid shows neutrophils; bacteria may be seen on Gram stain; cultures
often positive if antibiotics have not been previously given.

Management

Systemic antibiotics penetrate inflamed joints well. For
uncomplicated infections of normal joints, treat for 2 wks for
streptococci and 3 wks for staphylococci and Gram -ve bacteria.
Even shorter durations of therapy can be used for gonococcal
arthritis. In joints with extensive pre-existing arthritis and exposed
bone, or in compromised hosts (rheumatoid arthritis is a good
example of both), treat for longer.
Infections of the hip and shoulder joints require arthrotomy or
arthroscopic washout.
Infections in other joints can often be managed by a diagnostic tap
before antibiotic therapy, followed by daily aspirates. Proceed to
surgery if it fails to settle within 5 days. There is no place for
continuous irrigation of the joint: this carries the risk of introducing
antibiotic-resistant bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas).
Chronic septic arthritis generally requires surgery.

Causes of bone and joint infections
Skin infections can seed via the bloodstream to give septic
arthritis and acute osteomyelitis.
If ineffectively treated, these acute conditions become chronic
(e.g. when surgery is unavailable and prolonged courses of
antibiotics are unaffordable).
Major cause is injuries on roads and in factories, armed conflict,
and landmine injuries.
Some 1° infections of bone and joint are more common in the
tropics: TB, brucellosis, melioidosis, histoplasmosis, and
blastomycosis.

Organisms causing acute septic arthritis
Staph. aureus — most common in all age groups and all countries.
Haemophilus influenzae — in populations without access to HIB
vaccine.
Beta-haemolytic streptococci of all groups (including Group B in

pregnancy, neonates, and diabetics).
Enterobacteriaciae (e.g. E. coli) — in neonates and elderly.
N. gonorrhoeae — in sexually active individuals.

Organisms causing chronic septic arthritis
The same organisms as acute septic arthritis, plus:
M. tuberculosis.
Brucella.
Occasionally, fungi (e.g. Sporothrix schenkii).

Osteomyelitis
Acute 1° haematogenous bone infection presents in a similar fashion to
acute septic arthritis. Chronic osteomyelitis may follow septic
arthritis, but is also seen in spinal infections (discitis and vertebral
osteomyelitis), fracture-fixation infections, and the diabetic foot.
Organisms causing acute osteomyelitis are largely the same as those
causing acute septic arthritis.

Clinical features
Acute osteomyelitis: fever, localized bone pain, and loss of limb
function. Osteomyelitis can cause septic arthritis, especially in
young children.
Chronic osteomyelitis: chronic drainage from wound or sinus tract,
pain, flares of intercurrent acute infection, impaired function,
and/or chronic ill health. Visible or palpable bone in a wound makes
osteomyelitis highly likely. An orthopaedic implant or an open
fracture with a chronically draining wound is almost certainly
infected.

Diagnosis:
anaemia, ↑WBC, ↑CRP, ↑ESR indicate the ill health of acute or chronic

infection.
X-rays: become abnormal after 7-10 days, as involved bone is
demineralized (lytic areas), attempts to heal (periosteal reaction),
and in parts dies (sclerotic areas). Changes evolve over a few weeks;
the process is aggressive. There may be evidence of loosening of
metalware.
Other imaging: US can show abscesses adjacent to bone and
delineate sinus tracts. CT is useful for assessing bony union, bone
destruction, and sequestrum formation and soft tissue collections.
MRI detects marrow oedema, cortical breaches, sinus tracts, and
soft tissue collections, but is less useful in patients with extensive
metalware or recent surgery.

Treatment
For acute osteomyelitis: give antibiotics (see Table 15.1) for >4
weeks. Use IV, then perhaps oral route. Evaluate need for surgery.
For chronic osteomyelitis: evaluate surgery, patient's general fitness,
and goals of treatment.
Control of intermittent flares — esp. if flares infrequent and respond
to antibiotics. Monitor for progression of bone involvement.
Suppression with long-term antibiotics — if surgery impossible for
technical reasons, unaffordable, or worse than disease. Long-term
antibiotics can lead to drying of sinuses, improvements in general
health, and reductions in pain.
Surgical exploration, debridement, and excision — with subsequent
antibiotics. Aim to remove all dead bone, ensuring the skeleton is
stable and soft tissue covers the bone at the end of surgery. Dead
space inside debrided bone can be filled with muscle, cancellous bone
graft (usually delayed until infection is arrested), or antibiotic-laden
carriers. Antibiotics added to acrylic bone cement will generate very
high local levels. With
expert surgery, >90% of cases can be arrested. However, even without
surgery or antibiotics, spontaneous long-term arrest can occur if

sequestra discharge spontaneously. Many patients can live with their
bone infection for long periods; in some situations, this may be the
best that can be achieved.

Spinal infections
Common causes are Staph. aureus, Brucella spp, and TB. Initial
blood-borne seeding to disc space is followed by involvement of
adjacent vertebral bodies. Paraspinal muscles may also become
involved, with collections (e.g. psoas abscesses). Retropulsion of
disc and inflammatory tissue, or spinal epidural abscess, may
compress the spinal cord, resulting in paralysis.

Clinical features:
unusually severe backache, especially night pain; sudden
paraparesis on a background of back pain and/or fever.

Diagnosis:
plain X-rays may show irregularity and destruction of endplates
adjoining the infected disc space (which becomes reduced in
height). MRI is best investigation. CXR or sputum examination may
provide evidence of TB; the organism may be cultured from blood,
aspirate of paraspinal or disc space abscesses, or guided biopsy of
the disc.

Management
Antibiotics (see Table 15.1). Treat pyogenic infections of the spine
for 6-12 weeks.
Surgery is reserved for cases with acute spinal epidural abscess,
persistent pain, mechanical instability, recurrent infection with
abscess formation, or cord compression.
Patients with spinal TB infection may recover neurologically on antiTB medication, even if presenting with paralysis.

The diabetic foot
The dramatic worldwide increase in type II diabetes has brought an
increase in patients with foot complications. These arise from diabetic

peripheral neuropathy, with or without ischaemia, plus impaired
systemic resistance to infection. A foot ulcer precedes most
amputations in diabetics; most patients undergoing amputation for
non-traumatic causes are diabetic. Good long-term glycaemic control
is important.
Motor neuropathy leads to increased curvature and height of the
arch of the foot, resulting in hyperextension and subluxation at MP
joints, and clawing at the IP joints. This produces pressure on
metatarsal heads, heel and clawed toes, the tips of toes, and over
the PIP joints.
These deformities co-exist with a sensory neuropathy which means
that the patient does not perceive pain until too late (or not at all).
The patient may also sustain penetrating injuries or burns without
knowing.
The autonomic neuropathy results in dry, fissured skin which is more
susceptible to injury and infection.
There is also impaired white cell function.
Peripheral vascular disease, if present, further impairs healing of
ulcers.

Clinical features
Soft tissue infection and loss, draining sinuses with exposed bone,
sometimes necrotizing fasciitis or septicaemia. Purulent drainage
suggests infection, as does erythema, swelling, pain (which often
occurs to some extent, despite neuropathy), and systemic symptoms.

Diagnosis:
Blood tests may show ↑WBC, ↑CRP, ↑ESR, ↑glucose, and ↑creatinine.
Plain foot X-rays may show gas in the soft tissues, bone destruction,
and/or changes consistent with infection or diabetic osteopathy. Serial
X-rays may show progressive changes over weeks. MRI is best imaging.

Management

Assess fever, cardiovascular stability, hydration, and diabetic
control.
Examine sensation, peripheral perfusion (Buerger's test, palpation
of pulses, and Doppler assessment including ankle-brachial
pressure indices), and presence of cellulitis, necrosis, swelling, or
crepitus.
Debride the ulcer to determine its extent. If possible, probe with
a sterile metal probe: palpable bone suggests underlying
osteomyelitis.
See Table 15.1 for antibiotics. Durations: (a) 72 h for amputation
through healthy tissue; (b) 1-2 wks for amputation through
infected soft tissue, without residual infected bone; (c) 4 wks for
amputation or surgery through ischaemic or severely infected soft
tissues, including deep tissue involvement (e.g. tendon sheaths);
(d) 4-6 wks for osteomyelitis, fully resected, with restoration of
soft tissue cover; (e) 6-12 wks for osteomyelitis with residual
infected or dead bone.
Surgery for significant soft tissue necrosis, abscess drainage, or
bone death.
Vascular surgical input if ischaemic; may be able to avoid
amputation.

Prevention
Diabetic foot ulcers often recur without special attention to foot
care and footwear. Appropriate long-term care, with offloading of
pressure points, is also essential to obtain 1° healing of ulcers, even
if not infected. Improve glycaemic control, stop smoking, and
control blood pressure.

Fungal skin infections
Cutaneous infections
Dermatophytoses (tinea): common skin infections caused by fungi,
particularly Trichophyton and Microsporum spp. They cause scaling or

maceration between the toes (tinea pedis); itchy, scaly, red rash with
definite edges in the groin area (tinea cruris); annular lesions with
raised edges (often itchy) anywhere on the body (tinea corporis);
scaling and itching of the scalp with loss of hair (tinea capitis). Treat
with local application of Whitfield's ointment (benzoic acid compound)
or clotrimazole for 2-4 weeks; for severe cases and nail involvement,
use 4-6 weeks of griseofulvin 10 mg/kg PO (alternatives: terbinafine or
itraconazole).
Pityriasis versicolor: a superficial, hypopigmented, macular rash
normally of the upper body. If extensive, can indicate a cause of
chronic sweating (e.g. TB or AIDS). Treat with 2% selenium sulfide
shampoo, Whitfield's ointment, or itraconazole 200 mg PO od for 5
days.
Superficial candidosis: in addition to vaginal and oral infection, C.
albicans can infect moist folds of skin (groin, under breasts, nappy
area of baby) producing a very red rash and skin damage. Treat with
topical nystatin or clotrimazole and keep dry.

Subcutaneous infections
1. Mycetoma (Madura foot): chronic infection of subcutaneous tissue,
bone, and skin that is due to environmental organisms, either fungi
(eumycetes, producing eumycetomas) or bacteria (actinomycetes or
Nocardia spp. producing actinomycetomas), probably introduced into
deep tissue by a thorn. The infecting organisms grow very slowly,
typically forming ‘grains’ that are macroscopic colonies of fungi or
bacteria. Mycetomas commonly occur on the foot or leg, but may
occur anywhere. They start as an area of hard swelling; infection
eventually spreads from subcutaneous tissues to invade and destroy
bone. There is considerable swelling and usually multiple sinus tract
formation, through which grains may discharge, but pain is rarely
severe.

Diagnosis:
On X-ray, underlying bone is expanded, eroded, and ultimately
destroyed. There is some local lymphatic involvement. The cause

needs to be determined by microscopy of the sinus discharge.

Management:
fungal mycetomas rarely respond to systemic antifungals and
frequently require amputation. Actinomycetomas may respond to
streptomycin or rifampicin for 2-3 months plus cotrimoxazole for many
months until there is clinical improvement.
2. Sporotrichosis: Sporothrix schenckii probably enters the
subcutaneous tissue through an abrasion. It may present as a single
ulcer or nodule. In the lymphangitic form, the fungus spreads down the
lymphatics, forming nodules at intervals which may then ulcerate
through to the skin. Chronic lesions may look like psoriasis or a
granuloma.

Treatment:
saturated aqueous solution of potassium iodide mixed with milk, 0.5-1
ml PO tds, increased in small increments to 3-6 ml tds, until 1 month
after clinical resolution. (Alternative: itraconazole 100-200 mg od.)

Skin signs of systemic fungal infection
Systemic mycoses such as histoplasmosis,
blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis,
paracoccidioidomycosis, and other fungal infections
in immunocompromised individuals, often show skin
signs. Such signs include purpura, ulcers, slow
spreading verrucose plaques, nodules, papules,
pustules, and abscesses

Sexually Transmitted Infections
Henrietta Williams
Section editor

Why are sexually transmitted infections
important?
Sexually transmitted infections (STI) may cause both acute symptoms
and long term consequences (including pelvic pain, infertility, tubal
pregnancy, malignancy, pregnancy loss, neurological and
cardiovascular disease, perinatal infections), that may have a
significant impact on the health of both the individual and the
population. The associated stigma may also affect psychological health
and well-being. Prevalence is usually highest among the most
vulnerable and marginalised groups in society, which, combined with
the stigma, contributes to difficulties in accessing health care. Many
STIs also increase the risk of HIV transmission.
Understanding the health consequences of STI for both the individual
and society (including the association with HIV) is critical to the
implementation of effective control policies. The recent increased
understanding of the role of male circumcision in reducing the
transmission of HIV and some STI is also likely to influence public
health initiatives in the future.

Epidemiology and control of sexually

transmitted infections
The May and Anderson equation encapsulates important factors in the
epidemiology of STI. This states that:
R0 = BCD, where:
R0 is the reproductive rate and refers to the number of secondary
cases resulting from an infected individual in a wholly susceptible
community;
B is the probability of an infection being transmitted per sexual
activity;
C is the rate of change of sexual partners;
D is the average duration of infectiousness.
Factors influencing these variables are listed in the table opposite.
The success of public health interventions for control of STIs depends
on reaching certain ‘core groups’ in the community in which a high STI
prevalence is usually associated with frequent changes of partner and
unsafe sexual practices. Such groups include commercial sex workers
(CSW), men who have sex with men (MSM) and sexually active
adolescents.

Challenges in controlling some sexually
transmitted infections
Whilst the above model is effective for bacterial STI such as
gonorrhoea, syphilis and chancroid, control of viral STI (e.g. HSV, HPV)
is more challenging. A lack of curative treatment and poor
accessibility to suppressive treatment results in symptomatic or
asymptomatic viral shedding and ongoing transmission. This is
highlighted by emerging evidence that HSV-2 is now a more common
cause of genital ulceration than chancroid, even in those countries
with high rates of ulcerative STI. The future development of vaccines
is the only feasible option for effective control.

Other essential strategies for the control of STI
include surveillance, legal policies and frameworks, available and
accessible health services, anti-discrimination legislation and other
measures to support those most vulnerable, research and evaluation,
and targeted interventions.

Syndromic management of STI
Where resources allow, rapid, definitive diagnosis and treatment of
STI, together with partner notification, are most effective in reducing
further transmission and reinfection. Where this is not feasible, STI
services focus on syndromic management, using treatment algorithms

designed to cure the most common causes of defined clinical
syndromes. Health care workers (HCWs) are trained to identify these
syndromes by consistent groups of easily recognisable symptoms and
signs.
Syndromic management is only aimed at symptomatic patients and
treatment reflects local antibiotic resistance patterns. To maximise
compliance, directly observed single dose treatment is used whenever
possible. Syndromic management also includes partner notification and

Urethral discharge in men
Urethritis is diagnosed if urethral discharge or an inflamed meatus is
seen on examination, or dried discharge is seen on the penis. Most
common presentation is urethral discharge and dysuria. In men with no

definite signs of urethritis the urethra can be milked to detect the
presence of a discharge. A gloved thumb is placed on the ventral
surface of the base of the penis with the forefinger on the dorsum and
gentle pressure is applied by moving the hand slowly towards the
meatus.

Cause:
The most common pathogens causing symptomatic urethritis in men
are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Less common
are Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas, HSV, Adenovirus and possibly
Ureaplasma urealyticum (biovar 2). In 50% of cases, no causal pathogen
can be identified. Recent evidence suggests sexual behaviour may
predict aetiology, e.g. HSV and Adenovirus are commoner causes of
urethritis in those practising insertive oral sex.

Diagnosis:
If laboratory services are available, a sample of discharge can be air
dried on a glass slide for microscopy and culture. Gram negative
intracellular diplococci suggests N. gonorrhoeae. The presence of >5
PMNs in a Gram smear has traditionally been used to confirm the
presence of urethritis but recent evidence suggests this may not be
sufficiently sensitive and may therefore miss cases.

Management:
includes treatment of the index case, partner notification, and
treatment of contacts. If gonorrhoea cannot be reliably excluded by
laboratory tests, treatment should be for both gonorrhoea and
Chlamydia (
p 610), ideally with single dose treatment to aid
compliance. The index patient should be asked to return if symptoms
persist for >7 days. Persistence suggests failure of treatment or
reinfection from an untreated partner. If reinfection likely, refer for
laboratory investigations to identify less common causative pathogens;
if no laboratory investigations are available treat for trichomoniasis.

Vaginal discharge
The usefulness of vaginal discharge as a symptom in the syndromic
management of STI has recently been questioned. Personal and
cultural factors may influence the subjective interpretation of vaginal
discharge. particularly in Asia, so it is not always a reliable indicator
of cervical infection. Vaginal speculum examination has therefore been
added to the WHO algorithm to confirm the presence of discharge
when feasible. Abnormal vaginal discharge is usually caused by
vaginitis or vaginosis, although mucopurulent cervicitis (often caused
by a sexually transmitted infection) is also a common cause and cannot
be distinguished clinically. Cervical mucus or pus, the presence of
cervical erosions, cervical friability and inter menstrual or post coital
bleeding are more frequent in cervicitis, but do not reliably exclude
vaginitis or vaginosis. Risk assessment has been shown to improve the
specificity of the syndromic management of women with vaginal
discharge by preventing over diagnosis of STI in low risk women. This
assessment takes account of local STI prevalence as well as local
sexual behaviour patterns.

Causes:
Commonly bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and
cervical infection caused by Chlamydia and gonorrhoea; these cervical
infections are frequently asymptomatic. Non-infective causes of
vaginal discharge usually present with a less acute history and include:
malignancy, foreign body, atopic vulvovaginitis and cervical ectropion.

Diagnosis:
History of the discharge and associated symptoms, as well as a risk
assessment (see below). If microscopy is available, a Gram stain for N.
gonorrhoeae from the cervix and a wet prep for Trichomonas from the
vagina may be helpful.

Management:
WHO guidelines suggest risk assessment in syndromic management of
women with a vaginal discharge. If more than one of the following risk
factors are present (and either partner is symptomatic) there is an
increased risk of an STI:
<21 years old.
unmarried.
>1 sexual partner in the last three months.
new partner in the last three months.
current partner with an STI.
All women are treated for endogenous vaginal infections and those at
high risk of an STI are also treated for the common causes of
cervicitis.

Recommended regimens

p 609) and Chlamydia (

Vaginitis
Therapy for bacterial vaginosis (
p 615) and Trichomonas vaginalis
(
p 614), and, if indicated, for Candida albicans (
p 617).

Lower Abdominal Pain
Endometritis, salpingitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
resulting from STI can present with lower abdominal pain (LAP) in
sexually active women. PID may also occur in the absence of STI in
sexually inactive women; in these cases the aetiology is often
polymicrobial and may result from inadvertent introduction of flora
from the lower genital tract during a gynaecological procedure.

Causes:
of PID include Chlamydia and gonorrhoea and, less commonly, genital
mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum). Nonsexually transmitted pathogens responsible for PID include
Actinomyces, TB, anaerobes and Mobiluncus.

Diagnosis:
In addition to LAP, PID commonly presents with fever, vaginal
discharge, deep dyspareunia, menstrual disturbance, and less
commonly nausea and vomiting. Signs include fever, lower abdominal
tenderness, vaginal discharge, uterine tenderness, including pain with
movement of the cervix (cervical excitation) and adenexal tenderness
and/or adenexal masses. However clinical examination has low
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for PID and no reliable noninvasive investigations exist. A low threshold for treatment is
advocated because delayed treatment increases the risk of long-term
sequelae.

Management:
Admit to hospital if severely unwell, for surgical emergencies (e.g.
ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis), during pregnancy, if a pelvic abscess
cannot be excluded, or if outpatient treatment has failed.
Management should include treatment of all possible causes, and
treatment of partners if a STI is likely or confirmed.

Recommended treatment regimens

Outpatient treatment
Single dose therapy for gonorrhoea (
p 609) plus doxycycline 100
mg bd (or tetracycline 500 mg qds) plus metronidazole 400 mg bd for
14 days. Avoid alcohol with metronidazole and tetracyclines in
pregnancy.

Inpatient treatment
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM od for 7 days, plus doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV
bd (or tetracycline 500 mg PO qds) and metronidazole 400-500 mg bd
PO/IV (or chloramphenicol 500 mg PO/IV qds) for 14 days; or
Clindamycin 900 mg IV tds plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg IV tds; or
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bd (or spectinomycin 1 g IM qds) plus
doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV bd (or tetracycline 500 mg PO qds) and
metronidazole 400-500 mg PO/IV bd (or chloramphenicol 500 mg
PO/IV qds).
For all of these regimens treatment should be continued until 2 days
after symptoms have improved and then treatment should be
continued for 14 more days with doxycycline 100 mg PO bd or
tetracycline 500 mg PO qds
If an IUD is present, remove once antibiotics started. Alternative
contraception will be needed and should be discussed.

Scrotal swelling
Scrotal swelling is commonly due to epididymitis. In young, sexually
active men this is usually due to a STI and often associated with
testicular infection/inflammation (epididymo-orchitis).

Testicular torsion:
should always be excluded in patients with a painful swollen scrotum.
Acute torsion is usually accompanied by severe pain, which is worse
when walking and is not relieved by supporting the testicle. Often

there is associated nausea and vomiting. The testicle may be red and
swollen. Urgent surgical exploration is needed as the testicle will not
survive for more than 6 h with a compromised blood supply. Other
causes of scrotal swelling include malignancy and trauma.

Causes:
Chlamydia and gonorrhoea are the most common sexually transmitted
causes of epididymo-orchitis. In men over 35 years of age non-sexually
transmitted pathogens are more common, including E. coli, Klebsiella
spp. or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. TB and Brucella infection may need
to be considered. Associated urethral discharge strongly indicates a
sexually transmitted pathogen.

Management
In addition to treatment for Chlamydia and gonorrhoea if suspected,
management includes bed rest, support of the testicle and pain relief.

Recommended treatment regimens
Treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea (
Chlamydia (
p 611).

p 609) plus treatment of

Genital ulcer
Causes:
Genital ulcer disease often has multiple aetiologies. The commonest
cause in a particular area is influenced by local prevalence of STIs and
HIV. Ulceration caused by syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV),
granuloma inguinale, chancroid and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) cannot
be accurately distinguished clinically. HSV-2 is commoner than
previously realised, even in areas where other causes of genital
ulceration are common. Unusual or atypical presentations are common
in HIV infected patients and syndromic treatment therefore needs to
cover HSV. Secondary bacterial infection of genital ulcers also
frequently occurs.

Diagnosis:
Patients should be offered serological testing for syphilis and HIV;
laboratory diagnosis is otherwise not usually helpful.

Management:
depends on local causes. Counselling includes advice on the window
period for infectivity of HIV and syphilis, and the natural history of HSV
and its transmission. Treatment should always cover syphilis, and
treatment for HSV should be included where possible. Treatment for
LGV, granuloma inguinale and chancroid depends on local prevalence
rates. Advise patient to return for review if lesion not healed in 7
days. Individuals with HSV/HIV co-infection often have persistent
multiple lesions and are at increased risk of transmitting HIV;
conversely HIV negative patients with genital HSV are more
susceptible to contracting HIV infection.

Recommended treatment regimens
Therapy for syphilis (

p 606) plus

Therapy for HSV if available (
Therapy for chancroid (

p 616) plus

p 613) or

Therapy for granuloma inguinale (

p 613) or

Therapy for lymphogranuloma venereum (

p 611).

Inguinal buboes
Inguinal buboes are localised enlarged lymph nodes in the groin that
are tender and sometimes fluctuant. LGV and chancroid are the most
common causes. They are rarely the only signs of a STI and chancroid
in particular is usually associated with a visible genital ulcer.

Recommended treatment regimens

Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bd for 3 days plus either doxycycline 100 mg
PO bd or erythromycin 500 mg PO qds for 14 days.
Treatment may need to be continued beyond 14 days. Fluctuant lymph
nodes can be aspirated through clean skin but should not be incised or
drained as this can delay healing. Biopsy is required for diagnosis if
treatment fails.

Neonatal conjunctivitis
Causes:
Neonatal conjunctivitis can be caused by gonorrhoea, Chlamydia,
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus
spp. N. gonorrhoeae is the most important cause as without
appropriate treatment it can lead to blindness. It is the commonest
cause of neonatal conjunctivitis in many developing countries.

Diagnosis:
A red swollen sticky eye occurs 2-5 days after delivery in gonococcal
conjunctivitis and at 5-12 days in chlamydial conjunctivitis. In practice
treatment should cover both gonorrhoea and chlamydia.

Management
Treatment of gonococcal neonatal conjunctivitis
Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (max 125 mg) IM stat.
Alternatively, if ceftriaxone not available:
Kanamycin 25 mg/kg (max 75 mg) IM stat or
Spectinomycin 25 mg/kg (max 75 mg) IM stat.

Treatment of chlamydial neonatal conjunctivitis
Erythromycin syrup 50 mg/kg PO daily in 4 divided doses for 14 days or
Trimethoprin 40 mg with sulphamethoxazole 200 mg PO bd for 14 days.

Prevention:
Neonatal infection with gonococcus can be prevented by washing
carefully at the time of birth and applying 1% silver nitrate solution or
1% tetracycline ointment to the eyes. This is recommended for all
babies born to mothers who are at high risk of gonorrhoea. This
regimen however provides little protection from Chlamydia, which
may also be present.

Syphilis
A worldwide disease caused by the spirochaete Treponema pallidum.
The disease can be divided into four stages:
Local primary infection.
Dissemination, associated with 2° syphilis.
A latent period during which infectivity is low (relapses into 2°
syphilis may occur during the 1st 4 years after contact — the early
latent period).
Late syphilis, which occurs after many years with widespread gumma
formation (granulomatous lesions with a necrotic centre and
surrounding obliterative endarteritis) and long-term damage to the
cardiovascular and central nervous systems.

Transmission:
is almost exclusively through abraded skin at sites of sexual contact
with infected persons. Other modes include congenital transmission
(which produces severe disease in the infant) and infection by blood
transfusion.

Clinical features
1° syphilis:
9-90 days after infection a primary genital ulcer or chancre forms. This
is typically solitary, ‘punched out’, indurated, and painless, with a

clear exudate. Atypical lesions occur and there may be multiple ulcers
in HIV co-infected patients. Lesions, which are highly infectious, an
resolve over a few weeks There is painless regional lymphadenopathy.

2° syphilis:
coincides with the greatest number of treponemes in the body and
blood, 1-6 months after contact. Specific features include:
A transient, variable (but not vesicular) rash, particularly on the
trunk, soles, and palms.
In warm, moist areas where two skin surfaces are in contact (e.g.
perineum), the papules enlarge and coalesce to form highly
infectious plaques called condylamata lata.
Silver-grey lesions with red periphery on mucosal surfaces called
mucous patches (e.g. snail track ulcers in the mouth).
There is also:
Low-grade fever.
Malaise.
Generalized lymphadenopathy.
Arthralgia.
Occasionally, focal involvement of eyes, meninges, parotid glands,
or viscera (kidney, liver, GI tract).
Symptoms of secondary syphilis generally resolve spontaneously
within 12 months.

Late syphilis:
Areas of local gummatous tissue destruction in skin, bones, liver, and
spleen are most common. Other cardiovascular and CNS manifestations
include:
Ascending aortic aneurysm ± aortic regurgitation.
Coronary artery stenosis.

Chronic meningitis — cranial nerve defects, hemiparesis, seizures.
CNS parenchymal disease (general paralysis of the insane, GPI) —
psychoses, dementia, hyperactive reflexes, tremor, speech, and
pupillary disturbances (Argyll-Robertson pupils).
Tabes dorsalis — shooting pains in limbs, peripheral neuropathy,
ataxia, Charcot's joints, positive Romberg's sign.

Congenital Syphilis
Transplacental infection may occur during any stage of syphilis, but
is most likely during the early stages. Foetal infection may lead to
late abortion or still birth (<10%). Neonatal features of congenital
infection include rhinitis, a diffuse maculopapular, desquamative
rash involving palms and soles (may be vesicular/bullous),
hepatosplenomegally, lymphadenopathy, generalized
osteochondritis/periostitis, CNS involvement, anaemia, jaundice,
and thrombocytopaenia, although any organ may be affected and
some newborns are asymptomatic. Death may occur e.g. due to
pneumonia, liver failure, pulmonary haemorrhage or
hypopituitarism.
In those children who survive the neonatal period, infection
normally becomes latent, but there may be characteristic chronic
signs and sequelae involving the bones (frontal bossing, saddle nose,
protruding mandible, short maxilla, saber tibia), joints (recurrent
arthropathy and effusions), teeth (peg shaped upper incisor's —
‘Hutchinson's teeth’), eyes (interstitial keratitis), and neurological
system (neurosyphilis, deafness).

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is often clinical, supported by routine bloods, Xrays (look
for raised periosteum on plain X-rays of the long bones), VDRL/RPR
on blood and CSF, ± specific serology and/or PCR if available. Test
the mother. Treatment is cheap and safe, so all children born to
infected mothers should be treated empirically, even if mother
received treatment during pregnancy.

Treatment
Early congenital syphilis (≤2 years of age) and infants with abnormal

CSF:
either aqueous benzyl penicillin 100,000-150,000IU/kg/day
administered as 50,000IU/kg IV bd for the first 7 days of life and
then tds for a total of 10 days.
or procaine benzylpenicillin, 50,000IU/kg IM od for 10 days.
Congenital syphilis of ≥2 years:
aqueous benzylpenicillin, 200,000-300,000IU/kg/day, administered
as 50,000IU/kg IV/IM every 4-6 h for 10-14 days.
Penicillin allergic patients: Penicillin is the treatment of choice in
infants with congenital syphilis and alternatives should only be
considered if there is a significant allergy to this antibiotic. An
alternative (after the first month of life) is:
Erythromycin 7.5-12.5 mg/kg PO qds for 30 days.

Diagnosis
Dark field microscopy of lesion exudates for motile spirochaetes.
PCR and fluorescence staining of exudates increasingly available —
may be more appropriate for oral/GI specimens because of potential
confusion with commensal spirochaetes on dark field microscopy.
Serology: either treponeme-specific (FTA, TPHA) for exposure, or
non-specific (VDRL, RPR) for active disease and screening. An
enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect anti-treponemal IgG and IgM is
also available: IgM usually detectable towards the end of 2nd week,
and IgG in 4th or 5th week, of primary infection.
CSF examination should be performed in any patient with
neurological symptoms or signs. and in asymptomatic patients with
syphilis for >2 years. The CNS can be involved in any stage of
syphilis.
HIV testing should be offererd to all patients with syphilis since dual
infection is common and has implications for assessment and
management.

Management
Early syphilis (stages 1 and 2 or latent syphilis of <2 years' duration):
either benzathine benzylpenicillin 2.4 million IU IM stat (usually
given as two injections into separate sites because of the large
volume).
or procaine benzylpenicillin 1.2 million IU, IM od for 10 days.
For penicillin-allergic patients alternatives include:
either tetracycline 500 mg PO qds for 14 days.
or doxycycline 100 mg PO bd for 14 days.
or erythromycin 500 mg PO qds for 14 days for penicillin allergic
pregnant patients.
Follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months to assess treatment and possible
reinfection.
Late syphilis (not neurosyphilis; includes latent syphilis of >2 years' or
indeterminate duration):
either benzathine benzylpenicillin 2.4 million IU IM (given as two
injections into separate sites) once weekly for 3 weeks.
or procaine benzylpenicillin 1.2 million IU IM od for 20 days.
For penicillin-allergic patients, alternatives include the following
(however penicillin is preferred therapy and should be given whenever
possible):
either tetracycline 500 mg PO qds (probably better).
or doxycycline 100 mg PO bd, both for 30 days.
or erythromycin 500 mg PO qds for 30 days.

Neurosyphilis
either aqueous benzylpenicillin 2-4 million IU IV q4 h for 14 days.
or procaine benzylpenicillin 1.2 million IU IM od plus probenecid 500

mg PO qds for 10-14 days: ensure patient compliance with this
outpatient regimen.
For penicillin-allergic patients, alternatives include:
either tetracycline 500 mg PO qds for 30 days.
or doxycycline 200 mg PO bd for 30 days.
Consult a neurologist if possible and follow up carefully.

Management of syphilis in pregnancy
Pregnant women should be treated with penicillin whenever possible.
Pregnant women who are allergic to penicillin, but whose allergy is not
manifested by anaphylaxis, may be given an extended course of a 3rd
generation cephalosporin. Alternatives include erythromycin 500 mg
PO qds for 14 days (early syphilis) or 30 days (other forms of syphilis).
Note that the effectiveness of erythromycin is highly questionable,
particularly for neurosyphilis, and many failures have been reported.
Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy. The baby should be
evaluated and treated soon after birth.

Gonorrhoea
Gonorrhoea results from infection with the Gram-negative coccus
Neisseria gonorrhoeae. 1° infection through sexual contact usually
involves the mucosal surfaces of the urethra, cervix, rectum, and
oropharynx.
Without early effective treatment, both local and disseminated
complications occur. Recent decades have seen the rise in strains
resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, and other antibiotics.
Conjunctival infection of neonates during vaginal delivery is a serious
condition that may cause blindness if not treated early.

Clinical features:
in men, urethral discharge and dysuria occur 2-5 days after infection.
The discharge is initially mucoid, but becomes profuse and purulent (in

contrast to non-gonococcal urethritis). Local complications include
acute epididymitis, prostatitis, periurethral abscess, and urethral
stricture. In women, infection produces signs of cervicitis (± urethritis)
after ~10 days incubation period — vaginal discharge, dysuria, and
intermenstrual bleeding. However, unlike men, many women are
asymptomatic. Local complications include PID and peri-hepatitis.
Frequency and urgency are uncommon symptoms in both men and
women.
Haematogenous dissemination is a rare complication in untreated
patients, which may → meningitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, sepsis,
or acute destructive monoarthritis. Reactive polyarthropathy and
papular/pustular dermatitis are recognized complications.

Diagnosis:
Gram-negative intracellular diplococci in smears from the urethra in
men (>90%) and endocervix in women (less reliable); culture.

Management:
Resistance to pencillin, tetracyclines and the fluoroquinolones is
increasing worldwide. As yet there appears to be no significant
resistance identified to 3rd generation cephalosporins or
spectinomycin. Local patterns of resistance must be considered when
treating gonococcus. See box opposite for recommended regimens.
Unless facilities available to exclude chlamydial infection, all patients
should also be treated for Chlamydia since they often coexist. Treat
sexual partners at the same time.

Locally recommended regimens:
1. Uncomplicated infection:
2. Pharyngeal infection:
3. Disseminated infection:
4. Gonococcal conjunctivitis:
5. Pregnant patients:

Recommended regimes
In uncomplicated genital and anal infection
Cefixime 400 mg PO stat or
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO stat (not during pregnancy) or
Azithromycin 2 g PO stat or
Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM stat or
Spectinomycin 2 g, IM stat or
Kanamycin 2 g IM stat or
Co-trimoxazole 480 mg 10 tablets od for 3 days.
Always use the locally recommended regimen.

In disseminated infection
Ceftriaxone 1 g IV/IM od for 7 days or
Spectinomycin 2 g IM bd for 7 days.
Extend treatment to 14 days in meningitis, and 28 days in
endocarditis.

Gonococcal conjunctivitis in adults is highly contagious.
Manage with barrier nursing, frequent saline irrigation and
antibiotics:
Ceftriaxone 125 mg IM stat or
Spectinomycin 2 g IM stat or
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO stat
(If above not available, alternative is kanamycin 2 g IM stat).

Neonatal gonococcal conjunctivitis
(

p 22,

p 603)

Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg (max 125 mg) IM stat
[Alternative: Kanamycin 25 mg/kg (max 75 mg) IM stat]
[Alternative: Spectinomycin 25 mg/kg (max 75 mg) IM stat]
Neonatal patients should be reviewed at 48 h.

Chlamydial infections
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium. Serovars
D-K cause infection of the urethra, endocervix, or rectum and may →
upper genital tract infection in women and epididymo-orchitis in men;
less commonly these serovars can also cause conjunctivitis, arthritis
and peri-hepatitis. Serovars L1-L3 cause Lymphogranuloma venereum.
Serovars A-E are not sexually transmitted, but are an important cause
of blindness worldwide due to trachoma (see chapter 13).

1. Uncomplicated
urethritis/endocervicitis/proctitis
The D-K serotypes of chlamydiae have become the most common STI in
the developed world. They are prevalent throughout the world,
frequently coexisting with gonococcal infections, and are the most
common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men.
Complications in men include epididymitis and (in homosexually active
men) chronic proctitis. Infection in women is often subclinical or nonspecific but may be associated with cervicitis, salpingitis, and
endometritis, and is a major cause of female subfertility worldwide.
Screening asymptomatic women at risk of infection should reduce
complications. Nucleic acid amplification tests that do not require
cervical or urethral swabs are now widely available and a reliable way
of case detection in asymptomatic infected individuals. These tests
have now replaced culture and other testing techniques in many parts
of the world, especially for screening purposes. Single dose treatment
(directly observed where possible) for uncomplicated genito-urinary
infection (azithromycin 1 g) is the preferred option in most situations.
This eliminates the need for a test of cure as compliance is not an
issue; effectiveness is excellent with cure rates as high as 90%, and
resistance has not been documented.

2. Complicated Chlamydial Infections
Salpingitis, endometritis and other upper genital tract infection in
women or epidiymo-orchitis in men resulting from Chlamydia

trachomatis infection requires longer courses of treatment. Standard
treatment is doxycycline 100 mg PO bd for 2 weeks ± azithromycin 1 g
PO stat (see under syndromic management).

3. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)
LGV is a chronic STI caused by the L1, 2, and 3 strains. The 1° lesion is
a painless genital ulcer (rarely visible in women) that heals in a few
days. After a latent period of days to months, acute, fluctuant inguinal
lymphadenopathy (buboes) develops. With time, the buboes may
spread locally and ulcerate → sinuses/fistulae. Subsequent chronic
blockage of lymphatic drainage results in genital lymphoedema which
is often quite severe in women. Although LGV has long been endemic
in many parts of the world a recent epidemic has been seen amongst
MSM in Europe and other developed countries. Most of these men have
also been infected with HIV.

Diagnosis
is by EIA, immunofluorescence (IF), DNA probe, PCR, or culture of bubo
aspirate to demonstrate the organism, or by specific IF serological
testing. Complement Fixation (CF) serological testing is helpful if there
is a ≥4 fold rise in titre or a single titre of >1:64; a negative CF test
rules out the diagnosis. Specific serovars responsible for LGV can be
identified in some laboratories which may help with diagnosis.

Treatment
doxycycline or tetracycline for 2 weeks (see box below). In LGV
fluctuant lymph nodes should be aspirated through healthy skin.
Incision and drainage or excision of nodes will delay healing and is
contraindicated (late sequelae such as stricture/fistula, however, may
require surgical intervention). Partner notification and treatment for
all sexually transmitted infections is important.

Antibiotics regimens for chlamydial infection
Uncomplicated anogenital infection:
Doxycycline 100 mg PO bd for 7 days or

Azithromycin 1 g PO stat
(Alternatives: amoxicillin 500 mg PO tds for 7 days or
erythromycin 500 mg PO qds for 7 days or ofloxacin 300 mg PO bd
for 7 days or tetracycline 500 mg PO qds for 7 days).

Uncomplicated anogenital infection during pregnancy:
Erythromycin (base/ethylsuccinate) 500 mg PO qds for 7 days or
amoxicillin 500 mg PO tds for 7 days.

LGV:
Doxycycline 100 mg PO bd for 14 days or
Erythromycin 500 mg PO qds for 14 days
(Alternative: tetracycline 500 mg PO qds for 14 days).

Neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis
Erythromycin syrup 50 mg/kg per day in 4 divided doses for 14
days.
(Alternative: co-trimoxazole 240 mg PO bd for 14 days).
Recommended regimens are those NOT in brackets.

Chancroid
An acute STI caused by Haemophilus ducreyi characterized by painful
necrotizing ulceration and painful bubo formation; highly infectious
and a common cause of genital ulcers in Africa and S.E. Asia.
Chancroid is much more common in males, suggesting a female carrier
state.

Clinical features:
3-7 days post-infection, painful papules form which rapidly develop
into soft ulcers with undermined, ragged edges. Ulcers are
haemorrhagic and sticky (often secondarily infected); if multiple they
may become confluent; they occur at sites of trauma during
intercourse (extra-genital ulcers are rare). 7-14 days later inguinal
nodes may become involved: painful, matted, and tethered to

erythematous skin = bubo. A discharging sinus may develop, in time
becoming a spreading ulcer. Lesions heal slowly and commonly relapse.

Diagnosis:
clean the ulcer with saline, then remove material from the
undermined edge; or aspirate pus from bubo. Gram stain the smear. H.
ducreyi are Gram -ve rods (fine, short, round-ended) sometimes seen
in ‘shoal-of-fish’ or ‘railroad track’ formation. Beware contaminating
organisms. Culture is difficult. PCR, immunofluorescence and serology
may be available for diagnosis in some laboratories. Without
treatment infectivity may continue for several months, but with
appropriate antibiotic therapy (see box) lesions often heal in 1-2
weeks. Intercourse should be avoided until lesions have completely
healed.

Granuloma inguinale (donovanosis)
Calymmatobacterium granulomatis
causes chronic, destructive ulceration of genitals and surrounding
tissues. Males are more frequently infected than females. It is not
easily transmitted; patients' sexual partners are often uninfected.

Clinical features:
1-6 weeks following infection a painless indurated papule forms which
slowly develops into a ‘beefy’ granulomatous ulcer with characteristic
rolled edges. The lesion is elevated, well defined, and bleeds easily
with trauma. Usual sites are in the anogenital region, thighs, and
perineum; rarely vaginal (or rectal) lesions may present with PV (or
PR) bleeding. Healing is uncommon without treatment; 2° infection
can follow → painful, destructive lesions, as can squamous cell
carcinoma. Inguinal nodes are not involved unless there is 2° infection.
Subcutaneous granulomas form which may be mistaken for enlarged
lymph nodes (hence the name ‘pseudobubo’) — they may also become
an abscess, discharging via a sinus, or an infected ulcer. Elephantoid
enlargement of genitalia may occur during healing.

Diagnosis:
crush a piece of granulation tissue from the active edge of the lesion
between 2 slides, air dry, and stain with Giemsa or Gram stains. Look
for large mononuclear cells filled with Donovan bodies (intracytoplasmic Gram -ve rods that look like closed safety pins due to
bipolar staining). Culture is difficult; PCR and serology are available in
some research facilities. Treatment should be for at least 3 weeks or
until all the lesions have epithelialized.

Management of chancroid
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bd for 3 days or
Erythromycin 500 mg PO qds for 7 days or
Azithromycin 1 g PO stat or
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM stat.
Single dose treatments may have higher failure rates than longer
courses of antibiotics, so erythromycin is the treatment of choice.
With HIV co-infection treatment is less effective. Co-infection
syphilis and HSV may occur.

Management of granuloma inguinale (donovanosis)
Azithromycin 1 g PO stat then 500 mg od.
Doxycycline 100 mg PO bd.
(Alternatives: erythromycin 500 mg PO qds or tetracycline 500 mg
PO qds or co-trimoxazole 960 mg PO bd).
Duration of treatment: should be for atleast 3 weeks, continuing
until all lesions have completely epithelialized.

Trichomoniasis
Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis produces an irritating, pruritic
(rarely foul smelling) discharge 5-28 days post-infection, ± dyspareunia.
Urethral infection with dysuria. The vaginal discharge is often copious,
sometimes yellow or green, and pools in the posterior fornix. The

vagina and ectocervix become inflamed; colposcopy reveals cervical
haemorrhages in ~50% of symptomatic cases — ‘strawberry cervix’ (can
be seen on speculum examination in >5% of women with
trichomoniasis). Up to 50% of women with Trichomonas infection may
be asymptomatic. Infection in men is usually asymptomatic but may
cause urethritis.
Diagnosis in women is by wet prep microscopy of vaginal discharge for
motile Trichomonas vaginalis (sensitivity 40-80%). Culture of vaginal
discharge for has a sensitivity of ~80-90%. Pap smears often identify
Trichomonas, but this is not a reliable method of diagnosis as there is a
significant risk of both false negatives and false positives.
Diagnosis in men is not as easy. Trichomonas commonly results in
urethritis in men but urethral swabs, urethral smears and first catch
urine specimen are not sensitive in making a diagnosis. Often
Trichomonas infection in men is only suspected and treated once other
causes of urethritis have been excluded.

Management
Metronidazole 2 g PO stat or 400-500 mg PO bd for 7 days works well
(efficacy of a single dose is less clear).
Tinidazole 2 g PO stat is an alternative.
All sexual partners should be notified and treated.
Patients should return after 7 days if symptoms persist. Failure can
be due to resistance or reinfection. Patients often respond well to
retreatment with the 7-day regimen.
Refractory infections should be treated with metronidazole 2 g PO od
plus 500 mg applied intravaginally each night for 3-7 days.
During pregnancy, metronidazole may only be used at the minimum
effective dose during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters (2 g PO stat).

Bacterial vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of vaginal discharge. It is

characterized by a reduction in hydrogen peroxide producing
lactobacilli and an increase in other bacteria in greater amounts than
are normally present in the vagina. These bacteria include Gardnerella
vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Bacteroides, Mobiluncus,
peptostreptococci and a newly identified bacterium Atopobium
vaginae. Clinically, most women complain of an offensive whitish
discharge that tends to recur and may often seem worse after
intercourse. There are usually no associated symptoms of vaginitis
(itch or irritation). BV in non-pregnant women is associated with
postpartum endometritis and surgical procedures e.g. hysterectomy,
termination of pregnancy. In pregnancy, it can be associated with
chorioamnionitis and amniotic fluid infection, increased rates of foetal
loss (all stages of pregnancy), premature rupture of membranes, low
birth weight and preterm birth. BV increases susceptibility to and
transmissibility of HIV.

Diagnosis
is by microscopy and culture plays no part. Amsells criteria for
diagnosis suggest 3 of 4 of the following need to be present for
diagnosis: white homogenous vaginal discharge; vaginal pH >4.5;
presence of clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells stippled with bacteria,
>20%); and a fishy smell on addition of KOH to a sample of the vaginal
discharge.

Management
Metronidazole 400 mg PO bd for 7 days. A single dose of
metronidazole 2 g is an alternative if adherence is likely to be poor.
Clindamycin cream 2% intravaginally bd for 7 days can be used as an
alternative.
Partners are not routinely treated as it is a polymicrobial condition
and not technically a STI.
Women often suffer from recurrence — up to 30% at 3 months and 90%
at 9 months. The trigger for the reduction in hydrogen peroxide
producing lactobacilli in the vagina of some women is not understood.

There is no evidence on the optimal management of recurrent BV. For
problematic, recurrent BV, expert opinion suggests 14 days of
metronidazole and intravaginal clindamycin 2% followed by monthly 2
g doses of metronidazole and intravaginal acigel may be of benefit.
Pregnant women who are symptomatic should be treated. It is unclear
whether treating asymptomatic pregnant women improves pregnancy
outcomes.

Genital herpes
Most genital herpes worldwide is caused by HSV-2, although primary
genital herpes infections as a result of HSV-1 are increasing. Recurrent
genital ulcers are due to reactivation of the latent virus from the
dorsal root ganglia, and occur more frequently with HSV-2 than HSV-1
infection. Asymptomatic shedding is common and is an important
cause of transmission: most infections are transmitted by people
unaware they are infected. HSV seropositivity increases both the
likelihood of transmitting HIV and susceptibility to HIV. Persistence of
HSV ulceration and frequent recurrences are common in those who are
immunocompromised, and acute episodes are more often prolonged,
clinically atypical and severe.
Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected genital secretions.
After an incubation period of 2-7 days, local infection and
inflammation result in multiple vesicular lesions that rapidly ulcerate.
The ulcers are greyish and extremely painful; they occur on the penis
in men and the vagina, cervix, vulva, and perineum in women, often
accompanied by a vaginal discharge. The ulcers may be present in the
anus (usually in homosexually active men). 1° infection is accompanied
by fever, malaise, and inguinal lymphadenopathy; extragenital
involvement occurs in up to 20% of cases. Encephalitis is a recognized
complication of genital herpes. Non-primary initial infection (e.g. HSV2 infection with pre-existing antibodies to HSV-1) is often less severe
clinically.
Diagnosis PCR, culture, direct immunofluorescence and serology are
used. In many parts of the world where laboratory resources are
accessible PCR has replaced culture and immunofluorescence as the
primary method for diagnosis. Recent reliable Western blot type-

specific serological tests are now available and may play a part in the
diagnosis of genital ulcers. These tests may also be useful for
discordant couples, as part of preconception counselling.

Management
Analgesia and salt baths may help relieve discomfort and pain
associated with primary infections.
In those with a first clinical episode (take a careful history),
aciclovir 200 mg PO 5 × daily for 5 days or valaciclovir 500 mg bd for
5 days reduces formation of new lesions, duration of pain, time
required for healing, and viral shedding—but probably not the rate of
future recurrence. Treatment should be started as soon as possible.
Recurrences can be managed with either episodic treatment or
suppressive treatment. Aciclovir 200 mg PO 5 × daily or valaciclovir
500 mg bd or famciclovir 125 mg bd, all for 5 days, can be used
episodically. If >6 episodes per year give continuous oral suppressive
treatment with aciclovir 400 mg bd, famciclovir 250 mg bd or
valaciclovir 500 mg od; if >10 episodes per year use valaciclovir 1 g
od. Recurrences become less common with increasing duration, so
some experts recommend stopping antivirals after 1 year so that
recurrence rates can be reassessed. The minimum continuous dose
that will suppress recurrence should be determined empirically.
Condoms can reduce transmission; long-term suppressive treatment
with valaciclovir also appears to reduce transmission.

Candida vaginitis
Candida vaginitis is not an STI. It occurs due to overgrowth of the
commensal vaginal yeast, Candida albicans (and less commonly other
candida species). Antibiotic therapy, pregnancy, and
immunosuppression all predispose to symptomatic candidiasis.
Commonly there is vulvitis as well as vaginitis and intense vulval
pruritus and erythema are characteristic. Discharge is thick, curd-like,
and white (rarely it may only be scanty), and microscopy shows Gram
+ve budding yeasts ± hyphae; visualization of the yeasts is made easier

by the addition of 10% KOH to clear the epithelial cells.
Recurrent vulvo-vaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is defined as more than 4
episodes of microbiologically proven candida infection in a 12 month
period. 5-8% of women in their reproductive life have RVVC. The
majority of women have no demonstrable risk factors and it may be
due to a cell mediated immunodeficiency at the vaginal mucosal level.
Men can suffer from candida balano-prostitis, but this is not as a result
of transmission between partners, and treatment of partners is not
generally helpful unless the male partner is symptomatic.

Management
Miconazole or clotrimazole 200 mg intravaginally od for 3 days or
Clotrimazole 500 mg intravaginally stat or
Fluconazole 150 mg PO stat.
(Alternative: nystatin 100,000IU intravaginally od for 14 days).
Women with RVVC can be treated with a 2 week induction course of
clotrimazole followed by weekly maintenance treatment with
clotrimazole 500 mg as a pessary for 3-6 months.
Occasionally candida vaginitis may be caused by a strain of Candida
albicans resistant to routine treatment, or to less common Candida
species such as C. glabrata or C. kruseii.

Genital Warts
Genital warts are caused by infection with human papilloma virus
(HPV) transmitted by skin to skin contact. There are more than 100
serotypes of HPV based on genomic DNA sequences and 35 serotypes
preferentially infect the anogenital area. Serotypes 6 and 11 are
typically responsible for warts and rarely insert themselves into the
host genome. Infection with these types has no malignant potential. By
contrast the oncogenic types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35 and 45) may integrate
with the host genome and can eventually result in cervical squamous
cell carcinoma if infection is persistent and other cofactors are also
present. These oncogenic types do not cause genital warts.

Genital wart virus infection (GWVI) is common and prevalence rates
amongst sexually active populations may be as high as 50%. However
not all GWVI (even with low risk types) results in warts as many of
those infected will have subclinical infection. There may be evidence
of infection histologically or on colposcopy, however. HPV typing on
clinical specimens is available in some countries.

Management
Genital warts are a cosmetic problem and, although the natural
history is for them to resolve spontaneously, treatment is often
requested. Treatment options include the following (application of
topical treatments can often be done by the patient themselves):
Cryotherapy ablation with liquid nitrogen.
Surgical excision.
Laser treatment.
Podophyllotoxin cream or liquid (an antimitotic) can be applied to
accessible warts twice daily in cycles of three days a week for a
maximum of 4 weeks. Local irritation is a common side effect.
Imiquimod is a new topical treatment that induces the production of
local cytokines and is associated with a lower recurrence rate than
other treatments. It should be applied once daily three times a week
for up to 16 weeks.
Cervical warts are best treated by cryotherapy after colposcopic
examination. Warts can be resistant to treatment and cause
problematic recurrences in pregnancy and in patients who are
immunocompromised.
Infection with oncogenic type HPV resulting in squamous
intraepithelial lesions is best identified treated and followed up by
colposcopy and regular Pap smears.

Prevention
Vaccines against HPV serotypes 16 and 18 (two of the commonest

causes of cervical squamous cell carcinoma) are now available, and
have shown excellent efficacy in preventing the ‘precancerous’ stage
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). One of the vaccines also
targets serotypes 6 and 11 (together responsible for most genital
warts).

Molluscum Contagiosum

P.620

Molluscum contagiosum virus infection produces raised umbilicated
lesions or nodules with pearly caseous plugs. They are transmitted
through skin contact and are common in immunocompetent children
and adults but may be particularly severe in the immunocompromised.
In children, lesions are usually non-genital and are transmitted through
fomites or direct skin-to-skin contact. In adults, lesions can be in the
genital region and more widespread. Treatment is usually for cosmetic
reasons and can be difficult in those who are immunocompromised.
Cryotherapy or immune modulators such as imiquimod or
podophylotoxin can be used, or the lesion can be pricked with a sterile
point and the contents expressed. Antiretroviral therapy usually leads
to a marked improvement in HIV.

Scabies
Scabies is caused by infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabei.
Infection is from skin-to-skin contact and can affect any part of the
body. In the genital region it is often papular and nodular, with crusting
and excoriation. Intense itching at night is common. Scrapings from a
nodule or burrow may produce mites that can be identified under the
microscope. See
p 545 for treatment. Repeat treatments may be
required; bedding must be washed.

Pubic Lice
In Phthirus pubis infestation (see also
p 544) eggs are attached
firmly to pubic hair and the louse itself may be found on the abdomen,
thighs, genital area or eyelashes. The louse is often difficult to see by
the naked eye but can be placed under the microscope for
confirmation of the diagnosis. Permethrin 1% applied to all affected

areas is the treatment of choice. Lice in the eyelashes can be treated
by application of petroleum jelly twice a day for 10 days. Bedding must
be washed and contacts treated.

Malnutrition, health, and survival
Why does malnutrition occur?
Food insecurity, infections, and lack of care all contribute to
malnutrition. Underlying exacerbating causes include trade tariffs,
lack of political commitment, and political instability. Food insecurity
may be acute, chronic, or seasonal. Socio-economics (poverty,
cultural, civil unrest, disasters, social exclusion), climate, geography,
agricultural factors (e.g. soil characteristics), and factors affecting
animal husbandry and health all contribute. Seasonal availability of
cereals, fruit, or vegetables affect dietary intake. Cultural preference,
including gender inequality, determines who gets the best portions of
food. Commercial marketing often affects food choice by children and
adults. Certain cereals have characteristic limited bioavailability of
micronutrients. Infection is frequently implicated. Pain, fever, sore
mouth, breathlessness, and diarrhoea all ↓ appetite. Malnutrition
develops due to a combination of anorexia, poor intake,
malabsorption, ↑ nutrient requirements, and urinary and intestinal
losses. Particularly important infections causing malnutrition are
persistent diarrhoea, measles, pertussis, intestinal parasites,
pneumonia, TB, and HIV/AIDS. Inadequate care often contributes and
is exacerbated by short birth intervals, large family size, sick parents,

and orphanhood.

Effects of malnutrition on health and survival
Immunity: Malnutrition contributes to >50% deaths among children
<5 years globally by suppressing host immunity (particularly cellular
immunity), reducing antioxidant capacity, and slowing tissue repair
after infection. Vit A and Zn deficiency are particularly important
contributors to severe illness and mortality in childhood infection.
Growth and development: Dietary as well as genetic factors affect
growth. Better childhood diet → improved growth and development.
Organ function: Individual nutritional deficiencies affect the eye (vit
A), thyroid gland (iodine), brain (iron), respiratory and intestinal
epithelia (vit A and Zn), and ovaries (anorexia).
Pregnancy outcome: Maternal malnutrition affects maternal health,
intrauterine development, birth weight, lactation, and infant/child
health.
Foetal programming: Intrauterine malnutrition causes ↑ risk of
cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke during
adulthood.

Whose responsibility is nutritional treatment?
Doctors often assume malnutrition is caused by parental ignorance or
cultural preferences and that dietary advice is all that is necessary.
Hospital administrators assume parents can bring the necessary
nutritional diet to the ward. Nurses often focus on the medical aspects
of treating the sick child. Economists assume that if incomes could be
raised and food production could be increased, then malnutrition and
disease would go away. In practice, there are many interventions
needed if malnutrition is to be prevented and treated properly. The
role of health professionals in advocacy for prevention of malnutrition
is vital, but this section deals with the medical response only, requiring
the same rigour of management as a
microbial or metabolic illness. Nutritional treatment plans need
careful prescription of specified amounts of food, medicines, and

nutritional supplements with precise instructions on frequency of
dosing.

Nutritional treatment strategies
Interventions include provision of nutritious, palatable foods,
micronutrient supplements, demonstration of preparation of
complementary foods in the home, improving household food security,
and promotion of fortified foods. Ideally, involve a trained nutritionist;
nutritional guidelines are also available from international agencies
and NGOs (
p 663).

Nutrition & millennium development goals (MDGs)
The MDGs agreed by the UN are supposed to be achieved by 2015.
Achieving adequate nutrition plays a key role in the majority of
MDGs:
Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger: Malnutrition
erodes human capital, ↓ resilience to disease (esp infection), ↓
productivity, and prevents poverty reduction. Early child
malnutrition has consequences for adult health, including an
increased risk of chronic disease. Biological and social
vulnerability overlap and compound each other.
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education: Malnourished
children are more likely to perform poorly in school or not to
enrol in school at all. Nutrition is critical for cognitive
development so malnutrition reduces mental capacity.
Malnutrition may also disable (blindness in vit A deficiency;
impaired mental development in iodine deficiency).
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women: Gender
inequality ↑ risk of female malnutrition. Dealing with malnutrition
improves equality, and better-nourished girls are more likely to
stay in school.
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality: Malnutrition contributes to >50%
child mortality, esp from infection. Breastfeeding, appropriate
complementary feeding, and micronutrients (esp. vit A and Zn)
are keys to child survival.

Goal 5: Improve maternal health: Malnutrition contributes to
maternal mortality. Deficiencies of several micronutrients (iron,
vit A, folate, iodine, calcium, and Zn) are associated with
pregnancy complications. Maternal stunting increases risk of
cephalopelvic disproportion and obstructed labour.
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases: Among HIV
+ve individuals, malnutrition ↑ disease progression, imortality,
and ↓ resistance to opportunistic infections; it may ↓ the efficacy
and safety of ART treatment. Malnutrition ↓ survival in malaria
and TB.

Clinical assessment of malnutrition
Nutritional status is assessed by a combination of clinical features and
anthropometric measurements, (
p 628).

Clinical syndromes
Most cases of severe malnutrition occur in children <5 y old; in older
children or adults, suspect malnutrition 2° to underlying infection (e.g.
HIV, TB) or malignancy. Classically, two syndromes of severe
malnutrition are recognized in children: marasmus and kwashiorkor
(see box, Fig.17.1 and Plate 21). These may be mixed: marasmickwashiorkor. It is unclear why some children develop oedema and
others do not. Dietary deficiencies of energy, protein, and
micronutrients are common to both syndromes. Zinc and selenium
deficiency contribute to impaired anti-oxidant capacity.

Points in the history and physical examination
History
Usual diet before current illness, complaints about lack of food or
the quality of food, recent change in diet.
Breastfeeding history: how long for? Mixed or exclusive BF? Is the
child breastfeeding now?

Is the mother ill or malnourished? Any evidence of TB or HIV/AIDS?
Food and fluids taken in past few days; thirst?
Recent illness (measles, diarrhoea, malaria, cough, etc).
Behaviour and activity changes (crying, irritable, apathy, anorexia).
Duration, frequency, and nature of any vomiting or diarrhoea.
Recent sinking of eyes.
Time when urine was last passed.
Deaths of siblings or parent (esp from HIV/AIDS).
Birth weight; whether a twin.
Milestones reached (e.g. sitting, standing).
Immunization and vit A doses up to date?

Physical examination
General appearance, behaviour, mood (apathy, irritability), level of
consciousness, facial appearance, signs of kwashiorkor/marasmus.
Signs of shock: cold hands or feet, weak pulse, ↓capillary refill time,
↓ consciousness.
Appetite for an offered portion of therapeutic food?
Temperature — hypothermia/fever?
Pulse and respiratory rate.
Pallor, jaundice.
Skin rash (e.g. post measles) or excoriation, cancrum oris.
Oedema.
Enlarged or tender liver, jaundice.
Abdominal distension, tenderness.
Signs of congenital syndrome (e.g. Down's syndrome).
Anthropometric measurements (see

p 628).

Clinical features of marasmus
Emaciated: thin, flaccid skin (‘little old man’ appearance), fat and
muscle tissue grossly reduced, prominent spine, ribs, pelvis.
Behaviour: alert and irritable.

Clinical features of kwashiorkor
Oedema: bilateral pitting limb oedema; periorbital oedema.
Oedema may mislead observer into thinking child is plump and
well, and makes assessment of dehydration much more difficult.
Skin changes: desquamation, often in the flexures and perineum.
Hair changes: dry, thin hair which may become depigmented
appearing brown, yellowy-red, or white.
Hepatomegaly is common.
Behaviour: miserable, lethargic, and apathetic with sad facial
expression.

Fig. 17.1 Signs of marasmus (above) and kwashiorkor (below).

Pathophysiological consequences of severe
malnutrition
Severe malnutrition is associated with impaired function of:
kidneys (unable to excrete Na+ load).
intestine (villous atrophy; gut damage → bacterial translocation; gut
enzyme deficiencies → malabsorption).
circulation (easily develops fluid overload/CCF).
thymus (atrophy → impaired immunity).
brain (impaired intellectual impairment).
liver (hypoglycaemia, abnormal drug metabolism).
electrolyte homeostasis (K+, Zn, and Mg deficiency).
skin excoriation — source of local sepsis and septicaemia.
body temperature control (hypothermia = sign of bad prognosis).

Specific nutrient deficiencies
Classical signs of specific nutrient deficiency occur in severe cases
only. These include nutritional oedema (kwashiorkor), xerophthalmia
(vit A deficiency), goitre (iodine), pellagra (niacin), scurvy (vit C), and
rickets (vit D) — the clinical features and management of these
conditions are described later in this chapter.

Laboratory measures
Where available, the following can be used in the assessment of
nutritional status:
Serum proteins (e.g. albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin).
Micronutrients (e.g. serum retinol, plasma Zn, vit B12, folate,

ferritin).
Erythrocyte enzymes (e.g. erythrocyte glutathione reductase)
indicating functional micronutrient deficiency.
Urinary micronutrients (e.g. iodine).
However, plasma levels of several biomarkers change during
inflammation (plasma Zn and vit A ↓; plasma ferritin ↑) making them
difficult to interpret. Others are more stable e.g. transferrin receptor
and Vitamin D. Plasma Na+ levels are typically low (indicating
dysfunctional Na+ pumps rather than Na+ deficiency). Plasma K+ levels
are typically low (indicating loss of muscle mass and intestinal losses of
K+ in diarrhoea).

Measuring malnutrition

P.628

Anthropometric indices
Anthropometry (body measurements) is used to quantify malnutrition
by reference to international standards (see box). The following are
commonly used:
Weight for age (W/A): weight relative to the standard weight for a
child of the same age.
Height for age (H/A): height relative to the standard height for a
child of the same age.
Weight for height (W/H): weight relative to expected weight for a
child of the same height.
Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC).
Body mass index (BMI): weight/(height)2.
W/A, H/A, and W/H are expressed as % of the reference standard, or as
multiples of the standard deviation (SD) from the mean of a reference
population (see box) = ‘Z score’ (e.g. if weight is 2 SD below the mean
weight of normal children of the same age, the Z score is -2).

Weight for age, height for age, and weight for
height
Malnutrition may be classified using anthropometric measures as
follows:
Underweight:↓ W/A (Z score ≤1 mild; ≤2 mod; ≤3 severe).
Stunting: ↓ H/A (Z score ≤1 mild; ≤2 mod; ≤3 severe).
Acute malnutrition: ↓ W/H (wasting).
Moderate — (‘global acute malnutrition’ or GAM): W/H Z score ≤2
or W/H < 80%.
Severe — (‘severe acute malnutrition’ or SAM): W/H Z score ≤3 or
W/H < 50% W/H or the presence of bilateral oedema.
If age is uncertain, height (65-110 cm) may be used as a proxy for age
to identify children aged 6 months-6 yrs.

Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC)
MUAC is measured simply using a tape or marked plastic strip placed
around the dominant upper arm. Between ages 1-5 years MUAC
increases slowly, so simple cut-off values may be used for nutritional
assessment (see box). A MUAC of <110 cm is equivalent to a W/H Z
score of -3 (i.e. SAM requiring urgent nutritional rehabilitation) A
MUAC of <125 cm is equivalent to a W/H Z score of -2 (i.e. GAM)

Body mass index (BMI)
BMI, defined as weight/(height)2 (in kg/m2) is only used for adults (not
pregnant women, in whom MUAC is used). A BMI <18.5 is ‘mild’, 16-17 is
‘moderate’, and <16 is ‘severe malnutrition’. A BMI >25 is
‘overweight’; >30 is ‘obese’.

Reference growth standards and growth charts
Traditionally, National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth
standards were used for children aged 0-18 years.

In 2006, the WHO introduced new international growth standards for
children aged 0-5 years, which are expected to be widely adopted in
the near future.
For children aged 5-18 years, the WHO still recommends the use of
NCHS standards. Both the NCHS and new WHO growth standards may
be found at www.who.int/nutrition.
Example growth charts and a simplified WHO reference chart are
shown on the following pages 630-1.

Common mistakes with growth charts
Writing January in the first box instead of the child's birth month.
Writing the month in which the child was first weighed instead of
his/her birth month in the first box.
Missing out months.
Writing the months as numbers and confusing them with ages.
Forgetting to miss out blank boxes if the child has not been weighed
for several months.
Not using the calendar and estimating the child's age each time.

Recording a child's weight in the wrong year.
Putting the weight dot the wrong side of the kilogram line.

Managing malnutrition
Initial assessment should include a history, anthropometric
measurements especially MUAC (
p 628), and examination for
specific clinical signs of malnutrition (
p 624). Assess whether the
child appears clinically well, or lethargic and unwell; if well, does
he/she eat well when offered food? Use the algorithm below to classify
the type of malnutrition and decide on type of treatment.

Fig. 17.3 Algorithm for categorization and management of
children with malnutrition.

Outpatient therapeutic nutrition programme

P.634

The aim of an outpatient nutrition programme (see algorithm p. 632) is
to identify the severity of malnutrition; plan a treatment regimen for
those with GAM or SAM; decide where that regimen should be given (in
paediatric ward, at home, or feeding centre); and give advice and
treatment to carers of children with GAM and SAM.

1. Give nutritional guidance to improve dietary
intake
Give advice on specific feeding practices, including need to give

extra food in convalescent phase of an illness and to improve the
protein and micronutrient content of the traditional diet wherever
possible.
Advise on access to local programmes which increase food security
(using local community development programme and/or a local
programme of food supplements).
Provide a ‘take home’ ration of food to provide protein, energy and
micronutrients in a form which is palatable and can be stored safely
without refrigeration (e.g. nutritional pastes).

2. Treat infection (many infections are
subclinical in malnutrition)
Treat all children with SAM for infection whether they have clinical
signs or not (give antibiotics e.g. amoxicillin for 5 days).
Give a single dose of albendazole 400 mg PO to all children >24
months to treat possible helminth infection.
Give all children vit A (50,000, 100,000, and 200,000 iu for those <6
months, 7-12 months, and >12 months respectively, on days 1, 2, and
14 of the nutrition programme).
Assess HIV status and treat.
Diagnose and treat malaria.
Consider TB as cause for poor nutritional response.
Ensure the child is up to date with immunizations.
Follow up the child every 2 weeks until weight gain is achieved.

Outpatient ready-to-use therapeutic food
programme
The aim of this programme is to manage children with SAM at home
provided they can eat adequate amounts of ready-to-use therapeutic
food (RUTF, see box). This enables recovery of metabolic problems and
promotes recovery of body mass and function.

1. Observe that the child eats offered portions
of RUTF
2. Give sufficient RUTF till the next visit
Follow up every 2 weeks until weight gain satisfactory (e.g. >5
g/kg/day).
RUTF contains ~5.5 kcal/g; 200 kcals/kg body weight/day can → a
daily weight gain of up to 20 g/kg body weight.
Advise carer to give up to 100 kcal/kg body weight/day (using
teaspoon equivalents of RUTF) until any oedema has resolved.
If no oedema or once oedema resolved, give 150-220 kcal/kg body
weight/day.
Advise carer of need to feed frequently, to keep child warm
(especially at night), and to come back to the clinic if the child
develops an infection or consistently refuses RUTF.

3. Ensure the carer knows the ration is for the
index child only
RUTF is sometimes shared with other children, reducing the amount
the index child receives. If the intake of RUTF falls to 100-150
kcals/kg body weight, daily weight gain to falls to ~5-10 g/kg body
weight/day.
Best to give cereal/legume supplement to carer of malnoursished
child to ensure other children in the family do not eat RUTF
intended for the index child.

Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF)
RUTF is a protein, energy, and micronutrient-rich food for severely
malnourished children. Typically, RUTFs are very palatable, lipidrich pastes, with a nutritional composition similar to F-100. RUTF
does not require cooking, and the low water content makes it

resistant to microbial contamination, so it can be stored safely at
ambient tropical conditions for many months. Most severely
malnourished children can take several teaspoonfuls of RUTF 5-7
times a day, achieving sufficient nutrient intake to achieve
complete nutritional recovery. RUTF needs to be taken with water.
Encourage breastfeeding. Other foods should not be encouraged
until weight has been restored.

Production:
RUTF can be produced locally. A typical recipe includes (by weight
or volume): full-fat milk powder (30%), sugar (28%), vegetable oil
(15%), peanut butter (25%), and mineral/vit mix (1.6%). Liquid milk is
not suitable as it promotes microbial growth. Suitable oils include
soya, cotton seed, rape seed, and corn oil. Sugar should be ground
to ‘icing sugar’ quality to make the paste less ‘gritty’. Peanut butter
is made by roasting and grinding peanuts. The vit/mineral mix
requires careful formulation; it cannot be provided from local
markets and is best obtained as commercially prepared mixes (e.g.
DSM, S Africa) Mechanical mixers should be used as hand mixing of
ingredients is unlikely to disperse the micronutrients adequately.
Two full-time workers can produce several hundred kgs of
RUTF/week. Mixing/ingredient instructions are available on the
WHO website (www.who.int/nutrition/RUTF).

Quality control:
Avoid aflatoxin contamination by selecting out mouldy peanuts. Do
not add water. Store in airtight containers to ↓ fatty acid oxidation.
Locally produced RUTF has a shelf life of 3-4 months. If packaged in
airtight, foil envelopes, in a nitrogen atmosphere, the shelf life is 24
months. Micronutrient levels in the feed can be measured by
markers of individual components such as iron.

Cost and sustainability:
Locally produced RUTF costs 7US$3.0 per kg (~$2.5 for raw materials
+ ~$0.50 for packaging, salaries, and storage.) Commercially
produced RUTF costs more but lasts longer.

Inpatient therapeutic nutrition programme
Severely malnourished children who are clinically ill or anorexic should
be admitted to hospital. Inpatient management aims to treat serious,
life-threatening metabolic and infective complications of severe
malnutrition and to establish the child on an adequate intake for
nutritional recovery.

Nutritional rehabilitation
While this section concentrates on the management of severe
malnutrition in young children, the principles of treatment are similar
for all age groups, and combine therapeutic nutritional treatment with
intensive medical care (
p 640). Management of infants is covered
on
p 644. Nutritional treatment may be divided into initiation,
transition, and rehabilitation phases.

1) Initiation phase:
Establish maintenance dietary intake using special feeds to enable
metabolic disturbances to recover, and then ↑ to higher nutrient doses.
Severely malnourished children cannot handle large quantities of
dietary protein, fat, or Na+. Start with a low-energy, low-protein
intake to stabilize physiological and metabolic processes; this allows
oedema to clear. Aim to provide 75 kcals/kg body weight and 1.0-1.5
g/kg protein per day using frequent small feeds of low osmolality.
Prevent and treat complications of severe malnutrition (see
640).

p

Use a ‘starter’ feeding regimen containing of F-75 formula (see
637).

p

Give small amounts frequently — ideally 2 hourly, at least 4 hourly
(see Table 17.2). Night feeding is required to prevent hypoglycaemia.
If unable to take sufficient feed orally (<80 kcal/kg body
weight/day), give via NG tube. Offer each feed by mouth and give
remainder via NG. NG may be removed when child takes most of

daily diet orally.
Weigh child each morning before a feed; assess oedema daily.

2) Transition phase:
Once appetite returns, oedema starts to clear and medical
complications are treated (usually after 73-7 days), child may enter
transition phase in which dietary intake ↑ under close monitoring.
Problems can occur with higher dietary Na+ and osmolality. Need to
intervene quickly if heart failure develops 2° to fluid overload:
monitor vital signs. Key components of this phase:
Switch to F-100 therapeutic milk (see

p 646).

Continue to feed regularly (e.g. 8 feeds in 24 h).
Provided appetite remains good, increase successive feeds by 10 ml
until refusal (likely to occur at ≥200 ml/kg/day).
Weigh daily but assess mean weight gain over 3 days.
If <5 g/kg body weight/day: ensure feeds being given properly;
check.
for infection.
If 5-10 g/kg body weight/day: check if greater intake can be
achieved.
If >10 g/kg body weight /day: anticipate early referral to
rehabilitation phase.
Always monitor for heart failure (fast pulse/respiratory rate): ↓
feed if present.

3) Rehabilitation phase:
Once able to tolerate larger quantities of food without complications,
child enters rehabilitation phase, which aims to promote rapid growth.
Preparations for discharge should include careful assessment of the
physical, social, and economic environment of the child and family.
The child should then be referred to an outpatient nutrition
rehabilitation programme, such as the RUTF programme described
above. Key issues during this phase include:
Work towards increasing household food security.

Provide support for families with serious social problems.
Encourage regular visits to under-5 clinics, immunization, and
regular vit A prophylaxis (200,000 m iu 3 times/year).
Encourage sensory stimulation, using structured play therapy and
physical activity to promote speech and motor development.
Promote breastfeeding (see box).
See child regularly (preferably every 2 weeks) until nutritional
recovery is achieved (at least 85% weight/height is regarded as
‘cure’).

4) Follow-up after nutritional recovery
See child every 2 weeks to check weight gain (after nutritional
recovery child should grow at expected 1-2 g/kg body weight/day).
Check for dietary/medical reasons for poor weight gain.
Ensure child is integrated into clinic or community-based programme
for monitoring progress of ‘at risk’ children.

Breastfeeding: key issues promoted by WHO/UNICEF
Have a written breastfeeding policy that is understood by and
routinely communicated to all health care staff.
Train all health care staff in skills necessary.
Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management
of breastfeeding.
Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of birth.
Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation
even if they should be separated from their infants.
Give infants no food and drink other than breast milk, unless
medically indicated — exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months if
possible.
Promote ‘rooming in’: mothers and infants should remain together
24 h a day wherever possible.
Encourage breastfeeding on demand.

Give no artificial teats or pacifiers (also called dummies or
soothers) to breastfeeding infants.
Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups.

Medical management within inpatient
therapeutic nutrition programmes

P.640

Medical management aims to treat infections and metabolic problems
that are especially common in severely malnourished children.

1) Hypoglycaemia:
(blood glucose <3 mmol/l or <54 mg/dl) is often a result of infection
and/or depletion of liver glycogen stores. If untreated, it can →
lethargy, confusion, convulsions, coma, and death. Treat with 2-5
ml/kg 10% glucose IV upon admission, followed by 50 ml 10%
glucose/sucrose PO/NG to prevent recurrence (1 rounded teaspoonful
of sugar in 3.5 tablespoonfuls of water). Further glucose may be
required; close monitoring is required. As consciousness recovers,
begin feeding or give 60 g/l glucose/sucrose in water. Prevent
hypoglycaemia by immediate and frequent feeding on admission and
early treatment of infections.

2) Hypothermia:
(rectal temp <35.5°C) usually occurs if ambient temperature drops
(esp. during the night) and is often associated with infection and/or
hypoglycaemia. It is a dangerous prognostic sign. Change wet nappies
and bedding quickly and ensure child does not get cold during washing.
Provide blankets/lamps/heaters to ensure child is nursed in warm
environment, esp. at night. Encourage ‘kangaroo’ technique: mother
lies supine with child on her chest, covered by her clothes and
blankets. Cover child's head with a cap to ↓ heat loss.

3) Diarrhoea:
is common on admission and during treatment; may be due to

infection, excess osmolarity of the food, or premature transfer to the
next feeding phase. If severe diarrhoea, go back to F-75. Milk
intolerance is uncommon but may require non-milk-based feeds. Check
that correct volumes of feeds are being given rather than large boluses
which may cause diarrhoea. Severely malnourished children with HIV
may have severe diarrhoea from Cryptosporidium or other intestinal
parasites. Oral (and sometimes IV) rehydration is necessary for such
children. Diarrhoea ± fever can be due to systemic infection (e.g.
pneumonia, malaria, otitis media) Current WHO diarrhoea treatment
regimes include the use of Zn preparations (10 mg daily); dysentery
should be treated with antibiotics according to local policies in the
light of microbial resistance — see
p 221.

4) Dehydration:
is difficult to assess. It is easy and dangerous to overhydrate severely
malnourished children — they cannot excrete Na+ load and have
impaired cardiac function. Assessment and management are described
on
p 6 and 248-251. Children should be monitored carefully during
rehydration. Monitor pulse/respiratory rate and urinary frequency.
Useful signs of rehydration include return of tears, moist mouth, less
sunken eyes and fontanelle, and improved skin turgor. Continue
breastfeeding wherever possible.

5) Electrolyte abnormalities:
Hyponatraemia is usually present but does not reflect a deficiency in
total body Na+; avoid giving too much Na+ in oral or IV fluids.
Hypokalaemia is common, especially in children with diarrhoea, and
contributes to cardiac arrhythmias. Hypomagnesaemia
may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle twitching.
Phosphate levels are often low. K+ and Mg++ should be added to feeds (
p 647). Children with severe malnutrition and diarrhoea need less
sodium and more potassium than well nourished children. Use ReSoMal
rather than standard oral rehydration solution (
p 248-251): give 5
mls/kg PO/NG every 30 mins for the first 2 h; aim to give 70-100 ml/kg
over 12 h. Watch carefully for signs of fluid overload. Once rehydrated,

replace volumes lost in stool. Reserve IV fluids for children in shock (
p 256).

6) Bacterial sepsis:
is a common cause of death in severely malnourished children,
particularly in the early stages of inpatient treatment. Polymicrobial
infections are common and signs of infection such as fever and
inflammation may be absent. All children with SAM should receive
broad-spectrum antibiotics, even if there are no clinical signs of
infection.
Give amoxicillin 500 mg PO tds for 5 days (250 mg tds for children
<10 yrs; 20-40 mg/kg daily in divided doses for children <40 kg; up to
15 mg/kg bd for infants <3 months) or chloramphenicol 25 mg/kg
IM/IV tds for 5 days.
If clinical signs of infection and child does not respond to above
antibiotic regimen within 48 h, either add gentamicin 7.5 mg/kg
IM/IV daily, or change to ceftriaxone (20-50 mg/kg daily by deep IM
injection or by IV injection over 2-4 minutes).

Measles:
Vaccinate all children aged 9 m-15 y against measles, unless proof of
previous vaccination. Children immunized <9 m of age should be revaccinated as their previous immune response may be inadequate.

Malaria:
Do blood film or rapid diagnostic test for malaria on admission and
treat as necessary.

Intestinal helminths:
Treat all patients with albendazole (400 mg once for children less than
2 years).

TB:

Severely malnourished children are at ↑ risk of TB, but diagnosis is
difficult as clinical features are non-specific and a definitive
microbiological diagnosis is only possible in a minority of cases. Search
for TB e.g. by aspiration of cervical glands or gastric washings.
Consider the TB in children who do not respond quickly to standard
nutritional and medical treatment, and in those with a history of
household TB contact (see
p 158).

Micronutrient deficiencies:
are common, although classical clinical signs are often absent. Treat
empirically: give oral vit A on admission (children <6 m 50,000 iu; 6-12
m 100,000 iu; >1 y 200,000 iu), and give the following daily for at least
2 weeks:
a multivitamin supplement.
folic acid (5 mg day 1, then 1 mg/day).
only once gaining weight, give ferrous sulphate 3 mg/kg/day.
zinc (2 mg/kg/day)*.
copper (0.3 mg/kg/day)*.

HIV/AIDS and malnutrition
Among severely malnourished children in sub-Saharan Africa, the
prevalence of HIV is up to 15% in community treatment programmes,
and up to 60% among those in paediatric wards where many are
seriously ill with medical complications. Most severely malnourished
HIV +ve children have low CD4 counts and need anti-retroviral
treatment (ART). CD4 counts are not low in severely malnourished
children without HIV.
Consider testing for HIV in any severely malnourished child. Testing
might arouse fear and stigma because a positive test in the child
reveals the mother is also HIV +ve (often previously unknown). The
benefits of making the diagnosis include appropriate treatment of OIs,
co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, and ART.

Specific issues in HIV +ve children include:
Poor dietary intake due to weakness, painful oral lesions (e.g
candida), anorexia due to fever/infections, and sickness of a parent
or guardian (often also HIV+) → limited care and food provision.
Malabsorption and chronic diarrhoea due to intestinal parasites (e.g.
Cryptosporidium ) cause nutrient losses from the intestine.
Increased energy expenditure due to intercurrent infections.
Severe weight loss and growth faltering, esp. stunting, are common.
Micronutrient deficiencies (incl. vit A, Zn) are common.
Anaemia is common in HIV +ve children, usually the result of chronic
inflammation rather than micronutrient deficiency. Iron supplements
may be harmful in HIV due to the increase in oxidative stress and
HIV viral load.

Management
Give the same nutritional therapy to HIV +ve as to HIV -ve children,
but anticipate more dietary refusal due to infection. Ensure
nutrition during OIs.
Ensure best possible food and drinking water hygiene.
Manage diarrhoea energetically. Give Zn supplements — see
and 646.
Treat infections and OIs vigorously (

p 640

p 83-103).

Give co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.
Refer to an ART clinic; measure CD4 count if resources allow.
Prevent mother-to-child transmission — see

p 132.

Provide health care for the mother and/or carer, including HIV
testing ± CD4 count to assess need for ART. A healthy mother/carer
is crucial to the child's recovery.

Outcome:
HIV greatly affects mortality in severe malnutrition. With adequate
nutritional rehabilitation, the mortality among HIV -ve children should
be <10%, but unless treated with ART, the mortality among HIV +ve
children may be >30% despite all the above interventions.

Nutrition in people with HIV/AIDS
Good nutrition is essential for successful HIV/AIDS management, in
order to maintain immune competence and strength and minimize
the nutritional impact of infections. HIV/AIDS patients (even when
asymptomatic) need an increased food intake:
At least the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vits A, B, C, E,
and minerals (e.g. selenium, folic acid, Zn).
More during recovery from an infection.
Nutritional education should start once a person is identified as HIV
+ve. Focus on how to meet increased dietary needs and prevent OIs
and improve hygiene. Support the entire family, including food
security, hygiene, and psycho-social care of the HIV +ve patient.

To optimize intake:
eat small, frequent meals; make food softer. Include body-building
food (legumes, cereal, animal products), protective foods (fruits and
vegetables, fortified food), and energy foods (sugar, starch and fat,
staple foods).

Problems
Nausea and vomiting: eat frequent small meals and avoid fatty
food.
Mouth sores: avoid hot and spicy foods; eat soft; mashed, liquid
food.
Anorexia: eat frequent small meals. Time ART to minimize impact
of GI side-effects (e.g. nausea) on meals.

Severe malnutrition in infants

Feeding problems, including sickness or absence of the mother,
insufficient breast milk (stress, war, drought), and inappropriate
alternative infant feeding (unsafe bottle feeding), may cause
malnutrition and illness in young infants. Diagnosis of severe
malnutrition in young infants (who are <6 months old or <65 cm in
length) is based on:
W/H <70% (or -3 z scores) and either
Weight loss or growth stagnation (for 1-2 weeks) or
Poor clinical status (illness, apathy, etc.)

Breast feeding
Breastfeeding increases immunity, is hygienic, clean, and cheap, and
there is usually a good supply, though mothers need support. Artificial
feeding in circumstance of poverty carries risks of contamination
(teats, bottles, milk left standing too long, unclean water) and dilution
(no money to buy more milk, sharing with siblings). This can result in
malnutrition through inadequate intake of artificial milk and repeated
episodes of diarrhoea.
In times of insecurity, anxiety, and migration, breast milk might be
reduced. Mothers often think they produce less breast milk because
they are themselves malnourished. In practice, milk quantity is usually
only reduced once maternal energy intake is <1600 kCal/day. Breast
milk quality (especially of micronutrients) is quickly affected by the
mother's diet. A mother's complaint that she does not have enough
milk should be properly investigated. When the milk production is
reported to be reduced or stopped, breastfeeding should be
encouraged and the mother supported with nutritious food. Only if
there is no other option should artificial feeding be used and then the
mother (or caretaker) must be trained in using the milk safely.

Three-phase nutritional treatment
Initial phase (1-15 days): supplement breast milk with specially
diluted therapeutic milk (SDTM); total caloric intake (breast milk
plus SDTM) should be 105 kCal/kg/day (140 ml/kg/day SDTM).

Transition phase (2 days): when breast milk output increases after 10
to 15 days, SDTM can gradually be reduced to half the amount for 2
days (52 kCal/kg/day = 70 ml/kg/day SDTM), and then stopped
completely.
Rehabilitation phase (≥4 days): exclusive breastfeeding under close
supervision.

Treatment for non-breastfed infants
Increase SDTM from 105 to 120 kCal/kg/day. Once infant has gained
weight for 3 consecutive days in the initial phase, gradually replace
SDTM with ‘normal’ breast milk substitutes. Ensure calorie intake
gradually increases from 120 kCal/kg/day (normal intake) to 150
kCal/kg/day for extra growth.

Monitoring
Monitor weight gain on a daily basis. A special scale (10 g precision) is
necessary. If an infant loses weight for 3 consecutive days, either the
amount of food offered is not enough (breast milk plus therapeutic
milk) or underlying medical or social problems must be addressed. Be
alert for infections, including neonatal tetanus, which may cause poor
suckling.

Medical treatment
Severely malnourished young infants require similar medical treatment
regimes to older infants and children with severe malnutrition:
Antibiotics — amoxicillin for at least 5 days (250 mg tds for children
under 10 yrs; 20-40 mg/kg daily in divided doses for children <40 kg;
up to 15 mg/kg bd for infants <3 months).
Vit A (children <6 m 50,000 iu; 6-12 m 100,000 iu; >1 y 200,000 iu);
mothers should receive 200,000 iu at or within 6 weeks of delivery.
Folic acid 5 mg on admission followed by 1 mg daily.
Ensure that the mother has her illnesses diagnosed and treated.

Maternal depression affects infant feeding and growth.

Discharge
The following conditions should be met before discharge:
Clinically well; no infections.
Weight gain of ≥ 100-125 g/week without therapeutic milk
supplementation for 7 days (min 5 g/kg/day, target 10 g/kg/day).
Breastfed infants: active suckling; established breast milk
production.
Non-breastfed infants: supply of breast milk substitutes must be
ensured and the caretaker should understand hygienic preparation
and the dangers of artificial feeding.

Complications of severe malnutrition in infants
Hypothermia: is a major cause of mortality in
malnourished infants. Keep infants warm: skin-toskin contact (kangaroo position); provide blankets
and caps.
Dehydration: use Re-So-Mal.
Malaria: test on admission and as clinically
indicated. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar®)
should not be given to children <2 m old.
Anaemia: iron is given as treatment for anaemia
not as routine therapy. Give 2 mg/kg tds
(preferably as a syrup e.g. Galfer or Fersamal) for
>3 months, but only start after 14 days of
nutritional treatment. When Hb is <5 g/dl, consider
blood transfusion after careful evaluation.
Candidiasis: is frequent in newborns — treat with
nystatin.

Recipes and formulas for management of ill and
severely malnourished children
Concentrated electrolyte/mineral solution (EMS)
This is used in the preparation of starter (F-75) and catch up (F-100)
feeding formula and ReSoMal (low Na+ oral rehydration solution [ORS],
see
p 250). Sachets containing these formulae are manufactured
but if not available, prepare by disolving the following ingredients in
cool, boiled water made up to 2500 ml solution. Store in sterilized
bottles in the fridge to retard deterioration. Discard if turns cloudy and
make fresh each month.
If possible, add selenium (28 mg of sodium selenate, NaSe04.10H20) and
iodine (0.012 g of potassium iodide, KI) per 2500 ml.

Nutritional rehabilitation formulas F-75 and F100
F-75 formula should be used for initial refeeding. Its low osmolality and
low Na+, energy, and protein load minimize the risk of severe
metabolic disturbance during refeeding. Once appetite returns,
oedema clears and medical complications are treated, F-75 is replaced
by F-100 formula, which is higher in energy and protein to facilitate
catch up growth. Ready made sachets of F-75 and F-100 are
increasingly available but where these are not, they can be prepared
using the following ingredients by mixing the milk, sugar, oil, and
electrolyte mineral solution (EMS, see above) into a paste, and then
slowly adding warm, boiled water to make up to 1000 ml. If available,
use an electric blender or hand whisk.
Commercial packets of F-75 starter formula have an even lower
osmolality because maltodextrins replace sugar.

Alternative milk ingredients
If only whole dried milk (WDM) available, an alternative to F-75 may

be prepared using 35 g WDM, 100 g sugar, 20 g oil, 20 ml EMS, and
water up to 1000 ml. Similarly, to prepare an alternative to F-100,
use 110 g WDM, 50 g sugar, 30 g oil, 20 ml EMS, and water up to 1000
ml.
If only fresh cow's milk available, another alternative to F-75 may be
prepared using 300 ml milk, 100 g sugar, 20 g oil, 20 ml EMS, and
water up to 1000 ml. Similarly, to prepare an alternative to F-100,
use 880 ml milk, 75 g sugar, 20 mg oil, 20 ml EMS, and water up to
1000 ml.

Specially diluted therapeutic milk (SDTM)
This is a 75% dilution of F-100 used for severely malnourished infants
(see
p 644). It is made by adding 350 ml water to 1 litre F-100
(Alternatively, mix 50 g dried skimmed milk, 75 g sugar, 25 g oil, and
850 ml of clean water.) It supplies 75 kCal/100 ml, 10 kCal % protein, 50
kCal % fat, and is isotonic with a medium Na+ concentration.

Vit A deficiency
In developing countries, >80% vit A is derived from dietary carotenoids
found in breast milk, dark green vegetables, and yellow and orange
fruits. Margarine and meat (especially liver) are also sources. Vit A
deficiency → ↑ morbidity and mortality among children and is a
preventable cause of blindness from xerophthalmia.
Xerophthalmia is classified as follows:

Night blindness (XN): individual bumps into objects in poor lighting.
Conjunctival xerosis (X1a): dry conjunctiva has glazed appearance.
Bitot's spots (X1b): white foamy spots on conjunctival surface,
commonly at the corneoscleral junction on the temporal side.
Corneal xerosis (X2): dry cornea, associated with the onset of visual
impairment. Most common in children aged 2-4 yrs.
Corneal ulceration (X3a): often worse in measles; central corneal
ulceration may profoundly affect vision.
Keratomalacia (X3b): severe destruction of the eye with blindness;
occurs especially in severe malnutrition precipitated by measles.
Corneal scarring (XS): follows healing after vit A replacement, often
with permanent visual impairment.

Treatment:
For xerophthalmia, severe malnutrition, measles, and
pneumonia/diarrhoea in HIV-infected children:
Give 3 doses of oral vit A at day 1, day 2, and in week 3.
For xerophthalmia, also give topical antibiotic eye ointment (e.g.
tetracycline 1% or chloramphenicol 1%) for 10 days.
If cornea is involved, close the eye and gently cover with an eye
pad.

Pregnancy:
Vit A is teratogenic; high doses are contraindicated. A pregnant woman
with xerophthalmia should receive vit A 5,000-10,000 IU PO od for ≥4
weeks. Vit A supplements should not be given to HIV +ve pregnant
women as they increase perinatal HIV transmission.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of Vit A deficiency
Increase dietary vit A: carotenoids found in breast
milk, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos,
papaya, milk, eggs, red palm oil, liver, fish liver oils.
Prophylactic supplementation (200,000 iu) given 23 times a year to children aged 6 months-5 years
in endemic deficiency areas.

Vit B1 (thiamine) deficiency: beriberi
Thiamine is widely available but deficiency may occur when cereals
such as rice are highly milled. Deficiency may also complicate
alcoholism and nitrofurazone therapy for trypanosomiasis.

Clinical syndromes
Dry beriberi: peripheral sensory and motor neuropathy: gradual
onset of distal limb weakness and wasting with ‘glove and stocking’
sensory loss; foot drop and calf wasting common. Affected muscles
may show oedema and painful contraction when hit. Reflexes and
joint position sense are ↓ or lost; ataxia ± incontinence may develop
in the later stages. Death occurs due to generalized and
diaphragmatic paralysis.
Wet beriberi: high-output cardiac failure. In typical wet beriberi,
peripheries are warm with a bounding pulse, due to peripheral
vasodilation In acute, fulminant beriberi, peripheries are cold due to
poor cardiac output, but death occurs due to CCF.

Infantile beriberi: occurs in infants breastfed from a vit B1-deficient
mother and is an important cause of infant mortality in parts of
Asia. Irritability and oedema typically occur aged 2-3 months and
may be confused with kwashiorkor; progressive heart failure occurs
(± convulsions due to CNS involvement) and death is due to
cardiorespiratory collapse.
Wernicke's encephalopathy classically complicates thiamine
deficiency in chronic alcohol abuse, but may also be precipitated by
infections or by administration of carbohydrate (including IV
dextrose) before thiamine replacement. Clinical features are
confusion, ataxia, nystagmus, and ophthalmoplegia due to
haemorrhagic degeneration in the midbrain and mamillary bodies.
Korsakoff's psychosis may also occur in which there is profound loss
of short term memory — this is reversible with thiamine
replacement, unlike the other clinical features.

Diagnosis
is usually clinical. CXR shows cardiolmegaly and pulmonary oedema in
cardiac beriberi. Plasma pyruvate and lactate are ↑, red cell
transketolase levels are low. Thiamine deficiency may be confirmed in
vitro by ↑ activation of red cell transketolase after addition of
thiamine.

Management:
Acute fulminant beriberi: Thiamine 50-100 mg IV tds, followed by 1025 mg/day PO.
Chronic beriberi: Thiamine 10-25 mg/day PO for ≥6 weeks. Pain in
limbs is relieved rapidly; peripheral neuropathy may take months to
years to resolve.
Infantile beriberi: Thiamine 25-50 mg given IV slowly followed by 10
mg IM daily for 1 week; then 3-5 mg/day orally for 6 weeks. Treat
mother with thiamine 10 mg/day PO for 7 days, then 3-5 mg/day for
6 weeks.

Vit B2 (riboflavin) deficiency

P.652

Riboflavin is found in meat, vegetables, milk, and wholemeal flour.
Overt deficiency is uncommon. Some drugs e.g. phenothiazines and
tricyclic antidepressants interact with riboflavin.

Clinical features:
Angular cheilosis/stomatitis, sore red lips, atrophic glossitis. There
may be plugging of sebaceous glands, giving a roughened appearance
to the skin, and scrotal dermatitis. Anaemia occurs because riboflavin
deficiency → poor iron absorption.

Management:
Riboflavin up to 30 mg PO od. Usually rapidly cured.

Vit B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency
Clinical signs of deficiency are rare, except as peripheral neuropathy
during isoniazid therapy, and pyridoxine antagonists e.g. pyrazinamide
and cycloserine may precipitate sideroblastic anaemia. Dietary sources
include meat and plant foods.

Management:
Pyridoxine 50-200 mg/day PO are widely used, but little evidence for
efficacy. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be partially effective in
idiopathic and hereditary sideroblastic anaemia. Give pyridoxine 10
mg/day during isoniazid therapy and to malnourished alcoholics.

Toxicity:
Peripheral neuropathy is reported following prolonged high-dose
pyridoxine. Improvement is limited even after stopping treatment.

Niacin deficiency: pellagra
Niacin and its precursor tryptophan are found in meat, fish, nuts,

fruits, and vegetables are good sources of preformed niacin. Deficiency
causes pellagra, and is common in communities where maize or
sorghum are the staple, as bioavailability of niacin in maize is low, and
high leucine levels in sorghum impair nicotinic acid and tryptophan
metabolism; deficiency may be mitigated by sufficient dietary
tryptophan e.g. in beans. Pellagra also occurs in malabsorption,
isoniazid therapy alcoholism, and may contribute to diarrhoea,
depression and skin disorders in HIV/AIDS.

Clinical features:
The classical triad is of dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia.
Skin: a photosensitive, sunburn-like rash at sun-exposed sites; there
may be a collar-like ring around the neck (Casal's necklace). Lesions
are sensitive/inflamed, later becoming scaly and desquamates.
Atrophic patches of skin remain between the fingers; the nails
become brittle and atrophic.
Gastrointestinal: gingival swelling ± bleeding; raw, fissured tongue;
dysphagia; villous atrophy and malabsorption; diarrhoea and nausea.
Neurological: insomnia, anxiety, depression, memory loss,
photophobia; mania or psychosis (which may be permanent);
pyramidal and extra-pyramidal signs; frontal reflexes. Confusion can
precede death. Peripheral and cranial neuropathies also occur.
Eyes: conjunctival oedema, corneal dystrophy, and lens opacities
extending from the periphery to the centre.

Management:
Nicotinamide 500 mg daily until complete recovery (at least 3-4
weeks).

Prevention:
In confirmed outbreaks, consider vit B complex supplements for the
entire population as a short-term measure: give nicotinamide 15
mg/person/day.

Vit B12 deficiency
Vit B12 is available in animal products including liver, fish, meat, eggs,
and dairy products, but not in vegetables. Absorption depends on
intrinsic factor from the stomach binding vit B12 to facilitate uptake in
the terminal ileum. Deficiency may be due to poor dietary intake (e.g.
vegans), atrophic gastritis (pernicious anaemia), previous gastrectomy,
and terminal ileal disease. Infection with Diphyllobothrium latum (fish
tapeworm) has been implicated in Russia.

Clinical features
General: Angular cheilosis, glossitis; hyperpigmentation of the hands
and feet is noted in some populations.
Macrocytic anaemia: see

p 464.

Subacute combined degeration of the cord: Dorsal column and
corticospinal tract degeneration → sensory and both upper and
lower motor neuron signs, classically with extensor plantars but
absent knee and ankle reflexes, ± ataxia due to ↓ proprioception;
pain and temperature sensation are preserved as spinothalamic
tracts are not involved. May be precipitated by administration of
high doses of folate to patients with combined B12 and folate
deficiency.
Other neurological sequelae: peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy,
dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, neurodevelopmental delay.

Diagnosis:
Low serum B12; macrocytosis; anaemia; low WBC and platelets (
464). Tests for pernicious anaemia: parietal cell/intrinsic factor
Antibodies, Schilling test.

Management:
Hydroxycobalamin 1 mg IM 3x/week for 2 weeks to replenish body
stores, then 1 mg IM every 3 months (often needed for life); if

p

neurological involvement, give 1 mg on alternate days until no further
improvement, then 1 mg every 2 months.

Folate deficiency
Folate is heat labile and water soluble so is lost in prolonged cooking
or boiling. Deficiency occurs in malabsorption, in pregnancy or
haemolysis, and in patients on anti-folate drugs e.g. methotrexate or
trimethoprim.

Clinical features:
Blood changes are similar to vit B12 deficiency (
p 464) but without
the neurological sequelae. Deficiency in pregnancy ↑ risk of neural
tube defects; intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery, low
birth weight.

Diagnosis:
↓ RBC folate; macrocytic anaemia (

p 464).

Management:
Folic acid 5 mg PO od. Folic Acid is increasingly being added to flour as
part of national government policies.

Vit C deficiency: scurvy
Vit C (ascorbic acid) is essential to collagen formation, promotes iron
absorption, maintains healthy epithelial tissues, particularly of the
mouth and skin, and promotes wound healing. It is found in fresh citrus
fruit and potatoes but is easily destroyed by overcooking. Deficiency
occurs in areas where fruit and vegetables are scarce, in the elderly,
and in young children (who have ↑ requirements).

Clinical features:
General: weight loss, stiffness, weakness, swollen painful large

joints.
Skin: dry skin, hyperkeratosis of hair follicles, ‘corkscrew hairs’,
bruising, perifolicular petechial haemorrhages, poor wound healing.
Mouth: gingivitis, bleeding gums, dental caries, loss of teeth.
Anaemia: microcytic anaemia due to iron deficiency, and/or
megaloblastic anaemia as vit C is required for folate metabolism.

Treatment:
Oral ascorbic acid, in divided doses per day for 2 weeks (Infants <1 m
50 mg/day; 1 m-4 y 125-250 mg/day, 4-12 y 250-500 mg/day, adults 500
mg/day).

Prevention:
Avoid overcooking vegetables; eat citrus fruit, guavas. If necessary,
supplement with tablets (children and adults 25-75 mg/day). Avoid
artificial feeds without fortified vit C.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Scurvy in infants
Infantile scurvy typically presents at 6-12 months in
premature or artificially fed infants. Erupting teeth
cause bleeding of the gums. Subperiosteal
haemorrhages cause limb pain and swelling,
particularly in the long bones — most often palpable
at the distal femur and proximal tibia; costochondral
beading may also be palpable (scorbutic rosary).
Occa-sionally, there is bloody diarrhoea. There may
be a microcytic and/or megaloblastic anaemia. Plain
X-rays of the long bones show epiphyseal changes
and ground glass appearance of the shafts.
P.656

Vit D deficiency: rickets and osteomalacia
Vit D regulates calcium homeostasis by controlling intestinal
absorption and renal excretion of Ca++, and mobilizing Ca++ from bone.
Vit D, also important in cell signalling, gene expression, platelet
aggregation, and host immunity (esp. to TB). The best source of vit D is
oily fish. Vit D3 is rapidly formed in the skin by the action of UV light.
Deficiency may occur due to dietary insufficiency, malabsorption, lack
of UV exposure, liver disease, renal failure, or anticonvulsant therapy
(↑ Vit D metabolism 2° to enzyme induction). It causes rickets in
children and osteomalacia in adults.

Clinical features
Rickets is due to disordered bone mineralization at the growth
plates of growing children, usually <2 years old. Features: irritability,
hypotonia, painful wrists, and tender legs (which may be bowed once
the child starts standing); swollen costo-chondral junctions (‘rachitic
rosary’), pigeon chest, indrawing of the lower ribs (Harrison sulcus),
spinal deformities, bossing of the skull and craniotabes.
Hypocalcaemia may → tetany and laryngeal spasm.
Neurodevelopmental delay also occurs. Overt signs unusual in severe
malnutrition, probably due to ↓ growth.
Osteomalacia occurs in adults, often in women or in the elderly. It
presents with acheing muscles and bones (pelvis, ribs, femora),
pathological fractures, proximal myopathy (waddling gait).
Vit D deficiency is also associated with susceptibility to infection
including TB.

Diagnosis
Is clinical, aided by the following investigations:
X-rays: Cupping and fraying of the metaphyses with widening of the
epiphyses in rickets; osteopenia, Looser's zones (partial fractures
without bony displacement e.g. of lateral scapular border, femur, or
pelvis), biconcave deformity of the vertebrae.

Bloods: low plasma 25-hydroxy vit D. Only in severe deficiency is
there ↓ serum Ca++, ↓PO4-, ↑ ALP.
Bone scanning shows characteristic changes.

Management:
Oral ergocalciferol (vit D2): the daily intake for adults is 400-800 units,
but deficiency should be corrected with a few days of high dose
replacement: adults 40,000 units (1 mg), children <6 m 3,000 units; 6
m-12 y 6,000 units; 12-18 y 10,000 units daily. A single IM dose of
150,000 iu of vit D2 in oil will protect for at least 6 months. Unless
there is plenty of calcium in the diet or water, give calcium 500 mg PO
od for the first 15 days of treatment. Specialist regimens are required
if vit D deficiency due to renal disease or malabsorption.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Calcium deficiency and rickets
Rickets may also occur as a result of calcium
deficiency in the absence of vit D deficiency, e.g. in
African children fed a maize diet low in calcium.
Clinical presentation is similar, but onset is usually
later and hypo-tonia and bone pain tend not to be
features.

Vit E deficiency
Vit E deficiency develops in patients with fat malabsorption (e.g.
cholestatic liver disease) and in patients with congenital
abetalipoproteinaemia who are unable to synthesis VLDL. Premature
infants often have inadequate vit E stores → haemolytic anaemia.

Clinical features:
Haemolytic anaemia, ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy.

Diagnosis:
Plasma vit E (alpha-tocopherol) level.

Treatment:
Few patients need treatment. Treat deficiency with Vit E in premature
neonates (10 mg/kg PO od, or 20 mg/kg IM stat for neonates <1.5 kg),
and children with severe fat malabsorption or abetalipoproteinaemia
(100 mg/kg PO od).

Vit K deficiency
Vit K is essential for production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X,
proteins C and S, and for bone growth. It is found in leafy green
vegetables and is produced by intestinal bacteria. Deficiency occurs in
poorly fed neonates and adults with malabsorption, and results in a
bleeding tendency with ↑ prothrombin time. Neonates have low body
stores, particularly those born prematurely, and deficiency causes
‘haemorrhagic disease of the newborn’.

Treatment:
Vit K (up to 10 mg PO/IV stat) in cases of haemorrhage. Dietary advice
suffices in most non-bleeding cases. Haemorrhagic disease of the
newborn is prevented by giving Vit K 1 mg IM stat to all newborns.

Iodine deficiency
Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis and brain
development and function. Deficiency is usually due to low levels in
soil and water, and most commonly occurs in mountainous areas (e.g.
Nepal and Bolivia) and low-lying areas where flooding has washed
iodine out of the soil (e.g. Bangladesh). Limited iodine availability can
be worsened by eating brassicas, cassava, or soya beans. Deficiency
causes goitre ± hypothyroidism; it is also the most common cause of
preventable mental retardation (‘cretinism’) worldwide.

Clinical features
Goitre: ↑ thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary →
thyroid enlargement. Large goitres may cause dysphagia and
hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve compression). Patients may be
euthyroid (most commonly) or hypothyroid. Not associated with ↑
risk of malignancy.
Endemic (neurologic) cretinism: mental retardation, speech and
hearing deficits, strabismus, spastic diplegia, and a characteristic
apathetic facies with thickened features, May occur as a result of
maternal hypothyroidism in any population, even in the absence of
iodine deficiency.
Hypothyroidism: clinical features are described on
p 514. Severe
hypothyroidism may → ‘myxoedematous cretinism’, characterized
by short stature, ataxia, and mental retardation without hearing
deficit.

Diagnosis
Is clinical, supported by ↑ TSH ± ↓T4; urinary iodine measures of
dietary iodine intake.

Treatment
Iodized oil as a single dose repeated after 1-2 years (see box
opposite).
Lugol's iodine (often kept for sterilization) may also be given as 1
drop every 30 days, or 1 daily teaspoon of a solution containing 1
drop of Lugol's iodine in 30 ml of water.
Surgery may be required for massive goitre.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of iodine deficiency
Visible goitre in >10% of the population indicates

severe iodine deficiency and mass prevention should
be undertaken with IM injections of iodized oil or oral
iodine. Iodine should also be given to pregnant
women in endemic areas to prevent cretinism due to
congenital hypothyroidism.
Iodized salt: Satisfactory iodization of salt can be
tested using simple colour change kits based on
starch/iodine interaction colours.
Iodized poppy seed oil (IPSO) can be used in
endemic areas where salt is not iodized: women
should take IPSO 400 mg as a single dose,
preferably before conception; children should
receive 100 mg if <12 months, 200 mg between 15 years, and 400 mg between 5-18 years. In areas
where intestinal parasites are endemic, give
albendazole to ensure absorption. The dose lasts
for up to two years.
Over-replacement in endemic areas may →
thyrotoxicosis.

Other micronutrients
Zinc
Zinc has antioxidant properties and is essential to several proteins and
enzymes, including those regulating gene expression. Body stores are
minimal so deficiency occurs quickly, especially in catabolic states or if
intestinal losses are high. Zn is found in meat and fish; bioavailability
from cereals is often poor because phytate binds Zn. Deficiency occurs
in severe malnutrition (especially oedematous malnutrition) and low
birth weight infants.

Clinical features:

Failure to thrive, recurrent infections, persistent diarrhoea, scaly
leasions (probably due to local candida) on the feet and buttocks,
stunting, developmental delay. The classical rash of acrodermatitis
enteropathica occurs rarely, usually due to a congenital disorder of Zn
malabsorption. Plasma Zn is often ↓in individuals but single
measurements are unreliable as they ↓ in acute infection.

Treatment:
Zinc 10 mg/day reduces the frequency/severity of respiratory
infections and diarrhoeal disease, including in HIV +ves, and improves
wound healing. A 2-week course of zinc given for diarrhoea reduces
mortality in the following 6 months.

Selenium
Several enzymatic processes require selenium. Dietary sources include
cereals, meat, and nuts. Deficiency occurs where cereals are grown in
low selenium soils → impaired antioxidant activity. This may
contribute to coronary artery disease in some countries (e.g. Finland).
Selenium stimulates immunity and has been advised in nutritional
support for HIV.

Clinical features:
selenium deficiency → cardiomyopathy in China where soils are
deficient in selenium.

Treatment & prevention:
selenium should be included in the electrolyte/mineral mix for
treatment of severe malnutrition. Fertilizers help mitigate the effect
of low selenium levels in the soil.

Copper
Copper is important for several enzymes with antioxidant properties
and for development of collagen. It is widely available in shellfish,
liver, kidney, nuts, and wholegrain cereals. Deficiency is uncommon

and causes osteoporosis and leukopenia with ↑ risk of infection. Copper
deficiency may be precipitated by high Zn doses → impaired copper
absorption; Menke's disease is a rare cause due to defective copper
metabolism. Dietary excess (± genetic predisposition) is implicated in
Indian childhood cirrhosis (
p 303).

Treatment:
Copper should be included in the electrolyte/mineral mix for
treatment of severe malnutrition.

Fluoride
Fluoride is essential for mineralization of bones and teeth, and is
present in the majority of foods and drinking water. Deficiency
contributes to
dental caries. Excess dietary fluoride may occur where the drinking
water is very high in fluoride (e.g. Rift Valley in E Africa, the Punjab)
causing clinical fluorosis.

Clinical features
of deficiency include dental caries and softening of long bones with
deformity. Conversely, fluorosis is characterized by excess fluoride
deposition in teeth and bones, with chalky discolouration of teeth
enamel, spinal rigidity, restricted joint movement, ectopic
mineralization of tendons, ligaments, and occasionally muscles, ↑ bone
density.

Prevention:
Add fluoride to drinking water at source where fluoride levels low.
Where fluorosis is endemic and fluoride levels in water are high,
advise on alternative drinking water sources.

Iron
Iron deficiency is a common cause of anaemia (see

p 460).

Multiple micronutrient supplements
While individual micronutrients have considerable impact on
cellular immunity, antioxidant capacity and individual organ
function, when several micronutrients are given together they may
impair the absorption and metabolism of others. This is less likely if
micronutrients are given together at one or two RDA doses.
At present, there is insufficient evidence that micronutrient
preparations improve the health of individuals in a community
regardless of their dietary intake, nutritional and disease status.
However, there is evidence supporting multiple micronutrient
combinations in HIV/AIDS and TB. There are insufficient data to
recommend particular multiple micronutrient doses.
Multiple micronutrient preparations (up to 15 micronutrients in
doses recommended by WHO/UNICEF) have been shown to improve
outcome in pregnancy and ↑ birthweight. Benefits have also been
shown in postnatal child growth, morbidity, and survival among
children of HIV-infected mothers who receive supplementation with
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid, and vits B6, B12, C and E
during pregnancy.

Obesity
The terms overweight and obese are interchangeable: a person is too
heavy for their height compared with standard references. People
become obese because they take in more calories in food and drink
than they consume in metabolism and work. There is increasing
evidence for diffrences between individuals in appetite, fat
metabolism, and metabolic responses to a meal. There is a global
epidemic of obesity among children in particular. Changes in patterns
of dietary intake in recent years have been associated with reduction
in physical activity.
Obesity tended in the past to be a disease of the prosperous and
urbanization, but present epidemics of obesity affect the poor who buy
cheaper, high-energy foods. Obesity ↑ risk of coronary heart disease,
stroke, hypertension, type II diabetes, gallstones and other digestive

disorders, back problems, arthritis of the knees and hips, accidents,
fractures, and fatigue.

Diagnosis:
A BMI >25 indicates probable obesity; >30 definite obesity. Children are
obese if they weigh >97th centile on either the W/H or W/A curve
(growth chart
p 630).

Management:
weight loss is difficult:
Eat foods containing more fibre and less fat or sugar. Instead of highenergy snacks, eat fruit or maize cobs. Avoid sweets, chips, crisps,
and cakes; ↓ alcohol.
Exercise for >20 mins per day at a level sufficient to raise the pulse
and respiratory rates.
Be realistic and offer encouragement, not scorn.
Advise stopping smoking to reduce cardiovascular risk.
Avoid drugs which suppress appetite and metabolism — the evidence
for these is lacking.

Differential diagnosis of fevers
Fever is a common presentation of infections (and, less commonly,
inflammatory conditions or malignancy). The fever pattern does not
reliably distinguish bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal, or non-infectious
causes of fever. Distinctive patterns of fever and pulse rate which were
emphasized in the past (e.g. a step-wise increase in fever and relative
bradycardia which were previously thought to be typical of typhoid)
are now seldom emphasized. In fever from whatever cause, body
temperature tends to rise in the late afternoon/evening and falls
during the night. This gives rise to a sensation of being cold in the
afternoon/evening and night sweats. Fever is often intermittent; it
may be absent in the morning and absent if paracetamol, aspirin, or
NSAIDs have been taken. Patients on steroids may have little or no
fever.
A history of drenching sweats or rigors (chills or shivering, often
uncontrollable and lasting for minutes) is always significant. Rigors are
generally indicative of malaria or bacterial sepsis, and occasionally of
severe viral infection (e.g. Dengue, Lassa fever). TB, kala-azar, and
other chronic infections do not generally cause rigors, and nor do mild
viral infections (e.g EBV or respiratory viruses), malignancy, or
connective tissue diseases.
In view of the wide range of possible diagnoses, a detailed history and
complete physical examination are essential. During the assessment,
consider:
Where is the site of infection?
Which are the likely infecting organisms?
Is this presentation unusual? Has it become more common recently?
Might an epidemic be occurring?

Is the patient immunocompromised (or might they be)? If so,
consider the differential diagnoses for both immunocompetent and
immunocompromised individuals.
Serious infections such as meningococcal sepsis and malaria may
have ‘false localizing’ symptoms and signs such as headache,
breathlessness, vomiting, or diarrhoea.
In the presence of localizing features, investigations are targeted
towards the presumed cause. Specimens (blood, urine, CSF, etc.) for
microscopy and culture, if available, are most useful.
Treatment with antibiotics can be started based on a clinical
diagnosis and the likely infecting organisms. Consult local guidelines
for choosing antibiotics — if available.

Common infections with localizing features
•

Pneumonia

Breathlessness, cough, sputum, pleurisy

•

Pulmonary TB

Prolonged cough, haemoptysis

Fever without localizing features

This is a challenging clinical problem. The following are helpful in
determining the likely cause:
Blood smears for microscopy for malaria.
Total and differential white cell counts.
Platelet count.
Blood culture (where available).

The importance of malaria
In many tropical areas, malaria is the most common and important
cause of fever and should be the first diagnosis considered. Patients
generally have evening fevers, so may be afebrile in a morning clinic.
In endemic areas, low-grade parasitaemia without symptoms is
common in adults and older children (due the development of partial
immunity to malaria). Thus, the finding of low-grade parasitaemia (or
a positive rapid diagnostic test [RDT]) in an individual with fever does
not prove that the fever is caused by malaria — always consider
additional diagnoses. Febrile patients with no visible malaria parasites
(or a negative RDT) should not be treated for malaria. It is false to
assume that a patient can be ill, even severely ill, with malaria and
have no malaria parasites detectable. However, blood films and RDTs
may need to be repeated daily to be sure they are negative.

Blood counts in a patient with fever (see box
opposite)
White cell counts and platelet count may give some useful clues to the
cause of fever, although this must be considered in the context of
careful clinical assessment of the patient.

Treatment of fever of unknown cause
Quite commonly, a positive diagnosis cannot be made after the initial
clinical assessment and tests. The management then depends on:
Your judgement of the most likely diagnoses.

How severely ill the patient is.
Available resources.
Patients who you judge to be (or at risk of becoming) seriously unwell
should be given ‘best guess’ empirical antimicrobial therapy, using
local guidelines if they exist.
Admission to hospital, if possible, is the best course if you are worried
about the patient's condition. In time, the diagnosis is likely to become
apparent, particularly if the patient is regularly reassessed.

Persistent fever despite antimicrobial therapy
Antimicrobials chosen do not treat the infecting organism.
Infecting organism is resistant to chosen antimicrobials.
Inadequate drug concentration at site of infection — think about
compliance, dose, absorption, drug penetration into special sites
(e.g. CSF, collections/abscesses).
Non-infectious cause of fever.
Antibiotic-induced (drug) fever.

If total white cell count ↑, look at the differential WBC

Sepsis
The features of sepsis result from the interaction between the
pathogen and host defences. Bacterial infections are the most common
cause, but other serious infections (e.g. falciparum malaria, Lassa
fever) can cause an identical clinical syndrome. Some non-infectious
insults can produce an identical clinical syndrome (e.g. pancreatitis,
chemical toxins, burns).

Definitions of sepsis and related disorders
Sepsis:
Clinical evidence of infection, plus evidence of a systemic response
manifested by 2 or more of:
Temperature >38°C or <36°C.
Heart rate >90 beats/min.
Respiratory rate >20 breaths/min.
WBC >12 or <4, or >10% immature forms.

Severe sepsis:
Sepsis associated with organ dysfunction:
Hypotension.
Lactic acidosis.
Oliguria.
Confusion.

Hepatic dysfunction.

Septic shock:
Severe sepsis with hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

Management
The cornerstones of treatment are:
IV fluid resuscitation.
Antimicrobial therapy — ‘best guess’ empirical treatment should be
started immediately (after blood cultures, if available).
In severely ill patients, a wide range of supportive measures (e.g.
vasopressor therapy, IV hydrocortisone, mechanical ventilation,
haemofiltration) might be indicated if available.
However, despite intensive treatment, mortality from sepsis remains
high — overall, about 20-30% in sepsis, rising to 50% in patients with
severe sepsis or shock, and over 80% in patients with multi-organ
failure.

Pregnancy-related infections

P.672

The risk of maternal death varies from 7/100,000 in Scandinavia to
1000/100,000 in some parts of Africa and Middle East. The major causes
of maternal death are:
Sepsis.
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
Haemorrhage.
Complications of obstructed labour.

General principles of management
Emptying the uterus is essential for a cure — deliver the baby or
evacuate any retained products.

Antibiotics should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made.
A wide range of bacteria may cause these infections and there is
often more than one organism — broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
should be used that includes cover for Streptococci, Gram -ves, and
anaerobes.

Prevention
Are there any simple measures that could be introduced to prevent
some pregnancy-related infections? Consider the major risk factors
listed in the box. The most effective ways to reduce post-abortion
infections are to make available:
Contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Medical abortions.

Cancer
Cancer will become an increasingly important cause of premature
mortality in the developing countries as populations expand and age,
and as tobacco consumption increases and diets are westernized.
Approximately 60% of global cancer occurs in developing countries: ~10
million new cases per year. This is likely to double by 2020; most of the
increase occurring in developing countries. There is wide geographical
variation in the prevalence of some cancers. Lung cancer is the most
common cancer worldwide, followed by stomach, liver, colon and
rectum, oesophagus, and breast. Breast cancer is the most common
fatal cancer in women.
Cancer requires early intervention for therapy to be effective. Bearing
this in mind, basic rules include:
Cancer should be suspected in any unexplained illness, particularly
in the elderly.
An attempt should be made to get a histological or cytological
diagnosis as soon as feasible.
Once diagnosed, patients should start a planned regimen of
treatment within days, not weeks. Tumours grow exponentially and
there is no room for delay.

Signs and symptoms common to many forms of
cancer
Pain: due to direct effect of tumour (e.g. infiltration of nerves or
compression), its treatment, or metastatic spread to the bones. Any
patient with unexplained persistent pain should be suspected of
having malignant disease.
Weight loss: due to involvement of GI tract (obstruction, metastatic
liver involvement), anorexia, or general cachexia due to a catabolic

state. May be exacerbated by treatment.
Tumour mass: often ignored by doctors but requiring early diagnosis
by biopsy, preferably by fine needle aspiration.
Fever: while normally caused by superimposed infection, fever may
itself be a feature of cancers such as lymphomas, renal CA, and
tumours metastasizing to the liver. Frequently occurs as drenching
night sweats without rigors.
Anaemia: normocytic normochromic (sometimes hypochromic) due
to bleeding, malabsorption, or anaemia of chronic disease.
Hypercalcaemia: due to widespread metastases to the skeleton or,
more commonly, to paraneoplastic syndromes.

Paraneoplastic syndromes
These occur relatively commonly and are due to tumour-derived
cytokines or hormones or to a tumour-induced immune response crossreacting with normal tissue. The range includes endocrine,
neurological, dermatological, musculoskeletal, and haematological
syndromes. Paraneoplastic symptoms often improve on therapy. Most
neurological problems are due to metastases, and most endocrine
problems due to endocrine tumours themselves, not paraneoplastic
syndromes.

WHO performance status
This is useful for grading the status of cancer patients and
determining prognosis.
0 Able to carry out normal activity without restriction
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but walking about and
able to carry out light work
2 Walking about and capable of self-care but unable to carry out
any work; up and about >50% of waking hours
3 Capable of self-care; confined to bed or chair >50% of waking
hours
4 Completely disabled; cannot carry out self-care; totally

confined to bed or chair

Important complications of some tumours
Spinal cord/cauda equina compression†.
Cerebral metastases and raised intracranial
pressure†
Carcinomatous meningitis — leads to headache and
increased ICP
Pleural and pericardial effusions.

General rules of cancer management
Whenever you see a patient known to have cancer, think of the
following points:
1. Could the patient have neutropenia? Infection in a neutropenic
patient often presents suddenly with sepsis, but without localizing
features, and cultures are usually negative. Neutropenia commonly
occurs if the patient has had chemotherapy, Normal bacterial flora
from the mouth, digestive tract, respiratory tract, or skin are
usually responsible, and indwelling lines and catheters may be the
source. Any cancer patient who is feeling ‘run down’ must have their
WCC checked immediately and not be sent home. Such patients can
deteriorate quickly and be dead within hours.
2. Could the patient have hypercalcaemia? Unlike 1° parathyroid
disease, the onset is rapid and there are none of the classical
‘stones, bones, or groans’. Instead clinical features include:
polyuria, thirst, confusion, fatigue, coma. Treatment of
hypercalcaemia will produce a marked improvement in the patient's
condition.
3. Is the patient's pain controlled? Use morphine — it is a very effective
drug. The following regimen is useful:

Give morphine 10 mg q4 h at 07.00, 11.00, etc., until 23.00, at
which point give a double dose so that the 03.00 dose can be
missed out, offering the chance of a good night's sleep.
If pain breaks through, give an extra dose of morphine 10 mg
(even if the next q4 h dose is only 10 mins away), continuing the
q4 h dose as normal.
As more breakthrough doses are required, increase the regular q4
h dose (e.g. to 20 mg).
(If using long-acting morphine (e.g. MST 80 mg bd), take total daily
dose (160 mg) and divide by 6 (q4 h doses) to give size of the IV
morphine dose to use for breakthroughs — here 160/6 = ~26 mg).
4. Could the patient have early cord compression? Ask: Can you walk?
When was the last time you walked? Have you been incontinent of
urine and/or faeces? Do a neurological exam including anal tone and
sacral sensation, and check for a palpable bladder. Missing spinal
cord compression may result in the patient spending their last few
weeks or months in a miserable paraplegic state.

Hypercalcaemia
Rehydrate with 0.9% saline IV (e.g. 4-6 L in 24 h depending on
hydration status).
Once rehydrated consider forced saline diuresis: continue 0.9%
saline infusion and give e.g. Furosemide 40 mg bd PO/IV.
Consider single bisphosphanate infusion (e.g pamidronate) to
lower calcium over 2-3 days (max effect at 1 week). Dose varies
according to serum calcium level (see below).
Steroids may help in some conditions e.g. sarcoidosis, malignancy.
If possible treat the underlying cause.

Fig. 18.1 Overview of the management of acute severe pain

Management of acute pain in hospital
1. Effective relief can be achieved with oral non-opioid and NSAIDs.
Ibuprofen 400 mg is very effective and is associated with fewer
gastrointestinal bleeds than some other NSAIDs. Also effective are
paracetamol 1 g and paracetamol combined with codeine.
2. Initial management of moderate pain e.g. in post-surgical

patients, should ideally be an oral NSAID such as ibuprofen,
supplemented if necessary with paracetamol. In the elderly,
paracetamol may be preferred, although it is less effective. There
is no evidence that parenteral is more beneficial than oral
administration.
Opioids are the first-choice treatment for severe acute pain.
Additional, often smaller doses can be given if the patient is still
in pain and you are sure that all the previous dose has been
delivered and absorbed. Repeat doses can be given 5 mins after IV
injection, 1 h after IM or SC injection, and 90 mins after an oral
dose. The route of administration can be changed to achieve
faster control if there is no response to the repeated dose.
Titrate opioids against degree of pain relief. Inadequate pain
control results from too little drug, too long dosing intervals, too
little attention being paid to the patient, or too much reliance on
rigid regimens.
Morphine is the most appropriate opioid and it is popular amongst
pain specialists. Its analgesia lasts a reliable 4 h and is easier to
titrate than opioids with a longer half-life. Set up a q4 h regimen
which prevents the occurrence of pain (see
p 676 for an
example of a q4 h morphine regimen.)
As the pain decreases, the patient can be switched to ibuprofen
and paracetamol. Supplementation of morphine with an NSAID
allows the morphine dose to be reduced.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
RA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition of unknown cause
that primarily involves joints. It is associated with disability,
accelerated atherosclerosis, and increased mortality. Lack of
treatment or poor response to treatment leads to permanent joint
destruction and deformity. Onset is usually between the 3rd and 5th
decade and RA affects women 2-3 times more frequently than men.

Symptoms:

include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.

Clinical signs:
usually chronic symmetrical joint swelling (often PIPs, MCPs, MTPs,
wrists, knees); affects the cervical but not the lumbar spine.
Extra-articular disease: anaemia of chronic disease, subcutaneous
nodules (usually extensor), fatigue, pleuropericarditis,
lymphadenopathy, nerve entrapment (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome),
mononeuritis multiplex, splenomegaly, episcleritis, scleritis, Sjögrens
syndrome, and lung fibrosis.

Diagnosis:
by history and physical examination — there is no definitive test.
X-rays: affected joints may show typical changes (soft tissue swelling,
symmetric joint space narrowing, bone erosions, and deformities).
Immunology: rheumatoid factor is positive in approximately 80% of
patients (false positive in 5% of healthy people, more often in old age,
chronic infections, liver disease, fibrotic lung disease, and other
rheumatic diseases).

Complications:
patients with longstanding RA and poor disease control may develop
irreversible joint damage and deformity, limited functional capacity
and atlanto-axial instability.

Management
Non-pharmacologic: patient education, aerobic and resistance
exercise, physical and occupational therapy.
Pharmacologic: disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs (DMARDs)
are critical to prevent permanent damage. They should be
prescribed as early as possible and are often needed lifelong.
Monitoring for drug toxicity is needed (see box). DMARDs are used
alone or in combination for disease control. Most widely used are

methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and antimalarials — chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine. A common combination is methotrexate +
sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine. Other DMARDs include
leflunomide, cyclosporin, and biologic agents. These biologic agents
include anti-TNF drugs (infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab),
anti-IL-1 (anakinra), anti CD-20 (rituximab), and CTLA4 Ig
(abatacept). All are extremely expensive. Rarely used DMARDs
include: gold salts, penicillamine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide
and azathioprine.
Oral NSAIDs decrease pain and swelling; they only provide
symptomatic relief and do not affect other outcomes, and if used,
should always be used with DMARDs.
Corticosteroids can be used orally in low-doses (equivalent to <10 mg
prednisolone/day) or as intra-articular injections. If steroids are
used, it is almost always with a DMARD.
Surgery for deformity/complications.

Differential diagnosis of RA
Acute viral polyarthritis: caused by hepatitis, rubella.
Parvovirus: self-limited (weeks); history of rash IgM viral
antibodies.
Connective tissue diseases: symmetric polyarthritis without joint
deformities. Look for other multi-systemic features.
Septic arthritis: usually acute monoarthritis. Immediate joint
aspirate (for Gram and ZN stain, crystals, culture) and antibiotics
are required to prevent permanent joint damage.
Fibromyalgia: diffuse pain without inflammation. Insomnia and
fatigue.
Reactive arthritis: asymmetric oligoarthritis, sausage digits. Look
for urethritis, conjunctivitis, and history of enteric infection.
Gout/pseudogout: acute episodic attacks. In gout, monoarthritis
of the 1st MTP is common. Definitive diagnosis made by finding
crystals in synovial fluid.
Osteoarthritis (see below).

Paraneoplastic syndromes.
HIV-associated arthritis (usually reactive arthritis pattern).

Monitoring of drugs commonly used to treat RA
Drug (usual doses)

Monitoring

NSAIDs

FBC ± yearly LFT and creatinine

Methotrexate (7.5-20 mg weekly)

FBC, AST, albumin, creatinine every 4-8 wks

Chloroquine (150 mg [base] daily*)

Fundoscopy and visual fields every 6-12 months

Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily)

Fundoscopy and visual fields every 6-12 months

Sulfasalazine (max 2-3 g daily)

FBC 2-4 weekly for 3 months, then 3 monthly

* Note:

Chloroquine base 150 mg = chloroquine sulphate 200 mg = chloroquine phosphate

250 mg

Contraindications to drugs for RA
NSAIDs: GI bleed, peptic ulcer; if NSAID required combine with a PPI.
Methotrexate: pregnancy, elevated creatinine, alcohol use, liver
disease, abnormal LFTs, HIV, HBV, HCV.
Sulfasalazine: allergy to sulfas, G6PD deficiency.

Osteoarthritis
OA is a chronic, non-inflammatory arthropathy that can be idiopathic
or secondary to trauma or other conditions.

Symptoms:
non-inflammatory joint pain (see box). The knees, hips, and DIPs are
most commonly affected. If unusual joints are involved (elbows,
ankles, MCPs) look for secondary causes: previous trauma,
hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or reconsider diagnosis (could be

RA).

Clinical signs:
bony swelling, crepitus.

Diagnosis:
by history and physical exam.

X-ray findings:
non-uniform joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and juxtaarticular
osteosclerosis.

Management
Non-pharmacologic: patient education (weight loss if obese, exercise
to strengthen muscles around affected joint), physical and
occupational therapy.
Analgesia: paracetamol ± NSAID.
Glucosamine sulphate: 500 mg tid (under evaluation).
Intra-articular hyaluronans.
Intra-articular glucocorticoids.
Surgery including prosthetic joint replacement.

Classification of joint pain
Inflammatory e.g. RA
Improves with activity.
Worse in the morning.
Morning stiffness >60 minutes.
Systemic features: sometimes.
Soft swelling (effusion).
Sometimes erythema.

Sometimes warmth

Non-inflammatory e.g. OA
Exacerbated by activity.
Worse at night.
Morning stiffness <30 minutes.
Systemic features: absent.
Hard swelling (‘bony’).
No erythema.
No warmth.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
A multi-system chronic inflammatory disease characterized by facial
rash, photosensitivity, alopecia, nephritis, serositis, arthritis, CNS
involvement, vasculitis, and fever. A etiology is unknown. Women are
affected 10 times more often than men; peak incidence is between 15
and 40 years of age. Causes of death include infections and disease
activity in early phases of the disease, and atherosclerosis in the longterm.

Clinical features
General: fever, fatigue, weight loss.
Joints: arthralgia/arthritis (may be similar to RA, but usually nonerosive).
Skin: photosensitive rash, purpura, alopecia, livedo reticularis,
mouth ulcers.
Raynaud's phenomenon.
Renal: nephritic or nephrotic syndrome; renal failure.
CNS: depression, psychosis, seizures.
Serositis: pleural and pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary: pneumonitis, fibrosis, bronchiolitis.

Cardiovascular: hypertension, pericarditis, sterile (Libman-Sachs)
endocarditis.
Blood: normocytic anaemia, haemolysis (Coombs positive),
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.
Thrombosis and miscarriage, which may be part of the
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

Laboratory tests:
several auto-antibodies that react with the cell nucleus are a feature
of the disease. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are positive in more than
95% of patients. However, ANA are not specific; patients with other
rheumatic conditions or chronic diseases, and 5% of normal subjects
have positive ANA. Anti-double-stranded DNA and particularly antiSmith (anti-Sm) antibodies are more specific but less sensitive.

Diagnosis:
American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE are given
in the box opposite: 4 or more criteria should be present to make the
diagnosis, but some patients meet fewer than 4 criteria.

Management
Education: sun avoidance, sunscreen, hat, long sleeves.
NSAIDS: useful for musculoskeletal symptoms and serositis.
Antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine): effective for skin
and musculoskeletal symptoms; may prevent renal and CNS flares.
Systemic corticosteroids: prednisolone <0.5 mg/kg for moderate
disease; higher doses (1 mg/kg) for severe or lifethreatening disease,
including renal disease, pneumonitis, severe cytopenias, or CNS
lupus. Consider high-dose IV methylprednisolone boluses for severely
ill patients. Corticosteroids should be tapered early according to
response; combine with steroid sparing agents to minimize steroid
side-effects.

Cyclophosphamide: used to treat severe disease including
proliferative lupus nephritis, vasculitis, CNS involvement, and
alveolar hemorrhage.
Azathioprine: as a steroid-sparing agent.
Mycophenolate mofetil: used to treat lupus nephritis; may be as
effective as cyclophosphamide with less adverse events.
Others: rituximab, chlorambucil, cyclosporin. For refractory skin
involvement: thalidomide.
Anticoagulation for the antiphospholipid syndrome.

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers
These conditions, also called enteric fever, follow infection with
Salmonella spp. (S. typhi → typhoid; S. paratyphi types A, B, C →
paratyphoid). They are endemic and important causes of morbidity
across the developing world. Typhoid is most severe; paratyphoid B
mildest, with types A and C falling somewhere in between. Early
antibiotic treatment is essential to ↓ mortality — start empirically if
clinical suspicion strong. Following 1° multiplication in mesenteric
lymph nodes, bacteria infect cells of the reticuloendothelial system
where multiplication occurs again. This produces a 2° bacteraemia,
infection of multiple organs, and clinical illness. If untreated, 20% die
from overwhelming toxaemia or 2° organ involvement, particularly
encephalopathy, toxic myocarditis, or GI haemorrhage and peritonitis.
Importantly for infection control, chronic asymptomatic gall bladder
infection is common — carriers have highly infectious stools.

Transmission:
via ingestion of food or water contaminated by infected faeces/urine.
Gastric acid is protective so any condition that decreases its
production increases an individual's susceptibility to infection.

Clinical features:
Incubation period is 10-20 days; untreated illness typically lasts ~4
weeks (may be shorter in severe infections and vice versa).
1st week: non-specific features of malaise, headache, rising
remitting fever with mild cough, constipation.
2nd week: patient becomes toxic and apathetic; sustained high
temperature with relative bradycardia; rose spots (2-4 mm pink
papules on central torso, fading on pressure) may transiently occur;
distended abdomen; hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly.

3rd week: increasing toxicity with persistent high temp; the patient
becomes delirious and weak with feeble pulse, tachypnoea ± basal
crepitations, profuse ‘pea soup’ diarrhoea. Look and listen for
abdominal distention and bowel sounds. Neurological complications
may occur (may rarely be the presenting complaint). Death occurs
during week 2, 3, or 4.
4th week: if the patient survives, fever, mental state, and abdominal
distension gradually improve. GI complications occur at any time,
most commonly in weeks 2-4.

Diagnosis:
culture of bone marrow (best), blood, stool, or rectal swab.

Management
Give antibiotics — see box.
Give dexamethasone (3 mg/kg IV stat, then 1 mg/kg q6 h for 2 days)
to patients with shock or ↓ consciousness — it may reduce mortality.
Toxic patients must be observed carefully for signs of GI
haemorrhage (treat conservatively) or peritonitis (treat with
surgery).

Relapse:
up to 20% of treated patients relapse after treatment and initial
recovery. Relapses are generally milder and shorter than 1° illness; 2nd
and 3rd relapses have been reported, therefore follow-up if possible.
Co-infection with schistosomes may result in chronic/recurrent fever
since the bacteria survive within parasites, protected from antibiotics.

Prevention:
improved sanitation, vaccination.

Treatment of typhoid
First-choice antibiotics vary due to local resistance

In Africa and the Americas
Alternatives are:
chloramphenicol 1 g PO qds for 10-14 days.
amoxicillin 500 mg PO tds for 10-14 days.
co-trimoxazole 960 mg PO bd for 10-14 days.

In Asia
Although chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, and co-trimoxazole remain
effective in some areas, in many areas MDR strains (resistant to
chlorampenicol, amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole) and strains with
reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones are common. Alternatives
are:
ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg PO bd for 7-14 days.
ceftriaxone 60 mg/kg IV od for 7-14 days.
azithromycin 500 mg PO od for 7 days (not in severe disease).

In severe disease
Dosages for each drug can be increased 1.5 x initially and given IV.

Rickettsioses (typhus fevers)
Rickettsioses are zoonoses caused by small intracellular bacilli. Ticks,
fleas, or mites act as vectors and/or reservoirs.

Spotted fever group rickettsioses
These are transmitted by the bite of ixodid (hard) ticks. Dogs, rodents,
and other animals are the reservoir. After 3-14 days' incubation fever,
headache, muscle pain, rash, local lymphadenopathy, and an
inoculation eschar (small ulcer with black centre and red areola)
typically develop.
‘Rocky mountain spotted fever’ (Rickettsia rickettsii, USA) is
frequently severe (mortality 13-25% in untreated cases). There is no
eschar.
‘Boutonneuse fever’ or ‘Mediterranean spotted fever’ (Rickettsia

conorii, Africa, India, Europe, and the Middle East) is usually less
severe.
‘African tick bite fever’ (Rickettsia africae, sub-Saharan Africa) is
milder. Multiple eschars and outbreaks in groups of travellers may
occur.
Other forms include ‘Queensland tick typhus’, ‘North Asian Tick
fever’.

Rickettsial pox
Rickettsia akari is transmitted by mites in the Eastern USA and former
Soviet Union. The rash is vesicular and may be confused with
chickenpox.

Epidemic (louse-borne) typhus fever (Rickettsia
prowazekii)
Rickettsia prowazekii is transmitted between humans by the human
body louse in cold, unhygienic conditions, particularly during war and
famine. The disease is endemic in mountainous areas in eastern Africa,
Mexico, Central and South America, and Asia.
Rickettsia are excreted in the faeces of infected lice and inoculated
into the abrasions or the bite wound by scratching.
After 1-2 weeks' incubation there is abrupt onset of fever, headache,
prostration, myalgia, conjunctival injection, rales. There is no
eschar. A macular rash appears on day 5 or 6. Fatality ranges from
10-40% (untreated) and increases with age.
Brill-Zinsser disease is a milder recrudescent disease which may
occur years later in those who have not been adequately treated.

Endemic (flea-borne) typhus fever (Rickettsia
typhi)
This is transmitted from rats to humans by fleas. It is found worldwide
where rats and humans co-exist. Rickettsia are transmitted in flea

faeces during a blood mean. The illness is similar to epidemic typhus
but milder.

Cat flea typhus/flea-borne spotted fever
(Rickettsia felis)
This is a recently recognized illness with a clinical picture similar to
the spotted fever group but is transmitted by the cat flea.

Scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi)
Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of trombiculid mites living in
sharply delimited areas (‘mite islands’) in central, east, and southeast
Asia, and northern Australia.
A punched out eschar develops after 6-21 days followed by a severe
acute febrile illness resembling typhus. Pneumonitis is common.
Case fatality varies widely with infecting strain and increasing age.
Unlike other rickettsial illnesses, repeat infections may occur, since
immunity does not cross-protect against heterologous strains.

Diagnosis and management of rickettsial
infection
Diagnosis
is often clinical in the right epidemiological setting. It can be verified
by serology, PCR, or isolation of rickettsia in cell culture from samples
early in infection.

Management:
Give antibiotics (in severe cases, drugs can be given IV):
Doxycycline 100 mg PO bd or 200 mg od for 7-10 days is standard
therapy for rickettsial infections. In some situations (e.g. louseborne typhus) a single 200 mg dose is sufficient.

Alternative: chloramphenicol 500 mg PO QID for 7-10 days.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Doxycycline is favoured for treatment of moderate to
severe rickettsial infections in children. Milder
infections (e.g. Mediterranean spotted fever) can be
treated with newer macrolides e.g. azithromycin 10
mg/kg/day for 3 days.
PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Lice: apply residual insecticide powder to clothes
and persons in situations favouring infestation; reapply regularly. Provide facilities for bathing and
washing clothes and bedclothes. In epidemic
situations, apply residual insecticide to all contacts
or the entire community.
Ticks: look for and remove attached or crawling
ticks after exposures. De-tick dogs. Use tick
repellants and protective clothing to avoid contact.
Fleas: apply residual insecticides to rat burrows or
harbourages. Wait until flea populations have been
reduced before instituting rodent control measures
(to avoid increased human exposure to fleas).

Ehrlichia, Bartonella, and Coxiella
Bartonella
are intracellular bacteria with tropism for erythrocytes and
endothelial cells.
B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse amongst the
homeless, those living in crowded, unhygienic conditions, and during

war. It causes trench fever, chronic bacteraemia, and endocarditis in
the immunocompetent, and bacillary angiomatosis (BA) in the
immunocompromised.
B. henselae is transmitted amongst cats by the cat flea and to
humans by cat scratch or bite. It causes cat scratch disease
(uncommonly bacteraemia and endocarditis in immunocompetent
persons) as well as bacillary angiomatosis and peliosis hepatis.
B. bacilliformis is transmitted by sandflies in the Andes and causes
Oroya fever (especially in tourists and transient workers) and
verruga peruana (especially amongst natives of the Peruvian Andes).

Human ehrlichioses
are tick-borne zoonoses caused by intracellular bacilli. The organisms
are found in vacuoles within leukocytes where they divide to form a
cluster (morula). Ehrlichia chafeensis infects monocytes whilst E.
ewingii and Anaplasma phagocytophilum infect neutrophils.
Ehrlichia chafeensis and E. ewingii are transmitted from a variety of
vertebrates (particularly deer and dogs) to humans by the
Amblyomma tick in the southern USA.
A. phagocytophilum is transmitted from vertebrates (particularly
ruminants and rodents) to humans by Ixodid ticks in the USA and
Europe.
Coxiella burnetii is an intracellular coccobacillus that causes Q fever.
It infects a wide variety of animals (especially cattle, sheep, and
goats), including ticks. Animals shed C. burnetii in milk, faeces, urine,
and, particularly, birth by-products. Hides and wool may be
contaminated with tick faeces containing concentrated organisms.
Humans acquire infection through inhalation of infected aerosols
(which may be air-borne over considerable distances), ingestion of
unpasteurized dairy products, or contact with contaminated clothing.
Person-to-person spread is rare.

Clinical features

Trench fever presents with acute onset fever (‘5 day fever’),
headache, dizziness and shin pain. Most cases are self-limiting. A
minority develop chronic infection (attacks of fever, chronic
bacteraemia, endocarditis).
Cat scratch disease usually presents as a tender, self-limiting (2-3
months) regional lymphadenopathy without fever. Complications are
rare (retinitis, encephalopathy, visceral forms).
Bacillary angiomatosis and peliosis hepatis are due to vascular
proliferative lesions in the skin or liver but can involve any organ.
They typically occur in immunocompromised (HIV) patients. Skin
lesions are nodules or papules which may be red to purple, ulcerate,
or bleed.
Oroya fever is life-threatening septicaemia with haemolysis. It is
often complicated by bacterial super-infection (especially
Salmonella, other Gram-negatives, and S. aureus). Verruga peruana
presents with benign cutaneous vascular lesions.
Ehrlichiosis presents with an acute flu-like illness which may be
accompanied by rash, vomiting and meningoencephalitis.
Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and raised hepatic transaminase
levels are common. Illness caused by E. chafeensis is generally more
severe, with a 3% fatality rate. E. ewingii generally causes disease in
immunocompromised patients.
Q fever may be asymptomatic or present as an acute flu-like illness
with varying hepatitis and pneumonia. Culture-negative endocarditis
is an important chronic presentation. C. burnetti can recrudesce in
pregnancy causing abortion. There is an association with chronic
fatigue syndrome.

Diagnosis
Serology or PCR.
Examination of peripheral blood films for morulae within neutrophils
or monocytes (ehrlichiosis) or bacilli within or adherent to
erythrocytes (Oroya fever).

For cat scratch disease, large rods can be seen in tissue sections
stained with Warthin-Starry silver stain (but not Gram or ZN stains).

Management
Trench fever: doxycycline 200 mg PO od for 4 weeks plus gentamicin
3 mg/kg IV od for the first 2 weeks.
Cat scratch disease: no therapy unless extensive or complicated:
azithromycin 500 mg PO on day 1 then 250 mg PO on days 2-5.
Bacillary angiomatosis and peliosis hepatis: azithromycin 250 mg PO
od or erythromycin 500 mg PO qds for 2-3 months.
Oroya fever: ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bd for 10 days.
Ehrlichiosis: doxycycline 100 mg BID PO or IV for 7-10 days.
Q fever: doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7-10 days. C. burnetti
endocarditis requires 18 months doxycycline plus
hydroxychloroquine.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Control or avoidance of the vectors: delousing of
clothing and body with powder; preventative
measures against tick bites. Cat scratches and bites
should be thoroughly cleaned and cat fleas controlled
to prevent cat scratch disease. Persons at risk of Q
fever (abbatoir workers, farmers, researchers)
should be educated on sources of infection and safe
disposal of infected materials (especially birth
products). Milk should be pasteurized. Q fever
vaccine is available for those at high risk in some
countries.
PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Rifampicin may be useful for ehrlichiosis in

pregnancy or in children.
Co-trimoxazole or the newer macrolides (e.g.
azithromycin) are useful for the treatment of Q
fever in children.
Erythromycin 10-15 mg/kg qds for 7-10 days may
also be used to treat Q fever in children.

Relapsing fevers
Relapsing fevers are acute febrile illnesses caused by Borrelia
spirochaetes which, if untreated, will relapse repeatedly between
afebrile intervals of 5-9 days. Epidemic louse-borne relapsing fever,
caused by Borrelia recurrentis, is transmitted by human body lice
(Pediculus humanus). It is now confined to the horn of Africa. Endemic
tick-borne relapsing fever is caused by more than 15 Borrelia species
and transmitted by a variety of soft (argasid) ticks (genus
Ornithodoros). It is widely distributed in tropical and temperate
countries except Australasia and Pacific islands. Rarely, these
spirochaetes can be transmitted by blood transfusion.

Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)
Transmission:
lice are infected by feeding on human blood. They transmit B.
recurrentis to a new human host not by bites but through
contamination of broken skin or intact mucosae by their coelomic fluid
when ruptured by scratching. Humans are the sole host and reservoir.
Transmission tends to increase in the cold, rainy season when people
wear more clothes and crowd together indoors for warmth, conditions
that encourage louse infestation. Historically, LBRF has caused massive
pandemics in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe (1903-36, 50 million
cases with 5 million deaths; 1943-6 10 million cases), exacerbated by
wars, crowding, floods, famines, and forced migration.

Clinical features:
after an incubation period of 4-17 (average 7) days, there is sudden
high fever, chills, headache, confusion, myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue,
dizziness, cough, anorexia, nightmares, and prostration. Examination
reveals bleeding (epistaxes, subconjunctival haemorrhages,
petechiae), tender splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, jaundice, and
chest signs. The first attack ends dramatically with a febrile crisis,
either spontaneously on about the fifth day if untreated or with a
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction precipitated by antibiotic treatment.
Inadequately treated patients may suffer their first relapse about one
week later. Subsequent attacks tend to be less severe. Pregnant
women are at high risk of abortion. Death is due to myocarditis, liver
failure, severe bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, DIC and hepatic
dysfunction, ruptured spleen, splenic infarctions, and bacterial
superinfection (dysentery, salmonellosis, typhoid, typhus, malaria,
tuberculosis). During the J-Hr, patients may die from hyperpyrexia,
hypovolaemic shock, or pulmonary oedema. Untreated case fatalities
of 40% or higher have been reported during epidemics. Treatment can
reduce this to <5%.

Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (J-Hr):
Within a few hours of treatment, the patient becomes restless and
then develops rigors with soaring temperature, respiratory and pulse
rates, and blood pressure, associated with vomiting, diarrhoea,
coughing and delirium. This is followed by the flush phase during which
there is profuse sweating and vasodilatation sometimes complicated
by hypovolaemic shock or acute pulmonary oedema attributable to
myocarditis. The incidence of J-Hr varies from 33-100%.

Fig. 18.2 Blood film showing several Borrelia duttoni spirochaetes
in a patient with untreated TBRF.

Fig. 18.3 (Left): soft tick (genus Ornithodoros) vector of louse-

borne relapsing fever; (right): hard tick (genus Ixodes). Hard ticks
are the vectors of Lyme disease, rickettsial infections, and tickborne encephalitis.

Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF)
Transmission:
ticks are infected by feeding on animal or human blood or acquire
spirochaetes congenitally (transovarially). They transmit borreliae to a
new animal or human host via their saliva while taking a blood meal or
by contaminating the bite wound with their coxal gland secretion.
They are reservoirs as well as vectors. Peri-domestic rodents are the
main vertebrate reservoir. Ecology and species of borreliae and tick
vary geographically. Only classic East African TBRF (B. duttonii
transmitted by O. moubata complex) is not a zoonosis. Risk of infection
is associated with sleeping in tick and rodent friendly thatched or mud
houses or log cabins. Tick bites are painless. They feed for only a few
hours at night and then drop off, so exposure is usually unsuspected.

Clinical features:
after an incubation period of 2-18 days, presenting symptoms are
similar to those in LBRF but are usually milder and less protracted.
Epistaxis, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and cough are described.
Splenomegaly and splenic infarction are common but hepatomegaly
and jaundice are unusual. Transient neurological problems occur in 510% of patients: paraesthesiae, cranial never palsies (especially VII),
visual symptoms, hemiparesis or paraparesis, lymphocytic meningitis.
Various erythematous and petechial rashes may appear. Fever may
recur up to 13 times, separated by gaps of a few days to 3 weeks in
untreated patients. Pregnancy is aborted in up to one third of cases.

Diagnosis:
diagnosis of LBRF is by finding spirochaetes (sometimes >500,000/mm3)

in Giemsa-stained blood films. In TBRF, spirochaetaemia may be
scanty and intermittent. Peripheral neutrophil leucocytosis is followed
by leukopenia after the febrile crisis. Serology is not useful.
Thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and liver dysfunction are common.

Management of relapsing fever
Single-dose antibiotic therapy is curative for LBRF:
Adults: tetracycline 500 mg PO (for sick patients, 250 mg IV) stat.
Pregnant women or children: erythromycin adult 500 mg children 10
mg/kg PO (for sick patients, erythromycin IV) stat or
For mixed infections with louse-borne typhus (adults): doxycycline
100-200 mg PO stat.
Benzylpenicillin and chloramphenicol are also effective.
For TBRF, longer courses of the same drugs (e.g. adults: tetracycline
500 mg qds PO for 10 days) are required.
Consider treating complicating bacterial infections (typhoid etc.)
For the severe J-Hr precipitated by antibiotics:
Control pyrexia by physical cooling.
Prevent hypovolaemia with IV fluids.
Nurse in bed for 48-72 h to prevent fatal postural hypotension.
Treat acute pulmonary oedema 2° to myocarditis with digoxin.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Control of relapsing fever
LBRF: delouse infested clothes (heat, insecticide);
bathe patients (soap and 1% Lysol [Cresol]*);
decontaminate using 10% DDT, 0.5-1% malathion,
2% temephos, 1% propoxur, or 0.5-1%
permethrin. This is essential to control an epidemic.
TBRF: kill or deter ticks with residual insecticides in

dwellings, repellents (DEET), improved house
contruction, rodent control.

Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis is primarily a disease of wild and domestic mammals,
which may asymptomatically pass large numbers of leptospires in their
urine. All pathogenic leptospires are spirochaetes belonging to the
genus Leptospira, the taxonomy of which continues to evolve. They
can be divided by phenotyping into 24 serogroups and >250 serovars,
and by genotyping into >17 genomospecies. However, there is no
relationship between the infecting serovar and clinical manifestations
or severity of illness in humans. Leptospirosis in endemic regions is
usually related to agricultural exposure and is increasingly recognized
in travellers returning from developing countries.

Transmission
Leptospires enter the body through cuts or abrasions of skin or mucous
membranes after immersion in contaminated water (pools, canals,
rivers), or through close animal contact. Rats are the most common
source of human infection in developing countries, and dogs and
livestock in industrialized countries. Following infection,
leptospiraemia develops and the spirochaetes spread to multiple
organs. Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis reflect organ
dysfunction resulting from direct effects of leptospires and/or host
immune responses to infection.

Clinical features
These vary from subclinical infection, through a self-limiting febrile
illness, to a potentially lethal multi-system illness with jaundice, renal
failure, and pulmonary haemorrhage (Weil's syndrome):
Subclinical infection — common in endemic areas where
seroprevalence is typically 5-10%.
Clinical disease — 1-3 weeks post-infection there is sudden onset of

fever, headache, severe myalgia, nausea and vomiting, and
conjunctival suffusion or haemorrhage. In severe infection, the
patient is prostrate with high fever, haemoptysis, dyspnoea,
jaundice, and symptoms and signs of respiratory, renal, or multiorgan dysfunction which mimics sepsis syndrome. In mild cases, a 2day remission occurs after 4-7 days, but this may progress to a
second immunopathological phase. If this is severe, the patient's
condition worsens with persistent high fever, myocarditis,
widespread haemorrhage, renal failure, and shock.
Death in leptospirosis is due to multi-organ failure. Severe
pulmonary haemorrhage (2° to endothelial damage rather than
consumption of clotting factors) has been reported as an important
cause of death in recent epidemics in Central America and Southeast
Asia.

Diagnosis
Early diagnosis is difficult due to the non-specific presentation similar
to other infections that present as undifferentiated febrile syndrome
(e.g. malaria, dengue, and rickettsial infections). Definitive diagnosis
of leptospirosis is made by recovery of leptospires from clinical
specimens or detection of leptospiral antibodies. Leptospires can be
isolated from blood or CSF during the first 7-10 days of illness, and
from urine during the
2nd and 3rd week of illness. Culture is difficult, requires several weeks
of incubation, and has low sensitivity. The microagglutination test is
the standard for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis. Several rapid
serological tests, using whole Leptospira antigen preparations, have
been developed. All of these have low sensitivity (39-72%) during the
acute phase of illness, but serology 10-21 days into the illness is more
sensitive.

Management
Management combines supportive treatment with antibiotic therapy;
antibiotics should be used at any stage of leptospirosis.
Mild disease: doxycycline 100 mg bd for 7 days, started within 3 days

of the onset of symptoms, will hasten recovery.
Moderate or severe disease: benzylpenicillin 1.2-2.4 g IV q6 h for 5-7
days (even if the patient has been ill for several days).
Alternatives for severe disease: ampicillin 1 g IV q6 h or cefotaxime
1-2 g IV q12 h or ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV od. Chloramphenicol is NOT
effective.
Severe disease may require organ support including haemodialysis in
an ICU setting.
The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction may occur 4-6h after initiation of IV
antibiotics in some patients.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of leptospirosis
Education of at-risk groups to reduce exposure.
Control rodent populations.
Vaccinate domestic animals.
Consider chemoprophylaxis in very high-risk
groups e.g. sewer workers — the protective
efficacy of doxycycline 200 mg weekly is ~95%.

Brucellosis
A chronic granulomatous disease of worldwide distribution caused by
the Gram-negative bacillus, Brucella. Four species are responsible for
almost all human infections, namely Brucella melitensis (majority of
cases), B. abortis, B. suis, B. canis. The organism lives and multiplies
within phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system. The cellular
immune response, in particular the interferon-γ pathway, is important
in pathogenesis.

Transmission
Brucellosis is predominately an occupational disease of those working

with animals or their products (tissue, blood, urine, vaginal discharges,
aborted fetuses and placentas). Entry is through breaks in the skin or
inhalation of aerosols (stables, abbatoirs and laboratories). Sporadic
cases and outbreaks occur following ingestion of unpasteurized dairy
products (particularly soft cheese, milk, butter and ice-cream).

Clinical features
A variable incubation period (usually 2-4 weeks, may be months) is
followed by acute or insidious onset of fever (may be rigors),
constitutional symptoms, and malodorous perspiration.
Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly may be present.
Complications can affect virtually any organ system, including:
Osteoarticular (spondylitis, peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis).
Reproductive (epididymoorchitis, spontaneous abortion).
Hepatitis, peritonitis.
Central nervous system (meningitis, encephalitis, abscess).
Endocarditis (responsible for most mortality).

Diagnosis
The serum agglutination test is most widely used (single titre >1:160 or
rising titre), but cross-reacts with other Gram-negatives. ELISA (IgG,
IgM, IgA) has greater sensitivity and specificity. PCR is promising.
Culture from blood or tissue is confirmatory, but is relatively
insensitive and requires prolonged incubation.

Management
Doxycycline (200 mg PO od for 6 weeks) plus either streptomycin (15
mg/kg (max 1 g) IM daily for 2-3 weeks) or rifampicin (600-900 mg PO
od for 6 weeks). Relapse occurs in ~10% and should be treated with the
same regimen. Ciprofloxacin/ofloxacin plus either rifampicin or
doxycycline may be an alternative. Rifampicin and co-trimoxazole are
useful in pregnancy.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Paediatric doses
Use combination regimen of 2 or the following:
rifampicin 15 mg/kg (max 600 mg) PO od for 6
weeks.
co-trimoxazole: sulphamethoxazole 20 mg/kg +
trimethorpim 4 mg/kg (max 800 mg + 160 mg) PO
bd for 6 weeks.
gentamicin 2.5 mg/kg IV or IM) tds for 2 weeks.
PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention and Control
Pasteurize (or boil) milk products.
Protective clothing for those at risk.
Screen livestock by serology or by testing cow's
milk and eliminate infected animals.
Vaccinate animals in high prevalence areas;
vaccinate animals using live attenuated vaccine (no
human vaccine is available; the vaccine strain may
cause disease in humans if accidentally inoculated).
Identify the source of outbreaks (usually milk or
milk products from an infected herd); recall all
affected products.

Plague
An acute illness caused by the Gram negative coccobacillus, Yersinia
pestis, that can be rapidly fatal unless treatment is started early.
Empirical antibiotic therapy is thus essential when clinical suspicion is
high. It is enzootic among animals (mainly rodents) in many countries

in Africa, S.E. Asia, and the Americas (including S.W. USA) and
occasionally infects humans.
The most common clinical form is bubonic plague, in which bacteria
spread to lymph nodes. Bubonic plague has a 1-15% death rate in
treated cases and a 40-60% death rate if not treated.
Primary pneumonic plague occurs after inhalation of bacteria in
droplets coughed from a patient with pneumonic plague, resulting in
a fulminant pneumonia and sepsis which is uniformly fatal if not
treated within 24 h. Pneumonic plague might also occur as a result
of biological warfare or terrorism. Secondary pneumonic plague may
complicate septicaemic plague.
Septicaemic plague may be primary, or occur as a complication of
bubonic or pneumonic plague. Infection may spread to every organ
including the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and, rarely, CSF causing
meningitis. The mortality is ~40% in treated cases and ~100% in
untreated cases.

Transmission
Bubonic plague is transmitted via the bite of infected rodent fleas.
Most sporadic human infection comes from sylvatic rodents (e.g.
ground squirrels, prairie dogs), occasionally from domestic cats.
Outbreaks, however, are associated with urban rats, and spectacular
die-offs of rats may herald an outbreak. Pneumonic plague is
transmitted from person to person.

Clinical features
Bubonic plague:
the first specific sign is usually local lymphadenitis in the nodes
draining the site of the flea bite. After 2-7 (always <15) days, a ‘bubo’
forms in these nodes. There is typically a short prodrome of fever,
malaise, headache, and, in some cases, a dull ache in the nodes for up
to 24 h before the bubo is apparent. The enlarged nodes are extremely
painful and swollen, the overlying skin warm, red, oedematous, and

adherent. The mass is non-fluctuant and immobile.

Pneumonic plague:
initially intense headache, malaise, fever, vomiting, prostration. Later,
cough, dyspnoea, bloodstained sputum with few chest signs, ↓
consciousness. CXR shows multilobar consolidation or
bronchopneumonia — paucity of chest signs compared with the CXR is
characteristic. This picture needs to be distinguished from ARDS, which
may occur in bubonic and septicaemic forms of plague. Rapid
deterioration and death from multi-organ/respiratory failure is
common.

Septicaemic plague:
presents with fulminant sepsis, multi-organ failure, and skin bleeding.

Diagnosis
Fever plus localized lymphadenopathy in endemic area; aspiration of a
bubo for culture and Giemsa/Gram-stained smear (bipolar
coccobacillus); blood, sputum, CSF for culture; acute and convalescent
serology. Antigen detection directly on clinical samples, if available,
may give rapid diagnosis.

Management
For severe disease: antibiotics must be started without delay and
continued for 7-10 days:
Most clinical experience is with streptomycin 15 mg/kg IM bd.
Alternatives with good activity in vitro, but comparatively little
clinical experience include: gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV od; ciprofloxacin
10-15 mg/kg (max 750 mg) IV/PO bd; chloramphenicol 25 mg/kg (max
750 mg) IV/PO qds (treatment of choice for meningitis).
For milder cases: tetracycline 500-1000 mg PO qds or doxycycline 100
mg PO bd (avoid tetracyclines in children).

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Control of plague
Control rodents and fleas — fleas must be dealt
with before rodents during outbreaks.
Avoid contact with reservoir species (surveillance,
public education)
Vaccination (currently not generally available).
Notify suspected cases to both local health
authorities and the WHO.
Isolate pneumonic plague patients until at least 3
days after starting antibiotics and clinically
improving — they are highly infectious.
Consider prophylaxis with tetracycline for close
contacts of pneumonic plague (2-3 m) and medical
staff.

Melioidosis
A disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei that is
endemic in south and southeast Asia (including the Indian
subcontinent), northern Australia, the Caribbean, and probably
elsewhere in the tropics. It is a major cause of septicaemia in N.E.
Thailand. The bacterium is present in mud and surface water (rice
paddy); people in regular contact with either are probably infected by
inoculation or inhalation.

Clinical features
Clinical presentation may occur acutely following infection or after a
latent period of up to several years. Infection is often subclinical;
clinical illness commonly presents as septicaemia, or focal infection of
the lung (cavitating pneumonia with profound weight loss which may
be confused with TB), bone, or (in children) parotid glands (although

any organ may be affected). Septicaemia causes rapid deterioration
with metastatic abscesses in lung, liver, and spleen. A failure to
respond to empirical regimens for sepsis (e.g. penicillin plus
aminoglycosides) may suggest this diagnosis in endemic regions.

Glanders
is a similar disease of horses caused by Burkholderia mallei; although
transmission to humans is described as very rare.

Diagnosis
Culture of clinical specimens (blood, pus, sputum, etc). Burkholderia
pseudomallei grows on most routine culture media, but an oxidasepositive gram-negative rod may be disregarded as an environmental
pseudomonad — therefore be alert to the diagnosis in the right
clinical and epidemiological setting. Its identity may be confimed by
biochemical tests and characteristic colonies on Ashdown's media.
Direct immunofluorescence of clinical specimens.
Serology — problems of specificity and sensitivity, particularly in
endemic areas where a large proportion of the population may have
serological evidence of previous infection.

Management
Treat sepsis with intravenous antibiotics: ceftazidime 50 mg/kg (max
2 g) tds for at least 14 days or until clinical improvement
(alternatives: co-amoxiclav, imipenem, meropenem).
Then give oral therapy to prevent relapse: either co-trimoxazole 960
mg (child 480 mg) bd plus doxycycline 100 mg bd for 20 weeks, plus
chloramphenicol 500 mg qds for the first 4 wks; or co-amoxiclav 625
mg tds + amoxicillin 500 mg tds for 20 wks.
The oral regimen above may be given intravenously for sepsis in
beta-lactam allergic patients (or if beta-lactams not available), but
it is not as effective as ceftazidime.
Resistance to these drugs may develop during treatment.

Anthrax

P.702

Anthrax is a zoonosis resulting from infection with the spores of the
Gram-positive rod Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax is a disease of a variety
of grazing animals (sheep, cattle, goats) in parts of Asia, Africa, South
and Central America, southern Europe, the Caribbean, and the Middle
East. The resistant spores may remain viable in soil or animal products
for many years.

Transmission
Anthrax is primarily an occupational disease of workers who process
hides, hair, bone products, and wool and of those who handle infected
animals (veterinarians, wildlife workers). Spores may be dispersed by
wind, water, scavengers, or transport of animal products. Outbreaks
can occur following ingestion of contaminated meat. Since anthrax
spores are resistant and can be aerosolized, they have been used as
agents of bioterrorism.

Clinical presentation
Cutaneous anthrax accounts for 95% of naturally occurring cases.
Spores are inoculated into the skin through abrasions or cuts. A short
incubation period (typically 1-5 days) is followed by an itchy papule
which progresses to a vesicle, ulcer, and, finally, a painless black
eschar with extensive local oedema and surrounding purple vesicles.
This heals spontaneously in 1-3 weeks; however, bacteraemic spread
and overwhelming septicaemia may occur. Neck lesions may lead to
airway obstruction — consider early tracheostomy.
Inhalational anthrax usually occurs 1-4 days following exposure, but
may be delayed for up to 98 days. This biphasic illness presents with
symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection followed by
sudden onset of haemorrhagic mediastinitis with fever, hypoxia,
dyspnoea and shock. Treatment in the late stages is usually
unsuccessful, with mortality rates of up to 90%.
Gastrointestinal anthrax follows ingestion of contaminated meat.

Severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhoea, massive ascites, and
sepsis occur. Mortality is >50%.
Other forms include meningitis (which may complicate any of the
other forms) and oropharyngeal anthrax.

Diagnosis
Rapid diagnosis is by demonstrating bacilli in smears from fluid from
under the eschar, or other site-of-disease sample (or using newer
methods such as PCR, direct immunofluorescence). Culture blood,
lymph node, or CSF.

Management
Early, aggressive antibiotic therapy is vital: give benzylpenicillin 2.4
g IV 4 hourly for 10 days. Naturally (or genetically modified)
penicillin-resistant mutants can occur, so some authorities
recommend substitute (or add) ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV bd followed
by 500 mg PO bd for 60 days (optimum duration not yet established).
Doxycycline is an alternative.
Surgical debridement of the black, necrotic eschar is
contraindicated. The eschar becomes sterile in <2 days.
Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered following possible
aerosol exposure: ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO bd for 60 days.

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention of anthrax
Disinfection: spores are resistant to dessication,
heat, UV light, gamma irradiation, and many
disinfectants. For disinfection of discharge from
lesions or soiled materials use hypochlorite,
hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, or
gluteraldehyde (or burn or autoclave where
possible).

Vaccination: Immunize high-risk persons with cellfree, supernatant-derived vaccine (regular boosters
required).
Veterinary public health measures: disposal of
infected carcases (incinerate at site, do not bury or
transport if possible); vaccination of all domestic
animals at risk (with annual re-immunization).
Control occupational exposure: control dust;
ventilate work areas; wear protective clothing;
disinfect wool/hides/bone prior to processing.
PAEDIATRIC DOSES
Paediatric doses
Ciprofloxacin 10-15 mg/kg (max 400 mg) IV bd followed by 10-15
mg/kg (max 500 mg) PO bd.
If penicillin susceptible, use IV benzylpenicillin 150 mg/kg daily in
4 divided doses.
For children >12 years, use adult doses (see text).

African trypanosomiasis
Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also called ‘sleeping sickness’, is
a protozoan disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei spp. that is
confined to sub-Saharan Africa. Two forms exist — see Fig.18.4.

Transmission:
the disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of tsetse flies, genus
Glossina. Humans are usually infected by T.b. gambiense around
waterholes or rivers and by T.b. rhodesiense in areas of savanna or
recently cleared bush. Humans are the principal reservoir of T.b.
gambiense but are incidental hosts of T.b. rhodesiense, which is a
zoonosis that affects game animals and cattle.

Pathogenesis:
after inoculation, a local inflammatory reaction results in an itchy,
painful chancre (T.b. rhodesiense) and regional lymphadenopathy (both
T.b. rhodesiense and T.b. gambiense). Invasion of the bloodstream and
lymphoreticular system follows — the haemolymphatic (early) stage.
Trypanosomes then invade the CNS, producing the
meningoencephalitic (late) stage of the disease. Trypanosomes escape
the host immunological response by changing their surface antigens
(antigenic variation).

Clinical features:
T.b. gambiense HAT is a chronic disease that develops insidiously.
Evolution towards the late stage of the disease and death generally
takes months or years. By contrast, T.b. rhodesiense HAT is usually an
acute, sometimes fulminant disease. Both forms are almost invariably
fatal if left untreated.

Gambian trypanosomiasis
A chancre is rarely seen at the site of inoculation. After an
asymptomatic period of months-years, the early stage of infection is
characterized by irregular fevers with fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia,
pruritus, and headaches. Lymphadenopathy, often in the posterior
cervical triangle (Winterbottom's sign), is common; lymph nodes are
soft and non-tender; splenomegaly is rare. Trypanosome invasion of
the CNS results in headaches, changes in personality, apathy, and
forgetfulness; psychosis (abnormal behaviour, agitation, delusions) may
also occur. A variety of CNS signs may be seen: pyramidal (focal motor
weakness), extra-pyramidal (a resting tremor is common), and
cerebellar (ataxia). Late features include daytime somnolence
progressing to coma and seizures. Patients ultimately die of starvation,
intercurrent bacterial infections, or convulsions.

Rhodesian trypanosomiasis
An area of painful induration — the 1° chancre — often develops at the

bite site, subsiding by 2-3 wks. After a 1-3 wk incubation period,
trypanosomes enter the blood causing an acute severe illness with high
fever, chills, malaise, severe headaches, weight loss, myalgia, and
arthralgia. An erythematous rash that may be macular, papular, or
circinate sometimes occurs. The disease often runs a fulminant course
with multiple-organ failure and early death. CNS involvement produces
meningoencephalitis that progresses rapidly and is fatal within 1-3
months if untreated. Myocarditis, resulting in atrial or ventricular
dysrhythmia or heart failure, may precede meningoencephalitis.

Epidemiology of human african trypanosomiasis
Two forms of HAT exist with different clinical and epidemiological
features: T.b. gambiense is present in Central and West Africa, and
T.b. rhodesiense in East Africa. An estimated 50,000-70,000 people
are thought to be currently infected. The incidence of T.b.
gambiense HAT, which had increased sharply during the past
decades in war-torn countries of Africa because of the collapse of
disease control measures, has been on the decrease since year 2000.
Human infections with T.b. rhodesiense are sporadic but outbreaks
occur. Travellers to game parks in East Africa have a significant risk
of being infected.
In Uganda, Rhodesian HAT is expending north-west towards the
Gambian HAT endemic area. This geographical overlap would cause
a significant problem in diagnosis and treatment.

trypanosomiasis. (Reproduced with permission from the WHO)

Fig. 18.5 Bloodstream trypomastigote forms of T. b. rhodesiense
on a peripheral thin blood smear.

Diagnosis:
in most Gambian HAT control programmes, initial screening for
infection relies on the card agglutination trypanosoma test (CATT), a
very sensitive and practical serological test. No such serologic assay
exists for Rhodesian HAT. The direct microscopic observation of
trypanosomes in lymph node aspirates, blood (Giemsa-stained thick
smear, quantitative buffy coat, haematocrit or mini-anion exchange
centrifugation techniques) or CSF (double centrifugation) confirms the
diagnosis. The sensitivity of blood examination is higher for T.b.
rhodesiense because circulating trypanosomes are more numerous.

Staging of disease:
by lumbar puncture is mandatory before considering the use of the
toxic drugs for CNS involvement. CSF findings indicating trypanosomal

meningoencephalitis are the presence of:
Trypanosomes.
Increased number of leukocytes (>5 per mm3) and/or
Elevated total or specific (anti-trypanosomal) IgM in the CSF.

Treatment:
The choice of treatment depends on the stage of the disease and
whether the disease is Gambian or Rhodesian. Note: following a recent
agreement between the pharmaceutical industry and the WHO, drugs
for HAT are being donated to the WHO.

Gambian HAT
Early stage: pentamidine isethionate 4 mg/kg IM od for 7 days.
Late stage: (first choice treatment): eflornithine 100 mg/kg IV qds
for 14 days, diluted in normal saline and infused over 2 h.
Late stage: (alternative only if eflornithine not available):
melarsoprol by slow IV injection (using a glass syringe, or drawing up
and injecting with a plastic syringe as quickly as possible since the
drug binds to plastic); very irritant, avoid extravasation; patients
should remain supine and fasting for ≥5 h after the injection. Strictly
only to be given IV (risk of soft tissue necrosis). Sequential regimen
(i.e. 3 cycles of 3 daily injections of 3.6 mg/kg with a resting period
of 7-10 days between each cycle) are gradually being replaced by the
more practical regimen of 2.2 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days
that showed a similar efficacy and toxicity profile.
Note: resistance to melarsoprol (up to 30% treatment failure) is
present in parts of Angola, Uganda, Central African Republic, DRC, and
southern Sudan. In these areas, eflornithine must be used. Eflornithine
is a safer treatment than melarsoprol provided that adequate nursing
care is given.

Rhodesian HAT

Early stage: suramin 5 mg/kg by slow IV injection on day 1, followed
by 20 mg/kg on days 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31.
Late stage: melarsoprol in sequential regimen. The 10-day
continuous regimen has not been evaluated for T. b. rhodesiense.
Eflornithine is thought to be ineffective.

Adverse effects of drugs used for HAT
Eflornithine: leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, soft tissue
infections, and convulsions.
Melarsoprol: encephalopathic syndrome (see below),
polyneuropathy, severe (sometimes bloody) diarrhoea, and rash.
Pentamidine isethionate: hypoglycemia (frequent), hypotension,
sterile abscess, and pancreatitis (rare).
Suramin: anaphylactic shock, fever, neurological, haematological,
and/or renal toxicity.

Melarsoprol-induced encephalopathic syndrome (ES)
Occurs in 5-10% of treated patients, producing status epilepticus and
coma. Mortality is ~50%. May be partially prevented by oral
prednisolone 1 mg/kg PO od given during melarsoprol treatment.
Onset of fever, tachycardia, headache, tremor, and conjunctival
suffusion during melarsoprol treatment should be considered as a
warning. Melarsoprol treatment should be stopped immediately; it
can be restarted once symptoms subside. Some authorities
recommend the use of high-dose dexamethasone IV (e.g. 30 mg
loading dose followed by 15 mg every 6 h for adults) for treatment
of ES or impending ES.

PAEDIATRIC HEALTH NOTE
HAT in neonates and infants can be 2° to mother-tochild transmission or early exposure to tsetse fly
bites. Delayed diagnosis is common in young children
due to non-specific symptoms and signs. Chronic

neurodevelopmental disorders are common sequelae
of late stage HAT.
Due to decreased bioavailability of eflornithine in
children <12 years, the daily total dose of
eflornithine must be increased to 500-600 mg/kg
(~150 mg/kg qds) in this age group.
PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention and control of HAT
Screening: Gambian HAT control programmes rely
on active case finding through systematic screening
of communities and treatment of all those infected
(human beings are the only significant reservoir).
In areas of low prevalence of Gambian HAT, the
integration of disease management within existing
health structures is a challenge.
Vector control by tsetse fly trapping is cumbersome
but effective, particularly in Rhodesian HAT control
programmes.
In outbreaks of Rhodesian HAT, a combined
programme of vector control, treatment of infected
cattle, and active detection and treatment of
human cases should be implemented.
Challenges: Better diagnostic tools and drugs are
urgently needed.

American trypanosomiasis
A parasitic disease of south and central America, also called Chagas'
disease, that is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi. It may
result in fatal cardiomyopathy and GI tract dilatation. The acute

infection is often subclinical in adults and children, although
potentially severe and fatal in the latter.

Pathogenesis
Parasites invade mesenchymal tissues such as heart muscle and
intestinal smooth muscle where they persist in their amastigote form,
without necessarily re-entering the blood, making detection and
chemotherapy difficult. In ~70% of adults, an adequate immune
response controls infection, producing a benign chronic phase
(‘indeterminate form’). Persistent infection and immune dysregulation
causes chronic disease in 30% of cases: destruction of the GI autonomic
ganglia leading to chronic dilatation of hollow viscera and, in the case
of the heart, arrhythmias.

Transmission
Occurs through contamination of mucous membranes, conjunctivae,
and skin by the faeces of nocturnal house-dwelling reduviid bugs.
Domestic and wild animals are reservoirs for the infection; however,
repeated infection of humans and vector in the absence of natural
hosts can occur. Oral infection may occur: sudden outbreaks may occur
in association with ingestion of accidentally infected food or drink.
Congenital infection occurs, and transmission may also occur via
infected blood products or donor transplant organs.

Clinical features
Acute infection:
most cases are subclinical with non-specific symptoms. Parasites
invading the bite site cause a local swelling, the chagoma, and
lymphadenopathy. If close to the eye, unilateral eyelid oedema may
occur (Romaña's sign), a characteristic feature that remains for about
2 months (c.f. bacterial conjunctivitis which usually only persists for up
to 10 days). 2-4 wks post infection, parasite entry into the blood
coincides with the onset of fever. Other features include: a nonpruritic rash of sharplydefined, small macules on the trunk which fades

after 7-10 days; swelling, particularly of the face; hepatosplenomegaly;
cardiac dysrhythmia or insufficiency; meningoencephalitis (often mild,
but fatal in 710% children).

Chronic infection:
(seropositive cases) is clinically different in the cardiac and digestive
forms (affecting ~25% of infected cases) and the so-called
indeterminate form (~75% of the cases, asymptomatic and with normal
resting ECG, colon and chest X-ray).
The cardiac form includes frequent arrhythmias, conduction disorders,
ventricular aneurisms, thromboembolic events, and risk of sudden
death with progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure ±
valvular incomptence in late stages. 5 stages are recognized on
clinical and echocardiographic criteria (see
p 710).

Fig. 18.6 Distribution of American trypanosomiasis.

Fig. 18.7 Life cycle of T. cruzi: The reduviid bug (B) transmits
infection via its faeces when taking blood meals from animal
reservoirs such as the armadillo (C) or humans (A). (Adapted from
G.Piekarski, Medical parasitology in plates, 1962, with kind
permission of Bayer Pharmaceuticals.)

Stages of chronic cardiac involvement (all have abnormal ECGs):
A — normal echo, no heart failure.
B1 — ventricular ejection fraction > 45%, no clinical heart failure.
B2 — ventricular ejection fraction < 45%, no clinical heart failure.
C — abnormal echo findings, compensated heart failure clinically.
D — abnormal echo findings, refractory heart failure clinically.
The digestive form includes oesophagitis, megaoesophagus, late
dysphagia, and regurgitation of food; megacolon, chronic constipation,
abdominal pain, and (rarely) large bowel obstruction.

Diagnosis
Serology for anti-T. cruzi IgG is the main diagnostic tool. Parasites may
also be detected directly in wet mount or Giemsa-stained blood films
or CSF precipitate; parasite DNA may be detected by PCR. T. rangeli,
which is not a cause of human disease, may be mistaken for T. cruzi.

Management
Acute phase: current treatment is effective at this point. Give
either:
Benznidazole 5-7 mg/kg/day (children 10 mg/kg/day) PO in two
divided doses for 60 days or
Nifurtimox 8-10 mg/kg PO in three divided doses (children 15
mg/kg PO in four divided doses) for 90 days.

Chronic phase: benznidazole is also indicated in this phase but it
may be not so effective.
Symptomatic treatment: is often necessary for later complications:
CCF, arrhythmias (see
pp 344-346), AV block, and sick-sinus
syndrome.
Pacemakers are implanted in patients with severe bradyarrhythmias.
Surgery: may be required for megaoesophagus or megacolon.

PAEDIATRIC NOTE
Congenital infection
Transmission from infected mother to newborn
children varies from 1% to 12% in different Latin
American countries and should be evaluated in
seropositive mothers. Congenital infection is
confirmed by identification of parasites in the infant's
blood and/or detection of infant anti-T. cruzi IgG 6-9
months after birth (assuming vector and other
modes of transmission have been excluded).
Congenital Chagas' disease is considered acute and
requires trypanocide treatment. Notification is
mandatory.
PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention and control of Chagas' disease
Limit exposure to the vector: improved housing,
chemical disinfection of houses.
Promote the use of mosquito nets.
Screen blood for transfusion.
Chagas' disease is a clear example of public policy
success, with 5 separate large-scale vector control
programmes with modern pyrethroid insecticides

being implemented in the last few decades in
different Latin American countries. There is now
mandatory notification of acute cases for intense
epidemiological surveillance. Microepidemics of acute
cases due to oral transmission through contaminated
food such as meat, sugar cane juice, or açai (Euterpe
oleracea) fruit juice, have been described, especially
in the Amazon Region and in the south of Brazil.

Fig. 18.8 T. cruzi as seen in a blood film.

Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar)
A severe systemic protozoal disease, caused by Leishmania donovani or
L. infantum (called L. chagasi in S America). VL is increasing in
incidence and causes major epidemics with high mortality. The disease
is seasonal and geographically focal.

Pathogenesis:
at infection, promastigotes (flagellate form) invade macrophages,
becoming amastigotes (rounded form) which spread within spleen,
bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and other tissues. Infection may be

subclinical, controlled by an efficient cell-mediated immune response.
Latent infections are reactivated during immunosuppression,
especially HIV. In clinical disease, the immune response is ineffective
and the parasite continues to multiply, producing pancytopenia and
profound immunosuppression.

Transmission:
is by the nocturnal bite of female Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia
sandflies. In southern Europe, Brazil, etc. dogs are the major
reservoirs of L. infantum/L. chagasi, a zoonotic form of VL which
affects humans rarely (mainly infants and those with HIV). Humans are
the hosts of highly endemic Indian and E. African L. donovani
parasites, sandflies spreading infection human to human. Patients with
post kalar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) can be long-term reservoirs of
infection.

Clinical features:
~2-6 months' incubation period (asymptomatic) and ~1-4 months
symptoms have elapsed by the time the patient presents. Initially, the
patient may appear relatively well, is ambulant, and has a good
appetite. Afternoon fevers (without rigors) and night sweats develop,
lasting weeks-months. Dry cough and epistaxis are common. The
patient notices wasting, weakness, and abdominal distension or pain
due to the splenomegaly. The spleen enlarges and can reach the RIF,
though a modest splenomegaly is more common. Anaemia causes
fatigue. Diarrhoea, moderate hepatomegaly, ~1-2 cm lymphadenopathy
(in Africa), pedal oedema, darkened skin, and zoster are also seen, as
well as neurologic signs (confusion, ataxia, convulsions, deafness) in
some. Dysentery, pneumonia, and TB may develop due to
immunosuppression; malaria, measles, or influenza can be severe or
fatal. Death is almost inevitable if untreated; it may follow sepsis,
epistaxis, or anaemic heart failure.

During treatment:
3-10% of patients will succumb to the complications above, or die

suddenly from antimonial-induced arrhythmias. The risk of death
during treatment is much higher in those aged >45 yrs or <4 yrs, or with
the following: severe anaemia (Hb<8 g/dL), severe malnutrition (BMI
<13 kg/m2), inability to walk unaided, and symptoms for >5 months.

Diagnosis:
serology — most patients (>90%) have very high anti-Leishmania
antibody titres on the direct agglutination test or a positive rapid
dipstick test (rK39) using recombinant Leishmania antigen. Diagnosis is
confirmed by finding parasites in Giemsa-stained smears of spleen
aspirates (95% sensitive, but requires training) or lymph node/bone
marrow aspirates (60-80% sensitive). Culture of aspirate improves
diagnostic yield; cultures on other media can eliminate differential
diagnoses (e.g. typhoid, brucellosis, miliary TB). In HIV co-infected
patients, parasites are often numerous in skin, gut, liver, and on
bronchoalveolar lavage.

Fig. 18.9 The global distribution of viceral leishmaniasis (kalaazar). The species are L infantum/L. chagasi (dotted area) and L
donovani (hatched area). 90% of all VL cases occur in Bangladesh,
Brazil, India, Nepal, and Sudan. Up to 500,000 cases of kala-azar
occur during an epidemic year.

Fig. 18.10 The female phlebotomine sandfly is about half the size
of a mosquito and feeds nocturnally. Several species transmit
visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis (Courtesy WHO/TDR).

Prevention:
spraying to reduce sandfly vectors (in urban areas) and culling
canine/rodent reservoirs. Insecticide-treated bednets reduce risk of VL
by ~50%. Deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars reduce transmission of
L. infantum/L. chagasi. In areas of human to human spread, case
identification and treatment of visceral leishmaniasis and PKDL cases
reduces transmission.

Management

VL is usually responsive to IM or IV pentavalent antimony (Sbv) — 20
mg/kg IM od for 30 days. Meglumine antimoniate (85 mg Sbv/ml) or
sodium stibogluconate (100 mg Sbv/ml) are equivalent; good-quality
generic stibogluconate is as effective as brand-name preparations.
There is no upper limit on the daily dose. 1° Sbv resistance is a major
problem in India; 2° resistance occurs in relapsed patients. Cardiac
arrhythmias (may be fatal), pancreatitis, and other side-effects are
well-recognised with antimonials, especially in HIV co-infected
patients.
Patients who relapse following the 1st course can be retreated with
the same daily dosage of Sbv for a longer course, ensuring that at least
2 test-of-cure aspirates are parasite-free before the patient is
discharged. Alternative: give infusions of amphotericin B 0.5
mg/kg/day (or 1 mg/kg on alternate days) to a total dose of 15 mg/kg,
or liposomal amphotericin B 2-4 mg/kg/day to a total of >20 mg/kg
over 7-10 days.
Second-choice drugs include paromomycin (also called aminosidine) 15
mg/kg/day IV/IM for 21 days. Miltefosine 2.5 mg/kg/day (for patients
weighing 8-20 kg); 50 mg/day (20-25 kg); or 100 mg/day (>25 kg), for 28
days. It might be teratogenic; do not give to women of childbearing
age unless pregnancy can be prevented during treatment and for 2
mths thereafter; unsafe in lactating mothers.
Drug combinations are logical developments for the future, to prevent
resistance. Sbv 20 mg/kg/day plus paromomycin 15 mg/kg/day, both for
17 days, is a safe combination.
Clinical improvement should be evident in 7-10 days. Response can be
monitored by fever, haemoglobin, and spleen size. A parasitological
response is shown by a negative splenic aspirate (bone marrow or
lymph node if spleen impalpable) at the end of treatment. Clinical
follow-up is important during next 6 months to detect relapse; by 12
months, the person can be considered cured. Relapse rates should be
<5%, except in HIV +ve patients, most of whom will relapse unless
antiretroviral treatment started early; even on ART, many will have
repeated relapses and the VL becomes drug-resistant.

Influenza
Influenza viruses serogroups A, B, and C are RNA viruses that cause
respiratory tract infections in humans. Influenza A can cause epidemic
disease and, rarely, can lead to a global pandemic. Human Influenza is
spread from person to person in respiratory secretions. The virus
evolves through small mutations (‘drift’) and, infrequently,
reassortment of its segmented genome (‘shift’), thereby evading
existing population immunity. Over the last few years, there has been
a global pandemic among poultry and birds of an avian influenza
caused by influenza A (H5N1). This has been associated with a very
worrying but, to date, relatively small number of infections in humans,
usually associated with close exposure to infected poultry. Human
infection with this influenza A (H5N1) virus leads to a severe disease
with very high mortality (approximately 60%) and major concerns that
if the virus adapted to humans it could lead to a global pandemic in
humans akin to the devastating pandemic of ‘Spanish flu’ in 1918. As
yet, there is no evidence of efficient transmission between humans of
the influenza A (H5N1) virus, although there have been a number of
incidents of clustering of cases within families with some evidence of
very limited, inefficient human to human transmission.

Clinical features
The illness starts abruptly. Characteristic features are fever, chills,
headache, coryza, dry cough, and myalgia. The symptoms are worst in
the first 24-48 h and, thereafter, usually improve. In most cases, the
patient recovers fully. The most common and important complication
of human influenza is 2° bacterial pneumonia, usually due to
pneumococcus or Staphylococcus aureus. This accounts for the
significant mortality associated with influenza infection in the elderly
and those with underlying lung disease. Infection with an influenza
virus to which humans have no prior immunity (such as with influenza
A (H5N1) or in primary influenza infection with a human virus) leads to
a severe systemic infection associated with intense viral invasion of
the lungs and other organs. In these cases, patients can deteriorate
very rapidly with progressive severe bilateral multifocal consolidation
and bulla formation. The viral loads (particularly in pharyngeal

secretions) are very much higher in influenza A (H5N1) or in primary
influenza infection and this can lead to an intense inflammatory
response with associated tissue damage.

Diagnosis
Is usually clinical, but can be confirmed by rapid antigen detection
from nose or throat swabs or from samples of respiratory secretions
using PCR and viral culture.

Management
In uncomplicated cases, is supportive. Early treatment with antibiotics
that are active against pneumococcus and Staph aureus (e.g.
amoxicillin plus flucloxacillin) is indicated if there is any clinical
suggestion of 2° pneumonia (e.g. breathlessness, discoloured sputum,
or clinical signs of
pneumonia). There has been little evidence so far of 2° bacterial
infection complicating influenza A (H5N1) disease. Failure to improve
as expected after the first 24-48 h of the illness is a warning sign of the
development of potential complications. In these cases, the patient
needs careful clinical, diagnostic, radiological, and therapeutic
reassessment.

Antiviral agents
The neuroaminidase inhibitors (oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir)
or inhibitors of the M2 membrane protein (amantadine and
rimantadine) have been shown to reduce the duration of illness in
patients with influenza and are recommended in more severe disease.
The maximum benefit is probably gained by early treatment within 48
h of onset of symptoms but there is theoretical benefit for as long as
there is active viral replication. The influenza A (H5N1) outbreaks have
generated a great deal of interest in the development of new
parenteral antiviral agents and combination therapy. It is likely that in
the next few years these will become available. Treatment of close
household contacts of proven cases can reduce 2° transmission and
would be of particular importance in an epidemic or pandemic. There

is increasing resistance to all these drugs and treatment
recommendations would ideally be based on knowledge of the
sensitivity patterns of the circulating strains. There have been a series
of excellent clinical and epidemiological guidelines released relevant
to influenza A (H5N1). See:
www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/index.html

PUBLIC HEALTH NOTE
Prevention
Immunization against known circulating strains is
recommended annually for individuals at high risk
of developing complications.
Prophylaxis of health care workers and other highrisk staff is possible with oral oseltamivir and
inhaled zanamivir, although data on their use long
term (greater than 8 weeks) is not yet available.

Infectious mononucleosis
The clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis (IM) classically
results from infection with the ubiquitous gammaherpes virus EpsteinBarr virus (EBV). An IM-like illness can also be caused by other
organisms including cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus,
and toxoplasma.

Transmission
EBV is transmitted orally via saliva and establishes infection within the
oropharynx and circulating B cells. Individuals are usually infected by
family members in childhood. If not exposed at this stage, they may
acquire EBV during adolescence (‘kissing disease’) or adult life. EBV
persists within the host for life and is intermittently shed in saliva.

Clinical features
Primary EBV infection is usually asymptomatic but causes IM in a very

small proportion of children and in 25-50% adolescents/adults. A 4-7
weeks' incubation period is followed by development of fevers,
malaise, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Hepatitis,
thrombocytopena, palatal petechiae, and a morbilliform rash may
occur. Less commonly, myocarditis, pericarditis, pneumonitis
haemolytic anaemia, or nephritis develops. Symptoms persist for 3-6
weeks and resolve spontaneously. An atypical form of disease in which
neurological features such as meningitis, encephalitis, neuritis, or
transverse myelitis predominate is recognized. IM is rarely fatal,
although deaths have occurred 2° to splenic rupture, upper airway
obstruction, encephalitis, hepatitis, and haemophagocytosis. Very
rarely, a persistent form of disease known as chronic active EBV
infection develops. This is characterized by a high viral load, failure of
maturation of specific humoral immunity, and virus infection of NK or
T cells, and has a 50% mortality rate. Primary EBV infection may also
be fatal in those who are immunosuppressed or suffer from the Xlinked lymphoproliferative syndrome.
The life-long persistent phase of EBV infection is almost always
clinically silent. In a small proportion of individuals, EBV is implicated
in the development of malignancies including nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Persistent virus infection can cause B cell lymphoproliferative disease
in the immunocompromised and hairy oral leukoplakia in those with
HIV infection.

Diagnosis
A lymphocytosis with atypical cells is characteristic of IM. Mild
thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases may occur. IgM
heterophile antibodies reactive with antigens found on sheep/horse
red cells are usually present and are detected by Paul
Bunnell/Monospot tests. IgM antibodies against EBV viral capsid
antigens (VCA) confirm the diagnosis of IM. IgG antibodies specific for
EBV VCA and the EBV nuclear antigen EBNA1 are detectable during
lifelong persistent infection.

Management

The disease is normally self-limiting, requiring only supportive
measures such as hydration, analgesics, or mild non-steroidal agents.
Contact sports should be avoided in view of splenic enlargement.
Prednisolone 0.7 mg/kg for 5-7 days, reducing over next 7 days, may be
used in neurological disease, developing respiratory obstruction, or
where splenic enlargement causes concern. Amoxicillin should be
avoided if treating concomitant bacterial infection as it causes a rash
in 90% patients. High-dose acyclovir reversibly reduces levels of
replicating virus but has not been shown to clearly alter the clinical
course of disease.

Measles
Overall global mortality from measles decreased from ~871,000 in 1999
to ~454,000 in 2004. However, measles still remains a substantial cause
of global childhood mortality. Most of the deaths occur in developing
countries where measles vaccine coverage is low.

Transmission
Measles is a paramyxovirus. It causes a highly contagious illness with
>90% of non-immune people becoming infected if exposed.
Transmission follows inhalation of airborne respiratory droplets from
an infected person's coughing or sneezing. A child is infectious from 1
day before the onset of symptoms until around 5 days after the start of
the rash. The virus can remain infectious in the environment for
several hours. There is no animal reservoir. Infection confers lifelong
immunity.

Risk factors
Unvaccinated or immunocompromised children (e.g. AIDS or
corticosteroid therapy), children living in overcrowded conditions or
visiting health facilities are at increased risk of measles. Previously
uninfected and unvaccinated adolescents are also at increased risk.

Clinical features

Incubation period:
Ranges from 7-14 days.

Prodrome:
Generally occurs around 10-12 days from exposure; begins with mild to
moderate fever and loss of appetite, followed by conjunctivitis, cough,
and coryza. Koplik spots (greyish white spots the size of grains of sand
on the inside of the mouth) appear on the 2nd/3rd day, 24-48 h before
the rash stage. The prodrome usually lasts 2-5 days.

Rash:
The distinctive maculopapular rash appears on the 4th/5th day
following the start of symptoms, usually accompanied by high fever.
The rash is non-pruritic, begins on face and behind the ears, and within
24-36 h spreads to the entire trunk and extremities (palms and soles
rarely involved). It begins to fade 3-5 days after it first appears,
initially to a purplish hue and then to brown/black lesions with fine
scales.

Recovery:
Cough may persist for 1-3 weeks. Measles-associated complications
may cause persisting fever beyond the 3rd day of the rash.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is usually clinical. The WHO defines measles as an illness with
generalized maculopapular rash and fever with at least one of the
following: cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis. In presence of distinctive
clinical symptoms and a history of exposure, laboratory diagnosis is
seldom required but, if needed, the following can be used:
Serology: measles-specific IgM or 4-fold rise in measles IgG antibody
titres between the acute and the convalescent phase.
Microscopy: detection of multinucleate giant cells with inclusion

bodies in nasopharyngeal secretions during the prodrome.
Immunofluorescence can be used to demonstrate measles virus
antigens in cells from nasopharyngeal specimens and urine.
Virus isolation: measles virus can be isolated from throat or
conjunctival washings, sputum, urine, and lymphocytes.

Fig. 18.12 Time course of measles infection.

Complications of measles
Severe measles is more common among unvaccinated young children
and adults; immunocompromised, malnourished, or vitamin A-deficient
children; or children living in overcrowded conditions. Vaccinated
children usually have milder measles. In developing countries, at least
one complication is expected in a large proportion of measles cases

and one child may have several complications.
Pneumonia is the most common complication and the most common
cause of measles-associated deaths. Measles accounts for 6-21% of all
cases of acute lower respiratory infections. In developing countries,
8-66% of measles cases may have pneumonia with widely varying
case-fatality rates. Respiratory symptoms are a characteristic part
of measles presentation and are assumed to be due to viral
pneumonitis. In a minority, this progresses to severe giant cell
pneumonia, which is characteristically a chronic illness in patients
who are immunocompromised. Secondary respiratory infection is
usually encountered when a patient is on the way to recovery 7-10
days after the onset of rash. The predominant bacteria are S.
aureus, E.coli, Pseudomonas, S. pneumoniae, and other
Streptococcus spp.
Diarrhoea is the 2nd most common complication of measles. 1-7% of
all diarrhoea episodes and 9-77% of all diarrhoea deaths in under-5yr-olds in developing countries are measles-associated. From 8-80%
of measles cases may have diarrhoea, with variable case-fatality
rates. Most measles-associated diarrhoea occurs within 4 days of
rash onset. Limited data shows that the distribution of diarrhoeal
pathogens is similar in diarrhoeal patients with or without measles.
Other serious complications include blindness, acute encephalitis,
and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Incidence of
blindness has decreased due to vitamin A supplementation
programmes and administration of vitamin A during measles. Acute
encephalitis occurs in ~1/10,00 cases. SSPE occurs years after the
primary illness in ~1/100,000 cases.
Other common complications include acute malnutrition, mouth
ulceration, and otitis media. Immune suppression and increased
incidence of pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition persist after
the acute illness, lasting ~6-8 weeks from rash onset.

Management
In most patients, measles is an acute self-limiting disease.

Ensure adequate nutrition, hydration, and support, including
education of mother about complications.
Give vitamin A (dose and regimen,
p 649). This corrects vitamin A
deficiency, decreases severity of illness and case-fatality.
If specific symptoms/signs or conditions are present:
Give paracetamol for high fever (>38.5°C).
Treat mouth ulcers with gentian violet 0.25%.
Give topical antibiotics if cornea cloudy or pus draining from the
eyes.
Manage diarrhoea/dysentery and dehydration as outlined on
248.

p

Give broad-spectrum antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media
or 2° pneumonia.
The role of antibiotic prophylaxis for 2° bacterial pneumonia has not
been established.

Control of measles
All children should be immunized: Give 1st dose of measles vaccine
at the age of 9 months or shortly thereafter. At least 90% of children
should be immunized. A ‘second opportunity’ for measles
immunization is provided to all children. This assures measles
immunity in children who failed to receive a previous dose of
measles vaccine, as well as in those who were vaccinated but failed
to develop immunity (10-15% of children vaccinated at 9 months of
age). Providing measles vaccine to displaced persons living in camp
settings within a week of entry should be a public health priority.
(Measles vaccine is covered further on
p 821). Measles
surveillance enables prompt recognition and investigation of
outbreaks, and provides information on programme impact.

Other signs that may warrant admission include:

convulsions/LOC, laryngeal obstruction, and marked dehydration. If
the child is malnourished or underweight, these signs should be
considered with greater seriousness.

Arboviruses
Arboviruses are transmitted to man by arthropod vectors — insects
(mosquitoes, sandflies) and ticks. A large number cause clinical
disease. They occur throughout the world (although the geographical
range of individual viruses is limited) and most are zoonoses (infection
in man is incidental) but may become epidemic. The illnesses caused
by arbovirus infections can be broadly classified into four overlapping
syndromes:
1. Acute benign fever, with or without rash
2. Acute encephalitis
3. Haemorrhagic fever (see later)
4. Polyarthritis and rash
Overall, dengue causes more illness and death than any other arboviral
infection. Locally, other viruses may be more important. Yellow fever
has the potential to cause disastrous epidemics. Japanese encephalitis
— a common and important arboviral infection in parts of Asia — is
considered on
p 413.

Dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever
Dengue is transmitted from infected to susceptible humans by daybiting Aedes mosquitoes — domestic mosquitoes that breed in humanmade containers. There are four viral serotypes (1, 2, 3, and 4).
Infection with one serotype does not induce solid immunity to the
other serotypes, and so an individual may be infected with dengue
more than once. Dengue is not transmitted directly from one person to
another and, therefore, no special infection control measures are

required for suspected cases in hospital.
The most intense transmission occurs in South-east Asia, but in recent
years there have been dramatic increases in dengue transmission in
the Indian subcontinent and the Western hemisphere. An estimated 50100 million people are infected with dengue each year. In established
areas of intense dengue transmission (such as S.E. Asia), almost all
infections occur in children, and adults are immune to locally
circulating serotypes of dengue virus. In contrast, if a particular
serotype of dengue is newly transmitted in a geographical area, both
adults and children will become infected.

Clinical features and classification:
Dengue virus infection may be subclinical, may present as an
undifferentiated febrile disease with maculopapular rash (particularly
in infants and young children), or may result in a typical febrile illness
with or without bleeding and/or shock. Conventionally, typical dengue
syndromes have been classified into two groups, classical dengue fever
(DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Current diagnostic criteria
for DHF are based on clinical observation and simple laboratory tests —
see box
p 725. The presence of vascular leak is the key feature that
distinguishes DHF from DF. Individual patients may have varying
degrees of bleeding and/or shock (and sometimes other serious
complications, such as encephalitis) and, therefore, the clinical utility
and specificity of the current classification is limited.

recent dengue activity and the grey areas are those at risk in the
future. (Reproduced from the WHO Report on Gllobal Surveillance
of Epidemic-prone Infectious Diseases with permission of the
WHO.)

WHO case definition of DHF
The following must all be present:
1. Fever, or history of acute fever
2. Haemorrhagic tendencies, evidenced by at least one of:
Positive tourniquet test.
Petechiae, ecchymoses, or purpura.
Bleeding.
3. Thrombocytopaenia
4. Evidence of plasma leakage
Haematocrit >20% above average.
Drop in haematocrit >20% after volume replacement.
Clinical signs (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites).

WHO case definition of DSS
All of the above, plus evidence of circulatory failure including:
Rapid and weak pulse.

Narrow pulse pressure (<20 mmHg ).
or
Hypotension.
Cold, clammy skin and restlessness.

Laboratory diagnosis:
requires specialist laboratories, so is not routinely available in parts of
the world where dengue is most prevalent. Rapid bedside tests for
dengue are currently under development. Dengue viraemia correlates
well with temperature, thus virus can be isolated (or confirmed by PCR
or viral antigen detection) in a febrile patient with dengue.
Conversely, once the fever has resolved, serology is more useful.

Dengue fever (DF)
DF begins abruptly 3-15 (usually 5-8) days after an infected mosquito
bite. Fever is often accompanied by severe headache, retro-orbital
pain, and intense myalgia and arthralgia (hence name ‘break bone
fever’). A blanching rash typically appears after a few days; it is a
useful clue to diagnosis, if present. DF usually lasts for 4-7 days,
followed by complete recovery. Severe complications are uncommon
and include: bleeding without evidence of vascular leak (therefore not
fulfilling case definition of DHF), in particular of GI tract and
menorrhagia; encephalopathy; encephalitis.

Management:
is symptomatic. Avoid aspirin because of bleeding risk.

Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)
DHF usually begins in the same way as DF, but after 2-7 days, signs of
bleeding and increased vascular permeability become apparent. The
most severely ill patients have evidence of circulatory failure known
as dengue shock syndrome (DSS) — see box
p 725. Without
treatment, mortality is high in patients with DSS, but this is reduced to

1-5% by careful supportive care.

Treatment:
Prompt restoration of the volume of circulating plasma is the
cornerstone of therapy. Initial resuscitation with Ringer's lactate is
indicated for children with moderately severe DSS (pulse pressure 1020 mmHg ); for those with severe shock (pulse pressure <10 mmHg ),
colloid is used if available e.g. 6% hydroxyethyl starch. The vascular
leak syndrome typically resolves within 24-48 h, and careful monitoring
is required to avoid fluid overload during the recovery phase.
Pulmonary oedema secondary to fluid overload can contribute to
mortality.

Prevention:
There is currently no vaccine. Vector control is effective but difficult
to sustain.

Fig. 18.14 Transmission cycles of yellow fever in Africa. (A) Jungle
yellow fever is enzootic (but usually asymptomatic) among
monkeys and baboons, transmitted by Aedes africanus. (B)
Savannah yellow fever occurs when Aedes simpsoni mosquitoes
leave the forest to feed on humans living in villages nearby. (C)
Urban yellow fever occurs when the viraemic patient travels to

the town and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes become infected. This can
lead to large epidemics in unvaccinated populations.

Yellow fever
Yellow fever (YF) is a flavivirus that is transmitted by several different
culicine mosquitoes. Accurate YF incidence data are lacking — there
are ~200,000 cases/year and >30,000 deaths. YF occurs mainly in subSaharan Africa; there are far fewer cases in tropical South America
and YF does not occur in Asia.

Transmission:
(see Fig.18.14): the primary transmission cycle involves non-human
primates, but humans may be ‘accidentally’ infected when they are
bitten by an infected mosquito. The disease may then be spread by
mosquitoes from infected human to susceptible human, causing
explosive epidemics in urban environments.

Clinical features:
illness begins abruptly 3-6 days after the bite of an infected mosquito.
Characteristic features are fever, chills, headache, widespread
myalgia, conjunctival congestion, and relative bradycardia (Faget's
sign). After several days, the majority of patients recover. Others
deveop a life-threatening illness with increasing fever, jaundice, renal
failure, and bleeding (due to thrombocytopaenia and coagulopathy).
Death is preceded by shock, agitated delirium, stupor, and coma.

Diagnosis:
can be confirmed by virus isolation from blood in the first 4 days of
illness or by detection of specific IgM. The WHO will advise on
availability of laboratory diagnostic services.

Management:

there is no specific anti-viral therapy and treatment is supportive.
Direct human to human transmission, without the agency of a
mosquito vector, has not been reported. The case fatality rate is not
accurately known — perhaps 20% of patients with jaundice will die.

Prevention:
Immunization is the cornerstone of prevention — protective immunity
is probably lifelong after a single dose of live-attenuated vaccine.
Universal immunization in endemic areas would be effective but has
not been achieved. The disease is statutorily notifiable to the WHO. In
the event of human infection, measures should be taken to prevent or
control an outbreak in order to protect public health — see box.

Fig. 18.15 Distribution of yellow fever (the WHO). The dark grey
areas indicate countries that have reported at least one outbreak
of YF 1985-99 and the light grey countries are at risk of YF in the
future. (Reproduced from the WHO Report on Global Surveillance
of Epiidemic-prone Infectious Diseases with permission of the

WHO.)

Public health note
Prevention and control of a yellow fever
outbreak
Management of human cases
1. Notify the WHO (required under international
health regulations).
2. Prevent access of mosquitoes to patient for at least
5 days by screening room, spraying with
permethrin, lambda cyalothrin or DDT, and using
insecticide-treated bednets.
3. Spray patient's home and all nearby houses with
insecticide.
4. Identify areas visited by patient 3-6 days before
onset (e.g. place of work) and spray with
insecticide as appropriate.
5. Immunize family, contacts, and neighbours (if not
previously immunized).
Epidemic measures
Urban yellow fever
1. Mass immunization.
2. Eliminate and/or treat Aedes breeding sites.
3. Widespread insecticide spraying inside houses
should be considered.
Jungle yellow fever
1. Immunize all people living near or entering forested
area that is presumed focus.

2. Ensure non-immunized or just immunized (within 1
week) individuals avoid tracts of forest where
infection has been localized.

Chikungunya
Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that has a wide
geographical range — sub-Saharan Africa, India, Indian Ocean islands,
much of S.E. Asia — and can cause explosive outbreaks of disease. The
illness begins abruptly 4-7 days after the bite of an infected Aedes
mosquito. Common features are fever, chills, headache, photophobia,
vomiting, lymphadenopathy, and a predominantly truncal rash that
appears on the 2nd to 5th day of onset. Minor haemorrhagic phenomena
can oocur. A striking feature is myalgia and severe arthralgia/arthritis
affecting single or multiple joints. The strain responsible for the recent
Indian Ocean islands outbreak may be more virulent — there have
been confirmed cases of meningoencephalitis in neonates and the
elderly, and Chikungunya infection was associated with death in
elderly patients with co-morbidity.

Diagnosis:
is made by IgM-capture ELISA. PCR is useful for diagnosis with acute
samples.

Treatment:
is symptomatic. Recovery in 5-7 days without serious complications is
usual. Prolonged joint pain and stiffness may occur — 12% of patients
have chronic arthralgia 3 years after onset of illness.

Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF)

P.732

Overview:
Infections that cause haemorrhagic fever (HF) evoke great fear. The
term defines a clinical syndrome, not a specific cause. Viral

haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) occur in most parts of the world — see box.
Knowledge of local HF viruses is essential in assessing the risk to an
individual patient. Acute bacterial infections (especially
meningococcal disease, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection) and
falciparum malaria may produce a similar clinical picture and require
specific treatment.
The management of HF always includes general support. Infection
control measures to protect medical, nursing, and laboratory
personnel should be instituted until more information becomes
available. If a VHF that can be spread from person to person (in
particular, Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo HF, but also Lassa fever,
Bolivian HF, and Argentine HF) is plausible, based on time and place of
exposure, then local experts, the WHO, or CDC should be consulted
immediately to advise on infection control and to help expedite
diagnosis.
Viruses belonging to four different families of RNA viruses cause HF.

Clinical features:
VHF typically begins with a non-specific illness — fever, myalgia, and
malaise. Within a few days, the illness progresses with increasing
prostration, specific organ involvement, and evidence of vascular
damage (injected conjunctivae, oedema, organ dysfunction,
haemorrhage). Severe cases develop shock, CNS involvement, or
extensive bleeding.

Diagnosis:
The particular clinical features associated with different viruses are
listed on
p 735. but, in general, accurate diagnosis requires
virological confirmation in a specialist laboratory.

Management:
In addition to supportive therapy, antiviral therapy with ribavirin has
been shown to be effective in reducing mortality in severe cases of
Lassa fever. Ribavirin is probably also effective in other arenavirus

infections, Crimean-Congo HF, and HF with renal syndrome, if
administered early in the course of infection. If available, ribavirin
could also be considered for treatment of severe Rift Valley fever.

Management of VHF contacts and isolation
precautions
Determine index case's places of residence and activities over last 3
weeks, and search for unreported or undiagnosed cases.
Establish surveillance for individuals at risk — all close contacts
within 3 weeks of onset of illness and laboratory staff handling
specimens. Surveillance comprises body temperature measurement

twice daily until 3 weeks after last possible exposure. If oral
temperature exceeds 38.3°C, the contact should be hospitalized
immediately in strict isolation.
Reinforce and ensure the use of universal precautions in nonisolation areas of the health facility.
Isolate the VHF patient.
Wear protective clothing (enhanced by use of two sets of gloves, two
sets of clothing, plastic apron, boots, eyewear, bonnet, and mask) in
the isolation area, cleaning and laundry area, laboratory, or when in
contact with the patient. (Because of experimental infection of
primates by aerosols, the observed high mortality among health care
workers, and the desire to provide the maximum protection, masks
which meet the US HEPA or N series standards are recommended.)
Handle needles and other sharp instruments safely. Do not recap
needles. Dispose of non-reusable needles, syringes, and other sharp
patient-care instruments in puncture-resistant containers.
Avoid sharing equipment between patients. Designate equipment for
each patient, if supplies allow. If sharing equipment is unavoidable,
make sure it is not reused by another patient until it has been
cleaned, disinfected, and sterilized properly.
Disinfect all spills, equipment, and supplies safely. (This is enhanced
by using disinfectant sprayers and 0.05% hypochlorite solutions.)
Dispose of all contaminated waste by incineration or burial
(including safe disposal of corpse).
Provide appropriate information to the families and community
about the prevention of VHF and the care of infected patients.

(eds. Guerrant, Walker, and Weller)

Prevention of infection in the health care setting
Hospitals concentrate in one-place infectious patients, vulnerable
patients, invasive procedures, surgery, and resistant microbial flora.
Nosocomial infections are a large, under-recognized and preventable
problem in tropical hospitals and clinics, and risk of health careassociated infection in tropical and low-income countries is high:
In one Thai hospital studied 36% deaths were from nosocomial
infection.
Nosocomial infections were the 3rd most common infectious cause of
death in Mexico (after pneumonia and gastroenteritis).
In Ebola outbreaks, hospitals became foci of transmission to the
community at large.
There is a substantial risk of infection to both patients and health care
workers (HCWs) in these settings. Risk of nosocomial transmission of
certain infections is especially high in low-income settings e.g.
measles, gastrointestinal infections incl. typhoid and cholera, and TB.
Basic elements of hygiene and infection control are commonly
overlooked.

Minimum requirements
Gloves, disposable needles, and hand hygiene are absolute necessities
for any health service. Resources should not be wasted on ineffective
measures such as disinfecting floors or wearing of surgical masks by
HCWs on the wards.

Hand hygiene
Health care workers' hands are the main route of transmission for

many gastrointestinal, wound, and respiratory pathogens. This is
largely preventable by consistent hand cleansing. Provision of soap and
water near the bedside in every health facility is ideal, but not always
feasible. Re-use of towels decreases the efficacy of hand washing.
Alcohol-based hand cleansers are as effective as hand washing against
most pathogens, more convenient, and quicker to use and less
irritating to the hands. The basic ingredients (980 ml isopropyl alcohol
and 20 ml glycerine) are inexpensive. Routine hand cleansing between
patients should be practised — particularly by doctors, who often have
poor compliance with hand hygiene.

Mechanical barriers: gloves, etc.
Gloves are essential for all invasive procedures and any examination
involving exposure to body fluids. A face shield or goggles should be
used for procedures that may involve direct spraying (e.g. an arterial
spurter in surgery) or aerosolization of body fluids.

Enteric precautions and isolation
Patients who are incontinent with diarrhoea or who may have an
epidemic pathogen such as cholera, should be in a single room, if at all
possible. Gloves should be worn when examining the patient or
handling contaminated materials. Contaminated areas should be
cleaned with hot soapy water and equipment, with a disinfectant.

Respiratory isolation (includes TB, measles,
varicella)
Many respiratory pathogens, from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to
SARS, are present in large droplets which are transmitted over short
distances or by hand contact. TB, measles, and varicella are
transmitted by small aerosolized particles which travel much farther.
HCWs and patients are exposed to a significant risk of nosocomial TB
infection; especially vulnerable are HIV-infected individuals. Much of
the risk occurs before the diagnosis is made and treatment initiated
i.e. in casualty and medical wards. Ideally, TB suspects should be

identified and isolated when first seen; however, TB is in the
differential diagnosis of at least half of new medical admissions, which
may make it impossible to isolate all TB suspects.
Priority should be given to patients with possible drug resistant TB
(e.g. treatment failures).
Separate immune suppressed patients and small children from those
with suspected TB.
Ventilation and sunlight should be high priorities in the design and
operation of all health facilities in low-income countries.
Standard surgical masks worn by HCWs provide little if any
protection against TB. When worn by infectious patients e.g. going
down to the X-ray suite, they may ↓ dissemination of aerosolized
organisms. High-efficiency masks are expensive and require a good
fit to be effective.
TB culture laboratories, but not those doing smear microscopy, carry
an increased risk of TB exposure and should be equipped with
protective hoods and adequate ventilation.
HIV-infected HCWs should be encouraged to work in settings where
the risk of TB transmission is less e.g. non-clinical roles or
paediatrics.

Sterilization and disposal
The highest priority is to ensure that needles cannot be re-used in
the community.
Standard sterilization equipment should be used for surgical and
other hospital equipment and protocols for their use and
maintenance followed strictly.
Every health care facility should have a provision for the disposal or
incineration of medical waste.

Needle and sharps risk
In the tropics, the risk of nosocomial blood-borne infection is high.

Injections are often given under risky conditions, by ‘informal’ or
‘alternative’ health care providers in many communities. Both HCWs
and patients are at risk. Agents transmissible by this route include HIV,
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HTLV 1, syphilis, malaria, and dengue. Most
patients with blood-borne infections cannot be identified by history or
clinical findings. Routine testing of patients for HIV and other bloodborne infections has many benefits but contributes little to the
protection of HCWs. The best preventative strategy is the routine
application of ‘universal’ ‘or ‘standard’ precautions to all patients, in
all settings. This applies particularly to handling of needles and other
sharps, but also to the use of gloves when
there is any possibility of exposure to blood or body fluids. Consistent
application of these principles dramatically reduces the risk of
occupational infection among HCWs.
Every HCW using a needle for any procedure should have a punctureproof container at the bedside before starting the procedure, and
use it for disposal rather than recapping the needle.
Non-reusable needle systems are a more costly alternative.
Every HCW in contact with patients or specimens should be
vaccinated against hepatitis B (unless shown to have hepatitis B
surface antigen or antibody).
Only use injectable drugs when there is a clear therapeutic advantage
— ignore the preference for injections among some patients.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
When sharps injuries occur, post-exposure prophylaxis can reduce the
risk of HIV infection by over 80%. Every health care facility should
have: a) a protocol for sharps injuries and b) rapid access to initial
doses of antiretroviral drugs for PEP.
Action in sharps injury or blood exposures:
‘First aid’ — cleaning and irrigation of the wound or exposed area.
Assessment of the level of risk involved e.g. penetrating injury,
hollow bore or solid needle (the former is much higher risk),

exposure of mucous membranes or non-intact skin to blood or body
fluids.
Determine the HIV status of the source patient. This commonly
involves some delay if the patient's HIV status is not already known,
and it is often necessary to start PEP while waiting for the result.
Although there may be local differences of approach, source patients
should be informed and agree to HIV testing.
If a potentially risky exposure is thought to have occurred from an
HIV-infected source patient (or while awaiting source patient
results), PEP should be initiated immediately (within 1-2 h). Animal
models suggest that PEP efficacy correlates with the speed of
administration after the exposure.
If it proves impossible to determine the HIV status of the source
patient, a decision regarding PEP must be made on the likelihood of
the source patient having HIV.
Suggested PEP regimens vary, typically including at least two drugs
such as zidovudine and lamivudine. The standard duration is 28 days.
Nelfinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) is often used when threedrug therapy is recommended. Nevirapine should not be used in this
setting because of its high risk of serious reactions.
PEP recipients should be informed about possible adverse effects. If
the regimen involves zidovudine, a haemoglobin and white blood cell
count should be checked at about two weeks after PEP initiation, if
possible. HIV testing should be offered, usually at 0, 3, and 6 months
post exposure and safer sex practices recommended until a final
negative result is received. Follow-up for hepatitis B and C should be
carried out depending on source patient status, if local resources
permit.

Isolation for known or suspected viral
haemorrhagic fevers (VHF)
The critical element in the prevention of transmission from patients to
HCWs or other patients is the rigorous and consistent implementation
of ‘standard precautions’ as indicated above. External agencies such as

the CDC commonly become involved and may provide additional
resources and equipment such as high-efficiency masks which should be
worn if available. An infection control manual for VHFs in the African
health care setting is available at:

Mental Health

Introduction
Mental illnesses are a major public health problem, accounting for
12.7% of the global burden of disease. Projections indicate this will
increase. Common mental disorders (depression and anxiety), alcohol
use, and psychoses (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) are the leading
psychiatric causes of disability.
In most communities, mental illnesses are equated with psychoses.
Depression and anxiety and substance abuse, which account for most
mental morbidity, are seen as being social problems with physical
symptoms being the typical clinical presentations. Try to use locally
useful labels of illness, rather than emphasis on psychiatric diagnoses,
to improve the recognition of mental disorders and improve patient
compliance. Mental illnesses are more common in people with physical
illnesses, particularly chronic conditions, and may complicate the
treatment of physical disorders: e.g. mothers with depression are more
likely to have low birth weight babies and their infants are more likely
to be malnourished. People with HIV/AIDS have a higher rate of mental
disorders, which may interfere with their HIV care. Mental disorders
are associated with higher mortality, through suicide, physical disease
(e.g. liver damage from alcohol abuse), and worsening of the outcome
of co-morbid physical health problems.

Most mental disorders can be treated effectively using cheap and
relatively simple interventions, delivered by 1° or community health
care workers. Yet most mental disorders are not recognized by health
workers and treated inappropriately or not treated at all. Lack of
knowledge, fear about not being skilled to provide treatment, not
having enough time, and the stigma attached to mental disorders
(particularly psychoses) are major obstacles to meeting the mental
health needs of people.

Terms for mental illness
The terms used to detect mental disorders are heavily influenced by
language. For example, if very few patients complain of ‘depression’,
then the term ‘depression’ as a diagnosis has limited meaning for
doctors or patients. However, in all languages, one can find locally
meaningful words to describe emotional and behavioural states that
doctors may diagnose as a mental disorder. Find out what the most
appropriate words are for the descriptions in the box opposite and use
these to help communicate with your patients and other health
workers more effectively.

Terms for mental illness — making sense of mental illness
An illness where the person thinks too much, cannot sleep, and is
tired all the time (probable diagnosis: common mental disorders =
anxiety and depression).
An illness where the person gets very scared or frightened for no
reason (probable diagnosis: panic disorder or PTSD).
An illness where the person behaves in a strange way, says strange
things, holds strange beliefs (diagnosis: severe mental disorders =
psychoses).
An illness where the person drinks too much alcohol or uses drugs.
An illnesses in which a child does not learn as well as others in
school.

Suicide and deliberate self-harm

Deliberate self-harm may take many forms e.g. deliberate overdosing
with medication, self-poisoning with pesticides, self-cutting, hanging,
or burning. The motivations can vary widely and several may play a
role simultaneously. There are large variations between countries in
the rates and methods used depending on socio-cultural, economic,
and political conditions. In many cases, the patient may be suffering
from a mental illness, typically depression or alcohol use, or a chronic
physical illness (such as HIV/AIDS). Major risk factors are: social
factors, particularly financial difficulties and gender-based violence,
and, in young people, educational pressures and conflict with parents
or partners. The lethality of suicide attempts varies considerably
between sexes and populations, both due to the method used and the
availability and access to emergency medical care.
Consider suicide risk in all patients with mental illnesses. Patients are
rarely embarrassed, and often very relieved, to be tactfully asked
about suicide. Asking about suicidal thoughts does not ↑ risk for
suicide. Simple questions you might ask are:
‘Feeling as you've described recently, have you felt that life was a
struggle? Have you felt as if there was no point in living anymore?’
‘Patients with similar difficulties to you sometimes tell me they feel
like ending their life. Have you felt like that?’

Management
Ensure that the patient is out of immediate danger. 1st treat the
medical consequences of the suicide attempt.
Suicide is a sensitive and personal matter. Talk to the patient in
private. Give the patient enough time to feel comfortable and share
their reasons frankly.
Do not make judgements about the patient's character; do not make
reassuring statements without fully understanding the patient's
situation because this may make the patient feel even more
hopeless.
Talk to family or friends for their version of the patient's recent life

situation and health.
Assess mental state (common mental disorders, alcohol or drug
dependency, and psychotic disorders) and offer appropriate
treatment.
Help the patient address the main problems. These may be
psychological, social (e.g. financial problems, relationship
difficulties), or physical (e.g. chronic illness); see box on
p 745.
Enlist the help of others (e.g. relatives or friends, social workers,
counsellors), with the consent of the patient.
Ensure you give a follow-up appointment within 2 weeks.
Assess future suicide risk. It may be necessary to agree to remove
dangerous/sharp objects from the patient's home, and even to
ensure constant supervision by relatives if you feel the risk for
suicide is high.

Assessment of future suicide risk
Intention of act: what was their motivation? Ask about associated
actions and thoughts; go through what led up to the act and
afterwards. Was there planning/preparation?
Method chosen: how lethal or dangerous was the method chosen?
Why did they choose this method, and did they consider
alternatives? Did they make any ‘final acts’ (e.g. writing a suicide
note)? Did they take precautions to avoid discovery?
What did the act represent: a wish to die/for help/something else?
Did they seek help or tell anyone? Was medical attention willingly
sought or were they coerced?
Present feelings and intentions: do they regret or feel guilty about
the act or being discovered? Have they changed how they feel? If
they go home, will they cope? What do they want now: to die or
get help? Will they accept treatment?
Precipitation: what problems led to the act? Are these likely to
recur or persist? What can be done about them?
Resources: what resources are available

(self/friends/family/community/health services)? Is the patient
isolated? How can this be addressed?
Mental disorder: is the patient severely depressed or psychotic?
Will she/he take treatment?
Protective factors: do they have hope for future improvement? Do
they have supportive children/partner/family/friends or strong
convictions or religious beliefs that would prevent them from
committing suicide?
Personal history: previous attempts, chronic pain or illness, social
isolation, unemployment, and older age (all ↑ risk of eventual
suicide).

Common mental disorders
Common mental disorders are depressive and anxiety disorders, most
often seen in 1° care. Though psychiatric classifications deal with
depressive disorders and anxiety disorders separately, many patients
have symptoms of both disorders, both have similar risk factors, and
both respond to the similar treatments. Hence the broader term of
‘common mental disorders’ is often used when describing the
practical, clinical approach to these disorders.
Common mental disorders are amongst the most important causes of
morbidity and are the leading mental health cause of disability
worldwide. However, these disorders are often missed, because few
patients complain of psychological symptoms. Moreover, there is a
tendency to prescribe benzodiazepines or placebo treatments when
specific and efficacious treatments exist: antidepressants and brief
psychological treatment.

Clinical features
Although the terms ‘depression’ and ‘anxiety’ imply a sad mood or
feeling fearful, few patients complain of emotional or cognitive
(thinking) symptoms. Patients classically have physical complaints. On
inquiry, you can readily elicit emotional and cognitive symptoms.
Sometimes, relatives may misinterpret these symptoms as signs of

laziness. In some individuals, severe symptoms of anxiety may
dominate in the form of panic attacks and phobias (see below). Panic
attacks may present as an emergency e.g. with acute chest pain.

Diagnosis
Anxiety and depression are normal human experiences in certain
situations e.g. to feel miserable when a relative dies, or a medical
student before an examination will feel anxious and tense. Depression
and anxiety become an illness if lasting >2 weeks, interfering with
daily life, or causing severe symptoms. Suspect a common mental
disorder when physical complaints do not fit into the pattern of
common physical illnesses. Remember that common mental disorders
are more frequent in persons with chronic physical health problems;
always assess depression and anxiety in such patients. Other risk
groups are persons using drugs or alcohol, tobacco users, women, and
people facing severe economic or social difficulties.
In all patients, inquire about drug and alcohol misuse (alcohol/drugs
may be used to self-treat anxiety, or anxiety and depression may be
the consequence of dependence). Rarely, anxiety and depression may
be the presenting symptoms of another medical disorder e.g.
hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, Cushing' syndrome.

Clinical features of depression
Presenting complaints
tiredness, fatigue, and weakness.
vague aches and pains all over the body.
disturbed sleep (usually worse, but occasionally too much sleep).
poor appetite (sometimes ↑ appetite).

Complaints on inquiry
feeling sad and miserable.
feeling a loss of interest in life, social interactions, work, etc.
feeling guilty.
feeling hopeless about the future.

difficulty making decisions.
thoughts that one is not as good as others (low self-esteem).
thoughts that it would be better if one was not alive.
suicidal ideas and plans.
difficulty in concentrating.

Clinical features of anxiety
Presenting complaints
palpitations.
a feeling of suffocation.
chest pain.
dizziness.
trembling, shaking all over.
headaches.
pins and needles (or sensation of ants crawling) on limbs or face.
poor sleep.

Complaints on inquiry
feeling as if something terrible is going to happen.
feeling scared.
worrying too much about one's problems or one's health.
thoughts that one is going to die, lose control, or go mad.

Common management principles
Use a stepped care approach i.e. give advice to all patients and
reserve medication or psychological treatment for those who do not
recover or are extremely depressed (e.g. actively suicidal). Advice
should emphasize the link between thoughts, feelings, and physical
responses e.g. reminding the patient about physical sensations when
they are very scared. Explain how stress can lead to health
problems, including physical complaints.

After confirming diagnosis, assess suicide risk (see
p 745): there is
no evidence that asking about suicide ‘puts ideas into their head’.
Reassure families and the patient that simply because there are no
physical signs or diagnoses, this does not mean the patient is
‘making it up’.
Avoid unnecessary medical investigations and placebo treatments.
Identify and ↓ stimulants that predispose to anxiety (e.g. cigarettes,
steroids, chewing khat (Catha edulis), alcohol).
Identify and discuss ways of ↓ work pressures, disabilities, or conflict
at home. Speak with the spouse or relatives.
Encourage the patient to stop concentrating on negative ideas or
acting on them (e.g. leaving work).
Avoid the ‘pull yourself together’ or ‘there is nothing wrong with
you’ approach — the patients are caught up in guilt and feelings of
failure and do not need outside blame.
A problem-solving approach may be useful, focusing on small,
defined steps (see box).
Medication is useful for moderate and severe depressive episodes
with 70-80% patients showing an improvement. (see box).
If patient does not respond: review diagnosis, ensure complaince
with medication, ↑ dose to the maximum permitted dose, consider
referral to other agencies for social issues, and consider changing
medication to an alternative class.

Psychological treatments for common mental disorders
Anxiety reduction techniques
These techniques need to be practised, ideally daily, to develop the
ability to relax before and during stressful situations.
Progressive muscle relaxation: in a quiet environment, close eyes,
tensing then relaxing muscles, starting from feet, then legs, then
thighs, etc, up to the head. Concentrate on the relaxed feelings.
Controlled breathing: close eyes; breathe in and out to a slow

count of 4 or 5. Continue for 5 mins. The patient can chant in his
mind a religious or calming word while exhaling.
Imagery: visualize a scene that is calm, safe, and relaxing.
Concentrate on the details — smells, sounds, and feel of the
place.
Distraction: focus attention away from anxious thoughts and
sensations and on to something relaxing and absorbing.

Problem solving
Common mental disorders are often the consequence of practical
problems the patient is facing in their daily lives. Unfortunately, the
disorders impair the ability of the patient to take the steps
necessary to overcome their problems. Problem solving aims to
empower the patient to regain control over their lives.
Explain the treatment.
Define the problems (what are the different problems faced by
the patient).
Summarize the problems (how are these problems related to the
patient's symptoms).
Select one problem and choose the goals (why should the patient
overcome the problem).
Define solutions (the action to be taken to overcome the
problem).
Review the outcome of the actions taken (did it make the
problem less; did it help improve the patient's mood).

Group therapy
In many places, people are accustomed to meet in groups to discuss
personal problems. For example, women may meet regularly to
discuss their health or social condition. Similar groups may be used
for patients with common mental disorders. Discussion about
symptoms, their causes, and how individuals cope with their
problems, helps each group member in their recovery.

Specific presentations of common mental

disorders
Recurrent depression
Some patients suffer from repeated episodes of depression. Consider
long-term follow up, (e.g. once a month) to discuss personal and social
issues, and continue antidepressants for 2 yrs or more. Consider a longterm prophylactic medication (e.g. lithium or sodium valproate).

Phobic disorder
A phobia is a fear of a specific situation that is out of proportion to the
objective risks, beyond voluntary control, and not responsive to
reasoning. It results in avoidance of situations in which the trigger
might occur (e.g. crowds, open spaces, travelling, social events).
Patients may become confined to their house. Phobias can be managed
by anxiety reduction techniques (see box). Use graded exposure (e.g.
to feared situation such as crowds) to ↓ avoidance and escape the
cycle of reinforcement. Antidepressants may also be effective.

Panic disorder
Recurrent, frequent, unexpected panic attacks in which the patient
experiences severe, acute anxiety accompanied by chest pain,
breathlessness, or dizziness that are typically the result of
hyperventilation. Panic attacks are best managed using anxiety
reduction techniques. Antidepressants are also effective and
anxiolytics can be used for short-term relief.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder
Obsessional thoughts are recurrent thoughts, ideas, or images that are
distressing to the patient who makes efforts (often unsuccessful) to get
rid of them e.g. thoughts of being dirty or blasphemous or ugly.
Compulsions are behaviours that are repeated (e.g. cleaning or
counting rituals) even though the patient recognizes that this is
irrational, but is unable to resist the urge to carry them out. This
disorder is managed using psychological treatments (e.g. cognitive

behavioural techniques) or antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine,
clomipramine).

Medicines for common mental disorders
Antidepressants
Antidepressants are the most effective medications, irrespective of
the types of symptoms the patient presents with. There are two
major classes of antidepressants.
Tricyclic antidepressants e.g. imipramine or amitryptiline initially
25 to 50 mg PO at night. Minimum effective dose is 75 mg; max
daily dose 150 mg, given as a single night-time dose.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors e.g. fluoxetine, initially 20
mg PO od (also the minimum effective dose), max daily dose 60
mg given as a single dose in the morning.
Choice of antidepressant is influenced by:
Toxicity (if risk of overdose is high, avoid tricyclics).
Side-effect profile (avoid amitryptiline and imipramine in patients
with heart disease).
Symptoms: consider more sedative medication (e.g. amitryptiline,
imipramine) in anxious or sleep-deprived patients.
Regimen is as follows:
Start at a low dose and ↑gradually over a few weeks to the
minimum effective dose, with regular reviews to assess sideeffects, compliance, and suicidal ideation.
Explain that side-effects generally fade after 2-3 weeks and that
maximum benefit builds up over 3-6 weeks, provided medication
is taken every day.
Once improved, continue the antidepressant for >6 mths, to
minimize the risk of relapse.
Withdraw medication gradually to avoid discontinuation
syndromes.

Benzodiazepines or other medicines
Anxiolytics (e.g. diazepam 2 mg PO tds, ↑as necessary to 5-10 mg

tds) are effective for short-term (<2 weeks) acute relief of severe
anxiety symptoms. Dependence and reinforcement of anxiety may
occur with longer use.
Beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol 40 mg PO bd or tds) are effective
in ↓ autonomic symptoms (e.g. palpitations and tremor).

Severe mental disorders (psychoses)
This group consists of schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychoses (also
called bipolar disorder), and brief or acute psychoses. These illnesses
are relatively rare. They are characterized by marked behavioural
problems and strange or unusual thinking. The majority of patients of
all cultures in psychiatric hospitals suffer from psychoses.

Clinical features
Delusions: false beliefs, not in keeping with the patient's cultural or
educational background: e.g. the body or mind are under external
control, or that thoughts are being inserted, withdrawn, or
broadcast from their mind, or persecutory or grandiose delusions, or
other very bizarre beliefs.
Hallucinations: the experience of their thoughts being spoken aloud,
or other persistent auditory, visual, olfactory, or somatic
hallucinations.
Thought disorder: inability to communicate coherently, with thinking
and speech becoming illogical and irrelevant.
Disturbed behaviour: both aggressive or agitated; withdrawn or
apathetic behaviour may be seen.
Insight (the awareness of being ill and needing treatment) is often
seriously impaired.
The three psychoses are distinguished through the following criteria:
Duration of symptoms: if symptoms have occurred for the 1st time
<1 mo before, then the most likely diagnosis is acute or brief
psychosis.

Affective/mood symptoms: if there are marked depressive or manic
features, the most likely diagnosis is bipolar disorder.
Cognitive impairment e.g. disorientation: indicates the probability
of acute psychoses (e.g. organic psychosis or delirium).
Chronicity: if symptoms have been continually evident for >6 mths,
the likely diagnosis is schizophrenia.
Episodic course: with periods of relatively normal health in between,
is typical of bipolar disorder.
Presence of a trigger: although any of the psychoses may be
precipitated by a trigger, these are the hallmark of acute or brief
psychoses.

Schizophrenia
A severe mental disorder which usually begins before the age of 30.
Apart from the usual symptoms of psychoses, patients may also show
catatonic behaviour (stupor, mutism, posturing), negative symptoms
(unexplained apathy, not speaking, incongruous affect), and marked
social withdrawal. Schizophrenia is often a long-term illness which
may last months — years and may require long-term treatment.
There is often a family history of mental illness.

Manic depressive illness or bipolar disorder
A chronic psychosis characterized by episodes of ‘high’ mood or
mania and ‘low’ mood or depression. Usually begins in adulthood
and generally is diagnosed because of the manic phase,
characterized by agitation, inappropriate behaviour (e.g. spending
money excessively or sexually inappropriate behaviour), ↓sleep,
↑levels of energy, irritability, suspiciousness, rapid thinking and
speech, and grandiose delusions (e.g. believing one has special
powers). The depressed phase is similar to depression in common
mental disorders except that it is usually more serious. A typical
feature of this condition is that it is episodic. There are periods,
from months — years, when the person is completely well, even if
they are not taking treatment. There is often a family history of
mental illness. Bipolar disorder diagnosis requires ≥1 manic episode.

Differential diagnosis of manic episodes includes alcohol or drug
misuse and acute psychoses.

Acute or brief psychoses
Usually start suddenly and are characterized by florid or marked
psychotic symptoms. Most patients recover completely within a
month and do not need long-term treatment. Typically caused by a
sudden severe stressful event e.g. the death of a loved person, or
may be induced by amphetamines or cannabis or by a severe
medical or brain illness; when this happens, the condition is also
called a ‘delirium’. Delirium needs urgent medical treatment. The
presence of fever, other signs of a physical illness, disorientation
and altered consciousness, and history of head injury should raise
the suspicion of delirium. Sometimes, an acute psychotic episode
may be the presenting event heralding a schizophrenic illness.

Management of severe mental disorders
Treatment should be started as soon as possible since untreated
psychosis is linked with ↑disability.
Acutely disturbed patients, especially those with acute manic
episodes, may need to be admitted to hospital and require intensive
nursing. If this is not available, try to arrange a safe environment.
Respect the patient's rights and dignity, irrespective of how
disturbed she/he may be. Avoid confrontation/argument and where
it is necessary to intervene, do it calmly and firmly.
Minimize the risk of harm to the patient with behavioural
disturbance and others. Promote a calm, relaxed atmosphere and
minimize stress.
Agitation and/or psychotic symptoms should be treated with an
antipsychotic medication; if these are not sufficient, then sedative
medication (benzodiazepines) may be required for short periods.
Treat with antipsychotic medication — see box,

p 756.

If there is no or incomplete response: ↑dose.
Assess compliance; discuss reasons for non-compliance (e.g. poor
insight, intolerable side-effects) and address these reasons (e.g.
switch antipsychotic drug to an alternative with fewer side-effects).
Family intervention: discuss the illness with supportive family
members, and counsel them to ↓levels of stress and hostility in the
family. A sympathetic explanation that the patient is suffering from
an illness that can be treated may help allay fears about the cause
and implications of the illness. In particular, advise that
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder need long-term treatment.
Once the patient has recovered from acute symptoms, offer
sheltered work or appropriate training to help develop occupational
and self-care skills.
Activity or distraction may ↓ severity or burden of symptoms, such
as hallucinations.
Counsel the patient regarding cessation of substance abuse,
especially cannabis which can exacerbate psychoses.
Mood stabilizers are indicated for patients with chronic affective
disorders (bipolar disorder). They are only effective if patient
complies for >6 mths — these must be taken for >2 yrs (see box).
Develop a therapeutic relationship with the patient and invite the
patient for regular reviews to assess mental health and provide
medication.

Antipsychotic drugs for severe mental
disorders

P.756

Antipsychotic drugs can be conveniently grouped into:
Conventional drugs including chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, and
haloperidol. These drugs are older and generic (and thus cheap), but
are associated with more extrapyramidal and anticholinergic sideeffects.
Atypical drugs: these include risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine.

These are newer, more expensive (while still patented), and
associated with less extrapyramidal and anticholinergic side-effects
(although clozapine is associated with potentially serious bonemarrow suppressive side-effects).
Depot medication: these are long-acting, injectable formulations of
drugs (conventional or atypical) e.g. flupenthixol decanoate and
haloperidol decanoate.

Starting dose
Drug-naïve patients should be started on a low dose and this dose
increased based on clinical response (e.g. haloperidol 1.5-3 mg PO bd
(3-5 mg bd if severe), increased up to a maximum of 15 mg bd; or
risperidone 2 mg nocte (4 mg nocte if severe), increased if necessary
up to a maximum of 8 mg nocte). Benefit should become apparent
within 2 weeks and continued improvement occurs for 3-6 months.

Length of treatment
For acute psychoses and affective psychoses, antipsychotic drugs may
be gradually reduced after the patient has been well for >3 mths. For
schizophrenia, the medication may need to be continued for longer
periods, sometimes for many years. Depot medication may be
especially useful for these patients; a test dose of a depot must always
be administered the first time these drugs are being used.

Issues with treatment of schizophrenia
Most patients with schizophrenia will respond to an antipsychotic;
however, the majority will relapse within 2 yrs if they stop medication.
~25% of patients do not respond adequately, despite being compliant.
They should be switched to an alternative drug, ideally from a
different class. Patients who remain psychotic despite adequate trials
of antipsychotics are often termed ‘treatment resistant’. The diagnosis
should be reviewed. Where the diagnosis is schizophrenia, a trial of
clozapine is warranted (2/3 will respond to clozapine). Withdraw other
antipsychotics and commence clozapine 12.5 mg PO od or bd initially,
gradually titrated up to 300 mg (max 900 mg) over 2-3 weeks in 25-50

mg increments. Monitor FBC weekly for 4 months initially, and monthly
thereafter (causes agranulocytosis).

Side-effects of antipsychotic medication
Warn the patient about likely side-effects: acute and chronic
movement disorders and anticholinergic effects for conventional
drugs, ↑appetite and weight, sedation, and hyperprolactinaemia
(gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, dysmennorrhea, and sexual
dysfunction).
Movement disorders include:
Acute dystonia (e.g. painful ocular deviation, neck twisting, or
muscle spasms) may occur within hours.
Parkinsonism: tremors and rigidity.
Akathisia: severe motor restlessness.
Movement disorders should be managed by:
↓ dose.
Switching from a conventional to atypical antipsychotic.
Acute dystonias should be treated with an anticholinergic such as
procyclidine 5-10 mg IM, which can be repeated after 20 mins.
Parkinsonism may be treated with an anticholinergic (e.g.
procyclidine. 2.5 mg PO tds, increasing gradually up to max 30 mg
in divided doses).
Akathisia can be managed with a benzodiazepine.

Mood stabilizers
These are drugs used to prevent episodes of mania or depression in
people with recurrent depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. The
most effective are lithium and sodium valproate. Both must be
taken regularly and require monitoring, especially lithium.
Lithium carbonate — start with 400 mg od. Adjust dose (sometimes
to >1 g/day) to achieve a serum lithium concentration of 0.4-1
mmol/L 12 h after a dose 4-7 days after starting treatment. Warn
patients about signs of toxicity: coarse tremor, nausea, diarrhoea,

confusion, fits. Blood levels should be measured weekly until
stable, and then at least 6 monthly.
Sodium valproate is an effective mood stabilizer and has the
advantage of being effective for epilepsy, being less toxic in
overdose, and requiring less blood monitoring. Start with 750 mg
daily in 2-3 divided doses and ↑ according to clinical response (or
blood levels of 50-75 mg/L) up to 1-2 g/day in divided doses.

Mental retardation (learning disability)
Mental retardation (MR) is not a mental illness in the strict sense of
the word. The mental abilities of the child are slower or delayed
compared to other children. There is impairment in cognitive, social,
language, and motor development, with onset during childhood. The
prevalence of moderate to severe retardation varies from 1-20/1000
worldwide. Persons with mental retardation are often brought to
health workers by concerned family members for many reasons such as
self-care, school difficulties, and behavioural problems such as
aggression.

Clinical features
Delays in achieving milestones e.g. sitting, walking, speaking.
Difficulties in school e.g. coping with studies and repeated failure.
Difficulties in relating to others, especially other children of same
age.
In adolescents, inappropriate sexual behaviour.
In adults, problems in everyday activities e.g. cooking, managing
money, finding and staying on in a job.
There are degrees of mental retardation:
Mild retardation may lead only to difficulty in schooling but no other
problems.
Moderate retardation may lead to failure to stay in the school

system and difficulties in self-care such as bathing.
Severe retardation often means the person needs help even for
simple activities such as feeding.
Whereas persons with mild retardation may spend their entire lives
without being ‘detected’, those at the severe end are diagnosed in
early childhood because of the obvious severity of the disability.
People with mild retardation may be able to live alone and work in
certain jobs; however, severe affected people will almost always need
close supervision and care.

Assessment
An informant such as a parent is essential.
Record nature and extent of mental retardation — take a
developmental history and consider delay in communication and
social interaction; motor function and self-care; and functional
academic skills.
Identify additional problems — such as self-harm or harm to others;
impulsive or dangerous behaviour.
Determine aetiology — see box opposite. In most cases, however, no
definite aetiology will be identifiable.
Identify co-existing psychiatric diagnoses — prevalence is 2-4-fold
higher in people with mental retardation than the general
population.

Causes of moderate to severe mental retardation
Prenatal (50-70%)
Genetic e.g. Fragile X; Down's syndrome.
Congenital infections with HSV 2, rubella, HIV, toxoplasmosis,
syphilis, CMV.
Exposure to toxins such as alcohol.
Maternal disorder such as pre-eclampsia.

Perinatal (10-20%)

— low birth weight, extreme prematurity, delivery problems
resulting in asphyxia or brain trauma, neonatal sepsis, encephalitis,
kernicterus.

Postnatal (5-10%)
— brain damage due to trauma, infections, toxic agents (e.g. lead
poisoning), iodine deficiency, malnutrition.

Management
1st be certain that the child has MR. MR implies that the child has a
an incurable problem. It is a label which can cause great
unhappiness, so use it with care. If in doubt, get a 2nd opinion from a
child or mental health specialist.
Once you are confident that the child has MR, determine its severity.
The abilities a child has will be an important indicator of how much
progress the child is likely to make in the years ahead.
If the child has a specific medical problem e.g. low thyroid function,
sensory impairment, or seizures, treat these. Other than these rare
situations, there are no indications for using medicines to treat MR.
Do not use ‘brain tonics’ and other medicines supposed to help
‘mental function’. Use antipsychotics or antidepressants to treat
psychoses or common mental disorders in people with MR.
Reassure the family that, even though the child has limited mental
abilities, he will achieve many milestones in life. They must be
prepared to accept a delay in these milestones and be realistic in
what they expect their child to achieve. Explain that there is no
cure and that they should not waste money on false claims of cures.
Teach the parents how to help the child in daily activities e.g. in
toileting and feeding, by breaking down activities into smaller bits.
Use reward and praise whenever the child succeeds in any activity,
however small. Find activities which can help the parent spend time
with the child and yet allow other household activities to be done
e.g. the child could learn to help the mother in daily chores in the
house.

Never ignore the child's educational needs. Some parents feel like
giving up on the child's education when they discover that the child
has MR. Stress to the parents their child needs education just as any
other child. Refer the family to local schools for children with
special needs.
Provide information about any special schemes to help families with
children with MR either through financial or educational help.
Stay in regular touch with the family. Some families go through a lot
of stress because of caring for a child with MR, especially when the
MR is severe. Caring can itself be a cause of stress and mental health
problems. Refer parents to support groups.

Disorders due to substance abuse
The most common substances of abuse/dependence are alcohol and
tobacco. Others include: glue or benzene (which is inhaled); heroin;
cocaine; amphetamines; cannabis; benzodiazepines. The origin of
benzodiazepine abuse is often iatrogenic.
Alcohol and drug abuse is rarely the main reason for seeking health
care. Instead, the health worker has to be alert to the possibility of
substance abuse (e.g. repeated unexplained injuries or absence from
work). Many patients with substance abuse problems also develop
other mental disorders, particularly, common mental disorders. Suicide
is more common, and psychoses can occur both during intoxicated and
withdrawal states.

Dependence
A person is said to be dependent on alcohol or drugs when their use
harms the person's physical, mental, or social health. The diagnosis of
a dependence syndrome should be made if ≥3 of the following are
present:
Strong desire/compulsion to take the substance.
Difficulties controlling substance-taking behaviour in terms of onset,
termination, or levels of use.

Withdrawal: a physiological state when use of the substance has
been stopped or reduced. The patient may use the substance to
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.
Tolerance: ↑ doses are required to achieve a given effect.
Neglect of alternative interests: obtaining and taking the substance
gradually grows to dominate the individual's life.
Continued use despite evidence of harmful consequences: the user
must be aware of these consequences.
Dependence problems lead to great damage to individuals, their
families, and to the community. For example, alcohol not only harms
the drinker due to its physical effects, but also is associated with high
suicide rates, marriage problems and domestic violence, road traffic
crashes, and poverty.
Harmful use is substance abuse not fulfilling the above criteria but
causing significant damage to mental or physical health. There are
often major social consequences.

Management of dependence
There is increasing evidence that dependent patients have ↓ ability to
control substance use — it is not just ‘a lack of willpower’. Ask ‘open’
questions and use ‘reflective listening’, clarify concerns, convey
empathy and collaboration, and motivate patients to reach their own
conclusions about the effects of substance misuse.
Advise the patient that dependence is an illness with serious health
effects, and stopping or ↓ use will bring mental and physical health,
social and economic benefits. Explain the symptoms of withdrawal.
Abstinence should be the goal in the majority of cases, although ↓
levels of use are sometimes appropriate.

Questions to assess alcohol abuse: the CAGE
questionnaire
Alcohol dependence is likely with 2 or more positive answers:
have you ever felt you should CUT down your drinking?

have people ANNOYED you by criticising your drinking?
have you ever felt bad or GUILTY about your drinking?
have you ever had a drink first think in the morning to steady
your nerves or get rid of a hangover (EYE-opener)?
For patients willing to stop now or control their use, help them:
Set a definite day to quit/begin controlled use.
Enlist the help of a friend or relative who is not using the substance
to be a buddy and help the person.
If ↓ use, agree a clear and specific goal for reduction (e.g. no more
than 4 units of alcohol/day and 2 alcohol-free days/week).
Agree strategies to control use (e.g. slow down drinking to <1
unit/hr, introduce alternative behaviour such as drinking fruit juice,
chewing gum, exercise).
Identify high-risk situations (social or stressful occasions) and
strategies to avoid or cope with these.
Make plans to avoid substances (e.g. develop assertiveness skills to
respond to friends who are using substances).
Discuss symptoms and management of withdrawal (see later).
Medicines may be available for withdrawal from opiates (e.g.
methadone) — these need specialist assessment and monitoring.
Minimize risk of harm due to substance abuse e.g. advise not to
drive after drinking, never to share needles, regarding safe sexual
practice.
Prevent iatrogenic abuse by using benzodiazepines cautiously, and
never for more than four weeks running.
If the attempt is unsuccessful:
Identify areas of success (e.g. cut down use for a period).
Discuss situations/triggers for relapse; can changes be made?
Try again.

If the attempt is successful
Consider the use of medicines used to ↓ risk of relapse (e.g.
disulfiram or acamprosate for alcohol dependence).
Relapse is common and often occurs because the person is not able
to deal with life difficulties. Once drug use is stopped, discuss ways
in which the person could cope. Identify different things a person
can do to ↓ risk of taking drugs such as: giving up friends who also
use drugs; getting back to work, school, other enjoyable activities;
learning relaxation and problem-solving; joining community groups
which help substance abusers (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous).

Withdrawal states
Many states show these general effects:
anxiety.
tremor.
fever.
sleep disturbance.
tachycardia.
gastro-intestinal disturbance.
In addition, the following symptoms may occur during withdrawal from
specific substances:
Opiate: hypertension, tachycardia, dysphoria, agitation, insomnia,
diarrhoea and vomiting, shivering, sweating, lacrimation,
rhinorrhoea, dilated pupils, piloerection (‘gooseflesh’), muscle
aches.
Alcohol: fits, confusional states including delirium tremens (severe
confusional state with visual and auditory hallucinations and
paranoid ideation); risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy
(ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and ataxia with confusion due to
thiamine deficiency).
Benzodiazepines/barbiturates: weight loss, vivid dreams (REM sleep

rebound), tinnitus, irritability, impaired memory and concentration,
perceptual disturbance (hypersensitivity to sound, light and touch,
derealization and depersonalization), confusional states, and fits.

Timing
Withdrawal states usually begin 4-12 h after the last dose, peak at 4872 h, and last 7-10 days. Benzodiazepine withdrawal begins later,
usually 1-14 days after the last dose and may last many months. The
confusional states and fits associated with alcohol, benzodiazepine,
and barbiturate withdrawal are potentially life-threatening.
Withdrawal states should be avoided as much as possible by using a
gradual reducing regime and being treated rapidly when identified.

Management
Opiate withdrawal
If there are clinical features of withdrawal, prescribe a single dose
of dihydrocodeine (e.g. 120 mg; alternative codeine). Reassess after
4 h, and prescribe another 120 mg. This can be repeated once more.
The patient should not receive more than 360 mg dihydrocodeine in
the first 12 h. After the initial 12 h, the dose can be increased to 480
mg over the next 24 h. Gradually d dose over 5-10 days.
Do not prescribe dihydrocodeine on an ‘as required’ basis. The
patient must be assessed before each dose in the early stages. Write
on the prescription — ‘do not give if drowsy, sedated, ataxic, with
slurred speech or asleep’. Do not give if the patient has been away
from the ward and you suspect illicit drug use; do not allow the
patient to leave the ward for 4 h after increasing the dose. Do not
give dihydrocodeine to patients on discharge.

Alcohol withdrawal
Admission may be advisable, particularly if there is a Hx of previous
severe withdrawals (e.g. confusion, fits), poor physical health (e.g.
liver failure), or mental health (e.g. suicidal ideation). A reducing
dose of a substitute benzodiazepine is given over 7-14 days e.g.
initial dose of chlordiazepoxide 10-50 mg PO qds.
Higher doses may be required. As an in-patient, this judgement

can be based on symptoms of withdrawal, with more frequent
dosing.
A short-acting drug (e.g. lorazepam 1 mg od or bd) may be used
instead for patients with significant liver failure.
B-complex vitamins should be given parenterally to prevent or
treat Wernicke's encephalopathy.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal
Most common with short-acting agents e.g. lorazepam. Change to an
equivalent dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam
(lorazepam 0.5 mg is equivalent to diazepam 5 mg). Then gradually
↓ dose every 2-3 weeks in steps of diazepam 2-2.5 mg. If withdrawal
symptoms occur, maintain the dose until symptoms improve.
Thereafter, ↓dose further, in smaller steps if necessary. If
dependency is chronic, this may take up to 12 weeks.

Adjustment disorders and bereavement
An adjustment disorder is a state of emotional disturbance and
impaired social functioning that develops shortly after (<3 months) or
during a stressor. There may be affective, cognitive, and behavioural
symptoms. Stressors may take many forms (e.g. bereavement,
diagnosis of a major illness such as HIV/AIDS, migration). Adjustment
disorders are common in people with physical disorders, and should be
considered if rehabilitation is slower or poorer than expected.

Bereavement:
may be abnormal in form and/or severity compared to cultural norms.
Four stages have been described:
Shock and numbness.
Preoccupation (yearning or anger, etc.).
Disorganization (loss is reluctantly accepted).
Resolution.
These may not necessarily occur in this order. Bereavement is

considered abnormal when symptoms are not related to the loss —
such as feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt. Abnormal
perceptions involving the lost person (e.g. hearing them whispering)
can be a feature of normal bereavement, but hallucinatory
phenomena not involving the lost person are indications of abnormal
(or pathological) bereavement.

Management
Allow the individual to talk about the loss and its circumstances, and
to discuss the feelings that are provoked, particularly guilt and
anger.
Involve the others in the family, and aim to ↑ social support.
Identify steps that can be taken to modify causes of stress.
Medication should be avoided unless there is depression or psychosis.
If there is severe insomnia, hypnotics may be used — but only for <2
weeks.

Post-traumatic stress disorder

P.766

An incident which makes a person fear for their life or causes extreme
distress is a traumatic event e.g. rape; war; major disasters. Many
persons affected by trauma will experience some emotional reaction.
These include a feeling of being numb or in a daze, scared, sleep
difficulties, repeated thoughts of the event, irritability, nightmares,
and poor concentration. This is a normal response to a traumatic
incident and lasts for a short period (~2-4 weeks). In a few people,
however, these experiences continue for months (even years) after the
trauma. They begin to interfere with the person's daily life and may
lead to new problems such as alcohol abuse or problems in
relationships with other people. This called post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD).

Clinical features
Clinical features of PTSD include:

Experiencing the trauma again and again through visions of the
incident, nightmares, and ‘flashbacks’.
Avoiding things: the person avoids situations which remind her of the
traumatic incident; she is unable to remember things related to the
trauma and feels emotionally distant from people.
↑ arousal: sleep is disturbed, the person feels irritable, has difficulty
concentrating and is easily startled or scared. Panic attacks may
occur.
Many patients with PTSD feel depressed and lose interest in daily
life, feel tired or suffer aches and pains, and have suicidal feelings.

Management
Encourage the person to talk about what happened. Group
discussions are helpful, especially when the traumatic event has
affected many persons, such as refugees.
Reassure that emotional reactions are normal and not a sign of
madness.
Encourage person not to avoid situations that remind them of the
event.
The victim should not be left alone for some days. Make sure that
they are staying with caring relatives or friends.
For panic attacks, follow the steps suggested earlier.
For acute severe symptoms, use benzodiazepines for up to 4 weeks.
A course of antidepressants may help some patients.

Mental disorders in children and adolescents

P.768

In younger children, the most common and disabling disorders are
developmental; whilst in adolescents, emotional and behavioural
disorders linked to difficulties in school or at home are most common.
Mental retardation is a commonly recognized type of developmental
disorder.

Other developmental and mental disorders in children include:
Autism and other pervasive developmental disorders, characterized
by delays or loss of language abilities and marked impairment in
social relationships; typically presents in early to mid-childhood.
Attention deficit and hyperactivity, marked by impulsivity,
hyperactivity, and poor concentration; typically presents while the
child is in primary school.
Learning disabilities (specific) marked by specific impairments in
learning and cognitive abilities such as reading and writing; typically
presents when the child is in secondary school.
In adolescence, the most common mental disorders are depression,
substance abuse, psychoses, and conduct disorders (characterized by
antisocial behaviours). Mental health problems in adolescents may be
managed in a similar way to the way described earlier in the chapter.
Developmental disorders may require a specialist approach to
diagnosis and management. In general, if a child is brought to you with
the complaint of behaviour problems or difficulties in school, take a
developmental history first to rule out MR. Once MR has been ruled
out, consider the possibility of these conditions.

Child abuse
Children can be abused physically, emotionally, or sexually, affecting
their health and development. Both boys and girls can be abused, most
often by someone they know well. Abused children may have problems
with:
Physical health: bruises or cuts, fractures, cigarette burns; severe
cases can lead to death.
Sexual health: injuries to the sexual organs, pregnancy, and STIs.
Mental health: fear, aggression, poor concentration, bed-wetting
having previously gained control, depression, antisocial behaviour,
self-harm.
School performance: ↓in school performance.

Diagnosis
Ask the family; few adults will openly report that they feel a child
they know is being abused. It is essential that, if you suspect child
abuse, you ask the adult in a frank and open way about whether they
think the child is being physically, emotionally, or sexually hurt.
Ask the child: interview the child with her mother, or with another
adult who is definitely not a suspected abuser and whom the child
trusts. Do not ask questions about abuse until you have established
rapport with the child. If this means spending more time, then do so.
Ask: ‘Sometimes, children can get hurt by a grown-up person. Has
anyone grown-up hurt you recently?’ Do not force the child.
Examine the child: a child who has been abused is likely to be very
sensitive to being examined physically. Respect the child's privacy.
Explain what you are doing and why. Have a trusted family member
present during the examination. Document the findings in detail.
These may be needed in a police investigation. A thorough
examination of the child should include weight and height, injuries
on the body, and injuries or inflammation of the sexual organs,
including the anus.

Management
Your priority is the health and safety of the child. If you suspect the
child's life is in danger, refer the child immediately to a place of
safety.
Talk to the family members. Explain why you suspect abuse. Many
parents are not aware that their actions can be so damaging to the
child's health. Just telling them about the dangers of beating a child
or neglecting emotional needs may bring about change in their
behaviour.
If you suspect sexual abuse, then it is unlikely that the family will
accept it easily, particularly if the abuser is someone close to the
family. Do not accuse anyone. Instead, share your concerns openly
with the family and stress that if the abuse continues, the child's
health will be even more seriously affected.

Teach the child how to ensure his safety. Explain that the abuse is
not his fault and he should not feel guilty for having spoken out
about the abuse. It is important to make sure this never happened
again. Some suggestions on how to prevent abuse from recurring
are: to tell the abuser not to touch him in a firm manner; to run
away from the abuser to be with another adult who can protect you.
Put the family in touch with community supports. This might include
child support groups, family violence groups, legal support, child
protection agencies, the police, or specialist health professionals.
If the child abuse persists or is very serious, refer to a specialist
team.
Keep in close touch with the child and the family at regular intervals
for at least 6 months. Very often, the abuse stops once it has been
openly discussed. If it does not, you may need to encourage the
family to take action to stop it. Talk to the child each time; many
children do recover from the trauma, but some children will develop
mental health problems.

ABCDE of trauma assessment
Initial assessment (the primary survey) of multiply-injured patient
must identify and treat life-threatening injuries. Multiple casualties
require prioritization (triage) according to need and available
resources.
The ABCDE system allows rapid systematic assessment and
simultaneous treatment of life threatening injuries. Do not move onto
the next system until the current problem is treated. If the patient
deteriorates, go back to the beginning and assess again.
•

Airway

— can the patient talk to you and breathe freely?
— give supplemental oxygen if available

•

Breathing

— is the patient breathing (look, listen, and feel)?
— is breathing adequate?

•

Circulation

— can peripheral or central pulses be felt?
— is capillary refill <3 seconds?

•

Disability

— use AVPU for rapid neurological assessment

•

•

Alert/Awake.

•

Verbal response.

•

Painful response.

•

Unresponsive.

Exposure

— undress the patient and look for injury.

Airway management
If the patient can speak clearly, they have a patent airway and are
breathing. Signs of airway obstruction include:
snoring or gurgling.
stridor.
using accessory muscles of respiration.
cyanosis agitation.

Treatment
1. Simple airway management
chin lift/jaw thrust.
suction.
insert an adjunct oral or nasopharyngeal airway.
If these manoeuvres do not help or the patient is apnoeic, hypoxic,
unconscious, or has severe head chest or neck trauma, move onto:

2. Advanced airway management
tracheal intubation (with neck immobilization).
surgical access — cricothyroid puncture or tracheostomy depending
on equipment, skill, and resources.

Breathing (ventilation) management
Once the airway is patent, the next priority is adequate ventilation.
Inspect (look) for the following:
respiratory rate and pattern.
cyanosis.
chest injury e.g. penetrating injury, flail chest, or a sucking injury.
use of accessory muscles or respiration i.e. breathing is hard work.
Palpate (feel) for:
tracheal shift.
broken ribs.
subcutaneo.us emphysema.
percuss for hyperresonanace or dullness.
Auscultate (listen) for:
pneumothorax (decreased breath sounds on side injury).
abnormal sounds in chest.

Management
Pneumothorax: if under tension, immediately insert a large bore
needle (e.g. 16 g venflon) into the second intercostal space in the
midclavicular line. Insert an intercostals drain once decompressed.
Penetrating injury: may require surgical exploration.
Flail chest: will require analgesia, O2, chest drain ± ventilation.
Sucking chest wound (open pneumothorax): apply waterproof patch
secured on three sides, a chest drain, and give analgesia.
Massive haemothorax: obtain iv access, give fluid resuscitation, and
insert a chest drain. Start surgical exploration if >1500-2000 ml blood
initially or >200-300 ml/hr.

Circulatory management
The goal is to stop bleeding and restore oxygen delivery to the tissues.
Fluid resuscitation is essential, as the usual problem is blood loss.
Insert two large bore (14-16 G) cannulae. A peripheral cut down may
be necessary.
Take blood specimens for the laboratory e.g. crossmatch.
Start warmed (in a bucket of warm water) crystalloid infusion.

Stop bleeding
Limb injuries: do not use tourniquets. Place gauze packs under the
fascia, plus manual compression of proximal artery, plus compressive
dressing of the entire injured limb.
Chest injuries: chest wall arteries are the most common source of
bleeding. Place an intercostal chest drain and give iv ketamine (see
Table 20.1) for pain relief. The expanded lung should tamponade
bleeding.
Abdominal injuries: a damage control laparotomy (DCL) is required
as soon as possible if fluid resuscitation fails to achieve a systolic BP
of 80-90 mm Hg. DCL is not a surgical procedure but a resuscitative
one, involving gauze packing of bleeding abdominal quadrants and
temporary closure of the abdominal wound with towel clamps. The
procedure should be observed before being done, but should be
within the capabilities of any trained doctor or nurse and is carried
out under ketamine anaesthesia. DCL can save lives.
Pelvic fractures: stabilize the pelvis — by tying a sheet around
pelvis.

Volume replacement and warming
Warm fluid replacement: hypothermic patients do not clot so well!
Even in hot climates, trauma patients quickly become hypothermic,
especially when being treated outside. IV and per-oral fluids should

have a temperature of 40-42°C.
Hypotensive fluid resuscitation: if haemostasis is not complete,
control blood loss by maintaining systolic BP at 80-90 mmHg until
definitive haemostasis can be achieved.
Blood transfusion: consider transfusion when there is persistent
haemodynamic instability despite fluid resuscitation or when Hb is
<7 g/dl with ongoing bleeding. Use type O negative packed cells if
cross-matched or type-specific blood is not available. Remember the
patients' family or friends may be able to donate blood for them but
beware of incompatibility and blood-borne infections.
Per-oral fluid resuscitation: is safe and efficient if the patient has a
gag reflex and is without abdominal injury. Oral fluids should contain
low concentrations of sugar and salt to avoid ‘osmotic pull’ into the
intestines. Diluted cereal porridges based on local foodstuffs are
ideal.

Analgesia
Ketamine 0.2 mg/kg in repeated doses is the drug of choice as it has
positive ionotropic effects and does not depress gag reflex.

Shock
Defined as inadequate organ perfusion leading to inadequate tissue
oxygenation. In the trauma patient, often due to haemorrhage and
hypovolaemia but can occur from other causes.

1. Haemorrhagic (hypovolaemic shock):
due to acute loss of blood or fluids. It is easy to underestimate blood
loss. Remember that large volumes may be hidden in abdomen, pleura,
femoral, or pelvic fracture (latter may lose >2 L). In young fit patients,
signs of blood loss may not be obvious until >1 L has been lost.

2. Cardiogenic shock:
due to inadequate cardiac function. May be due to:
myocardial contusion.
cardiac tamponade.
tension pneumothorax (preventing venous return).
penetrating wound to heart.
myocardial infarction.

Assessment of JVP and ECG may be helpful. Treat: the cause.

3. Neurogenic shock:
classically presents as hypotension with no reflex tachycardia or skin
vasoconstriction. Cause is loss of sympathetic tone secondary to spinal
cord injury. Treatment: fluids, vasoconstrictors, stabilization ± surgery
to spine. Exclude other causes of shock.

4. Septic shock:
rare in early phase of trauma, but common in weeks following injury.
Most commonly seen in penetrating abdominal injuries and burns
patients. Common cause of late death in trauma patient.

Treatment:
treat cause of sepsis early (see

p 670), support organs.

Urine output:
useful marker of intravascular volume status and response to
resuscitation. Expect an output of >0.5 ml/kg/h if resuscitation is
adequate.

Secondary survey
A secondary survey is only done when the patient's ABCs are stable. If
any deterioration occurs during this phase, a second primary survey
(ABCDE) must be performed to find and treat the problem.
Documentation is required for all procedures undertaken.
Head-to-toe examination is now undertaken, noting particularly:

1. Head examination
scalp and ocular abnormalities.
external ear and tympanic membrane injury.
periorbital soft tissue injuries.

2. Neck examination
penetrating wounds.
subcutaneous emphysema.
tracheal deviation.
neck vein appearance.

3. Neurological examination
brain function — assess using the Glasgow Coma Scale (

p 399).

spinal cord motor activity.
sensation and reflex.

4. Chest examination
clavicles and all ribs.
breath sounds and heart sounds.
ECG monitoring (if available).

5. Abdominal examination
surgical exploration is required for a penetrating wound.
blunt trauma — insert a nasogastric tube (not in the presence of
facial trauma).

Chest trauma

P.778

About 25% of trauma deaths are due to thoracic injury. However, most
patients with thoracic trauma can be effectively managed by simple
manoeuvres. Respiratory distress may be caused by: rib fractures/flail
chest, pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, haemothorax, pulmonary
contusion (bruising), open pneumothorax, aspiration. Haemorrhagic
shock may be due to: haemothorax, haemomediastinum.
Rib fractures: may damage underlying lung and produce lung bruising
or puncture. The ribs usually become fairly stable within 10 days to
two weeks. Firm healing with callus formation is seen after about six
weeks.
Flail chest: the unstable segment moves separately and in an
opposite direction from the rest of the thoracic cage during the
respiration cycle, causing severe respiratory distress. This is a
medical emergency and can be treated with positive pressure
ventilation and analgesia.
Tension pneumothorax: develops when air enters the pleural space
but cannot leave. The consequence is progressively increasing
intrathoracic pressure in the affected side, resulting in mediastinal
shift. Urgent needle decompression is required prior to the insertion
of an intercostal drain. The trachea may be displaced (a late sign).

Haemothorax: is more common in penetrating than non-penetrating
injures to the chest. Continuing haemorrhage will cause severe
hypovolaemic shock and respiratory distress due to compression of
lung on the involved side. Therapy consists of the placement of a
large chest tube.
A haemothorax of 500-1500 ml that stops bleeding after insertion
of an intercostal catheter can generally be treated by closed
drainage alone.
A haemothorax of greater than 1500-2000 ml or with continued
bleeding of more than 200-300 ml per hour may be an indication
for further investigation e.g. thoracotomy.
Pulmonary contusion (bruising): is common after chest trauma and
may be a life-threatening condition. The onset of symptoms can be
slow. It is likely to occur in cases of high-speed crashes or falls from
a great height. Clinical features include: shortness of breath,
hypoxaemia, tachycardia, absent breath sounds, rib fractures, and
cyanosis.
Open or ‘sucking’ chest wounds of the chest wall: the lung on the
affected side is exposed to atmospheric pressure causing it to
collapse and a shift of the mediastinum to the uninvolved side.
Rapid treatment is required. A seal (e.g. a plastic packet) is
sufficient to stop the sucking. In compromised patients, intercostal
drains, intubation, and positive pressure are required.
Other thoracic injuries carry a high mortality even in regional
centres. They include myocardial contusion, pericardial tamponade,
thoracic great vessel injuries, rupture of trachea or major bronchi,
trauma to oesophagus, and diaphragmatic injuries.

Abdominal trauma
The abdomen is commonly injured in multiple trauma. The most
common organ injured in penetrating trauma is the liver and, in blunt
trauma, the spleen is often torn and ruptured. The first priority is to
undertake the primary survey with evaluation of ABCDE.

Any patient involved in any serious accident should be considered to
have an abdominal injury until proven otherwise. Unrecognized
abdominal injury remains a frequent cause of preventable death after
trauma.
There are two basic categories of abdominal trauma:
penetrating trauma where surgical consultation is important e.g.
gunshot, stabbing.
non-penetrating trauma e.g. compression, crush, seat belt,
acceleration/deceleration injuries.
About 20% of trauma patients with acute haemoperitoneum (blood in
abdomen) have no signs of peritoneal irritation at the first
examination and the value of repeated primary survey cannot be
overstated. Blunt trauma can be very difficult to evaluate, especially
in unconscious patients.
Complete physical examination of the abdomen includes rectal
examination, assessing sphincter tone, integrity of rectal wall, blood in
the rectum, prostate position. Check for blood at the external urethral
meatus. Urinary catheterization (with caution in pelvic injury) is
important. Women should be considered pregnant until proven
otherwise. The foetus may be salvageable and the best treatment of
the foetus is resuscitation of the mother. A pregnant mother at term,
however, can usually only be resuscitated properly after delivery of
the baby.

Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)
May be helpful in determining the presence of blood or enteric fluid in
abdomen. If there is any doubt, a laparotomy is still the gold standard.
The indications for DPL include: unexplained abdominal pain, trauma
of the lower part of the chest, hypo-tension/haematocrit fall with no
obvious explanation, abdominal trauma in a patient with altered
mental state (drugs, alcohol, brain injury), patient with abdominal
trauma and spinal cord injuries, and pelvic fractures. The relative
contraindications for the DPL are: pregnancy; previous abdominal
surgery; operator inexperience; the result will not change

management.

Pelvic fractures
Often complicated by massive haemorrhage and urology injury.
Examine the rectum for the position of the prostate, the presence of
blood, and rectal/perineal laceration. The management of pelvic
fractures includes: resuscitation and immobilization, analgesia,
transfusion, and consideration of surgery.

Head trauma
Early assessment and treatment of head-injured patients is essential to
improve survival and outcome. Hypoxia and hypotension double the
mortality of head-injured patients. The following conditions are
potentially life-threatening; triage casualties carefully and treat what
you can with available expertise and resources:
Acute extradural haematoma — classically, a rapid deterioration in
conscious level following a lucid interval. A middle meningeal artery
bleed causes an acute increase in intracranial pressure and
development of contralateral hemiparesis and ipsilateral dilated
pupil.
Acute subdural haematoma — tearing of a bridging vein between
cortex and dura results in clotted blood in the subdural space ±
severe contusion of the underlying brain.
Management of the above conditions is surgical and every effort should
be made to do burr-hole decompressions (see
p 430). The diagnosis
can be made on history and examination.
The conditions below should be treated with more conservative
medical management, as neurosurgery usually does not improve
outcome:
Base-of-skull fractures — suggested by bruising of the eyelids
(Raccoon eyes) or over the mastoid process (Battle's sign), or a
cerebrospinal fluid leak from ears and/or nose.
Cerebral concussion — producing temporary altered consciousness

Depressed skull fracture — an impaction of fragmented skull that
may penetrate the underlying dura and brain.
Intracerebral haematoma — may result from acute injury or
progressive damage secondary to contusion.

Management
Basic medical management for severe head injuries includes:
ADCDE primary survey with C-spine control.
Intubation and moderate hyperventilation, producing low normal
PCO2 (to 4.5-5 Kpa). This temporarily reduces intracranial blood
volume and intracranial pressure. Hypoxia and hypoventilation may
kill patients.
Sedation with paralysis as necessary.
Moderate IV fluid input with diuresis i.e. do not overload.
Nursing head up 20%.
Prevent hyperthermia.
Record the GCS (
p 399): severe head injury is when GCS is 8 or less;
moderate head injury, GCS 9 to 12; and minor head injury, GCS 13 to
15.

Deterioration may occur due to bleeding
Unequal or dilated pupils may indicate an increase in intracranial
pressure. Brain injury is never the cause of hypotension in the adult
trauma patient. The Cushing reflex is a specific response to a lethal
rise in intracranial pressure. This is a late and poor prognostic sign.
The hallmarks are: bradycardia, hypertension, decreased respiratory
rate.

Spinal trauma
The incidence of nerve injury in multiple trauma is high. Injuries to
the C-spine and the thoraco-lumbar junction T12-L1 are common.

Other common injuries include brachial plexus injury and nerve
damage to legs and fingers.

First priority = primary survey with evaluation
of ABCDE
Examination of spine-injured patients must be carried out with
patients in the neutral position (i.e. without flexion, extension, or
rotation) and with-out any movement of the spine. The patient should
be log-rolled (i.e. moved by several people, working together to keep
neck and spine immobilized); their neck immobilized with a stiff
cervical neck collar or sandbags; and transported in a neutral position
(i.e. supine).
Vertebral injury (which may cause spinal cord injury): search for
local tenderness, deformities for a posterior ‘step-off’ injury, and
swelling.
Cervical spine injury: look for
difficulties in respiration (diaphragmatic/paradoxical breathing)
flaccid muscle tone absent reflexes (check rectal sphincter)
hypotension with bradycardia (without hypovolaemia).

C-spine X-ray:
AP and a lateral X-ray (showing all seven C vertebrae) with a view of
the atlas-axis joint.

Neurological assessment
Assessment of the level of injury guides immediate treatment, assesses
progression, and gives an idea of prognosis. Ask the patient questions
relevant to her/his sensation and try to ask her/him to do minor
movements to assess motor function in the limbs.

Limb trauma
Examination
Must include:
skin colour and temperature.
distal pulse assessment.
grazes and bleeding sites.
limb alignment and deformities.
active and passive movements.
unusual movements and crepitation.
level of pain caused injury.

Management
of extremity injuries should aim to:
keep blood flowing to peripheral tissues.
prevent infection and skin necrosis.
prevent damage to peripheral nerves.

Special issues relating to limb trauma
1. Stop active bleeding by direct pressure, rather than by tourniquet,
as a tourniquet can be left on by mistake, resulting in ischaemic
damage.
2. Compartment syndrome: is caused by increasing pressure inside
fascial compartments. Common in injuries with intramuscular
haematomas, crush injuries, fractures, or amputations. Increasing
pressure results in local circulatory collapse by compression of local
vessels and peripheral nerves. Tissue perfusion becomes limited and
ischaemic; necrotic muscles with restricted function can even result
if the perfusion pressure (systolic BP) is low. Clinical features of
compartment syndrome:
pain out of keeping with injury.
tense compartments.
passive stretch test — painful on moving foot or lower limb.
parasthesia.
pulse lost — but this is a late sign.
Damage on reperfusion is often serious. If there is local hypoxaemia
(high IM pressure, low BP) for more than 2 h, reperfusion can cause
extensive vascular damage. Decompression by fasciotomy should be
done early. The forearm and lower leg compartments are at particular
risk.
3. Traumatically amputated body parts should be covered with
moist-ened sterile gauze towels and put into a sterile plastic bag.

A non-cooled amputated part may be used within 6 h after injury; a
cooled one as late as 18 to 20 h.

Paediatric trauma
Trauma is a leading cause of death in children. Survival of children
who sustain major trauma depends on early resuscitation. The initial
assessment of the paediatric trauma patient is identical to that for the
adult, following ABCD, and finally exposing the child, without losing
heat.
Blood volume is proportionately greater in children and is calculated
at 80 ml/kg in a child and 85-90 ml/kg in the neonate. A
height/weight chart is the easiest method of approximating weight
of a seriously ill child.
Venous access in children who are hypovolaemic can be difficult.
Useful sites for cannulation include: long saphenous vein over the
ankle, external jugular vein, and femoral veins. The intraosseous
route can provide the quickest access to the circulation in a shocked
child.
Recognition of hypovolaemia can be difficult. The increased
physiological reserves of the child may result in the vital signs being
only slightly abnormal despite up to 25% of blood volume being lost.
Tachycardia is often the earliest response, but this can also be
caused by fear or pain.
Fluid management: give 20 ml/kg of crystalloid fluid initially to a
child showing signs of Class 2 hypovolaemia or worse, repeated up to
2× (up to 60 ml/kg) depending on the response. Children with little
or no response to the initial fluid challenge require further
crystalloid fluids and blood transfusion: 20 ml/kg of whole blood or
10 ml/kg of packed red cells should be initially transfused in these
circumstances.
Heat loss occurs rapidly due to the high surface-to-mass ratio in a
child. A child who is hypothermic may become refractory to
treatment.
Acute gastric dilatation is commonly seen in the seriously ill or

injured child. Gastric decompression, via a nasogastric tube, is
essential.
Analgesia should not be withheld. A recommended regime is a 50
mcg/ kg IV bolus of morphine, followed by 10-20 mcg/kg increments
at 10 minute intervals until an adequate response is achieved.

Burns
The source of the burn is important e.g. fire, hot water, paraffin,
kerosene, electric shock, as this may point towards associated

problems e.g. inhalational injury. Electrical burns are often more
serious than they appear. Damaged skin and muscle can result in acute
renal failure.

Management
stop the burning (remove source and cool).
ABCDE, then determine depth and area of burn (Rule of 9′s).
obtain good IV access and give early fluid replacement.

Burned surface area:
morbidity and mortality increase with area burned and age, so that
even small burns can be fatal in elderly people. Burns >15% in an adult,
>10% in a child, or any occurring in the very young or elderly are
considered serious.
Rule of 9′s is commonly used to estimate the burned surface area:
Adults: head 9%, torso 18%, arms 9% each, legs 18% each, genitalia
1%. Children: use the palm of the child's' hand to represent 1%
surface area.

Depth of burn
first degree — red, pain, no blisters.
second degree — red or mottled, pain blisters.
third degree — dark and leathery, no pain, dry.
It is common to find all three depths within the same burn.

Fluid resuscitation:
in the first 24 h from time of burn, give 2-4 mls/kg/ % surface area
burned. Give half in first 8 h and half in next 16 h. e.g. an 80 kg adult
with 25% burns would require:
80×25×2-4 ml in 24 h = 4000-8000 ml over 24 hour period; 2000-4000
over first 8 hour, then 2000-4000 over the subsequent 16 h.

Other considerations
The site of the burn determines its severity. Burns to the face, neck,
hands, feet, perineum, and circumferential burns (those encircling a
limb, neck, etc.) are classified as serious.
Beware inhalation injury in patient with facial burns, singed facial or
nasal hair, hoarseness, and circumferential full thickness burns of the
chest or neck. These patients need early intubation or tracheostomy
before laryngeal oedema makes it impossible!
Associated trauma or pre-burn illness.

Serious burns requiring hospitalization
>10% in child, >15% in adult; any in very young, elderly, infirm; full
thickness or circumferential; with inhalation; burns of face, hands,
feet, perineum. See also:

Pregnant trauma patients
The ABCDE priorities of trauma management in pregnant patients are
the same as those in non-pregnant patients. However, anatomical and
physiological changes occur in pregnancy that are extremely important
in the assessment of the pregnant trauma patient.

Anatomical changes
The size of the uterus gradually increases and becomes more
vulnerable to damage by both blunt and penetrating injury
12 weeks of gestation, the fundus is at the symphysis pubis.
20 weeks, it is at the umbilicus.
36 weeks, it is at the xiphoid.
The foetus in the first trimester is well protected by the thick walled
uterus, pelvis, and large amounts of amniotic fluid.

Physiological changes
increased tidal volume and respiratory alkalosis.
increased heart rate.
30% increased cardiac output.
usually lower BP, by 15 mmHg .
aortocaval compression in the second and third trimester when the
woman is lying flat, leading to hypotension.

Special issues in the traumatized pregnant
female
blunt trauma may lead to uterine irritability and premature labour.
beware partial/complete rupture of the uterus.
beware partial/complete placental separation (up to 48 h later).
beware severe blood loss after pelvic fracture.

Management
1. Assess mother according to the ABCDE.
2. Resuscitate in left lateral position to avoid aortocaval compression.
3. Perform vaginal examination with a speculum to look for vaginal
bleeding and cervical dilatation.
4. Mark the fundal height and assess tenderness.
5. Monitor the foetal heart rate as appropriate.
Resuscitation of mother may save the baby. However, there are times
when the only option to save the mother is to deliver the baby by
Caesarian section. Remember: aortocaval compression must be
prevented in resuscitation of the traumatized pregnant woman.

Obstetric emergencies

More than 99% of all maternal deaths occur in the developing world.
Around 50% of women worldwide give birth without a skilled attendant
and with no antenatal care. Prevention is the key. The WHO in its
Standards for Maternal and Neonatal Care sets out strategies for
reducing maternal mortality:
Family planning.
Antenatal care.
Clean/safe delivery.
Essential obstetric care.

Management
Assess using ABCDE in the lateral position and resuscitate.
Be aware that the mother will probably deliver without medical
intervention in her next pregnancy, so a uterine scar (from
Caesarean section) is best avoided if possible.
If the baby is alive, Consider Caesarean section or symphysiotomy
(division of symphysis pubis).
If the baby is dead, consider, with the mother's consent,
symphysiotomy or destructive procedure (e.g. craniotomy) for baby.
Sepsis may require evacuation of products of conception as well as
antibiotics and resuscitation.
Eclampsia (seizures associated with hypertension in pregnancy) is
best treated with magnesium sulphate 4 g iv over 10-15 mins.
Haemorrhage: all women need oxygen, 2 large bore venous
cannulae, crystalloid, colloid, and blood resuscitation. Treat in left
lateral position or manual uterine displacement. Assess for and treat
coagulopathy.

Common causes of haemorrhage
Uterine atony — treat with oxytocics/ergometrin/prostaglandin,
massage + bimanual compression. Empty the uterus of foetus ±

products of conception, repair lacerations, pack the uterus or use
Rusch balloon to tamponade bleeding. Manual compression of aorta
gives temporary control to allow resuscitation. A B-lynch suture may
help at Caesarean. Perform a hysterectomy if necessary.
Placenta praevia — deliver by Caesarean. There is risk of postpartum
haemorrhage.
Uterine rupture — perform laparotomy and repair the rupture.
Genital tract trauma — find and repair injury.
Uterine inversion — replace the uterus manually or with water
pressure.
Ectopic pregnancy — diagnose and operate.
The following are often associated with coagulopathy as well as
haemorrhage: placental abruption, sepsis, dead foetus retained for
some time, and amniotic fluid embolus.

Poisoning and Envenoming

Acute poisoning
Most deaths from acute poisoning are due to deliberate self-poisoning.
Although drug poisoning is common in urban areas of the developing
world, the majority of deaths occur in rural areas after ingestion of
pesticides. Whilst outcome seems to be determined purely by the
amount ingested for some pesticides, good management for poisoning
by other agents can reduce the death rate.

General management
Resuscitate and stabilize (see life support algorithms inside front
cover). In particular, take care of the airway, intubating any patient
unable to protect their own airway (check cough and gag intact).
Give high-flow oxygen — except for paraquat poisoned patients.
Place the patient on their left side to reduce risk of aspiration and
the passage of poison from stomach; it will also keep the airway
open.
If the patient has taken a pesticide, determine whether he/she
needs atropine (see
p 792).

Suck out secretions as necessary (however, in organophosphate
poisoning, patients will require atropine to control secretions).
Get a history. What has been taken? How much and when? Have a
handbook available that lists pesticides by both their chemical class
and trade name since many people will only know the latter.
Calm the patient. An agitated poisoned patient makes management
difficult and increases risk of aspiration — consider giving diazepam.
Watch out for and control convulsions. First-line therapy is
diazepam; second-line is phenobarbital (see
p 792).
Give antidotes according to the poison ingested — poison identity
can come from history or recognition of a ‘toxidrome’ (see box).
Finally, consider the value of performing gastric emptying or
decontamination once everything else is done.
Gastric lavage and induced emesis: are no longer recommended in
the routine management of a poisoned patient. Studies have shown
little return of poison even when performed in ideal circumstances.
Gastric lavage is associated with increased rate of ICU admission and
aspiration pneumonia. It should only be considered within an hour of
the poisoning and only if it can be done safely in a consenting or
intubated patient. Gastric lavage performed in a non-consenting
struggling patient has a high risk of aspiration and death.
Activated charcoal: administered orally, is the recommended form of
GI decontamination. Activated charcoal offers a large surface area
for the poison to bind to, reducing absorption into the body. Give 50100 g (1 g/kg for children) dissolved in 200-300 ml of water.
Multiple doses of activated charcoal: some poisons are excreted in
the bile or diffuse across the intestinal wall into the lumen. In this
situation regular repeated administration of activated charcoal q4 h
may enhance elimination.
Osmotic cathartics: are no longer recommended. They increase the
risk of electrolyte abnormalities with no evidence of benefit.

Toxidromes

Patients are often unable or sometimes unwilling to state the exact
poison ingested. Treatment in these situations is based on clinical
signs and the locally most likely poison ingested. Toxidromes are
collections of signs which may assist in diagnosis (such as the
cholinergic or anticholinergic syndromes).

Classification of common pesticides
1. Insecticides
Organophosphates (OP): poisoning is often serious, requiring
treatment with atropine, pralidoxime, ± diazepam.
Carbamates: similar to OPs but AChE inhibition is briefer;
however, poisoning may still last 2-4 days and patients require
ventilation.
Organochlorines: being restricted globally due to environmental
persistence. Major problem with significant overdose is status
epilepticus.
Pyrethroids: low toxicity but may cause anaphylaxis.

2. Herbicides
Chlorphenoxy compounds: in large overdoses, cause decreased
consciousness and rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure.
Paraquat: no proven treatment is available. Management appears
not to alter clinical course.
Propanil: causes methaemoglobinaemia; few other signs.
Glyphosate: low toxicity unless pesticide and solvent is aspirated.

3. Rodenticides
Aluminium phosphide: very toxic. Consider giving severely
poisoned patients magnesium 1 g IV stat, then 1 g q1 h for 3 h,
then 1 g q6 h.
Zinc phosphide: less toxic. Treat supportively.
Coumarin derivatives: long-acting warfarin-like compounds. INR
>2 or active bleeding requires vitamin K 1 mg (sometimes for
prolonged periods).

Thallium: highly toxic. Banned in many countries.
Carbamates: the highly toxic carbamate, aldicarb, is widely used
as a rodenticide.
There are many other, often newer, pesticides. None have specific
antidotes; conservative management with airway support and
diazepam for seizures is probably best.

Acute pesticide poisoning
Early careful resuscitation and supportive care of pesticide-poisoned
patients, with correct use of antidotes, will reduce deaths. Most
pesticides are dissolved in organic solvents which can cause fatal
pneumonia if aspirated; other additives, such as methanol, can cause
additional toxicity. After 1 hour, gastric lavage and forced emesis is
futile because of a high risk of complications. Activated charcoal
should be adminstered orally or by NG tube.

Organophosphates/carbamates:
see

p 792.

Organochlorine poisoning:
pesticides such as endosulfan, endrin, and the less toxic lindane, cause
status epilepticus after large ingestions. Manage: with diazepam; give
phenobarbital and then general anaesthetic if no response (
p 438).
Many organochlorines are banned worldwide.

Pyrethroids:
synthetic derivatives of the plant-derived pyrethrin. Low toxicity but
may cause anaphylaxis. Manage: conservatively.

Chlorphenoxy herbicides:
include MCPA; 2,4-D; 2,4,5-T (latter two are more toxic). Cause coma
and rhabdomyolysis after large overdose. Observe for black urine

(indicates myoglobinuria) and muscle pain. Manage: keep high urine
output with IV fluids. Give sodium bicarbonate 3 mMol/kg if urine is
black. Normally has a good outcome if renal failure can be averted.

Paraquat:
uniformly fatal if taken in large amounts due to multi-organ failure.
Smaller doses may result in fatal lung fibrosis. Patients often have
marked ulceration of the mouth since they may just take it into their
mouth and then spit it out; oesophageal damage is a poor prognostic
sign, implying that the paraquat was swallowed. Intensive
haemofiltration may offer some slight benefit; high-dose
immunosuppression (cyclophosphamide 15 mg/kg IV od for 2 d;
methylprednisolone 1 g IV od for 3 d, followed by PO dexamethasone)
may prevent lung fibrosis, but definite evidence is not available.
Manage: conservatively. Activated charcoal should be given early.
Gastric lavage could be considered <1 hour after poisoning but if
performed later there is a risk of oesophageal perforation. Oxygen may
exacerbate lung fibrosis.

Propanil:
causes methaemoglobinaemia. The patient looks cyanosed but is
asymptomatic if metHb levels <20%; headaches and low GCS occur as
metHb level rises. Death occurs with metHb >70%. Manage: give
methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue) 1-2 mg/kg IV over 5 mins,
repeated after 30-60 mins as necessary, and/or exchange transfusion.

Glyphosate:
causes ulcerative damage to the oesophagus but little else. Do not
perform lavage since complications may occur after aspiration.

Gastric lavage for pesticide poisoning
Lavage must not be performed in combative, conscious patients
or in patients with reduced GCS unless intubated.
Lavage should only be considered when patients present <1 h after
ingestion of a potentially life-threatening amount of pesticide

(organophosphorus, organochlorine, carbamate, or paraquat).
Use an 18-gauge NG tube for pesticides — a larger bore tube has a
higher rate of complications.

Poisoning with corrosives
Acids cause an immediate mucosal burn that scabs over, limiting
damage. In contrast, alkalis produce a liquifactive necrosis that
produces much deeper tissue damage.

Clinical features:
pain in mouth, throat, and abdomen; dysphagia; drooling.
Complications include perforation, haemorrhage, and systemic
complications of particular corrosives. Patients with significant
poisoning are at high risk of strictures in oesophagus or stomach.

Management:
give O2 and obtain IV access for fluid resuscitation. Watch for signs
of airway obstruction or GI perforation. GI decontamination is
generally not indicated. Careful endoscopy is recommended soon
after admission to assess damage to GI tract and manage strictures.
Patients with alkali ingestions and circumferential oesophageal
burns may benefit from early steroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg BD).

Poisoning with hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbon toxicity occurs after pulmonary aspiration or after
systemic absorption.
Hydrocarbons can be grouped by volatility/viscosity and systemic
toxicity.
Poisoning with non-volatile, non-absorbed hydrocarbons such as
motor oil does not require treatment. The risk of aspiration is
low.
Poisoning with more volatile but non-toxic hydrocarbons, such as
kerosene, is very common. Aspiration pneumonia is the main
complication so treat conservatively without induction of
vomiting or lavage.

The management of volatile and toxic hydrocarbons such as
phenol is difficult. Lavage may be indicated in hope of
preventing systemic toxicity if the patients have taken a
significant dose and been admitted <1 h after ingestion. Beware
of causing aspiration pneumonia.
There is no general antidote; steroids are not indicated.

Organophosphates/carbamates
These pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at autonomic,
neuromuscular, and central synapses, causing acetylcholine (ACh) to
accumulate and overstimulate receptors. AChE reactivates quickly in
carbamate poisoning; the process is much slower in OP poisoning.
Atropine competes with and antagonizes ACh at muscarinic receptors;
oximes such as pralidoxime reactivate inhibited AChE. If oxime
treatment is delayed, the inhibited AChE may become ‘aged’ and resist
reactivation.

Clinical features:
Result from accumulation of ACh at muscarinic synapses (salivation,
bronchorrhoea, urination, diarrhoea, bradycardia, small pupils);
nicotinic synapses (muscle fasciculation and weakness, tachycardia,
large pupils); and CNS synapses (agitation, confusion, drowsiness →
coma). Inhibition of AChE over several days may result in failure of the
neuromuscular junction: the intermediate syndrome (initially neck
flexion weakness — ask patient to lift head from the pillow; sometimes
cranial nerve palsies → respiratory muscle weakness and sudden
respiratory arrest). Some OPs cause a peripheral motor neuropathy
after several weeks.

Diagnosis:
Is normally clinical, based on the typical features. Plasma
butyrylcholinesterase levels may support the diagnosis.

Management
Resuscitation and supportive care are the major initial priority. Any
decontamination should only be considered after patient
stabilization.
Give oxygen. Intubate early — as soon as the patient's GCS drops <1213. Give diazepam 10 mg IV slowly over 2-3 mins as required.
Simultaneously, give atropine 1.2-2.4 mg rapidly as a bolus.
Watch for a response in the markers of atropinization (see box).
If no response at 5 mins, double the dose of atropine.
Continue giving doubling doses of atropine until the chest is clear of
wheeze or crackles (beware sounds of aspiration) and pulse is above
80/minute. Tens or, rarely, hundreds of mg may be required.
Once the patient is atropinized (see opposite), set up an infusion
giving 20-40% per hour of the total bolus dose of atropine required.
For OPs and where the agent is unknown, give pralidoxime 2 g IV
slowly over 5-30 mins (a fast injection → emesis and tachycardia),
followed by an infusion of 500 mg/hr.
Treat convulsions with diazepam 10 mg IV slowly over 2-3 mins;
repeated as necessary. Intubate and ventilate if required.
Observe carefully to ensure that (i) the required amount of atropine
is being given — increase or decrease as required, and (ii) detect
neck weakness (= early intermediate syndrome) early so that a
patient can be intubated and ventilated before a respiratory arrest.
Also monitor tidal volume regularly.

Markers of atropinization
Sufficient atropine has been given when all of the following are
attained:
Chest clear (no wheeze or crackles).
Pulse >80 bpm.
Systolic BP >80 mmHg with urine output >0.5 ml/kg/hr.

Other signs of atropinization include:
Pupils no longer pinpoint.
Axilla (or oral mucosa) are dry.

Notes
Aspiration may complicate the chest criteria. Try to differentiate
between local creps of aspiration and generalized creps/wheeze
of OP poisoning.
The pupils may dilate late — after 30 mins or so.
There is no need to continue to give atropine until the heart rate
is 120-140 or the pupils widely dilated. The aim is to reverse the
poisoning, not induce atropine toxicity.

Markers of over-atropinization
Too much atropine is being given if:
Bowel sounds are absent.
Patient is in urinary retention.
Patient is confused (not alcohol-related).
Patient is febrile due to atropine.

Atropine-induced fevers:
particularly in patients agitated by alcohol withdrawal and in hot
environments — risk causing cardiac arrest.

Agitation:
can be decreased with oral or IV benzodiazepines. Reduce
temperature by sponging the patient and using a fan.

Acute poisoning with pharmaceuticals/chemicals
Relatively few pharmaceuticals have specific antidotes — the main aim
of management for most patients will be supportive care. There is no
evidence for any benefit from lavage, forced emesis, or activated
charcoal.
Benzodiazepines: patients present with drowsiness, slurred speech,

ataxia, rarely coma (small pupils/hyporeflexia), or respiratory
failure, due to the drugs' inhibitory effect on the CNS. Most patients
can simply be observed. In case of respiratory failure (often with
newer, short-acting drugs), intubate/ventilate. Severe poisoning can
be briefly reversed with flumazenil 0.2 mg IV over 15 secs repeated
with doses of 0.1 mg at 60 sec intervals if required, up to a
maximum of 1 mg. This drug must not be used if there are signs of
tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
Cardiac glycosides: can be due to overdose of digoxin medication or
ingestion of a source of natural glycoside (e.g. oleander seeds). Main
effects are on the heart: dysrhythmias and conduction block.
Atropine 0.5 mg IV for bradycardia is frequently used but is unlikely
to prevent severe dysrhythmia. Temporary cardiac pacing can tide
the patient through 3rd degree AV heart block. Anti-digoxin
antibodies can reverse DC-shock resistant VF or cardiogenic shock in
severe poisoning.
Isoniazid: may cause decreased consciousness, convulsions, coma,
respiratory arrest, metabolic acidosis. If severe, give pyridoxine by
slow IV injection (quantity equal to the quantity of isoniazid taken;
if quantity unknown, give 5 g). Repeat at 5-20 min intervals if there
is no response.
Lithium carbonate: affects CNS, heart, and kidney. Acute lithium
poisoning with normal renal function generally requires only
supportive care. In patients with poor renal function and severe
poisoning, haemodialysis is the best method to remove lithium.
Check serum electrolytes q6-12 h; if hypernatraemia is present, give
5% dextrose until plasma Na+ returns to normal. Since most patients
will be on chronic lithium therapy and have nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus, they will require high fluid maintenance rates.
Opiates: are found in analgesics and recreational drugs. Features
include respiratory depression, decreased consciousness, and
pinpoint pupils. Give repeated bolus of naloxone 0.4 mg (up to 2 mg)
IV. After the initial response, an infusion may be needed in longacting or sustained-release opioids; the starting dose is 50% of the
total initial bolus each hour. The major indicator of naloxone

response is reversal of respiratory depression. The response time is 9
± 4 mins to increase respiratory rate to >10/min. If more than 2 mg
naloxone is required review the diagnosis — has more than one drug
been taken?
Paracetamol: for ingestions of >150 mg/kg, give N-acetylcysteine IV
unless paracetamol blood levels can be measured and shown to be
safe. Dose = 150 mg/kg in 200 ml of 5% dextrose over 15 mins,
followed by 50 mg/kg in 500 ml of 5% dextrose over 4 h, and then 100
mg/kg in 1 litre over 16 h. If liver failure develops, continue since it
may
improve outcome. If unavailable, give methionine 2.5 g PO repeated
q4 h for a total of 4 doses. Check liver and kidney function. Closely
monitor blood glucose levels, watching for hypoglycaemia.
Salicylates: severe aspirin poisoning may present with CNS
depression, haematemesis, hyperthermia. However, lethal doses may
not affect consciousness. Lesser poisoning produces GI pain, N&V,
tinnitus. A mixed metabolic acidosis/respiratory alkalosis is
common. Metabolic acidosis occurs in young children; respiratory
alkalosis more commonly in older patients. Give charcoal and
correct electrolyte imbalances. If there are neurological signs, give
50 ml of 50% dextrose IV; repeat if necessary. Any metabolic acidoisis
should be corrected (even if there is respiratory compensation) with
sodium bicarbonate infusion; patients commonly require potassium
supplementation. Goal of bicarbonate treatment = restore normal
systemic pH and make the urine alkaline.
Tricyclic antidepressants: may present with signs of CNS toxicity
(convulsions, ophthalmoplegia, muscle twitching, delirium, coma,
respiratory depression), anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurred
vision, mydriasis), cardiotoxicity (QRS duration & QT prolongation),
hypothermia, pyrexia. Control convulsions; monitor heart and
correct arrhythmias; control acidosis. Give IV sodium bicarbonate
for cardiotoxicity or for seizures with an initial dose of 3 mmol/kg.
This dose can be repeated and titrated against clinical response. The
pH should be assessed, if possible, after a total dose of 6 mmol/kg
and should not exceed pH 7.55.

Cyanide: late presentations include dyspnoea, cyanosis, or
unconsciousness. Altered mental status, tachypnoea (in absence of
cyanosis), unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis, and bright red
blood are earlier signs. Adminster O2; correct acidosis; give
amylnitrite by inhalation over 30 secs each minute until other drugs
are prepared. Then give: sodium nitrite 300 mg by IV injection over
5-20 mins followed by sodium thiosulfate 12.5 g IV over 10 mins
(alternative: dicobalt edetate 300 mg IV over 1 min followed by 50
mls of 50% dextrose. Repeat ×2 if required. Do not use if the
diagnosis is uncertain).
Metal ions (e.g. gold, mercury, zinc, lead, copper): acute poisoning
can cause coma, convulsions, and death, or affect multiple organ
systems. Anticipate and treat shock, renal or hepatic failure. Give
penicillamine 1-2 g PO od in 3 divided doses (2 h before meals, if
possible) for 2-4 weeks. Get a senior opinion. An alternative option
(preferred in mercury poisoning) is dimercaprol (BAL; British antiLewisite) 2.5-3 mg/kg q4 h for 2 days; then q6 h on the 3rd day; and
bd for days 4-10 or until recovery.

Mushroom poisoning
Mushrooms cause a variety of toxicological syndromes affecting the
CNS, kidney, liver, muscle, and GI tract. Clinical features are separated
into those appearing early (<6 h) or late (around 6 h or later).

Clinical features
1. Early symptoms
starting within a few hrs: gastroenteritis, cholinergic (muscarinic)
effects, confusion, visual hallucinations, or antabuse-like reactions to
drinking alcohol, according to the species ingested.

2. Delayed symptoms
starting 6 h to many days later suggest more dangerous poisoning:
Gastroenteritis with hepato- and nephro-toxicity (amatoxin

poisoning) is caused by the death cap mushroom (Amanita
phalloides) and others from the Amanita, Galerina, and Lepiota
genera. Abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhoea start after
6-24 (usually 12) hours resulting in dehydration. Hepatic and renal
failure evolve over the next few days or weeks.
Gastroenteritis with neurological symptoms (gyromitrin poisoning)
caused by false morel (Gyromitra esculenta). Gastroenteritis,
bloating, severe headache, vertigo, pyrexia, sweating, diplopia,
nystagmus, ataxia, and cramps are followed by delirium, coma,
hepatic and renal damage, hypoglycaemia, and haemolysis.
Renal damage may develop 2-17 days after eating Cortinarius species
(orellanine poisoning). Fatigue, intense thirst, headache, chills,
paraesthesiae, tinnitus and abdominal, lumbar, and flank pain are
the prelude to polyuria, oliguria, and anuria.
Rhabdomyolysis occurs after ingestion of Tricholoma species due to a
myotoxin.

Management
Give activated charcoal 50 g q2 h for at least 48 h.
Correct hypovolaemia, acid-base disturbances, hypoglycaemia, and
renal failure.
Give atropine (adult 0.6-1.8 mg IV) for cholinergic features.
Give physostigmine (adult 1-2 mg IV) or diazepam (adults 5-10 mg IV)
for anticholinergic hallucinations.
For amatoxic fungal poisoning, give large doses of benzylpenicillin
(2.4 g q6 h; N-acetylcysteine may have benefit). Liver
transplantation may be necessary.
Gyromitrin fungal poisoning is treated with pyridoxine 25 mg/kg over
30 min, 5% dextrose IV, and diuresis.

Prevention
Discourage the ingestion of any wild fungi, especially those with white

gills. Cooking does not destroy their poisons.

Fish and shellfish poisoning

P.798

Ciguatera fish poisoning:
>50,000 cases occur each year. In some Pacific islands ~1% are
affected/year, case fatality 0.1%. Due to accumulation of toxins from
the flagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus in muscles of carnivorous fish at
the top of the food chain. The toxins activate sodium channels.
Gastroenteritis develops 1-6 h after eating warm-water shore or reef
fish (groupers, snappers, parrot fish, mackerel, moray eels,
barracudas, jacks). Gastrointestinal symptoms resolve within a few
hours, but paraesthesiae, pruritis, and myalgia may persist for a week
to months.

Tetrodoxin poisoning:
scaleless porcupine, sun, puffer, and toad fish (order:
Tetraodonitiformes) become poisonous seasonally. Puffer fish (‘fugu’) is
relished in Japan. Neurotoxic symptoms develop 10-45 min after eating
the fish and death from respiratory paralysis 2-6 h later.

Scombroid poisoning (histamine-like syndrome):
bacterial contamination and decomposition of e.g. dark-fleshed tuna,
mackerel, bonito, and skipjack, and of canned fish releases histamine.
Buccal tingling or smarting is followed by flushing, burning, sweating,
urticaria, pruritis, headache, abdominal colic, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea, asthma, giddiness and hypotension.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning:
bivalve mollusks (mussels, clams, oysters, cockles, and scallops)
become toxic when there is a ‘red tide’ of algal blooms. Within 30 min
of ingestion, paralysis begins and, in 8% of cases, progresses to fatal
respiratory paralysis within 12 h.

Management (of all types of fish/shellfish
poisoning)
Promote vomiting and diarrhoea with emetics and purges.
Scombroid poisoning responds to antihistamines, bronchodilators,
and adrenaline.
Assisted ventilation is required in severe paralytic poisoning.

Prevention:
marine poisons are not destroyed by cooking or boiling.
local advice should be sought about what is safe to eat.
prevent ingestion of shellfish when there is a ‘red tide’.
very large reef fish (ciguatera poisoning) and any parts of the fish
other than muscle should not be eaten.
notorious species such as Moray eels (ciguatera poisoning) or puffer
fish (tetrodotoxin poisoning) should never be eaten.

Leech bite
Land leeches infest the rainforest floor, attaching to legs or ankles.
After a painless bite, they ingest blood and then drop off, but the
wound continues to bleed and the clot is fragile. Aquatic leeches are
swallowed in river or pond water, or they attack bathers, entering
the mouth, nostrils, eyes, vulva, vagina, urethra, or anus.

Clinical features
The main effect is blood loss. Other symptoms include secondary
infection (by Aeromonas hydrophila with medicinal leeches),
itching, and phobia. Ingested aquatic leeches attach to the pharynx,
producing a sensation of movement at the back of the throat,
cough, hoarseness, stridor, breathlessness, epistaxis, haemoptysis,
haematemesis, or upper airway obstruction, or they penetrate
bronchi or oesophagus. Via the anus, they may reach the

rectosigmoid junction, causing perforation and peritonitis.

Treatment
Apply salt, a flame, alcohol, turpentine, or vinegar to the leech to
encourage detachment. Control local bleeding with a styptic, such
as silver nitrate, or a firm dressing. Penetrating aquatic leeches
must be removed endoscopically. Spray with 10% tartaric acid or
1:10,000 adrenaline (nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, or oesophagus)
or irrigate with concentrated saline (GU tract and rectum).

Prevention
Trousers, socks, and footwear should be impregnated and skin
anointed with DEET. Children should be discouraged from bathing in
leech-infested waters. People should not drink from natural water
sources and drinking water must boiled.

Snake bite
Most parts of the world have venomous snakes. In W Africa, S Asia,
New Guinea, and Latin America, snakes maim or kill many farmers and
children. Medically important groups are elapids (e.g. cobras,
mambas), vipers, pit vipers, and burrowing asps. Although there are
100s of different species, you need only know about the dangerous ones
where you live and work.

Clinical features (depending on the species
involved)
Local swelling, bruising, blistering, regional lymph node
enlargement, and tissue damage (necrosis). Occur with vipers, pit
vipers, burrowing asps, and some cobras.
Incoagulable blood, shown by 20 min clotting test (see opposite),
spontaneous bleeding from gums, nose, skin, gut, GU tract;
persistent bleeding from wounds. Occurs with vipers, pit vipers,
South African boomslangs, and Australasian elapids.

Shock (hypotension) and arrhythmias. Occur with vipers, pit vipers,
and burrowing asps.
Descending paralysis (ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, bulbar and
respiratory muscle paralysis). Occurs with elapids, a few vipers and
pit vipers.
Generalized rhabdomyolysis (myalgia, myoglobinuria — black urine
+ve for blood). Occurs with sea snakes, Australasian elapids, a few
vipers and pit vipers.
Acute renal failure. Occurs with sea snakes, some vipers and pit
vipers.

Hospital treatment
First aid — see opposite.
Assess and observe patients carefully for at least 24 h.
Antivenom, the only specific antidote, is indicated for any signs of
systemic envenoming listed above or for local envenoming that is
rapidly spreading or involves more than half the bitten limb or
digits. Give an appropriate antivenom (check package insert for
species covered) by slow IV injection or infusion.
Watch for early signs of anaphylactoid reactions and treat with IM
adrenaline (adult 0.5 mg, child 10 mcg/kg) and IV H1 antihistamine
and hydrocortisone 200 mg. Don't waste time with non-predictive
hypersensitivity tests.
Give a tetanus toxoid booster but antibiotics only if there is local
necrosis, contaminated bite site, or abscess.
Bulbar/respiratory paralysis requires intubation and assisted
ventilation.
Correct hypovolaemia (bleeding or extravasation into swollen
limbs).
Treat renal failure with dialysis.
Nurse swollen limbs in the most comfortable position.

Debride necrotic tissue but avoid fasciotomy unless haemostasis has
been restored and intracompartmenal pressure >40 mmHg .

Snake bites — first aid
reassure the patient (only ~50% of bites by venomous snakes cause
envenoming, which usually takes hours to become serious).
do not interfere with the bite site in any way (e.g. do not attempt
to suck out or aspirate the poison).
immobilize the person as far as possible, especially the bitten
limb.
transport patient to medical care by vehicle, boat, stretcher, etc.
treat pain with paracetamol or codeine tablets (not aspirin or
NSAIDs).
never attempt to catch or kill the snake.
never use traditional methods (tourniquet, incision, suction,
herbs, etc).

20-minute whole blood clotting test
Put 2 ml venous blood into a plain glass test-tube. Leave
undisturbed for 20 minutes, then tip once. If the blood runs out (no
clot), consumption coagulopathy has occurred and antivenom is
indicated. Repeat 6 h after giving antivenom. If the blood remains
incoagulable, give another dose.
If negative, can be repeated hourly if envenoming is suspected.
Recovery will take 6 h after effective administration of antivenom
since de novo synthesis of clotting factors is required.

Pressure-immobilization method
Only for bites by suspected elapids whose venom can cause rapid
paralysis: bind the bitten limb very firmly with long stretchy (crepe)
bandages, from the digits to axilla/groin, incorporating a splint.
Loosen if the limb becomes painful or if the peripheral pulse is
occluded.

Prevention of snake bites
avoid all snakes and snake charmers.
never disturb, corner, attack, or handle snakes — dead or alive.
if a snake is cornered, remain motionless until it has escaped.
never walk in undergrowth or deep sand without proper
leg/footwear.
always carry a light at night.
be careful collecting firewood with bare hands.
never put a hand or push sticks into burrows or holes.
avoid climbing trees or rocks covered with dense foliage.
when climbing, don't put hands on ledges that cannot be seen.
never swim in vegetation-matted rivers or muddy estuaries.
avoid sleeping on the ground use a hammock or camp bed, a tent
with sewn-in ground sheet, or a mosquito net tucked under a
sleeping bag.

Scorpion sting
The most dangerous scorpions inhabit deserts or hot dusty terrains in
North Africa, the Middle East, South Africa, the Americas, and S Asia.
They likely cause more than 100,000 medically significant stings each
year. Most deaths occur in children.

Clinical features:
stings are excruciatingly painful. Systemic symptoms reflect release of
autonomic neurotransmitters: acetylcholine (causing vomiting,
abdominal pain, bradycardia, sweating, salivation) and then
catecholamines (causing hypertension, tachycardia, pulmonary
oedema, and ECG abnormalities).

Management:
for pain, infiltrate local anaesthetic at the site, ideally by digital block

if the sting is on finger or toe. Powerful opiate analgesia may be
required. For systemic envenoming (difficult to distinguish from pain
and fear in children), antivenoms are available for dangerous
African/Middle Eastern and American species. Hypertension, acute left
ventricular failure, and pulmonary oedema may respond to
vasodilators such as prazosin (0.5 mg PO q3-6 h).

Prevention:
scorpions hide in cracks, crevices, and under rubbish. Encourage
people to not walk around in bare feet, to sleep off the ground under a
permethrin-impregnated bed net, and to always shake out boots and
shoes before putting them on.

Spider bite
The most dangerous spiders are the black/brown widows (Latrodectus)
in the Americas, southern Europe, Southern Africa, and Australia;
wandering, armed, or banana spiders (Phoneutria) in Latin America;
funnel web spiders (Atrax and Hadronyche) in Australia; and brown
recluse spiders (Loxosceles) in the Americas. Spiders cause few deaths.

Clinical features:
bites happen when people brush against a spider that has crept into
clothes or bedding. Latrodectus, Phoneutria, and Atrax are neurotoxic
causing cramping abdominal pains, muscle spasms, weakness,
sweating, salivation, gooseflesh, fever, nausea, vomiting, alterations
in pulse rate and blood pressure, and convulsions. Loxosceles is
necrotic. Rarely, Loxosceles cause systemic effects such as fever,
scarlatiniform rash, haemoglobinuria, coagulopathy, and renal failure.

Managment:
is mostly symptomatic. Antivenoms are available in South Africa,
Australia, and Brazil where bites are an important medical problem.

Hymenoptera sting anaphylaxis

Stings by bees (Apidae), wasps, hornets and yellow jackets
(Vespidae), and ants (American fire ants Solenopsis, Australian
jumper ants Myrmecia) are a very common nuisance in most
countries. However, 2-4% of the population become allergic,
developing massive local swelling or potentially lethal anaphylaxis if
stung. In tropical countries, mass attacks by bees and wasp-like
insects are not uncommon. In the Americas, Africanized ‘killer’ bees
have killed many people.

Clinical features:
symptoms of anaphylaxis including urticaria, angioedema, shock,
bronchospasm, and GI symptoms.

Management:
give adrenaline.

Prevention:
desensitization is effective but time-consuming. Self-injectable
adrenaline (‘Epi-Pen’ or ‘Ana-Pen’) is the best first aid.

Fish stings
Stinging fresh and salt water fish (stingrays, cat fish, weevers,
scorpion, and stone fish) have venomous spines on gills, fins, or tail.
Most commonly, they sting when trodden upon on the ocean or river
bed.

Clinical features:
immediate excruciating pain is followed by local swelling and
inflammation. Rare systemic effects include vomiting, diarrhoea,
sweating, dysrhythmia, hypotension, and muscle spasms. Stingrays'
barbed spines can inflict fatal trauma (pneumothorax, penetration of
organs). Spines left embedded in the wound with their venomous
integument will cause infection unless removed.

Management
First aid: agonizing local pain is dramatically relieved by immersing

the stung part in hot (<45°C) but not scalding water which will cause
a full thickness scald. Alternatively, local anaesthetic can be
infiltrated or applied as a digital block.
Antivenom: Australia produces an antivenom for the most dangerous
species stone fish (genus Synanceja).
Infection: all fish wounds can become infected with lethal marine
pathogens including Vibrio vulnificus).

Prevention:
advise people to shuffle or prod the sand ahead of them with a stick to
disturb ground-lurking fish, to avoid handling dead or live fish, and to
keep clear of fish in the water, especially in the vicinity of tropical
reefs. Footwear protects against most species except stingrays.

Jelly fish stings
Common jelly fish (Cnidarians/Coelenterates) that sting include:
Portuguese men o' war (blue bottles), sea wasps, box jellies,
cubomedusoids, sea anemones, and stinging corals. Tentacles are
studded with millions of stinging capsules (nematocysts) that fire their
venomous stinging hairs into the skin on contact. Lines of painful
blisters and inflammation result. Allergy may cause recurrent
urticarial rashes over many months. Notorious Northern Australian and
Indo-Pacific box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri and Chiropsalmus spp.) and
Irukandji (Carukia barnesi) can kill.

Clinical features:
severe musculoskeletal pain, anxiety, trembling, headache,
piloerection, sweating, tachycardia, hypertension, and pulmonary
oedema may evolve.

Management:
remove the victim from the water (prevent drowning). Inhibit
nematocyst discharge by applying commercial vinegar or 3-10%
aqueous acetic acid (ONLY Chironex spp. and other cubozoans including

Irukandji) or a slurry of baking soda and water (50% w/v) (Chrysaora
spp.). Don't use sun tan lotion or alcoholic solutions! Ice packs relieve
pain. Antivenom for C. fleckeri is available in Australia.

Sea urchin stings
Long, sharp, venomous sea urchin (Echinoderm) spines become
deeply embedded in the skin, usually of the sole of the foot, when
the animal is trodden upon.

Management:
soften the skin with salicylic acid ointment and then pare down the
epidermis to a depth at which the spines can be removed with
forceps. Most sea urchin spines are absorbed rapidly provided they
are broken into small pieces in the skin. If they penetrate a joint or
become infected, surgical removal may be necessary.

Introduction
Both the achievements and shortcomings of vaccines in preventing
disease in tropical countries are extraordinary. It is estimated that
more than 2 million childhood deaths were averted by immunization in
2003. The number of polio cases fell by 99% between 1988 and 2005.
The polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines offer the hope of a
‘new wave’ of vaccines with the potential for a dramatic reduction in
diseases such as meningococcus, pneumococcus, and Haemophilus
influenzae type B (Hib).
And yet 1.4 million children died from vaccine-preventable diseases in
2002. In 2004, measles resulted in 454,000 deaths — the majority of
them in children. Many vaccines still require cumbersome mechanisms
such as maintenance of a cold chain and IM injection, with the entire
infrastructure these demand. It is because of the enormous potential
of vaccines that these issues need to be addressed. Initiatives such as
the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) offer the hope
that the populations most in need will benefit from the potential that
vaccinology offers.

Expanded Programme on Immunization

Guidelines of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) for
childhood vaccination are given on
p 811. However, the
epidemiology of the diseases which the EPI aims to combat will differ
between different countries. To reflect this variation, policy needs to
be made at national or regional level to decide which vaccines should
be included in the country's infant and childhood immunization
schedules. These national policies will take precedence over the EPI
guidelines presented here and can be written on
p 809. A summary
of national guidelines can be accessed at the WHO website:

Immunization strategies and schedules
Immunization schedule design

The timings of the vaccines recommended by the EPI are based on a
compromise between:
The desire to immunize as early as possible, thereby protecting the
child before he/she becomes exposed to the infectious agent, and
The requirement to wait both for the infant's immune system to
mature and for maternally-derived antibodies that crossed the
placenta prenatally to wane, so that the immunization will be
effective.
In general, vaccines are recommended for the youngest age group that
is at risk for developing the disease and whose members are able to
receive the vaccine safely and develop an adequate response. Many
vaccines require more than one dose and it is recommended that these
doses be separated by at least 4 weeks. Increasing the intervals
between doses, as is recommended in developed countries, enhances
the immune response to the vaccines but results in the child being
susceptible to the disease for a longer period of time.

Optimization of vaccine uptake
The most common reason for children dying from a vaccinepreventable disease is that they have not received the vaccine.
Optimization of vaccine uptake is crucial and can be facilitated by:
Offering immunizations as often as possible.
Administering all vaccines for which a child is eligible simultaneously
at a single visit.
Routine screening of immunization status of all women and children.
Awareness of true and false contraindications for immunizations (
p 815).
Maintenance of adequate vaccine delivery.
Appropriate utilization of multi-dose vials (

Administration of vaccines

p 812).

Recent data from industrialized countries has highlighted the
importance of using the appropriate needle length (i.e. 25 mm) when
administering intramuscular vaccines in order to reduce reactogenicity
and, potentially, increase immunogenicity. Data addressing this
question in developing countries are not yet available. Intramuscular
vaccines should be administered to infants in the lateral aspect of the
thighs, while children above the age of 12 months should receive their
vaccines in the deltoid muscles. Vaccines administered on the same
limb should be separated by at least 2.5 cm. With the exception of
OPV, if 2 live vaccines (see
p 816) are to be administered, they
should be administered either at the same time or at least 1 month
apart. Due to an increased risk of lymphadenopathy, no vaccine should
be administered into an arm used for BCG administration for 3 months
after receipt of BCG. In the case of an interruption to an immunization
schedule, the schedule should proceed as if no interruption had
occurred i.e. there is no need to ‘restart’ an immunization schedule.

is a highly effective method of controlling neonatal tetanus.
Recommendations vary according to previous immunization status.

Transport and storage of vaccines
The vulnerability to extremes of temperature of the majority of
vaccines used in the EPI schedule means that maintenance of an
adequate ‘cold chain’ (to ensure vaccine transport at optimum

temperatures from manufacture to the point of use) is essential to an
effective immunization programme. To this end, the following
innovations have been introduced:
Cold chain monitor — detects excessive temperatures during
shipment.
Vaccine vial monitor (VVM) — for the cumulative heat exposure of an
individual vial.
Freeze watchTM monitor — for exposure of vaccine shipments to
temperatures below freezing point.
Stop!WatchTM — combining the indicators from the cold chain
monitor and the Freeze watchTM monitor.
Detailed guidance on the use of these devices and the maintenance of
cold chain is available at:
http://www.who.int/vaccines-documents/DoxGen/H5-CC.htm
In order to reduce vaccine wastage, the use of already opened multidose vials at subsequent immunization sessions has been condoned by
the WHO for the following vaccines: OPV, DTP, TT, DT, HepB, and
liquid formulations of Hib. Multi-dose vials of these vaccines can be
used for a period of up to 4 weeks after the opening of the vial
provided that:
The cold chain has been maintained, the VVM has not reached the
‘discard point’, and the vaccines are within their ‘use by’ date.
The rubber vaccine vial septum has not been submerged in water
(e.g. by melting ice).
Aseptic technique has been used to withdraw all doses.

Needle use and disposal
More than 1 billion immunizations are injected annually in developing
countries. Without adequate safety mechanisms, each one of these
episodes creates the potential for transmission of blood-borne
infections to both vaccine recipients (through re-use of disposable

needles) and health care workers (through needle-stick injuries). To
minimize these risks, the WHO advocates:
All immunizations requiring injection be administered via single-use
auto-destruct (AD) needles.
No vaccines are administered without access to safety boxes to
dispose of used needles.
Disposable syringes can be used to reconstitute lyophilized vaccines,
but must not be recapped.
Safety boxes should be sealed when ¾ full.
Disposal of the safety boxes remains problematic in many areas and is
most commonly performed by incineration.

Adverse reactions
Although modern vaccines are extremely safe, some vaccines may lead
to adverse reactions. It is difficult to prove that a vaccination causes a
specific event. Instead, population studies are required to look for an
association between the vaccination and an adverse event (e.g.
clustering of cases after receipt of vaccine or a higher incidence in
vaccinated compared to unvaccinated groups).

Adverse reactions may be caused by
Inappropriate administration: e.g. abscesses after poor mixing of
vaccines or use of non-sterile needles or syringes; disseminated
disease in immunocompromised patients after inappropriate
administration of BCG or measles vaccines.
Properties of the vaccines: e.g. reactions caused by either the
immunizing agent itself or by other components of the vaccine such
as antibiotics, adjuvants, or preservatives.
The immune response to the vaccine: e.g. allergic reactions.

Mild adverse events
are common (e.g. 20-50% of DTP recipients experience mild local

reactions, while 5-15% of measles vaccine recipients experience fever
and rash 6-12 days after immunization). These do not constitute
contraindications to further immunization.

Severe adverse reactions
are extremely rare. Reports of association of DTP with many adverse
events have been made, but comprehensive studies have failed to link
it to almost all of these. Reactions such as febrile convulsions or
anaphylaxis do occasionally occur; however, for all EPI recommended
vaccines, any vaccine-associated adverse events are much less
common than the severe complications caused by the diseases
prevented by the vaccines.

Misconceptions about vaccines
There have always been concerns about the safety of immunization
programmes — this is only appropriate for an intervention in which a
biologically active agent is given to large numbers of healthy children.
Unfortunately, even after a vaccine's safety has been demonstrated,
some misconceptions may persist. Recent examples include concerns
that the oral polio vaccine caused infertility or was responsible for the
spread of HIV infection. The resurgence of polio in regions rejecting
the polio immunization as a result of these erroneous beliefs has
demonstrated the ability of misinformation to undermine
immunization programmes.
More information about common vaccine misconceptions and
information that can be used to reassure parents and community
leaders can be obtained from the WHO at:
www.who.int/immunization_safety/aefi/immunization_misconceptions/en/

Contraindications to vaccination

P.816

There are few absolute contraindications to vaccination. Every
opportunity to vaccinate a child or woman of child-bearing age should
be taken. There is a high risk that delaying vaccination until the child
has recovered from a mild inter-current illness will result in that child
not getting their full complement of vaccinations.

True contraindications to immunization include:
Illnesses severe enough for the child to be hospitalized — if the child
is vaccinated but dies from the pre-existing illness, the vaccine may
be thought (erroneously) to have contributed to the child's death.
However, immunize as soon as the child's general condition
improves.
For live vaccines (see opposite), immunodeficiency diseases, or
immunosuppression due to malignant disease, therapy with
immunosuppressive drugs or irradiation. HIV/AIDS is a special case —
see below.
A severe adverse event (anaphylaxis, collapse or shock, encephalitis,
encephalopathy, or non-febrile convulsions) to a vaccine
contraindicates further doses of that vaccine. If the adverse
reaction occurred following a dose of DTP vaccine, then either omit
the pertussis component and continue with the DT vaccine or use a
vaccine containing acellular pertussis (if available).
For vaccines prepared in egg (e.g. influenza, yellow fever), a history
of anaphylaxis following egg ingestion. Vaccines prepared in chicken
fibroblast cells (e.g. measles, MR, MMR) are safe for such individuals.
In general, live vaccines should not be given to pregnant women and
pregnancy should be avoided for >1 month following immunization.
Immunization in pregnancy may be considered where there is a high
risk of exposure and the need for vaccination outweighs any possible
risk to the foetus (e.g. yellow fever vaccine and OPV).

Immunization of HIV-infected persons
Immunization of HIV +ve persons needs special consideration because
of:
Increased susceptibility of individuals with AIDS to severe illness
from vaccine-preventable infections such as TB and measles.
Impaired response to vaccines in the advanced stages of AIDS (but
most HIV +ve adults and children will mount a good vaccine

response).
Potential risk of live vaccines in immunocompromised individuals
(e.g. disseminated BCG infection following administration of BCG
vaccine).
As a general rule, asymptomatic HIV +ve individuals should receive all
recommended EPI vaccinations as soon as possible, while symptomatic
HIV +ve individuals can receive all immunizations except BCG and
yellow fever (see WHO/UNICEF guidelines opposite). As for any
severely ill child, severely ill HIV +ve children should not be
vaccinated. Children who are at risk of, or have acquired HIV through
vertical transmission should receive the recommended immunizations
at the same ages as other children.

In regions with high rates of TB, BCG vaccine should be given to all infants for whom
there is no known contraindication, including those whose HIV status is unknown due to
limited diagnostic resources. However, in view of reports of disseminated BCG in HIVinfected children, the vaccine should probably be avoided in those who are known to be
HIV infected. Where health services allow, infants of indeterminate status born to HIVinfected mothers should be closely monitored and tested to exclude HIV infection before
BCG vaccine is administered.

IPV can be used as an alternative in symptomatic HIV-infected children.

Because of the risk of severe early measles infection, HIV+ve infants should receive
measles at 6 months and as soon after 9 months as possible.

Pending further studies

EPI recommended vaccines
Always consult the manufacturer's data sheet before using a vaccine.
See
p 815 for general contraindications.

BCG
A freeze-dried preparation of a live attenuated strain of
Mycobacterium bovis given as a single ID injection. Early
administration recommended as it is most effective in preventing TB
meningitis and miliary TB, diseases that are more common in infancy.
The duration of protection beyond 10-15 years is uncertain; booster
doses are not recommended by the WHO. Hypersensitivity should be
excluded by a negative tuberculin skin test if BCG is administered after
the neonatal period. BCG also protects against leprosy.
Contraindications: confirmed HIV or other forms of
immunocompromise. Side-effects: a small swelling forms 2-6 weeks
post vaccination that may progress to a benign ulcer. Local abscesses
may occur, particularly after incorrect administration (e.g. SC rather
than ID). BCG lymphadenitis and osteomyelitis may occur.

Hepatitis B vaccine
A suspension of inactivated hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
adsorbed onto aluminium salts. It is given by intramuscular injection
(as per guidelines on
p 810). Booster doses are not recommended. It
is available both as a recombinant and plasma-derived product — both
are equally safe and effective and can be used interchangeably. The
vaccine is available either as monovalent HepB or in combination with
DTP ± Hib or DTaP ± Hib; only the monovalent vaccine should be used
for immunization at birth. Neonatal vaccination provides
immunoprophylaxis against perinatal infection. The use of hepatitis B
immunoglobulin at birth for prevention of perinatal transmission is not
recommended by WHO.

Pertussis vaccines

Available in 2 forms — whole-cell vaccine (containing killed pertussis
bacteria, commonly used in developing countries) or acellular vaccine
(containing inactivated pertussis toxin in combination with 1-4 other
immunogenic components). Both are given by IM injection, normally as
part of DTP or DTaP vaccine. Primary immunization in infancy is
essential as pertussis mortality occurs predominantly in this age group.
A booster dose is recommended between the ages of 1 to 6 yrs;
duration of protection following this is estimated at 6-12 yrs.
Adolescents and adults can, therefore, be infected and transmit
pertussis to susceptible infants.

Side-effects:
10-50% infants experience mild reactions such as local swelling, fever,
and irritability after whole cell vaccine. Prolonged crying occurs in
<1%; seizures and hypotonic episodes occur much less commonly. These
reactions are less common after acellular pertussis. Following a severe
reaction to DTP, it is appropriate for whole cell pertussis to be omitted
from subsequent immunizations, by using either DT or acellular
pertussis containing combination vaccines. No association between
whole cell pertussis and chronic encephalopathy has been found.

Tetanus toxoid vaccine
A formaldehyde-inactivated preparation of tetanus toxoid adsorbed
onto aluminium salts that can be given by IM or deep SC injection. It is
normally administered to infants as part of DTP (but can be
administered as DT if pertussis is contraindicated).

WHO recommended schedule:
6 doses of vaccine — 3 in infancy, a booster at 4-7 years, another at 1215 years, and a final dose in adulthood. In addition, the administration
of tetanus toxoid to a pregnant woman induces antibodies that can
cross the placenta and prevent neonatal tetanus. The optimal schedule
depends on the immunization history of the woman, as outlined in
Table 22.1. Supplementary mass immunization campaigns are
recommended in countries of high risk for neonatal tetanus and aim to

immunize all women of child-bearing age.

Diphtheria toxoid vaccine
A formaldehyde-inactivated preparation of diphtheria toxin, adsorbed
onto aluminium salts to increase immunogenicity. It is normally given
combined with tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP), but can be given as
DT if pertussis is contraindicated. The vaccine does not prevent
infection but rather inhibits or neutralizes the toxin's effects,
preventing systemic illness. A low-dose vaccine (combined with
tetanus: dT) should be used in individuals >7 yrs to reduce the risk of
reactions to the vaccine.

Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines
Consists of Hib polysaccharides conjugated to diphtheria toxoid,
tetanus toxoids, or the meningocococcus outer-membrane complex in
order to stimulate a T-cell response. The vaccine is given
intramuscularly either alone or in a combination vaccine with DTP ±
HepB. Hib causes a substantial proportion of global meningitis,
septicaemia, and pneumonia. However, the disease burden is often
underestimated due to the difficulty of laboratory identification.
Booster doses of vaccine are currently used in the majority of
industrialized countries, but are not recommended in the EPI schedule.

Japanese encephalitis vaccines
Exist in 3 forms — 2 formalin inactivated vaccines (grown in either
mouse or guinea pig brain) and 1 live attenuated vaccine. The mouse
brain derived vaccine is the only vaccine that is internationally
licensed; the guinea pig derived vaccine is produced in China and is

now being replaced by the live attenuated vaccine. The mouse brain
vaccine is routinely used in many Japanese encephalitis endemic
countries in Asia, with variable immunization schedules. Most
schedules recommend 2 toddler doses administered 2-4 weeks apart,
with up to 2 subsequent booster doses in late childhood. The dose is
0.5 ml (for 1-3-year-olds) or 1 ml (for >3-year-olds). An immunization
schedule of a total of 3 doses (at 0, 7, and 30 days) is recommended for
travellers to endemic regions who will spend extended periods in rural
areas.

Side-effects:
allergic reactions (e.g. urticaria and angio-oedema) occur in ~0.6% of
immunized travellers. As this reaction may be delayed for up to 10
days, it is advised that the last dose of vaccine be given at least 10
days prior to departure. Concern over an association with acute
disseminated encephalomyelopathy has led to the suspension of
routine immunization in Japan; a WHO review did not support such an
association. Difficulties in large-scale production and expense limit the
vaccine's role in large-scale immunization campaigns.
A live attenuated vaccine (SA-14-14-2) with 98.5% effectiveness 1 year
after a single dose has been introduced in China. This vaccine has the
potential for large-scale production at a lower cost than the
inactivated vaccines, and is currently being assessed for international
licensure.

Poliomyelitis vaccine
Available in 2 forms — a live attenuated oral vaccine (OPV, Sabin
vaccine) and an injectable killed virus vaccine (IPV, Salk vaccine).
Both vaccines contain poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. The EPI
recommends OPV because of its low cost, ease of administration,
superiority in conferring intestinal protection, and potential for
infecting household and community contacts, thereby boosting
secondary immunity. Unfounded reports that OPV causes infertility
have resulted in reduced immunization coverage in countries such as
Nigeria, with a resultant increase in poliomeyelitis.

Cautions:
patients with diarrhoea and vomiting require a further dose after
recovery. IPV rather than OPV should be administered to
immunocompromised individuals and their household contacts.

Side effects:
OPV-associated poliomyelitis is extremely rare: 2-4 cases per million
doses.

Measles vaccine
A live attenuated virus given by IM or SC injection. Measles may be
given as a monovalent vaccine or in combination with rubella ± mumps
(MR, MMR). It is normally given at 9 months of age but can be given at
6 and 9 months to those at high risk and should be offered to
susceptible children within 3 days of exposure to infection. All children
should receive 2 doses of measles vaccine.

Side-effects:
a mild measles-like illness may occur in 5-15% of children 6-12 days
after immunization. Convulsions and encephalitis are rare
complications.

Yellow fever vaccine
Consists of a freeze-dried preparation of live attenuated virus strain
(17D strain) that is grown in egg embryos and given by SC injection.
Yellow fever is endemic in 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (where by
far the greatest burden of disease lies) and 11 countries in South
America. In these countries, infant immunization at the same time as
measles immunization is recommended. Protection afforded by a single
dose of vaccine appears to last at least 30 years. However,
international travel regulations require evidence of immunization
within the previous 10 years prior to arrival in endemic countries (or
travel from endemic countries to countries at risk for endemic
disease).

Contraindications:
anaphylactic reaction to egg, immunocompromise, and age <6 months
(but can be given at 6-8 months if at high risk of disease).

Side-effects:
minor reactions (e.g. headache, myalgia) occur in 10-30% of recipients.
Uncommon reactions include encephalitis (more common in infants),
hypersensitivity, and multiple organ failure (~1 in 10 million, but
possibly more common in elderly).

Other vaccines
Cholera vaccine
The parenteral cholera vaccine has poor efficacy and is no longer
recommended. Two oral cholera vaccines have been developed: one is
a killed whole-cell vaccine combined with a recombinant B subunit of
cholera toxin (rCTB-WC), the other a live attenuated vaccine (CVD 103HgR; not currently in production). The rCTB-WC dosing schedule is 2
doses 1 week apart in adults and 3 half doses 1 week apart in children
2-6 years of age. The vaccine is not licensed for children <2 years of
age. The immunization course should ideally be completed 1 week
before potential exposure to cholera. A booster dose is recommended
by the manufacturers after 2 years (for adults) and after 6 months (for
children aged 2-6 years). The WHO recommends that cholera vaccine
be used pre-emptively in populations at risk of cholera epidemics (e.g.
refugee camps), along with other cholera preventative measures.
Travel immunization is only recommended for relief and disaster
workers, or travellers to remote areas in which epidemics are
occurring. rCTB-WC does not protect against Vibrio cholerae 0139, an
emerging serotype in South Asia.

Side-effects:
rCTB-WC is well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal symptoms being

the most common side-effect.

Hepatitis A vaccines
Exist in 5 variations; 4 inactivated and 1 live attenuated (produced and
used only in China). Antibodies persist for at least 2 years after a single
dose of inactivated vaccine. However, current recommendations
suggest these vaccines are administered as 2 doses 6-18 months apart.
No vaccine is licensed for use in infants <1-year-old. Hepatitis A
vaccine is also available combined with Hepatitis B vaccine in a
formulation to be administered as 3 doses as a 0, 1, and 6-month
schedule. The high prevalence of hepatitis A in developing countries
results in a predominance of asymptomatic childhood infections.
Therefore, these vaccines are not recommended for use in these
settings. Travellers from industrialized countries to these regions
should be immunized.

Side-effects:
the vaccines are well tolerated and no serious adverse effects have
been attributed to the vaccine.

Influenza vaccines
Consist of 3 inactivated influenza virus strains (2 influenza A, 1
influenza B) that have been grown in eggs. The haemagglutinin (H) and
neuraminidase (N) antigens used in the vaccines are determined by the
WHO each year according to the anticipated prevalent strains. In
addition, H5N1 vaccines are currently being developed in preparation
for the potential of pandemic influenza associated with H5N1 strains.

Meningococcal vaccines
Two forms of meningococcal vaccines exist. The plain polysaccharide
vaccines consist of the serogroup specific meningococcal
polysaccharide capsules. These are available either as themonovalent
serogroup A vaccine
or as combination vaccines i.e. A and C; A, C, and W-135; or A, C, Y,

and W-135. These vaccines are used in outbreak control. However,
protection wanes after several years and, for serogroups other than
serogroup A, are poorly immunogenic in infants.
Glyco-conjugate meningococcal vaccines are available in which
meningococcal polysaccharide capsules are conjugated to tetanus
toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or CRM-197 (a diphtheria toxoid variant).
Monovalent serogroup C glyco-conjugate vaccines are routinely used in
many industrialized countries. The vaccine is given as 2 or 3 infant
doses or a single dose at 1 year of age; a booster dose is required after
infant immunization. A tetravalent meningococcal serogroup A, C, W135, and Y vaccine is recommended in the USA for young people >11
years of age and for ‘at risk’ groups. Development of affordable
glycoconjugate vaccines for prevention of serogroup A disease in subSaharan Africa is ongoing.
The poor immunogenicity of the meningococcal serogroup B
polysaccharide capsule renders this unsuitable for use in a glycoconjugate vaccine. An outbreak-specific meningococcal serogroup B
vaccine, based on subcapsular proteins, is used in New Zealand, but is
not suitable for use elsewhere. Development of a more broadly
protective meningococcal serogroup B vaccine is ongoing.

Mumps vaccine
Consists of a live attenuated strain of the virus grown in chick embryo
cells in chick culture. It is normally given by IM injection with measles
and rubella vaccines in the MMR triple vaccine at 12-15 months and
again at 3-5 years.

Pigbel vaccine
An inactivated preparation of toxin from Clostridium perfringens type
3 that is given by IM injection. It is effective in infants and has been
given routinely to children in Papua New Guinea at 2, 4, and 6 months
of age since 1980. Protection lasts for 2-4 years.

Pneumococcal vaccines

Like meningococcal vaccines, these exist in 2 forms. The plain
polysaccharide vaccine contains capsular polysaccharide antigens from
23 different serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Unfortunately,
these antigens do not induce a protective response in children <2 years
of age and protective immunity in older individuals may be limited or
short-lived. The vaccine is recommended for those >2 years of age who
are at high risk for severe infection: sickle cell disease, chronic renal
failure, immunosuppression, CSF leaks, HIV infection, asplenia,
diabetes mellitus or chronic liver, heart or lung disease. If possible, the
vaccine should be given >2 weeks before either splenectomy or
chemotherapy. Contraindications: pregnancy, breastfeeding, during
acute infection. Side-effects: hypersensitivity reactions may occur.
These are more common following re-immunization within 3 years.
The 7 valent pneumococcal glyco-conjugate vaccine (a conjugate of
the polysaccharide from 7 pneumococcal serotypes with CRM 197) is
immunogenic in infancy and induces immunological memory. In the
USA, a 75% decline in invasive pneumococcal disease in children less
than 5 years of
age was observed in the 4 years following the vaccine's introduction
into the routine immunization schedule in 1999. The vaccine is given
as 2 or 3 primary doses in infancy followed by a booster dose at ~1 year
of age. Two doses 2 months apart are recommended in older children.
Vaccines of higher valency (including serotype 1; a major cause of
disease in many developing countries) are in development. Studies in
sub-Saharan Africa revealing pneumococcal bacteraemia in
597/100,000 of under-5-year-olds presenting to hospital, and a clinical
trial in the Gambia of a 9 valent pneumococcal vaccine showing a 16%
reduction in mortality in pneumococcal vaccine recipients, highlight
the enormous potential of these vaccines if they can be made
affordable for the developing world.

Rabies vaccine
Available as a freeze-dried inactivated preparation of virus grown in
either sheep brain or cultured human diploid cells. The former vaccine
is still used but, due to immune responses to sheep brain antigens that
contaminate the vaccine, is associated with unacceptably high rate of

severe neurological complications (~1:1000). The cultured vaccine is
far safer but more expensive. Its use around the world is increasing,
however, particularly as novel cheaper ways of administering the
vaccine (e.g. by intradermal injection) are developed.

Rotavirus vaccines
Two live oral vaccines have recently been licensed against this virus,
responsible for up to a half of diarrhoea-related hospital admissions in
Africa. A live attenuated vaccine (RIX 4414) has been licensed for use
in Latin America and Europe. This vaccine is administered at 6-14
weeks of age, with a second dose at least 4 weeks later. A re-assortant
vaccine based on a bovine rotavirus strain and incorporating capsid
proteins for 5 common human serotypes has been licensed in the USA.
This vaccine is administered as 3 doses commencing at 6-10 weeks of
age and given at 4-10 week intervals. Large-scale studies of both
vaccines have shown both to be safe and highly effective against
severe rotavirus disease. Importantly, neither vaccine has been shown
to be associated with intussusception, a side-effect that was
responsible for the withdrawal of an earlier rotavirus vaccine
(Rotashield).

Rubella vaccine:
A preparation of the live Wistar strain of the virus. It is given by deep
SC or IM injection in industrialized countries, either as part of the
triple MMR vaccine or as a monovalent vaccine to girls between 10 and
14 years of age. The purpose is to reduce the incidence of primary
infection in pregnant women and, thus, reduce the incidence of
congenital rubella syndrome in their offspring. Universal
recommendation is not recommended by EPI at present as incomplete
immunization is likely to increase the age at which infections occur,
thereby increasing the risk of infection in childbearing women.
Contraindications: avoid immunizing women in early pregnancy. Advise
women to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following immunization.
However, there is no evidence at present that the vaccine is
teratogenic.

The future of vaccines in tropical countries

P.826

Funding initiatives
As a result of increasing recognition of the cost effectiveness of
vaccine programmes, new funding initiatives have been developed to
realize the potential of immunization in tropical and developing
countries. Most prominent among these is GAVI (the Global Alliance for
Vaccines and Immunizations). This alliance between key immunization
stakeholders such as developing and donor governments, the World
Bank, the WHO, UNICEF, the pharmaceutical industry, research
institutes, non-government organizations, and the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation (one of the major funders) has brought focus and
unprecedented resources to the goal of optimizing immunization
uptake and the development of new vaccines.
Further information is available at:
www.who.int/immunization_supply/financing/en/

Vaccine specific initiatives
Funded in part by GAVI, new vaccine-specific advocacy groups have
been developed to promote the introduction of existing vaccines in
developing countries. Examples include The Hib Initiative and
PneumoADIP, the latter being an advocacy group for the pneumococcal
glyco-conjugate vaccines. A primary role of organizations such as these
is the gathering of accurate data on the (often hidden) disease burden
due to the relevant organism. These data can then be used in arguing
for vaccine introduction to health care policy makers.

New vaccines — under development and required
While 1.4 million of the global childhood deaths in 2002 were vaccine
preventable, many more were due to infectious diseases that are not
yet vaccine preventable, but may one day become so. More vaccines,
including those against the diseases listed below, are required and are
currently in development:

Dengue.
Enterotoxigenic E. coli.
Hepatitis C.
HIV (www.iavi.org).
Malaria (www.malariavaccine.org).
Meningococcal serogroup B.
Para-influenza virus.
Respiratory syncitial virus.
Shigella.
Schistosomiasis.
Similarly, work is ongoing to develop alternative, more effective
vaccines against diseases such as TB, for which sub-optimal vaccines
already exist.

Typhoid vaccine
3 forms of typhoid vaccines are currently licensed: a killed parenteral
whole-cell vaccine (now largely superseded due to its reactogenicity),
a plain polysaccharide (‘Vi’) parenteral vaccine, and a live attenuated
oral vaccine. The polysaccharide vaccine is administered as a single
dose by IM or SC injection and is immunogenic above the age of 2
years. Duration of protection is uncertain, however booster doses are
recommended every 3 years. The live attenuated vaccine requires 3
oral doses administered 2 days apart (travellers from the USA are
advised to have a fourth dose). In addition to the enteric coated
capsule formulation of the vaccine (licensed for use only over the age
of 6), a liquid preparation is now available, suitable for use from the
age of 2 upwards. Re-immunization is recommended every 3 years for
those living in endemic regions. Antibiotics and proguanil should be
avoided during the three days before and after vaccination as they will
inactivate the vaccine; similarly, avoid mefloquine for 12 h (and
preferably 3 days) either side of immunization.

A vaccine consisting of the Vi polysaccharide conjugated to a carrier
protein is currently in development and offers hope for vaccine
protection of those under 2 years of age.

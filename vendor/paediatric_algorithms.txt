Publication of any book is a process as laborious as the process of delivering a baby. Maturity (contents and the quality),
weight gain (number of pages), and intact survival (final copy) all have to be carefully looked after. More so for a book with
156 chapters running in 19 sections with every chapter having at least one algorithm!
Algorithms in Pediatrics have gone through all these laborious processes and have come out as an exclusive book
for pediatricians, giving instant guidelines for treatment, bringing uniformity in management, and training minds for
protocolized thinking. With each protocol, the book provides concise, precise, and up-to-date information which shall help
standardize care in pediatric practice.
When a practitioner is confronted with a clinical problem, he can rarely turn to a textbook for help. What he needs at
that time is not a recounting of a long list of differential diagnosis, but practical guidelines as to how to arrive at a particular
diagnosis and how to proceed further.
This book on algorithms intends to enable the pediatrician to recognize many disorders in a simplified manner and give
practical suggestions in their management, a learning experience in a structured manner.
To put it in the words of Henry David Thoreau, “Our lives are frittered away by detail; simplify, simplify”.
Practicing pediatricians are often faced with clinical problems for which they have been rather inadequately trained
during their medical curriculum. Textbooks published from the medically advanced countries do not focus enough
attention on the prevailing problems and circumstances in the developing countries such as India. The algorithms in this
book have been formed keeping in mind the situations prevailing in India, especially the constraints under which the
clinicians here have to practice. The main emphasis has been to provide clear-cut guidelines as to how to make a diagnosis
on clinical grounds with minimal investigations and to choose the most rational therapy.
Although, prepared specifically to meet the needs of practicing doctors or those who intend to practice in near future,
even pediatric residents would find the book extremely useful while preparing for their viva voce at the diploma or MD
exams. The book covers most of those aspects which are practically never taught in the curriculum but are nevertheless
expected to be known by pediatric postgraduates. It will also assist the students, house officers, and clinicians in the
evaluation of common pediatric signs and symptoms in clinical practice.
With the help of history, focused examination, and minimum investigations, pediatricians in office practice can reach a
working diagnosis and lay down immediate priorities in management.

Algorithms in Pediatrics

There is rarely a single acceptable approach to any given problem, and not all diagnoses can fit neatly into an algorithm.
Even though the protocols cannot be considered all-inclusive, the goal is to facilitate a logical and efficient stepwise
approach to reasonable differential diagnoses for the common clinical problems. The algorithmic format provides a rapid
and concise stepwise approach to a diagnosis. Moreover, it would train the brain to approach a problem.
The explosion of knowledge in pediatrics is phenomenal and fast. If the medical advances and good clinical practice get
coupled with effective advocacy, our increasing knowledge will benefit child care in our country.
I am sure that the algorithms will enhance the capabilities of pediatricians, guiding them towards optimal utilization of
available investigative and therapeutic resources.

Preface

It gives us immense pleasure to present to you the 1st edition of “Algorithms in Pediatrics”. Pediatrics is rapidly advancing
with the growth of its subspecialties. At times, it becomes difficult for busy pediatricians, whether in practice, in teaching
institutions, or pursuing their postgraduation, to read through lengthy texts of different subspecialties. Keeping this in
mind, we thought of bringing forth this concise book on algorithms, which deals with common and practical topics of
everyday requirements in different pediatric specialties.
The book has been designed with a practical approach in mind, with an algorithm for each topic, along with a concise
text to use the algorithms. The text has been kept simple and easily comprehendible. The book can be consulted rapidly in
the emergency room, wards, outpatient departments, or in busy clinics.
The book contains 19 subspecialty sections, with 8–10 chapters in each, a total of 156 chapters. This was an immense
work, which could not have been possible without the help and coordination of the section editors. We are very thankful
to all the section editors.
A large number of luminaries and experts in the field of pediatrics and its subspecialties have contributed their mind
and might in bringing out this book. We are thankful to all these contributors.
We are also thankful to Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd. for publishing this book.
We are also grateful to our respective spouses for being tolerant and supportive of us in this endeavor.

Neonatal Resuscitation
Rhishikesh P Thakre

INTRODUCTION
Birth of newborn is a potential medical emergency. Up to half
of newborns who require resuscitation have no identifiable
risk factors before birth. Preparation and anticipation is the
key. All babies need assessment for resuscitation at birth. Up
to 10% of babies need some resuscitation and less than 1%
need major resuscitation.

STANDARD PRECAUTIONS
All resuscitation should be conducted under strict asepsis.
All resuscitation apparatus should be clean and sterile,
and where indicated, disposable. Suction catheters, mucus
extractor, umbilical catheters, syringes, needles, endotracheal
(ET) tubes, feeding tubes should be single use, sterile, and
disposable.

PREPARATION PRIOR TO BIRTH
Equipment Check
•
•
•

All equipment should be available in various sizes for
different gestation
A checklist should be used to ensure that the equipment is
functional
Following equipment are “desirable” for resuscitation:
compressed air, blender, continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP), pulse oximeter + probe and plastic wrap.

Personnel
•

•

ch-01.indd 1

At every delivery, there should be at least one person whose
primary responsibility is the baby and who is capable of
initiating resuscitation positive pressure ventilation (PPV)
and chest compression (CC). Skilled personnel for complete
resuscitation be readily available, if needed
Two persons or more are required in “high risk” delivery.

Identifying High Risk Delivery
Focused questions (help prepare and anticipate problems
during resuscitation) include: (1) What is the gestational
age? (2) Is the amniotic fluid clear? (3) How many babies are
expected? (4) Are there any additional risk factors?

ASSESSMENT AT BIRTH
Need for resuscitation can generally be identified by a rapid
assessment by asking “Is the infant breathing or crying?” If the
baby is breathing or crying, the newborn does not require any
further resuscitation. Early skin-to-skin contact with mother
be practiced and newborn assessed for breathing, color, and
activity.
If the baby is not breathing or crying, a series of steps may be
needed to establish breathing sequentially performing initial
steps, PPV, CC, intubation, and/or administration of drugs.
Assessing the breathing is by observing the baby’s chest
movements. Breathing is adequate if a baby is vigorously
crying or has good regular chest movements with no pauses
or indrawing with associated good tone. Gasping or labored
breathing should not be mistaken for normal breathing.

CORD CLAMPING
All babies who establish spontaneous respiration at birth
should have cord clamping delayed for more than 1 minute.
It is a safe procedure in term, preterm, and low birth weight
(LBW) babies with improved iron status, higher blood pressures
during stabilization, and a lower incidence of intraventricular
hemorrhage (IVH) and fewer blood transfusions in preterms.

STEPS IN NEONATAL RESUSCITATION
A baby who is not breathing or crying at birth should undergo
following steps of resuscitation with ongoing assessment and
reassessment at every step (Algorithm 1).

Section 1: Neonatology
Algorithm 1
Indian Academy of Pediatrics Neonatal Resuscitation Program First Golden Minute algorithm for neonatal resuscitation

*In meconium stained depressed neonates after oral suction, endotracheal suction may be considered.
#Endotracheal intubation may be considered at several steps.
CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure, HR, heart rate; ET, endotracheal; IV, intravenous; NICU, neonatal intensive care unit.

Initial Steps
A baby who is not breathing or crying should be received in
dry, prewarmed cloth with immediate cord clamping and
placed under a heat source. The head, trunk, and the limbs
should be dried firmly and quickly. Suction of mouth followed
by nose may be done if there is obvious obstruction to airway.
Stimulation is done by rubbing the back or flicking the soles.
The newborn is repositioned and simultaneous assessment of
respiration and heart rate (HR) is done.
Response to resuscitation is best judged by increasing HR
and later by establishment of spontaneous breathing. The HR
is easiest and quickest assessed by palpating at the base of
umbilical cord, but auscultation of precordium is most reliable.

Positive Pressure Ventilation

2

ch-01.indd 2

Positive pressure ventilation is indicated if the newborn has
apnea or gasping respiration, HR less than 100 beats per
minute or SpO2 below target values despite supplemental
oxygen being increased to 100%. A flow-inflating bag, a selfinflating bag, or a pressure-limited T-piece resuscitator can
be used for PPV. Call for help and ask assistant to apply pulse
oximeter, if available, to right hand/wrist of the newborn. In
all newborns (term or preterm), PPV should be started with
room air. Provide breaths at a rate of 40–60 per minute using
“breathe–two-three” and assess for efficacy after 5–10 breaths.
Check for rise in HR and oximetry. If there is no HR rise, check

for air entry and chest movement. If not, take corrective
measures for ventilation—mask reposition, reposition airway,
suction, open mouth and ventilate, pressure increase, and
consider alternate airway measures (MRSOPA). Heart rate is
assessed every 30 seconds. Consider inserting orogastric tube
if ventilation is prolonged.
Positive pressure ventilation is discontinued if there
is rise in HR greater than 100 beats per minute and onset of
spontaneous respiration. If despite adequate PPV, there is no
desired response, one may consider intubation or initiate CC if
HR is less than 60 beats per minute.

Intubation
Intubation is considered if ventilation is ineffective, newborn
is nonvigorous with meconium stained liquor, need for CC,
administration of drugs, or suspected congenital diaphragmatic
hernia. Intubation is performed in time limit of 30 seconds.
There is no role of cuffed ET tubes. Two common and serious
errors of ET intubation are malplacement of the ET tube and
the use of the wrong sized tubes.

Chest Compression
Heart rate less than 60 beats per minute despite adequate
ventilation is indication to start CC. One should ensure
that assisted ventilation is being delivered optimally before
starting CCs. Consider intubation if CC is to begin. The

2 thumb encircling hands technique may generate higher
peak systolic and coronary perfusion pressure than the 2 finger
technique, hence the 2 thumb encircling hands technique is
recommended for performing CCs in newly born infants. The
2 finger method should be reserved only for brief applications
while an emergent umbilical venous catheter is established
and then should be converted back to the 2 thumb method. A
ratio of three CC to one ventilation is delivered in 2 seconds
for uninterrupted 45–60 seconds compressing the 1/3
anteroposterior diameter of the chest and HR is checked every
45–60 seconds.
If the HR less than 60 beats per minute, CC with intubation
is continued with administration of adrenaline; if the HR
is 60–100 beats per minute, CC is stopped and ventilation
continued and if the HR is greater than 100 beats per minute
with spontaneous breathing, PPV is discontinued.

Medications
Bradycardia in the newborn infant is usually the result of
inadequate lung inflation or profound hypoxemia, and
establishing adequate ventilation is the most important step to
correct it. Medications are indicated if the HR is less than 60
beats per minute despite 45–60 seconds of adequate CC and
ventilation. The preferred mode of drug delivery is umbilical
venous route. Epinephrine is administered in 1:10,000
concentration at dose of 0.1–0.3 mL/kg, IV (ET: 0.5–1 mL/
kg) as fast as possible. Heart rate is assessed after 1 minute of
adrenaline administration.
Volume expanders, normal saline or ringer lactate,
10 mL/kg over 5–10 minutes may be administered if there is
no response to resuscitation and signs of poor peripheral
perfusion or history suggestive of blood loss. There is no role of
naloxone in delivery room. Endotracheal drug administration
does not give reliable effects.

PRETERM RESUSCITATION
Additional personnel and equipment are required. Preterm/
LBW babies not requiring resuscitation at birth can be kept
on mother’s chest in skin-to-skin contact for thermoregulation.
Ensure the area is preheated using a warmer or portable pad.
Food grade, clean, plastic wrapping may be done before drying
in less than 32 weeks’ gestation as soon as the baby is born to
ensure thermal care. If preterm is breathing spontaneously
with labored respiration or is cyanotic or low SpO2, consider
initiating CPAP. Gentle handling, avoiding head-down position,
avoiding excess pressures of PPV or CPAP, administering
surfactant after stabilization, using pulse oximeter as a
guide to oxygenation and avoiding rapid infusions are good
resuscitation practices.

Role of Oxygen
Need for oxygen is based on oximetry. Pulse oximeter
working on a “signal extraction technique” that is designed
to reduce movement artifact with a neonatal probe is ideal.
Administration of supplementary oxygen should be regulated
by blending oxygen and air, and the concentration delivered
is guided by oximetry. Healthy infants born at term may take
more than 10 minutes to achieve a preductal oxygen saturation
greater than 95% and nearly 1 hour to achieve postductal
saturation greater than 95%. If the saturation is less than
desired, start supplemental oxygen. Use 100% oxygen if the
newborn needs CC. Minute specific oxygen saturation targets
for newborns are provided in table 1.

Pneumothorax
Transillumination using a cold light source may be used for
diagnosing pneumothorax bedside, if facility exists. In absence
of cold light source, use a butterfly with a three way and syringe
to tap in the second intercostal space on the suspected side.

Therapeutic Hypothermia
Currently, therapeutic hypothermia is not defined as
standard of care in India. However, if facility exists, such
therapy may be used but only after taking informed consent
from parents.

Resuscitation of Babies
Outside Hospital/Home Delivery
Special attention should be paid to maintaining normal
temperature of the baby by closing the windows to prevent
draughts, use dry warm cloth, baby cap, and skin-to-skin
contact. Resuscitation can also be performed keeping baby on
mother’s abdomen. Baby should be transferred to facility in
skin-to-skin contact with mother.

To Resuscitate or Not
The decision of when not to resuscitate or how much to
resuscitate is complex. Such decisions are best made with

spontaneous circulation within 10 minutes
• Use of pulse oximetry is desirable in following conditions:
anticipated need for resuscitation, positive pressure ventilation,
supplemental oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure,
evaluation of cyanosis
• Free-flow oxygen can be delivered by holding tube near the
nostrils, using face mask and flow-inflating bag. It cannot be
delivered by self-inflating bag.

Apnea
Naveen Jain

INTRODUCTION
Apnea is a common problem in clinical practice of pediatricians
managing preterm babies. It is a symptom of serious concern
as timely intervention may be necessary to prevent death/
serious hypoxia and associated morbidities. Many apnea
events or a single serious apnea event may lead the clinician to
investigate extensively and initiate empirical therapies ranging
from antibiotics to treatment for reflux. A clinical approach
guideline may optimize interventions.
Cessation of breathing lasting long enough (defined as
>20 seconds, but time never measured in clinical practice!) to
cause hypoxia (saturation <80%), bradycardia [heart rate (HR)
<100 beats per minute] or poor perfusion or poor tone.

CLINICAL EVALUATION
Apnea is always a life-threatening emergency and treatment
(resuscitation) precedes evaluation. In practice, good obser­
vation is possible only after resuscitation. Classical descrip­tion
of apnea has been central/obstructive and mixed based on
whether baby is breathing or not at the time of apnea.
However, it is more useful to classify babies as:
• Well preterm baby with apnea: possibly apnea of
prematurity (AOP)
• Sick baby with apnea: one who has low saturations and
needs oxygen to saturate even after effective breathing
is established and has either poor sensorium or tone,
poor perfusion, abnormalities of glucose, temperature
instability, or feed intolerance. Apnea in this circumstance
is usually secondary to a cause, i.e., symptomatic apnea
and needs specific investigation and treatment.
Apnea of prematurity needs only stimulation of respiratory
center with xanthines. Symptomatic apnea may also benefit
with the xanthines/continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/
nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation (NIMV), but treatment
of primary cause is more important. Recurrent and severe apnea
may require intubation and ventilation in both situations.

ch-02.indd 5

Clinical Pearls
• Is the baby completely well after the apnea (apnea of
prematurity likely)
• Or does the baby still need oxygen to saturate, has poor
sensorium or activity, hypo-/hyperthermia, poor perfusion,
abnormal sugars—look for a cause and treat.

Common Causes Of Apnea
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Pneumonia, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis
Central causes: perinatal asphyxia, seizures, birth trauma,
meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage [intraventricular
hemorrhage (IVH), subdural hemorrhage], periventri­cular
leukomalacia (PVL), and hydrocephalus
Hypoglycemia
Dyselectrolytemia: hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypo­
kalemia
Anemia
Hypo- and hyperthermia
Airway obstruction
Drug toxicity, e.g., phenobarbitone
Cardiac causes: patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

Differential Diagnosis
•
•
•

Periodic breathing (cessation of breathing with no cyanosis
or bradycardia)
Subtle seizures
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

INVESTIGATIONS
Based on the expected cause, investigations should be planned:
• Blood sugar, serum electrolytes, and serum calcium
• Sepsis screen including blood culture
• Hemoglobin for anemia

Use of caffeine in babies less than 1,250 g or less than
28 weeks of gestation has been shown to decrease
bronchopulmonary dysplasia and survival with
better neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months
of corrected age. There is no role of prophylactic use
of either aminophylline or caffeine in the prevention
of AOP. Caffeine may have action for days after
stopping, and babies must be monitored in hospital for
recurrence of apnea for 5–7 days after stopping caffeine

Clinical Pearls
• Caffeine/aminophylline may decrease incidence and severity
of apnea episodes; this must not delay investigating for a
cause or planning for continuous positive airway pressure/
ventilation
• Aminophylline is similar in effectiveness; close monitoring
for tachycardia and feed intolerance may be required (most
centers are not monitoring drug levels in India) if cost limits
use of caffeine.

Continuous positive airway pressure: continuous positive
airway pressure should be used in apnea if xanthines fail.
Continuous positive airway pressure is the preferred mode
of treatment if baby has retractions or need for oxygen in
addition to apnea. Postextubation CPAP reduces chances
of extubation failure due to apnea
High flow nasal cannula: flow of gases greater than 2 L/min
produces CPAP like benefit. The mixture of air and oxygen
should be warmed and humidified
Noninvasive ventilation with nasal prongs in the form of
NIMV and synchronized NIMV
Intubation and ventilation: if the baby has frequent apnea

should be considered

Respiratory Distress in Newborn
Reeta Bora

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory distress is a common problem in newborn and
is encountered in almost 6–7% of neonates. The clinical
presentation of respiratory distress in the newborn includes
tachypnea (respiratory rate of >60 breaths per min), retraction
of chest (intercostals, subcostal, or supraclavicular), grunting,
cyanosis, inspiratory stridor, and nasal flaring. However,
conventionally, presence of any two out of retraction, grunt,
and tachypnea is defined as respiratory distress. There are
many conditions in newborn which can lead to respiratory
distress and many of them are preventable. Some of them last
for few hours only while some may be persistent and if not
managed urgently, may lead to death. Early recognition and
management is necessary to prevent mortality and to decrease
morbidity.

APPROACH TO A NEONATE
WITH RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
History
A detailed good history is very important to come to a diagnosis.
It is important to know if the baby is a term (>37 completed
weeks of gestational age) or a preterm baby (<37 weeks of
gestation). If preterm, the exact gestational age helps us to
assess the risk of RDS or hyaline membrane disease. It is
important to know in case of preterm baby whether antenatal
steroid has been received or not. If there is history of prolonged
rupture of membrane, congenital pneumonia should be
suspected. History of diabetes mellitus in mother in a preterm,
late preterm, or term baby may be indicator of hyaline
membrane disease; similarly, history of meconium stained
liquor with poor Apgar score and distress soon after birth
would indicate MAS. The importance of determining the time
of onset of distress needs to be emphasized, as this may vary
depending upon the etiology. Respiratory distress syndrome,
TTNB, and MAS are some conditions which would present in a
neonate soon after birth. If feeding problems are present, such
as choking or aspiration during a feed, and distress occurred
after some duration after birth, aspiration pneumonia may
be thought of as a cause. Congenital heart disease usually

11/18/2016 4:56:45 PM

Chapter 3: Respiratory Distress in Newborn
manifests with symptoms like respiratory distress after some
duration after birth; acquired pneumonias will also manifest
later than 48 hours after birth.

Clinical Examination
The neonate should then be assessed for severity of
respiratory distress, any associated neurological signs like
level of alertness, bulged fontanelle, tone anomaly, etc. One
should also look for any signs suggestive of cardiac problem
like prolonged capillary refill time, poor pulse volume, a
hepatomegaly, presence of any murmur, and any abnormality
in blood pressure. Any signs indicating presence of sepsis
should be looked for. If malformations are present in any
part of body, it may indicate a surgical cause or a cardiac
cause as the possibility for respiratory distress. Excessive
frothing with inability to pass a feeding tube may indicate
presence of tracheoesophageal fistula while deterioration of
a baby on bag and mask ventilation and associated scaphoid
shape of abdomen would indicate presence of diaphragmatic
hernia. In a dehydrated baby, metabolic acidosis may be the
cause. History of meconium stained liquor, and on clinical
examination, meconium staining of nails, skin, umbilicus, etc.
with a hyperinflated chest would indicate MAS.

Clinical Pearl
• A detailed history and clinical examination is very important to
find the cause of respiratory distress in a newborn.

The Downes’ score is commonly used for assessing severity
of respiratory distress objectively in a newborn as well as to
assess whether baby is improving or deteriorating later on
(Table 1).
A score of 6 or more indicates severe respiratory distress
and impending failure with need for respiratory support. A
score of less than 6 indicates respiratory distress and may
indicate oxygen supplementation with a hood and a score
of 4–6 indicates moderate respiratory distress with need for
support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

neutrophil count, estimation of C-reactive protein level, band
cell count and micro-erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and
blood culture needs to be done. Shake test should be done
if RDS is suspected. Shake test is a simple bedside test and
should be done in preterm babies with respiratory distress,
especially if there is no history of administration of antenatal
steroid. The gastric aspirate (0.5 mL) is mixed with 0.5 mL of
absolute alcohol in test tube. This is shaken for 15 seconds
and allowed to stand for 15 minutes. A negative shake test,
i.e., no bubbles or bubbles covering less than one-third of the
rim indicates a high risk of developing RDS and the presence
of bubbles at more than two-third of the rim indicates lung
maturity and decreased risk of developing RDS. A chest
X-ray helps to differentiate different conditions like RDS,
TTNB, MAS, pneumonia, and different surgical conditions
like tracheoesophageal fistula and diaphragmatic hernia
(Figs 1 to 5). Cardiomegaly in chest X-ray may indicate cardiac
abnormality as a cause of respiratory distress. An arterial blood
gas (ABG) helps further in establishing diagnosis.

MANAGEMENT (Algorithm 1)
General Management
Irrespective of cause, the principles of supportive therapy
for respiratory distress in newborn is same and crucial in
all. All babies with respiratory distress would need constant
monitoring. The parameters to be monitored to find whether
baby is improving or deteriorating with any indication for
respiratory support are the respiratory rate, presence of
grunting, chest indrawing, or any episode of apnea. Babies
should be assessed for Downes’ score at intervals to access
improvement or deterioration. Monitoring should be

Investigations
Based on probable diagnosis reached after thorough history
and clinical examination, investigations need to be planned to
confirm diagnosis. If history of prolonged rupture of membrane
is present in a neonate with respiratory distress, sepsis screen
which includes estimation of total leukocyte count, absolute

Fig. 2: Chest X-ray showing hyperinflation of lung fields, bilateral
streaky opacities radiating from hilum and fluid in the horizontal
fissure of right lung suggestive of transient tachypnea of newborn.
Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign condition usually
seen in term babies born by cesarean section. These babies are well
and have only tachypnea with rates as high as 80–100breaths per
minute. The breathing is shallow and rapid without any significant
chest retractions. It occurs because of delayed clearance of lung fluid.
Management is supportive and prognosis is excellent.

asymmetrical bilaterally with history of prolonged rupture of membrane,
suggesting congenital pneumonia. In developing countries, pneumonias
account for more than 50% cases of respiratory distress in newborn.
In congenital pneumonia, respiratory distress is noticed soon after
birth or during first 24 hours. Auscultatory signs may be nonspecific.
The newborn may die from pneumonia without manifesting distress.
Neonates may develop pneumonia postnatally as a consequence of
septicemia, aspiration of feeds, and ventilation for respiratory failure.

continued till baby no longer requires oxygen for at least a
minimum period of 24 hours.
Based on severity of respiratory distress, baby would
require oxygen (Downes’ score 1–3), continuous positive
pressure ventilation (Downes’ 4–6), or mechanical ventilation
(Downes’ score >6). Oxygen can be provided with oxygen hood

Fig. 4: Patchy opacities with intermittent hyperlucent areas suggestive
of air entrapment are seen in MAS. Babies born through meconium
stained liquor could have meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) and
aspiration may occur in utero, during delivery or immediately after
birth. Thick meconium could block air passages and cause atelectasis
and air leak syndromes.

or nasal cannula for achieving appropriate oxygen saturation
(88–92% in preterm and 90–93% in term). Oxygen when given
therapeutically should always be warmed and humidified.
When oxygen hood is used for administering oxygen, oxygen
flow rate should be 5–6 L/min. Flow rate less than 3 L/min is not
appropriate as may lead to carbon dioxide rebreathing. If an
oxygen hood is used with all side ports closed and flow rate of 5
L/min, the baby would receive around 80% oxygen, if one side
port is kept open with same flow rate, baby would receive 60%
oxygen while baby would receive 40% oxygen if both side ports
are kept open. The percentage of oxygen needed by baby can
be determined by oxygen saturation reading shown in pulse
oximeter. The aim should be to maintain oxygen saturation
in the range of 90–94%. Another useful method of providing
oxygen is nasal prongs. Appropriate sized prongs which fit into
neonate’s nostrils should be used. If baby’s oxygen saturation is
acceptable, we can slowly wean off oxygen.

Clinical Pearl
• During oxygen therapy, percentage of oxygen needed should
be determined in a neonate by oxygen saturation reading in
a pulse oximeter. Oxygen is a drug and overdose should be
avoided. Target SpO2 should be 90–94% in neonates.

The body temperature of the neonate should be maintained
in normal range (36.5–37.5°C). Fluid and electrolyte balance
should be maintained. If baby is having moderate-to-severe
respiratory distress, baby can be maintained on intravenous
fluid. If mild respiratory distress is there, as assessed by Downes’
score, baby can be fed expressed breast milk by tube feeding.
Blood sugar should be monitored and kept in normal range
(40–125 mg/dL). If baby has apnea, baby should be stimulated

pneumothorax because quick recognition and prompt treatment could be life-saving. The distress is usually sudden in onset and heart sounds
become less distinct. Immediate management in hemodynamically unstable neonate is by a needle aspiration and later chest tube drainage.

by providing tactile stimulation or positive pressure ventilation
by bag and mask. Repeated episodes might indicate need for
CPAP or mechanical ventilation, if severe. Such babies would
need transfer to centers with facility for CPAP or mechanical
ventilation if these are not available locally.
All babies with respiratory distress do not need antibiotics.
Babies with TTNB do not need antibiotics. However, if

ch-03.indd 11

respiratory distress is persistent or risk factors for sepsis are
present, antibiotics should be started after taking cultures. If
cultures come negative and clinically baby does not seem to
have infection, antibiotics can be stopped.
Continuous positive airway pressure is indicated for
neonates with respiratory distress if Downes’ score is 4–6.
Experience is required for the successful application of CPAP,

11

Section 1: Neonatology
especially with short binasal prongs. Single prong method may
be beneficial for nurseries who have less experience with short
binasal prongs or when application of short binasal prongs
is problematic. While commencing CPAP, it can be given at a
pressure of 6–8 cm of water with sufficient oxygen to maintain
target saturation. An orogastric tube needs to be passed to
decompress the stomach. While baby is on CPAP, continuous
monitoring of saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate is
indicated. Blood gases are indicated when pressures or oxygen
percentage are changed or patient’s condition shows some
change. The circuit integrity should be checked periodically.

Clinical Pearl
• Downes’ score of 4–6 is an indication for continuous positive
airway pressure. A score of greater than 6 is an indication for
mechanical ventilation.

Baby’s improvement would be indicated by reduction
in respiratory rate, stabilization or reduction of oxygen
requirement to maintain saturation of 92–95%, reduction in
sternal and intercostal retraction, reduction in grunt, and
improved ABG reports. The need for CPAP for acute lung
conditions usually lasts for 1–3 days.
Weaning is commenced when saturation is more than 96%,
retraction, grunt disappears, and respiratory rate stabilizes
with normal blood gas reports. While weaning, initially FiO2
is brought down and then pressure is reduced by 1–2 cm/h
until a pressure of 5 cm is reached. When neonate is stabilized
in 21% oxygen and 5 cm H2O, ceasing CPAP is considered.
However, recommencing CPAP may be needed at times if work
of breathing is increased or oxygen requirement increases.
Complications of CPAP, like pneumothorax, must be excluded
in such babies.
Continuous positive airway pressure is said to be failed if
there is rapid rise for oxygen requirement, respiratory acidosis
or partial pressure of carbon dioxide greater than 60 mmHg,
recurrent apnea and increased work of breathing indicated by
excessive retraction grunt and retraction, or if agitation is not
relieved.
There can be at times complications of CPAP like pneumo­
thorax, nasal trauma or CPAP belly, i.e., distension of abdomen.

If CPAP fails or Downes’ score is more than 6, there is need
for mechanical ventilation.

Specific Management
In case of pneumonia, antibiotic is indicated. Antibiotic
of choice should be based on local antibiotic sensitivity
pattern. In case of hyaline membrane disease, surfactant
replacement therapy is indicated. If pneumothorax occurs,
needle decompression or chest tube drainage may be
required. Small pneumothoraces can be treated in term
infants without invasive management through nitrogen
washout. Administration of 100% oxygen can accelerate the
resolution of the pneumothorax as readily absorbed oxygen
replaces nitrogen in the extrapulmonary space. Neonates
with respiratory distress due to surgical conditions, like
tracheoesophageal fistula, diaphragmatic hernia, etc., would
need surgical intervention. Respiratory distress due to cardiac
failure would need management of cardiac failure.

COMMON CLINICAL
INDICATIONS FOR RESPIRATORY
SUPPORT IN Neonatal Intensive Care Unit

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory disorders are one of the commonest reasons
for admission to the neonatal unit. Innovations in neonatal
respiratory care over the past few decades resulting in the
availability of a number of noninvasive and invasive modalities
of therapy have revolutionized the management of babies
with respiratory disorders, especially the very low birth weight
(VLBW) group.
The aims of respiratory support are to maintain adequate
oxygenation and ventilation, to reduce respiratory work and to
prevent lung injury.
The modalities of respiratory support commonly available
in our neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) include:

Section 1: Neonatology

OXYGEN THERAPY

•

Indications
Oxygen therapy is indicated for hypoxemia resulting from
reduced alveolar oxygen content, low ventilation-perfusion
ratio, reduced diffusion capacity, or extrapulmonary right-toleft shunts. The aim of therapy is to achieve adequate tissue
oxygenation without creating oxygen toxicity and oxidative
stress. Strategies to “normalize” oxygenation with use of high
FiO2 result in high rates of retinopathy of prematurity, chronic
lung disease, brain, and other organ injury, especially in the
premature infant.

Clinical Pearl
• Oxygen therapy should be used judiciously and blended airoxygen mixture using a blender preferably with an oxygen
analyzer should be used at all times to target oxygen saturation
between 90 and 95%.

Oxygen is usually administered:
• By means of a head box, mask, nasal cannula. Here, an
external air-oxygen blender should be used to titrate
the fraction of oxygen delivered. It is used for mild-tomoderately severe respiratory disorders in term babies
without evidence of respiratory failure
It is important to note that in preterm with RDS, there is
little role for standalone oxygen therapy as the priority is
to recruit adequate lung volume by early use of continuous
distending airway pressure
• As part of assisted therapy: CPAP or mechanical ventilation
wherein supplemental oxygen is administered by the
mixture of air and oxygen in the ventilator or CPAP device.

Clinical Pearl
• Gas warming and humidification is essential to avoid drying
of the airways and secretions as well as to avoid convective
heat losses when using head box, nasal cannulas, or assisted
ventilation.

NONINVASIVE RESPIRATORY SUPPORT
Noninvasive respiratory support has become the mainstay
of respiratory therapy in the NICU so as to reduce complications
of invasive mechanical ventilation like ventilator associated
pneumonias and chronic lung disease.

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure

14

ch-04.indd 14

Mechanism of Action

Continuous positive airway pressure is the application of
continuous distending pressure to the airways of spontaneously
breathing baby. Current evidence strongly supports the role of
early use of CPAP to reduce the need for intubation, invasive
ventilation, and surfactant therapy for extremely low birth
weight (ELBW) babies by 50%.

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Alveolar stabilization and maintenance of functional
residual capacity (FRC)
Facilitates gas exchange by preventing collapse of the
alveoli at end expiration
Decreases the work of breathing as the pressure required
to overcome the collapsing forces generated by surface
tension is reduced when the alveolus is partially inflated.
Conserves surfactant
Decreased ventilation-perfusion mismatch
Helps maintain upper airway stability by stenting the
airway and decreasing obstruction
Lowers airway resistance to gas flow in patients with
obstructive lung disease and apnea
Augments stretch receptors and decreases diaphragmatic
fatigue
Reduces intracardiac left-to-right shunt.

Indications
•
•
•
•
•
•

Any respiratory distress with or without low FRC and not
because of listed contraindication
Postextubation
Meconium aspiration syndrome
Tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia with terminal airway
collapse
Some congenital heart defect with increased pulmonary
blood flow
Partial paralysis of diaphragm.

Contraindications
•
•
•
•
•
•

Pneumothorax
Choanal atresia
Cleft lip or palate
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia
Tracheoesophageal fistula
Cardiac failure or hemodynamic instability.

Types of Continuous Positive
Airway Pressure Delivery Systems
•

•
•

Continuous flow CPAP system: continuous flow CPAP
consists of gas flow generated at a source and directed
against the resistance of the expiratory limb of the circuit.
Ventilator derived CPAP and bubble or underwater CPAP
are examples of continuous flow devices
Ventilator based CPAP: ease of use, pressure stability, and
an effective alarm system. Ventilator CPAP is typically used
for infant extubated from mechanical ventilator
Bubble CPAP: In this system of delivery, short binasal
prongs are attached to a circuit with a gas source providing
blended, warm, humidified gas at flow rate of 5–8 L/min;
the expiratory limb is partly submerged under water. The
height of the submerged water column in centimeters
represents CPAP pressure in centimeters. The benefits of
bubble CPAP are ease of setup and low cost. However, as
there is no audible pressure disconnect alarm, no warning
occurs even when there are leaks in the system. Visual
alarm of “no bubbling” and clinical observations of the
patient are essential to maintaining patient safety

11/24/2016 12:15:57 PM

Chapter 4: Respiratory Support in Newborns
•

Variable flow CPAP: variable flow CPAP represents a
sophisticated technology of CPAP delivery with visual and
audible alarms. The major benefit is a decrease in the work
of breathing due to the variable flow. However, it requires
specific equipment such as flow drivers, generators, and
circuits that are expensive. Although data suggests that
some of these systems are superior to others, in clinical
practice, the stability of the nasal interface is probably the
most important factor determining the success or failure of
this form of respiratory support.

Clinical Pearl
• Endotracheal continuous positive airway pressure should
never be used as it significantly increases the work of breathing.
It is like breathing through a straw.

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Failure
•
•
•
•

Oxygen requirement greater than 60% to maintain
saturation 91–95% and CPAP greater than 8 cm H2O
A respiratory acidosis, pH less than 7.20 with partial
pressure of carbon dioxide greater than 60 mmHg
Recurrent apneic episodes
Increased work of breathing (sternal and intercostal
recession/grunt/tachypnea).

Clinical Pearl
• Before using alternative mode of ventilation for continuous
positive airway pressure failure, quickly go through check
list to ensure adequate flow delivery, adequate pressure, and
position of interface.

Complications
Interface Used for Delivery of
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
Short binasal prongs are most effective due to reduced airway
resistance. Nasal masks are also finding favor as a CPAP
interface.

Initiating Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

Continuous positive airway pressure should be initiated
soon after birth in infants who have sufficient respiratory
drive and evidence of respiratory distress, especially in
ELBW babies. More than 50% of ELBW infants who are not
depressed at birth can be managed successfully with nasal
continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), avoiding the
use of invasive ventilation. For any preterm with RDS, CPAP
should be promptly instituted if the Silverman Anderson
score is greater than or equal to 3 or the FiO2 requirement
is greater than or equal to 30%
Place the baby supine with a slight head extension
Choose the appropriate sized short binasal prongs size 0 or
1. Avoid pressure of the prongs against the nasal septum
Start with a CPAP of 5–6 cm H2O, flow of 5–7 L/min of
blended, warm, humidified gas
Use appropriate FiO2 to maintain SaO2 between 90 and 95%
Titrate CPAP pressure till the grunting and retractions are
relieved or till a maximum of 8 cm H2O
If FiO2 requirement is greater than or equal to 0.4,
administer surfactant as early rescue therapy by intubationsurfactant-extubation (INSURE) technique.

Clinical Pearls
• Any kind of noninvasive support demands same vigilance as
invasive support
• Adequacy of flow is decided by bubbling at expiratory
limb; adequacy of oxygenation is decided by SpO2 on pulse
oximeter; and adequacy of pressure is decided by chest
retractions.

ch-04.indd 15

Pneumothorax: incidence varies between 0.5 and 2% though
the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or Intubation at Birth
(COIN) study showed a higher incidence of 9%. In this trial,
CPAP pressure of 8 cm H2O was used compared to conventional
5–6 cm of NCPAP.
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure belly: benign gaseous
abdominal distention that can be minimized by evacuating the
gas in the stomach routinely every 3 hours and by maintaining
an open-to-air orogastric tube while on CPAP
Nasal septum damage: this occurs due to care-related problems
and is preventable with proper prong size and position,
minimizing tubing torque, gentle intermittent cleansing, and
proper heating and humidification.

Clinical Pearl
• Advantage of noninvasive respiratory support outweighs
complications related to it.

Heated Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula
The heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) is a simple, noninvasive method of oxygen delivery
that can produce positive pressure in the airways. The system
consists of delivery of heated and humidified, blended airoxygen gas delivered to the baby by nasal cannula with short
binasal prongs. Blended gas administered at flow rates of
more than 1 L/min produces distending airway pressure. The
distending pressure generated depends on the size of the nasal
cannula, and the flow rate. Generally, flow rates of 3–6 L/min
are used. Care should be taken to ensure that the nasal prongs
do not fit the nares tightly as very high distending pressure can
be generated.
The benefits of HH-HFNC are the simplicity of use, less
risk of damage to the nares and nasal septum, and comfort for
more mature babies with RDS. The risk of using HH-HFNC lies
in the inability to effectively measure distending pressure.

Section 1: Neonatology

Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation
This is a method of assisted ventilation without an endotracheal
(ET) tube in the trachea, and using either nasal prongs or nasal
mask as the interface. The ventilator delivers peak inspiratory
pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at the
set inspiratory time, rate, and FiO2.
The common methods of delivery used are:
• Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation
• Synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure venti­
lation (SNIPPV).

Mechanism of Action
Like CPAP, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation
expands the lung, increases FRC, prevents alveolar collapse,
and improves ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
Synchronized NIPPV results in a higher tidal volume
compared to NCPAP breaths and nonsynchronized NIPPV.
Whether synchronized or not, NIPPV improves thoraco­
abdominal asynchrony and chest wall stabilization, resulting
in a decreased work of breathing.

Indications for Use
•

•
•

Postextubation support: several randomized controlled
trials have demonstrated a reduction in extubation failure
using synchronized nasal ventilation compared to CPAP
but not when nonsynchronized NIPPV was used
Apnea of prematurity: NIPPV has been found to be more
effective than NCPAP
Respiratory distress syndrome as primary support: few
small studies have reported improved carbon dioxide
removal, reduced apnea, and shorter duration of
ventilation in the NIPPV group. A significant reduction
in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has been
reported when NIPPV is used as respiratory support after
extubation or as a primary mode for RDS. It appears that
nonsynchronized early NIPPV seems to be beneficial for
slightly mature and heavier infants when compared with
NCPAP. However, SNIPPV presents potential advantages
over NCPAP and NIPPV, but more studies are needed for
generalization
Potential drawbacks include the likelihood of gastro­
intestinal complications due to the additional pressure, risk
for air leaks, and nasal damage as seen for CPAP therapy.

Clinical Pearl
• So far, evidences that favor noninvasive ventilation are mainly
related to its use in postextubation neonates.

•
•

Clinical Pearl
• Decision to provide ventilatory support should not be
exclusively based on blood gas.

Modes of Ventilation
Conventional ventilation is time-cycled pressure-limited.
Currently, patient triggered modes of ventilation like
synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)
and assist control are preferred. Pressure support ventilation
(PSV) is a mode of ventilation in which patient’s spontaneous
breaths are augmented by supplemental inspiratory pressure.
This may be used along with SIMV or CPAP. It is particularly
useful in weaning off ventilation.
Flow cycling is increasingly being used wherein the breath
is terminated not at a set inspiratory time but when inspiratory
flow is reduced to 30% of the peak flow.
Flow cycling gives inspiratory as well as expiratory
synchrony.

Controls in Ventilation
Although pressure controlled ventilation has been used
traditionally, volume targeting to reduce volutrauma, the
major factor implicated in BPD is increasingly being preferred.
This can be delivered by using volume controlled ventilation
or in the pressure limited mode with volume guarantee,
volume limit, or hybrid modes like pressure regulated volume
control. The tidal volume is set, and once reached, the breath
is terminated. Set tidal volume 4–6 mL/kg for preterm and
6–8 mL/kg for term infants.

Ventilation Strategies
Ventilator-associated lung injury has been traditionally
thought to result from high pressures and barotruma.
However, studies have shown that it is the high volumes
and volutrauma responsible for major lung damage. Lung
injury is also caused by repeated collapse and reopening
of the alveoli which occurs with very low end-expiratory
pressures.

Respiratory distress syndrome
•
•

Provide adequate PEEP to avoid atelectasis 5–6 cm
Provide PIP enough to achieve adequate oxygenation and
ventilation.

Conventional Ventilation

Meconium aspiration syndrome

Indications

Due to the risk of hyperinflation, low PEEP 4–5 cm, moderate
pressure, and rapid rates are often needed. Analgesia and
sedation may also be required.

•

Apnea

11/24/2016 12:15:57 PM

Chapter 4: Respiratory Support in Newborns
•

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
Moderate pressure required, may require longer inspiratory
time of 0.4–0.5 seconds.

Management after Initiating Ventilation
•

Check adequacy of mechanical breaths: good air entry
heard over both sides of the chest, chest rise, and synchro­
nization. Chest wall expansion must be just adequate and
not excessive
Maintain saturation between 91 and 95%; reduce FiO2
clinically on the pulse oximeter
If retractions persist after breaths are synchronized: PEEP/
PIP need to be adjusted
Monitor pulses, noninvasive blood pressure, capillary refill
time
After stabilizing the baby, check an arterial blood gas (ABG)
Do a chest X-ray: look for position of the ET tube.

•
•
•
•
•

•

Pneumothorax may be diagnosed by auscultation, trans­
illumination, or chest X-ray. An emergency thoracentesis
may be required
Reset ventilator by settings used during hand ventilation.

Weaning
•

•
•
•

Once the patient is clinically stable, blood gases have
normalized, and X-ray shows improvement, the ventilator
settings are gradually decreased keeping in mind the
progress of disease process
Improvement of lung compliance on the pressure volume
loops and tidal volume scalers is a good indicator for
considering weaning
Diuresis in preterm is also a good indicator of improving
lung function. Decrease the most damaging parameters,
i.e., FiO2 and PIP first
Changes are accomplished in small decrements (PIP 2 cm
H2O, FiO2 5%, rate 5 beats per min).

Ventilator Adjustments
•

To improve oxygenation: increase FiO2, mean airway
pressure (MAP), inspiratory time, respiratory rate
To improve ventilation and decrease PaCO2: increase MAP
or respiratory rate.

•

Algorithm 1
Algorithm for management of respiratory distress syndrome

Sudden Deterioration
•

Look for inadvertent extubation, malposition of ET tube
(right mainstem) or ET tube occlusion
Suction the ET to remove secretions
Auscultate for air entry. Remove from ventilator and
stabilize by bag and tube ventilation
Rule out ventilator malfunction
Do an ABG and chest X-ray. Emergency reintubation may
be needed

Air leak syndromes [pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial
emphysema (PIE)]
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: certain centers use

Failure of conventional ventilation in the preterm infant
(severe RDS, PIE, pulmonary hypoplasia) or to reduce
barotrauma when conventional ventilator settings are high.

Initial Settings on High
Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation
On an HFOV ventilator, the oxygenation is controlled by
changing the MAP also called Paw or by the FiO2.
Ventilation is controlled by the amplitude (δP) and the
frequency.
In contrast to conventional ventilation, decreasing the
frequency increases the tidal volume delivered, thereby
increasing the carbon dioxide washout.
Initial settings: aim is to maximize recruitment of alveoli:
• Set MAP 2–3 cm H2O above the MAP on conventional
ventilation
• Set frequency to 8–10 Hz for term babies and 10–12 Hz for
preterms
• Generally, the frequency is set at 10 Hz, inspiratory time at
33%, and rarely require change throughout the course of
ventilation
• Set amplitude to get good vibrations (wobble) of chest,
abdomen, and upper thighs.

12–14 cm H2O (larger babies may be extubated with PIP 14)
Respiratory rate of 20–25 beats per minute
FiO2 requirement less than 40%
Extubation to nasal CPAP/NIPPV is especially useful in
VLBW babies
Postextubation, periodic suctioning as needed, gentle
chest physiotherapy, and nebulization with ipratropium
help stabilization.

High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation
High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is a type
of mechanical ventilation that uses a constant distending
pressure (MAP) with pressure variations (δP) oscillating
around the MAP at very high rates (up to 900 cycles per min).
This creates small tidal volume, often less than the dead space.

Suctioning
•

•
•

Suction is indicated for diminished chest wall movement
(chest wobble), elevated carbon dioxide, and/or
worsening oxygenation suggesting airway or ET tube
obstruction, or if there are visible/audible secretions in
the airway
Avoid in the first 24 hours of HFOV unless clinically
indicated
Press the “stop” button briefly while quickly inserting and
withdrawing suction catheter (PEEP is maintained).

Weaning
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Reduce FiO2 to less than 40% gradually
Reduce MAP when chest radiograph shows evidence of
overinflation (>9 ribs) or hyperoxemia on ABG
Reduce MAP by 1–2 cm H2O to 8–10 cm H2O
In air leak syndromes, reducing MAP takes priority over
weaning the FiO2
Wean the amplitude in 2–4 cm H2O decrements based
on PaCO2
Discontinue HFOV when MAP 8–10 cm H2O and amplitude
20–25
If infant is stable, oxygenating well and blood gases are
satisfactory, then infant could be extubated to CPAP or
switched to conventional ventilation.

Persistent Pulmonary
Hypertension of the Newborn
Ram G Holla, Ira J Holla

INTRODUCTION
The fetal circulation is characterized by two parallel circu­
lations, with a high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and
right-to-left shunting at the levels of the ductus arteriosus
and foramen ovale. At birth, there is a fall in the PVR due to
lung expansion and a simultaneous rise in systemic vascular
resistance (SVR). Humoral mediators released in response to
elevated arterial oxygen content and pH further constrict the
ductus. This transforms the fetal circulation, characterized
by pulmonary and systemic circuits in series to the adult
circulation, in which the two circuits function in parallel.
Failure to achieve or sustain the normal decrease in PVR
at birth, results in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the
newborn (PPHN).
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn is
a clinical syndrome characterized by sustained elevation
in PVR at birth, with resulting shunting from right to left
through persistent fetal channels.

MECHANISMS LEADING
TO PERSISTENT PULMONARY
HYPERTENSION OF THE NEWBORN (TABLE 1)
Normal pulmonary vascular development in infancy requires
maintenance of low PVR after birth and is necessary for normal

lung function and growth. The developing lung is subject
to multiple genetic, pathological, and/or environmental
influences that can adversely affect lung adaptation,
development, and growth, leading to pulmonary hypertension.

Clinical Pearl
• Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn is caused
by failure of pulmonary pressures to fall after birth leading to
right-to-left shunting, hypoxemia, acidosis, and shock.

hours

blood gas may show similar findings (PaO2 >20 mm, higher
in the preductal sample). A subset of infants may have rightto-left shunting only at the level of the foramen ovale and not
at the ductus, and may fail to show differential cyanosis.
Respiratory symptoms are related to the underlying
disease, distress being the most severe in meconium aspiration
syndrome, diaphragmatic hernia, respiratory distress syndrome,
pneumonia, etc.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Primary pulmonary disease without elevated PVR and
structural heart disease associated with right-to-left shunting
should be excluded before a diagnosis of PPHN can be made.

Clinical Pearl
• Differential oxygenation: SpO2 10% higher, PaO2 20 mmHg
higher in preductal than postductal samples.

Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn

Investigations and Diagnosis
•
•
•

Chest X-ray usually shows the underlying pulmonary
disease or may be normal. The cardiac silhouette is usually
normal. Pulmonary blood flow may be diminished
The electrocardiogram is usually normal for age
An echocardiography must be performed in every baby with
PPHN for diagnosis and exclusion of cardiac disease. The
size, direction, and location of shunt should be assessed.

•

In all cases, response to treatment, particularly changes in
cardiac output and direction of ductal shunting, should be
assessed by repeated echocardiographic assessments
Hyperoxia test: hyperoxia with or without hyper­ventilation
can help to predict the presence and reversibility of
pulmonary hypertension. Details are given in algorithm 1.

MANAGEMENT
Management of a neonate with PPHN (Algorithm 2) constitutes
a medical emergency in which correction of hypoxia is
important for reversal of pulmonary hypertension, limitation of
shunting, establishment of systemic perfusion, and prevention
of end-organ damage.
• General measures:
{{ Correct underlying metabolic/hematological derange­
ments:
–– Correct acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia,
polycythemia, hypothermia
–– Treatment directed at the specific disorder causing
PPHN, e.g., congenital diaphragmatic hernia
{{ Monitoring:
–– Blood pressure—preferably intra-arterial
–– Pulse oximetry (both pre- and postductal)
–– Transcutaneous oxygen/carbon dioxide
–– End-tidal CO2
–– Frequent postductal blood gas assessments
–– Monitoring of blood gas should be accompanied by
charting of trends in PaO2, PaCO2, alveolar-arterial
oxygen gradient (AaDO2), and oxygenation index
(see appendix ‘A’)
{{ Sedation/paralysis: the hyper-reactive pulmonary circu­
lation is highly sensitive to catecholamines leading to
increased PVR. Stress should be blocked by silence,
avoidance of disturbance, gentle handling, and sedation
–– Fentanyl (2–5 µg/kg/h)
–– Morphine (5–10 µg/kg/h) infused continuously
–– Very agitated or unstable neonates, particularly
if breathing out of phase, may be paralyzed with
pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg/dose; every 1–4 h PRN)
or vecuronium
{{ Maintain hematocrit above 45%

Ventilation: optimize lung recruitment and reduce
ventilation-perfusion mismatch: specific approaches to
respiratory support and mechanical ventilation vary. A
gentle approach that maintains adequate oxygenation
and mild hyperventilation (PaCO2 35–45 mmHg, and pH
at 7.35–7.45), generally lowers the PVR to the extent of
abolishing right-to-left shunting. The state of the underlying
lung should dictate the specific respiratory management
strategy, keeping always in mind that high intrathoracic
pressure may worsen the situation by impeding cardiac
output and elevating PVR. High frequency oscillatory
ventilation (HFOV) is often useful in treating infants whose
PPHN is associated with severe pulmonary parenchymal
disease. Neonates with PPHN are unstable in their
cardiopulmonary status and weaning from ventilation
should be done very gradually to prevent reversal.
Surfactant therapy should be used where applicable
Optimize cardiac output and left ventricular function,
maintenance of systemic blood pressure: the aim of
cardiovascular management is to optimize systemic
blood pressure to levels above the pulmonary pressure in
order to minimize or eliminate right-to-left shunt. Target
mean blood pressure levels would be 45–55 mmHg. Low
blood pressure may be normalized by the use of:
{{ Volume expansion: especially in hypovolemic conditions
(e.g., hemorrhage, hydrops, capillary leak) or decreased
SVR (e.g., septic shock) or systemic hypotension
{{ Vasopressors: dopamine, dobutamine, and/or adrenaline
often are necessary to achieve adequate cardiac
output. Dopamine in doses more than 10 µg/kg/min
and adrenaline increase SVR through stimulation of
α- and β-receptors. High doses of both may stimulate
pulmonary α-receptors, leading to increased PVR. When
cardiac function is poor, cardiotonic medications, such
as milrinone that both enhance cardiac output and lower
PVR, might be useful
Decrease PVR:
{{ Alkalinization:
alkalosis reduces PVR. Alkalosis
can be achieved by gentle hyperventilation and/or
conservative use of metabolic therapy with sodium
bicarbonate, aiming for a pH of 7.35–7.45

Nitric oxide: nitric oxide relaxes the vascular smooth
muscle and causes pulmonary vasodilation. Inhaled
nitric oxide (iNO) is administered by conventional
or high frequency ventilation in doses of 5–20 ppm,
diffuses into ventilated alveoli, causes localized
vasodilatation and improves oxygenation, in addition
to decreasing PVR
• Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): ECMO
often is lifesaving therapy for infants with PPHN who fail
conventional management and/or iNO treatment.
Ligation or pharmacological closure of the duct is not useful
and may be detrimental. There is insufficient data to justify the
use of other proposed medical therapies including sildenafil,
magnesium sulfate, calcium channel blockers, adenosine,
inhaled prostacyclin, ethyl nitrite, bosentan (endothelin
receptor antagonist), and inhaled or intravenous tolazoline.

Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
Naveen Bajaj, Ruchi Nanawati

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD) is a clinical syndrome following very preterm delivery
that results in decreased oxygenation, an increased work of
breathing, and lung abnormalities that persist into childhood.
In very low birth weight (VLBW) babies, overall incidence is
22% and is inversely related to gestational age and birth weight.
Although it can occur in full term infants, it is uncommon in
infants born after 32 weeks.

Clinical Pearl
• Bronchopulmonary dysplasia mainly occurs in very low birth
weight babies.

DEFINITION
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia has been defined by different
authors as the need of supplemental oxygen either at 28 days
of life or at 36 weeks of postconceptional age. The most recent
National Institute of Health (NIH) consensus definition is
described in table 1.
The more specific old term BPD instead of more recent
term CLD is preferred, because this disease is clearly distinct
from the multiple CLDs of later life.

BPD, bronchopulmonary dysplasia; PMA, postmenstrual age; NCPAP, nasal
continuous positive airway pressure; PPV, positive pressure ventilation.

Old and New Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
In recent years, with improved survival of extreme premature
infants, the clinical and X-ray findings that define BPD has
changed and a milder clinical disease called “new BPD” has
emerged (Table 2).

Clinical Pearl
• New bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a milder form of
disease is more common than old BPD nowadays.

ch-06.indd 23

PATHOGENESIS
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is caused by multiple adverse
events during pre- and postnatal period (Algorithm 1).

Predisposing Factors

•
•

High intermittent positive pressure ventilation/oxygen
requirement

Genetic predisposition.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia usually develops in premature
neonates being treated with oxygen and positive pressure
ventilation for respiratory failure, most commonly due to RDS.
It is often anticipated when mechanical ventilation or oxygen
dependence extend beyond 10–14 days. Common clinical
pointers are:
• Preterm on ventilator, failure to wean, extubation failures
• Persistent or increased oxygen requirement
• Signs of respiratory distress
• Barrel shaped chest
• Severe bronchospasm
• Cardiomegaly, hypertension, and cor pulmonale
• Copious secretions, tracheo- and bronchomalacia
• Feed intolerance, failure to thrive.

Clinical Pearl
• Ventilatory or oxygen dependency beyond 2 weeks of life is an
early suspicious sign of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Chest X-ray

Clinical Pearl
• Prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, ventilation, and
infections are common predisposing factors.

Northway originally described the four stages of radiographic
appearances in BPD (Table 3). The new BPD on X-ray only
shows diffuse haziness, occasionally, infiltrates or segmental
atelectasis.

TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR SUSPECTED
BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA
Though there is no single magical therapy for BPD, but multiple
“best practices” result in better outcome of these infants. These
include multidisciplinary preventive and treatment strategies.
Algorithm 2 depicts the timeline and management strategies
of BPD.
Respiratory support: gentle ventilation to maintain adequate
gas exchange while minimizing ventilator induced lung
injury. The aim is to ventilate for the shortest possible time,
wean gradually, use methylxanthines (caffeine preferred than
aminophylline) for apneas and in periextubation period, and
extubate to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
as early as possible. The ventilator strategy and the targets used
in these cases are summarized in table 4.
Postextubation physiotherapy is helpful in managing
segmental collapse and increased airway secretions.

Clinical Pearl
• Gentle ventilation, early extubation, and use of noninvasive
ventilation are the goals.

Delivery of oxygen: warm humidified oxygen by nasal cannula
or hood to maintain SpO2 between 89 and 94%. Infants with
no other medical problem can be given home oxygen therapy
by nasal cannula from a portable oxygen cylinder/oxygen
concentrator. Monitor oxygen requirement and weight gain.
Desaturation during and after feeding: managed by increasing
the inspired oxygen concentration.

11/18/2016 4:59:23 PM

Section 1: Neonatology
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia spells: BPD spells which are
sudden episodes of cyanosis and desaturation due to expiratory
flow limitation may require sedation and paralysis.
Fluid and nutrition: even though these neonates have an
augmented metabolic demand requiring higher intake of
calories (120–160 kcal/kg/day) to sustain growth, they cannot
tolerate increased fluid volumes. Hence, fluids are restricted
to 120–150 mL/kg/day. Neonates who cannot be fed should
be given parenteral nutrition. Those on oral feeds may be
fed calorie-dense feeds (24–30 kcal/oz) by fortification of
expressed breast milk with human milk fortifier or by using
high calorie formula. Supplementation with medium chain
triglyceride oil is another option. Adequate intake of calcium,
phosphorus, vitamins, and iron should be ensured.
Treatment of infections: bacterial or fungal infections are
frequent in BPD infants and worsen the lung damage and
should be investigated and treated.
Drug treatment (Table 5): before a drug is initiated in a case
of BPD, one should always revisit the decision and seriously
consider if that drug is required.
Follow these principles of a drug therapy:
• All drugs have adverse effects
• Anticipate that a drug may have no therapeutic effect
• If you start a drug, be willing to stop it.

Clinical Pearl
• Avoid using drug, especially steroids. Use steroids only in
ventilator dependent babies who are more than 1 week of life,
in smallest possible dose and for shortest duration.

Preventive Strategies
Avoidance of factors that predispose to lung injury is
cornerstone of management of BPD. Some of the proven
strategies in the management of BPD are as follows:
• Antenatal steroids
• Early surfactant therapy
• Ventilation strategies: aim is to minimize lungs injury by
optimizing the ventilator strategies which includes:
{{ Early institution of CPAP
{{ Use of intubation-surfactant-extubation (INSURE)
tech­nique followed by CPAP
{{ Use of patient triggered ventilation: more physiological
{{ Permissive hypercapnia: accepting PCO levels as high
2
as 55 mmHg with pH greater than or equal to 7.25
{{ Avoidance of hyperoxia: target SpO : 85–92% in acute
2
phase of ventilation
{{ High frequency oscillation: less injurious to lungs, but
no evidence for its benefits in routine use.
• Early use of caffeine therapy: within first 72 hours,
preferably as early as feasible
• Low fluid intake
• Aggressive nutrition strategies
• Prevention of nosocomial infections
• Aggressive treatment of PDA
• Vitamin A: essential for lung development and differen­
tiation. Its use in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) babies
as 5,000 IU IM three times/week for 4 weeks reduces risk
of BPD
• Inhaled nitric oxide: proven role yet to be established
• Corticosteroids: not recommended.

Chapter 6: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia

Clinical Pearl
• Respiratory strategies aim to minimize lung injury and
early use of caffeine reduces the chances of developing
bronchopulmonary dysplasia..

INFANT STIMULATION
AND PARENTAL SUPPORT
Infants with severe BPD may be ventilator dependent
for many weeks or months and thus, deprived of normal
parental stimulation. A well-organized stimulation program
and parental participation helps in reducing infant’s neuro­
developmental delays and allaying parental anxiety.

DISCHARGE PLANNING
Usually, oxygen can be discontinued in before discharge.
However, home oxygen therapy is a safe alternative to longterm hospitalization in selected cases:
• Stable babies with no other medical illness
• Stable oxygen requirement
• Parents prepared and trained
• Follow-up is ensured.

OUTCOME
The outcome has improved because of better management and
milder form of the disease.
Mortality is low; however, when it occurs is usually because
of respiratory failure, infections, pulmonary hypertension, and
cor pulmonale. Infants with severe BPD are at higher risk of:
• Growth failure
• Feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux
• Recurrent chest infections
• Hyper-reactive airway disease

•
•

Long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae
Recurrent hospitalization.

Patent Ductus Arteriosus
Kiran P Sathe, Anjali Kulkarni

INTRODUCTION
It is the abnormal persistence of the normal fetal vessel
joining the pulmonary trunk to the descending aorta. It is one
of the commonest congenital cardiac anomaly in neonatal
period especially in the preterm neonates. It may result in
altered hemodynamics and can complicate the clinical course
in the inital days of life in sick neonates.

INCIDENCE
Vermont Oxford Network (2006) of nearly 40,000 preterm
infants with a birthweight 501–1,500 g showed the overall
incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to be 37.2%. The
incidence of PDA in infants with gestational ages of 24, 25,
and 26 weeks was 76.9, 69.5, and 61.5%, respectively. Although
spontaneous permanent ductus arteriosus closure occurs
in nearly 34% of extremely low birth weight neonates 2–6
days postnatally and in the majority of very low birth weight
neonates within the first year of life, 60–70% of preterm infants
of less than 28 weeks’ gestation receive medical or surgical
therapy for a PDA.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
During fetal life, ductus arteriosus helps to shunt blood away
from the high resistance pulmonary circulation (Fig. 1).
Postdelivery, the pulmonary vascular resistance falls with
increase in the oxygen tension. This coupled with increase in
systemic vascular resistance following clamping of the cord,
results in reversal of the ductal shunt, eventually resulting in
closure of the ductus. While functional closure occurs within
first 4 days of life, anatomical closure occurs by second week of
life. Failure of the ductal closure results in PDA.

Predisposing Factors

Clinical Pearl
• Patency or closure of ductus depends on the balance between
vasodilator and vasoconstrictive factors. Oxygen therapy
in preterm neonates has a vasoconstricting effect while
prostaglandins (PGE2) have vasodilator effect.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Clinical presentation of PDA has been discussed in detail in
algorithm 1.
In one study, pulse quality (43%) and murmur (42%) had
the highest mean sensitivities. Corresponding specificities
were 74% for pulse volume and 87% for murmur. The
combination of a cardiac murmur with an abnormal pulse
volume had the highest positive predictive value (77%). The
radiological examination did not improve the observers’ ability
to distinguish between patients with and without PDA.

Clinical Pearls

Management of patent ductus arteriosus

• Increase in the pulmonary fluid in an infant with previously
improving or stable respiratory status should raise a suspicion
of underlying patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
• Similar findings can occur with other cardiac lesions, such as
aortic-pulmonary window or an arteriovenous fistula
• Clinical signs are very unreliable for diagnosis of PDA in preterm
infants. Echocardiography should always be used for diagnosis.

INVESTIGATIONS
Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler ultra­
sound: identifies of PDA, associated cardiac defects and
direction of flow with cardiac contractility. Signs of hemo­
dynamically significant duct on echocardiography are:
• Left atrium-to-aortic root diameter ratio of greater than or
equal to 1.4 in the parasternal long axis view
• Ductus arteriosus diameter of greater than or equal to
1.4 mm/kg body weight
• Holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta
• Pulse wave Doppler main pulmonary artery demonstrates
turbulent systolic and diastolic flow and abnormally high
antegrade diastolic flow (≥0.5 m/s).

Clinical Pearls
• Always rule out a duct dependent lesion on echocardiogram
in case the facility is available before starting pharmacotherapy
• Duct dependent pulmonary or systemic blood flow should be
identified on echocardiography, as patent ductus arteriosus
closure is contraindicated in such patients.

•

Conservative Treatment
Managing PDAs with supportive therapies as discussed in
the chapter and waiting for a spontaneous closure as can
happen in approximately 30% cases in first week and many can
close spontaneously in the first year.

Symptomatic Treatment

Clinical Pearl
• Not all patent ductus arteriosus require closure. The optimal
current management approach is not known as there is
paucity of large randomized controlled trials comparing the
three approaches in the current era of neonatal practice.

Supportive Treatment
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Thermoneutral environment
Maintenance of hematocrit >35% to increase the pulmonary
vascular resistance
High positive end-expiratory pressure and lower inspiratory
time
No loop diuretics: results in increased ductal patency
because of vasodilatory prostaglandin E2 release and
increased incidence of side effects. If required, use thiazide
diuretics
Moderate fluid restriction: 110–130 mL/kg/day
Monitoring of weight at least twice daily
Serum electrolytes and renal functions are to be monitored
twice daily
Daily ultrasonography (USG) head.

Dose: 0.2 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for three doses
Targeted treatment: discontinuing treatment when the
sequential echoes show closure even before the full course.
Similar closure rates comparable to full course are there
but a nonstatistical trend toward higher intraventricular
hemorrhage (IVH) in the targeted group does not warrant
using this approach till further trials
Long course: 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/dose once a day for 5 days is
not recommended now as although the closure rates were
similar, the incidence of NEC was increased
Side effects: decreased blood flows to different organs
resulting in cerebral ischemia, renal failure, and NEC.
There is also increased risk of intestinal perforation in
those with concomitant use of hydrocortisone
Contraindications:
{{ Blood urea greater than 60 mg/dL
{{ Serum creatinine greater than 0.8 mg/dL
{{ Urine output less than 1 mL/kg/h
{{ Platelet count less than 50,000/mm3
{{ Necrotizing enterocolitis
{{ Active bleeding
{{ Intraventricular hemorrhage grade III/IV or if prog­
ression of IVH is demonstrated in earlier cranial USG.

Ibuprofen
•

Similar efficacy as compared to indomethacin with lesser
NEC and renal dysfunction. There is, however, few case

Mainly observational data, no randomized controlled trial
available at present
Dose 60 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for 2–5 days
Indications: failure to respond to or contraindication to use
of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors
Safety not established at present
Not currently recommended.

Surgical Ligation

• Feeding during treatment with pharmacotherapy can
continue with enteral trophic feeds preferably human milk.

Agents Used for Pharmacotherapy

reports of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the
newborn with ibuprofen use and nonstatistical increase in
the incidence of chronic lung disease with its use
Dose: 10 mg/kg first dose followed by 5 mg/kg for two more
doses 24 hours apart
Intravenous formulations mostly tried but since this one is
not available in India at present, one should use the oral
form despite the paucity of literature on the same.

Indications: failure of two courses or contraindication for
use of COX inhibitors who have a large PDA and on high
ventilator settings
Increased adverse effects with ligation, hence not preferred
Postoperative: risk of significant brain injury due to intra­
operative compromise or postoperative hemo­
dynamic
instability. Use of functional echocardiography after
surgery should be considered to manage shock.
Coil or device closure for symptomatic PDA with normal
pulmonary artery pressure in children with more than 3 kg.

Key points

))
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the persistence of normal
fetal vessel and usually complicates preterm deliveries

))
Nonspecific clinical presentation mandates echocardiographic
evaluation to conclusively diagnose PDA and assess for any
associated cardiac comorbidities
))
Nonjudicious use of oxygen therapy in preterm babies can be
harmful and can inadvertently lead to ductus closure in cases
with duct dependent lesions
))
Therapeutic closure of ductus is not warranted except in
symptomatic cases

Neonatal Shock
Ranjan K Pejaver, Manisha Halkar

INTRODUCTION

Continued

The term “shock” denotes a complex clinical syndrome
characterized by acute failure of the circulatory system to
maintain adequate tissue and organ perfusion which leads
to inadequate oxygen and nutrient substrate delivery to body
tissues and compromised metabolic waste product removal.

INCIDENCE
Shock is a common morbidity which presents as a neonatal
emergency. As it is a multi factorial disorder the true incidence
is difficult to estimate.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SHOCK
The pathophysiology of shock has been outlined in algorithm 1.

DIAGNOSIS
•
•

•
•
•

Neonates with shock present with diverse signs and
symptoms
In clinical practice, the reference range blood pressure
limits are defined as the gestational and postnatal age
dependent blood pressure values between the 5th (or 10th)
and 95th (or 90th) percentiles
However, by the third day of life, most preterm infants, even
with 24–26 weeks’ gestation, have a mean blood pressure of
30 mmHg or greater (Table 1)
As a rough rule of thumb, the lower limit of normal mean
blood pressure in mmHg on the day of birth is appro­
ximately equal to the gestational age in weeks (Table 2)
Measurement of neonatal blood pressure can be completed
directly through invasive techniques, i.e., direct manometry
using an arterial catheter or use of an in-line pressure

transducer or indirectly through noninvasive techniques
which include manual oscillometric techniques and
automated Doppler techniques.

Clinical Pearl
• Noninvasive methods may overestimate the blood pressure in
hypotensive infants.

INVESTIGATIONS IN NEONATAL SHOCK
Investigations to be done in neonatal shock have been enlisted
in table 3.

• Low blood pressure in a preterm baby may not need to be
treated unless associated with signs of poor perfusion
• Since dopamine and dobutamine have a half-life of 2 minutes,
any change in their concentration would result in steady state
in 10 minutes, and hence, changes in their dosage should be
made every 15 minutes till the blood pressure stabilizes.

Anemia in Neonate
Nandkishor S Kabra

INTRODUCTION

{{

Anemia is one of the common hematological abnormalities
in newborn. Normal erythropoiesis in newborn is influenced
by several factors, especially erythropoietin. Erythropoietin
stimulates maturation of red blood cell (RBC) precursors.
It is defined as hemoglobin or hematocrit value that is
more than 2 standard deviations below the mean for age (Table
1 and 2).

{{

{{

{{

ETIOLOGY
Three general causes include blood loss, increased RBC
destruction, and decreased RBC production.
1. Blood loss, the commonest cause of neonatal anemia,
includes:

Obstetrical causes: placental abruption, placenta
previa, trauma to placenta or umbilical cord during
delivery, and rupture of anomalous placental vessels
Fetomaternal transfusion: 8% of normal pregnancies
have some admixture
Fetoplacental transfusion due to positioning of infant
above level of placenta after delivery, partial cord
occlusion (e.g., with nuchal or prolapsed cord).
Twin-twin transfusion: occurs only with mono­chorionic
(i.e., monozygotic) twins and when there are placental
vessels which allow shunting of blood from one twin to
the other. Donor will have anemia of variable severity and
recipient will have polycythemia of variable severity
Internal hemorrhage such as intracranial hemorrhage
(ICH), intraventricular periventricular hemorrhage,
subgaleal hemorrhage, cephalohematoma, adrenal
hemorrhage, subcapsular hematoma of liver, or
ruptured viscus (e.g., spleen)
Iatrogenic blood loss secondary to sampling of blood
for laboratory tests. This is the commonest cause of
anemia (and transfusion) in small premature infants.

CLINICAL APPROACH
History

•

•

Physical Examination
•
•

Clinical Pearl
• Anemia in neonates is the commonest hematologic abnormality.

CLINICAL FINDINGS
This will vary with the severity of anemia and other associated
conditions. The major physiologic impact of anemia is
decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, resulting in compensatory
responses and acute/chronic consequences. There may be
no signs with mild anemia. With more severe anemia, exami­
nation findings include: pallor, tachycardia, tachypnea, apnea,

Family history: anemia, jaundice, gallstones, splenec­tomy,
ethnicity
Maternal history: anemia, blood group and Rh type,
transfusions, viral exanthematous illness during pregnancy,
per vaginal bleeding, multiple gestation: twin-to-twin
transfusion, type of delivery (instrumental), complications
of labor and delivery
Neonatal history: age at onset, physical findings, to know
the cause of anemia (Table 3).

•
•
•
•

Look for cephalohematoma, subgaleal bleed, petechiae,
and overt bleeding from gastrointestinal tract and umbilical
cord
Pallor with prolong capillary refill time: tachycardia and
hypotension: acute blood loss
Pallor without signs of decompensation: chronic blood loss
Pallor, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly: chronic hemolysis
Failure to thrive may be a manifestation of chronic anemia
Examination of placenta: for evidence of hematoma,
retroplacental clots, infection, and arteriovenous anasto­
mosis in monochorionic placenta.

Clinical Pearl
• A systemic approach is required to identify exact cause of
anemia and a protocol base management is must to correct it.

Blood group and direct Coombs test
Serum bilirubin: increased levels of indirect bilirubin
suggestive of chronic hemolysis
Kleihauer-Betke test of mother’s blood: estimation of fetal
blood lost into maternal circulation can be made by using
the formula 2400 × fetal/maternal cells = mL of fetal blood,
e.g., 1/600 red cells in mother’s circulation is fetal, then

MANAGEMENT
•
•
•

Fluid resuscitation: normal saline push followed by packed
cell transfusion: acute blood loss
Treat the underlying cause, e.g., treatment of sepsis and
toxoplasmosis
Iron therapy: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 months: chronic blood loss.

• In preterm and term infants, packed red blood cells
transfusion should be considered if an immediate need for
increased oxygen delivery to tissues is clinically desired.

Red Blood Cell Transfusion
Guidelines for Premature Infants
Consider RBC transfusions in the following conditions:
• For infants requiring significant mechanical ventilation,
defined as FiO2 greater than 40% and/or pressor support if the
central hematocrit is less than 40% (hemoglobin <11 g/dL)
• For infants requiring minimal mechanical ventilation, with
FiO2 less than 35%, if the central hematocrit is less than
35% (hemoglobin <10 g/dL)
• For infants on supplemental oxygen who are not requiring
minimal mechanical ventilation, with FiO2 less than 25%, if
the central hematocrit is less than 25% (hemoglobin
<8 g/dL), one or more of the following is present:
{{ More than 24 hours of tachycardia (heart rate >180/min)
or tachypnea (respiratory rate >80 breaths per min)
{{ An increased oxygen requirement from the previous
48 hours, define as greater than fourfold increase in
nasal cannula flow (i.e., 0.25–1 L/min) or an increase
in nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
more than 20% from the previous 48 hours (i.e.,

only to replace blood lost through phlebotomy. If an
erythrocyte transfusion is not given, “blood out” may
be replaced mL for mL with 0.9% saline when 10–15 mL
of blood per kg body weight is reached, in order to avoid
hypovolemia. In addition to the saline used for the above
indication, clinicians may administer additional albumin,
fresh frozen plasma, platelet transfusions as they deem
clinically indicated. Whenever possible, RBC transfusion
should be given as 10–20 mL/kg, intravenously, infused
slowly over 3–4 hours under cardiorespiratory monitoring.
Packed RBCs volume may be restricted to 10 mL/kg in
infants perceived to be at risk of necrotizing enterocolitis
(NEC). Few studies have demonstrated that preterm very
low birth weight (VLBW) infant if kept nil by mouth during
the period of transfusion reduce the risk of transfusion
related NEC. Small packs (triple and penta packs) of blood
should be made available through blood bank for blood
transfusion.

AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY
•

•

When infants are transfused at lower hemoglobin values
for the gestational age, postnatal age, and the need for
assisted respiratory support (oxygen, CPAP, mechanical
ventilation), it is considered as restricted transfusion
approach. The use of restrictive as compared to liberal
hemoglobin thresholds in infants of VLBW results in
modest reductions in exposure to transfusion and in
hemoglobin levels. Restrictive practice does not appear to
have a significant impact on death or major morbidities at
first hospital discharge or at follow-up. However, given the
uncertainties of these conclusions, it would be prudent to
avoid hemoglobin levels below the lower limits tested in
clinical studies
Early administration of rhEPO (started before 8 days
of age) reduces the use one or more red blood cell
transfusions, the volume of RBC transfused, and the
number of donors and transfusions the infant is exposed
to following study entry. The small reductions are of
limited clinical importance.

Bleeding Neonate
Deepak Chawla

INTRODUCTION
Bleeding is an alarming symptom at any age, more so in a
young infant. Loss of blood from intravascular space may
manifest as overt bleeding like upper or lower gastrointestinal
bleeding or pulmonary hemorrhage or as covert bleeding like
intracranial hemorrhage. In addition, a neonate may manifest
bleeding tendency by development of facial purpura after
birth, prolonged bleeding from venipuncture sites and oozing
from umbilical cord. Objective of this chapter is to delineate an
approach to diagnose underlying cause and plan treatment of
a bleeding neonate.

HEMOSTASIS IN NEONATE
Knowledge of components of hemostatic system and their
physiological variation in term and preterm neonates is
essential to develop understanding of causes of bleeding
and to correctly interpret results of laboratory investigations.
Components of hemostatic system include procoagulant
factors, inhibitors of coagulation, fibrinolytic system, platelets,

and endothelium (Algorithm 1). In neonates, there is
decreased activity of procoagulant system which is balanced
by decreased activity of coagulation inhibitors and fibrinolytic
system so that a healthy term neonate does not develop
bleeding or thrombosis despite passing through birth canal
and undergoing postnatal extracellular fluid constriction
(Table 1).

Clinical Pearl
• Laboratory values of coagulant factors in neonates should
be based on gestation- and postnatal-age-based reference
values.

CAUSES OF BLEEDING IN NEONATES
Bleeding in neonates may result from decreased number or
function of platelets and specific deficiencies of coagulation
factors (Table 2). Some systemic disorders can cause more
widespread disturbance in hemostatic mechanism.

cause of early-onset thrombocytopenia. Systemic infections
are most common underlying cause of late-onset thrombo­
cytopenia.

APPROACH TO A BLEEDING NEONATE
History and Physical Examination

40

ch-10.indd 40

Detailed maternal history should be taken to rule out thrombo­
cytopenia due to immune causes. Neonatal alloimmune
thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is frequently suspected if there is
history of bleeding or thrombocytopenia in previous siblings.
Thrombocytopenia can also develop due to transplacental

passage of antibodies from a mother affected by autoimmune
thrombocytopenia or systemic lupus erythematosus.
Thrombo­cytopenia is common but rarely severe to cause
bleeding in neonates born to pregnancies complicated by
gestational hypertension; intrauterine growth restriction, or
hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and a low platelet
count syndrome. History must be sought for systemic disorders
which can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation like
birth asphyxia and neonatal sepsis. Inherited deficiencies
of coagulation factors can be suspected if parents have a
consanguineous marriage or previous siblings are affected.
Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders while
von Willebrand factor deficiency can be autosomal dominant
or recessive. Presence of skeletal abnormalities like absent
thumb or absent radius bone indicates Fanconi anemia or
thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome. Chromosomal
disorders like trisomy 13, 18, or 21 can be associated with
thrombocytopenia.

Clinical Pearl
• Detailed family history should be taken to rule out inherited or
maternal causes of bleeding in a neonate.

Gestation at birth, age at onset of bleeding, and site
of bleeding can indicate underlying cause. Bleeding in an
otherwise healthy term or late preterm neonate indicates
either coagulation factor deficiency or NAIT. Early-onset
thrombocytopenia (within 72 h of birth) in a preterm neonate
is most commonly due to maternal illness while late-onset
thrombocytopenia (after 72 h of birth) is most commonly
due to sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis. Intracranial bleed
without significant birth trauma indicates presence of
underlying bleeding disorder. Subdural hemorrhage is more
common with hemophilia while intraparenchymal bleed is
more common with thrombocytopenia (e.g., NAIT). Other
common sites of bleeding in coagulation factor deficiency
include oozing from umbilical stump, prolonged bleeding from
venipuncture or heel stick sites, large caput succedaneum, or
large cephalhematoma without birth trauma. Mucosal bleeds,
e.g., from oral mucosa or gastrointestinal bleeds, are more
commonly observed in thrombocytopenia.

Clinical Pearl
• Intracranial bleed in a term neonate should raise suspicion of
coagulation dysfunction. Mucosal bleed is most commonly
due to platelet disorders.

History should be sought about maternal intake of
medications and administration of vitamin K at birth.
Maternal intake of antitubercular or antiepileptic drugs
may be associated with development of early onset vitamin
K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) which presents within first
24 hours of birth. Neonates not receiving the recommended
dose of vitamin K at birth may develop classical (24 h to 7 days
after birth) or late onset (2–12 weeks) VKDB.

Chapter 10: Bleeding Neonate

Laboratory Investigations
Essential laboratory investigations which should be done in
neonates with bleeding include platelet count, prothrombin
time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)
and fibrinogen levels (Algorithm 2). Prothrombin time is
prolonged in deficiency of vitamin K dependent coagulation
factors (II, VII, IX, and X). Activated partial thromboplastin
time is prolonged in deficiency of vitamin K dependent
coagulation factors and deficiency of contact factors (XI, XII,
prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen). If PT,
APTT, and platelets counts are normal, bleeding may occur
because of decreased factor XIII, a2-antiplasmin activity
or abnormal platelet functions. In a sick neonate, more
widespread derangement of the laboratory markers indicates
decreased synthesis due to liver disorder or consumption
coagulopathy.

Clinical Pearl
• Initial workup in a bleeding neonate should include platelet
count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin
time, and fibrinogen levels.

Specific factor assay can be done on clinical suspicion.
However, results need to be interpreted carefully in view of
altered levels in neonates. Levels of factor VIII are comparable
to adults. Therefore, classical hemophilia can be diagnosed in
neonates. On the other hand, levels of factor IX are about 15%
of adult level and, therefore, hemophilia B can be diagnosed
only by 6–12 months of age, when levels reach the adult range.
Prothrombin time and APTT are influenced by ratio of blood
and citrate in the sample; therefore, care must be taken while
withdrawing the sample.
Additional laboratory investigations may be warranted
as per clinical suspicion. For example, severe early-onset
thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000/µL) in a preterm

neonate may be because of congenital infections for which
appropriate diagnostic test should be done. Conversely,
mild early-onset transient thrombocytopenia in a small-forgestation neonate may be because of gestational hyper­tension
in mother and no further investigations are needed.

MANAGEMENT
Thrombocytopenia
Management of thrombocytopenia consists of treating
underlying cause and if needed giving platelet transfusion.
In case of NAIT, platelet transfusion is indicated if platelet
counts are below 30,000/µL. In case of active bleeding, platelet
transfusion can be given if platelet count is below 50,000/µL.
If available, single donor platelets which are human platelet
antigen compatible with the neonate are preferred. If these
are not available without delay, random donor platelets can be
transfused. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (1
g/kg for 2 days or 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) may increase platelet
count in immune thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts need to
be monitored for first 10–14 days after birth.
Due to lack of demonstrable efficacy in preventing serious
hemorrhages, threshold platelet count below which platelet
transfusion is given has become more stringent with time.
Most of neonates with platelet count above 20,000/µL will not
develop a serious bleed. Therefore, this cutoff may be used in
otherwise healthy neonates with thrombocytopenia. Higher
cutoff of 30,000/µL may be used in neonates at higher risk of
bleeding which include extremely low birthweight neonates
in their first week after birth, unstable blood pressure records,
previously existing grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage,
current minor bleeds, coexisting coagulopathy or before
exchange transfusion or surgery. In case of active major
bleeding, platelet count may be maintained above 50,000/µL.
Platelets can be obtained by pooling from multiple donors
(platelet concentrate) or by apheresis from a single donor

(apheresis unit). It is stored at room temperature and has a
shelf-life of 5 days. A dose of 10 mL/kg is usually sufficient to
increase the platelet count above therapeutic threshold.

Clinical Pearl
• Platelet count should be maintained above 50,000/µL in
a neonate with active bleeding and above 30,000/µL in a
neonate without active bleeding.

Coagulopathy
Vitamin K deficiency can be treated by administration of
vitamin K by subcutaneous or intravenous route. Effect of
parenteral vitamin K starts within 4 hours. In case of active
bleeding, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be administered.
In case of classical hemophilia, treatment of choice is
administration of factor VIII concentrate. If not available,
cryoprecipitate or FFP can be given. Dose of cryoprecipitate
is 2 mL/kg or I unit/7 kg. Fresh frozen plasma can be
administered in a dose of 10-20 mL/kg. Specific deficiencies
of other coagulation factors are rare and can be managed by
administration of cryoprecipitate or FFP.
Supportive and specific care for underlying systemic
causes of bleeding like sepsis and NEC should be given.

Key points

))
In neonates, coagulation cascade remains same as pediatric
patients, while causes for bleeding differ. It involves factors
related to maternal causes and intrapartum insults
))
Laboratory values of coagulation factors are different than
adults
))
Platelet and component therapy should be used very
judiciously. Clinical status need be considered while planning
for the transfusions.

Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia
(Unconjugated)
Poonam Sidana, Gaurav Mandhan

INTRODUCTION
Unconjugated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NNH) is one of
the commonest problems faced by pediatricians attending to
neonates. Incidence is reported as 60% in term and around
80% in preterm neonates. Incidence and severity are inversely
related to gestational age at birth. It is a benign condition which
resolves by itself in most of the cases. However, neurotoxic
potential of the unconjugated bilirubin which can result in
permanent neurodevelopmental sequelae in some neonates is
well known. Hence, it is necessary that all those neonates who
are at high risk are identified and managed appropriately.

Table 1: Differentiating points for various categories of un­
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia

Clinical Pearl
• There is no single level of serum bilirubin which applies to
all the babies. Instead, various nomograms are available to
evaluate risk and decide intervention for a particular neonate.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may be categorized
as physiological/pathological or exaggerated physiological.
For a clinician, it is important to know how to differentiate
between these categories. Also it is extremely important to
decide which babies are at risk of developing NNH level that
may need investigations and/or intervention. Table 1 lists
some important differentiating points for various categories.

EXAGGERATED PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE
Time of appearance and rate of rise does not match that of
pathological jaundice. However, absolute total serum bilirubin
value tends to be higher than that expected for physiological
jaundice. Investigations do not reveal any specific cause.
Following groups of neonates are more prone to develop
significant NNH.

TREATMENT
In an ideal situation, treatment guidelines should be based
on epidemiological data collected from a local population. In
India, in view of paucity of any national database on neonatal
jaundice, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines
(2004) for NNH management have been followed for the last
many years. These guidelines do not address treatment of
newborns born less than 35 weeks of gestation.
Recently published guidelines by National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2010 are more
inclusive, as they have evaluated data from diverse sources,
including AAP 2004 guidelines and few Indian studies also.
These guidelines are applicable to neonates born from 23 weeks’
gestation onward, till term. There are graphs available for each
gestation outlining phototherapy and exchange thresholds
from birth itself. Management of jaundice appearing within
first 24 hours of life has been addressed clearly.
Tables 3 and 4 and algorithm 1 represent the adaptations
from NICE guidelines 2010 for the management of neonatal
jaundice.

Clinical Pearl
• All infants discharged at less than 72 hours should be seen
within 2 days of discharge to ensure diagnosis of pathological
jaundice.

INVESTIGATIONS
The following investigations may be done, in the order of
priority, depending on clinical evaluation:
• Serum bilirubin, total and conjugated, can use trans­
cutaneous bilirubin if baby >35 weeks/>24 h/not under
phototherapy
• Blood group of the baby and the mother
• Direct Coombs test in Rh isoimmunized/ABO in­
compatibility
• Hemogram, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear for
hemolysis/red blood cell morphology

Hypoglycemia
Sailesh G Gupta

INTRODUCTION

METHODS OF GLUCOSE ESTIMATION

There is no universal definition for hypoglycemia. The normal
range of blood glucose (BG) is variable and depends upon
factor like birthweight, gestational age, body store, feeding
status, as well as the presence or absence of the disease.
Operational threshold has been defined as that
concentration of plasma or whole BG at which clinician
should consider intervention based on the currently available
literature. Operational threshold has been defined as BG level
less than 40 mg/dL (plasma glucose level <45 mg/dL).

SCREENING OF BABIES (WHO ARE AT RISK)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Preterm infants
Small for gestational age
Large for gestational age
Infant of diabetic mother
Sick infants (e.g., sepsis, birth asphyxia, shock, poly­
cythemia, etc.)
Infants on intravenous fluids and total parenteral nutrition
Mother receiving drugs like, b-blocker, oral hypo­glycemic,
and received intrapartum glucose infusion.

Important point in BG estimation is whole blood sugar is
10–15% lower than the plasma glucose. Glucose oxidase and
glucose electrode method are two most commonly used
method for BG estimation in laboratory which are accurate
and reliable. Samples should be analyzed quickly as BG values
drops by 14–18 mg/dL/h of storage.

Babies on IVF and TPN

IVF, intravenous fluids; TPN, total parenteral nutrition.

ch-12.indd 47

•

All symptomatic hypoglycemia infants should be treated
with intravenous fluids
A bolus of 2 mL/kg of 10% dextrose is given intravenously
after sending a lab sample for confirmation of diagnosis
Following a bolus of 10% dextrose continuous glucose
infusion should be started at glucose infusion rate (GIR) of
6 mg/kg/min
Blood glucose should be checked 15–30 minutes after
giving intravenous 10% dextrose bolus. If it stays greater
than 50 mg/dL then decrease frequency of monitoring
from every hour to 4–6 hourly
If BG is less than 50 mg/dL then GIR should be increased
in the increment of 2 mg/kg/min every 15–30 minutes until
BG is greater than 50 mg/dL or GIR reaches 12 mg/kg/min
After BG values stabilized for greater than 50 mg/dL for at
least 24 hours, then only tapering of GIR should be started
at 2 mg/kg/min every 6 hourly with BG monitoring. It
should be accompanied by concomitant increase in oral
feeds. Once GIR of 4 mg/kg/min is achieved and infant is
tolerating oral feeds and BG is greater than 50 mg/dL then
only glucose infusion should be stopped.
Do not stop glucose infusion abruptly as it can cause
rebound hypoglycemia. Maximum 12.5% dextrose can
be given through peripheral line due to risk of thrombo­
phlebitis.

MANAGEMENT OF
ASYMPTOMATIC HYPOGLYCEMIA

MANAGEMENT OF
REFRACTORY HYPOGLYCEMIA

Often low blood glucose level (BGL) may not manifest clinically
and maybe without any symptoms. Asymptomatic hypo­
glycemia is defined as a condition with BGL of <45 mg/dL
(confirmed in laboratory) with the infant not manifesting
clinical features. Unanimous opinion does not exist for the need
to treat asymptomatic infants with low BGL. Management of
asymptomatic hypoglycemia is summarized in table 2.
tABLE 2: Management plan of infants with asymptomatic hypo­
glycemia
Condition

Timing

Blood sugar
20–45 mg/dL

Try oral feeds (expressed breast milk or infant
formula) and repeat BGL after 1 hr:
• If BGL >45 mg/dL, then provide 2 h oral feeds
and measure BGL 6 h for 48 h. Aim to maintain
BGL between 50 mg/dL and 120 mg/dL
• If BGL <45 mg/dL, start IV dextrose infusion
and manager as per protocol for symptomatic
hypoglycemia
Start IV Dextrose at 6 mg/kg/min. Subsequently
manage as symptomatic hypoglycemia

Blood sugar
<20 mg/dL

Definitions
Unable to achieve normal BG despite giving glucose infusion at
12 mg/kg/min or hypoglycemia remains for more than 7 days
then it’s considered to be refractory hypoglycemia.
Important causes
• Hyperinsulinemic states
• Congenital hypopituitarism
• Adrenal insufficiency
• Metabolic disorders like galactosemia, fatty acid oxidation
defects, organic acidemias, etc.

Critical Sample in
Management of Refractory Hypoglycemia

•

Serum insulin level
Serum cortisol
Serum ammonia
Serum ketone bodies
Serum lactate.
Other secondary investigations can be done according to
the etiology suspected.

times a day.

Key points

))
A BGL <40 mg/dL or plasma GL <45 mg/dL is considered the
operational threshold for management of Hypoglycemia in a
Newborn
))
Newborns ‘at risk’ for Hypoglycemia should be screened
clinically and by measurement of BGL to diagnose
asymptomatic and symptomatic hypoglycemia
))
All symptomatic hypoglycemia should be treated with
Intravenous bolus of 10% dextrose followed by dextrose
infusion at the rate 6 mg/Kg/min, and frequent monitoring
of BGL. For BGL <50 mg/dL, the infusion rate is increased
by 2 mg/Kg/min, until an infusion rate of 12 mg/Kg/min is

reached. The dextrose infusion should be tapered gradually
only after BGL stabilizes above 50 mg/dL for 24 hours. Abrupt
cessation of infusion can cause rebound hypoglycemia
))
Hypoglycemia without clinical manifestations should be
treated with IV dextrose infusion if BGL <25 mg/dL. With BGL
>25 mg/dL, oral feeding of milk is followed 30 min later, by
BGL measurement. If BGL >45 mg/dL, oral feeding and 6 h
BGL monitoring are done. If BGL <45 mg/dL, a dextrose bolus
of 10% at 2 ml/kg is given and followed up with management
as for symptomatic hypoglycemia
))
Inability of achieve BGL >50 mg/dL after dextrose infusion
rate of 12 mg/Kg/min, or hypoglycemia lasting over a week
is labeled as refractory. Causes should be explored, and
treatment may include the use of drugs appropriate to the
cause of refractory hypoglycemia.

Neonatal Seizures
Sanjay Wazir

INTRODUCTION
Neonatal seizures represent one of the major challenges
for the clinician working in nursery because of difficulty in
diagnosis and lack of effective evidence based treatment
scheme. Incidence of neonatal seizures is inversely
proportional to the birthweight with incidence of approxi­
mately 60 per 1,000 at less than 1,500 g and 3 per 1,000 at more
than 2,500 g at birth.

PROGNOSIS
Dependent on the cause of seizures, e.g., in case of late-onset
hypocalcemia, the outcome is 100% normal and in case of
cerebral malformation, nearly all would have a bad prognosis.
Some of the outcomes are listed in table 5.

Multiple rather than single factors appear to be most
accurate in predicting outcome. However, all these variables
ultimately are related to the degree of brain injury at the time
of seizure occurrence, and, in turn, the seizure etiology.

Neonatal Sepsis
Rahul P Bhamkar, Anjali Kulkarni

INTRODUCTION

Table 2: Risk factors for sepsis

Neonatal sepsis is the commonest cause of mortality and
morbidity in newborns in our country. It can be divided into
two categories based on the onset.

CLASSIFICATION
Etiology-wise, sepsis can be classified as bacterial and fungal
sepsis.
• Bacterial sepsis: presents both as early onset sepsis (EOS)
and late onset sepsis (LOS)
• Fungal sepsis: presents commonly as LOS.
The difference between early and late onset sepsis is given
in table 1.
Table 1: Classification of sepsis
Early onset sepsis (<72 h)
• Caused by organisms
acquired before or
immediately after birth
(vertical infection)
• Predominantly respiratory
presentation

Late onset sepsis (>72 h)
• Caused by organisms
acquired from hospital or
community
• Varied presentation

RISK FACTORS FOR SEPSIS
Risk factors for sepsis are given in table 2.

ORGANISMS IN NEONATAL SEPSIS
According to the National Neonatal Perinatal Database data
2002–2003, K. pneumoniae was the commonest (30.1%),
followed by S. aureus (16.2%), E. coli (13%) and Pseudomonas sp.
(9.3%). The organisms are similar in both EOS and LOS in Indian
scenario according to this report.

ch-14.indd 54

Early onset sepsis

Late onset sepsis

Maternal factors
• Prolonged rupture of membranes
>18 h*
• Intrapartum maternal fever >38°C
within 15 days*
• Foul smelling liquor*
• Chorioamnionitis*
• Unclean vaginal examination
• Maternal leukocytosis (WBC >15000)
• Prolonged rupture of membrane >12 h
• Frequent (>3) per vaginal examination
in labor
• Vaginal positive swab for group B
streptococcus
Fetal factors
• Fetal distress: sustained fetal
tachycardia >160/min*
• APGAR <5
• Low birth weight (<1500 g)
• Prematurity <34 weeks

• Neonatal intensive
care unit admission
• Poor hygiene
• Low and very low
birthweight babies
• Poor cord care
• Prematurity
• Bottle feeding
• Invasive procedure
• Superficial infection
(pyoderma,
umbilical sepsis)
• Fungal sepsis:
exposure to broadspectrum antibiotics
causing alteration of
normal flora

penia (<6,000), persistent thrombocytopenia
Immature to total neutrophil ratio: increase in immature to
total white cell ratio greater than 0.3 is 85% sensitive and
specific, particularly for EOS
C-reactive protein: rises approximately 12 hours after onset
of sepsis and returns to normal within 2–7 days. Greater than
1 mg/dL indicates sepsis. Sensitivity 85% and specificity 90%.
C-reactive protein has low negative predictive value in EOS
Procalcitonin: greater than 0.25–2 ng/L suggests sepsis;
greater than 2 ng/mL, strong suspicion of sepsis
Blood culture: gold standard in diagnosis till date
Chest X-ray if respiratory distress
Lumber puncture: should be performed when index of
suspicion of meningitis is high in EOS and in all cases of LOS.

Specific Treatment
All babies with presence of risk factors and/or with signs and
symptoms of sepsis should be screened for sepsis and blood
culture should be collected. Pending blood culture report
babies should be judiciously started on antibiotics.

Antibiotics
For practical purpose, antibiotics can be classified as:
• First-line antibiotics: ampicillin plus gentamicin
• Second-line antibiotics: third or fourth generation cep­
halosporin/piperacillin plus tazobactum plus amikacin
• Third-line antibiotics: carbapenams plus amikacin
• Fourth-line antibiotics: polymyxin/colistin/vancomycin/
linezolid.
Choice of antibiotics should be judiciously decided
(Table 3). For suspected LOS, it is justified to start directly on
second-line antibiotics. In EOS if high vaginal swab positive,
neonate should be treated with specific antibiotics as per
culture and sensitivity report. If mother is positive for group
B streptococcus then double dose of ampicillin should be
used.

Clinical Pearl

Clinical Pearls
• Blood culture should always be obtained before starting
antibiotic therapy, but inability to obtain blood culture should
not delay starting of treatment.
• Neutropenia in face of confirmed sepsis indicate that baby is
extremely unwell.

• Consideration of fungal sepsis should be given for very
low birthweight babies, especially with central lines who
deteriorate on antibiotics. Fluconazole prophylaxis in such
babies has shown to reduce the incidence of invasive fungal
sepsis. In babies with pending culture report, it is justified to
start antifungal treatment..

Stopping Antibiotics
Guidelines for stopping antibiotics are illustrated in
algorithm 3. Duration of antibiotics depends upon clinical
condition of the infant and organism identified. If septic screen
and blood culture is negative and baby is asymptomatic or
symptoms resolved, antibiotics can be stopped after 48 hours.
If blood culture is negative and clinical suspicion is high,
repeat blood culture and CRP; continue antibiotics for 7–10
days till infective indices have normalized. For proven sepsis
with normal cerebrospinal fluid findings, treatment should be
at least 10–14 days and for meningitis, treatment should be for
21 days. For fungal sepsis, treatment duration is 3–6 weeks or
21 days after first negative blood culture.

Adjunctive Therapies in Sepsis
The following treatments have been tried with varying results but
there is no evidence-based recommendation for any of these.

Approach to
Congenital Heart Disease
Dinesh K Chirla, Preetham K Poddutoor

INTRODUCTION

Table 2: Causes and frequency of congenital heart disease

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is found in 7–8 per 100 live
births. It may occur as an isolated defect or in association with
other malformations such as esophageal atresia, anorectal
malformation, exomphalos, and skeletal defects.
About 10–15% have complex lesion with more than one
cardiac abnormality and 10–15% have noncardiac abnormality.
The most common congenital anomalies are given in table 1.

Clinical Pearl
• The nine most common congenital anomalies account for
80% of all lesions.

Congenital heart disease is particularly common in
chromosomal disorders and with some maternal conditions.
A neonate should be suspected and evaluated for CHD in the
following conditions (Table 2 and Algorithm 1).
Newborn with CHD presents if there is:
• Unfavorable transitional circulation where the circulation
is parallel instead of being in series
• Obstruction of series circulation and patent ductus
arteriosus closes
• Fall in pulmonary vascular resistance and shunting and
mixing occurs.
Initial evaluation would include assessment of perfusion,
oxygen saturation, pulses, and blood pressure measurements.

ANTENATAL DIAGNOSIS
Checking the anatomy of fetal heart has become a routine
part of the fetal anomaly scan (targeted imaging for fetal
anomalies) at 18–20 weeks in most of the fetal medicine units.
If an abnormality is detected, detailed fetal echocardiography
is performed by pediatric cardiologists (Algorithm 2).
Unfortunately, these services are available only in few tertiary

structural heart disease:
• Murmur intensity grade 3 or higher
• Harsh quality
• Pansystolic duration
• Loudest at upper left, upper right sternal border, or apex
• Abnormal S2.

some choose termination of pregnancy in complex CHD;
majority can continue with pregnancy and have neonates
management planned antenatally.

Clinical Pearl
• Neonates with duct-dependent lesion are likely to need
treatment in the first 2 days.

Pathologic Murmurs
The intensity and quality of the murmur and associated
findings differentiate innocent murmurs from those associated
with heart disease.

ch-15.indd 59

Much more threatening than a murmur is the presence of
cyanosis. Peripheral cyanosis may occur when a neonate is cold
or unwell from any cause. Central cyanosis is seen on tongue.
Cyanosis without pulmonary disease is almost invariably
the result of a serious cardiac abnormality. Clinically, it is
sometimes difficult to identify cyanosis differentiating between
cardiac and pulmonary cyanosis see (Table 3); always check
oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry. Those with left-sided
obstructive lesions present with inadequate systemic perfusion
and shock, whereas those with right-sided lesions present with
cyanosis because of inadequate blood reaching the lungs. In
neonatal period, cardiac cyanosis may be caused by:
• Reduced pulmonary blood flow
{{ Critical pulmonary stenosis
{{ Tetralogy of Fallot
{{ Tricuspid atresia/Ebstein’s
• Poor mixing/separate parallel systemic and pulmonary
circulation
{{ Transposition of great vessels
• Common mixing of systemic venous and pulmonary
venous blood

Neonate with cardiogenic shock

Heart Failure
Heart failure in neonatal period usually results from left heart
obstruction, e.g., coarctation of aorta. If the obstruction is severe
then arterial perfusion is predominantly via arterial duct (right
to left flow) so called duct-dependent systemic circulation.

Shock

60

ch-15.indd 60

A variety of mechanisms can lead to cardiogenic shock
in newborns with duct-dependent CHD when the ductus
arteriosus closes (Algorithm 3):
• In left heart obstructive lesions (e.g., hypoplastic left heart
syndrome, critical aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta,
and interrupted aortic arch), systemic perfusion is lost
• In right-sided obstructive lesions (e.g., total anomalous
pulmonary venous connection, tricuspid atresia and mitral
atresia), restricted pulmonary blood flow results in reduced
systemic blood flow, which may result in shock

In lesions with parallel pulmonary and systemic
circulations (e.g., transposition of the great arteries with
intact ventricular septum), mixing between the two
circulations is decreased, leading to hypoxia and metabolic
acidosis, which results in failure and shock
Cardiogenic shock must be differentiated from other
causes of shock, such as sepsis. In newborns who present
with shock, cardiomegaly is a helpful finding indicating a
cardiac etiology.

First Golden Hour
Management of Preterm
Naveen Bajaj

INTRODUCTION
The term “golden hour” has been taken from the adult trauma
treatment arena in which the best time frame to prevent
irreversible internal damage and optimize the chance of
survival is the first hour of management. Neonates especially
very low birth weight (VLBW) and preterm babies of less
than or equal to 32 weeks of gestation are highly vulnerable
to many disease in the first hours of life when adaptation is
critical and timing of care affects survival and long-term
outcome. Delivery room management that focuses on
adaptation of these infants, as well as early interventions in
first hour of life that improve long-term outcomes, emphasize
the importance of this ‘golden hour’” of care in this extremely
vulnerable population of preterms and VLBW babies.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
IN PRETERM NEONATES
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Poor thermal control
Poor energy stores
Poor respiratory drive
Surfactant deficiency
Susceptibility to intraventricular hemorrhage and
periventricular leukomalacia
Often born after a complication of pregnancy like
antepartum hemorrhage, intrauterine growth restriction,
infection, etc.
Stressed family.

AIM OF GOLDEN HOUR
•
•

ch-16.indd 63

To optimize the survival free of disability in preterm infants
(≤32 weeks) and VLBW by providing optimal interventions
in the first few hours of life
To undertake all nursing and medical procedures as quickly
and with as little disturbance to the infant as possible,
usually within 1 hour of admission.

Clinical Pearl
• Consistencies in golden hour stabilization practices improve
neonatal outcome in preterm and very low birth weight
babies.

BASIC PRINCIPLES
•
•
•
•

Lung protection
Brain protection
Minimize damage to other organs
Early nutrition.
Techniques included in the golden hour stabilization
practices are:
• Thermoregulation
• Resuscitation as per Neonatal Resuscitation Program
guidelines
• Respiratory management
{{ Oxygen targeting
{{ Administering positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
{{ Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) venti­
lation
{{ Nasal ventilator strategies to an infant in the delivery
room to reduce intubations
{{ Early identifications of those infants who need
surfactant and mechanical ventilation
• Fluid and nutrition
• Treatment and prevention of infections
• Developmentally supportive care
• Family centered care.

Clinical Pearl
• Thermoregulation, respiratory, and nutrition practices
constitute the most important aspect of first golden hour.

Chapter 16: First Golden Hour Management of Preterm
•
•
•

On admission to NICU, weigh infant in the polyethylene bag
Use incubator in less than or equal to 28 week baby,
and remove bag on admission regardless of admission
temperature
If using radiant warmer and admission temperature
less than 37°C, leave in bag until procedures such as line
insertion is completed and then remove bag. If using
radiant heat source and admission temperature is greater
than or equal to 37°C, remove bag. Place a skin temperature
probe to avoid extremes in temperature.

•
•

•

Clinical Pearl
• In extreme preterms, additional measures like use of polythene
bag in delivery room and transportation of infant in incubator
is desired to prevent hypothermia in early hour.

Respiratory Support (Algorithm 2)
Goals of treatment is to use the least amount of intervention
necessary to support normal gas exchange while minimizing
lung injury by early intervention, optimizing lung recruitment
by using high PEEP and avoiding lung overdistention (low tidal
volume 5–6 mL/kg).
• Use air/oxygen blender for resuscitation
• Use pulse oximetry and target saturations to guide to
inspired oxygen concentration

•
•
•

Intubation and prophylactic surfactant is the best
supported approach to the initial respiratory management
of the most preterm infants of less than 26 weeks
Infants of greater than or equal to 26–28 weeks may be
best managed with prophylactic surfactant and rapid
extubation to nasal CPAP or early elective nasal CPAP with
selective surfactant treatment depending upon institution
policy
More mature preterm infants of greater than 28 weeks
may be best managed with early elective nasal CPAP
with selective surfactant treatment, If a preterm infant is
managed initially with nasal CPAP, surfactant is given if
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) requirement increases
to 0.30–0.40 with X-ray showing respiratory distress
syndrome
Acceptable oxygen saturations in preterm newborns in
delivery room are given in table 1
In NICU, maintain pulse oxygen saturation SpO2 88–92%
Acceptable arterial blood gas: pH = 7.25–7.35; partial
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) = 40–50 mmHg;
partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) = 50–70 mmHg.

Clinical Pearl
• Prophylactic/early surfactant and nasal continuous positive
airway pressure practices are aimed to minimize lung injury.

• Parental stress needs to be addressed by the treating physician.

The goal is to prevent hypoglycemia but also fluid overload.
• Start fluids 60–100 mL/kg depending upon the gestational
age
• Start D10% with amino acids [total parenteral nutrition
(TPN) starter bag] as the first fluid
• Prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
• Monitor electrolytes and correct acidosis
• Avoid volume overload
• If hypotensive, start dopamine after one fluid bolus of
10 mL/kg

Considerable stress response has been associated with
normal birth and high risk (preterm) neonates may be
particularly susceptible to stressors because of frequent
painful procedures and constant exposure to noxious
sensory inputs which are auditory, visual, tactile, and
chemosensory in nature in NICU.
Sound
{{ Minimize unnecessary conversation
{{ Keep voices low
{{ Silence or keep alarms at low volume
Light

Perinatal Hypoxia
Ashish Jain, Veeraraja B Sathenahalli

INTRODUCTION

CLINICAL EVALUATION

Perinatal hypoxia/asphyxia is a common major health problem
causing morbidity and mortality in neonates. According to
National Neonatal-Perinatal Database, perinatal hypoxia is
the most common cause of stillbirth accounting up to 45% of
cases and is one among the three leading causes of neonatal
mortality. This denotes the magnitude of this serious clinical
condition. Cautious monitoring and management of a neonate
with perinatal hypoxia is an area of importance. Guidelines on
clinical approach and management may help in improving the
outcome. The management of perinatal hypoxia is evolving
day by day with better understanding of its pathophysiology.

DEFINITIONS
The definitions of perinatal hypoxia vary from context to context.
Thus, there is no single definition of perinatal hypoxia.
National Neonatal-Perinatal Database defines perinatal
hypoxia/asphyxia as moderate when there is slow/gasping
breathing or an Apgar score of 4–6 at 1 minute and severe if no
breathing or an Apgar score of 0–3 at 1 minute of age.
American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology require presence of all of following
criteria to define perinatal asphyxia:
• Profound metabolic or mixed acidemia (pH <7.0) in
umbilical cord blood
• Persistence of low Apgar scores less than 3 for more than
5 minutes
• Signs of neonatal neurologic dysfunction (e.g., seizures,
encephalopathy, tone abnormalities)
• Evidence of multiple organ involvement (such as that of
kidneys, lungs, liver, heart, and intestine).

Clinical Pearl
• No definition of perinatal asphyxia is complete, all the
definitions have limitations. The definition which is feasible
and sensitive should be used.

ch-17.indd 67

Subsequent to the resuscitation of the baby, the postasphyxiated newborn should undergo a detailed clinical evalua­
tion, as this neonate is prone for multiorgan dysfunction as
perinatal hypoxia virtually affects every organ system. Further
management and outcome varies on the severity of organ
dysfunction. There are several scoring systems that have being
used. A scoring system that can be specifically followed for that
setting should be used. Some of the scoring system would need
an electroencephalography (EEG) and other investigations on
the baby. The most commonly used systems are:
• Sarnat and Sarnat staging system—a descriptive staging
system
• Levene staging system—a simpler, practical staging system
• Thompson scoring system.
The babies who have mild stage of the disease (Thompson
score <10) are almost free of any neurodevelopmental
sequelae, however, the babies with moderate and severe
stage of encephalopathy (Thompson score >10 and >15) may
have a neurodevelopmental impairment in 25% and 95% of
cases, respectively. A non-progressing score is also reassuring
and has a better outcome; hence the serial examination is
important on day to day basis for the first 7 days.

Clinical Pearls
• Staging/scoring system is vital in management of hypoxicischemic encephalopathy. Blood gas and electroencep­
halogram should be done wherever the facility is available
• These systems though vital in management, a single time
finding should not be used as criteria to prognosticate
parents about baby. It is suggested to serially follow up and
prognosticate about the baby accordingly.

MONITORING
Neonates with moderate and severe encephalopathy are to
be shifted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for further

management. However, neonates with mild encephalopathy
should be monitored at regular intervals for signs of advanced
stages of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The clinical
features of HIE vary over time. The window period between
these stages can be used for therapeutic intervention. Strict
clinical monitoring will help in management of these neonates.
Perinatal hypoxia affects virtually every organ system mainly
renal, central nervous system and cardiac. The clinical features
of organ dysfunction should be looked for. Organ system
dysfunction seen in perinatal hypoxia is given in table 1.

MANAGEMENT
The management is mainly supportive and comprises of
cardiac, respiratory, metabolic, and neurological support in
the form of maintaining optimum saturation, perfusion, blood
sugar, calcium levels, and control of seizures.

Delivery Room Management

transferred to NICU for further management. A neonate with
mild hypoxia is transferred to mother’s side and monitored

Severe

frequently for the next 48–72 hours for development of any
features of HIE (Table 2).

Management in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
Management of moderate to severe hypoxia consists of
clinical, lab monitoring at regular intervals, and maintaining
the physiology, viz., temperature, oxygenation, fluid, and
electrolyte status. Any complications like seizures are promptly
managed. Clinical parameters like heart rate, respiratory
rate, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), temperature, blood
pressure, capillary refill time, urine output, and neurological
examinations for the signs of HIE should be monitored at
regular intervals. Laboratory parameters to be monitored
include blood sugar, blood gas, urine osmolality, serum
electrolytes, and renal function tests at regular intervals. Other
parameters like electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray should be
done in clinically indicated babies.
Important management guidelines for care in NICU are
discussed below.

Assisted ventilation should be provided in case of apnea

Permissive hypercarbia is allowed
Maintain fluid and electrolyte status by judicious use
of fluids. Where tissue perfusion is poor, consider fluid
bolus and inotrope support (dopamine and dobutamine).
Dobutamine is a better choice as the peripheral vascular
resistance in these babies is already high. Restricted
fluid administration as a routine is not advised as it
may predispose the baby to hypotension. Restrict fluid
only if there is hyponatremia (sodium <120 mg/dL) due
to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
secretion and in cases of acute renal failure. Hypoxia
may cause injury to heart affecting its contractility. This
can be assessed using echocardiography and managed
accordingly
Maintain normal metabolic milieu by frequent monitoring
of blood sugar. Serum calcium is monitored regularly. It is
recommended to administer calcium in maintenance dose
to all severely hypoxic for 2 days so as to maintain calcium
in normal range
Seizures are serious manifestation of HIE (Stage II HIE).
Hypoxic seizures usually occur in the first 12–24 hours.
These may be subtle or evident prominently. Electro­
encephalogram recording will help to identify subclinical
seizures. Any metabolic disturbances like hypoglycemia,
hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia should be corrected.

Specific Therapy
Treatment of seizures: phenobarbitone is the initial drug of
choice. Loading dose of 20 mg/kg followed by 2 additional
boluses of 10 mg/kg if seizures continue. Maintenance dose of
3–5 mg/kg/day is started after 24 hours. Monitor for respiratory
depression during loading doses.
Phenytoin is added to seizures uncontrolled by pheno­
barbitone. Loading dose is 15–20 mg/kg and maintenance
dose is 4–8 mg/kg/day.

ch-17.indd 69

Benzodiazepines are third-line drugs. Lorazepam is
advised in doses of 0.05–0.1 mg/kg/dose intravenously. In
refractory cases, consider use of investigations like EEG,
cranial ultrasonography, computed tomography scan, and
magnetic resonance imaging brain to evaluate for neural
injuries.
Long-term seizure management: it is based on clinical exam
and EEG. If clinical exam and EEG are normal, anticonvulsant
can be weaned. If on more than one anticonvulsant, the last
anticonvulsant is weaned first. If any of the two are found to
be abnormal, then the anticonvulsant is continued for 1 month
and baby reassessed at 1 month. Newborns with neurological
deficit/sequelae and abnormal EEG are at risk of recurrent
seizures and may require long-term anticonvulsant therapy.
• Cardiac support: fluid bolus and inotrope are advised to
maintain adequate perfusion
• It is advised to withhold feeds until all parameters are
stable
• Hematologic, hepatic, and pulmonary derangements are
managed accordingly.

Therapeutic Hypothermia
This is now emerging as a novel therapy in babies with peri­
natal asphyxia to prevent the death and neurodevelopmental
impairment. This mode is used in infants of 36 weeks gestation
or more with moderate to severe encephalopathy. It consists
of moderate use of therapeutic hypothermia (33–34°C) within
4 hours of life. It has shown reduction in combined outcome
of mortality or major neurodevelopmental sequelae within
6 hours of life and continued for 72 hours of age.

Clinical Pearls
• Metabolic cause should be ruled out while managing seizures
in a neonate with perinatal hypoxia
• Monitoring and management of multisystems is a key factor in
prognosis of the baby.

Key points

))
Good antenatal care and prompt neonatal resuscitation are
essential for prevention of perinatal hypoxia. However, in the
event of a baby suffering from hypoxia at birth, adequate
supportive care and specific management can reduce the
mortality and long-term morbidity provided there is least
possible delay in starting the treatment
))
A system of staging like Levene staging system, a practical and
easy to use system or others, like Thompson score, should be
used in every case for better management and prognostication
))
Therapeutic hypothermia is an emerging mode of therapy in
the management of an asphyxiated baby with better longterm outcome
))
The early prediction of the complications and supportive
management forms the cornerstone in the management of
a baby with perinatal asphyxia.

Teen Pregnancy and
Contraception
Prema Raghunathan

Introduction
Adolescents compromise about 26% of Indian population.
According to National Family Health Survey-3, 16% of women
in age group 15–19 years have at least one child ever born.
Only 8% of women and 15% of men know about emergency
contraception. Among this, a significant number is contributed
by married adolescents in India, most other teens have sexual
relationships due to peer pressure or impulsivity. Teen
pregnancies are higher in India than even in United Kingdom
(UK), United States (US). The rate of birth among adolescents
in US is about 13% of all births. Adolescents have limited
education on sexuality, even if they are sexually active.
The increasing rates of teen pregnancies and abortion
causes increased medical expenditure as most of these
pregnancies are unplanned. They are also mostly seen in
underprivileged society. Teen pregnancies push an adolescent
to become school dropout, face lot of stress, and can succumb to
psychological trauma. Hence, clinicians caring for adolescents
should step in to provide sexual education (safe sex) and
contraceptive counseling as part of reproductive health.

CONTRACEPTION
Contraception counseling is an important aspect of teen
care. The first step is to identify adolescent who are sexually
active (maintain confidentiality) and the ones who follow
abstinence. The caregivers, parents, adolescent specialist
should support adolescents who follow abstinence as
“abstinence is the best method of contraception”. If the teen
is sexually active, contraceptive counseling should be given
to understand the adolescent’s perception and misperception
about contraceptives, risks of unprotected intercourse,
educate regarding real risks, and contraindications for various
methods available. Once the contraceptive method is chosen
by the adolescent, the provider must discuss the common side
effects, realistic expectation for failure, a contingency plan for
that possibility, and strategies for close follow-up.

ch-18.indd 71

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
stipulate that a routine pelvic examination with Pap smear
be initiated 3 years after onset of sexual activity and annual
screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
The various contraceptive methods are broadly classified
into hormonal (Table 1), nonhormonal (Table 2), and emergency
contraception. The nonhormonal methods are barrier methods,
spermicides, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). The hormonal
methods are combination pills or progesterone-only pills.

Nonhormonal Methods
Barrier Method
Condoms: it prevents sperms from being deposited in the
vagina (Fig 1). The advantages are:
• There are no major side effects
• Risk of STIs reduced (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome and human papillomavirus)
• Low cost, easy availability
• Little need for advanced planning.
A female condom is second choice over male condom due
to its complexity of properly using device, its low typical efficacy
rate, and lack of studies on effectiveness in STIs. Diaphragm
and cervical caps are messy and less used by teenagers.

Spermicides
These are available as foam, cream, films, or effervescent
vaginal suppositories containing nonoxynol-9. They must be
placed in vaginal cavity shortly before intercourse.

Combination Methods
Use of condom by male and spermicidal foam by female
adolescent is extremely effective and failure rate is 2%.

Hormonal Methods
Estrogenic substances in combination with a progestin or a
progestin alone are used in these methods. The mechanism

of action of both (the hormones) estrogen and progesterone
combination and progesterone-only pills is to prevent
luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and as a result to inhibit
ovulation, they also thicken cervical mucous in such a way

that prevents sperm penetration. They also cause stromal
edema, regression of endometrial glands, and produce static
endometrial hypoplasia. These hormones are steroidal
contraceptives, can be used orally, parenterally or as devices:
intrauterine and vaginal. The oral combination pills typically
contain ethinyl estradiol and a progestin. The typical failure,
i.e., pregnancy rates are under 1 per woman years of use.
Exogenous estrogen use can cause serious side effects
rarely like thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, hepatic
adenoma, and carbohydrate intolerance. The more commonly
seen adverse effects are nausea, weight gain, acne in certain
progestin pills which can be reduced by using estrogen
containing pills which suppresses activity of sebaceous glands.
The advantage, of estrogen are relief of dysmenorrhea, short
menstrual cycle; estrogen containing pills have higher levels
of cardioprotective high density lipoproteins. A few extended
cyclic pills are being released which can cause amenorrhea
for 3 months to 1 year. However, the major disadvantages of
those pills is compliance as adolescents do not take pills every
day and may lead to increased failure rates and breakthrough
bleeding. The recommendations for missing pills are given
in box 1. The most commonly used pill in India is Mala-D
(norethisterone acetate + ethinyl estradiol), Mala-N (norgestrel

11/24/2016 12:34:33 PM

Chapter 18: Teen Pregnancy and Contraception
+ ethinyl estradiol) which is also supplied by Government
of India. Other oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are Ovral-L,
Novelon, Femilon, and Loette.
Other combination methods are transdermal patch (Fig. 2)
and vaginal contraceptive ring. The transdermal patch releases
20 μg ethinyl estradiol and 150 μg norelgestromin daily. This
method is not popular among adolescents as patch can get partial
or fully detached. The vaginal contraceptive ring (NuvaRing) is a
flexible, transparent, colorless ring which is inserted into vagina
by self and remains for 3 weeks where it releases 15 μg of ethinyl
estradiol and 120 μg of etonogestrel/day.
In situations where estrogens are contraindicated,
progestin-only pills can be used. These are called “mini pills”
and are less reliable in inhibiting ovulation, compliance is
poor among adolescents. The injectable progestin, medroxy­
progesterone acetate, is highly effective as deep intra­muscular
(IM) injection 150 μg (Depo-Provera). Bone mineral density
loss which is reversible side effect should be kept in mind. The
progestin-only drug can also be used as subcutaneous implant.
Box 1: Guidelines for missed OCPS
OCP–missed pill rules
• If the teen has missed taking OCP ask her to resume her usual pill
taking schedule as early as possible. (she may take two pills on
the same day)
• If pills are missed in week 1 (Days 1–7), emergency contraception
should be considered
• If the missed pills are in week 3 she should omit the pill free
interval
• Abstinence or condoms should be used as backup method if the
following number of pills are missed
{{ Two for twenty (if two or more 20 µg ethinyl estradiol pills are
missed)
{{ Three for thirty (if three or more 30–35 µg ethinyl estradiol pills
are missed
• Emergency contraception: if you have had unprotected sex
in the previous 7 days and you have missed two or more pills
(i.e., more than 48 hours late) in the first week of a pack, you may
need emergency contraception.

Clinical Pearl
• Abstinence is the best contraception for teens.

Emergency Contraception
Pregnancy risk with unprotected intercourse (in midcycle) is
20–30%. The risk can be reduced if emergency contraception
is used within 72 hours; these emergency contraceptive
pills are combination of ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel/
levonorgestrel. This helps by disrupting luteal phase and
hormone pattern, makes cervix unstable, and unsuitable
uterine lining for implantation. They also blunt LH surge and
impair ovulation in midcycle. The important side effects are
nausea and vomiting.

unsuitable for implantation, the levonorgestrel IUD acts by
thickening of cervical mucosa, inhibiting sperm survival and
suppresses endometrium (Fig. 3). This method of contraception
is used among teens who are highly sexually active but they
should take measures to prevent STIs (Algorithm 1).

ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY
By providing good education including sexual education to our
teens, counseling them regarding abstinence, and providing
life skills, teen pregnancies can be avoided. Still there are lots
of pregnancies being reported. As one sector of them could
be early marriages from rural population and sexual abuse.
Among Indian studies, teenage pregnancy varies from 5.1% to
as high as 21.12%.
The adolescent caregivers should always suspect preg­
nancy when there is secondary amenorrhea as most
teens may be reluctant to give history of sexual activity.
The methods to diagnose pregnancy are urine pregnancy
test, which is sensitive by 5 days of missed cycles by 98%.
Ultrasound scan detects pregnancy and can also rule out an
ectopic pregnancy.
The next step after diagnosing is addressing psycho­
social, emotional, and medical aspects. The options of
elective termination of pregnancy or raising the child by
friends/family/option of adoption can be given to family.
Complications due to teen pregnancy could be medical
or psychosocial (Algorithm 2). Most teen pregnancies do
not have major medical complications. The pregnancy
termination rate is about 33% in Indian statistics.
Miscarriages/stillbirth rate is about 15%. Teen mothers have
higher rate of anemia, pregnancy induced hypertension,
eclampsia, poor weight gain, increased STIs, increased
abuse, violence, and depression. The babies of teen mothers
have behavioral problems in preschool years, poor scholastic
performance, learning difficulties; these could be attributed
to poverty, negative parenting styles, and higher possibilities
of abuse and neglect.
There are lot of educational programs for youth in
various countries to educate teens about abstinence,
contraception, STIs; this education and life skills training

INTRODUCTION
The HEEADSSS (Home, Education and employment, Eating
and exercise, Activities and peer relationships, Drugs, Suicide
and depression, Sexuality and Safety) assessment is a screening
tool for conducting a comprehensive psychosocial history
and health risk assessment of an adolescent (Algorithm 1). It
provides an ideal platform for a preventive health check and
information about the young one’s functioning in key areas of
their life.

BUILD A RELATIONSHIP
•

Confidently welcome the adolescent
Algorithm 1
Algorithm depicts points for interviewing and
risk assessment in an adolescent child

Respond openly to adolescent’s initial reactions and
feelings
Give clear introductions: yourself, your role, what you will
be doing and why, e.g., “to get a better understanding of
different areas of your life and how these might affect your
health, I would like to ask you a few questions if it is okay
with you”
{{ Reassure the young person about confidentiality.
However, three exceptions must be made clear to the
young person and their caregivers:
1. Harm to self
2. Harm to others
3. Others harming you.
{{ Start with less sensitive areas of a young person’s life
and move towards more sensitive areas using a “third
person” approach, e.g., “Some young people of your
age are starting to experiment with drugs or alcohol (or
sex). Have any of your friends tried these? How about
yourself?”
{{ Perform a risk assessment and screen for specific risk
behaviors which occur in clusters.

Section 2: Adolescence

WRAPPING UP THE SESSION
At the end of the HEEADSSS assessment, the pediatrician
should compliment the young person on their strengths and
areas in their life where they are doing well. He should:
• Identify areas for intervention and prevention
• Identify and discuss any issues of concern psychosocial
health
• Identify the overall level of risk of the young person and
specific risk factors in their lives, as well as protective
factors and strengths
• Identify areas for intervention and follow-up
• Provide health education about particular health issues or
risk behaviors.
The HEEADSSS assessment is not simply an information
gathering exercise; listen carefully to the young person’s verbal
and nonverbal responses. Adolescents may present with minor
complaints but exploring beyond the presenting complaint
may detect underlying health concerns and risk factors, thereby
providing timely intervention and preventive education.

PRINCIPLES OF INTERVENTION
•
•

Allow time to finish, provide a brief summary, give
opportunity for questions
Discuss options and help the adolescent make choices

•

Based on the level of risk: decrease risk factors or increase
protective factors
• Possible foci: environment and social context, family,
individual.
A pediatrician must seek a collaborative approach and
facilitate access to psychological and specialist counseling
services once a problem has been identified.

Clinical Pearl
• Specific risk behaviors usually occur in clusters. Risk assessment,
therefore, must be done continuously throughout the whole
interview of the adolescent in order to identify associated
factors.

Adolescent Anemia
Vaishali R Deshmukh

Introduction
Anemia is a major public health problem in India. It has a
special significance in adolescents as it affects final height,
cognition, and reproductive health.
Most of the hereditary or congenital anemias present
before the age of adolescence (exceptions: congenital dys­
erythropoietic anemia, milder forms of hemolytic anemia).
Since nutritional anemia, especially iron deficiency anemia, is
the most commonly found anemia in adolescents in India as
well as all over the world, it will be discussed here in detail.
Anemia is not a specific entity. It is a condition, which
results from an underlying pathologic process.
Surprisingly, in a gradually developing anemia, hardly
any symptoms are apparent until hemoglobin reaches a level
of 8 g/dL or lower because, the body adjusts for anemia in the
initial stages by various adaptive mechanisms.
The normal lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs) is 110–120
days. Adult RBCs do not have a nucleus. This makes them a better
oxygen vehicle but gives them a definite lifespan. Adolescents,
beyond the age of 12 years, have hematologic ranges similar to
those of adults. At puberty, hemoglobin concentration reaches
adult level as a result of effect of androgens on erythropoiesis.

PREVALENCE
According to the World Health Organization Global Database,
the prevalence of anemia is very high in India putting it in
severe public health problem category.
According to National Family Health Survey-3, the
prevalence of anemia in Indian adolescent girls is 56–68% and
boys is 56–68% and 30%, respectively.

DEFINITION
Anemia is defined as reduction in the number of RBCs or
reduced packed cell volume (hematocrit) or low hemoglobin,
all below the lower limit for the age norm.

ch-20.indd 79

Clinical Pearl
The World Health Organization Global Database:
• Prevalence of anemia in south-east Asia: 57%
• Global prevalence in school-aged children: 25.4% (305 million)
• Overall prevalence in India: 74.3%.

India.

The functional definition of anemia is “an insufficient
RBC mass to adequately deliver oxygen to peripheral tissues”
(Table 1).

Severe Anemia
Severe anemia is defined clinically as a low hemoglobin
concentration leading to cardiac decompensation, that is, to
the point that the heart cannot maintain adequate circulation
of the blood. There is extreme pallor. If the hemoglobin or
hematocrit can be determined, cutoffs of hemoglobin below
7.0 g/dL or hematocrit below 20% should be used to define
severe anemia.

Clinical Pearl
• Anemia is caused by either reduced or ineffective production
of red blood cells (RBCs), blood loss, or increased destruction
of RBCs.

11/18/2016 5:36:46 PM

Section 2: Adolescence

Mechanism of Anemia of Chronic Diseases
In a chronic disease, anemia is caused either due to decreased
production or increased destruction of RBCs. The mechanism is
as follows:
• Reduced erythropoietin
• Moderate decrease in RBC lifespan
• Increased RBC destruction by the hyperactive reticulo­
endothelial system
• Relative failure of bone marrow response
• Defective release of iron from tissues into plasma
• Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor causing suppressed
erythroid response.

Etiology of Anemia (Algorithm 1)
Nutritional Anemia
By definition, it is the anemia caused by dietary deficiency
of one or more nutrients required for hemoglobin synthesis.
The most common deficiency is that of iron followed by folate
and vitamin B12. This deficiency is usually compounded by
intestinal parasites (helminthiasis) and malaria.
Iron deficiency anemia typically shows three phases with
increasing severity:
1. Prelatent phase of iron deficiency: reduced serum ferritin,
reduced iron stores without reduction in serum iron
2. Latent phase: iron stores are exhausted but hemoglobin
levels are normal. Some symptoms such as fatigue, malaise
but no anemia. Increase in total iron binding capacity,
reduction in transferrin saturation
3. Iron deficiency anemia: pallor, pica, low hemoglobin,
presence of microcytes.

Other Causes of Anemia in Adolescents
Other causes of anemia in adolescents are as follows:
• Thalassemia
• Sickle-cell anemia
• Pernicious anemia
• Hemorrhagic causes
• Chronic disease
• Bone marrow infiltration.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF ANEMIA IN
ADOLESCENTS
Various unique factors contribute to the cause and effect of
anemia in adolescence.

Clinical Pearl
• The most common anemia in adolescents all over the world is
iron deficiency anemia.

Gender difference between normal ranges of hematocrit
starts becoming apparent at adolescence. The sudden growth
spurt (the third and the last spurt after intrauterine life and
gestation) leads to relative deficiency of nutrients and occult
deficiencies become apparent. Hormones like testosterone,
which affect erythropoiesis, peak during adolescence.
• In adolescent boys, the rapidly increasing muscle mass
demands high amount of iron. In addition, the blood
volume increases in short span
• Menstrual losses contribute to iron deficiency in adolescent
girls
• In girls, the beginning of menstruation, i.e., menarche, leads
to significant loss of blood on a regular basis. The menstrual
flow may be heavier in the initial period of menarche. Add
to this the increased demand for iron due to rapid growth
and the result is significant anemia in adolescent girls.
Teenage pregnancy makes the physiological anemia of
pregnancy much more severe
• Intergenerational effect of anemia: low maternal
hemoglobin and weight is a major cause of intrauterine
growth restriction and high maternal mortality
• Changes in thinking patterns and lifestyle lead to food fads,
consumption of junk food, and irregular eating habits
The changing lifestyle and the peculiar temperament of
adolescents are responsible for this. They eat a lot of junk
food due to irregular timings and peer pressure. The sense
of newly acquired freedom and the need to stay away from
home necessitates them to eat outside food
• Socioeconomic status of the family, traditional eating
habits of the region, the fear of gaining weight, and irregular

eating habits are of great importance in development of
adolescent anemia
Adolescents have poor compliance to treatment
“I do not care” attitude causes difficulty in convincing them
of consequences
Occasional or no visits to doctors prevent early detection.

Clinical Effects of Anemia
•

•

•

•

•
•

In a gradually developing anemia, patient may remain
asymptomatic until hemoglobin reaches a level of 8 g/dL
or lower. The symptoms depend upon the magnitude and
the rate of reduction in oxygen carrying capacity of blood
and the capacity of the pulmonary and the cardiovascular
system to compensate for anemia. The symptomatology
also reflects the symptoms of the underlying disease
Normally, the body adjusts for anemia in the initial stages
by various adaptive mechanisms. The cardiac output
increases to increase the oxygen delivery to the tissues.
The production of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the RBCs
increases leading to reduced affinity of hemoglobin to
oxygen. This causes shift of oxygen dissociation curve to
the left causing release of oxygen to tissues faster. This is
also seen at high altitudes. Production of erythropoietin
increases too, leading to stimulation of bone marrow and
increased RBC output
A striking feature of iron deficiency anemia is pica. This
desire to consume unusual things is very peculiar to iron
deficiency anemia, the reason is not clear, especially seen
is pagophagia, i.e., urge to eat unusual amounts of ice
Skin and mucosa: the hair texture worsens leading to lack
of luster, premature graying, and thinning of hair. This
effect can be used to counsel the adolescents as this may
appeal to them
Neuromuscular symptoms: headache, vertigo, tinnitus,
faintness, lack of concentration, drowsiness, restlessness,
muscular weakness; in pernicious anemia, paresthesias
Behavioral and cognitive problems: iron deficiency
adversely affects behavior by impairing cognitive functions,

producing noncognitive disturbances, and limiting activity
and work capacity
Iron supplementation among iron deficient anemic
children benefits learning processes as measured by the school
achievement test scores:
• Poor physical growth
• High maternal mortality
• Gastrointestinal: symptoms of underlying disorder
(duodenal ulcer, cancer, hiatus hernia).

INVESTIGATIONS (ALGORITHM 2)
•

•
•
•
•
•

Hemogram with peripheral blood smear (PBS): to
determine the severity of anemia, affection of other cell
lines, RBC morphology, hematocrit level, and presence of
parasites such as malaria
Reticulocyte count: to assess bone marrow response
Stool for parasites and occult blood
Hemoglobin electrophoresis
Serum bilirubin and serum iron studies
Investigations to rule out underlying diseases.

MANAGEMENT
Treatment Program (Algorithm 3)
International Nutritional Anemia Consultative Group has
recommended the following treatment program:
• Mild anemia: 60 mg of elemental iron daily for 3 months
after which hemoglobin estimation is done
• Moderate anemia: it is investigated for complete blood
count, PBS, malarial parasites, and stool for occult blood
and treated in the same way as mild anemia
• Severe anemia: investigate and treat with 120 mg iron +
400 µg folic acid daily for 3 months.

Indications for Blood Transfusion
•

All children with hemoglobin less than or equal to 4 g/dL

If packed cells are available, give 10 mL/kg over
3–4 hours preferably. If not, give whole blood 20 mL/kg
over 3–4 hours with close monitoring and diuretics.

Prevention (Fig. 1)
Due to its prevalence across all age groups all over the world,
prevention plays a major role in the management of iron
deficiency anemia
• Increased awareness about the magnitude of anemia and
its far-reaching consequences among the masses will go a
long way to reduce its incidence
• School and college based awareness programs to reduce
consumption of junk food and to encourage healthy
dietary habits
• Food based interventions: fortification of commonly
consumed food, such as salt, milk, or atta with iron
• Screening for anemia in adolescents and other high risk
groups to tap cases of anemia in presymptomatic stage
• Regular supplementation of iron-folic acid tablets to
adolescents and pregnant women.
National Iron plus Initiative: this is a proposed lifecycle ironfolic acid supple­mentation program by Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare, where age specific recommendations are

made for prophylactic iron and folic acid supplementation to
children, adolescents, and pregnant women.
All adolescent boys as well as girls (10–19 years) are given
weekly tablets containing 100 mg elemental iron and 500 μg of
folic acid along with biannual deworming:
• Diet: increased consumption of food rich in iron, such as
animal proteins, green leafy vegetables, jaggery, etc. Using
iron pots for cooking
• Biannual deworming of all school-going children with
albendazole
• Malaria control
• Treatment of underlying condition
• Reproductive and obstetric interventions: preventing
adolescent pregnancies, reducing the total number of
pregnancies and increasing the time between pregnancies
will contribute to the control of iron deficiency anemia in
women. Pregnancy creates a large demand for iron, which
is needed to develop the fetus and placenta and to expand
a woman’s blood volume. Additional iron is lost with blood
lost at delivery. When the iron demands of pregnancy are
combined with the iron demands of adolescent growth, girls
enter adulthood at great risk of iron deficiency.

CONCLUSION
Anemia is a major public health problem in India. In adolescent
age group, iron deficiency anemia is the most common
anemia. It is of particular significance due to its major effects
on growth, development, productivity, maternal mortality, and
intergenerational effects. Regular screening, prophylaxis, early
detection and treatment, food fortification, and public awareness
programs are needed to control iron deficiency anemia.

Academics and Career Choices in Adolescents:
Approach in the Pediatric Office Setting
Ira E Almeida

INTRODUCTION
For parents whose health concerns about their wards have been
addressed by the pediatrician for so many years, there is no leap
of faith in expecting that the same doctor must have something
in a bottle or book that addresses their biggest anxiety during
their child’s adolescence academic performance. Most
children enter high school and adolescence at the same time
in India—it becomes a time fraught with stress by definition
alone. In most government schools, high school is the first time
children can fail a grade and have to repeat it—in such schools,
government policy mandates that children get promoted to the
next grade regardless of competence in taught skills right up to
grade VII. It is not surprising that pediatric practices face large
numbers of adolescents presenting with academic difficulties.
A pediatric practice must stretch its role to point parents and
their adolescent children presenting with such difficulties
in the correct direction, whether with a direct solution or by
referring the child to appropriate assessors.
A seemingly innocuous statement made by a mother
“my child does not study well; give him a tonic”, can cause a
great deal of anxiety in the pediatrician. However, this is not
as simple as it sounds. Besides, doctors often feel helpless
when the parents ask them to advise career choices for their
wards (often they also hope that they will inspire their kids to
become doctors).
In the conventional system of education in India, we have
those who are academic and those who are not. For those who
are academic achievers, the paths that most parents wish for
their children are those that will take them to professional
courses like medicine and engineering and if not successful,
allied fields like physiotherapy, audiology, diplomas in
technical courses, etc. are acceptable. For the creative types
who fall off this path, many interesting fields like photography,
design, advertising, media, communication, and event
management are now available.
If the child has made up his mind as to what he/she wants
to do, encouraging them to shadow a professional in the field

for a day or more can be helpful. If the child is undecided,
aptitude testing and workshops on career options are useful.
An approach to help the pediatrician in office practice to
guide and refer appropriately with regard to academics and
career choices is represented in algorithm 1.

School and Performance
The greater difficulty is when the child presents with under­
achievement. For the pediatrician, one needs to evaluate study
skills, examine parental expectations, and check perfor­mance
reports. Medical problems like hypothyroidism, iron, iodine, or
vitamin deficiencies must be looked into. Checking for specific
activity disorder,
learning disability, attention deficit hyper­
emotional problems, physical problems, and substance abuse
becomes imperative. Specific learning disability usually
presents with the child doing well orally, but doing dis­
proportionally badly in written work. Emotional problems
which can affect self-esteem, concentration, and application
should be considered. Below normal intelligence could be due
to perinatal causes like TORCH [toxoplasmosis, other (syphilis,
varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19), rubella, cyto­megalovirus, and
herpes] infections, prematurity, meningo­encephalitis, or an
underlying chromosomal disorder like Klinefelter’s syndrome,
Fragile X, Turner’s syndrome, etc.

Clinical Pearl
• Anemia in adolescent girls and iodine deficiency in hilly areas
are often missed and are easily correctable causes of poor
school performance.

Physical problems like visual disability (uncorrected
refractive errors, squint, or more serious conditions like
chorio­retinitis, retinal detachment, etc.), hearing disability,
(congenital or acquired) need a thorough evaluation. Children
with Down syndrome, mild cerebral palsy, hemiplegic
syndromes may also have writing difficulties and would

benefit from technological alternatives like tablets. Substance
abuse should be looked into if there are any tell-tale signs like
red eyes, inappropriate use of sunglasses, long sleeves, and
unexplained need for pocket money or parental suspicion.
An excessive amount of screen time can affect academic
performance, especially online addiction to pornography.

College and Careers
Career counseling tests may not be always accurate though they
may help to clear the confusion in the child’s mind and give the
parents the satisfaction that they are doing something. Asking
the child how they see themselves 10 years from now and

working backwards may help. More often the child knows what
they do not want to do, before they know what they want to.
Taking into consideration their interests, personality,
life goals, and values besides their academic strengths and
aptitude makes it easier to zero in on a career. Most career
guidance centers are able to provide information regarding
eligibility and entrance procedures for career options both in
India and abroad.

• Children with borderline mental retardation should be put in
skill programs/apprenticeships as early as possible, i.e., after
middle school.

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and
Menstrual Problems in Adolescents
Roli M Srivastava

POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME
The condition “polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)” was
first described in 1935 by Dr Stein and Dr Leventhal; hence
its original name Stein-Leventhal syndrome is characterized
by an imbalance of hormones in women which can affect
menstrual periods and ovulation. Women are often very
embarrassed by some of the symptoms associated with this
condition, such as excessive hair growth, acne, obesity, and
the development of small cysts on the ovaries. Because of these
distressing symptoms, women may also experience feelings
of depression and anxiety. It is one of the most common
female endocrine disorders affecting approximately 5–10% of
women of reproductive age and is one of the leading causes
of infertility. It is a very common problem amongst young
women and teenage girls, sometimes even affecting girls as
young as 11 years of age. If not treated early, serious health
complications, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
can develop and so, the management of the PCOS patient
often will vary over time as the patient enters different stages of
life with different goals. In contrast, because of the long-term
health implications of insulin resistance (IR), the importance
of lifestyle modification towards weight management and
maintaining adequate physical activity should be the one
constant in the management of these patients.

DIAGNOSIS is BY CLINICAL EXAMination,
ULTRASOUND, and LABORATORY
Polycystic ovarian syndrome is most simply clinically defined
as the presence of:
• Hyperandrogenism (clinically and/or biochemically)
• Chronic anovulation in the absence of specific adrenal
and/or pituitary disease.

ch-22.indd 87

•
•

•

Hirsutism: the growth of coarse hair on a woman in a male
pattern (upper lip, chin, chest, upper abdomen, back, etc.)
Acne: pubertal acne in general is twice as prevalent in
adolescent males versus females and males are more likely
to have severe disease. Thus, an adolescent female with
moderate-to-severe acne should be investigated for PCOS
Virilization: clitoromegaly, deepening voice, increased
musculature, or rapidly progressive hirsutism or alopecia),
however, is not a feature of PCOS, but instead of more
severe hyperandrogenism.

Chronic Anovulation
It may result in:
• Oligomenorrhea
• Amenorrhea
• Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
• Infertility.
However, around 20% of patients with PCOS may have
normal menstrual cycles. Often, menstrual abnormalities
are long-standing, even since menarche although primary
amenorrhea very rare (Box 1).

POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN
SYNDROME DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
Polycystic ovarian syndrome includes a wide spectrum of
clinical symptoms and signs. Three different diagnostic
classifications had been proposed to define this disease
till November 2015. The first one was published in 1990,
and is known as the “National Institute of Health criteria”.
Later, in 2003, an expert panel met in Rotterdam and added

• Hirsutism

Hyperandrogenism may present clinically as hirsutism, acne,

to the previous criteria the presence of polycystic ovarian
morphology detected by transvaginal ultrasonography (Fig. 1).
Then, the Androgen Excess Society, published in 2006, gave
the new diagnostic criteria being applied till late and finally
latest in November 2015, the American Association of Clinical
Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and
Androgen Excess Society released new guidelines in the
evaluation and treatment of PCOS (Table 1).
As PCOS is an umbrella of various signs and symptoms,
certain diseases with nearly same presenting features,
especially irregular cycles and androgenic features, have to be
ruled out to reach the diagnosis (Algorithm 1).

DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL
DIAGNOSIS (TABLE 2)

88

ch-22.indd 88

Not all women with PCOS have polycystic ovaries, nor do
all women with ovarian cysts have PCOS; although a pelvic
ultrasound is a major diagnostic tool, it is not the only one.
The diagnosis is straightforward using the Rotterdam criteria,
even when the syndrome is associated with a wide range of

Ovaries may show sonographic features of polycystic ovaries
(Fig. 2), bilateral enlarged ovaries with multiple small follicles:
50%
• Increased ovarian size (>10 cc)
• 12 or more follicles measuring 2–9 mm
• Follicles of similar size
• Peripheral location of follicles: gives a string of pearl
appearance
• Hyperechoic central stroma.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF POLYCYSTIC
OVARIAN SYNDROME
Polycystic ovaries develop, when the ovaries are stimulated
to produce androgens, either through excess of luteinizing

Clinical Pearl
• Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) should be considered
and appropriate assessment should be undertaken before
commencement of the oral contraceptive pills in adolescents
with irregular periods, i.e., irregular cycles (≥35 days or <21 days),
2 years following menarche. Other causes of irregular cycles,
such as thyroid dysfunction or hyperprolactinemia, need to be
considered and excluded prior to the diagnosis of PCOS.

hormone (LH) or through hyperinsulinemia in women whose
ovaries are sensitive to this stimulus. Multiple ovarian cysts are
seen in ultrasound. These “cysts” are actually immature follicles
whose development has arrested at an early-antral stage due
to the disturbed ovarian function. Polycystic ovarian syndrome
is characterized by a complex set of symptoms, and research
to date suggests that IR could be a leading cause. Polycystic
ovarian syndrome may also have a genetic predisposition.
A majority of patients with PCOS have IR and/or are obese.
Their elevated insulin levels contribute to the abnormalities
seen in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis that lead
to PCOS. Adipose tissue possesses aromatase that converts
androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. The
excess of adipose tissue in obese patients creates the paradox
of having both excess androgens (which are responsible for

ch-22.indd 89

hirsutism and virilization) and estrogens [which inhibits
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) via negative feedback].
Also, hyperinsulinemia increases gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency, LH over FSH dominance,
increased ovarian androgen production, decreased follicular
maturation and decreased sex hormone-binding globulin
(SHBG) binding; all these steps lead to the development
of PCOS. Insulin resistance is a common finding among
patients of normal weight as well as those overweight patients
(Algorithm 2).

effects
• Restore menstrual regularity
• Manage the cosmetic symptoms and signs
• Restore fertility if desired
• Long-term health: chronic disease prevention
• Diabetes prevention
• Cardiovascular disease risk reduction
• Cancer prevention
The medical management of PCOS can be broken into:
• Chronic management
• Acute management (Algorithm 3).

HIRSUTISM
The decision to treat should be based on the patient’s perception
of the excess terminal hair growth. It can be managed in two
ways (Algorithm 5):
• Treatment of hirsutism:
{{ Cosmetic: shaving, waxing, electrolysis, etc.
• Medical management of hirsutism:
{{ Decreasing the amount

Polycystic ovarian syndrome accounts for 75% of anovulatory
infertility. Additionally, when pregnancies do occur, the first
trimester miscarriage rate is as high as 30–50% (Table 4).

Metformin

• Obese women do not respond to
low doses at the rate of 50 mg dose
• The degree of obesity correlates
with the dose of clomiphene
needed to induce ovulation
• The higher doses may cause side
effects and can increase the rate
of multiple gestations, given in
combination with metformin

• Lifestyle modification needs to be
stressed
• 3–6 month trial of aggressive lifestyle
modification may be a prudent first
step before considering an insulin
sensitizer

• Start at 500 mg twice a day and increased to thrice
a day if ovulation did not occur by 6 weeks, and add
clomiphene 6 weeks later
• Use improves the outcome of other infertility therapies
• Improves fertilization and pregnancy rates
• In the setting of infertility, metformin therapy should
likely be continued for as long as fertility efforts are
ongoing, even if it “fails” initially
• Reduces risk of early pregnancy loss; no birth defects
occurred

includes metformin and/or combination therapy with oral
contraceptive agents and antiandrogen agents.
It is hoped that early and proper diagnosis, will allow
more women to be managed properly for their presenting

educated and managed for the continuing health risk of IR
throughout their lives.

Approach to a Case of
Sexual Abuse in Children/Adolescent
Sushma P Desai

WHAT IS CHILD/
ADOLESCENT SEXUAL ABUSE
Definition of adolescent sexual abuse as provided by many
working in the field of child abuse, it is “any sexual behavior
directed at the dependent developmentally immature child
and adolescent that they do not comprehend fully, to which
they are unable to give informed consent. It involves the
exposure of a child to sexual contact, activity, or behavior
and may include invitation to sexual touching, intercourse,
or other forms of exploitation such as juvenile prostitution or
pornography”.

Clinical Pearl
• Under the law, child sexual abuse is an umbrella term
describing criminal and civil offenses in which adult engages in
sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose
of sexual gratification. It can never be considered normal or
socially acceptable behavior.

The World Health Organization defines an adolescent as
being between 10 and 19 years.

SEXUAL ABUSE BEHAVIOR DEFINITION

a child or adolescent touch the adult’s genitalia
An adult involving a child or adolescent in pornography,
either by exposing a child or adolescent to create
pornographic material
An adult having oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse with a
child or adolescent
Any verbal or other sexual suggestion made to a child or
adolescent by an adult

•

An adult persuading a child or adolescent to engage in
sexual activity.
If an older adolescent manifest such a behavior to a child it
will also constitute child sexual abuse.

Clinical Pearl
• The United Nations Children’s Fund: “Child marriage represents
the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of
girls”.

AGE OF CONSENSUAL SEX
Age of consensual sex in India is 16 year of age. Age of simple
majority is 18 years and legal age of consent for marriage is 21
years in boy and 18 years in girls.

PEDOPHILE
Usually, it has an unidentifiable sexual preference with regard
to prepubertal children and will frequent locations that attract
children.

Incest (Intrafamilial Child Abuse/Child
Incestuous Abuse)
Traditionally “incest” is defined as sexual relations between
people classed as being too closely related to marry each other.

Clinical Pearl
• Incest between a child/adolescent and a related adult has
been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual
abuse with a huge capacity for the damage to a child. It leads
to serious type of long-term psychological trauma, especially
in case of parental incest.

Chapter 23: Approach to a Case of Sexual Abuse in Children/Adolescent
Most often reported form of incest is father-daughter and
stepfather-daughter incest, mother/stepmother-daughter form
contributes to a small portion of the remaining incest. Sibling
incest may also be as common as or more common than other
types of incest. Prevalence of parental incest is difficult to assess
due to secrecy and privacy. Statistics show that about 30% of
all perpetrators are related to the sexual victim, 60% are family
acquaintances, and 10% are strangers.

Commercial Sexual
Exploitation of Children
Commercial sexual exploitation of children is defined as
“Sexual abuse by an adult accompanied by remuneration
in cash or in kind to the child or to the third person(s).
Commercial sexual exploitation of children usually take
the form of child prostitution or child pornography and is
often facilitated by child sex tourism (also internet child
pornography)”. It is particularly a problem of developing
countries of Asia.

Types
Child sexual abuse includes a variety of sexual offenses,
including:
• Sexual assault: an adult uses a minor for the purpose of
sexual gratification, e.g., rape (including sodomy) and
sexual penetration with an object
• Sexual exploitation: offenses in which an adult victimizes
a minor for advancement, sexual gratification, or profit,
e.g., prostituting a child and creating or trafficking in child
pornography
• Sexual grooming: it defines a social conduct of a potential
child sex offender who seeks to make a minor more
accepting of their advances, e.g., in an online chat room.

VULNERABLE SITUATIONS (RISK FACTORS)
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

ch-23.indd 95

Children and adolescents of single parent: due to lack of
adequate supervision
Children and adolescents with low self-esteem: due
to failure in academic life. If parents persistently keep
comparing them with the achievers; this results in low selfesteem and as rebellion they may involve in sexual activity
considering it as an achievement
Attraction to city life: children and adolescents get induced
by middlemen and easy access to money/comforts of life
Lack of education: children and adolescents due to lack of
education lack of being well-informed may get induced to
sexual activities by strangers easily
Children and adolescence education on sex and sexual
parts will help them take care of their private parts and
sexual life
Poverty: high risk of getting sexually abused because of
poor socioeconomic conditions
Parental factors: loss of job and substance abuse like
alcoholism. Drug addiction

•
•
•

Mentally and physically: challenged/retarded children and
adolescents
Unloved, uncared children, and adolescent
Violence in community.

PROFILE OF THE ADULT SEX OFFENDER
•

•
•
•
•

Children and adolescents living in parents homes are more
likely to be abused by adults from within the family or
known friend circle. In 80% of the cases, the perpetrator is
either related or known to the victim
Children on streets or observation homes are more likely to
be abused by strangers
The offender has a special ability to identify vulnerable
children, to use that vulnerability to sexually abuse the child
The systematically desensitize children to touch
They use adult authority to isolate the victim from others
and enforce their victim’s silence including threats, force,
bribery, acts of cruelty.

TYPES OF OFFENDERS
There are two groups:
• Situational: does not prefer children, but offend under
certain circumstances. They can be:
{{ Regressed: typically has a relationship with the adults,
but a stressor causes them to seek children as a
substitute
{{ Morally indiscriminate: all-round sexual deviant, who
may commit other sexual offenses unrelated to children
{{ Naïve/inadequate: often mentally disabled in some
way, finds children less threatening
• Preferential: has true sexual interest in children
{{ Mysoped: sadistic and violent, target strangers more
often than acquaintances
{{ Fixated: little or no activity with own age, described as
“overgrown child”.

STATISTICS OF CHILD SEXUAL
ABUSE IN INDIA
Global prevalence: study in 2009 shows (65 studies from 22
countries) 19.7% of female children and 7.9% male, highest in
Africa 34.4%, lowest in Europe 9.2%, Asia 23.9%.
India: the Ministry of Women and Child Development
published the Study on Child Abuse: India 2007. Its main
findings included 53.22% of children reported having faced
sexual abuse. About 52.9% were boys and 47.06% girls.
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, and Delhi reported highest
incidence. Children on streets, at work, and in institutional
care reported higher incidence. The study also reported 50%
of the abusers are known to the child or are in a position of
trust and responsibility. Most children had not reported the
matter to anyone.

Section 2: Adolescence

Clinical Pearls
• About 40% of girls and 25% of boys are sexually abused before
they reach 16 years of age.
• One-tenth children is being sexually abused at any given point
of time.

EFFECTS

Clinical Pearl

Psychological Effects

• Children who receive supportive responses after disclosure
have less traumatic symptoms and are abused for a shorter
period of time.

Clinical Pearl
• About 51–79% of sexually abused children exhibit psycho­
logical symptoms.

The child sexual abuse can lead to both long- and short-term
harm, including psychopathology in later life. The common
effects are anxiety, depression, eating disorders, poor self
esteem, somatization, sleep disturbances, dissociative disorder,
and posttraumatic stress disorder. Children may manifest
regressive disorders like thumb sucking and bed wetting.

Clinical Pearl

•

History
•

The victim may withdraw from school and normal social
activities and exhibit learning and behavioral problem, cruelty
to animals, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct
disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder.
Adolescent victims show risky sexual behavior. Self-inflicted
harm and teenage pregnancy is one of the important effects.
Increased rates of crime in sexually abused teen are observed.

Physical Effects

•
•

Injury: depending on age and the size of the child and the
degree of force used. Internal laceration, bleeding, and
damage to internal organs and even death
Infection: sexually transmitted infections, human immuno­
deficiency virus/acquired immuno­deficiency syndrome
Neurological damage: traumatic stress, including stress
caused by sexual abuse, causes notable changes in brain
functioning and development. Increased likelihood of
“ictal temporal lobe epilepsy-like symptoms”. Short-term
memory impairment and lowering of the score of math
scholastic aptitude test.

DIAGNOSIS/DISCLOSURE
•

96

ch-23.indd 96

•

Victims are often unable to speak due to different reasons
such as threat, fear, shame, guilt
Therefore, indirect nonverbal clues, behavioral distur­
bances, psychosomatic, psychiatric, and seldom physical

American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
provides guidelines for what to say to the victim and what
to do following the disclosure.

EXAMINATION OF
A CASE OF SEXUAL ABUSE

• The strongest indicator of sexual abuse is inappropriate sexual
knowledge and interest.

•

symptoms are often the only way to recognize sexual
abuse
There is no specific symptom/syndrome
Most important element of the diagnosis is the disclosure,
which depends on our ability to speak with children
Children need support and stress-reducing resources after
disclosure of sexual abuse. Negative social reactions to the
disclosure have been found to be harmful to the survivor’s
well-being.

•

Look for risk factors of victimization/vulnerability for
sexual abuse in adolescents like:
{{ Female sex
{{ Going alone in lonely places at odd times
{{ Going to a friend’s house for exchanging notes
{{ Parties (especially night parties)
{{ Dating
{{ Crowded places (e.g., buses, trains, fair, etc.)
{{ “Immoral” neighborhood
{{ Families with a person of personality disorder (sex
maniac)
{{ Single parent/broken homes
{{ Both parents working and child alone at home
{{ Children on foster care, i.e., parents or elders are out
and some relative/friend is staying at home
{{ Drinking/watching pornography/movie with friends
{{ Heart breaks, failure, and other situations needing
emotional support
{{ History of past abuse
How to identify sex abuse/flag signs for the adolescent
specialist:
{{ Fear of being bathed
{{ Having a great deal of knowledge about sex at a very
young age or sexual behavior that seems beyond his or
her age
{{ Feeling depressed
{{ Anxiety, low-self esteem
{{ Sudden avoidance to visit a particular place or a
particular person, decreased desire of interaction with
peers
{{ Poor interest in academics
{{ Fondling with one’s genitalia too often
{{ Drug or alcohol abuse.

Physical Examination
•

Points to remember:
Ensure patient privacy
{{ Prepare the child by explaining the examination and
showing equipment; this has been shown to diminish
fears and anxiety
{{ Ask whom he/she would like in the room for support
during the examination
The examination should include:
{{ Mental maturity—by asking questions like age, time,
etc.
{{ Physical maturity—with the help of growth parameters
{{ Nutrition status
{{ Look—vacant/starry/slating/fearful
{{ Mental status—confused/clear/apprehensive
{{ Clothing—any evidence struggle/trace evidence like
hair and stains of forensic importance
{{ Oral hygiene and personal hygiene
{{ Physical indicator of sexual assault and injuries
Indicators of child sexual abuse:
{{ Sure indicators:
–– Venereal diseases
–– Pregnancy
–– Presence of semen
–– Gonococcal infection of pharynx, urethra, rectum,
vagina
{{ Probable indicators:
–– Genital herpes
–– Trichomonas
–– Recurrent urinary tract infection
–– Horizontal hymen opening in relation to age.
{{ Near indicators:
–– Abdominal pains
–– Leaking vagina or anus
–– Difficult walking
–– Sudden withdrawal from normal activities
–– Sudden change in appetite
–– Unusual sexual knowledge
–– Mood variation without any obvious reasons
–– Depression or depersonalization
–– Irritation unprovoked or easily induced
–– Suicide attempts or threats
–– Lack of attachment to parents
–– Torn clothing and/or stained with blood or semen
Detail examination of the genitalia:
{{ Genital injuries in adolescents:
–– Scratches over the thigh, genitalia, or body
–– Bruising of the vulva
–– Swelling in the genital area
–– Minor tears in the hymen
–– Minor lacerations
–– Bleeding
–– Laceration of large size in case of age incompatibility

Age Determination
It has a great medicolegal importance as the justice and
punishment to the abuser is directly related to the age of the
victim. The age determination of an adolescent can be done
from a comprehensive examination of the following four
aspects:
1. General physical features
2. Secondary sexual character: Tanner’s staging
3. Appearance of teeth: orthopantomogram is helpful
4. Ossification of bones.

Collection of Forensic Samples
The following samples are required to be collected in sexual
abuse cases:
• Blood (blood grouping, testing drug intoxication)
• Urine (to test for suspected pregnancy, drug testing)
• Seminal stain (blood grouping)
• Nail scraping (from under the nails, to look for epithelium
of the assailant)
• Hair (to look for seminal stain, foreign hair)
• Vaginal swabs (vulva, low vaginal, high vaginal): it is
stressed here that it should be made a routine
• Microscopic examination of vaginal slides (motile and
immotile sperm).

TREATMENT
The initial approach depends upon following factors:
• Age at the time of presentation
• Circumstances of presentation for treatment
• Comorbid conditions.
The goal of management is:
• To treat current issues
• To prevent future abuse/untoward incidences.
There are three modalities of therapy:
1. Family therapy
2. Group therapy
3. Individual therapy.
Treatment of young children requires strong parental
involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents
tend to be more independent, they respond well to individual
or group therapy. The modalities also shift during the course of
therapy, e.g., group therapy is rarely used in initial stages as the
subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT

FOLLOW-UP AND REHABILITATION

Prophylaxis of Sexually Transmitted Diseases

•

Incidence of sexually transmitted diseases from sexual assault
without prophylaxis is:
• Condyloma: 1 in 4
• Chlamydia: 1 in 10
• Gonorrhea: 1 in 30
• Human immunodeficiency virus: 1 in 1,000
• Syphilis: 1 in 1,000
• Hepatitis B/herpes simplex virus: uncertain.

•

Gonorrhea and Chlamydia
•

•

•

Nonpregnant victims:
{{ Doxycycline 300 mg orally, stat, followed by 100 mg
twice a day for 3 days (patient >8 years old)
Alternative:
{{ Floxacin 400 mg twice a day for 7 days (patient >16 years
old)
{{ Azithromycin 2 g orally, single dose
Pregnancy and adolescent victims: erythromycin 1.5 g
orally stat, followed by 500 mg four times a day.

Syphilis
Benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units (adults), in children
not usually given because of a low incidence of risk of syphilis,
instead a follow-up rapid plasma reagent test is done at
6–12 weeks. If seroconversion has occurred therapy is given at
that time.

Human Papillomavirus
Not known prophylactic regimen. Human papillomavirus
vaccine is recommended for all adolescent girls and quadri­
valent vaccine for adolescent boys above age of 9 years.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus
The risk of transmission is very less, risk-benefit ratio should be
weighed before giving the drugs.
• Triple-drug therapy including zidovudine, lamivudine
(3TC) and famotidine.

Herpes Simplex Virus
•

Acyclovir 40 mg/kg.

Trichomonas
•

Metronidazole 2 g orally (single dose).

Pregnancy Prophylaxis
Incidence of pregnancy in rape/sexual assault is 1 per 100.
• Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg 2 tablets stat or ethinyl estradiol
0.05 mg 2 tablet stat, followed by 2 tablet after 12 hours.

•

Follow-up care must be given to assess the late compli­
cations, especially the psychosocial problems
Parental support is very important for the rehabilitation.
Adolescents can be taken care of at home environment in
a better way
If parents cannot support their adolescent children,
especially in rural areas, supportive social and legal
networks should be developed for them to prevent suicidal
attempts or fall into flesh trade.

PREVENTION
•
•

Adults (parents, families, community, and teachers)
must help children through nonthreatening and ageappropriate means to participate in their own protection
Personal safety curriculum is designed to:
{{ Protect children/adolescents from abuse, specifically
sexual abuse
{{ Empower children/adolescent to take part in their own
protection by giving them age appropriate information,
skills, and self-esteem
{{ Teach children/adolescent that their body belongs
only to them and nobody has the right to touch them
in a way they do not like or understand, give them
knowledge of sexual organs and function
{{ Children not to keep secret
{{ To be bold to make friends—but when it comes to sex
learn to say no
{{ Teach children/adolescent that only the offender is to
blame for any inappropriate sexual touch
{{ Teach assertiveness skills, helping children to stand up
for their own right without violating the right of others
{{ Build the support system of each child including the
family, school, community, and friends.

HOW TO HELP THE SURVIVOR
When a survivor tells us that she/he has been sexually abused,
she/he is entrusting you with a part of the life that is painful,
frightening, and vulnerable.
The following guidelines can help us honor that trust and
assist their healing:
• Believe the survivor
• Be clear that abuse is never a child or young adolescent’s fault
• Do not sympathize with the abuser
• Express your compassion
• Validate the survivor’s feeling and join with the survivor in
validating the damage
• Encourage the survivor to get support
• Seek expert’s help if the survivor is suicidal
• Respect the time and space taken to heal
• Resist seeing the survivor as a victim.

SEXUAL ABUSE AND EXISTING LEGAL SYSTEM
•
•
•

It is necessary to give recognition to child abuse as an
offence against innocence and, therefore, the law against
child rape needs to be more stringent
Since sexual abuse of minors has its own characteristics, it
needs to be addressed separately from the offence of sexual
assault on an adult person
Ironically, existing rape/sexual abuse laws make no
distinction between rape of a minor and that of an adult.

Clinical Pearl
• The “Protection of Children Against Sexual Offense Bill 2011”
was passed in the Indian Parliament on May 22, 2012 which
came into force from November 14, 2012.

International Law
Child sexual abuse is outlawed nearly everywhere in the world,
generally with severe criminal penalties including in some
jurisdiction, life imprisonment, or capital punishment. An
adult’s sexual intercourse with a child below the age of legal
consent is defined as statutory rape, based on the principle
that a child is not capable of consent and that any apparent
consent by a child is not considered to be legal consent. The
United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
is an international treaty that legally obliges states to protect
children’s rights in November 2008, 193 countries are bound by
the CRC, including every member of United Nations except the
United States and Somalia (Algorithm 1).

Key points

))
Sexual abuse is rampant and universal as children and adolescents are vulnerable and most often not in a position to voice their protest
against the heinous offense against their body/their complains are not taken seriously and many times silenced

))
About 40% of girls and 25% of boys suffer from sexual abuse before they reach 16 years of age. Majority of them are not surfaced
))
Contrary to the common belief, majority of the offenders are known to the victim
))
Child sexual abuse is one of the most fundamental violations of children’s human rights which lead to tremendous psychological trauma
having many long-term and short-term effects on their overall development adversely affecting them throughout their life

))
As the survivors are often not able to reveal, high index of suspicion based on nonverbal clues, psychosomatic symptoms and seldom
physical signs are helpful to come to the diagnosis

))
Important aspects of management are helping the survivor in disclosure with the help of counseling and strong psychosocial support.
Pharmacological therapy is aimed at prevention of pregnancy and prophylaxis against sexually transmitted infection

))
There is a great need to find ways to prevent child/adolescent sexual abuse and to ensure the safety from victimization of any form
))
Self-defense training for every girl has an important role in prevention of victimization. Schools have the potential to teach protective
behaviors effectively, including teaching the parents

))
There is a need for incorporation of child sexual abuse in Indian Penal Code, including incest, sexual abuse of boys, and nonpenetrative
sexual abuse.

Adolescent Depression/
Suicidal Tendency and Its Management
Paula Goel

Introduction
Every year about 2 million adolescents (1 in every 12) suffer
an episode of depression; 1 in 5 adolescents experience
depression before they reach adulthood. Depression affects
3.5% of children at any given time, impeding healthy psycho­
social development. Diminished self-worth, academic
struggles, and difficulties in social relations with family and
peers exert a heavy toll on youth who are often unable to
communicate the nature of their experience. It is a common
and serious problem. It increases the risk for suicide, the third
leading cause of death in this age-group.
Often, it leads to more poor academic achievement, greater
absenteeism, strained relationships with family and friends,
interference with extracurricular activities, and substance
abuse. Clinical depression during adolescence represents
the strongest risk factor for teenager suicide and is linked to
significant psychosocial impairment in adulthood.
Periodic screening of children presenting—for any reason—
to primary care physicians can improve clinical recognition of
these disorders and result in improved rates of treatment.
The importance of detecting and treating depression in
adolescents is being increasingly recognized.
Prevalence is related to age, gender, and social class (about
1% between 10 years and 14 years of age and 25% among late
teens).

Adolescents: affective and behavioral symptoms
Highly intelligent, academically strong children com­
pensate for mood disorders with increased attention to
academics
• Comorbidities: conduct disorder, defiant disorder, panic
disorder, attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder, anxiety
disorders, and disruptive disorders.
The US Preventive Services Task Force now recommends
screening adolescents (12–18 years) for major depressive
disorder when systems are in place to assure accurate
diagnosis, psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral or inter­
personal) and follow-up.
The American Academy of Pediatrics also strengthened
their recommendations for mental health screening and
counseling in the latest Bright Futures Guidelines.
The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care
(GLAD-PC) were published in 2007 and have been updated in
2010. Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care
provides provide a roadmap for enhancing care. This time
tool presents important elements from the 2010 GLAD-PC for
the identification, assessment, and treatment of adolescent
depression in the office setting.
• Systems must be in place to allow effective triage (safety/
placement) for:
{{ Identification of high risk cases
{{ Screening
{{ Assessment and intervention
{{ A predetermined “go-to” list of providers and facilities
to refer for care when indicated.
• The good news:
{{ Screening is simple, effective, and well received by
patients, parents, and providers
{{ A two-question screening can identify the need for
more in depth screening
{{ Adolescents prefer to have their depression addressed
in primary care
{{ Most adolescents see their primary doctor at least
annually; an estimated 45% of suicide victims
reportedly saw their primary doctor in the month prior
to the suicide
{{ Most depressed adolescents can be treated in primary
care
{{ There are effective treatments and guidelines for using
them in primary care
• The bad news
{{ Only about 1 of 3 adolescents with depression is identi­
fied (American College of Preventive Medicine, 2011)
{{ Fewer than half of primary care clinicians inquire
about depression with adolescents; fewer yet use a
standardized instrument to assess depression
{{ Fewer than half of adolescents who are diagnosed are
treated appropriately
{{ Severe cases should be treated by mental health
specialists, but there is a severe shortage of child
psychiatrists—few of these severe cases are seen by
specialists
{{ Reimbursement policies are often a disincentive to
treating depression in primary care

Little coordination typically occurs between primary
care and mental health specialties
The challenge
{{ The burden of adolescent depression prevention and
management falls squarely on primary care
{{ Most pediatricians and family practitioners believe it is
their responsibility to identify depression, but relatively
few believe it is their responsibility to treat it
{{ Most do not feel equipped to manage adolescent
depression, and their office systems are not set up to
handle it
{{ Adolescent depression is different than adult depression
due to developmental issues, responses to treatment,
issues in psychotherapy, risks of medications, family
dynamics
Steps to integrate care:
{{ Assess the practice: adolescent patient load, prevalence
of mental health issues
{{ Determine the role you want to play and services to
provide for adolescent depression
{{ Build a network of local resources: therapists, peer
counseling, group programs, etc.
{{ Determine relation with mental health resources:
consultation, colocation, collaboration
{{ Provide training where needed: screening/assessing,
record keeping, confidentiality (state law), staff
roles, insurance coverage including preapprovals
or preauthorizations for referrals; counseling/
psychotherapy training for designated staff
{{ Assure systems are in place to allow effective triage
(safety/placement) that includes a “go-to” list of
providers and facilities to send patients as needed
{{ Follow guideline recommendations

•

Depression is an illness, not a weakness; very common,
no one’s fault, usually involves genetic and environmental
factors
Functional impairment in various domains can be
manifestations of the illness
Depression can be a recurrent illness—recovery may take
a while
Key to overcoming depression is staying with the treatment
plan long term
Stress in the parent-child relationship, if present, may be
part of the problem
Ask adolescent about future goals—if none, be wary of
suicidal ideation.

Initial Management
•
•

Discuss limits of confidentiality
Emphasize monitoring symptoms, especially changes
reflecting increasing suicidal ideation.

Primary Care
•
•

Offer referral for peer/family support, community resources,
etc.
Facilitate parental and patient self-management; provide
written materials and websites for more information.

CONSIDER CONSULTATION
With mental health specialist: recommended for severe or
complicated depressions, or for interventions not within scope
of the pediatric practice:
• Decide to treat in practice or refer to trusted network of
mental health providers
• If referred, designate case coordination responsibilities;
follow-up plan
• Maintain contact with mental health specialist as long as
such treatment continues.

TREATMENT PLAN
If treating in practice:
• Include family: set specific goals for key areas of
functioning—home, peer relationships, school and work.
Mild depression:
• Active support and monitoring for 6–8 weeks, contact every
1–2 weeks
Moderate or severe:
• Initiate shared decision discussion about therapy:
{{ Psychotherapy and/or antidepressants
{{ Review benefits and risks of each option including
the black box warning regarding selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicide risk
• Discuss preferences and plan for chosen treatment:
{{ Emphasize importance of finding a therapist one feels
comfortable with for psychotherapy
• Discuss common medication side effects:
{{ Emphasizing temporary nature and importance of not
stopping medication without calling first

ch-24.indd 103

Discuss more serious adverse effects, especially
suicidal ideation; emphasize careful monitoring due to
increased risk earlier in treatment
Develop safety plan for acute crisis, deterioration of
symptoms
Consider ongoing mental health consultation
Evaluate response at 6–8 weeks (American College of
Preventive Medicine, 2011).

{{

•
•
•

FOLLOW-UP MANAGEMENT
(AT 6–8 WEEK VISIT)
Mild depression:
• If persistent: institute treatment as moderate cases or refer
to mental health
• If improved: continue monitoring monthly for 6 months,
regular follow-up for 2 years after resolution of symptoms.
Moderate or severe:
• If not improved
{{ Reassess the diagnosis
{{ Consider adding a medication, increasing the dosage,
or changing medications if already on maximum
dosage
{{ Add psychotherapy if not already using, or intensifying
current therapy
{{ Consider referral to mental health
{{ Provide further education, review safety plan, continue
ongoing monitoring
{{ Evaluate response again at 6–8 weeks
• If partially improved:
{{ Consider adding a medication or increasing the dosage
{{ Add psychotherapy if not already using, or intensifying
current therapy
{{ Consider referral to mental health
{{ Provide further education, review safety plan, continue
ongoing monitoring
{{ Evaluate response again at 6–8 weeks
• If improved:
{{ Continue prescribed medication for 1 year after
symptom resolution
{{ Continue monthly monitoring for 6 months
{{ Provide regular follow-up for 2 years after resolution of
symptoms.

Final Thoughts
Adolescent depression challenges everyone—from the affected
young person to the parents and providers, and the entire
healthcare system. The fragmented care and lack of support
for primary care undermines early identification and timely
treatment.
• Routine screening and diagnosis:
{{ Periodically screen children and youth for early signs of
depression and/or anxiety. Record these results in the
patient’s problem list
{{ Ask questions of the child (or parent where applicable)
when there are red flags including unexplained somatic
complaints, unexplained behavioral changes, teenage

pregnancy, school absences, and family members with
depression, anxiety, alcohol, or other substance abuse
Suggested questions
{{ Do you find yourself sad, irritable, or worried a lot?
{{ Is the child withdrawing from or avoiding their usual
activities?
{{ Family involvement is invaluable for assisting with and
monitoring treatments as well as providing assurance
and emotional support for the child or youth. Assure
the family that the questions and fact-finding is not to
assign blame but to better understand the situation
{{ Choose an appropriate diagnostic questionnaire
available for download on the internet. If the screen
indicates a possible problem then either begin or
schedule time to begin a detailed inquiry about anxiety
or depressive symptoms, evaluate severity, and the
potential for self-harm
{{ Consider that there may be more than one psychiatric
disorder when screening because anxiety and
depressive disorders are highly comorbid in children
and adolescents. All youth, with mood or anxiety
disorders should be screened for alcohol or drug use
{{ Note red flags for risk of bipolar depression: family
history, psychotic depression, mania with SSRIs,
hypersexuality, risk-taking behavior, and prepubertal
depression. Consider referral if bipolar disorder is
suspected. Manage the patient while waiting for
referral and provide follow-up
Diagnosis
{{ Take a medical history and do a physical examination
with attention to conditions that may mimic anxiety
or depressive disorders. Consider indications for
diagnostic tests such as thyroid-stimulating hormone.
Consider the family situation and social stressors
{{ Investigations: clinical basis, identify hypothyroidism
and anemia
Attempt nonpharmacological management strategies first:
{{ Nonpharmacological approaches are essential first line
treatments for both anxiety and depression. If physician
counseling, parental involvement, and use of books does

not effect a significant improvement, it is appropriate
to refer to a specialist or to the child and youth mental
health team for treatment (Algorithms 1–4).

Pharmacotherapy of major depressive disorder

•

MDD, major depressive disorder; SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors;
TCAs, tricyclic antidepressants; NaSSAs, noradrenergic and specific sero­
tonergic antidepressants; SNRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

INDICATIONS FOR PHARMACOTHERAPY
Indications for pharmacotherapy include persistent depression
and/or a comorbid anxiety disorder which have not responded
to psychosocial interventions.
Depression: psychotherapy can be effective for treating
depression, particularly in adolescents. If unavailable,
medications may be indicated:
• The drug most often used is fluoxetine
• If bipolar vulnerability, start with a shorter-acting SSRI
(e.g., sertraline)
• If comorbid anxiety, fluvoxamine or sertraline are possible
alternatives.
Spontaneous remission in community diagnosed adoles­
cent depression is 50% within 2 months. However, those not
remitting in this time period have a high risk of chronicity.
Refer to a specialist.

Medication Dosing and
Follow-up for Anxiety and Depression
General Dosing Suggestions
Start with one-fourth or half of the adult dose and wait at least 1
week to increase dosages. For adolescents, the maximum dose
can be similar to adults, while the dose is less than the adult
dose for children
• Anxiety: children who are anxious are sensitive to physical
sensations. Provide support, reassurance, and monitor
frequently. Generalized anxiety disorder may respond

ch-24.indd 105

at lower doses (e.g., 25–50 mg sertraline), obsessive
compulsive disorder (OCD) (100–200 mg sertraline),
generally start low and increase slowly. Dosing example: 10
mg daily fluoxetine for an adolescent. For an anxious 6 year
old, start with 5 mg daily and use increments of 5 mg every
2 weeks if needed
Depression: the response often requires full doses for youth
and the response to medication is slower. Example: start
the first week with 10 mg daily of fluoxetine and increase to
20 mg daily as soon as tolerated. Increase again up 30 mg
daily if not improved after 6 weeks to a maximum of 40 mg
daily. If not responding after 10–12 weeks, refer to specialist.

Adverse effects: in children, SSRIs and other new anti­
depressants produce a higher rate of behavioral and emotional
adverse effects (such as agitation, disinhibition, irritability, and
occasionally thoughts of self-harm). The largest drug-placebo
difference in the number of cases of suicidal ideation and
behavior is greatest for the under-24 age group. For all ages,
the risk is highest during the first few months of drug therapy,
therefore, monitor patients closely during this time
• Monitoring: request assistance of the family and/or
teenager, to monitor both symptoms and functions
• Continuation: for both anxiety and depression, the usual
length of treatment is 6–12 months before a trial of tapering
• Discontinuation: anxious patients are very sensitive to
physical sensations during discontinuation. So, taper off
particularly slowly over 1–2 months by approximately 5 mg
per reduction.

Antidepressants Commonly Used in
Treatment of Major Depressive Disorders (Table 1)
•

•

•

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (sertraline,
paroxetine, etc.): these medications are somewhat less
toxic in overdosage. As compared to adults, adolescents
are a bit more likely to become agitated or to develop a
mania while they are taking an SSRI. These medications
can decrease libido in both adolescents and adult.
Fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram are
commonly used as an initial medication. Fluoxetine now
has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the
treatment of depression in children and adolescents. The
other SSRI medications do not as of yet have FDA approval
for depression in children. These last two have fewer
interactions with other medications.
Bupropion (Wellbutrin): this medication can be helpful for
depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but
is less effective for comorbid anxiety. It does not seem to
cause weight gain.
Tricyclics (imipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline): these
medications are still used if the SSRIs and bupropion
do not work. As the tricyclics are more likely to cause
rhythm changes in children, baseline and periodic electro­
cardiograms (ECGs) should be considered. Side effects
may include dry mouth, dry eyes (problem if contact
wearer) dizziness, and ECG, pulse, and rhythm changes.
Clomipramine (anafranil) is quite effective in individuals
with OCD.

Prevalence of anxiety disorders in children aged 5–17 is
6.4%. The debilitating nature of these disorders is routinely
underestimated and the need for help may not be realized
until serious impairment in social and academic functioning
has occurred. Untreated anxiety disorders in children and
adolescents are associated with higher rates of comorbid
depression and substance abuse (Algorithm 5).

SUICIDE
Death due to suicide is more common in boys than girls.
Most acts of suicide are preceded by an expression of death
wish either to friends or to a trustworthy adult in the previous
24 hours. May be made impulsively without much forethought
or can be premeditated. Emotional development is at its peak

during middle adolescence, the control of emotions is still
incomplete due to evolving and immature prefrontal lobes.

Predisposing Factors
•
•
•

Adolescents with poor coping skills and problem solving
skills. Low levels of serotonin and its major metabolite
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
Chaotic childhood with problems during child rearing,
domestic violence, abusive adults
High achiever adolescent may resort to suicide when
humiliated for perceived failure. Adolescents with other
coexisting mental illnesses may resort to suicide as they are
vulnerable to stressors much more than normal population.

Approach to an Adolescent with Suicide Behavior
Adolescents should be posed directly about the existence
of suicide ideation. They may not have confided in parents,
hence parental history may not be reliable. Questions should
be developmentally appropriate as it helps in devising
management strategies in form of cognitive behavior therapy
and interpersonal therapy. All suicide ideation should be taken
seriously and evaluated thoroughly and repeatedly.
What, when, where, how, and why aspects of suicidal
behavior should be explored and evaluated.
What:
• Was the action
• Was the thoughts about life after death
• The adolescent expect to happen on completion of suicide
• Any alternative plans thought to accomplish the objective.

ch-24.indd 107

How:
• Was the plot to suicide conceived
• How were the steps planned
• Any previous attempts?
When and where:
• Was the suicidal action planned
• Where was the place chosen
• Where was the place where the suicidal note if any was
planned to be placed. Significant life events are chosen for
suicide.
Why:
• Psychological details are probed
• Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, emotional pain,
humiliation, emptiness, rejection, abandonment, fear of
death, fear of mental breakdown, self hatred, guilt.
Adolescents with multiple attempts usually take care to
execute the next in a manner which is difficult to intervene.
Single attempters usually equip themselves with coping skills
with time.
Suicide prevention can be primary, secondary, or tertiary:
• Primary suicide prevention aims to reduce the number of
new cases of suicide in the general population
• Secondary suicide prevention aims to decrease the
likelihood of a suicide attempt in high risk patients
• Tertiary suicide prevention occurs in response to
completed suicides and attempts to diminish suicide
contagion (clusters of suicides in a geographical area that
occur predominantly among teenagers and young adults)
and copy cat suicides.

Rating Scales for Suicide Behavior and
Related Mental Health Conditions
T﻿he most widely used scales for rating suicidal behaviors include:
• The Scale for Suicidal Ideation has good reported reliability
and validity and measures three major factors: (i) active
suicidal desire, (ii) specific plans for suicide, and (iii)
passive suicidal desire
• The Suicide Intent Scale measures the degree of suicide
intent
• The Risk-Rescue Rating Scale is an interviewer-adminis­
tered measure that assesses the lethality and intent of a
suicide attempt
• The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale assesses
severity of suicidal ideation and tracks suicidal events
• The Beck Hopelessness Scale is a self-report inventory
designed to measure three major aspects of hopelessness:
feelings about the future, loss of motivation, and expectations
• The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a clinicianapplied scale rating dimensions of depression
• The Beck Depression Inventory is a multiple choice selfreport inventory that measures the severity of depression.

by dexamethasone nonsuppression.

What are the Most Effective
Secondary Suicide Prevention Strategies?
In a recent systematic review of suicide prevention strategies,
Mann et al., found evidence of effectiveness in five secondary
suicide prevention methods:
1. Pharmacological interventions
2. Psychological interventions
3. Follow-up care
4. Reduced access to lethal means
5. Responsible media reporting of suicide (Algorithms 6
and 7).

Clinical Pearls
• Counselors and clinicians should actively use specialize tools
such as patient health questionnaire
• An algorithm of nonpharmacological intervention makes it
easier to manage depression
• Pharmacological management, when necessary, should follow
correct doses as per body weight and side effects have to be
monitored
• Treatment of adolescent depression/suicidal tendency is a
long-term process with regular monitoring and follow up as
small social and psychological trigger factors can produce
sudden relapse.

The Search for Biological Markers for Suicide

ch-24.indd 108

Many researchers have been trying to find biological markers
related to suicidal behavior that could improve secondary
suicide prevention. Several biological features related to
failures in neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems,
such as the serotonergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) systems, have
been proposed, e.g., considerable evidence accrued using
various research approaches suggests a potentially causal
association between suicidal behavior and the serotonin
neurotransmission system.
To date, the most promising biological predictors of
suicidal behavior are low cerebrospinal fluid 5-HIAA (the main

Teen Aggression:
Steps in Management
Kiran SK Vaswani

INTRODUCTION

Box 1: Three pathways/clusters

Aggression aimed at harming others and/or self, with many
negative outcomes, like violence, delinquency, substance
use, scholastic problems, is common in adolescence. It may
be the first sign/manifestation of childhood psychiatric
disorders or organic diseases. Therefore, it is imperative for
the primary caregiver to recognize aggression and intervene
early. Approximately 3–7% of school children have signs of
aggression.
The objective of this chapter is to understand the following
aspects of teen aggression:
• Definition, subtypes, and related term anger
• Normative development
• Risk and protective factors
• Related comorbidities
• Prevention and parent support
• Assessment and intervention: algorithm.

Definition, Subtypes,
and Related Term Anger
Anger is defined as a person’s response to a threat actual or
perceived, against an individual or group (Lazarus, 1991).
It may be adaptive or when uncontrolled, associated with
aggression.

• “Authority conflict” (avoidance/conflict): stubborn-disobedienceavoidance (truancy/running away from home)
• “Covert” (property loss): sneaky acts—stealing, vandalism
progressing to fraud and serious theft
• “Overt” (physical harm): starts with annoying, bullying, then
physical fighting to forced sex

Aggression is “any behavior intended to harm another
person who is motivated to avoid the harm”. Clusters of
aggression, a disruptive behavior, are as shown in box 1.
Aggression by definition is intentional, thus an autistic
teen’s aggression is not primary disruptive behavior.

Proactive and Reactive/Affective Aggression
Aggression can be proactive or reactive (affective), features of
these are summarized in table 1.

Disruptive Behavior Disorders
Disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) are characterized by
predominance of oppositional, defiant, or antisocial behaviors,
range from the milder oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) to
the more serious conduct disorder (CD). Features of DRD are
given in table 2.

Table 1: Features of proactive and reactive/affective aggression

ch-25.indd 110

Features
Purpose

Proactive (premeditated) aggression
• Obtain specific rewards/goals
• Establish social dominance

Reactive/affective (impulsive) aggression
• Learned behavioral response to abuse; perceive threat/
provocation in neutral/friendly situations

Relation to anger

• Calculated/cold-blooded
• No significant display of anger

• Emotionally driven/hot-blooded
• Visible display of anger

Peer relations

• Leadership skills and a sense of humor

• Peer rejection/victimization

Clinical implications and
prognosis

• Externalizing behavior/subsequent criminal
behavior uncommon

• Common psychotic symptoms/need lithium or
neuroleptics

Intervention implications

• Systematic interventions

• Cognitive behavioral therapy and medications

Duration of symptoms for diagnosis

For at least 6 months

Trouble with authority
Breaks school rules
Angry/argumentative
Noncompliant
Blame others for their errors
Have not broken major societal rules

Intermittent Explosive Disorder
This manifests in late adolescence as discrete episodes of
aggression, unrelated to stressors, remits spontaneously with
no impulsivity; unexplained by personality disorders/attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/substance intoxication,
is probably an epileptoid state with aura, postictal-like changes
in sensorium, responding to anti­convulsants, β-blockers, and
calcium channel inhibitors.

Normative Development
Aggression, a normal and highly frequent behavior in kids/
teens, facilitates competence in social assertiveness, games,
and developing autonomy. It is mostly directed towards peers,
and very little towards adult caregivers.

Risk and Protective Factors
Insight of these factors helps in prevention of and intervention
in aggression. Risk factors are depicted in figure 1 and box 2.
Protective factors contributing to a significant reduction in
antisocial behavior are listed in box 3.

Prevention of aggression
Parent support and other factors that contribute to prevention
of aggression are listed in box 4.

Significant aggression towards others
Animal cruelty
Destruction of property/theft/setting fires
Law breaking/serious violation of rules
Substance abuse
Poor school performance
Have broken major societal rules; suspended from
school or have police involvement

More than three incidents within the last 12 months,
and at least one in past 6 months

Box 2: Risk factors
• Age at onset of aggression: important risk factor for conduct
disorder (CD). Children displaying aggression are at the highest
risk for conduct related problems as adults
• Psychological maltreatment: neglect (infancy), humiliation,
rejection, witnessing intimate partner violence
• Physically and sexually abused: likely to become seriously
delinquent and violent juveniles
• Physical discipline by parents, models aggression as coping tool
• Media violence and internet addiction, extensively studied,
significant role in shaping the developing brain/“wired” for
aggression
• Vicious cycle exists between substance use and violence
• Associating with delinquent peers and gangs; peer group
rejection and victimization; females tend to be with the gang for
a refuge and belong to more troubled families
• Easy access to weapons
• Related psychiatric disorders: 65–95% of boys with CD have
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:
{{ Girls have depression with CD:
–– Look for comorbid conditions, especially suicidal attempts,
in girls with antisocial behavior as they are at a great risk
–– Other associations: anxiety, autism spectrum disorder,
intellectual disability, language deficits, bipolar disorder
• Social cognitive risk factor: aggressive children misread inter­
personal cues and interpret ambiguous/prosocial communi­
cation as hostile and react aggressively

Box 5: Assessment

• Kids/teens with several risk factors demonstrating intense
anger/loss of temper, extreme irritability/impulsiveness, or easy
frustration need to be evaluated/intervened
• Studies show aggression can be decreased/prevented by:
{{ Violence leads to violence, therefore, reduce exposure to
violence at home/community/media
{{ Prevention of child abuse. Victim identification, care and
support programs

Parent interview
• Child’s temperament as an infant and young child
• Development history and assessment, including language
• Details of disturbing behavior-onset, psychosocial stressors
(death/separation/crisis/loss of pet) at the onset
• Frequency, intensity, duration of an episode, triggers/trends,
degree of disruption
• Parenting styles, expectations, strategies for dealing with stress
• Media exposure
• Aggressive neighborhood
Adolescent interview
• Opportunity to observe:
{{ Evidence of anxiety, hyperactivity
{{ Motivation for change
• HEEADDSS assessment:
{{ Home: family dynamics, abuse, and neglect
{{ Education: peer activities, acceptance, bullying
{{ Activities: hobbies, media use, leisure, sleep
{{ Drugs: substance abuse
{{ Depression/suicide
{{ Sexual health: sexuality, sexual activity/abuse
{{ Safety: possession of arms, vehicle driving

Clinical Pearls

Teacher interview
• Behavior details
• Academic performance

• Teens with childhood onset of aggression are more likely to
manifest delinquent activity during adolescence, persisting
into adulthood compared to those with adolescent onset
• Aggression in a child at any age needs to be evaluated/
intervened and not dismissed as “child will grow out of it”
• Physically/sexually abused children and adolescents are more
likely to become seriously delinquent and violent juveniles
• Child neglect in infancy is associated with aggressive behavior
in childhood
• Media and aggression: children watching violent shows are
“more likely to strike out at playmates, argue, and disobey
authority and less willing to wait for things” Gerbner
• Look for comorbid conditions, especially suicide ideation and
attempts in girls with antisocial behavior
• Inquire and counsel for possible abuse
• Teens with symptoms of both attention deficit hyperactivity
and conduct disorders have poor outcomes.

Peer interview
• Behavior details
• Academic performance
• Bullying, participation in peer activities
Standardized Rating Scales: completed by teens, parents,
teachers
• Help in assessing: depression, anxiety, aggression, withdrawal,
inattention, hyperactivity, delinquent behavior, suicide ideation
• Based on others’ opinions
• Used in combination with other data
• The Youth Self Report, Child Behavior Checklist, Direct and
Indirect Aggression Scale: commonly used
Eliminate other diagnoses
• Mood disorders: major depression, bipolar disorder
• Anxiety disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized
anxiety disorder, panic attack
• Psychotic disorders: with active delusions or hallucinations
• Substance use: active phase or withdrawal
• Developmental disorders: autism, mental retardation
• Temporal lobe epilepsy, endocrinal disorders, intracranial space
occupying lesions, megaloblastic anemia

Assessment

112

ch-25.indd 112

Evaluate:
• Development related: short-lived, without significant/
persistent dysfunction
• Context of action: better prognosis when impulsive/on
peers’ encouragement than when planned and individually
executed
• Behavior details
• Comorbid conditions
• Eliminate other diagnoses
• Protective and risk factors
• Perception of the issue and motivation for change. Box 5
briefly enumerates the process of assessment.

Intervention
•
•
•

Effective strategies: group intervention—time and costeffective
Take necessary precautions to keep “self” safe
Targeting teens: cognitive behavioral therapy to change
social cognitive distortions involves practising alternative
ways of dealing with conflicts

11/24/2016 12:35:27 PM

Chapter 25: Teen Aggression: Steps in Management
•

Limitations: lack of motivation, immature cognition, and
language deficits
• Problem-solving skills training by role-playing, practising,
and homework assignments
• Glick’s aggression replacement therapy:
{{ Learning social skills through structured learning
training has 4 steps:
1. Shows behavior (saying thank you/sorry/asking for
permission)
2. Try the skill by role-playing
3. Practise
4. Use in actual situations
{{ Anger control training: identify triggers, cues, self-talk,
use reducers (deep-breathing), and self-evaluation
{{ Moral education: justice, personal rights/responsi­
bilities
• Parent involvement (parent management training):
parents trained to observe, teach prosocial behavior by
role-playing, practising, and feedback
• Adolescent transition program: parenting skills, improved
family relationships and communication, limit-setting,
and problem-solving
• Family therapy to improve communication, reduce
blaming
Tips for parents (and teachers) to deal with an aggressive
adolescent are listed in table 3.
Teens and parents inclusive interventions (most effective):
• Schools: prosocial peers
• Life skills programs
• Utilize mental health professionals to train teachers,
counsel teens and parents involve in school and community
activities
Media literacy and deconstruction exercises:

•

Develop critical viewing skills to make kids/teens less
susceptible to negative messages of media
• Monitor television viewing habits
• Role-model: limit time and content
• Discuss media contents and deconstruct:
{{ Does it resemble any person/situation in real life?
{{ Was there a problem/conflict and how was it solved?
Can we adopt these methods? Given a choice what
would have been your strategy?
{{ What are victim’s feelings? Was it possible to avoid
hurting/harming them? How?
Risk factors and comorbidities: identify and treat appropriately:
• Medication: as an adjunct to behavioral therapy
• Mainly for comorbid conditions: depression, anxiety,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine
• No specific antiaggressive agents, mood stabilizers, anti­
epileptic drugs—valproate, or atypical antipsychotics used
• Risperidone in severe aggression affecting function
• Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors useful in irritable
depressed/anxious.

Clinical Pearls
• Behavioral interventions are the mainstay of treatment
• Effective strategies include all stakeholders in management:
the teen, parents, school, peers, and the community
• Medication has a limited role in management of aggression.

Prompt referral to the expert:
• Escalating behavior, from vandalism to harming
• Multiple domains of involvement: mood, substance,
psychotic, suicide ideation/attempts.

Key points

))
Behavioral and mental health concerns are common in
pediatrician’s office practice, and aggression is both a
challenging and significant concern
))
Aggression may represent a normal developmental stage
or indicate a serious mental health disorder, and has grave
implications for both the individual and his family and also
community at large
))
As clinicians, we need to identify those with multiple risk
factors, and suggest interventions before the behavior
becomes chronic, severe, and frequent
))
Identify comorbidities and deal with them
))
Consider medical causes of aggression
))
Effective strategies of management involve teens, parents,
and schools.

Chapter

Immunization in Childhood
Monjori Mitra

INTRODUCTION
Along with the routine vaccines in national immunization
program, Indian Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine
vaccination to prevent other vaccine-preventable diseases that
occur in infants, children, and adolescents.
There has been a constant surveillance of the various
vaccine-preventable diseases and the outcome has prompted
the various advisory bodies to reschedule the vaccination
program based on the reports.
The schedule recommended is based on the best
seroprotective outcome of the vaccines which are being
continuously studied in various environmental settings. The
vaccination providers should try to influence the community
or the individual to follow the same to get the best protective
efficacy for individual and community.
Optimal response to a vaccine depends on multiple factors,
including the type of vaccine, age of the recipient, and immune
status of the recipient. Recommendations for the age at which
vaccines are administered are influenced by age-specific
risks for disease, age-specific risks for complications, agespecific responses to vaccination, and potential interference
with the immune response by passively transferred maternal
antibodies. Vaccines are recommended for members of the
youngest age group at risk for experiencing the disease for
which efficacy and safety have been demonstrated.
Certain products, including inactivated vaccines, toxoids,
recombinant subunit vaccines, polysaccharide conjugate
vaccines, and live vaccines, require two doses or more to
elicit an adequate antibody response. Tetanus and diphtheria
toxoids require booster doses to maintain protective antibody
concentrations. Unconjugated polysaccharide vaccines do
not induce T-cell memory, and additional doses (although
they elicit the same or a lower antibody concentration)
might increase the level of protection. Conjugation with a
protein carrier improves the effectiveness of polysaccharide
vaccines by inducing T-lymphocyte-dependent immunologic
function. Many vaccines that stimulate both cell-mediated

ch-26.indd 115

immunity and neutralizing antibodies (e.g., live, attenuated
virus vaccines) usually can induce prolonged immunity, even
if antibody titers decline over time. Subsequent exposure to
such viruses usually results in a rapid anamnestic antibody
response without viremia.
Approximately, 90–95% of recipients of a single dose
of certain live vaccines administered by injection at the
recommended age (i.e., measles, rubella, and yellow fever
vaccines) develop protective antibodies, generally within 14
days of the dose. For varicella and mumps vaccines, 80–85%
of vaccines are protected after a single dose. However, because
a limited proportion (5–15%) of measles, mumps, and rubella
(MMR) or varicella vaccines fails to respond to first dose, a
second dose is recommended to provide another opportunity
to develop immunity. Of those who do not respond to the
first dose of MMR or varicella vaccine, 97–99% responds to a
second dose.

COMBINATION VACCINES AND DRUG
CONTROLLER GENERAL OF INDIA LICENSURE
Only combination vaccines licensed by Drug Controller
General of India (DCGI) should be used. Vaccination providers
should not combine separate vaccines into the same syringe to
administer together unless mixing is indicated for the patient’s
age and is explicitly specified on the DCGI-approved product
label inserts. Only two combination vaccines [diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae
type b (DTaP-IPV/Hib) vaccine] contain separate antigen
components for which DCGI approves mixing by the user.
The safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of unlicensed
combinations are unknown and should not be used.

INTERCHANGEABILITY OF FORMULATIONS
Regulatory body generally licenses a combination vaccine
based on studies demonstrating that the product’s immuno­
genicity (or efficacy) and safety are comparable or equivalent

11/19/2016 12:47:29 PM

Section 3: Immunization
to monovalent or combination products licensed previously.
The combination vaccine may be used interchangeably with
monovalent formulations and other combination products
with similar component antigens produced by the same
manufacturer to continue the vaccination series. For example,
DTaP, DTaP/Hib, and future DTaP vaccines that contain similar
acellular pertussis antigens from the same manufacturer may
be used interchangeably, if licensed and indicated for the
patient’s age.
Ideally, the doses of vaccine in a series should be from the
same manufacturer; however, if this is not possible or if the
manufacturer of doses given previously is unknown, providers
should administer the vaccines that are available.

VACCINATION ALGORITHM

•

•

Catch-up Vaccination
•

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Vaccine
•

Routine Vaccination

This should be given at birth before discharge from the
hospital or at first contact
Catch-up may be given up to 5 years.

•
•

Hepatitis B Vaccine
•

•
•
•
•
•

Minimum age of administration is at birth. Administer
monovalent hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns before
hospital discharge. Hepatitis B vaccine may also be given
in any of the following schedules:
{{ At birth, 1, and 6 months
{{ At birth, 6, and 14 weeks
{{ At 6, 10, and 14 weeks
{{ At birth, 6, 10, and 14 weeks, etc.
Monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used for doses
administered before age of 6 weeks
Administration of a total of four doses of hepatitis B vaccine
is permissible when a combination vaccine containing
hepatitis B is administered after the birth dose
Infants who did not receive a birth dose should receive
three doses of a hepatitis B containing vaccine starting as
soon as feasible
The ideal minimum interval between first and second dose
is 4 weeks, and between second and third dose is 8 weeks
Ideally, the final (third or fourth) dose in the hepatitis B
vaccine series should be administered not earlier than the
age of 24 weeks and at least 16 weeks after the first dose.

Catch-up Vaccination
•
•

Administer the three-dose series to those not previously
vaccinated
In catch-up vaccination, use 0, 1, and 6 months schedule.

Poliovirus Vaccines: Oral Polio Vaccine/
Inactivated Polio Vaccine
•

ch-26.indd 116

Inactivated polio vaccine catch-up schedule: two doses
at 2 months apart followed by a booster after 6 months of
previous dose.

Diphtheria, Tetanus Toxoids,
and Pertussis Vaccine

•

116

Oral polio vaccine: at 6 months with hepatitis B and at
9 months with measles
{{ Additional doses of OPV on all national immunization
days and subnational immunization days
Booster dose: 18 months with first booster
{{ Inactivated polio vaccine: two instead of three doses
can also be used if primary series started at 8 weeks
{{ Inactivated polio vaccine catch-up schedule: two doses
at 2 months apart followed by a booster after 6 months.

Birth dose: oral polio vaccine (OPV) before discharge from
hospital
{{ Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV): 6, 10, and 14 weeks.

or unavailable

•
•

•
•
•

Minimum age: 6 weeks
The first booster (fourth dose) may be administered as
early as age 12 months, provided at least 6 months have
elapsed since the third dose
Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)
vaccine/combinations should preferably be avoided for
the primary series
Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis may be preferred
to Diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP) in
children with history of severe adverse effects after previous
dose/s of DTwP or children with neurologic disorders
First and second boosters may also be of DTwP. However,
considering a higher reactogenicity, DTaP can be consi­
dered for the boosters
If any “acellular pertussis” containing vaccine is used, it
must at least have three or more components in the product
No need of repeating/giving additional doses of wholecell pertussis vaccine to a child who has earlier completed
their primary schedule with acellular pertussis vaccinecontaining products.

Catch-up above 7 years: Tdap, Td, and Td at 0, 1, and
6 months, respectively.

Haemophilus influenzae Type B Conjugate Vaccine
Minimum age: 6 weeks as combination with DTwP/DTaP.
Primary series includes Hib conjugate vaccine at ages 6, 10,
and 14 weeks with a booster at age 12 through 18 months.

Missed Immunization
Ritabrata Kundu

Introduction
Vaccine regimen for children whose vaccine has been missed
or delayed should preferably be individualized, but certain
general principles should be followed. As vaccines produce
immunological memory, any delay between recommended
doses does not require reinitiation of the entire vaccine
series. Administrations of vaccine at intervals shorter than
recommended minimal interval produce poor immunological
response and should be avoided.
Two or more live injectable vaccines, administered at
shorter intervals, inhibits immunological response to the
second or later dose. Whereas oral live virus vaccines do not
interfere with injectable live vaccines administered at any
time interval. Hence, two or more live injectable vaccines
can either be given simultaneously or 4 weeks minimal
interval is needed between doses. Inactivated vaccines and
live vaccines can be administered simultaneously or at any
interval between the doses.
If live vaccines are inadvertently administered at an
interval of less than 4 weeks, revaccination with the second
vaccine should be done.
Simultaneous administration of several vaccines may be
needed at the same sitting, if the chances of the child’s return
to the vaccine facility are minimal. If more than one injection
has to be given in the same limb, thigh is preferred for its large
muscle mass, but 1–2 inches gap between two injection sites
should be maintained to prevent overlapping of local reaction.
Tables 1, 2, and 3 shows different vaccine schedules in three
age groups, namely between 6 months and 1 year, at 3 years
and at 5 years respectively..
Child with unknown or undocumented immunization
states should be considered as unimmunized and should be
vaccinated accordingly.

Animal Bites
Jaydeep Choudhury

INTRODUCTION
Rabies is a fatal encephalitis. It is a zoonotic disease and
transmission to humans occurs by bite of an infected animal.
In India, the transmitting animal is dog in more than 95% cases.
Though rabies is fatal, once symptoms of the disease develop,
it is almost 100% preventable if prophylactic measures are
instituted soon after the exposure.

PROBLEMS OF
RABIES INFECTION IN CHILDREN
In India and other developing countries, 50–60% of all rabies
deaths occur in children (<15 years of age). There are several
reasons as to why children are more susceptible:
• Children play in the streets and are more prone for dog
bites. Because of their playful nature, they also tend to
tease dogs and in consequence, dogs attack them
• Because of their short stature, bites on heads, neck, and
upper parts of the body are more common and bites tend
to be severe. This results in greater risk for infection with
relatively shorter incubation period. Because of their short
stature, even bites on lower parts of the body may result in
shorter incubation period
• Many times, because of the fear of painful injections that
may be given, they even tend to hide the fact that they were
bitten

•

As children have soft skin, even minor scratches and trivial
bites may result in category III exposures.

POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS
In rabies endemic country like India, every animal bite is
potentially suspected as a rabid animal bite; the treatment
should be started immediately. Rabies has long incubation
period. Prophylactic postexposure treatment should be started
at the earliest to ensure that the individual will be immunized
before the rabies virus reaches the nervous system. The
classification of animal bite for postexposure prophylaxis
(PEP) has been based on these World Health Organization
recommendations (Table 1).
Vaccination status of the biting animal: history of rabies
vaccination in an animal is not always a guarantee that the
biting animal is not rabid. Animal vaccine failures may occur
because of improper administration or poor quality of the
vaccine, poor health status of the animal, and the fact that one
vaccine dose does not always provide long-lasting protection
against infection in dogs.
Observation of biting animal: the treatment should always
be started immediately after animal bite. The treatment may
be modified if animal involved (dog or cat) remains healthy
throughout an observation period of 10 days by converting

Section 3: Immunization
PEP to preexposure vaccination by skipping the vaccine dose
on day 14 and administering it on day 28 while using Essen
schedule. The observation period is valid for dogs and cats
only. The natural history of rabies in mammals other than
dogs or cats is not fully understood and therefore the 10-day
observation period is not applicable.

A properly immunized child can only take one dose of tetanus
toxoid if there is a lapse of a period of 5 years from the last dose
of tetanus toxoid.
To prevent sepsis in the wound, a suitable course of an
antibiotic may be recommended.

Approach to Postexposure Prophylaxis

The RIG provides passive immunity to tide over the initial
phase of the infection.
Two types of RIGs are available:
1. Equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG): it is of hetero­
logous origin raised by hyperimmunization of horses. The
currently manufactured ERIGs are highly purified and
enzyme refined, with these preparations, the occurrence of
adverse reaction has been significantly reduced.
2. Human rabies immunoglobulins (HRIGs): as it is
homologous, HRIG is free from the side effects encountered
in a serum of heterologous origin, and because of their
longer half-life, are given in half the dose of equine
antirabies serum.
Dose of rabies immunoglobulins:
• The dose of ERIG is 40 IU/kg body weight of patient and
is given after testing for sensitivity, up to a maximum of
3,000 IU. The ERIG produced in India contains 300 IU/mL
• The dose of the HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight (maximum
1,500 IU). HRIG does not require any prior sensitivity
testing. HRIG preparation is available in concentration of
150 IU/mL.

The PEP consists of three parameters and should be done
simultaneously as per the category of the bites:
1. Management of animal bite wound(s)
2. Passive immunization: rabies immunoglobulins (RIGs)
3. Active immunization: antirabies vaccines (ARVs).

Management of Animal Bite Wound
Wound toilet: since the rabies virus enters the human body
through a bite or scratch, it is imperative to remove as much
saliva as possible. Since the rabies virus can persist and even
multiply at the site of bite for a long time, wound toilet must be
performed even if the patient reports late (Table 2).
Prompt and gentle thorough washing with soap or
detergent and flushing the wound with running water for 10
minutes can do this.
The application of irritants is unnecessary and damaging.
In case irritants have been applied on the wound, enough
gentle washing with soap or detergent to remove the extraneous
material, especially oil, should be done followed by flushing
with copious amount of water for 10 minutes immediately.
Application of antiseptic: after thorough washing and
drying the wound, any one of the available chemical agents
should be applied, viz.: povidone iodine (solution), alcohol,
chloroxylenol, chlorhexidine gluconate, and cetrimide solution
in appropriate recommended dilution.
Local infiltration of RIGs: in category III bites, RIG should be
infiltrated in the depth and around the wound to inactivate the
locally present virus as described below.
Suturing of wound: it should be avoided as far as possible. If
surgical intervention is unavoidable, minimum loose sutures
should be applied after adequate local treatment along with
proper infiltration of RIGs.
Tetanus toxoid injection (anti-tetanus prophylaxis): this should
be given to those children who had not received a booster dose.

Rabies Immunoglobulin

Administration of immunoglobulins: as much of the calculated
dose of RIG as is anatomically feasible should be infiltrated
into and around the wounds. Remaining, if any, after all
wounds have been infiltrated, should be administered by deep
intramuscular (IM) injection at an injection site distant from
the vaccine injection site. The total recommended dose of
immunoglobulin must not be exceeded as it may suppress the
antibody production by the vaccine.
If immunoglobulin was not administered when vaccination
was begun, it can be administered up to the seventh day after
the administration of the first dose of vaccine.
In circumstances where no immunoglobulins are available,
greater emphasis should be given to proper wound toileting
followed by Essen schedule of cell-culture vaccine (CCV) with
double dose on day 0 at two different sites intramuscularly
(0 day: 2 doses on left and right deltoid, following the single

dose on each day, i.e., day 3, 7, 14, and 28). It is emphasized
that doubling the first dose of CCV is not a replacement to
RIG. A full course of vaccine should follow thorough wound
cleansing and passive immunization.

{{

Antirabies Vaccines
Active immunization is achieved by administration of safe and
potent CCVs or purified duck embryo vaccines (PDEV). The
dosage schedule of cell culture rabies vaccine (CCV/CCRV) is
same irrespective of the body weight or age of the children.
• Storage and transportation: it is recommended that these
vaccines should be kept and transported at a temperature
range of 2–8°C. Freezing does not damage the lyophilized
vaccine but there are chances of breakage of ampoule
containing the diluent. Liquid vaccines should never be
frozen
• Reconstitution and storage: the lyophilized vaccine should
be reconstituted with the diluent provided with the vaccine
immediately prior to use. In case of unforeseen delay it
should be used within 6–8 hours of reconstitution.
Intramuscular regimen: the currently available vaccines and
regimens in India for IM administration are described below.
• Antirabies vaccines:
{{ Cell-culture vaccines:
–– Human diploid cell vaccine: produced locally in
private sector
–– Purified chick embryo cell vaccine: produced
locally in private sector
–– Purified vero-cell rabies vaccine: imported and
produced locally in public and private sectors
{{ Purified duck embryo vaccine:
–– Produced locally in private sector.
Note: All CCRVs and purified duck embryo vaccine used for
PEP should have potency (antigen content) greater than
2.5 IU/dose.
• Regimen:
{{ Essen schedule (5-dose IM regimen): the course for
PEP should consist of IM administration of 5 injections
on day 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Day 0 indicates date of first
injection
{{ Site of inoculation: the anterolateral thigh region is
ideal for the inoculation of these vaccines in infants
and younger children, whereas the older children
can take in deltoid regions. Gluteal region is not
recommended because the fat present in this region
retards the absorption of antigen and hence impairs
the generation of optimal immune response.
Intradermal (ID) regimens: it consists of administration of
a fraction of IM dose of CCVs on multiple sites in the layers
of dermis of skin. The use of ID route leads to considerable
savings in terms of total amount of vaccine needed for full
pre- or postexposure vaccination, thereby reducing the cost
of active immunization. In ID route, small amount (0.1 mL) of
rabies vaccines/antigen is deposited in the layers of the skin at
two or more sites:
• Intradermal vaccine regimen:

ch-28.indd 125

{{

Updated Thai Red Cross Schedule (2-2-2-0-2): this
involves injection of 0.1 mL of reconstituted vaccine
per ID site and on two such ID sites per visit (one
on each deltoid area, an inch above the insertion of
deltoid muscle) on day 0, 3, 7, and 28. The day 0 is the
day of first-dose administration of intradermal rabies
vaccines (IDVR) (ID inoculation of ARV) and may not
be the day of rabies exposure/animal bite
Antirabies treatment centers which meet the following
criteria may use ID administration:
–– Have adequately trained staff to give IDRV
–– Can maintain cold chain for vaccine storage
–– Ensure adequate supply of suitable syringes and
needles for ID administration
–– Are adequately well versed in management of open
vial and safe storage practices.

Postexposure Therapy for Previously Vaccinated
Children
Children who have previously received full PEP or preexposure
vaccination (either by IM or ID routes) with a potent CCV
should now be given only two booster doses: IM (0.5 mL/1 mL)/
ID (0.1 mL at 1 site) on day 0 and 3 irrespective of the duration
of previous vaccination. Proper wound toilet should be done.
Treatment with RIG is not necessary.

Preexposure Vaccination of Children
As rabies is a 100% fatal disease and children constitute a
special risk for getting the infection, it may be advisable to
vaccinate children after they attain the age of 3 years and start
playing in the streets and may come in contact with street or
pet dogs.

Schedule of Preexposure Vaccination
•

Intramuscular: 3 doses of any CCVs (1 mL or 0.5 mL
depending on the brand) administered on the anterolateral
thigh on day 0, 7, and 28
• Intradermal: the dose is same for all vaccine brands and
0.1 mL is administered ID over the deltoid on day 0, 7,
and 28.
The management of children exposed to animal bites is
shown in algorithm 1.

Clinical Pearls
• The transmitting animal of rabies is dog in more than 95%
cases
• Rabies is fatal once symptoms of the disease develop, but
it is almost 100% preventable if prophylactic measures are
instituted soon after the exposure
• Intradermal rabies vaccination is given in state run rabies
clinics, where many people come for rabies vaccine daily
• Rabies immunoglobulins is not needed for person who have
received full course of rabies vaccine.

Adverse Event Following
Immunization
Amar J Chitkara

INTRODUCTION
Childhood morbidity and mortality has witnessed tre­
mendous decrease following widespread immunization in
the last 30–40 years across the globe. Many new vaccines
are being developed and introduced in both the public and
private sectors. Though the vaccines are of documented safety
and efficacy, yet infrequently have adverse events. These
adverse events can be a strong deterrent to the acceptability
of vaccines; hence it is imperative to have a comprehensive
surveillance system to address these concerns, especially
with the introduction of many new vaccines/products
and that too in a country with 27 million births per year
and an extensive expanded program of immunization
with constraints of medical care access. The adverse event
following immunization (AEFI) is defined as “a medical
incident that takes place after immunization, causes concern,
and is believed to be caused by the immunization”.

WHY REPORT ADVERSE
EVENT FOLLOWING IMMUNIZATION?
Vaccines are always administered to healthy infants and
children to provide protection against dreadful diseases, hence
any alteration in health with a temporal association with the
vaccine be it fever, erythema, local pain and swelling, or a
major event leading to disability, hospitalization, or death,
erodes the confidence of the caregivers in the program and
any nonacceptance can have serious outcomes as regards
morbidity and mortality by vaccine preventable deaths (VPDs).
Ironically, with widespread vaccination, the disease burden
decreases and even mild AEFI become noticeable.

NATIONAL ADVERSE EVENT
FOLLOWING IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM
Though started along with Universal Immunization Program
in 1985, the real thrust started only in 2005 in collaboration

AEFI reports during the year. The initiative by the Indian
Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) to collaborate with the national
program has been a welcome step. The detailed operational
guidelines and standard operating procedures are available in
the public domain as well as print. The cases are then taken
up for causality assessment as per the standard WHO protocol
(Algorithm 1).

WHAT TO REPORT
Serious AEFI, such as death, disability, and hospitalization,
need to be reported immediately while minor AEFI, such
as fever, local reactions, etc., are reported through monthly
reports in the public health. The reporting hierarchy and the
timelines are given in algorithm 2. From the programmatic

reaches the concerned district immunization officer (DIO),
state immunization officer, and Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare (MoHFW) for appropriate action. Also, the fear and
anxiety of IAP members in reporting has been allayed to a
great extent by official communication and talks with MoHFW
in this regard. The doctors can also report to their district
immunization officers, medical officer, of nearest primary
health center directly. The event is then investigated by DIO
and the local AEFI committee; however, the reporting physician
is expected to cooperate. The keyword remains creating
awareness about utility of AEFI reporting and allaying fears
associated with reporting. An increased collaboration with
the various AEFI committees and nominating the practicing
physicians to these committees can further augment national
AEFI program.

Clinical Pearl

REPORTING FROM PRIVATE SECTOR

• Report adverse event following immunization and feel safe.

It has been estimated that about 9% of the national population
gets vaccinated at private facilities and there exists a
considerable heterogeneity varying from 10 to 30%, especially
being high in urban and metros across the country. The
AEFI reporting from private sector has been exceptionally
low because of a fear of reporting and harassment following
the event. It should also be noted that since all new vaccines
evolve from the private sector, the AEFI from this sector has a
very high potential for assessing the safety of these vaccines.
Since 2011, IAP has taken an initiative to collaborate with
national AEFI program to encourage reporting. The infectious
disease surveillance, a web and SMS-based surveillance of
VPDs has a built in portal of reporting AEFI that follows the
standard operating procedures. The information automatically

Approach to Respiratory
Distress in Children
Narendra R Nanivadekar

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory distress is one of the most common complaints
presenting to the pediatric emergency department. It requires
a rapid yet systematic assessment to facilitate diagnosis and
quick efficient management, because many conditions causing
respiratory distress have the potential to lead to respiratory
failure. Thus, a systematic approach can help us to recognize
respiratory distress sufficiently early, even before it progresses
to respiratory failure, and initiate appropriate supportive and
specific management which can dramatically improve the
outcome.

APPROACH
This section discusses the diagnostic approach to respiratory
distress. Management of respiratory distress is dealt with in
another section subsequently.

Initial Impression
The first step is a quick audiovisual assessment done within
seconds of establishing contact with the child. The aim is to
identify the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),
and prioritize interventions before proceeding further with a
detailed systematic assessment (Table 1).
This is followed by detailed evaluation which consists of
primary, and secondary assessments and diagnostic tests. This
helps us to identify the type and severity of the problem.

irritable, alert)
Increased work of breathing, absent/decreased
respiratory effort, or abnormal sounds heard

Primary Assessment
Primary assessment is a hands-on evaluation of airway,
breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure, which, includes
vital signs and pulse oximetry.

Airway
Airway patency can be checked by looking for the movement of
the chest and abdomen and listening for the air movement and
breath sounds (Table 2).
A child with a foreign body airway obstruction may
require an advanced airway technique like laryngoscopy or
bronchoscopy. Increased inspiratory effort with retractions,
abnormal inspiratory sounds (snoring or high-pitched stridor)
suggests that the child has upper airway obstruction (UAO).
Episodes where no airway or breath sounds are present despite
respiratory effort may suggest complete airway obstruction.

Breathing
Evaluation of breathing is helpful to diagnose majority of
causes of respiratory distress. Evaluation includes:
• Respiratory rate
• Effort
• Chest expansion and air movement

Lung and airway sounds
O2 saturation by pulse oximetry.
Respiratory rate should be evaluated before the hands-on
evaluation as anxiety and agitation will make it difficult to assess.
Children with respiratory distress are typically tachypneic.
Though the normal respiratory rate varies with age, for
practical purposes, at any age respiratory rate greater than 60
indicates abnormality. Though nonspecific, it is the first sign of
respiratory distress. Quiet tachypnea (with normal respiratory
effort) may be due to nonpulmonary causes like fever, anemia,
pain, sepsis, congestive cardiac failure, or mild metabolic
acidosis. Bradypnea may be due to either neuromuscular
weakness primarily or after persistent tachypnea leading
to fatigue secondarily. Either way it is an ominous sign.
Occasionally, it may be due to central causes. Any respiratory
rate below 10 per minute requires further evaluation.

Clinical Pearl
• Bradycardia when associated with other signs of decreased
perfusion, most commonly indicates hypoxia, and is an
ominous sign demanding urgent action.

Respiratory effort: usually, a child with respiratory distress
will have increased effort. Increased effort will be seen as
nasal flaring, use of other accessory muscles, retractions,
head bobbing or see-saw respirations. Additionally, we may
encounter prolonged inspiration or expiration, open mouth
breathing, or gasping. Grunting indicates that the child has
severe respiratory distress.
Nasal flaring will be seen commonly in infants and younger
children. Subcostal, substernal, or intercostal retractions
indicate mild distress whereas supraclavicular, suprasternal,
or sternal retractions suggest severe distress. The type of
retractions may also vary with the site of disease—predominant
suprasternal retractions are seen in UAO, intercostal retractions
in parenchymal lung disease, and subcostal retractions in
lower airway obstruction (LAO) (Table 3).
Head bobbing is a sign of respiratory failure and warrants
an early intervention. Similarly see-saw respiration is
characteristic of neuromuscular weakness in infants and

Chest wall expansion: decreased or asymmetric chest wall
expansion can be due to inadequate effort, airway obstruction,
atelectasis, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion,
mucus plug, or foreign, body aspiration. By and large the
diseased side would be moving less.
Air movement: while normal inspiratory sounds will be soft
quiet noises with observed inspiratory effort, expiration may
be short and quiet, at times inaudible. Presence of abnormal
sounds along with respiratory distress often gives clue to the
diagnosis.
Pulse oximeter can be considered as another vital sign
which may indicate hypoxia long before cyanosis or bradycardia
is evident. Preferably it should be done continuously during
stabilization of the patient.

Circulation
Circulation assessment consists of evaluation of heart rate
and rhythm, pulses (both central and peripheral), capillary
refill time, skin color and temperature, and blood pressure.
This needs to be done to complete the overall evaluation
of the patient and to categorize whether the child also has a
circulatory disorder which may be secondary to the respiratory
insufficiency or may be coexisting.

Disability
The aim is to assess the neurological perfusion/function, either
by the alert, voice, pain, unresponsive (AVPU scale) or the
Glasgow Coma Scale.

Exposure
This will give an idea about the presence of bruises, petechiae,
and the body temperature of the child.

This is to be done after primary assessment is completed and

by the mnemonic SAMPLE: Signs and symptoms, Allergies,
Medications, Past medical history, Last meal, Events. This can
be followed with a focused physical examination. This should
include careful assessment of the primary area of concern of
the illness or injury.

children and also indicates that the patient is getting fatigued
fast and needs urgent intervention.

These are performed to confirm the diagnosis or to determine
the severity of illness. They are chiefly laboratory evaluation
like complete blood count, arterial blood gas, biochemistry,
and radiology like X-ray, computed tomography scan, etc.
At any point of time, if a life-threatening situation is
encountered, one must initiate CPR (Table 4).
In view of the potential life-threatening situation, a detailed
history taking may be done only after the child is stabilized
(Table 5).

GENERAL APPROACH TO
A CHILD IN RESPIRATORY DISTRESS

132

Children, who present with breathlessness to the emergency
department, are likely to be suffering from respiratory, cardiac,
or metabolic conditions. The history is extremely useful in
deciding the probable etiology of breathlessness. A careful
evaluation of what the chief complaint/s is/are, as well as the
onset, duration, and progress of the same, provide valuable
clues. Specific findings on physical examination can further
suggest the probable diagnosis.
The most common causes of breathlessness are
“respiratory”. If one identifies the problem to be primarily
respiratory, after the assessment one should be able to decide
the physiological type of the problem and the severity of the
respiratory problem in the patient, which may help us in
initiating a specific treatment.
Based on the severity, respiratory problems can be classified
into respiratory distress and respiratory failure (Table 6).

Respiratory Distress
Respiratory distress is a clinical state characterized by
abnormal respiratory rate or effort. It is commonly charac­
terized by tachypnea and increased respiratory effort
(increased work of breathing). Thus, it is a physiological state
in which the child is trying to maintain adequate gas exchange
despite a respiratory pathology, by increasing the rate and
effort. However, in the absence of effective intervention, a
point may be reached at which adequate gas exchange can no
longer be maintained in spite of the increased rate and effort.
When this happens, the child is said to have progressed into
the state of respiratory failure.
During this progression, at times, the respiratory rate and
effort may actually fall secondary to respiratory fatigue; thus, at
times, severe respiratory distress is clinically evident in the form
of hypoventilation, and is an indication of respiratory failure.

Respiratory Failure
Respiratory failure is defined as inadequate oxygenation,
ventilation, or both. Since respiratory distress and respiratory
failure represent a continuum, respiratory failure can be
identified clinically by recognizing definite clinical signs
of hypoxemia or hypercarbia, in addition to the signs of
respiratory distress (Table 7).
Though neurological illnesses can lead to “breathlessness”,
they are unlikely to present with breathlessness as the only/
chief complaint. Whether the neurological illness is acute
(head injury, encephalitis, or meningitis) or subacute/
chronic (Guillain-Barré syndrome, or spinal muscular
atrophy) there will usually be a prominent history of the
initiating/primary events which will suggest the possible
cause of hypo/hyperventilation. It is important to note that
alteration of sensorium in a child with hypo/hyperventilation
does not necessarily mean a primary neurological illness; it

could be the end result of any progressive cardiorespiratory
pathology as well. Similarly, though see-saw respiration is
classically seen in neuromuscular weakness, it could be seen
as a preterminal event in any severe respiratory pathology.
Therefore, as mentioned above, the history is crucial.
If the clinical signs suggest that the type of respiratory
problem is “lung tissue disease”, the more common causes
are pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
and cardiac causes. The detection of cardiac failure, shock, or
cyanosis may suggest a cardiac cause of breathlessness (Table 8).

Clinical Pearl
• In general, management of respiratory distress does not require
an immediate chest radiograph; most conditions are apparent
clinically and waiting for radiography to initiate treatment can
waste precious time.

Recognition of Child in Shock
Kiran SK Vaswani

INTRODUCTION
Shock is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in
children. Early recognition of shock and prompt intervention
remains the cornerstone of intact survival. The objective of this
chapter is:
• Early recognition of shock, by evaluating clinical signs of
systemic perfusion and compensation
• To ascertain the type of shock: hypovolemic, distributive,
cardiogenic, or obstructive.
• To assess the severity of shock, whether compensated or
hypotensive

DEFINITION
Shock is a critical condition that results from inadequate tissue
delivery of oxygen and nutrients to meet tissue metabolic
demand, often, but not always characterized by inadequate
peripheral and end-organ perfusion.
Lactic acid and waste products accumulate in the tissues
as a result of anaerobic metabolism when oxygen delivery is
compromised and a vicious cycle sets in as illustrated in the
figure 1 below.

RECOGNITION OF SHOCK
For prompt and proper management of ill children, it is
important to recognize:
• Shock is present
• Type of shock
• Severity of shock.

Recognizing Shock
Simple clinical evaluation of airway, breathing, circulation,
disability, exposure (ABCDE) of a patient gives sufficient clues
to recognition of shock and also type and severity of shock.
• Respiratory rate, effort, and sounds: tachypnea, a breathing
rate that is more rapid than normal for age with or without
signs of increased work of breathing, decreased air entry,
asymmetrical chest rise, and crackles (crepitations), need
to be looked for, along with pulse oximetry
• Heart rate and pulse quality: tachycardia is a resting
heart rate that is faster than the normal range for a child’s
age. Tachycardia is body’s first response and the main
compensatory mechanism especially in infants.

Clinical Pearl
• Tachycardia should not be ignored though it does not always
indicate shock.

Evaluation of pulses, both central and peripheral, gives vital
information regarding perfusion (Table 1). Vasoconstriction

results in weak peripheral pulses while a low systemic vascular
resistance (SVR) and increased blood flow to the skin in
distributive shock results in bounding pulses.
Bradycardia, weak central pulses are relatively late features
and sinister signs implying exhaustion of physiological
compensatory mechanisms.
• Systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure: systolic blood
pressure measured appropriately helps in assessing the
severity of shock. It is important to realize that a normal or
low systolic pressure is not a criterion to recognize shock.
An observed decrease in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm
Hg from baseline should prompt to evaluate further and
identify shock
• Pulse-pressure: vasoconstriction manifests as narrow
pulse pressure, less than 25% of systolic pressure in cold
shock and a low SVR as wide-pulse pressure
• End-organ perfusion
{{ Brain: level of consciousness is assessed on AVPU scale
–– A- Alert
–– V- Responsive to voice
–– P- Responsive to pain
–– U- Unresponsive
Pupillary size and response to light, muscle tone,
and seizures give vital clues to cerebral and brain-stem
perfusion and function.
{{ Skin: skin perfusion is assessed by examining three
parameters—color, refill time, and temperature of skin
(CRT)
–– Color: look for changes in skin color, pallor,
cyanosis and, mottling (an irregular and patchy
discoloration of skin)
–– Refill time: capillary refill time (CRT) is the time
it takes for blood to return to tissue blanched
by pressure. It increases in a neutral thermal
environment, as skin perfusion decreases. Normal
CRT is less than 2 seconds. It may be very rapid,
flash, as in warm shock

An increase in the output reflects improved kidney
perfusion. It is important to remember that initial urine
output is not a reliable indicator of present status.
• Exposure: exposing one area at a time, avoiding discomfort
and hypothermia, look for core temperature, fever and,
evidence of trauma, burns, petechiae, purpura, rashes of
“allergy”, acute surgical emergencies like acute abdomen,
torsion of testis (including one in an undescended testis),
and poisoning.
A focused medical history, easy to recall by the mnemonic
SAMPLE (Signs and symptoms, Allergies, Medicines given,
Past medical history, Last meal, Events leading to the present
illness) gives valuable information regarding the cause or
other comorbid conditions to help tailor intervention strategy.
For example, history of diarrhea, trauma, known allergies to
food or medicines, premature birth, recent travel, a known
case of congenital heart disease or arrhythmias, seizures,
neuromuscular disease, diabetes, renal disease, or last
menstrual period in an adolescent girl, can help identify the
type of shock or need to modify drugs or dosages.
Certain laboratory tests can be crucial in recognition
and management of shock. These include rapid bedside
glucose, arterial blood gas, venous blood gas, hemoglobin
concentration, arterial lactate, central venous or invasive
arterial pressure monitoring, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram,
echocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasound.

TYPES
Shock can be categorized into four basic types:
1 Hypovolemic
2 Distributive
3 Cardiogenic
4 Obstructive.
Shock can result from a variety of clinical causes, like
decreased blood volume resulting from blood or fluid loss,
cardiac-pump dysfunction, maldistribution of blood as in sepsis
or anaphylaxis, and/or physical obstruction to blood flow.

Clinical Pearl
• Though a sluggish (color, refill time, and temperature of skin)
may be a feature of shock, a normal or rapid CRT does not rule
out shock. A rising fever or a cold environment will result in a
prolonged CRT.

{{

Ch-31.indd 136

–– Temperature: skin temperature should be normal
and consistent over the trunk and extremities.
With decreased skin perfusion, skin becomes cool,
hands and feet getting affected first. A temperature
difference between “toe and tummy” indicates
decreased perfusion. As the condition worsens,
even trunk temperature drops. Temperature of
skin also helps in monitoring improvement, as
perfusion improves the line of demarcation moves
distally
Kidneys: urine output is a simple and essential para­
meter to assess kidney perfusion. Children with shock
have decreased urine output, less than 1 mL/kg/hr.

Clinical Pearls
• Hypovolemic shock is characterized by “quiet tachypnea”
• Increased respiratory effort distinguishes cardiogenic from
hypovolemic shock
• Children with cardiogenic shock may demonstrate retractions,
grunting, and use of accessory muscles.
• Treatment of obstructive shock is cause-specific; however, the
most critical task is prompt recognition
• Without early recognition and immediate treatment,
obstructive shock rapidly progresses to cardiopulmonary
failure and cardiac arrest.

SEVERITY
Compensated and Hypotensive Shock
Compensated shock is characterized by maintenance of
systolic blood pressure within the normal range with signs of

11/19/2016 1:41:33 PM

Chapter 31: Recognition of Child in Shock

and age

inadequate tissue perfusion. The compensatory mechanisms
try to maintain blood flow to the heart and brain, when oxygen
delivery is limited.
Hypotensive shock represents failure or exhaustion of
physiological responses to maintain systolic blood pressure
and perfusion, that is, hypotension with poor perfusion. It is a
late finding in most types of shocks and may signal impending
cardiac arrest but can occur early in septic shock as a result of
vasodilation by mediators.
Hypotension is defined by systolic blood pressure and age
(Table 2).

 Algorithm 1
Recognition of shock

Though different types of shock are shown in this algorithm, it is impotant to realize that a given child may not present with any of these in isolation. One type of shock
may progress to another type as condition progresses, as has been illustrated in tables 3 and 4.
RR, respiratory rate; HR, heart rate; CRT, capillary refill time; BP, blood pressure; DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis; CHF, congestive heat failure

It is important to realize that these threshold values were
established in normal, resting children; and children with
injury or serious illness would have increased blood pressure.
So a low-normal range is abnormal in a seriously ill child.
At times, with poor perfusion and feeble distal pulse and
cool extremities, blood pressure recording may not be feasible.
Change in the level of consciousness, progressive tachypnea,
and tachycardia indicate worsening status. Bradycardia and
weak central pulses in a child with signs of shock are signs of
impending cardiac arrest.
It is crucial to recognize the shock in the compensated
stage and manage promptly. Though shock progression
is un­
predictable, it may take hours to deteriorate from
compensated to hypotensive shock but only minutes for
hypo­tensive shock to end up in cardiopulmonary failure and
cardiac arrest.

Clinical Pearl
• Shock can be categorized but not diagnosed by blood pressure.

Shock can be categorised but not identified or defined by
blood pressure.

Key points

))
The presence of shock and the type of shock can be
recognized by simple, systematic clinical examination

))
Shock can exist and should be diagnosed even in the presence
of normal blood pressure; the presence of hypotension only
helps to categorize the severity of shock
))
It is crucial to recognize shock before hypotension develops,
so that prompt treatment can be instituted
))
Majority of patients presenting to us in shock have, fortunately,
“normal” blood pressure, giving us a window period to revive
them
))
Tachycardia should not be ignored; though it does not always
indicate shock
))
In acute illnesses, cold extremities demand prompt action.

Croup

Bhavesh M Mithiya

INTRODUCTION
Croup is a common, primarily pediatric viral respiratory
tract illness. As its alternative names (laryngotracheitis/
laryngotracheobronchitis) indicate, croup generally affects the
larynx and trachea with the maximal narrowing occurring in
the upper, extrathoracic trachea, although this illness may also
extend to the bronchi.
It is the most common etiology for hoarseness, cough,
and onset of acute stridor in febrile children. As with all viral
infections, the severity ranges widely, with the vast majority
recovering without consequences or sequelae; however, it can
be life threatening.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Stridor is common and this abnormal sound alarms
parents enough to visit healthcare facility.
Stridor is an audible harsh, high-pitched sound produced
by turbulent airflow through a partially obstructed upper
airway (at the level of supraglottis, glottis, subglottis, and/or
trachea).
During inspiration, airways that are easily collapsible (e.g.,
supraglottic region) are suctioned closed because of negative
intraluminal pressure and are forced open during expiration.
Stridor can be heard in inspiration, expiration, or it can be
biphasic (inspiratory and expiratory).
Inspiratory stridor suggests a laryngeal obstruction,
whereas expiratory stridor suggests tracheobronchial obstruc­
tion. Biphasic stridor indicates either a subglottic or glottic
anomaly.

It is most common in monsoon and early winter but may occur
at any time of year. It is commonly seen in age group of 1–3
years, with peak during 2nd year of life. Boys are more affected
than girls (2:1). Around 15% of children experience at least one
episode, and 5% of children experience more than one episode.

ETIOLOGY
Parainfluenza viruses are the most common amongst all
viruses, responsible for as many as 80% of croup cases, though
it can be caused by many other viruses.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Croup begins with nonspecific respiratory symptoms, like
rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and generally low grade fever
(38–39°C); however in next 1–2 days, the characteristic signs
of hoarseness, barking cough, and inspiratory stridor develop,
often suddenly, along with a variable degree of respiratory
distress. “Absence of drooling of saliva” clinically confirms
presence of edema below the glottic area (which differentiates
croup from supraglottic causes like epiglottis/retropharyngeal
abscess) (Figs 1 to 3).

Section 4: Office Emergencies

SEVERITY OF CROUP
While most have only “barking” cough and hoarse cry, few
have stridor on activity/agitation, and very few have audible
stridor at rest with respiratory distress. Paradoxically, a severely
affected child may have “quiet” stridor secondary to a greater
degree of airway obstruction.
Various croup scores have been developed to assess the
degree of respiratory compromise, but for practical purposes,
it can be divided into mild, moderate, and severe disease.
A clinically useful croup severity assessment table has been
developed by the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline Working
Group (Table 1).

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Fig. 2: Croup: inflammatory edema below the glottic area (subglottic
edema)

Though certain conditions like congenital structural
malformations can present with stridor, they are not acute.
When a child presents with acute stridor, one needs to
differentiate retropharyngeal (RP) abscess/epiglottitis from
acute laryngotracheobronchitis (ALTB) by the presence of
drooling of saliva in the former. Recurrent stridor is usually
allergic and may occasionally be due to gastroesophageal
reflux (GER).

INVESTIGATIONS

Fig. 3: Epiglottitis: inflammatory edema above the glottic area
(supraglottic edema)

An acute onset of marked inspiratory stridor is one of the
hallmarks of croup. The child with croup typically does not
appear toxic.

Clinical Pearls

140

Ch-32.indd 140

Upper airway obstruction
• Interferes mainly with inspiration
• Inspiratory stridor
• Severe retractions
• Croupy/brassy cough
Lower airway obstruction
• Interferes mainly with expiration
• Expiratory wheeze
• Mild retractions + prolonged expiration
• Repetitive cough.

Croup is essentially a clinical diagnosis, based on presenting
history/physical examination, and investigations rarely
contribute. The complete blood count (CBC) is nonspecific.
Identifying the specific viral etiology is typically not
necessary and also not available to most.
Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements are unnecessary
(unless respiratory fatigue), in fact it may worsen the airway
obstruction due to excessive crying.
Typically X-ray is not needed to confirm the diagnosis of
croup, and if at all, it is done to exclude other causes mimicking
croup such as a radio-opaque foreign body, or an RP abscess.
If done, X-ray (AP) of the soft tissues of the neck classically
reveals a steeple sign (also known as a pencil-point sign),

which signifies subglottic narrowing, whereas the lateral neck
view may reveal a distended hypopharynx (ballooning) during
inspiration (see the images below) (Figs 4 and 5). However,
these findings may not be seen in upto 50% cases.
A steeple sign may also be observed in patients without
croup, such as epiglottitis, thermal injury, angioedema, or
bacterial tracheitis.
Laryngoscopy and/or bronchoscopy are indicated only in
unusual circumstances (e.g., the course of illness is not typical
or recurrent croup to rule out an underlying anatomic or
congenital disorder).

TREATMENT
The current cornerstones of treatment are corticosteroids and
nebulized epinephrine.
• Nebulized epinephrine (adrenaline):
{{ It is used for children with moderate-to-severe respira­
tory distress. Effectiveness of standard epinephrine
1:1,000 (which is available in India) is the same as
racemic epinephrine, when given in dose of 0.5 mL/kg
(maximum 5 mL)
{{ Epinephrine stimulates α- and β2-receptors causing
constrictions of precapillary arterioles thereby
decreasing capillary hydrostatic pressure which
leads to fluid resorption from the interstitium, thus
decreasing airway edema
{{ Its effectiveness is immediate with evidence of
therapeutic benefit within the first 30 minutes and
then, lasts from 1.5 hours to 2 hours; hence after
nebulized epinephrine, patient should be observed for
at least 3 hours to monitor for a rebound worsening.
Patients can be discharged home if they demonstrate
good color, adequate air entry, baseline consciousness,
and no stridor at rest and have received a dose of
corticosteroids
• Corticosteroids: they act through anti-inflammatory action,
whereby decreasing mucosal edema and also decreasing
the need for nebulized epinephrine. It may be warranted
even in those children who present with mild symptoms.
In moderate to severe disease, it improves croup scores
within 12–24 hours and decrease hospitalization rates. All
different routes of administration (oral/IM/nebulized) are
shown to be efficacious
{{ Dexamethasone: a single dose of dexamethasone has
been shown to be effective in reducing the overall
severity of croup, if used within the first 4–24 hours
of onset. Most trials have used dexamethasone IM or
oral (with equal efficacy) at 0.6 mg/kg/dose (with a
maximum daily dose of 10 mg). It is 6.67 times potent
than prednisone and has a long half-life of 36–56 hours.
Also, patients treated with single dose of prednisolone
(1 mg/kg) were found to require more follow-up visits
than with dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg)
–– Even though dexamethasone dosed at 0.15 mg/kg
is as effective as 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg, still dose
of 0.6 mg/kg is advocated as it is more effective for
patients diagnosed with severe croup and remains
optimal for safety and benefit
{{ Inhaled budesonide:
–– It has been shown in several studies to be equi­
valent to oral dexamethasone. Dose is 2–4 mg.
Using inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide) along
with systemic steroid does not provide additional
benefit
–– Usage of steroids has no significant adverse effects;
however, it should be carefully evaluated for children
with diabetes/immunocompromised state, recently
diagnosed with varicella or tuberculosis. Urgent care
of croup depends on the degree of severity

Cool-mist therapy: Randomized studies with moderate-tosevere croup revealed no difference in outcome
Antibiotics are not needed, as etiology is viral infection
Heliox:Currently, the evidence is not sufficient to
establish the beneficial effect of heliox in pediatric croup
management (Table 2).

COMPLICATIONS
Complications in croup are rare. In most series, less than 5%
of children needed hospitalization and less than 2% of those
who were hospitalized were intubated. Death occurred in
approximately 0.5% of intubated patients.
A secondary bacterial infection may rarely result in
pneumonia or bacterial tracheitis, a life-threatening infection.
This manifests as, mild-to-moderate illness for 2–7 days,
followed by severe symptoms with toxic appearance and does
not respond well to nebulized epinephrine.

Pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, lymphadenitis, and
otitis media have also been reported in croup. Poor ability to
maintain adequate oral intake plus increased insensible fluid
losses can lead to dehydration.

PROGNOSIS
The prognosis for croup is excellent, and recovery is usually
complete. The majority of patients are managed successfully as
outpatients, without the need for hospitalization.

SPASMODIC CROUP
Spasmodic croup (laryngismus stridulus) may be a non­
infectious variant of the disorder, with a clinical presentation
similar to that of the acute disease but with less coryza.
In spasmodic croup, subglottic edema occurs without the
inflammation typical in viral disease.

Chapter 32: Croup
Spasmodic croup (recurrent croup) typically presents at
night with the sudden onset of “croupy” cough and stridor. The
child may have had mild upper respiratory complaints prior
to this, but more often has behaved and appeared completely
well prior to the onset of symptoms.
Allergic factors may cause recurrent croup, due to the
patient becoming sensitized to viral antigens. Another
diagnostic consideration is GER. Studies of children presenting
with recurrent croup have reported relief of their respiratory
symptoms when treated for reflux.

Key points

))
It is a viral (parainfluenza) infection with subglottic airway
obstruction, in age 1–3 years

))

Approach to a Child with
Acute Febrile Encephalopathy
Surpreet BS Nagi

INTRODUCTION
A child presenting with fever and altered sensorium is a common
pediatric emergency. Acute febrile encephalopathy (AFE) is a
clinical term used to describe an altered mental state that either
accompanies or follows a short febrile illness and is characterized
by a diffuse and nonspecific brain insult manifested by a
combination of coma, seizures, and/or decerebration.
Encephalopathy is a diffuse disease affecting the brain that
alters its structure or function and may be caused due to diverse
etiology like infective, metabolic, toxic, ischemic, nutritional
causes or trauma. In febrile illnesses, encephalopathy may
result from pathogenic mechanisms affecting the nervous
system directly or systemic complications like hypoglycemia,
hypovolemia, hyperpyrexia, hypoxia, anemia, hepatic or renal
failure, toxins, vasculitis, and bleeding.
Central nervous system (CNS) infections are the most
common cause of AFE in children. Various causes such as viral
encephalitis, cerebral malaria, bacterial meningitis, Reye’s
syndrome, and inflammatory encephalopathies including
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), etc. have been
implicated in the etiology; and the proportionate contribution
of each varies according to the geographical area. In tropical
countries like India, cerebral malaria, Japanese encephalitis
(JE), herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), and bacterial
meningitis are the common causes of AFE, while tuberculous
meningitis (TBM) usually presents with a subacute or chronic
history. Even after a detailed diagnostic workup, one may not be
able to arrive at a definitive diagnosis in many cases. Neverthe­
less, a detailed examination and workup is warranted, because
many conditions like cerebral malaria and HSE are treatable.

SOME DEFINITIONS
Encephalopathy
Encephalopathy describes a clinical syndrome of altered
mental status, manifesting as reduced consciousness or altered
behavior, without any inflammation of the brain.

Ch-33.indd 144

Acute Febrile Encephalopathy
Acute febrile encephalopathy is a clinical diagnosis and is
described as a syndrome of altered sensorium associated with
fever of less than 1 week duration, and altered consciousness
of more than 12-hours duration, with or without seizures in a
previously normal child.

Encephalitis
Encephalitis means inflammation of the brain. It is strictly a
pathological diagnosis; but surrogate clinical/imaging markers
may provide evidence of inflammation.

Acute Encephalitis Syndrome
Clinically, a case of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is
defined as a person of any age, at any time of year with the
acute onset of fever and a change in mental status (including
symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, coma, or inability
to talk) and/or new onset of seizures (excluding simple febrile
seizures). Other early clinical findings may include an increase
in irritability, somnolence, or abnormal behavior greater than
that seen with usual febrile illness.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The pathophysiology of AFE usually is multifactorial and varies
according to the etiology. Encephalopathy generally results
from cytotoxic injury or disruption of neurotransmission.
However, the final pathway is common, which is interruption
of the polysynaptic pathways and altered excitatory-inhibitory
amino acid balance, leading to cerebral edema. All forms
of acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy interfere with the
function of the ascending reticular activating system and/or its
projections to the cerebral cortex, thus leading to impairment
of arousal and/or awareness, and/or seizures. Despite a
wide array of pathophysiologic mechanisms, the clinical
manifestations tend to be very similar because of the common
final mechanism.

Chapter 33: Approach to a Child with Acute Febrile Encephalopathy

ETIOLOGY
The etiology of AFE varies from infectious etiologies to
noninfectious metabolic disorders (Table 1). The following are
some of the common causes of AFE:
• Infections:
{{ Meningoencephalitis: due to viruses like herpes
simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, human herpes virus
6, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella zoster virus,
cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, influenza, enterovirus,
poliovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, dengue
virus, chikungunya, arboviruses (JE, West Nile virus),
and retrovirus [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]
{{ Bacterial infections like pyogenic meningitis, and
other organisms like Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Listeria, Borrelia burgdorferi
(Lyme disease), Leptospira, Brucella, and Salmonella
typhi
{{ Rickettsial infections, fungal infections due to crypto­
coccosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and
candidiasis

EVALUATION
Patients presenting with an AFE can be broadly divided into
three categories (Table 2).
A detailed history and physical examination is essential to
categorize the patient into one of these groups. At the outset,
it is important to differentiate infective from non-infective
causes, because infection mandates prompt antimicrobial
therapy. There are no distinguishing clinical or radiological
features to differentiate the various causes of viral encephalitis.
The clinical and the radiological findings in encephalitis should
be interpreted in the geographical and other epidemiological
background.

APPROACH TO ACUTE FEBRILE
ENCEPHALOPATHY (ALGORITHM 1)
Step 1: Initiate Resuscitation and Assess
Neurological Status
As in any emergency, one needs to quickly evaluate the
airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC’s). It is during this
assessment that alteration of sensorium is first recognized
(or confirmed). Initial neurological examination includes only
a survey of vital signs, including respiratory patterns, Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupillary response, and extraocular
muscle examination. The common goal in the treatment of a
patient with encephalopathy is to prevent secondary injury
by maintaining oxygen delivery and supply of nutrients to the
brain. Thus, the ABC’s of basic life support supersede all other
interventions.
If the initial assessment suggests that the child is unstable,
then the management priorities should be directed to ensuring

adequacy of airway, breathing, and circulatory function,
irrespective of the etiology. Depending on the degree of
instability, this initial management may actually precede the
assessment of the degree of impairment of consciousness;
though usually, both are carried out nearly simultaneously.
The depth of coma can be assessed by the GCS or the AVPU
scale (Wherein A-Alert, V-Response to Voice, P-Response to
Pain and U-Unresponsive). A modified GCS should be used
for infants and young children. In case of any confusion about
the assessment, it is preferable to err on the side of recording a
lower score initially, since it is easier to withdraw treatment in
a child who is improving, rather than to resuscitate a child who
is deteriorating.
Assessment of the airway and need for intubation is
of paramount importance as the children with impaired
consciousness are at a high risk for aspiration (Box 1). These
children have loss of tone of the oropharyngeal muscles
causing the tongue to fall back and obstruct the airway, and
pooling of secretions (leading to aspiration). Measures should
be taken to secure the airway. If the child shows signs of
airway obstruction, repositioning of the head with the chin lift
maneuver may alleviate the obstruction. If cervical spine injury
is suspected, a jaw thrust maneuver is preferable and the neck
immobilized while securing the airway. An oral airway may be
inserted if required and secretions cleared using a large-boresuction cannula.
Once the airway patency has been established, the
adequacy of breathing should be evaluated. Auscultation of
the lung fields should assess for air entry, symmetry of breath
sounds, and presence of adventitious breath sounds such as
crackles or wheezes. Pulse oximetry can be used to evaluate
oxygenation. Oxygen should be administered to all seriouslyill children via non-rebreathing face mask. Adequacy of
ventilation should be assessed by examination and arterial
blood gases. If the airway is patent but the child’s respiratory
effort is deemed inadequate, positive pressure ventilation
should be initiated. The airway interventions should be
instituted as nontraumatically as possible, as they may
cause spikes in intracranial pressure (ICP). Rapid-sequence
intubation is preferred. Moderate hyperventilation (target
PaCO2 30–35 mmHg) to produce arterial constriction and
lower ICP should only be initiated for patients with signs of
increased ICP. Extreme hyperventilation has been associated
with brain ischemia; the risks of aggressive hyperventilation

(PaCO2 <30 mmHg) are only justified in patients with
transtentorial herniation.
Attempt should be made to maintain the cerebral
perfusion pressure (CPP), which is the major factor that
affects cerebral blood flow and hence, adequate oxygenation.
Cerebral perfusion pressure depends on the mean arterial
pressure (MAP) and the ICP (CPP = MAP − ICP). Cerebral
perfusion pressure can reduce as a result of reduced MAP or
raised ICP or a combination of these two. Therefore, adequate
MAP should be maintained. If the ICP rises, the blood pressure
(BP) rises as a compensatory phenomenon in order to try and
maintain the cerebral perfusion. However, there is a limit to
such compensation, beyond which the cerebral perfusion
may suffer. Cerebral ischemia is the single-most important
determinant that decides the outcome of such patients.
Once the airway and breathing have been addressed,
circulation must be evaluated. This involves assessment of
the cardiac output. Symptoms of shock include tachycardia,
cool extremities, delayed capillary refill time, mottled or pale
skin, and effortless tachypnea. Hypotension is a late finding in
shock. Vascular access is necessary for volume resuscitation
in patients with impaired circulation. While establishing an
intravenous access, samples should be drawn for various
investigations. If there is evidence of circulatory failure, fluid
bolus (20 mL/kg of normal saline; maximum 60 mL/kg)
should be administered. If there is evidence of septic shock,
larger volumes (60–80 mL/kg) may be needed to correct the
shock. Once an intervention is performed, the clinician must
reassess the patient. Raised ICP is not a contraindication for
fluid administration for the correction of shock. Effective
circulation through intravenous isotonic fluid administration
and inotropes, if necessary, is essential to deliver oxygen
and metabolic substrates to the brain and remove toxic
metabolites. Hypotonic fluids like 5% or 10% dextrose can lead
to cerebral edema in children with raised ICP and should not
be administered. Aim should be to maintain the BP at around
the 95th percentile in order to maintain CPP in the face of an
elevated ICP.
Raised ICP is a common cause of death in children with
AFE. It is important to recognize and promptly manage signs
of raised ICP (Box 2). A common mistake in the emergency
departments is to mistake decerebrate posturing for seizures,
and inappropriately treat with antiepileptic drugs. Almost
all cases of non-traumatic coma have an element of raised
ICP. Signs of raised ICP should be picked up early. A careful
examination of the fundus is mandatory in all children with

altered sensorium. Acute elevation of ICP will not cause
papilledema in the acute stages. Hence, its absence must
not be taken as a reassuring sign. Neither, will a computed
tomography (CT) pick up raised ICP in the acute stage.
If there are features of raised ICP, measures to decrease
ICP should be rapidly instituted. Early interventions to reduce
ICP include treating fever, maintaining the head in the midline
with an elevation of 15–30° above the horizontal and moderate
hyperventilation (target PaCO2 30–35 mmHg). Mannitol
should be given in a dose of 0.25–0.5 g/kg intravenously over
15 minutes, and repeated every 4–6 hourly; only if required.
It should not be administered round the clock and is unlikely
to be effective after 48–72 hours. Furosemide is often used in
conjunction with mannitol. Hypertonic saline (3%) may be
preferred in hypotensive or hypoperfused patients for reducing
the ICP while maintaining the MAP and CPP. A neurosurgical
consultation should be asked for.

case of refractory seizures. Subtle seizures (NCSE) should
be identified and treated appropriately, as unrecognized
seizure activity increases the ICP and could precipitate
herniation. Non convulsive status epilepticus manifests, as
an abnormal and fluctuating impairment of consciousness,
diminished responsiveness; and may be picked up on an
electroencephalogram (EEG), and often showing a delayed
response (4–5 days in some patients) to anticonvulsant
medications.
Agitation may increase ICP, interfere with respiratory
support, and increase the risk of injury. Efforts should be
taken to provide pain relief and sedation during painful
procedures. Significant sedation, however, may obscure the
neurologic examination, may contribute to hypotension and
hypoventilation, and should be administered only when the
benefits of relieving agitation outweigh the need for close
neurologic monitoring by examination.

Clinical Pearls

Key points

• Airway, breathing and circulation of basic life support
supersede all other interventions
• Initial management may actually precede the assessment of the
degree of impairment of consciousness in an unstable child
• Preferable to record a lower glasgow coma scale score initially
• Airway interventions should be instituted as nontraumatically
as possible
• Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure
• Reassess after every intervention
• Almost all cases of nontraumatic coma have an element of
raised intracranial pressure
• Normal fundus or normal neuroimaging does not rule out a
raised intracranial pressure.

Treatment of associated conditions is of paramount
importance. Normothermia should be maintained. The use
of therapeutic hypothermia (32–34°C) may be appropriate
for children with out-of-hospital arrest and persistent coma
or those with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular
tachycardia. Acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities should
be corrected.
If hypoglycemia is present, intravenous glucose bolus
should be administered. In a neonate, 2 mL/kg of 10%
IV dextrose bolus; and in an older child 5 mL/kg of 10%
IV dextrose bolus should be given. Thereafter, the sugar
levels should be monitored and the glucose infusion rates
modified accordingly. Hyperglycemia resulting from stress is
a more common finding in these conditions. Hypoglycemia
damages the brain immediately and needs urgent correction.
Hyperglycemia, on the other hand, is associated with a higher
morbidity and mortality if not treated; and hence tight glycemic
control should be the aim.
If the child is having seizures, or there is history of a seizure
preceding the encephalopathy, anticonvulsants (intravenous
benzodiazepine followed by phenytoin loading 20 mg/kg or
fosphenytoin) should be administered. The standard protocol
for the management of status epilepticus may be followed in

History (Table 3)
The patient’s history may hold the most important and
sometimes the only clue to a correct diagnosis. A careful
history should be taken with special emphasis on the onset and
duration of encephalopathy and the type and degree of fever.
The child, who has been apparently well prior to the onset of
encephalopathy and has an acute onset of illness, may have
suffered from poisonings, drug overdose, metabolic disorders
or child abuse, as the probable causes. Central nervous system
infections, on the other hand, would present with complaints
evolving over a few days associated with a history of fever or
recent illness. Disorders in which encephalopathy may be

preceded by a febrile illness include ADEM, Reye’s syndrome,
mitochondrial and other inborn errors of metabolism.
The associated symptoms may indicate the focus of
infection. Symptoms such as headache, nausea and vomiting,
irritability, seizures, focal deficits, rash, and joint pain
should be enquired into in depth. Other concurrent systemic
illnesses, e.g., jaundice (hepatic failure), pneumonia (hypoxic
encephalopathy), diarrhea (dyselectrolytemia), and dysentery
(shigella encephalopathy) need to be elicited in the history.
Nonaccidental trauma should always be considered in a
lethargic infant.
Other history which may offer some aid in the diagnosis:
• History of trauma, recent illness, or surgery (splenectomy,
neurosurgery)
• Family history of seizure disorders or previous child deaths
• Comorbid conditions like congenital heart disease,
diabetes, chronic liver, or renal diseases
• Premorbid developmental or neurological status of the
child
• Immunosuppressive states (HIV), chemotherapy, and
prolonged steroids.

Examination

children. The degree of fever, the presence of tachycardia outof-proportion to the fever, and the presence of tachypnea and
hypotension, when present, are ominous signs.
The presence of fever suggests an infective process (sepsis,
pneumonia, meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess); but
may also indicate heat stroke or abnormality of hypothalamic
temperature regulatory mechanisms. Tachycardia may be a
result of fever, hypovolemic or septic shock, heart failure, or
arrhythmias. Bradycardia may result from raised ICP or a result
of myocardial injury (myocarditis, hypoxia, sepsis, or toxins).
Tachypnea with respiratory distress indicates lung pathology
(pneumonia, pneumothorax, empyema, or asthma). Quiet
tachypnea is indicative of acidosis which may be present in
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), uremia, or some poisonings.
Hypotension may be seen in sepsis, cardiac dysfunction,
toxic ingestion, or adrenal insufficiency, and may lead to
poor cerebral perfusion, resulting in diffuse or watershed
hypoxic-ischemic injury. Hypertension may be the cause of
altered sensorium in hypertensive encephalopathy or may be
a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral perfusion in
children with increased ICP or stroke.
A thorough systemic examination should be performed
to look for a source of sepsis. Systemic examination must be
performed to look for hepatosplenomegaly (infections or
liver disease), pulmonary involvement such as pneumonia,
pleural effusions, and empyema, skin and bone lesions and
cardiac involvement such as myocarditis or a pre-existing
congenital or rheumatic heart disease (which may predispose
to endocarditis and subsequently intracranial abscess).

Section 4: Office Emergencies

Detailed neurological examination
The neurological examination is targeted to document
the level and localization of brain dysfunction. It may
also provide information about the potential causes. This
includes assessment of the level of consciousness, patterns
of respiration, and signs of meningeal irritation, fundus and
pupillary examination, signs of cranial nerve involvement,
presence of focal deficits, signs of raised ICP, brainstem signs
and autonomic signs.
The level of consciousness must be recorded in the form of
an objective scale, such as the GCS or the AVPU score. While
the GCS allows efficient, standardized communication of a
child’s state, a more detailed description of the child’s clinical
findings is often more useful for relaying detailed information
and detecting changes over time.
Respiratory pattern abnormalities signify either a metabolic
derangement or a neurological insult (Table 5).

Pupils
Pupillary size, shape, symmetry, and response to light provide
valuable clues to brainstem and third nerve dysfunction. The
presence or absence of the pupillary reaction to light is one
of the most important differentiating features to distinguish
between structural and metabolic disorders as metabolic
disturbances affect the pupillary pathways late. Usually in
metabolic disorders leading to altered level of consciousness,
pupils remain reactive in the initial stages. But in structural
disorders with increased ICP, signs of herniation syndrome
will appear. Topical administration of mydriatics must
be avoided, but if done, should be documented to avoid
confusion in interpretation. Abnormalities of eye position
and movement may provide some clues. Conjugate
lateral deviation of the eyes is a sign either of an ipsilateral
hemisphere lesion, a contralateral hemisphere seizure focus,
or damage involving the contralateral pontine horizontal
gaze center (parapontine reticular formation). Lateral gaze
palsy may signal central herniation with compression of
bilateral sixth nerves. Tonic upward gaze has been associated
with bilateral hemispheric damage.

The presence of oculocephalic (doll’s eye), oculovestibular,
corneal, cough, and gag reflexes must be looked for to check
for brainstem function. Brainstem dysfunction is an important
feature in some causes of viral encephalitis such as enterovirus
71, mumps, and rabies and in all causes when the ICP has risen
progressively.
Fundus examination must be performed to look for
papilledema and retinal hemorrhages. Retinal hemorrhages
are an important clue for cerebral malaria in endemic setting,
being present in nearly a quarter of the patients.

Clinical Pearl
• Unilateral pupillary dilatation in the comatose patient should
be considered as evidence of oculomotor nerve compression
from ipsilateral uncal herniation, unless proved otherwise.

Motor examination (Table 6)
Assessment of muscle strength, tone, and tendon reflexes
should be done for normality and symmetry. The trunk,
limb position, spontaneous movements, and response to
stimulation must be observed to look for any focal deficits
(suggestive of postictal Todd’s palsy or structural abnormality),
and posturing (decerebrate or decorticate).
Special attention should be given to posturing because it
often signals a brainstem herniation syndrome.
• Decorticate posturing: Flexion of upper limbs and
extension of the lower limbs. It suggests involvement of the
cerebral cortex and preservation of brainstem function
• Decerebrate posturing: Rigid extension of both arms and
legs indicative of cortical and brainstem dysfunction
• Opisthotonus: Neck is hyperextended and the teeth are
clenched; the arms are adducted and hyperextended; and
the legs are extended with feet plantar flexed. It indicates
severe brainstem dysfunction
• The flaccid patient with no response to painful stimuli
indicates deep brainstem dysfunction
• Monoplegia or hemiplegia, except when in postictal phase,
suggests a structural disturbance of the contralateral
hemisphere (herniation across falx).

Presence of signs of meningeal irritation (neck rigidity,
Kernig’s sign, and Brudzinski’s sign) must be looked for.
Kernig’s sign involves flexion of the hip to 90° with subsequent
pain on extension of the leg; Brudzinski’s sign involves
involuntary flexion of the knees and hips after passive flexion
of the neck while supine. In younger children, Kernig’s and
Brudzinski’s signs are not consistently present; especially with
an open fontanel. Signs of meningeal irritation may be present
in meningitis, encephalitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Neck rigidity is present in meningitis, tonsillar herniation, or
craniocervical trauma.
The commonly seen focal signs are hemiparesis, ataxia,
aphasia, pyramidal signs, and involuntary movements
(myoclonus, dystonia, tremors). Cranial neuropathies of the
ocular, oculomotor, abducens, facial, and auditory nerve
should be looked for.
Signs of increased intracranial tension in children range
from headache, vomiting to herniation. It is best to suspect
raised ICP and start treating it, on clinical grounds alone. Raised
ICP, when untreated, can also lead to herniation of the brain,
which causes direct mechanical damage as well as ischemia
and hemorrhage secondary to vascular distortion. Brain tissue
deforms intracranially and moves from higher to lower pressure
when there is asymmetric, unilateral, or generalized increased
ICP. This gives rise to the various herniation syndromes. These
syndromes, in this order (from higher to lower pressures),
signify a progression in severity. Changes from one syndrome
to the next, signifies progressive worsening.

Ch-33.indd 151

The various herniation syndromes can be recognized
clinically. The importance lies in recognition and prompt
treatment, before the damage becomes irreversible. Treatment
of herniation involves removal of the etiologic mass and
surgical decompression in the form of external ventricular
drainage and hemicraniectomy may be indicated (Table 7).

Step 3: Send Basic Investigations
Basic Investigations
Basic workup like complete blood count with platelet count,
peripheral smear, blood culture, blood glucose, liver and renal
profile, coagulation parameters, and electrolytes should be
obtained in all patients presenting with an AFE. An arterial
blood gas, chest X-ray, serum ammonia, and serum lactate
should be sent if required.
All patients with febrile encephalopathy should undergo
blood cultures. Relative lymphocytosis in the peripheral
blood is common in viral encephalitis. Leukopenia and
thrombocytopenia are noted in viral hemorrhagic fevers and
rickettsial infections. Typhoid fever and cerebral malaria may
be associated with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia.

151

11/19/2016 1:50:52 PM

Section 4: Office Emergencies
Hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance are usually associated
with CNS infection and they may contribute to altered
sensorium. Serum creatinine and blood urea are helpful to
assess the renal function and serum bilirubin, transaminases
and prothrombin time are indicated if jaundice is present.
An X-ray chest may show changes suggestive of tuberculosis,
mycoplasma, or legionellosis.
In endemic areas, look for malaria (peripheral smear
and rapid detection tests), dengue (serology and NS1 Ag),
Leptospira (antibody tests), enteric fever (blood culture),
typhus (antibody test), and JE (antibody in serum and CSF) as
the probable etiology.

Lumbar Puncture
Urgent evaluation of CSF is required when there is a suspected
infection of the CNS; provided the patient is hemodynamically
stable, and has no features of raised ICP. A lumbar puncture
is recommended in all patients with suspected CNS infections

who are febrile, have a GCS less than 12, and are less than an
year old [probably with an open atrial fibrillation (AF)], and
those who are clinically stable to undergo the procedure. In
patients who are not stable, a neuroimaging study should be
obtained prior to the lumbar puncture (Box 3).
Cerebrospinal fluid should be examined for pressure, gross
examination for turbidity, cytology, biochemistry, Gram’s
stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid fast bacilli, bacterial culture,
latex agglutination, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV
1 and 2, and IgM antibodies for JE and for dengue virus (if
suspected), and additional cultures based on clinical suspicion
(fungal or tubercular). Concurrent blood sugar must also be
measured to look for the CSF to blood sugar ratio.
Usual CSF findings in viral encephalitis include lymphocytic
pleocytosis, mild to moderately elevated protein, and normal
CSF sugar. Similar findings may occur in tubercular meningitis
and partially-treated pyogenic meningitis; however, the
CSF sugar is likely to be low in these situations. Neutrophilic
predominance is seen in pyogenic meningitis with high protein
levels, and a Gram’s stain, latex agglutination test or culture
may clinch the diagnosis.
Empirical treatment should be started pending the results
of lumbar puncture and/or neuroimaging studies. The CSF
analysis is an important investigation in children with AES.

Neuroimaging
Decision for imaging should not delay the empiric therapy. CT
scan of the brain is of limited value in a patient with AFE, since
it does not definitely indicate either meningeal or parenchymal
involvement; however, it may be the only possible option
available in an emergency. It is known that CT scan is likely to
be normal in many cases of viral encephalitis, especially in the
early stages and is more likely to pick up abnormality in the
later stages when the pathology is well established. Magnetic
resonance imaging is more likely to pick up early lesions in
patients with AFE and should be the radiological investigation
of choice in such patients as soon as it is available.
Computed tomography (CT): If the child is afebrile and deeply
comatose and/or has focal signs, it is preferable to do a CT
scan prior to a lumbar puncture. Focal seizures and presence
of focal neurological deficits indicate a localized lesion and are
expected to be picked up by CT scan. Computed tomography

Ch-33.indd 153

scan may give valuable information such as presence of a
bleed, and basal exudates and hydrocephalus in tubercular
meningitis. The presence of diffuse edema on CT scan may
suggest an underlying parenchymal involvement and focal
hypodensities in temporal lobe and basal ganglia or thalamus
may point towards a possible diagnosis of viral encephalitis
(HSV or JE). Computed tomography may also show brain
herniation, effacement of cisterns, and infective collections
such as brain abscesses and subdural empyema. Computed
tomography should be performed immediately when the
examination suggests increased ICP (papilledema, bulging
fontanel in infants, or bradycardia with hypertension) or a
transtentorial herniation syndrome (Box 4).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): If possible, an MRI
should be obtained, as soon as the patient is stable. Magnetic
resonance imaging is known to be superior in picking up
subtle changes and is likely to be more helpful in establishing
a diagnosis by picking up characteristic pattern of gray
matter involvement and meningeal enhancement. Magnetic
resonance imaging is more sensitive for early evidence of viral
encephalitis and may show frontotemporal pathology in HSV
infection, thalamic involvement in JE, and midbrain and pons
involvement in enterovirus infection. It also picks up infarction,
diffuse axonal injury from head injury, petechial hemorrhages,
cerebral venous thrombosis and necrotizing lesions in acute
necrotizing encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging is
also useful for diagnosing alternative etiologies such as ADEM
(evident as demyelination on MRI), and antibody associated
encephalopathies. Magnetic resonance imaging may also offer
information regarding prognosis in patients with anoxic or
traumatic coma.
Magnetic resonance imaging is not needed if the etiology
is clear by other investigations, e.g., cerebral malaria, pyogenic
meningitis; or if suggestive changes are seen on CT; or in
epidemic situations where the likely etiology is already
known. In all other patients, MRI provides useful information
regarding the etiology and alternative diagnoses. However,
the availability, cost, and difficulties in transporting sick and
unstable patients for MRI may be limiting factors (Box 5).

Clinical Pearls
• Empirical treatment should be started pending the results of
lumbar puncture
• Decision for imaging should not delay the therapy
• Magnetic resonance imaging is preferable to computed
tomography, if available and affordable.

Step 4: Initiate Empiric Therapy
Empiric antimicrobial treatment is recommended when the
diagnosis of bacterial meningitis or herpes encephalitis is
strongly suspected, as early treatment improves prognosis
of these conditions. Treatment may impair the diagnostic
sensitivity of CSF cultures but should not affect other tests
(total cell count, Gram’s stain, or PCR). The recommended
empiric therapy in a case of AFE is a combination of a thirdgeneration cephalosporin, acyclovir and an antimalarial.
A broad-spectrum antibiotic such as ceftriaxone must be
given in a dose of 100 mg/kg/day, which can be stopped if no
evidence of bacterial meningitis is evident in the subsequent
CSF analysis or imaging.
Acyclovir must be started according to age-specific doses,
in all cases of suspected viral encephalitis, as HSE is a treatable
disease, and can be stopped if the HSV PCR in CSF is negative
or the MRI findings are not suggestive of the same. Children
beyond the neonatal group should be treated with intravenous
acyclovir in a dose of 10 mg/kg every 8 hours given as a 1-hour
infusion. A positive MRI scan and EEG have 95% sensitivity
in the diagnosis of HSE. However, if the CSF PCR for HSV or
MRI have been performed very early after the symptom onset
(within 48 hours), these may be falsely negative. Hence, these
studies should be repeated before stopping acyclovir if the
clinical suspicion of HSE continues to be high.
Empirical antimalarials must be started if there is a
suspicion of cerebral malaria. The recommended antimalarial
therapy is an artemisinin-based combination therapy
consisting of artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or
artemether + lumefantrine. Alternatively, quinine may be used
with strict monitoring of blood sugar levels and ECG. This
should be stopped if the peripheral smear and rapid diagnostic
tests are negative.

Step 5: Send Specific
Investigations and Treat the Cause

154

When the etiology is not clear, other microbiological
investigations must be obtained. These samples include urine,
throat swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, serum, and swab from
vesicles or rash, if present. In patients having unexplained
encephalopathy with fever and rash, testing for rickettsial

Ch-33.indd 154

infections (Weil-Felix test, and rickettsial serology) must be
performed. HIV testing should be performed in children with
unexplained encephalitis, as rarely, meningoencephalitis may
be a presenting feature of primary HIV infection.
Additional studies may be indicated if there are clinical
clues suggestive of particular infections. These may include
HSV whole blood PCR in suspected cases of disseminated
HSV infection and serologic testing for measles, mumps,
arboviruses, varicella, EBV, syphilis, and Lyme disease.
Identifiable causes like DKA and hypertensive encephalo­
pathy should be treated according to the recommended
protocols. The clinician should always be alert to the possibility
of child abuse in an infant/toddler with sudden unexplained
altered consciousness.
In suspected cases of opioid ingestion, naloxone should
be administered; atropine and pralidoxime should be given
in suspected organophosphorus poisoning and flumazenil
should be given for benzodiazepine overdose. Antivenom is
recommended in cases of envenomation.

Other Tests
An EEG must be performed in all children with unexplained
altered sensorium to look for suspected NCSE. Periodic
epileptiform discharges may occur in NCSE but also in
underlying brain injury without seizures. Diffuse theta
and delta activity, absence of faster frequencies, and inter­
mittent rhythmic delta activity are characteristic of severe
encephalopathies. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
suggest herpes encephalitis or infarction. Multifocal or
generalized periodic discharges can also be seen with
metabolic and infectious etiologies and are characteristic
of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Triphasic waves
indicate a hepatic or uremic encephalopathy. Nonepileptiform
features of the EEG, such as slowing or asymmetry, are largely
nonspecific findings, but can sometimes provide diagnostic
or prognostic information. Continuous EEG can be used to
assess and titrate the depth of sedation in patients placed
under anesthesia for control of status epilepticus or increased
ICP. Electrocardiogram may also be helpful in patients with
subtle and doubtful seizures, to guide antiepileptic drug
management.
In cases of suspected metabolic abnormalities and
unexplained or recurrent encephalopathy, blood ammonia,
urine and blood samples for amino and organic acid disorders,
free fatty acid and carnitine levels should be obtained before
starting treatment and stopping feeds. Hyperammonemia
may be caused by some inborn errors of metabolism, Reye’s
syndrome, liver failure, or valproate toxicity. Blood tandem mass
spectroscopy, urine gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy
can detect common causes of intoxication and drug abuse, and
specific drug levels (suspected antiepileptic toxicity) should be
obtained if specific ingestions are suspected. In selected cases,
a urine toxicology screen, thyroid function tests and thyroid
autoantibodies (Hashimoto’s encephalopathy), cortisol levels,
carboxyhemoglobin levels (carbon monoxide poisoning),
autoimmune screen (cerebral vasculitis), and coagulation
studies (coagulopathy) are recommended.

Chapter 33: Approach to a Child with Acute Febrile Encephalopathy

Step 6: Supportive Care
After stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation,
other supportive care measures must be instituted along
with the empirical treatment as mentioned above. Timely
and appropriate supportive care is of paramount importance
to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with viral
encephalitis. Patients with GCS less than 8, having features
of raised ICP, status epilepticus, and shock should ideally be
managed in an intensive care unit. Full sedation, controlled
ventilation, and minimal handling with elevation of the head
end of the bed at 30°, should be maintained during transport
of the child.

Maintenance Intravenous Fluids
Fluid therapy should be targeted to maintain euvolemia and
normoglycemia, and to prevent hyponatremia. Children with
acute viral encephalitis should receive fluids at the normal
daily requirement. Increased fluids and fluid boluses may be
indicated for dehydration and hypotension. Serum sodium
should be monitored, and abnormalities of serum sodium
should be corrected slowly. Rapid correction of hyponatremia
may lead to central pontine myelinolysis.

Other Drugs
Corticosteroids: Steroids are indicated in meningococcemia
with shock, enteric encephalopathy, ADEM, Hashimoto’s
encephalopathy, and autoimmune encephalitis. The role of
corticosteroids in the treatment of viral encephalitis is not
established. However, corticosteroids may be considered along
with acyclovir in patients with marked cerebral edema, brain
shift or raised ICP. Dexamethasone is recommended prior
to antibiotics in H. influenzae B meningitis, as it reduces the
incidence of deafness and neurological handicap. However,
this benefit is not certain for meningitis due to other organisms
like Pneumococcus.
If metabolic causes have been identified, e.g., DKA, hepatic
encephalopathy, uremia, or hyperammonemia, these should
be treated appropriately. Concurrent bacterial infections like
pneumonia should be appropriately treated. Haloperidol
and phenergan may be used to combat the abnormal or
psychotic behavior. Dopamine receptor blocking agents are
used to control the choreoathetosis, and muscle relaxants and
anticholinergics may help in the management of dystonia.

Step 7: Prevention/Treatment of
Complications and Rehabilitation
The clinical course of the child should be monitored closely
and documented on a daily basis. Particular attention should
be paid to changing level of consciousness, fever, seizures,
autonomic nervous system dysfunction, increased ICP, and
speech and motor disturbances.
Supportive and rehabilitative efforts are very important after
patients recover. Nosocomial infections, aspiration pneumonia,
and coagulation disturbances may occur as complications,
and should be detected and treated promptly. Motor
incoordination, convulsive disorders, total or partial deafness,

Ch-33.indd 155

and behavioral disturbances are commonly seen after viral
CNS infections. Visual disturbances due to chorioretinopathy
and peripheral amblyopia may also be seen. Myocarditis and
pulmonary edema are important complications of enteroviral
encephalitis. Subdural effusions develop in 10–30% of patients
with meningitis. Other complications include seizures, raised
ICP, cranial nerve palsies, stroke, herniation syndromes, and
thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses. Pericarditis or arthritis
may occur in patients being treated for meningitis, especially
that caused by Neisseria meningitidis.
Rifampicin chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all close
contacts of patients with meningococcal and H. influenzae B
meningitis. Vaccination for H. influenzae B is recommended
for all children, and meningococcal and pneumococcal
vaccine should be given to the high-risk groups. Vaccination
for polio, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella should also
be instituted. Control of insect vectors by suitable spraying
methods and eradication of insect breeding sites reduces the
incidence of arboviral infections and malaria.
Regular posture change must be done to prevent the
development of bed sores. The patient should be started
on early physiotherapy, to prevent the development of
contractures. Neurodevelopmental and audiologic evaluations
should be a part of the routine follow-up of children who have
recovered from viral meningoencephalitis. Metabolic causes
may need long-term dietary treatment. Psychological support
needs to be rendered to the patient and family.

PROGNOSIS
The outcome of a child with an AFE depends on the etiology,
and the depth and duration of impaired consciousness,
the specific cause and the age of the child. Prolonged coma
after a hypoxic-ischemic insult carries a poor prognosis.
Most children surviving infectious encephalopathies have a
comparatively better outcome, often surviving with mild or
moderate difficulties only. Outcome has been shown to be
worse for patients who were younger, had a lower GCS score
on presentation, or had absent brainstem reflexes, poor motor
responses, hypothermia, or hypotension. These children
should be followed up for early identification of developmental
disabilities, learning and behavior problems, as well as other
neurological sequelae such as motor, visual, or hearing deficit
and seizure disorder. Acute complications like motor deficits
and cortical blindness improve with time.

CONCLUSION
Diagnostic approach to a child presenting with an AFE poses a
real challenge, especially when the history is not reliable and
the clinical findings are not contributory towards a specific
etiology. A high index of suspicion should be maintained
for a diagnosis in these patients as time is the essence in the
management strategy. A systematic approach to the history,
thorough physical examination and appropriate investigations
aimed at recognition of the etiology could aid in the diagnosis.

measures remain the cornerstone of management, and
identification of the cause and its appropriate treatment need
to be instituted in order to ensure the survival and also to
prevent long-term sequelae, neurological or otherwise.

Management of a
Child with Respiratory Distress
Sanjay M Bafna, Kochurani Abraham

INTRODUCTION
Respiratory distress (RD) is a manifestation of variety
of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. Prompt
recognition and early intervention prevent progression of RD
to respiratory failure (RF) and cardiorespiratory arrest.
This chapter describes general management approach
to RD with main focus on emergency room management.
Detailed specific management of conditions causing RD is
discussed elsewhere in the book.

DEFINITIONS
Respiratory distress is a clinical state characterized by
abnormal respiratory rate or effort. It commonly manifests as
tachypnoea and increased work of breathing.
A child with neurological illness usually has abnormal
pattern of respiration and/or bradypnoea.
Respiratory failure is defined as a clinical state of
inadequate oxygenation or ventilation or both. It is often the
end stage of RD.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Most important function of respiratory system is oxygenation
and ventilation. Impaired oxygenation in lungs results in
hypoxemia. This may occur due to alveolar hypoventilation,
V/Q mismatch or right to left shunt.
Tissue oxygenation depends on oxygenation in lungs,
cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, and tissue perfusion.
Impairment of any of these would result in tissue hypoxia.
Inadequate ventilation is seen in airway disease, lung
parenchymal disease, and central hypoventilation. This results
in hypercarbia.
Conditions causing tissue hypoxia or hypercarbia result in
RD as a compensatory mechanism to maintain adequate gas
exchange.
When these compensations fail, child develops RF.

Ch-34.indd 157

INITIAL EVALUATION AND STABILIZATION
The first priority is evaluation and stabilization of airway,
breathing, and circulation.

Airway
The airway is assessed to see if it is patent or obstructed. This
is done by “look, listen, and feel” for air movement. Abnormal
airway sounds and/or poor air entry may indicate obstructed
airway.
The airway can be clear, maintainable or not maintainable.

Clear Airway
Allow the child position of comfort.

Maintainable airway
This essentially means that the airway may be partially
obstructed but is maintainable by simple maneuvers like
positioning, suctioning, removal of foreign body, or use of
airway adjuncts.
• Head tilt/chin lift: if the airway is blocked by the falling
back of the tongue, it may be opened by this maneuver.
The rescuer places one hand on the forehead and applies
pressure to tilt the head back gently, to achieve neutral
position in an infant and sniffing position in a child. Two
to three fingers of the other hand should then be placed
under the chin to lift it upwards. The thumb of this hand
may be used to part the lips to keep the mouth open
• Jaw thrust: this is used in suspected cervical spine injury
as head tilt-chin lift is contraindicated. This is achieved by
placing two or three fingers under the angle of the mandible
bilaterally, and lifting the jaw upwards.

Not maintainable airway
It may need one of the following advanced airway interventions:
• Endotracheal intubation
• Laryngeal mask airway in unconscious patient

• Consider an oropharyngeal airway (OPA) or
nasopharyngeal airway (NPA)

Breathing

• Monitor O2 saturation
• Provide humidified O2. Use a high concentration
delivery device like nonrebreathing mask for
treatment of severe respiratory distress
• Administer inhaled medication (e.g., salbuterol,
epinephrine) as needed
• Assist ventilation with bag mask device and
supplementary O2 if needed
• Prepare for endotracheal intubation if indicated

Circulation

• Monitor heart rate, rhythm and blood pressure
• Establish vascular access

This can be supported by administration of oxygen or by
assisted ventilation. It is important to differentiate RD from RF
at initial evaluation. Child with RF has features of hypoxemia
and hypercarbia.

Clinical Pearl
• Respiratory failure is a clinical diagnosis. Arterial blood gas is
done for confirmation and monitoring.

In a child with RD, maintenance of airway, administration
of oxygen, etiological management, and monitoring may
suffice. But in a child with RF, one must take total control of
airway and breathing.

Oxygen Delivery
In a child with RD, proper administration of high concen­
tration of oxygen is the mainstay of therapy. Oxygen is given in
a nonthreatening manner to a child with RD, avoiding agitation
as far as possible, as this increases the work of breathing and
makes the flow of air turbulent thereby increasing the resistance
to air flow. Taking the mothers help to provide oxygen goes a
long way in decreasing the child’s agitation. Nasal prongs and
a simple face mask do not provide a high concentration of
oxygen and are unreliable for use in the emergency room. The
devices which can be used are a nonrebreathing mask with a
flow rate of 10–12 L/m, an oxygen hood in infants with a flow of
10–15 L/m or a flow inflating bag with a flow rate of three times
minute ventilation.

Assisted Ventilation

Respiratory problem is categorized as one of the following:
• Upper airway obstruction (UAO)
• Lower airway obstruction (LAO)
• Lung tissue disease
• Disordered control of breathing.

TARGETED INTERVENTIONS

Child with severe RD or RF will need advanced airway measures
and assisted ventilation. Assisted ventilation can be provided
by bag-mask ventilation (BMV), noninvasive ventilation or
endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
In most emergencies, effective BMV usually provides
adequate oxygenation and ventilation until definite control of
airway can be achieved. BMV can be as effective as ventilation
through endotracheal (ET) tube for short periods of time and
may be safer when provider is inexperienced in insertion of
advanced airway.
Table 1 summarizes the initial management of child
with RD.

Targeted intervention includes:
• General measures as per the type of respiratory problem
• Specific measures as per the etiology.
Following sections describe important emergency room
measures in a child with RD. The specific measures depend on
the underlying etiology, which are mentioned here briefly. The
detailed description is given elsewhere in this book.

ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE THE SEVERITY
AND TYPE OF RESPIRATORY PROBLEM

The most important priority in UAO is to open and maintain a
patent airway. The measures needed to do so are described in
table 1.
• When UAO is severe, call for help of a person with expertise
in airway management
• In less severe UAO, children may benefit from insertion
of an oropharyngeal airway (OPA) or nasopharyngeal

Severity

airway (NPA), which may relieve the obstruction caused
by the tongue
Use OPA only in comatose child
A child with intact gag reflex may tolerate an NPA
Child with redundant tissues or tissue edema may benefit
from application of CPAP.

Clinical Pearl
• Failure to aggressively treat a partial upper airway obstruction
can lead to complete airway obstruction and cardiac arrest.

• More than 1 year: heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrust)
One of the given outcomes may follow:
• Relief from obstruction: evaluation
• Incomplete obstruction: managed as above
• Child becomes unresponsive: start cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR). Before you deliver a breath, look into
the mouth. If you a see a foreign body that can be easily
removed, remove it.

Angioneurotic Edema
Steps in management of anaphylaxis are summarized in box 1.

Specific Management
Apart from initial interventions mentioned in table 1, additional
measures as per etiology focus on relieving the obstruction.
Table 2 summarizes the clinical features of various UAO

• Hyperacute onset of breathlessness in an alert child should
arouse suspicion of foreign body aspiration or anaphylaxis.

Foreign Body Aspiration

Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis

Management depends upon degree of obstruction.

Treatment of child with acute laryngotracheobronchitis
depends upon severity as described in table 3.

Incomplete obstruction
(Child is breathing, coughing, and able to make sounds).
• Position of comfort
• Supplemental oxygen
• Rigid bronchoscopy.

Clinical Pearl
• Do not perform blind finger sweep, it may push the foreign
body further into the airway.

Complete obstruction
(No sound, unable to cough, and unable to breathe adequately).
Perform following maneuvers:
• Less than 1 year: five back blows followed by five chest
thrusts

Box 1: Management of anaphylaxis
• Administer adrenaline 1:1,000 IM 0.01 mL/kg, repeated every
10–15 minutes as needed
• Treat bronchospasm with salbutamol metered-dose inhaler or
nebulization
• For severe respiratory distress, anticipate further airway swelling
and prepare for endotracheal intubation
• To treat hypotension:
{{ Place the child in Trendelenburg position as tolerated
{{ Administer normal saline bolus 20 mL/kg (repeat as needed)
{{ Consider adrenaline drip for hypotension unresponsive to
above measures
• Administer diphenhydramine and H2 blocker
• Administer methylprednisolone or equivalent corticosteroid IV

The most important priority is to maintain adequte
oxygention and ventilation
The aim is to maintain SpO2 above 94%
Use appropriate oxygen delivery device with optimum
flow rate
In severe RD, administer oxygen by nonrebreathing mask
to provide 100% oxygen
If assissted ventilation is required, perform BMV at
relatively slow rate.

Clinical Pearl

Hypertonic saline, steroids, ribavirin: conflicting reports,
variable response. None have proven benefit.
Table 4 summarizes acute asthma treatment in emergency

LUNG TISSUE DISEASE
Common causes of lung tissue disease are:
• Pneumonia
• Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
• Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

General Management
Initial interventions are listed in table 1.
In children with refractory hypoxemia, consider CPAP,
noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation with positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

• Ventilating at slow rate in lower airway obstruction reduces the
risk of air trapping and complications of high airway pressure.

Clinical Pearl
• Saturated oxygen of arterial blood less than 90% on 100%
oxygen is an indication for assisted ventilation.

Specific Management
Common causes of LAO are asthma and bronchiolitis.

Hypovolemic Shock
Parmanand GK Andankar

INTRODUCTION
Circulatory shock is a common emergency encountered
in pediatric practice. Shock has been defined as a patho­
physiological state in which there is an inadequate supply or
inappropriate use of metabolic substrate (particularly oxygen)
by peripheral tissues. It is often classified as hypovolemic,
cardiogenic, obstructive, or distributive.

sive nasogastric/fistula/enterostomy losses, sodium-losing
nephro­pathy, and diuretic therapy are usually associated with
low, plasma-protein losses.

Clinical Pearl
• Hemorrhage can be concealed in the abdominal or thoracic
spaces, in retroperitoneal tissues or in tissues surrounding
bony fractures.

CAUSES (BOX 1)
Hypovolemic shock is caused by a loss of intravascular fluid
which is usually whole blood or plasma.
Whole blood loss (hemorrhagic): Blood loss may occur from an
open wound or from concealed hemorrhage in the abdominal
or thoracic spaces (e.g., hemothorax, lacerated liver, spleen
or kidney, gastrointestinal hemorrhage), in retroperitoneal
tissues (with ruptured aorta or coagulation abnormality) or in
tissues surrounding bony fractures.
Plasma loss (nonhemorrhagic): Intravascular volume deple­
tion due to excessive extracellular fluid loss with or without
loss of plasma protein. For example, pancreatitis, peritonitis,
burns, crush syndrome, and anaphylaxis tend to have a high
plasma protein loss, whereas vomiting, diarrhea, exces­

CLINICAL FEATURES
The clinical features of hypovolemic shock are the same as those
of shock (in general), i.e. tachycardia, poor peripheral pulses,
delayed capillary refill time, cool extremities, pallor, and poor
urine output. In addition, the child may have hypotension,
dyspnea, and change in sensorium.
It is the history which provides specific clues to the shock
being hypovolemic.

INVESTIGATIONS
Complete blood count, electrolyte levels (Na+, K+, Cl−, HCO3−),
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose levels, prothrombin
time, activated partial thromboplastin time, arterial blood
gases, and urinalysis.
Blood should be typed and cross-matched.

Prevention of Further Injury

What fluids?

•
•

Three randomized controlled trials compared the use of
colloid to crystalloid resuscitation in children with dengue
shock. No difference was shown in mortality between those
resuscitated with colloid or crystalloid. Similarly, there were
no differences in outcome (new organ failure, duration of
ventilation, renal replacement therapy, or length of stay)
and mortality after albumin administration (versus saline).
Albumin and normal saline were equally effective for fluid
resuscitation [Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE)
Study]. Thus, isotonic crystalloid solutions are as effective as
colloid solutions for the majority of patients with hypovolemic
shock (Table 1).
Dutch Pediatric Society evidence-based clinical practice
guidelines recommend that in neonates and children with
hypovolemia the first-choice fluid for resuscitation should be
isotonic saline.
If loss of protein containing fluids is documented or sus­
pected (clue: low albumin), or if resuscitation is not responding
to crystalloids, only then should colloids be administered.
In patients with crystalloid refractory hemorrhagic shock,
PRBC 10 mL/kg should be administered promptly.

Cervical spine must be immobilized
Splinting of fractures.

General Shock Management
Position of Child
Stable: Allow to remain with caregiver in a position of comfort.
Unstable: If hypotensive, place in Trendelenburg position
unless breathing is compromised.

Airway
•
•

Open, clear, maintained
Consider intubation.

Breathing
•
•
•
•

To optimize arterial O2 content
Start oxygen by nonrebreathing mask at flow rate 10–15 L/min
Assist ventilation if required
When in doubt, ventilate.

Circulation
•
•
•
•

Establish venous access or intraosseous access or central
line
Replace fluid
Give an isotonic fluid (crystalloid) bolus of 20 mL/kg to
restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion
For trauma and hemorrhage, administer packed red blood
cells (PRBCs).

Monitor
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mental status
Heart rate
Respiration
Blood pressure
Electrocardiogram
Arterial oxygen saturation
Temperature
Urine output.

Clinical Pearl
• If peripheral access is not readily obtained, intraosseous access
may be established quickly and reliably in patients of any age.

How much fluid?
Surviving sepsis guideline suggests that initial resuscitation
begin with infusion of crystalloids with boluses of 20 mL/kg
over 5–10 minutes. The amount of fluid necessary to restore
effective circulating blood volume depends on amount of fluid
lost and rate of ongoing losses. The volume of fluid required
for resuscitation can be 40–60 mL/kg or higher. However,
a child with nonhemorrhagic hypovolemic shock should
generally respond to 40 mL/kg of crystalloid solution; if a child
is unresponsive to this amount of fluid resuscitation, the child
must be evaluated for complicating factors causing refractory
shock, such as unrecognized pneumothorax or pericardial
effusion, intestinal ischemia, sepsis, myocardial dysfunction,
adrenocortical insufficiency, and pulmonary hypertension.

Section 4: Office Emergencies

How fast?

When to start inotrope?

As fast as possible (5–10 minutes).

Fluid administration should be stopped and inotropes should
be started when the ventricular filling pressure (CVP and 2D
Echo) rises, without evidence of improvement in cardiovascular
performance.

How long?
It has been reported that up to 60 mL/kg of fluids may be given
in first hour of therapy in shock without increasing risk of
pulmonary edema. The rate of fluid administration should be
reduced substantially when there are clinical signs of adequate
cardiac filling with hemodynamic improvement. The end point
of fluid resuscitation is when there is normalization of arterial
blood pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate, and adequate
urine output and decrease in metabolic acidosis.
If shock persists, while one may continue with aggressive
fluid resuscitation in aliquots of 20 mL/kg, one needs to
carefully monitor vital parameters, and also more aggressive
monitoring like continuous central venous pressure (CVP), for
response of therapy.
In a hypotensive patient with a CVP of less than 10 mm Hg,
in absence of pulmonary edema, more fluids can be given to
achieve the desired preload.
Inspite of this, if there is no improvement in blood pressure,
peripheral perfusion or urine output, the patient’s diagnosis
should be re-evaluated, and a probable cause of ongoing
depletion should be sought. The child must be evaluated
for complicating factors causing refractory shock such as
unrecognized pneumothorax or pericardial effusion, intestinal
ischemia, sepsis, myocardial dysfunction, adrenocortical
insufficiency, and pulmonary hypertension.
If CVP is greater than 10 mmHg and shock persists, consider
2D echocardiography to rule out cardiac dysfunction.
In hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock, blood must be
transfused if hypotension persists despite adequate crystalloid
infusion. It must be noted that hematocrit is a poor indicator
of severity of hemorrhage, because it does not decline in the
setting of hemorrhagic shock.

Clinical Pearl
• Hematocrit is a poor indicator of severity of hemorrhage,
because it does not decline in the setting of hemorrhagic shock.

Additional/Special Considerations during
Management of Hypovolemic Shock
in Trauma Patients (Table 2)
Even as the primary assessment is being performed,
• Organize trauma team
• Call the surgeon
• Notify the blood bank.

Approach to Fever in Children
Rhishikesh P Thakre

INTRODUCTION
Fever is one of the most common distressing signs of childhood
illness. In majority, the cause is usually viral, self-limited, and
benign, but in few it is due to serious underlying illness. The
clinician’s responsibility is to establish a correct diagnosis
in reasonable time and initiate treatment, if indicated. This
chapter focuses on approach to acute fever.

whether the child is getting better or worse, history of exposure
to sick contacts, use of antipyretics or antibiotics (with their
doses) taken or previous diagnostic tests done and their results.
All efforts should be made to enquire about the oral intake,
fluid losses, urination, recent travel, prior hospitalization, and
vaccination status (Table 1).
Table 1: Key points on history
Note

Comment

Onset

High fever from the very onset usually suggests
viral infection, malaria, or localized bacterial
infection at the site of entry of organisms
(tonsillitis/UTI)

Duration

Persistent fever beyond day 3 without localizing
signs calls for laboratory tests

Identifying “High Risk” for Serious Illness

Progress

One should be alert to and identify immediately any lifethreatening features, including compromise of the airway,
breathing, or circulation, and decreased level of consciousness
(Box 1). This identifies seriously-ill children in need for urgent
referral or treatment.

Gradually- improving fever by day 3 or 4
suggests self-limiting viral infection, while
bacterial infections peak by day 3 or 4

Interfebrile
state

Children suffering from viral infection or malaria
appear normal between fever spikes. If the
child continues to appear sick even between
fever spikes, the cause is likely to be a bacterial
infection

Response to
antipyretic

Poor response to optimum doses of paracetamol
or ibuprofen may suggest severe bacterial
infection

Accompanying
symptoms

Bacterial infection usually presents with localization to a part of a system (such as tonsillitis or
pneumonia) while viral infection usually affects
the entire system or multiple systems (such as
respiratory and gastrointestinal system)

Contact with
similar illness

Family member with similar illness suggests
airborne viral infection.

Past history of
infective focus

Device (shunt, implant), underlying anomaly
(CHD, VUR) predispose to early complication and
need urgent evaluation

RECOGNIZING FEVER
The first step is to reliably document fever by measuring
axillary temperature using digital thermometer. Use of oral and
rectal routes is not recommended. A temperature above 38°C
or 100.4°F is considered as fever.

ASSESSMENT OF FEVER
The main goal of evaluation of febrile children is to distinguish
those with mild self-limiting illness from those with serious
bacterial infection (SBI).
An enquiry should be made about the nature of fever,
defining when was the child last well, activity, sleep pattern,

EXAMINATION

Table 4: Pointers to serious bacterial infections in a febrile child

The purpose of examination is directed at locating a source
for fever, with specific attention to potential SBI and resultant
complications. Ill-appearing children are more likely than
well-appearing children to have SBI, and most well-appearing
children do not have SBI.
In addition to temperature one should record the heart
rate, respiratory rate and capillary refill time as part of the
routine assessment (Table 2).

ASSESSMENT FOR LOCALIZING SIGNS
Presence of associated symptoms or signs gives clue to
underlying focus of infection (Table 3). Examination of the
throat and ear is important and often missed. A systematic
examination should then be conducted, including the skin
and nails, head and neck, and the cardiovascular, respiratory,
abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. One
should be aware that classical signs of meningitis like neck
stiffness are classically seen in older children and are often
absent in infants with bacterial meningitis. Hence, one has to
have a high index of suspicion and look for subtle signs like
bulging fontanel, irritability, high pitched cry, or any other
indicator of altered sensorium (Table 4).

An attempt must be made to ensure that possibility of SBI
has been ruled out on clinical grounds.
At times noninfective causes do present with shortduration fever and one should have a high index of suspicion
for them (e.g., Kawasaki disease, leukemia).

INVESTIGATIONS
Many infections can be identified by history and examination
alone, but some infections may be occult. The most common
SBIs in infants that may not be clinically apparent are
bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and pneumonia.
Tempo and complexity of workup is decided by the pace of
illness. Investigations must be done on all sick children and in
those without localization by 72 hours.
• Complete hemogram: A white blood cell (WBC) count
of greater than 15,000/mm3 or less than 5,000/mm3, a
band-to-neutrophil ratio ≥0.2 is considered abnormal.
An abnormality is a relatively poor surrogate marker for
bacteremia (Table 5)
• Urinalysis (dipstick, urinalysis, microscopy, Gram’s stain,
culture) must be considered in presence of fever without
localization, particularly in younger children or when UTI
is suspected. A urine dipstick test positive for nitrite or
leukocyte esterase or a finding of greater than 10 WBCs/hpf
or organisms seen on Gram’s stain is considered abnormal
• Chest X-ray is useful in children with respiratory
localization. Chest film should be considered in an infant
with an unexplained WBC count of greater than 20,000, or
with prolonged fever or cough
• In children with no definitive diagnosis beyond day 3 or
where antibiotic is to be initiated, blood culture must be
done. It is the gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial
infection
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (cytology, Gram’s
stain and culture) is mandatory in every suspected case of
meningitis and also in all sick infants without localization.
CSF fluid with greater than 8 WBC/mm3 or organisms on
Gram’s stain is considered abnormal.

No combination of clinical assessment and diagnostic
testing will successfully identify all patients who have serious
infection at the time of initial presentation; therefore, the
importance of timely reassessment with good history,
systematic confident clinical examination and intelligent
use of laboratory tests, a rational approach cannot be overe­
mphasized.

INDICATIONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION
Most infants and children who have fever and are otherwise
healthy, who are well appearing with no localization can be
managed on an outpatient basis. The degree of illness should
be determined through the child’s interactions with the
environment; observing their alertness, playfulness and feeding
pattern with appearance of any new symptoms (Box 2).

•

Supportive treatment: supportive treatment of fever is
symptomatic. Not all fevers need treatment. Primary goal
of treating the febrile child should be to improve the child’s
overall comfort rather than focus on the normalization of
body temperature.
Cooling: involves nursing in cool environment and
unbundling the child. Sponging is reserved for patients
with hyperthermia (temperature more than 38.5°C) after
30 minutes of antipyretic dose.
Antipyretics: the use of antipyretics should be indi­
vidual­
ized and based on the child’s well-being, not
temperature alone. Antipyretics should be used as
‘‘therapy’’ for fever rather than ‘‘control”. Treatment
for fever with antipyretic is indicated if the child has
discomfort, i.e., irritable, drowsy, greater than 40°C, pain,
or excessive crying. Both paracetamol (10–15 mg/kg, 4–6
hourly) and ibuprofen (5–10 mg/kg, 6 hourly) are effective
antipyretics.
Hydration should be ensured for all febrile children by
increasing oral intake as for every 1°C rise in temperature
the fluid requirement increases by 10%.
Empiric treatment: empiric treatment is not routinely
recommended. It is justified only in toxic children and

•

neonates and that too, only after sending relevant investi­
gations. It is directed towards the probable underlying
cause of illness and most probable organism.
Specific treatment: specific therapy should be directed
towards the specific cause identified on evaluation like
UTI, pneumonia, etc.
Follow-up: not all febrile children have a focus identified
on first evaluation. All such children should be followed
up on outpatient department basis continuing with
symptomatic treatment at home. Parents should be
made aware about the danger signs and asked to report
immediately if there are any concerns or appearance of
new symptoms.

SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:
FEVER IN NEWBORN (<30 DAYS)
Physical examination has marked limitations to predict
accurately a serious infection in neonates. All febrile newborns
should be screened for complete blood count, CSF study and
for culture of urine and blood. X-ray chest should be done if
a respiratory cause is suspected. Febrile neonates should be
hospitalized regardless of the results of laboratory studies and
given intravenous antibiotics till infection is ruled out.

PARENT EDUCATION: FEVER PHOBIA
Parents should be made aware that fever is a symptom and not
an illness. The severity of fever does not necessarily correlate
with seriousness of illness. Child’s well-being is more important
than the height of the fever. The risk of febrile convulsion is less
than 5% and it is a benign event.

Clinical Pearls
• Uncommon manifestations of common diseases are more
likely than are rare diseases
• Clues to the diagnosis are frequently present in the history and
physical examination but are not elicited or unappreciated.
Therefore, thoroughness and repetition are vitally important.

Approach to
Poisoning in Children
Somashekhar M Nimbalkar

INTRODUCTION

MANAGEMENT OF POISONING

Data regarding poison exposure is not well maintained in
India; but based on global trends it can be assumed with fair
approximation that the poison exposure in children in India
would range above 8 million at the least.

ETIOPATHOGENESIS
Common causes of poisoning in India vary geographically
and are dependent on access to various agents. Healthcare
providers should be familiar with common poisonings in
their area.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Most children present with nonspecific symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting, or altered sensorium. However, there are
certain toxidromes, which, on recognition, can give us a clinical
diagnosis (Tables 1 and 2).

Initial Assessment and
Emergency Management
In a responsive patient, initial management in all patients
presenting to the emergency is focused on airway, breathing,
and circulation.

Airway
Presence of abnormal sounds like stridor, gurgling sounds,
or noisy breathing may indicate that the airway is partially
obstructed. Altered sensorium indicates that the child’s airway
is at risk. In such cases, measures to manage airway should
be initiated. These may include positioning, oropharyngeal
airways, laryngeal mask airways, or endotracheal intubation.
Caustic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and
plants containing calcium oxalate crystals can predispose to
airway edema and obstruction.

hypovolemia, followed by inotropes and specific antitoxins

inotropes can worsen hypotension. In a similar fashion,
arrhythmias should be managed with specific antidotes,
crystalloids, and antiarrhythmics.

and ecstasy. An enlarged anion gap greater than 18 is found
in ethanol, iron, methanol, salicylates, and ethylene glycol.
Hypokalemia is seen in beta agonist and theophylline
poisoning, while hyperkalemia is seen in digoxin ingestion.

Clinical Pearls

Disability
Neurological function is assessed by measuring conscious­
ness, pupillary size, posture, and presence of convulsive
movements. Level of consciousness can be measured by
using the AVPU scale. Poisoning with opiates, sedatives,
antihistamines, and hypoglycemic agents should be considered
in children with lower level of consciousness. Large pupils
suggest amphetamines, ecstasy, theophylline and tricyclicantidepressant poisoning (all of these cause hypertonia)
while small pupils suggest opiates and organophosphorus
poisonings. Convulsions can be treated by lorazepam or
midazolam. Trial of naloxone should be considered in
suspected opiate poisoning.

Exposure
The core temperature of the child should be recorded.
Salicylates, anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, cocaine, and
dissociative drugs such as ketamine can cause a fever. Anti­
pyretics are not effective and external and internal cooling
measures should be used to reduce the core temperature to
less than 39°C. Benzodiazepines, dantrolene, or paralysis and
mechanical ventilation should be used to reduce excessive
heat production due to agitation or muscle rigidity.

Monitoring and Investigations
Monitoring includes pulse oximetry, continuous ECG
monitoring, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and core
temperature monitoring. Blood investigations should include
arterial blood gases and blood glucose.
Complete blood count, urinalysis, and tests of hepatic and
renal function are done. If facilities exist then plasma drug
concentrations of a few drugs such as paracetamol, salicylates,
iron, lithium, theophylline, methanol, digoxin, ethylene glycol,
anticonvulsants, methaemoglobin, and carboxyhemoglobin
should be done. However, they should not be part of the general
screen; rather they should be done only when suspected, for
confirmation of the diagnosis. Usually the results are available
later and do not impact initial management. Additionally,
interpretation of results should be carefully done in neonates
as levels of cholinesterase and carboxyhemoglobin may differ
from children. A strip of the child’s ECG should be studied,
especially if arrhythmias are suspected, and a chest x-ray
should be done if there is clinical suspicion of aspiration or
pulmonary edema.
Results of investigations can assist in identifying drugs
that may have caused the poisoning. Metabolic acidosis is
seen with carbon monoxide, iron, methanol, ethylene glycol,
tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates, tricyclic antidepressants,

• Interpretation of drug concentrations and enzymes in
neonates differs from children
• Activated charcoal does not absorb iron, metals, lithium,
cyanides, petroleum distillates, and alcohol.

Poison Elimination
Minimizing toxin exposure: this step is especially helpful in
cases of topical and inhaled toxin exposure. External toxin
decontamination prevents ongoing toxicity to the child
and also protects staff from exposure. The child needs to be
disrobed including removal of jewelry, watches, etc. and the
entire body or exposed area washed, preferably in a suitable
area in the emergency room. Ocular exposures should be
managed by irrigating the eye with copious isotonic saline
(such as normal saline or lactated ringers) for at least half-anhour or till normal ocular pH is obtained. Prior use of ocular
anesthetics such as tetracaine will ensure better irrigation.

Toxin Elimination
The evidence for toxin elimination from the gastrointestinal
tract is inconclusive, yet it continues to be used in certain
circumstances. In asymptomatic children with nontoxic
ingestions, it is not required. However, if the ingestion is
recent, the child symptomatic, or there is a possibility of
delayed toxicity, then decontamination by various methods is
recommended.

Activated Charcoal
Activated charcoal has a surface area of 1,000 m2/g, is safe and
can be used in the dose of 1 g/kg per dose and is capable of
binding a number of poisonous substances without being
systematically absorbed. It, however, does not absorb iron,
metals, lithium, cyanides, petroleum distillates, and alcohol.
The dose is generally 10 times the estimated poison dose, and
generally children are given 25–50 g. Repeated doses can be
used in aspirin, barbiturates, and theophylline as they promote
drug reabsorption from the circulation into the bowel and thus
interrupt enterohepatic cycling. Charcoal is unpalatable and
hence flavoring may be necessary. This does reduce charcoal’s
activity. Aspirated charcoal can cause lung damage. Usefulness
of activated charcoal beyond 1 hour of ingestion is limited but
can be considered, if delayed gut absorption is expected.

Emesis
Emesis by administration of ipecac syrup is not recommended
for gastrointestinal decontamination.

Chapter 37: Approach to Poisoning in Children

Gastric Lavage

Table 3: Antidotes and management of selected toxic exposures

Lavage is not routinely recommended for decontamination
due to variable results, lack of evidence of improved outcomes,
and significant adverse effects. Gastric lavage is initiated in
children who present within 1 hour. It is contraindicated
in poisonings by most hydrocarbons, alkalis, and acids. In
children, additional difficulty is encountered as the small
size of the lavage tube makes it difficult to remove the toxin.
Children often need to be intubated to facilitate the procedure,
especially if they have altered sensorium. Most commonly it
is effectively used in iron over ingestion and the usual fluid
is water or isotonic solution, in aliquots of 10–20 mL/kg. To
perform lavage, the child is placed on its left side and a lavage
tube is passed into the stomach. Fluid is aspirated and small
aliquots of fluid are instilled and reaspirated. This process is
continued till the aspirate is clear. After lavage, the tube can be
used for instilling specific antidote or activated charcoal.

Pyridoxine

This is not routinely indicated but is used in poisoning by
sustained-release or enteric-coated drugs, metals such as
iron and lithium, and drug packets that have long absorption
time or are not bound by charcoal. A large volume (>1 L)
polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution is administered at
a fast rate, via nasogastric tube. Effectiveness is seen until
about 4 hours after ingestion of enteric-coated tablets and
sometimes even until about 12–16 hours after administration
of some sustained-release medications. It causes formation
of liquid stools and reduces transit time of intestinal contents.

Cathartics
These are of equivocal efficacy. Saccharide (Sorbitol) and
saline (magnesium citrate) cathartics have been administered
as a single dose.

Clinical Pearls
• Ipecac syrup is not recommended for gastrointestinal deconta­
mination
• Cathartics are of unknown efficacy.

Methylene blue

Other Methods of Elimination
Urinary alkalinization by the administration of sodium
bicarbo­nate, effectively increases the elimination of drugs
with a low pH such as salicylates and chlorpropamide.
Alkalinization increases the ionized fraction of the drug in the
tubular lumen, preventing its reabsorption. Hemodialysis is
used for salicylates, toxic alcohols, lithium, and theophylline.
Charcoal hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, exchange trans­
fusion and continuous ultrafiltration techniques may also
be used.

Specific Antitoxins
In some poisonings, antidotes which can counter the poison
may be available (Table 3).

Approach to Burns in Children
Vibha S Bafna

INTRODUCTION

ESTIMATION OF BURNT BODY SURFACE AREA

Burn injuries are third leading cause of unintentional deaths in
children. Around 90% of these burns are caused by household
accidents mostly in the kitchen and mainly by scald injuries.
Adolescents are often involved in flame burns, firecracker
injuries, and high voltage electrical injuries.
This chapter deals with:
• Modern burn classification system
• Estimation of burnt body surface area
• First aid measures
• The initial triage and management strategy
• Further treatment
• Prevention.

Appropriate burn charts like the Barlow’s or Lund and Browder
chart, for different age groups should be used to estimate the
extent of body surface area burnt (Table 2).

Clinical Pearls
• Accurate estimation of the burnt surface area and depth is
required for fluid resuscitation and prediction of eventual
morbidity and mortality
• In small burns, less than10% burnt surface area (BSA), the rule
of palm may be used, especially in outpatient settings. The
palm of the child is roughly 1% of the child’s BSA.

FIRST AID MEASURES

MODERN BURNS CLASSIFICATION
Older descriptions of the burn injuries have now been replaced
by superficial, partial thickness (superficial and deep) and full
thickness burn injuries (Table 1) (Figs 1 to 4).

flames by rolling the child on ground, cover him with a
blanket or a carpet

Remove smoldering clothing or clothes saturated with hot
fluids. Remove all jewelery, especially rings and bracelets
to prevent constriction and vascular compromise
In case of scalds, wash the area with copious water and
cover it with cold wet compresses
In case of chemical injury, brush off any remaining
chemical and wash the affected area with water. Consider
using a neutralizing agent
In case of electrical burns, shut off the current before
touching the victim yourself
Administer analgesic medications as feasible
Arrange for quick and safe transport to nearest adequately
equipped medical facility.

INITIAL TRIAGE AND
MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
Rapidly review the cardiovascular and pulmonary status.
Document pre-existing conditions like asthma, chronic heart,
renal, or hepatic disease, etc.

Airway and Breathing
Ensure and maintain adequate airway and provide humidified
oxygen. Endotracheal intubation may be required in patients
with facial burns or burns in an enclosed space which can
cause inhalational injury leading to laryngeal edema. Hypoxia
or carbon monoxide poisoning is treated with 100% oxygen.

Circulation

Fig. 3: Full thickness burns

Children with burns more than 15% of body surface area (BSA)
require intravenous fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate
perfusion. Ringer lactate 10–20 mL/kg/h is initially infused
until proper fluid replacement can be calculated. All high
tension electrical burns require forced alkaline diuresis to

avoid renal damage due to myoglobinuria caused by muscle
injury. There is high risk of arrhythmias in electrical burns, so
cardiac monitoring should be started immediately on arrival
and cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be instituted
promptly if indicated.

Box 1: Indications for hospitalization for burns
• Burns affecting >15% body surface area
• Full thickness or third degree burns
• Electrical burns caused by high tension wiring or lightening
• Chemical burns

Associated Injuries

• Inhalational burns

Evaluate the child for associated internal or external injuries.
Cervical-spine injury precautions should be observed until it
is ruled out.

• Inadequate home or social environment

Extent and the Depth of Burns

• Burns in patient with significant pre-existing medical conditions

• Suspected child abuse or neglect
• Burns to face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, or major joints
• Associated injuries like fractures

Assess with the help of appropriate charts.

Nil by Mouth

•

Children with more than 15% burns should not receive oral
fluids initially to avoid gastric distension. A nasogastric tube
should be inserted to avoid aspiration.

Catheterization
A Foley’s catheter should be inserted to monitor urine output
in all children who require fluid resuscitation.

Wound Care
All wounds should be wrapped with sterile towels till further
plans of treatment are finalized.

Clinical Pearl
• Emergency room management of burns focuses on airway,
breathing, and fluid resuscitation.

FURTHER TREATMENT
Outpatient Management of Minor Burns
First and second degree burns of less than 10% of BSA can be
treated on an outpatient basis. They do not require tetanus
vaccine except if they are unimmunized. Blisters should
be left intact and dressed with silver sulfadiazine cream.
Debridement of the devitalized skin is required after the
blisters have ruptured.

INPATIENT MANAGEMENT
OF BURNS (BOX 1)
This includes fluid and electrolyte management, adminis­
tration of blood products, antibiotics, wound care, pain relief,
and nutrition.

Fluid Resuscitation
178

Modified Parkland formula is most commonly used to calculate
the initial fluid requirement.

First 24 hours:
4 mL/kg/% of BSA burn of ringer lactate. The first half is
infused over 8 hours and the rest is given over the next
16 hours from the time of burn and not from the time
of hospitalization
{{ In addition routine maintenance fluids are continued.
Second 24 hours:
{{ Half of the first day’s fluid is infused as ringer lactate in
5% dextrose
{{ Decrease sodium concentration in fluids in infants if
urinary sodium is rising
{{ The choice of fluids as colloids or crystalloids is
presently controversial. Colloids may be preferred
in burns more than 85% BSA, to be started after
8–24 hours of injury.
{{

•

Assessment and Monitoring
Monitor: vitals, urine output, mental status, acid-base balance,
hematocrit, and serum proteins. Adjust fluids according to
patient’s response.
Catheterization: it should be done in all children needing fluid
resuscitation or those with genital/buttock or upper-thigh
burns.
IV access: in case of major burns, an adequate central venous
access must be secured for fluid replacement and for central
venous pressure monitoring in patients with hemodynamic
instability. Consider arterial line in patients needing frequent
blood gas monitoring.
Initial investigations: hemogram, urine routine, electrolytes,
blood sugar level, renal function test, serum proteins, other tests
(arterial blood gas, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin
time and cultures, etc. are done as indicated.

Electrolytes
Sodium: supplementation may be required for children with
more than 20% burns, if 0.5% silver nitrate solution is used
as topical antibacterial burn dressing. Oral sodium chloride,
4 g/m² BSA/day is given in 4–6 divided doses to maintain
sodium above 130 mEq/L.

CHAPTER 38: Approach to Burns in Children
Potassium: Maintain levels above 3 mEq/L. Potassium losses
are increased with 0.5% silver nitrate solution or in patients on
aminoglycosides, diuretics, or amphotericin.

Subsequent Fluids and Feeding
Oral feeding may be started as early as 48 hours after a burn
injury with the help of a nasogastric feeding tube. IV fluids are
decreased according to the oral feeds tolerated so as to keep
the total fluid intake constant.

silver) and biobrane (bilaminate membrane with an outer layer
of silicone and an inner layer of a nylon mesh impregnated with
collagen, induces epithelization and neovascularization) are
newer options used in extensive burns. Accuzyme ointment is
a topical enzymatic debridement agent useful in deep second
degree wounds to remove dead tissue and aid early healing.
Deep 2nd degree and 3rd degree burns should be excised
early and grafted. Sequential excision and grafting is often
required in deep burns.

Clinical Pearl

Blood Products: Indications
Packed red blood cells are infused for Hb of less than 8 g/dL.
Consider transfusion in patients with Hb less than 10 g/dL
with systemic infection, hemoglobinopathy, cardiopulmonary
disease, or anticipated (or ongoing) blood loss when repeated
grafting is needed.
Albumin: 5% albumin is infused to maintain a serum albumin
level above 2 g/dL. Following amount is infused over 24 hours
starting on second day.

Fresh frozen plasma: it is indicated for a deranged prothrombin
time (>1.5 times) or activated partial thrombo­plastin time
(>1.2 times) in children who are bleeding or scheduled for
a procedure that could result in blood loss of more than half
blood volume.

Prevention of Infection/Role of Antibiotics
The use of prophylactic antibiotics is controversial. Children
with more than 30% burns should be treated in a bacteriacontrolled segregated unit.
Mortality related to burn injury results from metabolic and
bacterial consequences of large open wound, reduction of host
defense and malnutrition. Specific sites of infection include
wound infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and
blood stream infection.
Fever alone may not be indicative of infection as it may
result from hypermetabolic response. Serial evaluation
of burn wound and close monitoring of vitals and other
parameters is crucial for early detection of infection. Sepsis
screen includes blood cultures, wound swabs, throat swab,
sputum, urine, and stool.
An attempt should be made to isolate the organism before
starting empirical therapy. Broad spectrum antibiotic with
Gram-positive coverage (staphylococci) should be used.

Wound Care and Surgical Management
Wound treatment and prevention of wound infection promote
early healing and improve aesthetic and functional outcomes.
Topical treatment of burns can be done with silver nitrate,
silver sulfadiazine, or mafenide acetate. These agents can
penetrate tissue and prevent infection. Wound coverings like
Aquacel-Ag (absorptive hydrofiber dressing impregnated with

• Second and third degree burns need immediate surgical referral.

Prompt excision and wound closure is achieved with
autografts. Alternatives for wound closure include allograft,
xenografts, and other synthetic skin coverings which may be
useful in extensive burns to limit fluid, electrolyte, heat and
protein loss, and to reduce pain.

Pain Relief
Adequate analgesia, anxiolytics, and psychologic support is
necessary to reduce early metabolic stress and long-term posttraumatic stress disorders. Opiate analgesics like morphine
and anxiolytics like lorazepam can be used in conjunction
for synergistic effect. Procedures like dressing change and
debridement will require adequate sedation and pain relief
with same agents used by IV route. Ketamine is another good
option for procedural sedation.

Nutritional Support
The burn injury produces a hypermetabolic response causing
protein and fat catabolism. Energy expenditure can be
curtailed by early excision and grafting, controlling ambient
temperature and humidity, thus avoiding cold stress, treating
anxiety and pain, and allowing appropriate sleep intervals.
High calorie support consisting of 1,800 cal/m2/day plus
2,200 cals/m2 of burn/day and high proteins, i.e., 3–4 g/kg/day
reduces metabolic stress. Multivitamins, especially B group,
vitamin C, and A, and zinc are also essential.
Alimentation should be started as soon as possible,
parenterally or enterally to meet the high caloric needs.
Parenteral nutrition should be changed to enteral as soon as
practical, to decrease infectious complications.

INHALATIONAL INJURY
It should be suspected in case of: (1) exposure to direct heat—
e.g., steam burns. (2) Child with acute asphxia. (3) Carbon
monoxide (CO) poisoning. (4) Exposure to toxic fumes—e.g.,
cyanides from combustible plastics.
The consequences of burns with inhalational injury can be:
• Early CO poisoning, airway obstruction, pulmonary edema
• Acute respiratory distress syndrome usually evident at 24–
48 hours, although it can occur even later
• Late complications (days to weeks)—pneumonia and
pulmonary emboli.

to ease the early and long-term psychological problems of the
child and his care providers.

39

Approach to Envenomation
Mandar B Patil

INTRODUCTION
Certain reptiles and arthropods secrete and introduce
poisonous fluids into the body of their victims by stings and
bites. This is known as envenomation.
The most common envenomation encountered is due to
snakes and scorpion bites followed less commonly by bee and
wasp sting and rarely by lizards.

APPROACH TO SNAKE BITE
India is inhabited by about 244 species of snakes of which 57 are
poisonous or harmful. The commonly encountered poisonous
snakes in this region include cobra (Naja naja), common krait,
Russell’s viper, saw-scaled viper, and less commonly sea snakes.

How to Identify Venomous Snake
Diagnosis of the species of the bitten snake is important for
optimal clinical management. This is achieved by examining
the dead snake or by the clinical examination of the victim.
Commonly encountered poisonous snakes include (Fig. 2):
• Naja naja: it is the commonest Indian cobra. It is identified
by the famous spectacle mark on the hood. When
challenged, cobras rear up, spread a hood, hiss, and make
repeated strikes towards the aggressor
• Common krait: it is smooth bluish-black with a rounded
head slightly distinct form the neck. There are normally
about 40 thin white cross bands. The under surface is white
• Russell’s viper: the scales are very rough. The pupil of the
eye is distinctly vertical. The body has black edged almond
shaped marks. The best recognition characters are the
short, fat body, the triangular shaped head and a very
regular chain-like pattern. When threatened, it makes a
loud and characteristic hissing sound
• Saw-scaled viper: the scales are rough and heavily keeled,
eyes are large, and the head is wider than the neck. The
body is brown-greyish with a darker zigzag pattern mark
on the back and a distinct or lance mark on the head.

identifying sound.

CLINICAL FEATURES (ALGORITHM 1)
Clinical features suggestive of nonvenomous snake bite are
(also seen in a poisonous snake bite without envenomation or
bite through clothing or leather boots) (Fig. 2):
• Universal fear—a state of shock
• Multiple teeth impressions at bite site
• Absence of significant local swelling or pain
• Anxious victims may overbreathe and develop tingling and
numbness in the limbs, stiffness or tetany of hands and
feet, and dizziness.

Clinical Pearls
• Venomous snake bite is identified primarily by the clinical
signs of envenomation in the victim, although dead snake, if
brought and identified, can add to the diagnosis
• Cobra and krait envenomation result in neurotoxicity
• Viper envenomation causes coagulopathy.

MANAGEMENT OF SNAKE
ENVENOMATION (ALGORITHM 2)
•

•

First aid: Traditional first aid measures such as incision
over bite marks, suction of venom, tourniquets, and local
ice packs should be discouraged
Recommended first-aid measures are:
{{ Reassurance to the victim
{{ Immobilization of the bitten limb with a splint or sling
{{ To avoid interference with the bite wound to prevent
introduction of the infection
{{ Pressure immobilization is recommended only for
bites by neurotoxic elapid snakes, including sea snakes
but not for viper bites
In hospital:
{{ Rapid assessment and resuscitation:
–– Rapid assessment of airway, breathing, circulation,
and level of consciousness
–– If required, urgent resuscitation for prolonged hypo­
tension and shock, terminal respiratory failure,
sudden or rapid deterioration and cardiac arrest
{{ Specific therapy:
–– Polyvalent antisnake venom (ASV):
■■ Dose of ASV:
ǅǅ The dose of the ASV is not determined by
the severity of symptoms of envenomation
ǅǅ 10 vials of ASV are dissolved in 200 mL of NS
and infused over 1 hour

20 WBCT, 20-minute whole blood cloting test.

■■ Repeat dose of ASV:
ǅǅ Hemorrhagic bites: After initial 10 vials
of ASV, no dose is given for next 6 hours.
Then, 20-minute whole blood cloting test
(20 WBCT) is done every 6 hours, and if
positive, a repeat dose of 10 vials is given.
Occasionally, multiple doses may be
required
ǅǅ Neurotoxic bites: If the victim does not
improve (or worsens) after first dose of ASV
and neostigmine over 1–2 hours, another
dose of 10 vials is given. After this, the victim
will either recover or require mechanical
ventilation
■■ Management of anaphylaxis due to ASV:
ǅǅ ASV can result in anaphylaxis
◆◆ Stop ASV infusion
◆◆ Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg intramuscularly
(IM)
◆◆ Hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 2 mg/kg
intravenous (IV)
◆◆ Diphenhydramine 0.2 mg/kg IV
◆◆ After complete recovery, reintroduce
ASV, initially slow and then with a
normal drip rate
■■ 20-minute whole blood clotting test:
ǅǅ Between 2–5 mL of victim’s blood is taken
in a new glass test tube and left undisturbed
for 20 minutes
ǅǅ The tube is tilted to see if the blood is still
liquid (indicating consumption coagulo­
pathy)

183

SECTION 4: Office Emergencies
ǅǅ This test is done to assess effectiveness of
ASV and deciding its subsequent doses
–– Neostigmine:
■■ It is used in victims of postsynaptic type of
neuro­muscular junction block caused by neuro­
toxic snake (cobra) bite. Dose is 25–50 µg/kg IM
every 4 hourly with 0.05 mg/kg atropine IV till
complete neurological recovery
–– Mechanical ventilation:
■■ It is life-saving in victims of respiratory paralysis
due to neurotoxicity by cobra and krait
–– Blood transfusion (including component), volume
expanders, and peritoneal dialysis are indicated
depending upon the clinical situation
■■ The bitten limb is nursed in the most comfortable
position, preferably slightly elevated
■■ Fasciotomy for compartment syndrome.
Note: If dead snake is not brought, snake species could not be
identified, directly look for sign of envenomation.

APPROACH TO SCORPION STING
Scorpion sting is an acute life-threatening, time-limiting
medical emergency among children, usually in villages.
Out of 89 species of scorpions in India, only two are of
medical importance. They are Mesobuthus tamulus (Indian
red scorpion) (Fig. 3) and Palamnaeus swammerdami (Indian
black scorpion) (Fig. 4).

Clinical Features (Fig. 5 and Algorithm 3)
The envenomation is classically characterized by “autonomic
storm”.

Local Manifestations
Soon after sting, the victim experiences severe excruciating
radiating pain from sting site, usually toes and fingers. Sudden
tap at and around the site of sting induces severe pain and

withdrawal—this is the diagnostic sign of sting called “TAP
sign”. Severe pain without systemic involvement is suggestive
of nonvenomous sting.

Systemic Manifestations
Characteristic autonomic storm is divided into four phases:
1. Cholinergic phase
2. Adrenergic-inotropic phase
3. Adrenergic-hypokinetic phase:
{{ Left-ventricular dysfunction leading to cardiogenic
pulmonary edema
4. Recovery phase.
Other features:
• Central nervous system (encephalopathy, stroke, seizures)
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
• Rarely acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure.

Investigations
•

X-ray chest:
For evidence of pulmonary edema
Electrocardiogram (ECG):
{{ Sinus tachycardia (most common)
{{ Sinus bradycardia
{{ Supraventricular tachycardia
{{ Peaked (tented) T waves
{{ Myocardial infarction pattern
{{ Conduction block.

•

Note: Low voltage complexes throughout the record and leftanterior hemiblock indicate a poor prognosis. All victims with
systemic involvement show abnormal ECG.

•

Echocardiography:
Left-ventricular dilatation
{{ Regional-wall motion abnormality
{{ Decreased

Management of scorpion sting

ASV, antiscorpion venom; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; NTG, nitroglycerine.

Management (Algorithm 3)
Local pain:
• Mild tolerable pain need not be treated
• Severe pain: oral NSAIDs, local ice pack application and
xylocaine (local anesthesia).
Fluid therapy:
• Correction and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte
balance.

Scorpion antivenom (SAV):
• Monospecific Fab2 SAV is available for therapeutic use
• Intravenous route
• Administer as early as possible—preferably within first
6 hours of sting
• Dose: 30–100 mL (3–10 vials).
Prazosin:
• Alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist
• A dose of 30 µg/kg/dose orally or through tube feed

185

SECTION 4: Office Emergencies
•

•

It is repeated in the same dose at the end of 3 hours and
according to the clinical response and later every 6 hours
till the extremities are warm, dry, and peripheral veins are
easily visible
The time lag between the sting and administration of
prazosin determines the outcome.

Note: Previously used therapies like atropine, steroids, morphine,
lytic cocktail, nifedipine, and captopril have proven harmful or
deleterious and potentiate the effects of scorpion venom, hence
should be avoided.

Clinical Pearls
• Scorpion envenomation is characterized by autonomic storm
• Prazosin—an α-adrenoreceptor antagonist is antidote to
envenomation
• Time interval between the sting and administration of prazosin
for autonomic storm determines the outcome.

APPROACH TO ENVENOMATION
BY BEES AND WASPS

The most well-known allergic reaction is the type I
anaphylactic or immediate hypersensitivity reaction.
Type III (serum sickness) reactions occur 3–14 days
after the sting and present with fever, headache, urticaria,
lymphadenopathy, polyarthritis, and polyarthralgias.

Mass Stinging Events
Toxicity from massive honeybee envenomation occurs
directly from the systemic effects of the venom, as opposed
to immune-mediated anaphylaxis. Mass envenomations
usually occur when stinging insects respond to an intruder as
a threat to their colony.
• Generalized edema
• Confusion, coma, seizures
• Hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, DIC
• Fever
• Rapidonset diarrhea
• Rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure
• Nausea and vomiting
• Tachycardia and hypotension
• Hepatotoxicity

Management (Algorithm 4)

Bees and wasps are stinging insects belonging to the order
Hymenoptera.

•
•
•
•
•

Hives
Loss of consciousness
Pruritis
Heart palpitations
Dyspnea
Upper airway obstruction.

•

Removal of stinger from the site of sting in case of bee sting
as quickly as possible. Delays in stinger removal cause
more venom to enter the wound
Bee venom is acidic. Hence, neutralize it by applying
alkaline solution like soda or methylene blue. Wasp venom
is alkaline. Hence, it is neutralized by applying vinegar or
lemon juice
Mild local reactions of pain and erythema are managed
with cold compresses and analgesics. Moderate to severe
local reactions are managed with oral or paranteral

Recognition and
Assessment of Critically Ill Child
Praveen Khilnani

INTRODUCTION
In outpatient practice, pediatric specialist as well as general
practitioner comes across common pediatric illnesses freq­
uently. It is important to recognize potentially life-threatening
conditions as well as conditions requiring immediate inter­
vention and transfer to a higher-level medical facility.
Besides accidental trauma, poisoning, insect bites, and
allergic reactions, common medical problems that bring the
child to medical attention are fever, cough, respiratory distress,
cyanosis, earache, poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability,
lethargy, convulsions, and unresponsiveness. Common
conditions that require immediate attention are respiratory
distress, shock, lethargy, and coma.
Since our main goal as a medical practitioner is to prevent
unnecessary mortality and morbidity by prompt and early
recognition of potential problems leading to respiratory or
cardiorespiratory arrest, it is important to pay attention to
the following during history and physical examination done
simultaneously.
• Listen carefully to the mother.
• Do not ignore, it will not get better if something is not done.

Common conditions precipitating cardiac arrest

EVALUATE, IDENTIFY, AND INTERVENE
A carefully performed clinical assessment, including obser­
vation, history, and physical examination, will detect serious
illness with 90% sensitivity. Each component of the evaluation
is effective in identifying serious illness (Fig. 1 and Algorithm 1).
The assessment of a seriously unwell child involves the
following:
• Pediatric assessment triangle (initial impression) (Fig. 2)
• Primary assessment: Airway, breathing, circulation, dis­
ability, exposure (ABCDE) assessment
• Secondary assessment:
{{ Vital signs
{{ Focused history
{{ Detailed physical examination

Initial Impression
It is the rapid assessment of a child with an emergency
condition through visual and auditory evaluation of the child’s
consciousness, work of breathing, and color. It is “from the

door” observation to be completed within seconds and no
equipment is required. The initial assessment of the child’s
overall condition is of crucial importance. If the child exhibits
abnormal findings, proceed immediately to the primary
assessment part of evaluation.

Consciousness
•
•
•

Reflects the adequacy of ventilation, oxygenation, brain
perfusion, body homeostasis, and central nervous system
function
What is the child’s state of consciousness: unresponsive,
irritable, alert?
Does the child look ill?

Work of Breathing
•
•
•

•

Assess body position, visible movements of chest/
abdomen, and breathing pattern
Listen for abnormal audible airway sounds (snoring,
hoarse speech, grunting, and wheezing)
Look for visual signs of increased work of breathing such
as abnormal position or posture (i.e., sniffing position,
tripod position, head bobbing), retractions, nasal flaring,
grunting, gasping, and tachypnea
Reflects the adequacy of airway, oxygenation, and
ventilation. Are the airways obstructed? Is the child short
of breath?

Coloration of Skin
•
•

Assess skin color
Look at the skin and mucus membranes for abnormal color
(pallor, mottling, and cyanosis)
• Reflects the adequacy of cardiac output and perfusion
of vital organs. Is the skin unusually pale, mottled, or
cyanotic?
The initial impression will help decide if the child problem
is life-threatening or not.

Primary Assessment
It uses an ABCDE approach. During the evaluation, primary
assessment and management occur simultaneously. The
primary assessment should be periodically repeated, parti­
cularly after major intervention or when a change in the
patient’s condition is detected (evaluate, identify, intervene)
(Algorithms 2 and 3).

Ch-40.indd 189

The goal is to assess if the airway is patent or if there are signs
of obstruction (e.g., stridor, dyspnea, and hoarse voice). If
the child is unresponsive and cannot talk, cry, or cough,
evaluate for possible airway obstruction. Is the airway noisy
(e.g., snoring, stridor, wheeze, grunting, or hoarse speech)?
Determine if the airway is patent, and able to be maintained
with positioning and suction, or not. If cervical spine injury is
suspected, manually stabilize the head and neck in a neutral,
inline position (jaw thrust without head tilt maneuver to open
the airway).
Look in the mouth for blood, broken teeth, gastric contents,
and foreign objects. If solid material is visualized, remove it with
a gloved finger covered in gauze under direct vision. If a foreign
body is suspected but not visualized, a combination of back
blows and chest thrusts is recommended in infants. In an older
child back blows in a forward leaning position is recommended.
Abdominal thrusts in children are not recommended as their
effectiveness and safety have not been established.
Insert an airway adjunct (e.g., oropharyngeal or naso­
pharyngeal airway, or laryngeal mask airway) as needed
to maintain a patent airway. If airway patency cannot be
maintained, perform tracheal intubation. Rapid sequence
intubation should be considered in all patients, except those in
cardiac arrest, to provide optimum conditions and to minimize
the potential for aspiration. Cricothyrotomy or emergency
tracheostomy can be done as a last resort to maintain airway
patency. Not many pediatricians would be familiar with
performing these procedures, therefore, in anticipation a
consult should be obtained from an airway expert such as
anesthesia or an ear, nose, throat consultant.

Breathing
The goal in assessing breathing is to determine whether there is
adequate gas exchange.
• Will the child lie flat? Is he in the tripod or “sniffing” position?
• Are accessory muscles being used (head bobbing in
infants)? Or is there minimal movement of the chest wall?
• Is there sternal, supraclavicular, substernal, or intercostal
recession present?
• Is nasal flaring present?
• Is the respiratory rate fast, slow, or normal?
• Is cyanosis present?
• Is air movement audible on auscultation?
• What is the oxygen saturation (SpO2)?
Place your cheek near the child’s face and mouth and
feel/listen for air movement and look at the chest/abdomen
for respiratory movement. The child with breathing difficulty
often has a respiratory rate outside the normal limits for their
age. Normal respiratory rate values according to age are listed
in table 1. Initially, the child becomes tachypneic, and as
fatigue begins and hypoxia worsens, the child may progress
to respiratory failure and bradypnea. On auscultation with a
stethoscope over the mid axillary line, try to hear abnormal
lung sounds (e.g., wheeze, crackles, and snoring). Palpate the
chest for tenderness, instability and crepitations. Table 2 shows
types and severity of retractions indicating breathing difficulty.

All children with breathing difficulties should receive high
flow oxygen through a face mask oxygen as soon as the airway
has been assessed and demonstrated to be adequate. Pulse
oximetry is an excellent tool to use in assessing a child’s
breathing. A pulse oximetry reading above 94% indicates
that oxygenation is probably adequate. A reading below 90%
in a child with 100% mask oxygen could be an indication for
assisted ventilation.
If the child is breathing adequately but is unresponsive,
place the patient in recovery position (lateral recumbent) after

Ch-40.indd 190

assessing ABCD with no other abnormal findings. If breathing
is absent or the child is hypoventilating (slow respiratory rate
or weak effort), respiration should be supported with oxygen
via bag-valve-mask device and an airway adjunct needs to be
inserted (e.g., laryngeal mask airway, and endotracheal tube).

Circulation
The goals are to assess adequate cardiovascular function and
tissue perfusion, ensure effective circulating volume, and in
trauma, control of bleeding. Look for following points:
• Is skin color normal, or is it pale or mottled?

varies with age (as noted in table 3); tachycardia can be an
early sign of hypoxia or low perfusion, but it can also reflect less
serious conditions (e.g., fever, anxiety, and pain). Bradycardia
(rate <60/min in children or <100/min in newborns) indicates
serious illness and poor myocardial perfusion.
Pulse quality reflects the adequacy of peripheral perfusion.
A weak central pulse may indicate decompensated shock, and
a peripheral pulse that is difficult to find, weak or irregular
suggests poor peripheral perfusion and may be a sign of shock.
Check the femoral pulse in infants and young children, or
the carotid pulse in an older child or adolescent. If no pulse
is felt, and there are no, or minimal signs of life, commenced
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Next, evaluate the CRT, skin color, and temperature. Normal
CRT is less than 2 seconds. The CRT should be done centrally
(e.g., on the chest) to minimize the impact of environmental
factors. Blood pressure determination and interpretation can
be difficult. Normal blood pressure values in children vary
according to age and are difficult to remember. Table 4 can be
very useful in clinical practice. A low blood pressure indicates
decompensated shock.
An easy formula for determining the lower limit of
acceptable blood pressure is: minimal systolic blood pressure
= 70 + (2 × age in years) (Table 5).
Table 3: Normal heart rates (per minute) by age

Blood pressure trends are useful in determining the child’s
condition and response to treatment.

Disability (Mental Status)
Assess the patient by looking at appearance as part of initial
impression and at level of consciousness with the AVPU (Alert,
response to Verbal stimuli, response to Pain, Unresponsive)
scale (Table 6). The pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a
second option (Table 7).
Evaluate the brainstem by checking the responses in each
pupil to a direct beam of light. A normal pupil will constrict
after a light stimulus. Evaluate the motor activity by looking for
symmetrical movement of the extremities, seizures, posturing,
or flaccidity.
• What is the child’s AVPU score?
• Is the child mobile? Or is there limited movement with
poor muscle tone?
• If the child is crying or speaking, is this strong or weak?
• If crying, can the child be consoled?
• Does the child fix their gaze on the carer(s), or does he/she
have a glazed appearance?
• Is the child’s behavior normal for their developmental age?
• Is the child having convulsions, is he stiff or floppy?
With knowledge of the child’s appearance from the initial
appearance and AVPU scale, if the disability assessment
demonstrates altered level of consciousness, begin with general
life support/monitoring with oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and
pulse oximetry. Intubation should be considered if GCS is less
than 8.

Initial Stabilization
Things required at all practice locations (hospital or private
practice clinic):
• Oxygen source and mask
• Bag valve mask device (Ambubag)
• Laryngeal mask airway
• Intubating equipment
• Intraosseous needle
• Intravenous cannula, IV fluids
• Suction
• Pulse oximeter
• Nebulizer.

Common Initial Interventions
Once the critically ill child is recognized, do not waste time in
detailed investigations and diagnosis.
Do the following regardless of diagnosis:
• Start oxygen
• If respiratory distress
{{ Ensure airway open by head tilt, chin lift, jaw thrust
{{ If not maintainable, intubate
{{ If cannot intubate, ventilate with bag and mask.
{{ If cannot intubate or ventilate, then use laryngeal mask
airway and call the best expert in airway management.

•

•
•
•
•
•

Anticonvulsants: if convulsions, use diazepam IV/rectal,
lorazepam, or midazolamiv (caution: respiratory depres­
sion/arrest)
{{ Phenytoin/phenobarbitone intravenously
Fever control
Analgesics, if severe pain: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
agents/narcotics as necessary
Antiemetics: if vomiting
Antiallergics: if allergic reaction/anaphylaxis
Subcutaneous adrenaline, antihistaminics, steroids.

Transport
After initial stabilization and ensuring airway, breathing,
and circulation under reasonable control with established IV
access, transfer/transport to a higher-level facility needs to be
arranged.

Clinical Pearls
• Cardiac arrest can be prevented in most children if respiratory
distress is assessed and treated
• Early rapid cardiopulmonary assessment saves life
• Fluid therapy and antibiotic dose alone can do 80% of the job
in a septic child.

Foreign Body Obstruction
If known foreign body obstruction:
• Then back blows, chest thrust, and Heimlich maneuver
• Nebulize as required (adrenaline or b2 stimulant).
Monitor oxygen saturation if pulse oximeter is available.

Shock
Establish intravenous/intraosseous access.
• Do not waste more than 90 seconds trying for intravenous
access or wasting time with attempting to place a central
line
• Intraosseous access can be used in all age groups
• Push fluid bolus 20 mL/kg up to 60–80 mL/kg of isotonic
fluid (Normal saline/Ringers lactate).
After each intervention, reassess airway breathing and
circulation (capillary refill, color, heart rate, pulse, blood
pressure, mental status, urine output).

Septic Shock
Vikram Gagneja, Praveen Khilnani

INTRODUCTION
Severe sepsis or septic shock remains a major cause of
morbidity and mortality among children, mainly due to
acute hemodynamic compromise and associated multiple
organ dysfunctions. Emphasis has been on early recognition
and early goal-directed therapy of severe sepsis and septic
shock by means of aggressive fluid resuscitation (somewhat
guarded in malnourished children), use of catecholamines,
early antibiotics, and other adjuvant drugs, widely considered
of pivotal importance to improve the short- and long-term
outcome of these patients. Severe sepsis (septic shock) is
defined as sepsis plus sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or
tissue hypoperfusion (Boxes 1 and 2) as per Surviving Sepsis
Campaign 2012. Sepsis-induced hypotension is defined as
blood pressure less than two standard deviation below normal
for age with no other causes of hypotension. Normal ranges for
pediatric age group are given in table 1.

MANAGEMENT
Airway, Breathing, and Circulation
Patient should be given 100% oxygen by facemask if airway
is maintainable or high flow nasal cannula/nasopharyngeal
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if there is
increase work of breathing to maintain their functional
residual capacity. The decision to intubate and ventilate is
based on clinical assessment of increased work of breathing,
hypoventilation, or impaired mental status. Waiting for
confirmatory laboratory tests is discouraged. However, during
intubation and mechanical ventilation, increased intrathoracic
pressure and drugs used for sedation can reduce venous return
and lead to worsening shock if the patient is not adequately
volume-loaded. Mechanical ventilation should be done using
lung protective strategies (tidal volume 4–6 mL/kg of ideal
body weight, plateau pressure ≤30). Appropriate sedation

Any of the is following thought to be due to infection:
• Sepsis-induced hypotension
• Lactate above upper limits laboratory normal
• Urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 2 h despite adequate
fluid resuscitation
• Acute lung injury with PaO2/FiO2 <250 in the absence of
pneumonia as infection source
• Acute lung injury with PaO2/FiO2 <200 in the presence of
pneumonia as infection source
• Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL (176.8 μmol/L)
• Bilirubin >2 mg/dL (34.2 μmol/L)
• Platelet count <100,000 μL
• Coagulopathy (international normalized ratio >1.5)

and analgesia should be provided to a patient on mechanical
ventilation.
Getting intravenous access may be difficult early in the
course of shock especially in small children, rapid use of
intraosseous access should be utilized which can be used
to give any type of medication. Time should not be wasted
in attaining central line. Rapid fluid boluses of 20 mL/kg
(isotonic crystalloid or colloids) can be administered by push
or rapid infusion device (pressure bag) while observing for
signs of fluid overload (i.e., the development of increased
work of breathing, rales, gallop rhythm or hepatomegaly). In
the absence of these clinical findings, repeated fluid boluses
can be administered. Children commonly require 40–60 mL/
kg in the first hour (some children may require 180–200 mL/
kg). Each fluid bolus should be followed by quick assessment
of clinical parameters like improvement in heart rate as per age
(Table 1), capillary refill time (CRT) (normal CRT <2 s), normal
pulses with no differential between peripheral and central

pulses, normal blood pressure for age, sensorium, and urine
output. Thereafter, central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)
greater than or equal to 70% and cardiac index between 3.3
and 6.0 L/min/m2 should be targeted, if facilities for such
monitoring are available. Fluid responsiveness techniques can
be applied wherein fluid administration is continued as long as
there is hemodynamic improvement either based on dynamic
(e.g., change in pulse pressure, stroke volume variation) or
static (e.g., arterial pressure, heart rate) variables. Noninvasive
measures, such as echocardiography, may be utilized to assess
for adequacy of fluid resuscitation by assessing inferior vena
cava collapse.

Fluid Refractory Shock
If despite of 60 mL/kg of fluid, therapeutics endpoints like
CRT less than 2 seconds, threshold heart rates, normal pulses
with no differential between the quality of the peripheral and
central pulses, warm extremities, urine output more than
1 mL/kg/hour, normal mental status, and blood pressure more
than fifth centile for age are not met, shock is defined as fluid
refractory and child should be shifted to pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) for further monitoring. Vasoactive drugs
can be started through peripheral or intraosseous line till the
central line is established. Shock is further defined into warm
or cold shock, catecholamine resistant, and refractory shock as
shown in table 2. Further management of septic shock in PICU
is guided as per algorithm 1.

Antibiotics and Source Control
Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered early
preferably within first hour of therapy after taking appropriate
cultures but should not delay therapy, as each passing hour
increase chances of mortality. Antimicrobials can be given

Algorithm for time sensitive, goal-directed stepwise management of hemodynamic support in infants and children. Proceed to next step
if shock persists. 1) First hour goals—Restore and maintain heart rate thresholds, capillary refill ≤2 seconds, and normal blood pressure in
the first hour/emergency department. Support oxygenation and ventilation as appropriate. 2) Subsequent intensive care unit goals—If
shock is not reversed, intervene to restore and maintain normal perfusion pressure (mean arterial pressure-central venous pressure) for
age, central venous oxygen saturation >70%, and CI >3.3, <6.0 L/min/m2 in pediatric intensive care unit.

intramuscularly or orally (if tolerated) until intravenous
line access is available. Antibiotics should be chosen based
on suspected community acquired or hospital-acquired
infection, local resistance pattern of organism, site of infection,
and whether immune-compromised or immune-competent
and past history of chronic illness. The choice of empiric drugs
should also take into consideration the ongoing epidemic and
endemic (e.g., H1N1, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, chloroquine-resistant malaria, and penicillin-resistant
pneumococci). Clindamycin, to decrease toxin production

Ch-41.indd 197

and intravenous immunoglobulin in refractory toxic shock
syndrome may be considered. Any site of localized pus
collection or any other source of infection should be taken care
of once child is stable enough for procedure. Antibiotics may
de-escalated later according to culture sensitivity report.

Steroid Therapy
If a child is at risk of suspected or proven absolute adrenal
insufficiency (random cortisol level <18 µg/dL) or adrenal
pituitary axis failure (e.g., purpura fulminans, congenital

197

11/19/2016 2:58:10 PM

Section 5: Intensive Care
adrenal hyperplasia, prior recent steroid exposure, hypo­
thalamic/pituitary abnormality) and remains in shock despite
epinephrine or norepinephrine infusion, then hydrocortisone
can be administered. Hydrocortisone may be administered as
an intermittent or continuous infusion (preferable in view of
decrease incidence of hyperglycemia and hyponatremia) at
a dosage of 50 mg/m2/24 h titrated to reversal of shock and
tapered once vasopressor support is not required.

Glycemic Control
Hypoglycemia should be prevented by providing appropriate
glucose delivery rate to the child. Associations have been
reported between hyperglycemia and an increased risk of
death and longer length of hospital stay. Two consecutives
values of more than or equal to 180 mg/dL should be
managed with insulin infusion in addition to glucose to avoid
hypoglycemic episodes.

Deep Vein Thrombosis and
Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis
There is no role of deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer
prophylaxis in prepubertal children with severe sepsis.
However, stress ulcer prophylaxis is commonly used in children
who are mechanically ventilated and high risk for bleeding
with H2-blockers or proton pump inhibitors, although its effect
is not known.

Diuretics and Renal Replacement Therapy
Fluid overload in severe sepsis has been associated with
increased risk of mortality, so effort to reverse fluid overload
with diuretics when shock has resolved and if unsuccessful,
then continuous venovenous hemofiltration or intermittent
dialysis to prevent greater than 10% of total body weight fluid
overload has met with improved survival in severe sepsis.

Blood Products and Plasma Therapies

Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation

Packed cell transfusion may be given to maintain hemoglobin
of 10 gm/dL if child is hemodynamically unstable (ScvO2 <70%
during resuscitation) and target of 7–9 g/dL is reasonable
after stabilization and recovery from shock and hypoxemia.
Fresh-frozen plasma may be used as infusion not as bolus,
if international normalized ratio is prolonged and bleeding
tendency is present. In patients with severe sepsis, platelets
be administered prophylactically when counts are less
than or equal to 10,000/mm3 (10 × 109/L) in the absence of
apparent bleeding, as well when counts are less than or equal
to 20,000/mm3 (20 × 109/L) if the patient has a significant
risk of bleeding. Higher platelet counts (≥50,000/mm3 [50 ×
109/L]) are advised for active bleeding, surgery or invasive
procedures.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used to
support children and neonates with septic shock or sepsisassociated respiratory failure. The survival of septic patients
supported with ECMO is 73% for newborns and 39% for older
children, and is highest in those receiving venovenous ECMO.
Forty-one percent of children with a diagnosis of sepsis
requiring ECMO for respiratory failure survive to hospital
discharge. Venoarterial ECMO is also useful in children
with refractory septic shock, with one center reporting 74%
survival to hospital discharge using central cannulation via
sternotomy. ECMO has been used successfully in critically ill
H1N1 pediatric patients with refractory respiratory failure.

Nutrition

Optimum treatment of severe sepsis or septic shock is a
dynamic and evolving process. Early diagnosis, allowing
rapid therapeutic intervention, is essential in improving the
outcome of these patients. Current treatment includes early
fluid resuscitation, early appropriate antibiotics, tailored use of
inotropes and vasopressors, lung protective strategy for acute
respiratory distress syndrome, and use of adjuvant treatments
such as low-dose hydro­cortisone (Table 5). Early recognition
of organ failure and supportive therapy especially renal
replacement therapy to prevent further injury helps in reversal
of organ dysfunction.

Providing early enteral nutrition to maintain gut integrity and
to prevent gut translocation of bacteria should be the goal
once hemodynamic stability is achieved. Partial or complete
total parenteral nutrition can be given, where enteral feeding
cannot be established.

Protein C and Activated Protein Concentrate
No benefit of recombinant human activated protein C in
patients with septic shock.

CONCLUSION

Table 5: Summary of pediatric recommendations of surviving sepsis guidelines 2012
A. Initial resuscitation

198

• For respiratory distress and hypoxemia, start with face mask oxygen, or if needed and available, high flow
nasal cannula oxygen or nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure. For improved circulation,
peripheral intravenous access or intraosseous access can be used for fluid resuscitation and inotrope infusion
when a central line is not available. If mechanical ventilation is required then cardiovascular instability during
intubation is less likely after appropriate cardiovascular resuscitation
• Initial therapeutic endpoints of resuscitation of septic shock: capillary refill of ≤2 s, normal blood pressure for
age, normal pulses with no differential between peripheral and central pulses, warm extremities, urine output
>1 mL/kg/h, and normal mental status. Central venous oxygen saturation ≥70% and cardiac index between
3.3 and 6.0 L/min/m2 should be targeted thereafter

Chapter 41: Septic Shock
Continued
• Follow American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Life Support guidelines for the management of
septic shock
• Evaluate for and reverse pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, or endocrine emergencies in patients with
refractory shock
B. Antibiotics and source
control

• Empiric antibiotics be administered within 1 h of the identification of severe sepsis. Blood cultures should be
obtained before administering antibiotics when possible but this should not delay administration of antibiotics.
The empiric drug choice should be changed as epidemic and endemic ecologies dictate (e.g., H1N1, MRSA,
chloroquine resistant malaria, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, recent ICU stay, and neutropenia)
• Clindamycin and antitoxin therapies for toxic shock syndromes with refractory hypotension
• Early and aggressive source control (grade 1D)
• Clostridium difficile colitis should be treated with enteral antibiotics if tolerated. Oral vancomycin is preferred
for severe disease

C. Fluid resuscitation

• In the industrialized world with access to inotropes and mechanical ventilation, initial resuscitation of
hypovolemic shock begins with infusion of isotonic crystalloids or albumin with boluses of up to 20 mL/kg
crystalloids (or albumin equivalent ) over 5–10 minutes, titrated to reversing hypotension, increasing urine
output, and attaining normal capillary refill, peripheral pulses, and level of consciousness without inducing
hepatomegaly or rales. If hepatomegaly or rales exists then inotropic support should be implemented, not
fluid resuscitation. In nonhypotensive children with severe hemolytic anemia (severe malaria or sickle cell
crises) blood transfusion is considered superior to crystalloid or albumin bolusing

D. Inotropes/
vasopressors/
vasodilators

• Begin peripheral inotropic support until central venous access can be attained in children who are not
responsive to fluid resuscitation
• Patients with low cardiac output and elevated systemic vascular resistance states with normal blood pressure
be given vasodilator therapies in addition to inotropes

E. Extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation
(ECMO)

• Consider ECMO for refractory pediatric septic shock and respiratory failure

F. Corticosteroids

• Timely hydrocortisone therapy in children with fluid refractory, catecholamine resistant shock, and suspected
or proven absolute (classic) adrenal insufficiency

G. Protein C and activated No recommendation as no longer available
protein concentrate
H. Blood products and
plasma therapies

• Similar hemoglobin targets in children as in adults. During resuscitation of low superior vena cava oxygen
saturation shock (<70%), hemoglobin levels of 10 g/dL are targeted. After stabilization and recovery from
shock and hypoxemia, a lower target >7.0 g/dL can be considered reasonable
• Platelet transfusion targets as described in text
• Use plasma therapies in children to correct sepsis-induced thrombotic purpura disorders, including
progressive disseminated intravascular coagulation, secondary thrombotic microangiopathy, and thrombotic
thrombo­cytopenic purpura

I. Mechanical ventilation

• Lung-protective strategies during mechanical ventilation

J. Sedation/analgesia/
drug toxicities

• We recommend use of sedation with a sedation goal in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis
• Monitor drug toxicity labs because drug metabolism is reduced during severe sepsis, putting children at
greater risk of adverse drug-related events

K. Glycemic control

• Control hyperglycemia using a similar target as in adults ≤180 mg/dL. Glucose infusion should accompany
insulin therapy in newborns and children because some hyperglycemic children make no insulin whereas
others are insulin resistant

L. Diuretics and renal
replacement therapy

• Use diuretics to reverse fluid overload when shock has resolved, and if unsuccessful then continuous
venovenous hemofiltration or intermittent dialysis to prevent >10% total body weight fluid overload

M. Deep vein thrombosis
prophylaxis

• No recommendation on the use of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in prepubertal children with severe
sepsis

N. Stress ulcer
prophylaxis

• No recommendation on the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis in prepubertal children with severe sepsis

O. Nutrition

• Enteral nutrition given to children who can be fed enterally, and parenteral feeding in those who cannot

Section 5: Intensive Care

Clinical Pearls
• Septic patients may have warm shock or cold shock with or
without respiratory distress
• Source control (debridement, drainage) should be considered
in all septic patients.
• Isotonic solution such as normal saline or Ringers lactate for all
initial fluid therapy
• First dose of antibiotics to be stored in outpatient department
and emergency areas
• If persistent hypotension despite fluids and inotropes, one
should look for mechanical causes, such as tamponade due to
raised intra-abdominal pressure, pleural or pericardial effusion,
or tension pneumothorax.

Status Epilepticus
Soonu Udani

INTRODUCTION
Status Epilepticus (SE) is a brain damaging emergency that
needs prompt and targeted therapy in a protocolised manner
if good outcome is to be expected. Several algorithms may be
available and units must make one most suitable for their
setting.

DEFINITION
A seizure is a paroxysmal change in motor activity and or
behavior that results from abnormal electrical activity in the
brain. There are several proposed definitions for SE.
The classic one is: seizures or repeated seizures lasting for more
than 30 minutes without recovering consciousness between
seizures.
Recent definition states: status greater than 5 minutes or a
continuous seizures or two or more discrete seizure between
which there is incomplete recovery of consciousness.
For practical purposes: any child that is brought convulsing to
the hospital is said to be in SE.
Defining status in this way allows us to recognize short
lasting seizures as relatively benign events not necessarily
requiring emergent treatment and gives us strong grounds to
treat longer lasting seizures aggressively as true emergencies
necessitating strong pharmacologic intervention.

MANAGEMENT OF status epilepticus
Current management of SE emphasizes a more aggressive
approach—initiating first line therapy more rapidly (the longer
one waits the longer the seizure takes to come under control).
If the patient is out of hopistal, has no intravenous access,
or casualty, consider buccal midazolam 0.3 mg/kg or rectal
diazepam 0.3 mg/kg.
1. Intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines: early use gives best
results

Ch-42.indd 201

•

Lorazepam, 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum, 5 mg) over 1 min,
(diazepam can be substituted)
• Allow 5 minutes to determine whether seizure
terminates
• Give oxygen; stabilize airway, respiration, and hemo­
dynamics as needed
• Obtain IV access
• Check bedside glucose
• Begin electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring
• Repeat benzodiazepine administration.
2. Administer fosphenytoin (PHT) 20 mg/kg phenytoin
equivalent IV at 2–3 mg/kg/min (maximum, 150 mg/min)
(phenytoin needs to be given slower) (Phenobarbitone at
20 mg/kg can be substituted here)
• If the patient’s age is less than 2 years, consider
pyridoxine 100 mg IV push
• Testings:
{{ Bedside glucose complete blood count cultures
{{ Electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus,
liver function test, and toxicology if indicated
(serum, urine preserve till consultant orders)
{{ Antiepileptic drug (AED) levels, prothrombin time,
thromboplastin time
{{ Support airway, respiration, hemodynamics as
needed
{{ Continuous vital sign and ECG monitoring.
3. If seizures persist for more than 10 min, repeat dose of PHT
10–20 mg/kg; wait for 10 min if still have seizures
This is now the stage of established SE as two primary drugs
have failed.
4. Administer levetiracetam (LEV) 20 mg/kg IV at 5 mg/kg/
min (maximum 3 g), continue at 40 mg/kg/day in two to
three divided doses.
If contraindication to LEV and no specific concern regarding
liver/metabolic/mitochondrial disease, then administer:
• Valproate (VPA) 30 mg/kg at 5 mg/kg/min
OR

11/19/2016 2:59:36 PM

Section 5: Intensive Care
•

Phenobarbital (PB) 20 mg/kg over 5–10 min.
If seizures persist after 10 min, established RSE and admit
to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
In patients who had failed first line therapy, additional
second and third line therapy adds only marginal benefit (2.3–
5%). Given the observation that intermediate steps are time
consuming with limited added value and also with increased
awareness of the importance of early treatment of seizure, a
change to accelerated protocol has been proposed. Lorazepam
and phenytoin are given simultaneously, followed by
pharmacologic coma (omit phenobarbitone). The application
of such treatment has to be balanced with available expertise
and infrastructure.
Prepare to secure airway, mechanically ventilate, and
obtain central venous access and continuous hemodynamic
monitoring through an arterial line.
5. Initiate coma with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg bolus (maximum
10 mg) over 2 minutes, and then initiate infusion at 0.1 mg/
kg/h.
If seizures persist for five more minutes after an additional
midazolam bolus of 0.2 mg/kg bolus, increase the dose by 0.02
every 5–10 minutes.
One or two extra boluses can be given but they should not
be repeated for every increase in infusion rate.
The patient would almost always need intubation and
ventilatory support by now. Vasopressor support with
norepinephrine (NE) by the central line should be considered
If seizures persist at maximum midazolam (generally
2 mg/kg/h) or midazolam infusion or till hypotension, cardiac
instability is seen.
If seizures still persist, with reassessment of cardio­
vascular status, which may include an echocardiography for
contractility, the next step should be pentobarbital coma.
An electroencephalogram (EEG)—preferably continuous—
should be obtained at this stage, especially if no clinical seizure
activity is visible.
6. Thiopental 4 mg/kg load and 1–2 mg/kg/h
• Increase only on advice of consultant and EEG for burst
suppression
• Warning: cardiodepressive; especially after 3–4 days of
continuous use
• Propofol is another option however, it is not approved
in children for use for more than 24 h
• General anesthesia requires the expertise of an
anesthetist and the machine for gas delivery; most
PICUs are ill-equipped for the system.
7. Weaning: after a minimum of 24 hours of electrical seizurefree activity, reduce midazolam by 0.05 mg/kg/h every 3
hour, with frequent EEG review.
Similar weaning should be done for thiopental, unless
abrupt stoppage is required because of severe hypotension
uncontrolled by NE. Hypotension will reduce cerebral
perfusion pressure and aggravate central nervous injury.
If clinical or subclinical seizures occur, reinstitute coma
with midazolam for 24 hours. Similarly for thiopental.

202

Ch-42.indd 202

Note: Midazolam does not cause burst suppression, the end point is
loss of seizure activity.

Algorithm 1
Algorithm of seizure

IV, intravenous; IO, intraosseous; PICU, pediatric intensive care unit.

If no clinical or electrographic seizures, then wean off.
The patient should be monitored for levels of PB, PHT, and
VPA when used. The child would be on two to three AEDs by
now and these should not be stopped immediately. The rest of
the management would depend on the cause and recovery.
Magnetic resonance imaging and etiology seeking tests (as
in encephalopathy) should be performed even with the patient
on ventilation.
When the patient does not respond, other advanced
therapies may be called for which are beyond this discussion.

Clinical Pearls
• Prolonged status injures the brain
• Accelerated protocol saves 20–30 minutes
• Treat within the facility’s capabilities and transfer early.

Cardiogenic Shock
Nameet Jerath, Praveen Khilnani

INTRODUCTION
Children with congenital heart disease, cardio­
myopathy,
various arrhythmias, viral myocardititis,post cardiac surgery
or severe sepsis can have severe myocardial dysfunction and
cardiogenic shock. It is a commonly encountered problem
in pediatric age group and early diagnosis and initiation
of treatment can prevent mortality and severe morbidity.
This chapter covers algorhithmic approach to a child with
cardiogenic shock with systematic differential diagnosis and
broad management of various etiologies leading to cardiogenic
shock.

DEFINITION
Shock is a state of imbalance between the metabolic supply and
demands of the body. Cardiogenic shock is the subset when the
cardiac function is responsible for the failure of cardiovascular
system to meet the metabolic demands of the body.
Shock on presentation has similar signs and symptoms, like
tachycardia, tachypnea, poor perfusion, and decreased urine
output with or without drop in blood pressure (hypotension),
and it may be impossible to identify shock to be cardiogenic on
presentation.
The initial management of any child who presents with
shock, irrespective of the etiology, remains the same. The aim
is quick identification of shock status and an early appropriate
response to improve outcomes.
Cardiac function can be depressed in patients with any type
of shock, even of noncardiac origin. Myocardial dysfunction
could be responsible for worsening of shock state as in massive
sepsis. We shall restrict ourselves to only the cardiac causes of
cardiogenic shock in this chapter (Algorithm 1).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
It pays to remember the determinants of substrate delivery to
the tissues (Algorithm 2). Cardiac output is dependent on heart

Ch-43.indd 204

rate (HR) and stroke volume, and the stroke volume itself is
dependent on preload, contractility, and afterload of the heart.
The oxygen content of blood is dependent on the
hemoglobin concentration and its oxygen saturation (SpO2).
Preload, contractility, afterload, hemoglobin, SpO2, and to
some extent, HR can be optimized with drugs or other inter­
ventions and help tilting the metabolic balance back to normal.
As the shock progresses, body’s compensatory mecha­nisms,
like increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and HR start
to kick in. These compensatory responses can be detrimental
and can worsen the cardiogenic shock by increasing afterload
and worsening cardiac output. As the critical point is reached,
patient can switch from a “warm” state of adequate perfusion
to a “cold” state. Patients now show signs of poor cardiac
output and are tachycardic, hypotensive, diaphoretic, oliguric,
acidotic, and poorly perfused. Extremities are cool and mental
status is altered. Hepatomegaly, jugular venous distension,
rales, and peri­pheral edema may be observed.

Diastolic Dysfunction
Diastolic dysfunction is poorly understood and often over­
looked. It can be associated with normal systolic ventricular
function. Impaired myocardial relaxation during diastole
increases left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). This
is transmitted to the lung and results in pulmonary edema and
dyspnea. Elevated LVEDP reduces the perfusion pressure in
the coronaries which further hampers cardiac perfusion and
function.

Recognition of Cardiogenic Shock
There are often subtle clues to suggest that the shock could be
cardiogenic and it is important to identify such patients, as their
management plan would differ from the routine management
of shock.
Though there are often overlap of symptoms with other
noncardiogenic conditions, the following symptoms should
alert one to the possibility of cardiogenic origin of shock:

Often clues towards cardiogenic shock can be found
on careful monitoring and trend of vitals and response to
interventions during resuscitation. The response to a fluid
bolus should be improvement of the HR and improvement
in blood pressure as the venous return [and central venous
pressure (CVP)] improves. Contrary to expectation, if the HR
starts rising and/or the blood pressure drops in response to
a fluid bolus, one should be alerted and cautiously review
the scenario. Excessive and too fast fluid bolus in a child with
cardiogenic shock could worsen the hemodynamic state. Such
children may still be hypovolemic and require fluid boluses but
these should be slower and in smaller aliquots. The importance
of assessment and reassessment after each intervention cannot
be overemphasized.

Causes of Cardiogenic Shock

{{

•

Arrhythmias: supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), arrhy­
thmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
• Myocarditis/cardiomyopathy: hypoxia, infectious, meta­
bolic, toxic, neuromuscular disorders
• Congenital heart diseases
• Postoperative low cardiac output state (LCOS)
• Trauma.
Neonatal period undergoes significant transitions in
pulmonary and systemic circulations immediately to a
few weeks after birth. Congenital heart diseases with duct
dependent circulations can present dramatically with collapse.
Any newborn who presents in shock should be suspected to
have a duct dependent circulation.
Congenital heart diseases are a significant group of patients
who can present in shock. A chest X-ray can help group them
into either well, overly or poorly perfused lung fields. Lesions
with generous pulmonary blood flows (like large ventricular
septal defect) present with tachypnea and respiratory distress
and need measures to restrict the pulmonary blood flow.

Investigations
After initial stabilization, laboratory investigations that may
be ordered include complete blood count, arterial blood
gas, electrolytes including ionized calcium, renal and liver
functions, serum lactate, and cardiac enzymes if indicated.
Once a central venous line is in place, measurement of
central venous oxygen saturation (CVO2) is a good marker of
cardiac output. Central venous oxygen saturation measured
from superior vena cava reflects the adequacy of oxygen
delivery, and therefore, cardiac output (Fick’s Principle).

Chest Radiography
The chest radiograph should be evaluated for the size of heart
and pulmonary vasculature, both of which provide essential
information regarding the possible causes of shock.

Electrocardiography
An electrocardiogram can be diagnostic in certain conditions
like anomalous origin of left coronary artery from pulmonary
artery. The rhythm on the monitor should be carefully assessed.
Long-standing SVT, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation,
or atrioventricular block could be the reason of shock.

Echocardiography
This is the most effective way of a comprehensive assess­ment of
cardiac structure and function. It also helps in the calculation
of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance index. A
quick, limited assessment should be in the armamentarium of
each critical care specialist.
More specialized tests, like cardiac catheterization or
magnetic resonance imaging, are sometimes needed for
detailed assessment and management of certain conditions.

Management

General Measures
The initial management of shock remains the same as outlined
in the guidelines elsewhere, as many times it is impossible
to discern the cause of shock on presentation. The history,
clinical features, and response to resuscitation efforts often
have enough clues to primary cardiac involvement. Once
cardiogenic shock has been identified, the management
should be tailored to the suspected condition.
Fluid boluses should be carefully given in small aliquots of
5–10 mL/kg. Most children will have concomitant dehydration
too because of poor oral intake, respiratory losses, and
sometimes associated diarrhea and vomiting, and will benefit
from fluid boluses. At any stage, if the desired hemodynamic
response is not seen, no more fluid boluses should be
administered.
Maintain normal sugar levels, temperature, and a calm
state by judicious use of sedation to reduce the metabolic
demands of the body. The electrolytes including magnesium
and calcium should be normalized.
Ventilation should be thought of early in patients with
cardiogenic shock. It has the advantages of reducing metabolic
demands of the body by reducing the work of breathing,
allowing sedation and muscle relaxation, and by reducing
afterload. Ventilated patients should be targeted to normal pH
and CO2 with adequate oxygenation.
Monitoring is a vital part of management of cardiogenic
shock. Most such children will require invasive arterial
pressure monitoring and central venous lines for CVP and for
infusion of vasoactive drugs.

CARDIOGENIC SHOCK IN A NEWBORN
The newborn period presents a specific subgroup as this is a
period of transition from fetal to extrauterine circulation. Many
duct dependent lesions can present with dramatic shock with
the closure of the patent ductus arteriosus. All circulatory
shocks in newborns should be treated as duct dependent
lesion unless proven otherwise and efforts should be targeted
to keep the duct patent by PGE1 infusion (0.05–0.1 mg/kg/min).

Preload
Preload assessment and titrating fluid management can be very
challenging. The idea is to optimize preload to help the cardiac
output by shifting up on the Frank-Starling curve. Judicious small
volume fluid boluses are recommended, sometimes as small as
5 mL/kg with subsequent fluid being guided by hemodynamic
response. Crystalloids remain the fluid of choice.

11/19/2016 3:02:13 PM

Chapter 43: Cardiogenic Shock
In a fluid overloaded child with stable blood pressure,
diuretics may be judiciously used later on in the course of the
management.

Myocardial Contractility, Inotropic Agents
The choice of vaso-cardioactive drugs will depend on the
clinical state and no one prescription fits all.
Dopamine and adrenaline are good inotropic agents and
increase the contractile force of the heart pump and increase
the SVR. They thus increase the cardiac output and the blood
pressure. Both also increase the metabolic demands of the
heart.
Dobutamine and milrinone are inodilators that improve
the pump function and also cause dilation of systemic vessels
[reduced SVR and hence blood pressure (BP)]. The combined
effects of improved contractility and reduction in afterload
improves cardiac output albeit with some drop in BP. Milrinone
and to smaller extent dobutamine has excellent lusitropic
effect, which allows for relaxation of heart, improving the
diastolic dysfunction.
Noradrenaline and vasopressin are primarily vaso­
constrictors and their use alone in a failing heart is not
appropriate. They both increase blood pressure but with
increased workload (afterload) for the heart. They can help
improve coronary perfusion.

Vasoactive Drugs
The clinical effects and recommended doses of few vasoactive
drugs are given in table 1.

should be avoided as monotherapy in acute early phase of
shock due to the risk of uncontrolled hypotension. They are
sometimes used together with an inotrope.

SPECIFIC THERAPY
Intravenous immunoglobulin is often used in patients with
myocarditis to modulate the immune response. There is not
enough literature support for this practice though.
Postoperative LCOS is the state of low cardiac output after
cardiac surgeries because of many factors including tissue
edema, cytokine release, cardiac stun, etc. This needs careful
monitoring and management on the lines described above.
Most carefully managed hearts will start showing improvement
in about 48 hours.

Surgical Correction
Some congenital heart diseases may need urgent surgical
correction. Cardiac lesions with torrential pulmonary blood
flow benefit from pulmonary artery banding procedures.

Extracorporeal Cardiac Support
Cardiogenic shock refractory to the above mentioned therapies
can be supported on extracorporeal support systems, like
ventricular assist devices (e.g., Berlin Heart, Thoratec) or
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These are used as
temporary measures while awaiting spontaneous recovery or
as a bridge to transplant.

CARDIAC TRANSPLANT

Diastolic Blood Pressure
The left heart gets its perfusion through coronary arteries
during diastole across a pressure gradient (diastolic blood
pressure–LVEDP). Maintenance of adequate diastolic blood
pressure is, therefore, necessary to maintain the coronary
perfusion to fuel the heart.

Afterload Reduction

Heart transplant is the last option for refractory and terminal
heart failure. Organ supply remains the biggest hurdle in our
country for this option to be exercised.

Clinical Pearls
• Cardiogenic shock in children can present as respiratory distress

Positive end expiratory pressure in a child with adequate
venous filling has the effects of reducing afterload making
it easier for the heart to pump. This, amongst others, is an
important reason to consider early ventilation of such children.
Inodilators (dobutamine, milrinone, amrinone) or pure
vasodilators (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine) will reduce
afterload and may be used to augment cardiac output. They

• Newborns cardiogenic shock due to congenital heart disease
present when ductus closes, as a corollary prostaglandin drip
to keep ductus open may be life-saving
• Metabolic/endocrine problems, such as hypoglycemia, hypo­
calcemia, and hypothyroidism, can present as cardiogenic shock
• Septic shock is an important cause of cardiogenic shock.

Head Injury in
Infants and Children
Bhaskar Saikia, Praveen Khilnani

INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury in children is prevalent universally with
potentially poor outcomes. Domestic accidents, motor vehicle
accidents, recreational injuries, and sports mishaps are the
common causes; however, child abuse must be kept in mind
in children, especially in toddlers. The reported mortality in
developed countries in hospital setting is 9–35%.
The incidence in developing countries is poorly docu­
mented, however, mortality is higher in developing countries.
Primary brain injury is the direct result of the physical
trauma. It may result in uncomplicated concussion with quick
recovery and no residual deficit or in serious hemorrhage,
contusion or hematomas. While these are all visible on a
computed tomography (CT) scan, diffuse axonal injury can
be a severe condition where the initial CT scan may look
deceptively benign. Secondary brain injury may occur after
the primary event due to potentially preventable causes like
hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hypercarbia, and hematoma.

MANAGEMENT
Management of head injury and control of intracranial
pressure (ICP) (Algorithm 1) or maintenance of cerebral
perfusion pressure (CPP) is to be started right from the site
of accident to include prevention of hypotension by active
control of bleeding and fluid therapy. Immediate stabilization
of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) with cervical
spine immobilization should be done followed by detailed
evaluation of the following:
• Mode of injury
• Time of injury
• Neurological condition of the child
• Seizures may occur immediately or soon after the injury.
Loss of consciousness of more than 5 minutes warrants
imaging and evaluation. Recovery from early loss of conscious­
ness with a secondary lapse may be indicative of extradural
hematoma.
Vomiting after even trivial head injury is not uncommon in
children, but observation for this is usually advisable.

Ch-44.indd 209

Neurological deficit may be transient after an impact such
as a short seizure. If the child presents with coma, deficit cannot
be assessed, a previous observation by parents or doctor is
noted and needs to be followed closely.
The AVPU (Alert, Responds to Verbal commands, Responds to
pain, Unresponsive) scale can provide valuable information.

Glasgow Coma Scale
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to assess the depth of
coma after head injury in adults and children above 5 years
of age. In those below 5 years, modified GCS should be used
(Table 1).
Classification of head injury using GCS
• 13–15: mild
• 9–12: moderate
• 3–8: severe.
Clinical criteria for discharge from emergency room after 2
hours of observation:
• No loss of consciousness
• No vomiting
• No amnesia
• Normal mental status
• No focal neurological deficit
• No neurological deterioration
• No post-traumatic seizure including impact seizure
• No otorrhea or rhinorrhea or bleeding
• No shock or other organ involvement that would preclude
discharge
• No anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory drug, or bleeding
diathesis
• No suspicion of child abuse, no matter how trivial the injury
• Radiological criteria for minor head injury
• No intracranial abnormality related to the head injury on
CT scan.
Skull fractures are acceptable except:
• Those that cross the middle meningeal artery
• Those that cross the dural sinuses
• Those that are depressed more than the thickness of the
adjacent skull.

In children fulfilling the above criteria for minor head
injury, delayed deterioration is extremely uncommon and can
be safely discharged. All other patient should be admitted.

Care upon Admission

210

Tracheal intubation is indicated for children with GCS ≤8.
Children with multi-trauma, inhalation injury, airway/facial
injury, and shock with inaccessible head injury should be
intubated, especially if at risk for increased ICP from pain and
agitation. The cervical spine must be protected.
Pain, fever, and retention of urine should be treated
immediately. Constrictive cervical collar or large-bore internal
jugular catheter should be avoided. Supine position with the
head end elevated to 30° is preferred for adequate venous

Ch-44.indd 210

drainage. All unnecessary touch, rough handling, moving,
and noise should be controlled or kept to minimum. Severe
hyperglycemia greater than 180 mg/dL and hypoglycemia
should be avoided.
Orotracheal intubation is preferred as it is quicker,
requiring less manipulation of the neck, avoids aggravating any
anterior basilar skull fracture, or introducing infection into the
anterior cranial vault.
All patients should be presumed to be full stomach. The
jaw thrust maneuver is used during bag mask ventilation and
head tilt and chin lift maneuver should be avoided. Common
medications used during intubation include thiopentone
and lidocaine. It should be emphasized that even comatose
patients must have good sedation and muscle relaxant during
intubation to avoid sudden rise in ICP.

It is not necessary to repeat a scan after 24–48 hours if there
is no clinical deterioration or change in the GCS.
A quick cross table lateral X-ray can help to visualize at least
the top three vertebrae. Cervical spine should also be scanned
during the CT head to avoid repeated radiation exposure.
Other associated injuries should be ruled out and should
be treated simultaneously if required. The following conditions
warrant early surgical intervention:
• Acute extra-axial hematomas of 1 cm or more in thickness
• Subdural or epidural hematomas of more than 5 mm in
thickness with midline shift
• Hematomas more than 5 mm with midline shift in patients
with moderate brain injury with effacement of the basal
cisterns
• Depressed skull fractures.
Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea need
conservative approach avoiding packing of ears and nose.
Almost all cases resolve spontaneously over 7–10 days.
Cerebrospinal fluid leaks less likely to heal are:
• Developing after days or weeks
• Postsurgical repair or accidental trauma
• Massive leaks immediately after surgery
• Gunshot injury
• With normal CSF pressure.
Antibiotic prophylaxis remains controversial.

Intracranial Pressure

Hypotension is common and blood loss should never be
attributed to the head injury alone.
A diligent search should be made for the source of bleeding.
Scalp and head trauma can cause hypotension only in
children below 2 years of age. Rapid and aggressive treatment is
needed to prevent secondary damage from hypoxic-ischemic
injury. A low blood pressure at the time of presentation is
associated with poor prognosis. Hypotension of neurogenic
origin is rare and indicates severe brainstem or cervical spine
injury. Hypertension as part of Cushing’s triad—hypertension,
bradycardia, and hypoventilation—are more common. This
indicates raised ICP. Hypertension may mask hypovolemia,
therefore, blood pressure measurement alone should not be
accepted as a sign of normovolemia. Normal saline is the best
choice for initial resuscitation.

Intracranial vault is a closed compartment—although with
some potential for expansion in the infant, follows the MonroKellie doctrine hypothesis. Intracranial pressure should be
monitored in facilities are available. Brief increases in ICP for
less than 5 minutes are not associated with significant damage.
Sustained increases of more than 20 mmHg that do not return
to base line in 5 minutes probably require attention. Most of the
evidences in adults and children set the acceptable high ICP
level at 20 mmHg. In a study by Esparza, an ICP more than 40
mmHg was associated with a 100% mortality and those between
20–40 mmHg had a 28% mortality, and with 0–20 mmHg had
7% mortality or disability. The current recommendation is to
keep the ICP less than 20 mmHg.

Radiological Investigations

This is the critical determinant of cerebral blood flow (CBF)
and brain perfusion. It is defined as the difference between
mean arterial pressure and the ICP. Studies showing outcomes
at various CPP levels confirm that a higher CPP level usually
above 60 mmHg is associated with worse outcome. However,
there does not seem to be difference of outcome in 40–60
mmHg. Guidelines for the acute medical management of severe
traumatic brain injury in infants, children, and adolescents
(2012) recommended CPP of 40 mmHg as the threshold for
infants and younger children and 50 mmHg for older children.

There is no real role for skull X-ray in head injury as far as
prognostication or severity of injury is concerned. Normal
ultrasound cranium in an infant may give false sense of
security as it will miss details. Computed tomography scan is
very helpful and threshold should be low for ordering a CT in
patients with:
• Any focal deficit
• Any history of loss of consciousness more than 5 minutes
• GCS persistent less than 13
• Unable to examine the patient because of sedation,
paralysis, or intubation for other reasons
• Pupillary inequality
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak
• Depressed skull fracture
• Vomiting more than three times.

Cerebral Perfusion Pressure

Monitoring Devices
Intraventricular catheter, intrap­
arenchymal pressure trans­
ducer, and subdural bolt can be used as invasive devices
and transcranial Doppler can be used as noninvasive device.
Advanced monitoring like jugular venous oxygenation and

212

brain tissue oxygenation are technologies measuring the
adequacy of oxygen delivery to the brain directly. Regional
oxygenation can be noninvasively measured with near infrared
spectroscopy if available.
Steroids have no benefit in head injury as the edema is
cytotoxic in nature.
Hypocapnia reduces the CBF by vasoconstriction and
hence reduces ICP. However, it will also reduce CBF to the
point of reducing CPP and cause ischemia. Hyperventilation
for a brief period of less than 10 minutes may be employed in
the setting of a sudden rise in ICP or impending herniation
preferably under ICP and CPP monitoring. The goal of therapy
is to maintain eucapnia with PaCO2 of 32–35 mmHg.
Mannitol 0.25–1 g/kg is still the most commonly used
agent by reducing the blood viscosity reduces the cerebral
vasoconstriction, improves the cerebral blood flow, and
prevents stasis. This action is immediate and last about
75 minutes. It takes 15 minutes to 6 hours for osmotic reduction
of brain water in an intact blood-brain barrier. It may also get
deposited in injured brain cells after prolonged use for less
than 48 hours, resulting in rebound edema.
Three to seven percent saline has been successfully used
in the treatment of traumatic brain injury. The hyperosmolar
state induced is more sustained and the reduction in ICP tends
to be more sustained with fewer peaks requiring intermittent
measures. The exact dosage is still unclear and bolus doses
from 6.5 mL–10 mL/kg have been advocated followed by
an infusion of 0.1–2.5 mL/kg/h. Serum sodium levels up to
160 mmol/L have been reported with no side effects. Serum
osmolarity rather than sodium level should be monitored for
effect, with a target osmolarity of 340–360 mOsm/kg. Gradual
tapering of about 10% every 6 hours is required if continuous
infusion is used for more than 48–72 hours.
Barbiturates are used for reducing the metabolic activity
of the brain, thereby its oxygen consumption. Short-acting
barbiturates like thiopentone in a loading dose of 4 mg/kg
followed by 2–4 mg/kg/h as an infusion is most commonly
used. Significant side effect includes hypotension in 54%
requiring fluids and vasopressors, anergy, pneumonia, sepsis,
and hyponatremia.
Moderate hypothermia with a core temperature of 32–34°C
may be useful but did not improve outcome in children.
A seizure does worsen ICP and the severe head injury patient
has a high incidence of early symptomatic seizure; prophylactic
medication like fosphenytoin, valproate or levetiracetam should
be administered. Seizures may occur even in minor trauma.
Immediate seizure may occur on impact or within the first 24
hours. Most seizures appear within the first 3 hours, are shortlived, generalized, and without any CT scan abnormality.
They do not predict future epilepsy, require no treatment, and
bear a good prognosis. If the seizure is complex, prolonged, or
localized, further observation and treatment is warranted.
Decompressive craniectomy may be required for severe
head injury and medically refractory intracranial hypertension
in conditions like:
• Diffuse cerebral swelling on cranial CT imaging
• Sustain ICP more than 40 mmHg before surgery
• Glasgow Coma Scale 3 at some point of subsequent to injury
• Secondary clinical deterioration
• Evolving cerebral herniation syndrome.

Ch-44.indd 212

Delayed lethargy and behavioral changes may be seen
after head injury in a child with normal CT scan and normal
neurological examination known as postconcussive syndrome.

Clinical Pearls
• Vomiting, migraine, and cortical blindness can occur with
concussion with complete recovery in most cases of closed
head injury
• Jaw thrust should be used for cervical spine protection
• Bleeding or clear fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) from ear or nose
indicates fracture base of skull
• Persistent hypotension in multitrauma patient may not be
due to head injury; look for other causes such as long bone
fracture, and abdominal bleeding due to visceral injury.

Trauma in Children
Soonu Udani

INTRODUCTION
Polytrauma is defined as trauma to more than one area of the
body and the term is usually reserved for moderate to severe
injury requiring multiple interventions; e.g., head ± orthopedics
± abdominal ± plastic surgery- and includes burns.
The length should be used for the rapid determination of
weight for appropriate drug doses and equipment size.
BE PREPARED !!!

UNIQUE ANATOMY of PEDIATRIC PATIENTS
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cranium is larger relatively → more space between brain
and bone, hence bridging veins have less support
Thinner musculature and padding, thus less protection to
organs
Ribs are more flexible, hence less dissipation of energy and
lung contusion can occur
Solid organs are comparatively larger than adults, so, less
protected by the rib cage
Kidney more mobile, hence more commonly injured
Larger surface area relative to volume predisposes children
to thermal evaporative loss. Result is hypo­thermia and
dehydration.

PRIMARY SURVEY (ALGORITHM 1)
Goals of primary survey are:
• Identify immediate/potential threats to life and initiate
treatment
• Identify the disposition of the patient (e.g., operating room,
intensive care unit, trauma facility)
• Continuous reassessment is essential.
Stabilize and transfer/triage only after the following:
• A—airway
• B—breathing
• C—circulation

Ch-45.indd 213

•
•

D—disability
E—exposure

Airway
•
•

Priority → choking will kill faster than anything else
Assess for obstruction due to position, injury, blood, teeth,
vomitus, and foreign object
{{ Level of consciousness
{{ Maxillofacial injury
{{ Stridor or cyanosis.
Hemodynamics → initial fluids: normal saline (NS).
Packed cell transfusions if hypotension persists after 2–3
boluses. Attempt to control hemorrhage by bandages.

Breathing Assessment
• Rate
• Chest wall movement: paradoxical breathing; flail segment
• Oxygen status
• Percussion note
• Tracheal deviation
• Crepitus
• Open wounds.
Management will be specific to the findings:
• Warm humidified oxygen
• Gastric decompression
• Appropriate mechanical ventilation → avoid barotrauma
and volutrauma
• Chest tube(s) if indicated.

Circulation/Hemodynamics
•
•

Blood volume = 70–90 mL/kg
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) = 70 + 2 (age in years); In
years old, will be 70 + 10 = 80 mmHg
• Diastolic blood pressure = 2/3 SBP
Pediatric vasculature readily constricts and increases
systemic vascular resistance to maintain perfusion.

Tachycardia and poor skin perfusion may be the only keys
to hypovolemia.
Hypotension in a child = decompensated shock and

bradycardia.

Circulation with Hemorrhage Control
• Heart rate (HR)
• Systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure
• Peripheral pulses
• Skin condition/perfusion/capillary refill
• Sensorium
• Potentially “deadly” bleeding checks.
After initial resuscitation done → reassess
Check for the following:
• Cervical spine must be stabilized
• Chest has to be reassessed
• Fractures long bones and pelvis
• Abdominal injuries
• Bleeding from the ear and nose
• Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) for improvement or
deterioration.

{{ Obvious exsanguination injury
{{ Initiating third bolus (10 mL/kg of type specific or
O negative warmed pRBCs).

Box 1: Structure of the pediatric airway
• Passive flexion due to large occiput → airway obstruction
• Relatively larger tongue → airway obstruction
• Mass of adenoidal tissues → nasopharyngeal (NP) airways
difficult to pass
• U-shaped, floppy epiglottis → may necessitate use of a straight
blade
• Anterior and cephalad larynx → visualization more difficult
• Airway narrowest at the cricoid ring → uncuffed tubes up to
6 mm or ~ 8 years
• Narrow tracheal diameter and distance between the rings →
needle cricothyroidotomy over surgical for a difficult airway
• Short tracheal length (4 cm NB; 8 cm toddler) → RMS intubation
and dislodgement
• More narrow large airways → greater airway resistance (R = 1/r4)

If spinal cord injury is suspected on the basis of mechanism
or clinical examination, do not be dissuaded by normal
X-rays
• A normal X-ray and initial exam is not enough
• Be aware of: local pain, torticollis.
Management:
• Avoid secondary and iatrogenic injury
• Corticosteroids are currently not recommended.

Chest and Abdomen
Pliable chest wall so lung contusions may occur without
obvious external injury.
Clinical examination improved with gastric and bladder
decompression. Clinical findings may underestimate problems.
Therefore, diagnostic adjuncts:
• Computed tomography: less sensitive for bowel, spleen,
early pancreas, liver
• Ultrasound: good for hepatic and splenic injury.
Visceral injuries specific to the pediatric population:
• Pancreatic injury
• Small bowel perforation (ligament of treitz)
• Mesenteric and small bowel avulsion
• Duodenal hematoma
• Spleen, liver, and kidney disruption
• Bladder injury.
Missed abdominal trauma is the leading cause of
preventable morbidity and mortality.
Clinical findings associated with intra-abdominal injury:
• Initial Hct less than 30%
• Abdominal tenderness
• Femur fracture
• AST more than 200 U/L and/or ALT more than 125 U/L
• Urine with more than 5 RBCs/hpf.

Section 5: Intensive Care

Indications for Surgery
•

Hemodynamic instability despite maximal resuscitative
measures +/– a positive diagnostic study
• Falling hematocrit
• Transfusion of greater than 50% of total blood volume
• Radiographic evidence of pneumoperitoneum, intra­
peritoneal bladder rupture, grade V renovascular injury.
• Peritonitis or the development to peritoneal signs
• Evisceration of intraperitoneal contents
• Evidence of fecal or bowel contamination on diagnostic
peritoneal lavage.
Nonoperative approach mandates pediatric intensive care
unit accessibility.

Clinical Pearls
• Cervical spine should be always taken care of in a child with
polytrauma
• Patients with persistent shock despite initial resuscitation
may have neurogenic shock, cardiac contusion, or cardiac
tamponade
• Multidisciplinary approach with one team leader.

Poisoning in Children
Pradeep K Sharma, Praveen Khilnani

INTRODUCTION
Various Indian studies report kerosene (30–50%), drugs
(11%), pesticides (11%), snakebites (10–20%), corrosives,
and household cleaning products as the common substance
causing poisonings. Certain household items often ingested
by children are proven to be nontoxic and harmless (Box 1).
However, ingestion of excessive amount of these substances
may lead to toxicity.

EVALUATION OF CHILDREN
WITH SUSPECTED TOXIN INGESTION
The acute management generally begins in the emergency
department with triage and the determination of appropriate
decontamination and treatment regimens. Immediate
attention to the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation
(ABC) should be done and following the establishment
of lifesaving supportive care, a detailed evaluation can be
performed (Algorhithm 1).

HISTORY
A comprehensive history may be obtained from witnesses,
family members, and friends. Nature of substance ingested,

its amount, time of ingestion, circumstances preceding,
smells or unusual items, occupation of those in home, and
queries regarding the presence of a suicide note is pivotal to
management. Obtaining an accurate history in adolescent
is especially challenging due to the potential use of multiple
substances, possible drug abuse, prolonged time between
ingestion and presentation, and attempts at concealing
information. Additional information includes the maximum
amount of toxin available and the minimum amount per
kilogram that produces symptoms. Quantity of liquid toxins
swallowed can be estimated as 5–10 mL in a young child and
10–15 mL in an adolescent. Product containers or medication
labels are helpful to identify specific toxic contents. A number
of medications have been determined to be potentially lethal
to a child who weighs 10 kg and ingests just one tablet, capsule,
or teaspoonful (Table 1).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
A comprehensive physical examination is crucial in
determining the involved agents and allows for specific
initial treatment. The signs and symptoms that suggest
specific classes of poisoning are generally grouped into
syndromes and referred to as toxidromes (Table 2). A vitals
recording also helps in determining the particular toxidrome
(Table 3).

SYSTEMIC EXAMINATION
Frequent neurologic examination is especially important,
as many toxins can depress the consciousness. Symmetrical
pupillary changes are typical of toxic exposures, with
asymmetry most commonly evidencing a structural or focal
neurologic abnormality. Detailed general physical and
systemic examinations help in pointing to a specific toxin as
shown in table 4.

LABORATORY EVALUATION
The laboratory generally confirms a diagnosis and also based
upon quantitative drug or toxin levels helps in deciding about
therapy. The drug or toxin levels are available for acetaminophen,
ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, lithium, salicylates, iron,
lead, mercury, arsenic, phenobarbital, carbon monoxide,
methemoglobin, and theophylline. A negative toxicology screen
by no means excludes the possibility of toxic exposure.
Arterial blood gas analysis evaluates acid-base status and
anion gap metabolic acidosis. Agents with elevated anion gap
can be summarized by the mnemonic MUDPILES as given
below.

Ch-46.indd 219

MUDPILES: methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, para­
ldehyde and phenformin, isoniazid and iron, lactic acidosis,
ethanol and ethylene glycol, salicylates.
Electrocardiogram is invaluable in detecting dysrhy­
thmias and conduction abnormalities. Increased serum
osmolality is seen with methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol,
acetone, and isopropanol. Complete blood cell count
with platelets and leukocyte differential, prothrombin
time, partial thromboplastin time, liver function tests, and
electroencephalogram may prove useful. Urine color may
be helpful in the identification of a number of toxins. It is
important to obtain urine pregnancy tests on patient of
childbearing age.

RADIOLOGIC IMAGING
Radiographic evaluation is useful for certain foreign bodies,
radiopaque drugs, metals, and chemicals. Serial chest/
abdominal X-rays identify the movement of the disc batteries
through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Radiopaque compounds
may be grouped by the mnemonic “COINS”: chloral hydrate
and cocaine packets, opiate packets, iron and heavy metals
(lead, arsenic and mercury), neuroleptics, and sustainedrelease or enteric coated tablets.

MANAGEMENT
The approach includes:
• Emergency stabilization
• Decontamination
• Enhanced elimination
• Antidote and poison specific therapy.

Emergency Stabilization
This begins with checking the ABC and stabilization. Because
the patient’s status can change rapidly, it is essential to

11/19/2016 3:06:32 PM

Chapter 46: Poisoning in Children
reassess the patient often and monitor the need for ventilator
support. Blood glucose should be obtained from patient
with ingestion of oral hypoglycemic agents, alcohol, and
with altered sensorium. Symptoms of hypoglycemia may
be rapidly reversed with intravenous dextrose. Intravenous
thiamine (10 mg for infants, 10–25 mg for children) should
be given before dextrose administration to prevent Wernicke
encephalopathy. Although altered mental status in a child
may be presumed to be from poisoning, traumatic head injury
should also be considered. Any child with coma, altered
sensorium, seizures, agitation, impaired vital parameter—
tachycardia/bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension/hyper­
tension, respiratory distress or depression, and organ failure
should be managed in pediatric intensive care unit.

the intestinal tract. Multiple doses should not include sorbitol
because of possible electrolyte and fluid abnormalities.

Decontamination

Surgical Decontamination

Decontamination may be individualized, depending upon
the type and amount of substance ingested, potential toxicity,
time elapsed since ingestion, and the symptoms exhibited.

Surgical intervention is usually indicated for mechanical bowel
obstruction or bowel ischemia due to heroin or cocaine drug
packets and also for massive iron ingestion with failure to
evacuate the GI tract.

Gastric Lavage
A mainstay of gastric decontamination, involves insertion
of a large-bore orogastric tube into the stomach, followed by
repeated administration and aspiration of 10–15 mL/kg saline
until aspirates is clear. This can be particularly traumatizing
to a young child. Contraindications include compromised
upper airway protection, ingestion of corrosive substances
or hydrocarbons, and patients at risk for GI perforation or
hemorrhage. Possible complications are aspiration, respiratory
compromise, mechanical injury/perforation, and electrolyte
imbalances. The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology
(AACT) and European Association of Poison Centers and
Clinical Toxicologists discourage its routine use unless
performed within 1 hour of the ingestion.

Syrup of Ipecac
In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy
statement advising that syrup of ipecac should no longer
be used.

Activated Charcoal
It works by adsorbing the toxin and preventing enterohepatic
and enteroenteric recirculation. A charcoal/drug ratio of
10:1 is recommended (1–2 g/kg). Activated charcoal (AC) is
helpful in carbamazepine, dapsone, phenobarbital, quinine,
theophylline, salicylates, phenytoin, or valproic acid ingestion.
AC is unpalatable, messy, and poorly accepted by young
children often causing vomiting. AC does not bind well with
xenobiotics that are highly ionized (e.g., metals, electrolytes,
acids, and alkali). In addition, AC is contraindicated in patients
who have ingested corrosives or hydrocarbons, in those with
bowel obstruction or perforation, and in patients with a
depressed level of consciousness.
The AACT discourages the routine use except within 1
hour of ingestion. The first dose is often given with a cathartic
agent, such as sorbitol, to improve taste and transit through

Ch-46.indd 221

Whole-bowel Irrigation
Whole-bowel irrigation (WBI) involves administration
of large volumes of polyethylene glycol solution orally to
decontaminate the GI tract. The pediatric dose is 25 mL/
kg/h, up to 500 mL/h in young children and up to 1 L/h in
adolescents. It may be useful when a drug or toxicant does not
have an antidote or treatment and the substance ingested is
an enteric pill, sustained release preparation, or agents poorly
adsorbed by AC. Examples are lithium, iron, and lead. Adverse
effects of WBI include vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating,
and rarely, aspiration pneumonitis.

Enhanced Elimination
Active elimination techniques should be considered only
in ingestion of a potentially lethal dose of toxin, progressive
clinical deterioration refractory to aggressive supportive care,
and blood concentrations that indicate serious intoxication
and impaired organ function. Hemodialysis (HD) is useful for
drugs with small volume of distribution, poor plasma protein
binding, low molecular weight, and weak lipid solubility,
e.g., atenolol, ethylene glycol, methanol, and salicylates.
Hemoperfusion, using a charcoal filter in a HD machine, can
remove toxins with high molecular weight, e.g., barbiturates,
carbamazepine, chloral hydrate, dapsone, isoniazid, pro­
cainamide, organophosphates, and diphenhydramine.
Exchange transfusion is an alternative procedure for a
small group of children who are not eligible for HD. Beneficial
effects are seen with salicylate, theophylline, phenobarbital,
chloramphenicol, lithium, aniline, chloral hydrate, salicylate,
quinine, and methemoglobinemia. Extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation has been used for hydrocarbon-induced lung
injury, bupropion, amiodarone, calcium channel blocker
overdose, and a severe ibuprofen poisoning.

Diuresis
Drug elimination may be facilitated by ensuring adequate
renal flow 2–5 mL/kg/h. Elimination of drugs with pKa
values of 3.0–7.2 may be enhanced by alkalinizing the urine,
e.g., salicylate, phenobarbital, chlorpropamide, and the
chlorophenoxy herbicides. Complications are fluid overload,
with cerebral edema, pulmonary edema, and hyponatremia.

Toxin-specific Treatments
If physical examination or laboratory findings suggest a specific
toxidrome, then consider toxin specific treatments, such as an
antidote (Table 5). Antidotes are usually given after the patient

CONCLUSION
Poison prevention remains a challenge and a necessity to
prevent the most vulnerable population from becoming

exposed to potentially lethal drugs and toxins. The evaluation
of a child presumed to have been exposed to a toxic
substance should include a precise history of the exposure, a
physical examination, and knowledge of current ingestions
and recreational practices. Poison centers and medical
toxicologists should be consulted to assist with the diagnosis
and management of medicinal/drug overdoses.

Clinical Pearls
• Common toxidromes can identify many poisonous substances
(Tables 2 and 3)
• Causes of high anion gap—MUDPILES: methanol, uremia,
diabetic ketoacidosis, paraldehyde and phenformin, isoniazid
and iron, lactic acidosis, ethanol and ethylene glycol, salicylates.

Key points

Snakebite Envenomation
Soonu Udani, Narendra Rathi

INTRODUCTION
A victim of a snakebite needs to be treated appropriately
and rapidly. The outcome can be excellent if a protocolized
approach is used.
First aid: many old practices are known to do more harm
than good.
• No—incision, suction, ice packs, washing wound, tourniquet
• Reassurance important though neglected step. The
sympathetic storm caused by fear and anxiety with pain, is
deleterious to the hemodynamics of the patient
• Immobilize bitten part/victim by a splint. Bandage the part
by starting distal to the bite and going above the joint
• Carry the child
• Lateral decubitus to prevent aspiration, if weakness should
set in and compromise the airway.

TYPE AND SEVERITY OF THE BITE
•
•
•
•

Identifying species is not vital as the venom available is
trivalent for krait, viper, and cobra
Take it seriously! Small snake, second bite, severed head
are all equally dangerous
Number of bites. The more the bites, the more the enveno­
mation
Amount of venom injected for size of patient. The snake
injects the same amount of venom and the smaller the size
of the patient, the higher the dose
Box 1: Identifying species clinically if possible
• Cobra: local signs + neurotoxic
• Krait: no local signs + neurotoxic
• Viper: local signs + coagulopathy
• Sea snake: no local signs + myotoxic
• “Every snakebite does not need anti-snake venom”
• “Every poisonous snakebite does not need anti-snake venom”

Ch-47.indd 223

•

Neurotoxic and hemorrhage effects. Timing of onset can be
variable.
Local signs: Viper versus cobra
• Pain, wheal, swelling, bullae. Regional lymphadenopathy
develops rather rapidly
• Blood filled bullae—viper
• Necrosis, gangrene, and anaerobic infections are common.

Neurotoxic Effects
•
•

Neuromuscular blockade: flaccid paralysis
Ptosis (earliest): inability to look up, external ophthalmo­
plegia
• Palate, jaw, tongue, larynx, neck, deglutition: ask the child
to open mouth and protrude tongue
• Accumulation of secretions: bulbar palsy
• Flaccid quadriplegia.
It lasts 2–4 days and recover over next 2–5 days, but the
timings can be variable and effects may last for several days.
[anti-snake venom (ASV) will have no effect on already fixed
toxin].

Hemorrhagic Effects
•
•
•
•
•
•

Bleeding from fang marks and injection sites.
Blood filled bullae locally
Bleeding gums
Epistaxis
Gastrointestinal tract bleed
Intracranial hemorrhage.
The 20-minute whole blood clotting time (WBCT), a simple,
bedside, reliable method to diagnose hemorrhagic effects,
monitor ASV effectiveness, and control its adminis­
tration.
Also, helps hemorrhagic effects of venom from disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy from sepsis.
Put 2–5 mL blood into a dry, clean, new test tube, leave
undisturbed for 20 minutes and check for clotting by gentle
movement.
Test to be done on admission and 6 hourly.

Treatment

•

Supportive Therapy
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Rapid assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation
Open airway, oxygenate if needed
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if needed
Tetanus toxoid
Intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics with anaerobic coverage
Blood components readied
Mechanical ventilation.

Specific Therapy
It includes ASV and neostigmine.
Indications of ASV:
• Signs of local envenomation
{{ Swelling involving greater than ½ bitten limb
{{ Rapid extension of swelling beyond joint
{{ Regional lymphadenopathy
• In absence of tourniquet
• Signs of systemic envenomation
{{ Neurotoxic signs
{{ Hemorrhagic signs
{{ Cardiovascular: shock, arrhythmia, electrocardiogram
abnormalities
{{ Acute renal failure
{{ Hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria
{{ Polymorphonuclear leukocytosis.
Anti-snake venom dose: symptomatology is not useful for
dose. The same dose applies to adults and children as it is to
neutralize the poison and that quantity remains the same.
Table 1 shows the dose relationship and the rationale of using a
standard 8–10 + 5–10 vial dosage regimen.
Neurotoxic: if no response to first dose of ASV and neostigmine
in 2 hours, then second dose of ASV is to be used. If there is no
response to the second dose, then start/continue ventilation.
Neostigmine: it is useful for neuromuscular junction
blockade caused by neurotoxic snakebites. It is useful only
for postsynaptic type of blockade (occurring with cobra bites)
and not for presynaptic block (krait bites cause both pre- and
postsynaptic blockade).

Select the objective measure of impairment like single

maintained and establish the value
• Give intramuscular (IM) neostigmine 25–50 µg/kg with
0.05 mg/kg atropine IV every 10 minutes till the objective
measure is reassessed
• Improvement should become evident after 20 minutes.
Hemorrhagic: repeat 20-minute WBCT after 6 hours, if positive
give second dose of ASV.
Support with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets and
packed red blood cells as needed. Dialysis may be needed for
renal failure.
Anti-snake venom administration: Only IV, not IM/SC
• No sensitivity testing is advocated. As soon as possible,, if
signs of envenomation
• Not useful to prevent local tissue necrosis, so there should
be no local infiltration
• 8–10 vials dissolved in 200 mL normal saline over 1 hour.
Repeat in 2–6 hours. (hematotoxin requires more dosing
than neurotoxin as it is in the circulation and can be
neutralized).
If anaphylaxis occurs:
• Stop immediately if pruritus, urticaria, fever, vomiting,
diarrhea, hypotension, bronchospasm
• Intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine) (0.01 mg/kg)
• Intravenous hydrocortisone (2 mg/kg)
• Intravenous antihistamine (avil 0.2 mg/kg)
• Second dose of epinephrine if no improvement/
deterioration in 15 minutes → starts an infusion
• Restart ASV: after complete recovery, slow infusion for
15 minutes, close supervision, after 15 minutes, resume
normal drip rate.
Mechanical ventilation: even when ASV not available,
mechanical ventilation is life saving.
Indication: respiratory paralysis, inability to handle secretions.
Local therapy, like debridement and incision drainage,
should be done only after
• ASV is given
• Do not underestimate the necrosis that can occur—the
need for amputation is not uncommon
• Elevation of bitten part
• Aspiration of bullae, only if tense.
Debridement, dressing, grafting: avoid fasciotomy as it may
spread the venom again.

Clinical Pearls
•
•
•
•

Snakebite is like poisoning
Call up an expert or check the books for details
Do not transport unstable patients
Supportive management can save a life even without antisnake venom, especially in neurotoxic bites.

))
Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are of
utmost important in saving a child with neurotoxic respiratory
paralysis in isolation and in combination with ASV
))
Do not ignore bite by small snakes, bite after eating prey, or
bite after several strikes—all such bites are capable of severe
envenomation.

Initial Approach to
a Comatose Child
Soonu Udani

INTRODUCTION
Whatever the initiating event that results in altered sensorium,
it is the “secondary injury” (which results from hypoxia and
hypoperfusion), that has huge impact on the eventual outcome.
The approach to a child with altered sensorium, therefore,
focuses on the efforts to prevent or limit this secondary injury,
while trying to offer specific treatment.
Rapidly evaluate the appearance, breathing, and
circulation. Confirm the altered sensorium and proceed with
further assessment only if the child is stable. If the child is
unstable, “the initial management priorities are to stabilize and
support the airway, breathing, and circulation, irrespective of
the etiology”.
Every patient of altered sensorium/coma should be
treated as having increased intracranial pressure (ICP) until
proved otherwise: an unstable airway leads to hypoxia →
cerebral vaso­dilation → increase in cerebral blood flow →
increase in ICP.
Open with “jawthrust” or “chin lift” method if the spine is
deemed unaffected.
Indications for intubation with full and proper sedation
and muscle relaxant with premedication with lidocaine is
illustrated in Box 1.
Focus on
• Oxygenation: partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) less than 60
mmHg (> 95% SpO2)
• Ventilation: partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) →
mid-30s
Box 1: Indications for intubation
• Glasgow Coma Scale ≤12 or AVPU [A (alert) V (responds to voice)
P (responds to pain) U (unresponsive)]
• Features of herniation
• Abnormal respiration
• Asymmetric or dilated pupils
• Inability to handle secretions (absent gag, gurgling sounds)

Overzealous hyperventilation → CO2 too low → danger
of hypoperfusion and drop in cerebral perfusion.
Cerebral perfusion pressure = Mean arterial pressure
– Intracranial pressure
Target mean arterial pressures (MAP) to 70 mmHg
minimum considering a target CPP of 50 mmHg
Isotonic fluids, inotropes [maintain blood pressure (BP) =
95th centile
When monitoring of ICP/MAP unavailable, avoid hypo­
osmolar/hyperosmolar fluids—no role of fluid restriction
High BP at presentation → effect/cause—reduce slowly
after ICP ruled out
Glycemic control less than 180 mg/dL.

BEWARE HYPOGLYCEMIA
Worsening Glasgow Coma Scale despite
correction of Airway, Breathing,
and Circulation (Box 2)

• Abnormal breathing pattern
• Abnormal oculocephalic (doll’s eye) or oculovestibular reflex
• Abnormal pupillary response

Imaging: if signs of raised ICP, no lumbar puncture—
magnetic resonance imaging preferable. If not, computed
tomography to check edema and impending herniation.

Immediate Treatment
•
•
•

Treatment for raised ICP: mannitol 1.25–2 mL/kg. Hypertonic
saline to osmolarity of 310–360 mmol/L. Controlled
ventilation and supportive nursing management.

More broad based treatment covering meningitis, herpes,
malaria, and other treatable infections, if cause is not

Fever without Focus in Infants
Less than 3 Months of Age
Balasubramanian Sundaram

INTRODUCTION
The differential diagnosis involving fever in neonates and
young infants 29–60 days of age includes both infectious and
non-infectious causes. Although self-limited viral infections
are the most common cause of fever, the incidence of serious
bacterial infections (SBIs) may be higher in this population
compared to older children; neonates have been shown to
be at particularly high risk. SBIs include bacteremia (e.g.,
sepsis), cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis,
pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI).
Among these, UTI is the most common type of SBI. Among
bacterial pathogens causing SBI in infants less than 90 days
of age, Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and Klebsiella
are most frequently identified. Other common pathogens
are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
Neisseria meningitidis, S. aureus and less commonly Group B
streptococcus and Listeria monocytogenes. Neonatal herpes
simplex virus (HSV) is an important consideration in infants
0–28 days of age. Neonates with cutaneous vesicles, seizures,
and/or elevated transaminases present a high index of
suspicion for HSV infection; however, it is rare for a neonate
with HSV to present with fever of uncertain source (FUS).
Because the clinical examination alone is unable to
reliably predict serious illness in infants less than 60 days of
age with FUS and culture results are not immediately available,
clinicians must often approach management of patients
with fever by relying on a combination of history, physical
examination findings, and diagnostic screening tests.

DEFINITION
The term fever without focus or fever without localizing Signs
or FUS is defined as an acute febrile illness in which the
etiology of the fever is not apparent after a thorough history
and physical examination. A rectal temperature higher than
38ºC (100.4ºF) has been defined as fever in literature.

Ch-49.indd 228

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Risk of SBI varies with age. Risk is greatest during the immediate
neonatal period and through the first month (and is heightened
in the infant born prematurely). Even among neonates, only
7% of those who have fever without focus have an SBI.

LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS
Various diagnostic tests to quantify the risk of bacteremia
and its complications have been assessed including the white
blood cells count and differential, microscopic examination of
buffy coat of blood, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive
protein, procalcitonin serum levels, morphologic changes
in peripheral blood neutrophils, and quantitative cultures of
blood. In addition, clinical scales have been developed to help
identify the febrile child with a serious illness.
The outcome of primary concern is not occult bacteremia
but meningitis. An ideal diagnostic test would specifically
identify febrile children at risk of a serious complication,
because many focal infections after bacteremia (e.g., most
cases of either pneumonia or cellulitis) can be treated when
they become apparent and are not usually associated with
serious sequelae. Unfortunately, there is no such test. Lowering
the risk of serious complications by preventing infections
through use of conjugate vaccines has proven to be the most
effective strategy.

MANAGEMENT
There is general agreement that febrile children who are
“very young” (variably considered to be younger than 3, 2, or
1 month of age) should be managed differently from the way
in which older children are managed (Algorithm 1). Some
clinicians adhere to a protocol of treating all young infants
with fever and no apparent focus of infection with broadspectrum antimicrobial agents administered intravenously

11/24/2016 12:46:59 PM

Chapter 49: Fever without Focus in Infants Less than 3 Months of Age
in the hospital until the results of cultures of the blood, urine
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are known. Although sometimes
perceived as the “safe” approach, such management
incurs considerable financial cost and risk of iatrogenic
complications and of diagnostic misadventures associated
with hospitalization.
These risks include errors in the type and dosage of drugs,
complications of venous cannulation (such as phlebitis and
sloughing of the skin), and nosocomial infections. many experts
believe that febrile infants from 2 to 3 months of age with no
apparent focus of infection who appear well and/or who have
a laboratory-documented viral infection can be managed
without either additional laboratory tests or hospitalization,
provided that careful follow-up is ensured.
If an antimicrobial agent is to be administered, cultures of
the blood, urine and CSF should be obtained first. Rapid tests
for specific viral pathogens, which now are widely available,
may aid decisions about managing patients and may reduce
the need for and/or the duration of hospitalization.
Febrile infants at low risk of SBI for whom adequate
home observation and follow-up cannot be ensured should
be hospitalized and can be observed without antimicrobial
treatment. Doing so (if the child appears well) is reasonable
and avoids the adverse side effects of antimicrobial agents
and intravenous cannulation, shortens the duration of
hospitalization, and saves money without placing the child at
significant risk of complications.
Most febrile infants with no apparent focus of infection
who are younger than 1 month should be hospitalized and
treated with antimicrobial therapy. The choice of antibiotic
would depend on local epidemiological data and antibiotic
susceptibility patterns in the area of practice. A third
generation cephalosporin with an aminoglycoside would be

protein; IV, intravenous; LP, lumbar puncture; WBC, white blood cell.

generally sufficient for initial empiric therapy in most infants
with community acquired infection.

PITFALLS AND PEARLS IN
ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS
1. Parental report of fever via palpation is unreliable as a sole
method of determining fever.
2. Practice guidelines recommend that if a neonate has had
a fever recorded at home by a reliable parent, the patient
should be treated as a febrile neonate.
3. If excessive clothing and blankets encasing the infant
are suspected of falsely elevating the body temperature,
then the excessive coverings should be removed and the
temperature retaken in 15–30 minutes. If body temperature
is normal after the covers are removed, then the infant is
considered afebrile.
4. A response to antipyretic medication does not change the
likelihood of an infant having an SBI.
5. Clinical assessment include a thorough history and
physical examination (include questions about recent
symptoms, vaccinations, exposure to sick contacts, and the
child’s birth history in the patient history).
6. The large majority of children with fever without localizing
signs in the 1–3 months age group likely have a viral
syndrome.
7. Ill-appearing (toxic) febrile infants less than or equal
to 3 months of age require prompt hospitalization and
immediate parenteral antimicrobial therapy after cultures
of blood, urine, and CSF are obtained. It is recommended
that the following laboratory studies be performed in
neonates with FUS, complete blood count, differential,
blood culture urinalysis and urine culture. cerebrospinal
fluid studies:
i. Tube 1: protein and glucose
ii. Tube 2: culture, sensitivity, Gram stain
iii. Tube 3: cell count and differential
iv. Tube 4: hold for additional studies. Stool culture if
diarrhea is present.
8. Well-appearing infants 1–3 months of age can be managed
safely using low-risk laboratory and clinical criteria if
reliable parents are involved and close follow-up is assured
(Table 1).
9. Among SBIs, pyelonephritis is the most common and
may be seen in well-appearing infants who have fever
without a focus or in those who appear ill. Urinalysis
may be negative in infants less than 2 months of age with
pyelonephritis.
10. Analysis of CSF for HSV using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) may be considered in neonates with CSF pleocytosis
and a negative Gram stain.
11. Delaying or omitting a lumbar puncture for CSF analyses
may be considered in young infants 29–60 days of age
with FUS who meet all applicable low-risk clinical and
laboratory criteria (Box 1).

13. A chest X-ray may be performed in neonates and young
infants 29–60 days of age who manifest one or more of
the following clinical findings: tachypnea more than
60 breaths/min, crackles in the chest, retractions, nasal
flaring, cyanosis or oxygen saturation less than 95%.
14. In patients who are not responding to antimicrobial therapy,
the clinician should consider additional evaluation and
treatment options, including: alternative antimicrobial
therapy for resistant organisms (in neonates only) CSF HSV
PCR (if not completed previously) and empiric treatment
with acyclovir.

Key points

))
Although controversy remains as how to best manage
acutely febrile infants and children, there are several areas of
near consensus
))
Infants aged less than or equal to 60 days continue to have
the highest rates of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) and
pose a challenge to practitioners attempting to determine
how extensive an evaluation to perform in a non-toxic
appearing child
))
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common SBIs in
all age groups
))
Assessment for UTI should be part of any evaluation for all but
the lowest-risk patients (i.e., circumcised boys)
))
New technologies can more rapidly diagnose common viral
and bacterial infections and recommendations to simplify the
management of these febrile infants and children are needed.

Acute Viral Encephalitis
Jaydeep Choudhury

Introduction
Acute viral encephalitis is an important cause of mortality and
morbidity in children. Most of the times acute viral encephalitis
is a clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation is not
possible due to lack of availability of diagnostic testing for most
of the agents. A period of up to 14 days is considered to define
“acute”. Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) including Japanese
B encephalitis (JE) is a group of clinically similar neurologic
manifestation caused by several different viruses, bacteria,
fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemical/toxins, etc. There is
seasonal and geographical variation in the causative organism.
It may be sporadic like herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) or
epidemic such as JE. The outbreak of JE usually coincides with
the monsoon and post-monsoon period when the density of
mosquitoes increases while encephalitis due to other viruses
especially enteroviruses occurs throughout the year as it is
water borne disease. For surveillance purposes, all the acute
encephalitis cases to be reported under the heading of acute
encephalitis.
The case fatality rate of AES is very high and those who
survive may suffer with various neurological sequelae.
Children are at risk of highest attack rates because of lack of
cumulative immunity due to natural infection. Encephalitis,
usually caused by a virus, cannot be treated with antibiotics.
A good clinical management is important to reduce the risk of
disability or death from the disease.
Clinically, a case of AES is defined as a person of any age,
at any time of year with the acute onset of fever and a change
in mental status (including symptoms such as confusion,
disorientation, come, or inability to talk) and/or new onset
of seizures (excluding simple febrile seizures). Other early
clinical findings may include an increase in irritability,
somnolence or abnormal behavior greater than that seen
with usual febrile illness.
It is important to note that in an epidemic situation fever
with altered sensorium persisting for more than 2 hours with

Ch-50.indd 231

a focal seizure or paralysis of any part of body is encephalitis.
Presence of rash on body excludes Japanese encephalitis.
AES with symmetrical signs and fever is likely to be cerebral
malaria.
A suspected case that meets the clinical case definition
for AES may be classified in one of the following four ways as
shown in algorithm 1.
• Laboratory-confirmed JE: a suspected case that has been
laboratory-confirmed as JE
• Probable JE: a suspected case that occurs in close
geographic and temporal relationship to laboratoryconfirmed case of JE, in the context of an outbreak
• Acute encephalitis syndrome (due to agent other than JE):
a suspected case in which diagnostic testing is performed
and an etiological agent other than JE virus is identified
• Acute encephalitis syndrome (due to unknown agent): a
suspected case in which no diagnostic testing is performed
or in which testing was performed but no etiological
agent was identified or in which the test results were
indeterminate.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
A case of viral encephalitis including JE presents with a
prodrome of fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting,
and myalgia lasting for 1–5 days. It is followed by irritability,
altered behavior, convulsions, and coma. The progression of
disease is rapid. Features of raised intracranial tension are
commonly present in acute stage of illness. The patient may
develop difficulty of speech and other neurological deficits
like ocular palsies, hemiplegia, quadriplegia and may have
extrapyramidal signs in the form of dystonia, choreoathetosis,
and coarse tremors.
All the cases of AES should be reported as they have
similar clinical manifestations. Their case management
usually follows a common protocol along with situation
specific treatment.

MANAGEMENT
Acute encephalitis syndrome is a medical emergency and it
requires immediate consideration of vital functions including
life support, identification of cause and institution of specific
therapy if available. Management of AES including Japanese
encephalitis is essentially symptomatic. To reduce severe
morbidity and mortality, it is important to identify early
warning signs and refer patients to health facility.
The step-wise management of AES is as follows.

Step I: Rapid Assessment and Stabilization
•

•
•

232

•

Ch-50.indd 232

Establish and maintain airway: The child has to be intubated
if glasgow coma scale (GCS) less than 8, there is impaired
airway reflexes, abnormal respiratory pattern, signs of
raised intracranial pressure (ICP), oxygen saturation less
than 92% despite high flow oxygen and fluid refractory
shock
Ventilation, adequate oxygenation
Circulation: intravenous (IV) access has to be established,
samples to be collected for investigation (complete blood
count, blood sugar, liver function test, renal function test,
electrolytes, blood gas, lactate, peripheral smear and rapid
diagnostic test for malarial parasite, serology for viruses).
Fluid bolus to be given if in circulatory failure (20 mL/kg
0.9% NaCl), inotropes if required
Signs of cerebral herniation or raised ICP should be
identified

•
•

Temperature: fever and hypothermia should be treated
Ongoing seizures: benzodiazepine, followed by phenytoin
loading if required.

Step II: Clinical Evaluation:
History and Examination
The following are the important aspects in history and
examination. The approach to a suspected case of AES is
shown in algorithm 2.
• Fever, headache, vomiting, seizures, abnormal posturing
• Altered behavior, cognition, personality changes, altered
consciousness
• Prodromal symptoms, flu-like illness, diarrhea
• Rash, vesicles, past history of chicken pox
• Residence: rural/urban, endemic for cerebral malaria, any
epidemic of AES in neighborhood
• History of animal contact, insect bite, dog bite
• Drug or toxin exposure
• Recent history of travel
• History of trauma
• Personal or family history of seizure disorder
• Recent immunizations
• History of recurrent episodes of encephalopathy: These are
characteristic of some inborn errors of metabolism (urea
cycle defects, organic acidemias, and fatty acid oxidation
defects). It may also be present in migraine, epilepsy and
substance abuse

Past medical illness: diabetes, congenital heart disease,
chronic kidney or liver disease
Family history of previous infant/child deaths
Pre-morbid developmental/neurological status of the child
Risk factors for immunodeficiency: HIV risk factors, cancer
treatment and steroid/immunosuppressant treatment.

Step III: Investigation/
Samples to Be Collected
•

•

•

Ch-50.indd 233

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): in hemodynamically stable
patients without any features of raised intracranial pressure,
lumbar puncture should be performed. Cerebrospinal
fluid should be examined for cytology, biochemistry, Gram
stain, Ziehl–Neelsen stain for acid fast bacilli, bacterial
culture, latex agglutination, polymerase chain reaction
for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and immunoglobulin
M antibodies for JE and for dengue virus depending on
clinical suspicion. Usual CSF findings in viral encephalitis
include lymphocytic pleocytosis, mild to moderately
elevated protein, and normal CSF sugar. Similar findings
may occur in tubercular meningitis and partially treated
pyogenic meningitis; however, the CSF sugar is likely to be
low in these situations
Blood/serum, urine: complete blood count including
platelet count, blood glucose, serum electrolytes, liver and
kidney function tests, blood culture, arterial blood gas and
lactate. Peripheral smear for malarial parasite and rapid
diagnostic test for malaria should be obtained. Chest X-ray
should also be obtained
Neuroimaging: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
computed tomography scan may give valuable information
such as presence of bleed, cerebral edema, temporal
lobe hypodensities in HSE, thalamic abnormalities in
JE, and basal exudates and hydrocephalus in tubercular
meningitis. Computed tomography may also show brain
herniation, effacement of cisterns, infective collections
such as brain abscesses and subdural empyema.

•

Neuroimaging is not needed if the etiology is clear by
other investigations, e.g., cerebral malaria, pyogenic
meningitis. Suggestive MRI findings are present in some
conditions of viral encephalitis such as HSE, JE, and
enterovirus encephalitis
Throat swab, nasopharyngeal swab.

Step IV: Empirical Treatment
Empirical treatment must be started, pending the results of
investigations.
• Ceftriaxone: a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as
ceftriaxone must be given, which can be stopped if there is
no evidence of bacterial meningitis
• Acyclovir (should be started in all suspected sporadic
viral encephalitis). Dose of acyclovir 3 months to 12 years
is 500 mg/m2 8 hourly. In children above 12 years
10 mg/kg 8 hourly. Duration of treatment in confirmed
cases should be 14–21 days intravenous treatment and
minimum 21 days for those aged 3 months to 12 years
• Artemether combination therapy: in cerebral malaria.

Step V: Supportive Care and Treatment
•
•

•
•

Euglycemia should be maintained, fever should be
controlled and hydration maintained
Raised ICP to be treated with mild head-end elevation
by 15–30°. Mannitol 20% IV 5 mL/kg over 30 min as first
dose then 2.5 mL/kg at 6 hourly intervals up to 48 hours.
Injection furosemide IV 1 mg/kg up to 40 mg can be given
Seizures: anticonvulsant to be given if history of seizures or
if GCS less than 8, or child has features of raised ICP
Steroids: pulse steroids (methylprednisolone or dexa­
methasone) to be given in children with suspected acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis.

Step VI: Prevention/Treatment of Complications
and Rehabilitation
•
•

Physiotherapy, posture change, prevention of bed sores,
and exposure keratitis
Complications like aspiration pneumonia, nosocomial
infections, and coagulation defects to be treated accordingly

Acute Osteomyelitis
Baldev S Prajapati, Rajal B Prajapati

INTRODUCTION
Acute osteomyelitis in children is an important condition
because of its potential to cause permanent disability. It
is common in infants and toddlers than in older children.
Early recognition of acute osteomyelitis in young patients
before extensive infection develops and prompt institution of
appropriate medical and surgical therapy minimize permanent
damage. Acute osteomyelitis in neonates and infants is
commonly associated with septic arthritis due to peculiar
vascularity of the physis and epiphysis. The risk is greatest if the
physis (the growth plate of bone) is damaged. Once the growth
plate forms, it acts as a barrier and in toddlers and children the
infection is usually confined to the metaphysis.

PATHOGENESIS
The unique anatomy and circulation of the ends of long bones
result in the predilection for localization of blood borne
bacteria. In the metaphysis, nutrient arteries branch into
non-anastomosing capillaries under the physis, which make
a sharp loop before entering venous sinusoids draining into
the marrow (Fig. 1). Blood flow in this area is sluggish and
provides an ideal environment for bacteria seeding. Once a
bacterial focus is established, phagocytes migrate to the site
and produce inflammatory exudates (metaphyseal abscess).
The generation of proteolytic enzymes, toxic oxygen radicals,
and cytokines result in decreased oxygen tension, decreased
pH, osteolysis, and tissue destruction. As the inflammatory
exudate progresses, pressure increases spread through the
porous metaphyseal space via the Haversian system and
Volkmann canals into the subperiosteal space. Purulence
beneath the periosteum may lift the periosteal membrane of
the bony surface, further impairing blood supply to the cortex
and metaphysis.
In the newborns and young infants, transphyseal blood
vessels connect the metaphysis and epiphysis (Fig. 2). So it
is common for pus from the metaphysis to enter the joint

space. This extension through the physis (growth plate) has
the potential to result in abnormal growth and bone or joint

deformity. During the later part of infancy, the physis forms,
obliterating the transphyseal blood vessels. Joint involvement
once the physis forms may occur in joint where the metaphysis
is intraarticular (hip, ankle, shoulder, and elbow) and
subperiosteal pus ruptures into the joint space.
In the later childhood, the periosteum becomes more
adherent, favoring pus to decompress through the periosteum.
Once the growth plate closes in the late adolescence,
hematogenous osteomyelitis more often begins in diaphysis
and can spread to the entire intramedullary canal. With trivial
trauma, the hematoma which forms in the metaphysis acts as a
perfect soil for bacteria to seed.

their association with different conditions
Common clinical association Microorganism

ETIOLOGY
Bacteria are the most common pathogens in acute osteo­
myelitis. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infecting
organism in all age groups, including new borns. Escherichia
coli, Klebsiella, and Group B streptococci are also prominent
pathogens in neonates. Group A streptococci constitutes less
than 10% of all cases. After the age of 6 years, most cases of
acute osteomyelitis are caused by S. aureus, streptococcus or
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Salmonella species and S. aureus are
the two most common causes of osteomyelitis in children with
sickle cell anemia. Pneumococcus may also cause osteomyelitis
in children with sickle cell anemia.
Infection with atypical mycobacteria, S. aureus or
Pseudomonas can occur after penetrating injuries. Fungal
infection usually occurs as part of multisystem disseminated
disease. Candida osteomyelitis sometimes complicates
fungemia in neonates with indwelling vascular catheters.
Overcrowded neonatal nursery, poor aseptic precautions
while insertion of indwelling catheters and other procedures
and their poor maintenance are common factors responsible
for hematogenous spread acute osteomyelitis in neonates and
young infants. It is very common scenario at our set up that
a neonate presents with acute osteomyelitis after few days of
discharge from nursery. Nosocomial infections are also very
common in this group.
Community acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylo­
coccus aureus (MRSA) is also emerging as a potent cause of
acute osteomyelitis in children in many parts of the world,
including India.
Acute osteomyelitis following skin infection like pyoderma
or pneumonia is also known in our patients (Table 1).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

236

The signs and symptoms of acute osteomyelitis are highly
dependent on the age of the patient (Box 1).
• Abrupt onset of high grade fever. Fever is present in only
50% of neonates
• Signs of toxemia and irritability, like generalized
manifestations, are more common in neonates
• Pain with movement of the affected extremity. Pseudo­
paralysis (restriction of movement) is very common in
neonates and young infants due to pain

Box 1: Common clinical manifestations
• Abrupt onset of high grade fever. Fever only in 50% of neonates
• Signs of toxemia, irritability more common in neonates
• Pain with movement of affected extremity
• Restriction of movement—pseudoparalysis
• Limp or refusal to walk
• Limb held in flexion of adjacent joints
• Local edema, erythema, tenderness, cellulitis

•

Limp or refusal to walk in older children with involvement
of lower extremities
Affected limb held in position of flexion of adjacent joints
Local edema, erythema and tenderness
Focal tenderness over a long bone
Local swelling and redness indicate infection has spread
out of the metaphysis into the subperiosteal space. It
represents secondary soft tissue inflammatory response
(cellulitis)
Long bones are commonly involved in acute osteomyelitis.
Femur (27%), tibia (22%), and humerus (12%) are common
bones involved in osteomyelitis. The femur and tibia
together constitute almost half of the cases. Flat bones are
less commonly affected
Single site of bone or joint involvement is common. The
exception is osteomyelitis in neonates, in whom two or
more bones are affected in almost half of the cases
Subacute symptoms and focal findings in metaphyseal
area over tibia may be due to a Brodie abscess.

LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS (box 2)
•
•

No specific laboratory tests for osteomyelitis
Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are sensitive for
bone infections but are non-specific and cannot distinguish
between skeletal infections and other inflammatory
conditions. Leukocytosis with increased polymorphs is

11/19/2016 3:43:40 PM

Chapter 51: Acute Osteomyelitis
Box 2: Laboratory investigations
• No specific laboratory tests
• Leukocytosis with raised polymorphs
• Significantly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
C-reactive protein
• Blood culture
• Aspiration for Gram stain and culture

•
•

very common. Acute phase reactants, like ESR, and CRP
are significantly raised
Blood culture should be routine in all cases of suspected
osteomyelitis. It may be positive in 50% of cases with
hemaotgenous osteomyelitis
Aspiration for Gram stain and culture is the definitive
diagnostic technique.

RADIO IMAGING STUDIES (box 3)
Radio imaging studies play a crucial role in evaluation of
osteomyelitis. Conventional radiographs, ultrasonography,
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and
radionuclide studies may all contribute to establishing
the diagnosis. Plain radiographs are often used for initial
evaluation to exclude other causes such as trauma and foreign
bodies. Magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a very
sensitive and specific test and is widely used for diagnosis. The
sequence of radionuclide studies or MRI is often determined
by age, site and clinical presentation.

Computed Tomography Scan
•
•
•

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
•

•
•

•

Overlying soft tissue edema after 3–5 days infection may be
suggesting osteomyelitis
Lytic bone changes are evident on radiographs after 7–14
days of onset of infection in tubular long bones. Flat and
irregular bones can take longer time. Lytic bone changes
are not visible on radiographs until 30–50% of bony matrix
is destroyed.

Ultrasonography
•
•
•

Simple and inexpensive
Very sensitive, can diagnose subtle signs like sub­periosteal
edema soft tissue swelling within 2–3 days of infection
USG guided aspiration can be attempted to determine
presence of infection. Aspiration has found positive results
in 70–80% of cases.
Box 3: Radio imaging studies
• Plain radiograph shows lytic bone changes after 7–14 days of
onset of infection. It is very late. Do not wait for radiographical
changes for diagnosis
• Ultrasonography (USG)—simple and inexpensive. Very sensitive.
USG guided aspiration has found positive in 70–80% of cases
• Magnetic resonance imaging is best radiographic imaging,
effective in early detection and surgical localization, sensitivity
90–100%

Ch-51.indd 237

Best radiographic imaging technique for identification of
abscess and differentiation between bone and soft tissue
infection
Effective in early detection and surgical localization of
osteomyelitis
Sensitivity ranges from 90% to 100%.

Radionuclide Bone Scanning
•

Useful when osteomyelitis is suspected but difficult to
ascertain clinically
• Can detect osteomyelitis within 24–48 hours after onset of
symptoms
• Three phase imaging with 99 m Tc has 85–100% sensitivity
and 75–95% specificity in hematogenous osteomyelitis
• Sensitivity in neonates is much lower due to poor bone
mineralization.
Radio nuclide bone scanning is useful when osteomyelitis
is suspected but difficult to ascertain clinically, can detect in
24–48 hours, less sensitive in neonates.

Plain Radiographs
•

CT can demonstrate osseous and soft tissue abnor­malities
and is ideal for detecting gas in soft tissues
Can depict abnormal calcification, ossification and intracortical abnormalities
Most useful in the evaluation of spinal vertebral lesions,
pelvis, sternum, etc.

addition to good anti-staphylococcus activity, clindamycin
has broad activity against anaerobes and is useful for the
treatment of infection secondary to penetrating injuries or
compound fractures
Injection vancomycin and injection clindamycin are
alternatives for MRSA

Sequential antibiotics therapy:
Intravenous antibiotics duration varies from 10 days
to 3 weeks. Appropriate antibiotic respond includes
clinical and laboratory improvement. A decreasing
CRP and white blood cell count with absence of local
signs and symptoms should initiate to oral antibiotics.
Duration of antibiotic therapy:
{{ For S. aureus or Gram-negative bacillary infections, the
minimal duration of antibiotics is 28 days, but 6 weeks
therapy is desirable.
{{ For Group A streptococcus and S. pneumoniae or Hib,
the minimal duration is 14 days.
{{

•

Surgical Therapy
Indications for surgical therapy should be defined (Box 5).
• Interventions:
{{ Drainage of subperiosteal abscess
{{ Decompression of intra-medullary cavity
• Complete removal of all necrotic tissues
• Splint application to prevent muscle spasm and patho­
logical fractures.

Physiotherapy for Prevention of
Contractures and Early Mobility
Prognosis
•

When the pus is drained and appropriate antibiotic therapy
is given, improvement in signs and symptoms is rapid
Failure to improve or worsening by 72 hours, requires
review of the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, need
for surgical intervention or correctness or diagnosis
Acute phase reactants (ESR and CRP) may be helpful for
monitoring the response to therapy. Long-term follow-up
is necessary for sequelae like contractures and bone length
Meticulous following to algorithm 1 is quite rewarding in
most cases.

Long bones are commonly involved in acute osteomyelitis in
children. The unique anatomy and circulation of the ends of
long bones (hair-pin bend of blood vessels) result in sluggish
circulation and localization of blood borne bacteria. Acute
osteomyelitis in neonates and infants is commonly associated
with septic arthritis due to peculiar vascularity of physis and
epiphysis. Bacteria are the most common pathogens in acute
osteomyelitis in children. Staphylococcus aureus is the most
common infecting organism in all age groups, including
newborns. Sickle cell anemia, penetrating injuries, nosocomial
infections, certain skin infections, and immunocompromised
like conditions are known to have association with very specific
organisms responsible for acute osteomyelitis.
The clinical manifestations of acute osteomyelitis in
children are highly dependent on the age of the patient. Fever,
signs of toxemia, and irritability are more common in neonates.
Pain, pseudoparalysis, limp, refusal to walk, local edema,

Ch-51.indd 239

erythema, tenderness, and cellulitis are other manifestations.
There are no specific laboratory tests for osteomyelitis.
Leukocytosis with polymorphonuclear reactions, signi­ficantly
raised ESR and CRP are very common. Blood culture should
be routine in all cases of suspected osteomyelitis. Aspiration
for Gram stain and culture is the definite diagnostic technique.
Radio imaging studies play a crucial role in evaluation of
osteomyelitis. Plain radiograph shows lytic bone changes after
7–14 days of onset infection. Do not wait for plain radiographical
changes for diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis, it is very late.
Soft tissue edema may be evident after 5 days of infection.
Ultrasonography is simple, inexpensive and very sensitive for
subtle signs like subperiosteal edema and soft tissue swelling.
Ultrasonography guided aspiration is rewarding, positive in
70–80% of cases. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered
as best radio imaging technique for effective early detection
and surgical localization of osteomyelitis. Sensitivity ranges

from 90 to 100% Radionuclide bone scanning is useful when
osteomyelitis is suspected but difficult to ascertain clinically. It
is less sensitive in neonates.
The treatment of acute osteomyelitis is comprised of proper
antibiotics in optimum doses by specific route of administration,
for defined duration, usually 4–6 weeks, surgical intervention
if required and physiotherapy. Early diagnosis and prompt,
efficient management favor good prognosis.

Algorithmic Approach to Short Duration Fever
without Focus in Older Infants and Children
Suhas V Prabhu

INTRODUCTION
Fever in an older infant and child (>3 months of age) is one of
the most common cases presenting to the pediatrician (up to
half of out-patient visits). The causes may vary from something
as innocuous as a non-specific viral infection needing only
symptomatic treatment to more dangerous ones like dengue,
malaria, or bacteremic infections requiring correct diagnosis
and prompt intervention.

CAUSES
Bacteremia will be seen in between 3 and 5% of children with
fever without focus in this age group especially if the fever
is more than 39°C. While bacteremia due to organisms like
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus and Haemophilus
influenzae is more common in children younger than 2 years,
in older children, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers account
for the majority of bacterial causes. Parasitic infestations like
malaria also account for a large percentage of fevers in this age
group in certain parts of the country in certain seasons.

Approach
The clinician’s approaches to these patients need to be one
of a cautious balance between over investigation and/or
unnecessary usage of antibiotics versus the other extreme of
missing the child with serious infection who will suffer because
of delayed diagnosis and intervention. While the majority of
cases will need only symptomatic treatment and observation
for the first 2 or 3 days, the clinician needs to be alert to pick up
those who are more likely to have serious illnesses bacterial or
otherwise that need to be investigated promptly.
The first step therefore is to assess for toxicity (degree of
severity of illness). Signs of severe infection/sepsis or danger
signs requiring immediate workup and possible hospitalization
can be easily remembered by the mnemonic ABCD:
• Activity and Alertness (reduction of or Altered sensorium)
• Breathing (difficult or fast)

Ch-52.indd 241

•

Color (cyanosis, pallor, decreased capillary fill time) and
Cry (weak or high pitched)
• Dehydration (poor intake, oliguria).
Additional factors may exist that need to be considered
such as an immune-compromised patient (human immuno­
deficiency virus, asplenia, etc.), child with an indwelling foreign
body (port, shunt, prosthesis, etc.), condition predisposing to
subacute bacterial endocarditis (bicuspid aortic valve, small
ventricular septal defect, etc.), compromised due to chronic
cardiovascular disease or severe protein energy malnutrition,
latent cortisol deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and
so on. This sub-set of patients should be investigated and
treated more aggressively than the general population.
The second step is to ensure that it is truly a fever without
focus. Make an extra effort to look for a focus although in the
history or on cursory examination there is no apparent one. In
particular, look for otitis media, joint involvement, local skin
infections, rash, urinary symptoms, etc., if found appropriate
investigation and treatment should be done.
If no focus is found after a thorough history and physical
examination, and the child is not toxic, there are no risk factors,
and the temperature is less than 39°C, it is safe to observe the
child with antipyretics alone and reassess after 48–72 hours.
Parents must be informed about danger signs (ABCD listed
above) that should prompt them to return for medical reevaluation earlier. However, if the child is already suffering
with fever for the past 2–3 days and there is no focus found on
the day of presentation, then the child should be investigated
straightaway.
If otherwise, initial investigation should consist of the
following: complete blood count, acute phase reactant marker
like C-reactive protein (CRP), urinalysis and, where feasible,
blood and urine cultures. Tests for malaria (smear for malarial
parasite and/or rapid malarial antigen test) or dengue (NS1
antigen ± dengue immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M)
should be added if the epidemiology warrants.
However, additionally, if the child is severely toxic or
dehydrated or has signs of early sepsis, hospitalization

is mandatory for observation, stabilization, and prompt
empirical administration of antibiotics. Ceftriaxone at
100 mg/kg/day is usually an appropriate initial choice. On the
other hand, in situations where availability or affordability is
a problem and the child is not too sick, the initial step may be
only a complete blood count with (where appropriate) smear
for malarial parasite and a routine urinalysis. If the white
cell count is more than 15,000/mm3 or bandemia or toxic
granulation is present, a blood culture would be advisable.
Similarly, if the urinalysis shows pyuria, urine culture should
be asked for before the first dose of antibiotic is administered.
If there is leukopenia [White blood cell (WBC) count below
4,000] then possibilities of enteric fever, malaria, dengue,
and viral infection should be considered and appropriate
investigations asked for. If the WBC count is normal and
low with absolute eosinopenia and there is a very high CRP
enteric fever should be considered and blood cultures sent
before starting antibiotics.
The CBC needs to be evaluated in detail rather than only
looking for leukocytosis. Table 1 indicates possible clues to the
diagnosis from the humble CBC.
The CRP (if done) can help to distinguish bacterial
from viral fevers even on the 2nd or 3rd day of illness. But a
mildly elevated CRP can be seen in some viral infections
like adenovirus or viral infections with secondary bacterial
complications. However, a very high CRP (> 40 mg/L) is more
likely to be due to a bacterial infection and a clue to further
investigation or empirical antibiotic therapy.

Ch-52.indd 242

Clinical Pearls
• Examine thoroughly to rule out an occult focus
• In all sick children or in those with no focus even after 2–3 days
of fever, perform investigations including complete blood
count (CBC), smear for malarial parasite, C-reactive protein
(CRP), and urine routine
• Other investigations that may be asked for depending on
findings on initial investigations or clinical setting include urine
and blood cultures and dengue serology
• Careful interpretation of the CBC is important, often repeat
testing is required
• Mildly elevated CRP can be seen in viral infections
• Widal test is of no value in the first 7 days. Blood culture is the
most reliable method to diagnose enteric fever.

In certain circumstances, the first CBC may be un­
remarkable but repeat CBCs might yield the diagnosis, e.g.,
in dengue, serial CBC shows decline in the WBC and platelet
count and rising hematocrit. The widal test is of no utility in
evaluation of fever of less than 7 days duration.

Fever with Rash
Ritabrata Kundu

INTRODUCTION
Skin is the mirror of many internal ailments which may
manifest as rashes. At the outset one should determine the
types of rashes which are as follows.
Macules are flat lesions of altered color in the skin.
Papules are raised flat topped lesions with diameter of less
than 5 mm, whereas nodules are more than 5 mm in diameter
with raised rounded configuration. Vesicles are fluid filled
lesions less than 5 mm in diameter and are known as bullae
when they are more than 5 mm in diameter. Pustules are
raised pus filled lesions. Purpuras are bleeding into the skin
which are nonblanchable. When they are less than 5 mm in
diameter they are known as petechiae and if more than 5 mm
in diameter ecchymoses.
A good history in all cases must include site of onset of rash,
rate and direction of its spread. Inquire about medications
taken in recent months, history of travel, exposure to insects
and animals, immune status and immunization history.
It should also include history of any cardiac abnormality
including prosthesis, exposure to ill individual, and sexually
transmitted diseases.
Next one should determine the type of rash, i.e., its
morphology, distribution, and arrangement of the lesions. At
times, the morphology might change with passage of time for
instance in dengue the initial diffuse flushing may give away to
maculopapular rash. Also the spread of lesions should be taken
into account as maculopapular rash of dengue which starts in
the trunk spreads centrifugally to extremities and face.

CLASSIFICATION OF RASH WITH FEVER
It is broadly classified as follows:
• Centrally distributed maculopapular rash
• Peripheral rash
• Confluent desquamative rash
• Vesiculobullous rash

Approach to Managing
New Onset Fever in the Intensive Care Unit
Tanu Singhal

INTRODUCTION
New onset fever defined as fever occurring after 48 hours of
admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a patient who
was previously afebrile is generally considered as a sign of
a hospital acquired/health care associated or nosocomial
infection. However, an infection may occur without fever and
not all fever is due to infection. In certain circumstances, a
new onset fever may also be a continuum or a complication
of a community acquired infection. Approach to diagnosis and
management of this clinical entity is discussed in this chapter.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES IN DIAGNOSIS
Distinguishing Infectious from
Noninfectious Causes of Fever
It must be remembered that fever can often be the result of
noninfectious causes. Noninfectious causes of fever in the
hospitalized patient include postoperative atelectasis, drug
fever, thrombophlebitis, transfusions, deep venous thrombosis,
central fever, etc. Similarly, leukocytosis may not always be due
to an infection; noninfectious causes include stress, bleeding,
atelectasis, and steroids.

Determining the Site of Infection
Once, major noninfectious causes are excluded a thorough
clinical assessment should be made for determining the site
of infection. Common sites if infections in the ICU are blood
stream infections especially in patients who have central
lines, sinusitis/tracheobronchitis/pneumonia in patients on
invasive ventilation, urinary tract infections in those who have
indwelling catheters, surgical site infections in postsurgical
patients and sometimes enteric infections. Clostridium difficile
is less common in children as compared to adults. Central
nervous system (CNS) infections and intra-abdominal sepsis
should be also considered in children with predisposing

Ch-54.indd 246

procedures/interventions at these sites. Occult sites of infection
include sinusitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. Eliciting
symptoms referable to a particular system is often difficult in
very sick children but should be done whenever possible. A
head to toe assessment should be done with careful inspection
of the central line, exit site of central venous, respiratory
system, nature of tracheal secretions, abdomen, bones, joints,
examination of neck stiffness and surgical sites and the skin.
It is important to disrobe and examine the entire skin as these
might show areas of cellulitis, eschars, and pustules which
often indicate bacteremia/fungemia.

Distinguishing Infection from Colonization
in the Nosocomial Setting
An important issue in managing nosocomial infections is
to differentiate infection from colonization. In several ICUs,
surveillance cultures are sent from nonsterile sites like
endotracheal tubes, central line ports, urinary catheters, and
EVD drains. These will always grow microbes as these sites are
inevitably colonized. It is important that these colonizations
are not treated with antibiotics as treating colonization will
not prevent infection and only contributes to selection of
resistant organisms. Unless an infection is suspected, no
surveillance cultures should be sent. More difficult is to
differentiate infection from colonization, in the setting when
fever is associated with positive cultures from nonsterile sites.
Here careful interpretation is needed to ascertain whether the
positive culture is colonization or true infection.

INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH
The initial investigations include a complete blood count and
peripheral smear evaluation with acute phase reactants such
as C-reactive protein (CRP)/procalcitonin. Signs of sepsis
include neutrophilia/neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, shift
to left/bandemia and toxic granules in the neutrophils. While
CRP has limited sensitivity/specificity for diagnosing sepsis,

11/19/2016 4:04:38 PM

Chapter 54: Approach to Managing New Onset Fever in the Intensive Care Unit
a serum procalcitonin level of more than 2 ng/mL is highly
specific for serious bacterial infection in a previously stable
patient. Procalcitonin can also be high due to previous surgery/
trauma/burns, etc.
At least two aerobic/one aerobic and one anaerobic culture
should be sent. If there is a central catheter then one culture
should be sent from the catheter lumen and the other from
peripheral venipuncture. Increasing the volume of blood
cultured by sending two sets of culture (four bottles) increases
the sensitivity. Confirmation of the diagnosis of a catheterrelated bloodstream infections (CRBSI) involves isolation
of the identical organism with the same antibiogram from
simultaneous cultures; one obtained through peripheral
venipuncture and the other either catheter lumen blood
culture or culture of the catheter tip. A positive lumen culture
alone has poor positive predictive value for CRBSI as it may just
indicate colonization; but high negative predictive value (90%).
In all children and especially those with suspected urinary
tract infection, a routine urine analysis and culture should
be sent. Results of these investigations should be interpreted
carefully as some degree of pyuria and significant bacteriuria
(colony count of more than 105/mL may be seen in any
catheterized patient with no urinary tract infection).
For suspected hospital acquired pneumonia, cultures of
the respiratory secretions should be sent. Several methods
like quantitative endotracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar
lavage, protected specimen brush have been recommended
for diagnosis of pneumonia. Generally speaking, quantitative
cultures of endotracheal secretions are easily done and of
almost comparable yield as those of the bronchoscopic
methods. Hence, in suspected ventilator associated pneumonia
(combination of fever/leuko­cytosis/purulent secretions/new
infiltrates) quantitative endotracheal cultures should be sent
and empirical antibiotic therapy initiated.
Cultures should also be sent from other suspected sites
of infection such surgical sites, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
abscesses, etc. Care should be taken to send deep samples; skin
swabs and cultures from drains may just indicate colonization.
Imaging also assists in diagnosing site of infections. Basic
imaging includes chest X-ray and ultrasonography abdomen.
Presence of a new infiltrate on chest imaging is also not specific
enough for a pneumonia as it may be due to atelectasis,
progression of underlying lung disease, or due to thoracic
surgery. In some patients, computerized scans of the thorax
and abdomen may be needed to detect site of infection.

TREATMENT
The most important component of treatment of a nosocomial
infection is appropriate antimicrobial therapy administered as
soon as possible once sepsis is considered. However, source
control such as removal of an infected central line and drainage
of pus and supportive therapy are also crucial.

•

Local epidemiologic data: knowledge of common
microbial pathogens and their resistance profile in a
particular intensive care unit helps in making empirical
choice of antibiotics till cultures are available. The most
common etiologic agents for nosocomial infections in
India are Gram-negative pathogens including Klebsiella,
E. coli, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter. These
are followed by Gram-positive including S. aureus, S.
epidermidis and enterococci There is an increase in
infections due to fungi, mainly Candida albicans but
also non-albicans candida such as Candida tropicalis,
Krusei, Glabrata, and Parapsilosis. Most of the nosocomial
pathogens are multidrug resistant. Foremost is drug
resistance in Gram-negative pathogens with 80% of
nosocomial E. coli and Klebsiella infections being resistant
to third generation cephalosporins by virtue of production
of extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL). The
emergence of Amp C mediated resistance, traditionally
found in Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter
but now even in other Gram-negative bacilli has made
third generation cephalosporins and beta lactam-beta
lactamase inhibitor (BL-BLI) combinations ineffectual.
The fall out of ESBL and Amp C mediated resistance
has been excessive use of carbapenems in ICU settings.
Consequently, a significant proportion of Pseudomonas
and Acinetobacter isolates in certain ICUs of tertiary care
hospitals are now resistant to even carbapenems. This
has led to colistin overuse and sporadic reports of colistin
resistance. S. aureus are generally methicillin resistant,
vancomycin resistant S. aureus/enterococci are not a
problem as yet. Also seen over time with increasing use of
fluconazole for therapy and prophylaxis, is rising incidence
of non-albicans Candida infections some of which are
fluconazole resistant
Previous antibiotic usage: this again helps in predicting the
likely resistance profile of the microbe till culture results are
available. Additionally, it helps in guessing what pathogens
have not been appropriately covered till now
Severity of infection: for a patient who is critically sick or
in septic shock, a carbapenem may be needed as there is
high organism load and there is no leeway for making an
error in choice of antibiotic nor is their time to upgrade.
On the other hand, if there is doubt about the presence of
infection or there is mild infection a BL-BLI combination
may be used
Associated comorbidities: these are important consi­
derations. For instance if there is associated renal
compromise, nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides,
vancomycin, and colistin should be avoided or used with
caution
Site of the infection: in the presence of a CNS infection a
drug with good CSF penetration must be used. Hence, BLBLI combinations cannot be used as the BLI does not cross
the blood brain barrier.

Factors Determining Choice of
Antimicrobial Therapy

Initial Empirical Antimicrobial Regimes

Various factors determine the empiric choice of antibiotics and
include:

Initial empirical therapy is necessary in seriously ill patients
before culture reports are available. The choice of such

Staphylococcus aureus.

antimicrobial therapy should be carefully thought of since
studies demonstrate that inappropriate initial therapy is
associated with higher mortality. Since most nosocomial
infections in Indian ICUs are due to resistant Gram-negative
pathogens, the initial empirical regime should comprise of an
adequate Gram-negative cover such as BL-BLI combination
or carbapenems. In units with high rates of carbapenem
resistance, colistin may be required upfront in very sick
patients. An anti methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) cover should be added to the regime if there is a high
incidence of MRSA in that unit, if there are Gram-positive cocci
in the Gram stain of secretions or if there are other features
suggesting a Gram-positive infection. If risk factors for fungal
infections are present such as prolonged ICU stay, renal
failure, prolonged antibiotic use, gut surgery, renal failure, use
of corticosteroids, use of intralipids, immunocompromised
stay, extreme prematurity and isolation of candida from
multiple nonsterile sites then an antifungal should be added
either upfront or of there is failure to respond in 48 hours. The
choice of antifungal depends on previous azole exposure,
the local patterns in the unit, the severity of infection and
associated comorbidities but for most fluconazole suffices.

Dosing of Antibiotics

248

Adequate attention is needed toward administration of
appropriate doses. Higher doses may be needed for serious
infections. Time dependent antibiotics such as beta lactams
and vancomycin should be dosed frequently to maintain
serum levels continuously above the minimum inhibitory
concentration. Recent data supports administration of
beta lactams by continuous infusion. On the other hand,
concentration dependent antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides,
may be effectively dosed once a day.

Ch-54.indd 248

De-escalation
This is extremely important to prevent or mitigate antibiotic
resistance. Once culture reports are available and so indicate,
the higher level antibiotic can be switched to a narrow
spectrum one. This may mean switching from a carbapenem
such as imipenem or meropenem to a cephalosporin/BL‑BLI/
quinolone or ertapenem. Even if cultures are negative, deescalation may be practiced such as stopping the MRSA cover
if no Gram-positive pathogen has been isolated.

Duration of Therapy
Newly emerging data supports the use of short-term antibiotic
therapy (usually 7 days) for most nosocomial infections
(exception S. aureus, fungal infections and necrotizing
pneumonias). This helps in reducing the antibiotic pressure in
the unit and chances of selection of resistant pathogens apart
from reducing costs.

CONCLUSION
A new onset fever in the intensive care unit may be a harbinger
of a serious possibly drug resistant infection. It is crucial to pay
due attention to infection control strategies so that such an
event can be prevented.

Clinical Pearls
• A robust infection control program is crucial in preventing
health care associated infections
• Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is essential for improving
outcomes and reducing the burden of antimicrobial resistance
• Knowledge of local microbial flora and susceptibility helps in
designing empirical regimes.

Infant Born to Human
Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Mother
Ira Shah

INTRODUCTION
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in children is pre­
dominantly acquired as a vertically transmitted disease.
Without intervention the transmission rate from mother to
child has varied from 20 to 40%. However, this risk can be
reduced to less than 2% with effective prevention of parent to
child transmission of HIV (PPTCT) programs.
Vertical transmission of HIV can occur in utero through
placental transmission, intrapartum through contact with
infected birth canal secretions or postpartum through breast­
feeding. It is estimated that of the 30% of babies who get
infected vertically, 2% get infected in early gestation, 3% get
infected in late gestation, 15% get infected intrapartum and
10% get infected via breastfeeding.

Clinical Pearls
• Mother to child transmission of Infant Born to human
immunodeficiency virus Infected Mother occurs in 20–40%
children without intervention
• 2% get infected in early gestation, 3% get infected in late
gestation, 15% get infected intrapartum, and 10% get infected
via breast feeding

Prevention Modalities
Human immunodeficiency virus transmission from infected
mother to child is mainly prevented by antiretroviral drug
(ARV) prophylaxis to mother and baby, replacement
feeding and elective caesarean section (ECS). Antiretroviral
prophylaxis acts by reducing viral load in the mother and as
post-exposure prophylaxis to the fetus and baby. Caesarean
section before onset of labor or rupture of membranes has
been used as an intervention for PPTCT to decrease risk of
intrapartum transmission of HIV.
The goal of effective PPTCT is to ensure minimum risk
of transmission of HIV from mother to child and ensuring a

Ch-55.indd 250

healthy mother and child at the end of intervention. The year
2009 was the turning point for the prevention of postnatal
transmission of HIV where three randomized controlled trials
found that antiretroviral prophylaxis in pregnant women
and their infants coupled with breastfeeding could lead to a
significant decrease in the vertical transmission of HIV.

Clinical Pearls
Prevention modalities include:
• Antiretroviral drugs to mother during pregnancy and while
feeding
• Antiretroviral prophylaxis to baby post delivery
• Choice of feeding
• Mode of delivery

ELECTIVE CAESAREAN SECTION
Elective caesarean section has been found to decrease
transplacental hemorrhage during labor, reduce the length
of exposure of baby to vaginocervical secretions, and reduces
chances of ascending infection of HIV transmission. Studies
have found that among HIV-1 infected women not taking
ARV during pregnancy, ECS was efficacious for prevention of
mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1, and decreased
transmission by approximately 50% as compared to other
modes of delivery.
However, ECS is associated with postpartum morbidity
in the form of fever, urinary tract infection, endometritis
and thromboembolism. Also, it is more expensive and not
universally available especially in resource limited settings.
When ARV prophylaxis to mother and child are available and
replacement feeding can be issued, the added advantage of ECS
is not seen and vaginal delivery may be a safe and inexpensive
option in this setting.

Chapter 55: Infant Born to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Mother

ANTIRETROVIRAL PROPHYLAXIS
Many trials have demonstrated gradual reduction of the in
utero and intrapartum transmission rates with an increasing
length and potency of drug combinations used during
pregnancy and at delivery. In industrialized countries, highly
active antiretroviral therapy (Triple drug therapy) is used in
pregnant women as prophylaxis.

CHOICE OF FEEDING
Human immunodeficiency virus has been detected in breast
milk in cell-free and cell-associated compartments and there
is now evidence that both compartments are involved in
transmission of HIV through breast milk. Even if intra-uterine
and intrapartum transmission are significantly reduced,
postnatal transmission through breastfeeding still is an
additional risk for transmission of HIV (risk varies from 10 to
15%). This risk increases with high viral load in the breast milk,
maternal nipple lesions, mastitis, and breastfeeding for longer
than 15 months.
Replacement feeding clearly abolishes the risk of breast
milk transmission. However, replacement feeding increases
the risk of diarrheal diseases and malnutrition.
Exclusive breastfeeding for up to 6 months, however,
is associated with a threefold to fourfold decreased risk of
transmission of HIV compared to non-exclusive breastfeeding;
mixed feeding, therefore, appears to be a clear risk factor for
postnatal transmission. Various recent clinical trials have now
clearly shown that when antiretrovirals are taken through
the pregnancy and breastfeeding stage, there is a greatly
reduced HIV infection rate of 2%. This approach offers new
hope for mothers with HIV infection who cannot safely feed
their babies with replacement. It will improve the chances of
infants remaining healthy and free of HIV infection as breast
milk provides optimal nutrition and protects against other fatal
childhood diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhea.

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) 2013
GUIDELINES
The new World Health Organization (WHO) 2013 Guidelines
have suggested a once-daily three drug fixed-dose combination
of tenofovir and lamivudine (or emtricitabine) and efavirenz as
first-line antiretroviral therapy in HIV infected pregnant and
breastfeeding women which should be continued lifelong.
Infants of these mothers should receive 6 weeks of infant
prophylaxis with daily nevirapine (or twice-daily zidovudine).
Infant prophylaxis should begin at birth or when HIV exposure
is recognized postpartum (Table 1).

DIAGNOSIS OF human immunodeficiency
virus IN INFANTS BORN TO human immuno­
deficiency virus INFECTED MOTHERS
All infants born to HIV-infected mothers carry maternal
immunoglobulin G antibodies which cross the placenta freely.

These maternal antibodies may remain detectable in the
infant’s serum for up to 12–15 months after birth. As a result,
serological diagnosis of HIV infection is only reliable after 15–
18 months of age. Infants infected with HIV must be diagnosed
as rapidly as possible to ensure the early institution of therapy
to limit HIV related morbidity and to prevent opportunistic
infections. Tests that can be done for diagnosis of HIV infection
in children below 18 months of age are HIV culture, detection of
HIV proviral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Human
immunodeficiency virus culture is done from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but is technically difficult and
time consuming. It is expensive and done in research institutes.
Positive results are available by 1–2 weeks but negative results
are not reported till there is no evidence of HIV replication for
30 days. Thus, the test commonly used for diagnosis of HIV in
infants is PCR.

TIMING OF TRANSMISSION OF
human immunodeficiency virus AND
ROLE OF polymerase chain reaction
Human immunodeficiency virus PCRs are of two types: (1)
Qualitative and (2) Quantitative. The potential utility of DNA
PCR for the diagnosis of vertical HIV infection soon became
readily apparent in infants. Human immunodeficiency virus
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) PCR has been found to be highly
sensitive and specific for early diagnosis of pediatric HIV
infection. Sensitivity of HIV PCR is less at birth and sensitivity
increases rapidly to 95% at 4 weeks and to 99% at 6 months
of age. Thus, in non-breast fed infants, HIV PCR can be done
at 4–6 weeks after birth. In breastfeeding populations, HIV
PCR should be done after 1 or 2 months after cessation of
breastfeeding. HIV PCR can be done on dried blood sample
transported to a laboratory on a filter paper or on whole blood.
False positive and false negative results with HIV DNA PCR
may occur. The authors have reported a very high incidence of
false positive HIV DNA PCR (75%) especially in younger infants
in their study. Repeating the PCR on independent samples
may be required to reduce the test errors. One of the reasons
stated for the false positive results is contamination. Optimal
PCR conditions, inclusion of control samples, strict rules on
sample preparation, pre- and post-PCR handling, repetition
of results, confirmation of specificity by hybridization, choice

251

Section 6: Infectious Diseases
of material from which HIV-1 is amplified, and the primers
used for amplification will all predict the reliability of HIV
DNA PCR. Thus, diagnosis of HIV should never be based on
one result but should always be confirmed by a repeat test.
Serological diagnosis at 18 months with HIV enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay would also be useful.

Children born to HIV-infected mothers should be adminis­
tered prophylaxis with trimethoprim sulfa­
methoxazole
beginning at age 4–6 weeks. Prophylaxis should be dis­
continued for children who are subsequently determined not
to be infected with HIV. HIV-infected children and children
whose infection status remains unknown should continue to
receive prophylaxis for the first year of life.

DIAGNOSIS OF human immunodeficiency
virus IN CHILDREN ABOVE 18 MONTHS OF AGE
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is the time-tested
reliable method for detection of anti HIV antibodies with a
sensitivity of more than 99.5% and specificity of 99%.

Clinical Pearls
• Diagnosis in children less than 18 months—human
immunodeficiency virus polymerase chain reaction
• Diagnosis in children above 18 months—human immuno­
deficiency virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

COTRIMOXAZOLE PROPHYLAXIS
Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is safe, inexpensive, and highly
effective in reducing morbidity and mortality among HIVinfected infants and children, as well as in adolescents and
adults. Ideally, all infants exposed to HIV should be started
on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis during the first 4–6 weeks of
life, as recommended by the WHO. This period is particularly
critical for HIV-infected infants. Providing cotrimoxazole
prophylaxis protects against serious, often fatal, oppor­tunistic
infections (OIs). It has also been recognized that cotrimoxazole
prophylaxis provides benefits beyond the prevention of
pneumocystis pneumonia.

While interventions to prevent MTCT of HIV can dramatically
reduce the risk of pediatric infections to less than 2% with
continuation of breastfeeding.

Fever of Unknown Origin
Raju C Shah, Tanu Singhal

DEFINITION
The definition of fever of unknown origin (FUO) is fever more
than 101°F lasting for 3 weeks or more for which no cause is
apparent after 1 week of outpatient investigation. A practical
definition of FUO is simply fever more than 101°F measured on
several occasions over a 7-day period.

CAUSES
The principal causes of FUO are listed in box 1. Infections
account for most of the cases of FUO in children (60–70%).
Most common among infectious causes are enteric fever,
malaria, pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and
urinary tract infections. Malignancies especially leukemia
and autoimmune diseases chiefly juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis (JRA) account for the remaining cases. Relatively
rare causes include drug fever, temperature dysregulation,
diabetes insipidus, sarcoidosis, ectodermal dysplasia,
sensory autonomic neuropathies, etc. Even with extensive
investi­gations the cause of FUO remains undiagnosed in 10–
20% of the cases.

Box 1: Causes of fever of unknown origin
Infectious causes
• Enteric fever, Malaria, Urinary tract infections, Tuberculosis,
Chronic hepatitis, HIV, Hidden abscesses (liver, pelvic), Mastoiditis,
Sinusitis, Osteomyelitis, Meningitis, Infectious mononucleosis,
Infective endocarditis, Brucellosis, CMV, Toxoplasmosis, Kala azar
Autoimmune causes
• Systemic onset Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, Kawasaki disease,
Systemic lupus erythematosus, Inflammatory bowel disease,
Polyarteritis nodosa
Malignant causes
• Leukemia, Lymphoma, Langer Han Cell histiocytosis

Ch-56.indd 253

APPROACH TO fever of unknown origin
The first step is to identify sick patients who need stabilization
and urgent referral to a tertiary care center. Subsequently, all
attempts should be made to reach an etiologic diagnosis. A
detailed history is of paramount importance. History should
include:
• Whether and how fever was documented (it is not
uncommon to find children with history of prolonged fever
not to have fever documented by a thermometer)
• Duration and pattern of fever (distinguish from recurrent
fever)
• Symptoms referable to all organ systems, weight loss
• History of recurrent infections, oral thrush [human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection]
• History of joint pain, rash, photosensitivity (autoimmune
disease)
• History of contact with tuberculosis and animals
(brucellosis)
• Travel to endemic zones (kala azar)
• Drug history particularly anticholinergics (drug fever).
History is followed by a complete physical examination.
Documentation of fever is necessary, followed by assessment
of general activity, nutritional status, and vitals. A head to toe
examination, after removing all clothes, is vital. The physical
examination should be repeated on daily basis as new findings
may emerge that provide a clue to the etiology. One must keep
Kawasaki disease (though a relatively uncommon illness) in
mind as here diagnosis before the 10th day of fever is crucial to
prevent coronary complications.

Investigations and Management
Preliminary investigations, which should be repeated in all
patients with FUO (even if done earlier) include complete
blood counts (CBC), peripheral smear (PS), malarial parasite,
ESR, blood cultures, Widal test, chest X-ray, tuberculin test,
urinalysis and culture, hepatic transaminases, and abdominal

11/19/2016 4:13:38 PM

Section 6: Infectious Diseases

254

ultrasound. The CBC and PS will help in the differential
diagnosis. If the counts are low or normal, enteric fever, malaria
and viral infections are a possibility. A high white blood cell
(WBC) count with neutrophilia indicates a bacterial infection/
pus collection, possible Kawasaki’s disease, systemic onset JRA
or even tuberculosis. A high WBC count with lymphocytosis
suggests a mononucleosis syndrome or a hematologic
malignancy. Absolute eosinopenia is indicative of an acute
bacterial/viral infection particularly enteric fever. A low platelet
count points toward malaria, enteric fever or a malignancy
whereas a very high platelet count is present in Kawasaki’s
disease or systemic onset JRA. The usefulness of an erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) as an investigative modality in
prolonged fever is often debated. It is not a sensitive or specific
investigation. Studies show that one-third of pulmonary
tuberculosis had a normal ESR. Exceptionally, a very high ESR is
indicative of an autoimmune process such as Kawasaki disease
or JRA. The C-reactive protein (CRP) parallels ESR and may not
help to differentiate a viral from bacterial etiology. However, a
very high CRP points to a bacterial infection or autoimmune
disease. Evaluation for malarial parasite is a must. Repeated
thick smears are gold standard for diagnosis and may be sent
irrespective of the fever spike. However, in a setting where
reliable microscopy is not available, the malarial antigen tests
may be used; the parasite lactate dehydrogenase tests score
over the histidine rich protein 2 based tests. The blood culture
is a crucial investigation in this setting as enteric fever is the
most common differential. Though, it should be sent prior to
starting antibiotics, the yield is fair for Salmonella even if the
patient is on antibiotics. If infective endocarditis is suspected
then three blood cultures at 30 minutes interval should be sent
and if brucellosis is being considered as a differential then the
lab should be informed so that the cultures are incubated for
longer and not discarded within 5 days. Widal may be sent
as it is the 7th day of fever, but the results should be carefully
interpreted. It may be considered positive if both TO and
TH/TA titers are 1: 120/ 1: 160 or more. Either TO/TH being
positive or titers of 1: 40/80 should be considered as false
positive. Similarly a negative Widal does not rule out enteric
especially if the patient has been on antibiotics. Typhidot M
or Tubex tests do not offer any advantage over the Widal and
are not routinely recommended. Liver enzymes both aspartate
aminotransferase (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase
(SGPT) should be assayed as these are often elevated in
malaria, enteric, infectious mononucleosis, and brucellosis;
SGOT being higher than SGPT. Urinary tract infection is a
diagnostic possibility and hence urine routine is mandatory.
Features of urinary tract infection include presence of one
or more of the following: more than 10 pus cells/hpf of
centrifuged urine, positive leukocyte esterase, positive nitrite
tests, and presence of bacteria on the Gram stain. If the urine
routine is suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI) then
urine culture should be sent before starting antibiotics. This
is to confirm the diagnosis and also to know the antibiotic
susceptibility of the isolate. A chest X-ray should also be done
to pick up pneumonia or features of pulmonary tuberculosis.
An ultrasonography abdomen with pelvis is recommended as

Ch-56.indd 254

an initial investigation as it helps in detecting a liver abscess,
gall bladder wall thickening and sludge (often seen in enteric
fever), pyelonephritis, and retroperitoneal adenopathy. Nonspecific mesenteric lymphadenopathy is a common finding
and usually merits no consideration. The author does not
recommend doing a tuberculin test at this point if there is no
clinical or radiologic suspicion of tuberculosis and unless more
common causes such as enteric are ruled out. This is because
a positive tuberculin test at this juncture may be indicative of
latent tuberculosis infection and may not be causally associated
with the fever.
If a diagnosis is established on the basis of the above
approach, appropriate treatment should be instituted. If
no diagnosis is made, clinical reassessment and further
investigations are merited. While second line investigations
are being planned and executed, treatment with intravenous
ceftriaxone may be considered as enteric fever is an important
cause of FUO in our country, especially in those cases with
negative clinical/preliminary investigations (Algorithm 1).
Second-line investigations include HIV enzyme-linked
immuno­­sorbent assay, contrast enhanced computed tomo­
graphy of chest and abdomen, bone marrow histology and
cultures, 2D echocardiogram, complement level, antinuclear
and rheumatoid factors, tissue biopsies if indicated. Other
serologic tests that may be done include brucella serology,
hepatitis B surface antigen, Paul Bunnel/Monospot test/
immunoglobulin M viral capsid antigen (VCA) for infectious
mononucleosis. Tests which are of no clinical value include
serology and polymerase chain reaction in blood for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other organisms.

Clinical Pearls
• Infections particularly tuberculosis is the commonest cause for
fever of unknown origin in India
• A high index of suspicion should be kept for diagnosis of
Kawasaki disease
• Empirical therapy should be avoided as far as possible
• The diagnosis often evolves with time and patience is the key.

))
Tuberculosis serology has no place in the diagnosis of FUO
))
With patience and application of methods, it should be possible
to make a diagnosis of the etiology of FUO in most cases

))
In a small number of cases, it may not be possible to arrive at
the etiologic diagnosis. In such cases, periodic reassessments
should be done as the disease may finally surface (e.g.,
lymphoma, systemic onset juvenile eheumatoid artheits).
Some cases of FUO may self-resolve over time
))
Empirical use of steroids should be avoided.

Key points

A practical definition of fever of unknown origin (FUO) is fever
for which a cause cannot be established despite 1 week of
investigations

A detailed history and physical examination is most crucial.
This should include travel history, contact with tuberculosis
and animals
))
The primary objective is to identify sick children and prompt

A Mass in the Abdomen:
The Way to Diagnosis
Gauri Kapoor

INTRODUCTION
The identification of an abdominal mass in a neonate or child
is a cause for concern because of the possibility of malignant
disease. In addition, even benign conditions can be serious
and warrant prompt evaluation and treatment. Hence, the
pediatrician needs to be wary of these masses and give them
urgent attention.
Although abdominal masses could be any one of the
following:
• Fluid
• Fat
• Flatus
• Solid mass.
For the purpose of this chapter we will focus on solid
abdominal masses.

PRESENTATION
Children with abdominal masses may be asymptomatic or
symptomatic at diagnosis as shown in box 1. The asymptomatic
cases may be incidentally picked up on a routine prenatal
ultrasound or detected by a family member or alert pediatrician
during an immunization visit. The general presentation varies
depending on the underlying pathology of the abdominal
mass. Patients can present with difficulty with urination or
defecation if the mass physically obstructs the gastrointestinal
(GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract. Patients presenting with
constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss with
an abdominal mass are more likely to be suffering from a
malignant condition. Neuroblastoma and Wilms’ tumor are
two conditions pediatricians must be vigilant about as they are
the two malignant tumors in children where abdominal mass
is commonly the initial presentation.
Although it is imperative that a child be referred quickly to
the appropriate specialist (e.g., pediatric oncologist, pediatric
surgeon, nephrologist, gastroenterologist, gynecologist),
evaluation by the pediatrician is of great value in deciding

• Congestive heart failure, hydramnios, fetal hydrops
• Bowel obstruction, urinary retention

on initial management and in making the most appropriate
referral. The evaluation of a child with an abdominal mass
involves a number of possibilities and depends to some extent
on the age and sex of the patient, the location of the mass, and
the presence or absence of other potentially related signs and
symptoms, as well as features of the physical examination.
Determination of the organ or tissue of origin of the mass can
narrow down the diagnostic possibilities considerably. Thus,
a completion of a careful history and physical examination,
baseline laboratory studies, and limited diagnostic imaging
studies can provide sufficient information to determine the
diagnosis or to choose the appropriate subspecialist and
counsel the family.
Clues to diagnosis based on:
• Age and sex
• Location of the mass
• Organ of origin
• Signs and symptoms
• Examination findings
• Investigative workup (limited).
Some of the common conditions that might produce
an abdominal mass in a child are listed in table 1 and are
categorized by the organ of origin. Abdominal masses in the

the location and type of mass, and features of the history or
physical examination.
The differential for an abdominal mass can be extensive
and quite daunting, as it incorporates many systems including
the GI, GU, and endocrine system. An organized approach
to abdominal masses includes thinking about possible
etiologies based on the location of the mass with regards to the
underlining abdominal anatomy as well as discerning likely
pathologies based on the age of the patient and associated
symptoms or signs.

Clinical Pearl
• Most abdominal masses in neonates are benign unless they
are solid.

HISTORY
When attempting to diagnose an abdominal mass, a proper
history with a focused physical exam is necessary to direct you
to the proper diagnostic tests to order, or the right specialist to
refer too (i.e., pediatric oncologist, surgeon, gastroenterologist,
nephrologists, or gynecologist).

Age
The age of the patient is very important when approaching
abdominal masses in the pediatric population and should be
the first question asked. Malignant tumors are uncommon
in the newborn period. These conditions are often related
to the kidney. Posterior urethral valves are manifested
during the newborn period by a very large urinary bladder.
Hydronephrosis secondary to distal obstruction may result
in a unilateral or bilateral flank mass. A multicystic kidney
also may be found at this time. Other considerations include
developmental abnormalities, such as duplications or cysts
of abdominal organs. Amongst the malignant conditions,
neuroblastoma and extragonadal germ cell tumors are most
common, followed by hepatoblastoma and Wilms’ tumor.
Moreover, of the malignant conditions, children younger
than 2 years are more likely to suffer from neuroblastoma and
hepatoblastoma, whereas older children more frequently have
Wilms’ tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma, GU tract tumors, and
germ line tumors.
Other important points to be noted in history are detailed
in table 3.

look for in a child with abdominal mass. One must be patient
as physical examination in young children can be a difficult
proposition. Table 5 lists some of the important clinical findings
to look for during examination.

INVESTIGATIONS
All children with abdominal masses should have a complete
blood count and peripheral smear examination as it may throw
up important clues to diagnosis. Further investigations would
include baseline chemistries and specific tumor markers on
the basis of the clinical differential diagnoses (Table 5).

IMAGING
An abdominal mass in children is often first assessed by
a plain abdominal radiograph to rule out GI obstruction.
Next, an ultrasound study is helpful and can be done
without sedation. It is noninvasive, easily available and fairly
inexpensive and is sometimes the first investigation done
for an abdominal mass. It can usually identify the organ of
origin of the mass, such as the kidney, adrenal gland or liver,
etc. and helps differentiate solid from cystic masses. Further
information is provided in table 6.
An algorithmic approach to evaluation of a child with
abdominal mass is depicted in algorithm 1. Once a malignancy
is suspected it is recommended that the child be referred to
a pediatric oncology unit, since early diagnosis of pediatric
cancers are associated with very good cure rates. Delayed
diagnosis not only reduces the chances of cure but is also
associated with higher complication rate. Parents should,
therefore, be appropriately counseled at this time and the
pediatrician has a very important role to play in bridging the
gap between the family and the oncology center.

Approach to a Child
with Persistent Anemia
Mamta V Manglani

INTRODUCTION
Anemia in children is the most common cause of referral
to a pediatric hematology-oncology clinic in our country.
It reflects the disturbance of the dynamic balance between
production and destruction of erythrocytes and hemoglobin.
In normal subjects, the average life span of red cell, i.e., time
between the release of red cell from bone marrow and its
disappearance from circulation is between 100 and 120 days.
Approximately 1% of the red cells are destroyed each day and
replaced by new cells released from marrow. Any disruption
of this balance, such as reduced production or increased
destruction, leads to anemia.

DEFINITION OF ANEMIA
Anemia is defined as a reduction in the red cell mass and/
or reduction in hemoglobin or hematocrit. A child is said to
be anemic when the hemoglobin and/or hematocrit is two
standard deviations below mean for normal population. This
results in 2.5% of normal population being classified as anemic.
On the other hand, some of the anemic individuals would be
classified as normal and these would only be recognized after
a response to treatment.

Table 1 gives the normal values (normal mean, lower limit)
of various hematological parameters at different age groups.
The initial diagnostic approach to the anemic patient
should include detailed history, physical examination, and
screening laboratory tests followed by specific laboratory tests
as indicated to confirm the diagnosis.

HISTORY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF ANEMIA
Age
Nutritional anemia is uncommon below the age of 6 months
(especially in term breastfed infants), except in preterm infants.
Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is most common in the age group
of 6 months to 3 years and 11–17 years (adolescent) age group.
Dietary habits and food fads may be responsible for anemia in
adolescent period. Development of anemia is almost always
insidious in children and may go unnoticed till hemoglobin
concentration drops to as low as 3–4 g/dL, particularly in
nutritional anemia. Hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia major)
commonly present during 6–18 months of age and rarely
before that age.
Anemia manifesting in the neonatal period is generally
as a result of blood loss, including fetomaternal hemorrhage,

fetofetal hemorrhage and occult hemorrhage, or due to
hemolysis as a result of isoimmunization, uncommonly
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency,
spherocytosis or due to congenital infections.

Clinical Pearls
• A neonate with hemoglobin of 11 g/dL is severely anemic,
whereas a 1-year-old infant with same hemoglobin is normal
• When interpreting presence or severity of anemia, age plays
an important role.

Gender/Family History/Inheritance
Though nutritional anemia is more common among females
during adulthood, the incidence is equal in both genders
during childhood. Certain inherited anemias are transmitted
as X-linked recessive and hence are commonly seen in male
children. This includes G6PD deficiency; hence similar history
of anemia should be enquired in other male siblings, maternal
male cousins, maternal uncles, and maternal grandfather.
Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant disorder,
whereas hemoglobinopathies like thalassemia, sickle cell
anemia, etc. are inherited as autosomal recessive conditions.
It is important to enquire about family history of anemia,
jaundice, gallstones, splenectomy, etc. in the other members
of the family. A history of consanguineous marriage is also
helpful in recessive conditions. Hence a detail pedigree chart
including the family members, who have expired, should
be obtained.

anemia due to folate deficiency may be seen in children fed
predominantly goat’s milk. Nutritional anemias are commonly
seen in adolescent females due to various food fads.

History of Drug Ingestion
Certain drugs cause hypoplasia of the bone marrow. Some of
these are chloramphenicol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, sulfonamides, heavy
metals, etc. Oxidant-induced hemolytic anemia may occur in
people having G6PD deficiency (sulfonamides, antimalarials
such as primaquine, quinine and mefloquine, vitamin C
and K, furazolidone, nalidixic acid, etc.). Penicillins and
cephalosporins, a-methyldopa, stibophen, etc. are known to
precipitate autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Certain drugs
can cause megaloblastic anemias due to altered metabolism
of folate and vitamin B12. These include phenytoin, folate
antagonists, etc.

Infections and Infestations
History of intrauterine infections (Toxoplasmosis, Rubella,
Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex and Other Agents) should
be elicited when dealing with neonatal anemia, especially
when associated with hepatosplenomegaly, purpura, etc.
Hepatitis-induced aplasia and infection-induced pure red
cell aplasia or hemolytic anemia (malaria) need to be kept in
mind. Anemia also may be associated with chronic infections
like tuberculosis, tropical sprue, kala-azar, or with chronic
inflammations like collagen disorders, malignancies, etc.
Anemia due to worms, especially hookworms, is common in
developing countries.

Community

Diarrhea

Certain types of anemias are known to occur in particular
communities. G6PD deficiency is commonly seen in
Parsees, Punjabis, and Sindhis, whereas thalassemia is
common amongst Sindhis, Punjabis, Lohanas, Bhanushalis,
Kathiawadis, Mahars, Agris, Bauddhas, Kolis, Lingayat, Reddys,
and Gaud communities. Sickle cell anemia is more commonly
seen in hilly and tribal communities especially around Nagpur,
Vidharbha, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, etc. hemoglobin E is seen
more in Eastern India among Bengalis and hemoglobin D in
Punjabis and North Indians.

Malabsorption syndromes due to varied causes could be a
cause for nonresponding nutritional anemias.

Dietary History
Nutritional anemias are associated with poor dietary intake
of iron, folic acid, proteins, and vitamin E in the diet. Breast
milk contains lesser quantities of iron; however, it has a very
high bioavailability. Hence, IDA is uncommon in exclusively
breastfed infants before 4–6 months of age. Inadequate iron
containing weaning foods and/or predominantly milk-based
diet beyond 4–6 months of age contribute significantly to
occurrence of IDA in late infancy. History of pica may be
present as a cause or effect of IDA. Lead toxicity should be
ruled out in such children if there is a history of exposure to
lead directly or through parents’ occupation. Megaloblastic

EXAMINATION FINDINGS AS
A CLUE TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF ANEMIA
Skin
Hyperpigmentation is common with Fanconi’s anemia,
dyskeratosis congenita, megaloblastic anemia, etc. (Fig. 1).
Petechiae and purpura may be present in aplastic anemia,
leukemias, hemolytic uremic syndrome, etc. Leg ulcers are
seen in chronic congenital hemolytic anemias such as HbS
and HbC disease and occasionally in homozygous thalassemia
(Fig. 2). Cavernous hemangiomas may be associated with
micro­
angiopathic hemolytic anemia. Jaundice suggests
hemolytic anemias, hepatitis-induced aplasia.

Facies
Presence of hemolytic facies is seen in congenital hemolytic
anemias such as thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia and
occasionally in severe chronic IDA (Fig. 3).

261

SECTION 7: Hematology/Oncology

Eyes
Fanconi’s anemia may have microphthalmia and micro­
cornea, besides microcephaly (Fig. 4). Cataracts may suggest
galactosemia with hemolytic anemia in the neonatal period.
Vitreous hemorrhages are seen in sickle cell disease and retinal
hemorrhages may occur in severe chronic anemias. Edema of
the eyelids should make one suspect infectious mononucleosis,
or exudative enteropathy with iron deficiency. Visual loss may
be one of the features of osteopetrosis. Blue sclera is often a
feature of IDA (Fig. 5).

Hands and Nails

anemia

262

Thumb anomalies suggest constitutional hypoplastic anemias
(Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Fanconi’s anemia) (Figs 6 and 7).
If associated with radial anomalies, it is more likely to be
Fanconi’s anemia. Presence of platynychia and/or koilonychias
(Fig. 8) are pathognomonic of IDA.

CHAPTER 58: Approach to a Child with Persistent Anemia

Clinical Pearls
• Presence of blue sclera, platonychia or koilonychias, and/or
angular stomatitis suggests iron deficiency anaemia
• Iron deficiency anemia is a manifestation and not an etiological
diagnosis.

Mouth
Glossitis is seen in vitamin B12, folate, and iron deficiency;
angular stomatitis (Fig. 9) and bald tongue are seen in iron
deficiency. Occasionally, gum hypertrophy (Fig. 10) may
be seen in a patient with acute promyelocytic or acute
myelomonocytic leukemia.

263

SECTION 7: Hematology/Oncology

LABORATORY APPROACH TO ANEMIA

Clinical Pearl
• Presence of lymphadenopathy, gum hypertrophy, and
hepatosplenomegaly should prompt exclusion of malignancies
especially in presence of affection of other cell lines, i.e., white
cells and platelets.

Lymphadenopathy
Lymphadenopathy would prompt one to consider various
malignant disorders, such as leukemias, lymphomas, metastatic
malignancies such as neuroblastoma, infections such as
tuberculosis, infectious mononucleosis, human immuno­
deficiency virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), etc. (Fig. 11).

Hepatosplenomegaly
Presence of hepatosplenomegaly almost always rules out
hypoplastic anemia except the infiltrative causes of marrow
suppression. It suggests hemolytic anemias, the infiltrative
causes such as leukemias, osteopetrosis, myelofibrosis,
myelodysplasias, etc. (Fig. 12).

Fig. 11: Lymphadenopathy in a case of lymphoma

The investigations in children with anemia should be done
in a phased manner as expensive confirmatory tests may be
useless and unnecessary in concluding the cause of anemia,
unless done judiciously. Therefore, it is imperative to follow
a stepwise testing to get a better yield without spending the
patient’s money unnecessarily.
Investigations should be done as follows:
• Screening tests
• Definitive diagnostic tests.

Screening Tests
Screening tests include:
• Complete blood count including hematocrit and blood
indices
• Reticulocyte count
• Examination of the peripheral smear.

Complete Blood Counts
•

Hemoglobin: the severity of anemia can be gauged with the
value of hemoglobin
• Hematocrit: it is useful in neonates to diagnose poly­
cythemia. In sickle cell disease, it is important to maintain
the hematocrit at 30–35%
• Red cell indices: these include mean corpuscular volume
(MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red
cell distribution width (RDW). This helps in typing the
anemia.
Based on MCV, MCH, and MCHC, anemias can be classified
into three categories to give a morphologic classification.
Besides, the RDW further elucidates the cause of anemia.
Along with the findings of the peripheral smear findings, most
anemias can be categorized completely with a few specific
confirmatory tests.
• Microcytic, hypochromic anemia—MCV <80 μ3, MCH <27
pg, and MCHC <32%
• Macrocytic anemia—MCV >95 μ3
• Normocytic, normochromic anemia—MCV 80–95 μ3,
MCH 27–32 pg, and MCHC 32–36%.
Red cell distribution width: it is the measure of the degree
of anisocytosis. This is calculated from the histogram of MCV
and expressed as a coefficient of variation. The normal values
are 11.5–14.5%. Along with MCV, it can help categorize anemias
further. The relationship of MCV and RDW is given in table 2.

Hemoglobin distribution width (HDW): it is obtained
from the histogram of MCHC and depicts the hemoglobin
distribution. Combining MCV, RDW, and HDW can offer better
categorization of anemias. However, most automated cell
counters presently used in our country do not have the feature
of HDW.

Reticulocyte Count
As reticulocytes are the immediate precursors of mature red
blood cells (RBCs), their presence in the peripheral blood
reflects the marrow activity in response to anemia. Reticulocyte
count is expected to be high in children with anemia if they
have a responsive marrow. Therefore, one needs to consider
whether the reticulocytes have increased proportionate to the
degree of anemia. This is done by calculating the corrected
reticulocyte count as:
Reticulocyte count × Observed HCT
Desired HCT

Fig. 13: Microcytic, hypochromic smear in iron deficiency anemia

Example: If the reticulocyte count of a child is 6% and
the HCT is 15%, the corrected reticulocyte count would be as
follows: 6 × 15/45 = 2%, which is not as high as it seems.
Polychromasia and basophilic stippling on peripheral
smear are indirect evidences of reticulocytosis.
Reticulocyte count is increased in hemolysis, hemorrhage,
or after starting therapy for nutritional deficiencies. However,
it is low or normal in nutritional anemias and it is below 1% in
bone marrow suppression.

Clinical Pearls
• Reticulocyte count is a window to the bone marrow and if
normal to increased suggests the pathology does not exist in
the marrow
• Red blood cell indices along with red cell distribution width
and reticulocyte count can help diagnose many of the causes
of anemia.

Peripheral Smear Examination
This is the single most important, cost-effective test for
anemia. It not only suggests the type of anemia but also gives
the clue to the underlying cause and disease. The following
morphologic information can be obtained by reviewing a
peripheral blood smear:

Confirmatory Tests

ALGORITHMS TO DIAGNOSE ANEMIA
BASED ON VARIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Methods to diagnose anemia based on various investigation
are represented in algorithms 1–3.
ALGORITHM 1
Microcytic, hypochromic anemia

HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography..

ALGORITHM 2
Macrocytic anemia

These would be based on the screening test results. As per the
algorithms given below and the suspected diagnosis, these
confirmatory tests should be performed or ordered.
These include Coomb’s test, G6PD estimation, osmotic
fragility and flow cytometry for membrane defects, bone
marrow aspiration and biopsy, high-performance liquid
chromatography for hemoglobinopathies, serum iron studies,
ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate levels as well as blood lead
levels. Besides these, certain corroborative tests such as serum
bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobins, etc. also assist in diagnosing the
cause of anemia.
Occasionally, workup for a-thalassemia, unstable hemo­
globins, rare hemoglobin variants, cytogenetics, and other
RBC enzyme levels may be required.
ALGORITHM 3
Normocytic, normochromic

CONCLUSION
With detailed history taking and relevant clinical examination,
basic screening tests, and minimum specific tests, it is possible
to diagnose the type of anemia and institute appropriate
treatment. This approach would definitely help in minimizing
the need for useless and expensive tests in children with anemia.

Algorithmic Approach to
Thrombocytopenia in Children
ATK Rau, K Shreedhara Avabratha

INTRODUCTION
Platelets are discoid, non-nucleated cells of 2–3 mm in
diameter and 5–9 fL in volume, produced in the bone marrow
by fragmentation of megakaryocytes. Each megakaryocyte
produces about 4,000 platelets. These platelets circulate in the
blood for about 7–10 days and are subsequently culled by the
spleen and bone marrow. The main function of the platelet is
the formation of a platelet plug at the site of vascular injury
(primary hemostasis). The normal range of platelet count is
between 150,000/cumm and 450,000/cumm.
Thrombocytopenia is defined as platelet count of less
than 150,000/cumm. However, clinically significant thrombo­
cytopenia is defined as any count less than 100 × 109/L;
furthermore, it is considered severe if the platelet count is
below 30 × 109/L, moderate if it is between 30 × 109/L and 50 ×
109/L, and mild (and usually asymptomatic) if above 50 × 109/L.

CLINICAL FEATURES
The clinical features of thrombocytopenia are due to the
defect in primary hemostasis. It is clinically suspected when
there is history of easy bruising or bleeding. Petechiae,
purpura, epistaxis, gum bleeding, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds,
hematuria, and menorrhagia are some of the important
presenting features. Intracranial bleeding, though rare, is one
of the dreaded complications of low platelet counts. Deep and
intramuscular bleeds are uncommon with thrombocytopenia
and generally indicate a coagulation disorder, if encountered.

CAUSES
The causes of thrombocytopenia are many and broadly fall
under three categories.
1. Decreased production of platelets—either congenital or
acquired
2. Increased destruction of normally synthesized platelets—
which could be due to immune or nonimmune causes
3. Sequestration of platelets in various organs.

ch-59.indd 269

Decreased Platelet Production
•
•

Pancytopenia: leukemia, bone marrow infiltration, hypo­
plastic anemia, viral infections [e.g., human immuno­
deficiency virus (HIV)], drugs, and radiation
Isolated thrombocytopenia: rare congenital defects—
thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome, WiskottAldrich syndrome, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombo­
cytopenia, giant platelet disorder, e.g., Bernard-Soulier
syndrome, viral infections like HIV, Epstein-Barr virus.

Increased Destruction
•

•

Immune: immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)—
the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in
children, neonatal thrombocytopenia (alloimmune or
autoimmune), and autoimmune disease—systemic lupus
erythematosus, drugs like heparin
Nonimmune: malaria, dengue, disseminated intra­­vascular
coagulation (DIC), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),
sepsis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), etc.

Platelet Sequestration
Mainly in the spleen as in hypersplenism due to infections,
storage disorders, and portal hypertension.

Physical Examination
Fever and toxic appearance may suggest infection, malig­nancy,
DIC, TTP. The type and extent of bleeding is to be noted. An
absent radius or upper limb deformity, chronic eczema, and
recurrent infections are clues to various causes of congenital
thrombocytopenia. Lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly may
suggest malignancy, HIV, and infectious mononucleosis.
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is conspicuous by the
nonoccurrence of splenomegaly. Arthritis, mouth ulcers, or
a characteristic rash may suggest autoimmune or collagen
vascular illness. Features of renal failure like edema,
hypernatremia, and hypertension may be noted in HUS.
Abnormal neurological examination should alert one to the
possibility of an intracranial bleed or TTP.

Algorithm  1
Approach to thrombocytopenia

Investigations
Causes for mucocutaneous bleeding are many and specialized
testing for platelet disorders can be expensive and difficult to
perform. However, before resorting to any of these tests, it is
important to eliminate spurious “pseudo” thrombocytopenia
by the direct finger prick peripheral smear examination.
Pseudo (or spurious) thrombocytopenia is an in vitro
artifact where platelets clump together due to poor quality
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid used as an anticoagulant. As
a result, the platelet counts appear to be decreased. A repeat
count with another anticoagulant will resolve the problem.
Further investigations will include:
• Complete blood count: will distinguish between
pancytopenia and isolated thrombocytopenia
• An increase in mean platelet volume (MPV, normal 5–9 fL)
will suggest increased turnover (e.g., in ITP where in the
bone marrow attempts to replace peripherally destroyed
platelets by younger larger platelets quickly) or hereditary
giant platelet syndromes while small platelets (low MPV)
suggest decreased platelet production and the WiskottAldrich syndrome
• Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy is essential to differentiate
ITP from leukemia and other infiltrative disorders when
doubts arise clinically. Normal or increased megakaryocytes
seen in the marrow in ITP will help resolve the issue
• Other clinically relevant investigations, e.g., specific
serological titers for various infections and cytogenetic
assessment for inherited disorders.
Algorithms 1 and 2 represent a simplified approach to
thrombocytopenia.

TREATMENT

270

ch-59.indd 270

Treatment involves management of the underlying cause.
Platelet transfusions are often performed to tide over the
crisis. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is the most
common cause of acute thrombocytopenia in a well child and
the treatment involves observation, intravenous immuno­
globulins, steroids, and others. In children without significant
clinical bleeding, serial platelet counts will help decide the
course of therapy to be adopted.

Algorithmic Laboratory
Approach to a Child with Anemia
Aarathi R Rau

INTRODUCTION
Anemia is a condition in which there is a reduction in the total
circulating red cell mass below normal limits and consequent
decreased oxygen carrying capacity that is insufficient to meet
the body’s physiologic needs. It is a common problem in India,
and the National Family Health Survey III data showed the
prevalence of anemia among children less than 5 years of age
to be around 70% with nearly 73 million children below the age
of 3 (79%) suffering from varying degrees of anemia.
Anemia is measured by reduction in the volume of packed
red cells as measured by the hematocrit and reduction in the
hemoglobin concentration below the normal for the age and
gender of the individual. These values correlate with the red
cell mass, except when there is change in the plasma volume
caused by fluid retention or dehydration.

DIAGNOSIS OF ANEMIA
Basic investigations are done to document the presence of
anemia and classify it according to morphology and function.
Thereafter, based on the differential diagnosis and clinical
features, specific diagnostic tests are indicated that help
establish the etiology and pathophysiology of anemia. The
initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood
count with red cell indices, reticulocyte count, and study of a
well-prepared peripheral blood smear.

CLASSIFICATION OF ANEMIA
Anemia is a manifestation of the underlying disease, which
must then be determined and treated accordingly. The
common mechanisms of anemia are decreased production,
decreased lifespan of red cells, blood loss, and splenic pooling.
However, if the cause is not readily apparent from clinical
features, evaluation based on morphology and function is
a well-established approach. Morphological classification
of anemia is based on the red blood cell (RBC) indices that
reflect the RBC volume [mean corpuscular volume (MCV)]
and hemoglobin content [mean corpuscular hemoglobin

ch-60_copy.indd 272

concentration (MCHC)] and divided into microcytic
hypochromic, normocytic, normochromic, and macrocytic
anemia. As children (other than neonates) have smaller
erythrocytes than adults the determination of MCV and
subsequent classification of anemia must be determined by
age-related ranges. Morphological classification is useful as
the differential diagnoses of microcytic hypochromic anemia
and macrocytic anemia are limited.
The functional classification is based on the number of
reticulocytes produced as a response to anemia. Reticulocyte
count can be corrected depending on the degree of anemia
and the extent of stress/shift reticulocytosis to derive the
reticulocyte production index (RPI), an index of bone marrow
proliferation and its response to the degree of anemia. In
hyperproliferative anemias seen in blood loss and hemolytic
anemias, the RPI is greater than 2. In untreated thalassemia
major, however, the reticulocyte count may be low. In
hypoproliferative anemias and maturation defects seen in
deficiency anemias, anemia of chronic disease, endocrine
deficiencies, sideroblastic anemias, aplastic anemia, and
myelodysplasia, the RPI is less than 2. The morphological
classification combined with the functional classifications
and the differential diagnoses thereof are applicable to the
majority of anemias. Unusual patterns may occur while the
anemia is not fully developed, when there is a combination of
causes, the patient is under treatment or in an unusual cause
of anemia.

USE OF AUTOMATED BLOOD
COUNTING INSTRUMENTS IN ANEMIA
Automated counters are widely available and have improved
accuracy, precision, and reliability compared to manual
methods. Most modern automated blood-counting instru­
ments give the complete blood count which includes
hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC indices, white blood cell
(WBC), and platelet counts which are useful in the initial
morphological diagnosis of anemia. Red cell distribution
width (RDW) is a measure of anisocytosis and normally

Approach to anemia

reticulocyte count reflects the increased production of
reticulocytes as a response of the erythropoietic elements
of the bone marrow to anemia or treatment and is more
useful than the manually counted reticulocyte percentage.
In some automated counters, the immature reticulocyte
fraction, which reflects the early reticulocyte fraction and the
reticulocyte hemoglobin, which reflects the iron supply in the
bone marrow, are also available.
Certain indices either numerical or computational can
be calculated from data derived from automated counters,
e.g., Mentzer’s index, which is useful in the differentiation
of thalassemia minor from iron deficiency anemia can be
calculated.

a heterogeneous population. Study of the volume histograms

which can be correlated with the peripheral smear. Absolute

Examination of RBC morphology on a blood smear is
important in diagnosing the type of anemia, assessing
anisocytosis, and correlating it with the RDW. Smear
examination can assess poikilocytes, the most specific being
sickle erythrocytes. Erythrocyte inclusions when present
are at times useful in determining the cause of anemia like
Howell-Jolly bodies seen in some hemolytic anemias and
Pappenheimer bodies in sideroblastic anemia. Evaluating the

morphology of the WBCs may be useful in diagnosing certain
anemias like megaloblastic anemia and other hematological
diseases where anemia is secondary to another cause,
e.g., leukemia. Examination of a peripheral smear is also
invaluable in the diagnosis of malaria, a common cause of
anemia. Data from automated counters may be correlated
with peripheral smear findings.

Microcytic RBCs are usually associated with decreased MCHC
and are, therefore, microcytic hypochromic. Iron deficiency is
the most common cause of microcytic hypochromic anemia
but microcytic hypochromic anemia can also occur in
thalassemia minor (both α and β), in the late stages of anemia
of chronic disease, sideroblastic anemia, hemoglobin C and
hemoglobin E, and other rare causes. Beta-thalassemia
major and intermedia and hemoglobin H disease also
cause microcytic hypochromic RBCs; however, their clinical
features and peripheral smear findings are usually significant
enough for them not to be included in the differential
diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. In iron deficiency
anemia, the RBCs are microcytic hypochromic with moderate
anisopoikilocytes. The platelet count is usually on the upper
level of normal and reticulocyte response is usually identified
3 days after institution of iron therapy. Iron studies will show
decreased serum iron and ferritin and increased total iron
binding capacity. Serum transferrin receptor assay (sTFR)
is useful in detecting and differentiating iron deficiency

is important as an increase (usually a value of between 4 and
7%) is considered diagnostic of β-thalassemia trait. If, after
evaluation of the common causes, a diagnosis has not been
reached, unusual causes like lead toxicity may be considered.

APPROACH TO MACROCYTIC ANEMIA
Macrocytic anemias are those where the MCV is greater than
100 fL. Macrocytic anemias may be megaloblastic or nonmegaloblastic.
In megaloblastic anemia, examination of the peripheral
smear will show macro-ovalocytes and hypersegmented
neutrophils. Increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase,
unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin indicate
ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis. The MCV is usually
greater than 120 fL and there is likely to be decrease in the RBC,
WBC, and platelet counts. The bone marrow in megaloblastic
anemia shows nuclear: cytoplasmic asynchrony and giant
metamyelocytes, however, bone marrow examination may
not be essential for the diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia.
Megaloblastic anemia may be due to folic acid, vitamin
B12 deficiency which may be due to decreased absorption,
inadequate nutrition, defects in metabolism, or increased
requirements. Other causes include defects in purine and
pyrimidine synthesis either inherited or acquired as in
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), drug induced or associated
with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
In nonmegaloblastic anemia, the MCV is usually mild and
between 100 and 110 fL and the WBC and platelets are usually

normal. Causes of nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia
include hypothyroidism, liver disease, and rare conditions like
pure red cell aplasia, and aplastic anemia. The smear shows
round macrocytes and may show features of the underlying
cause like target cells and stomatocytes in liver disease.
Correlation with clinical and laboratory tests for the causative
disease must be done to confirm the cause.
Hemolytic anemias and blood loss may also have raised
MCV due to reticulocytosis which can be excluded by
reticulocyte count and peripheral smear examination.

NORMOCYTIC NORMOCHROMIC ANEMIA
The causes of normocytic anemia are many. Depending
on the RPI, they can be categorized into anemia with
hyperproliferative or hypoproliferative marrow. Normocytic
anemia with hyperplastic marrow (>2 RPI) present from
birth are usually due to some nonthalassemic hemoglobin­
opathies, RBC enzyme, or membrane defects. In addition to
peripheral smear examination and tests for increased turnover
of cells, further tests like hemoglobin electrophoresis can
characterize the disease. Rare causes of hemolysis including
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and Wilson disease
must be confirmed by specific tests. Normocytic anemia with
hypoplastic marrow (<2 RPI) can be seen early in the course
of iron deficiency, renal disease, liver disease, endocrine
disorders, chronic inflammatory disease, and anemia
secondary to medications. In these conditions, specific tests

smear and direct Coombs’ test.

following clinical evaluation will confirm the diagnosis.
Primary hematological conditions may also present with
hypochromic anemia and these include MDS, aplastic anemia,
pure red cell aplasia, and leukemia. Evaluation of the bone
marrow will be useful in confirming these diagnoses

ANEMIA IN THE NEWBORN
Anemia in the newborn differs from those in children in that
the level of hemoglobin is higher (16–22 g/dL at birth), the
MCV is higher (average 107 fL at birth) and the reticulocyte
count is higher (3–7%) in the newborn compared to children.
The etiologies that are uncommon in older children that need
to be considered in a newborn include congenital disorders,
metabolic disorders, intrauterine infections, ABO/Rh
incompati­bility, and internal hemorrhage.

Clinical Pearls

276

• The final diagnosis in anemia must be done after correlating
the laboratory test results with patient history, symptoms, and
physical examination
• Results of laboratory tests should be interpreted with an
understanding of the limitations of the test and the variations
with respect to age, gender, sample collection, etc.
• All laboratory investigations should be interpreted in
relation to the reference range established in that individual
laboratory using blood samples from the local population.

Recurrent Unusual Infections in
a Child: The Way Forward
Tulika Seth

INTRODUCTION
Children are immunologically immature more prone to many
infections compared to adults. More than six infections per year
are suspicious of an immunodeficiency status, though some
studies report 4 to 8 may be normal. So when is it warranted to do
special and extra investigations in a child? Repeated infections
with the same bacterial organism, serious infections of the
lower respiratory tract, repeated diarrhea, recurrent urinary
tract infection, and repeated pyogenic infections all warrant a
detailed history and evaluation. Unusual organisms causing an
infection should also get special attention. Before we discuss
recurrent unusual infections, it is important to understand what
are recurrent infections and unusual organisms.

DEFINITIONS
Recurrent or Repeated Infections:
Common Causes
The child referred for repeated or recurrent infection needs a
detailed history. Often a common mistake is to assume cases
of repeated infections, when in fact it is a case of inadequate,
improper, or incomplete treatment of a previous infection.
Compliance, dosage of antibiotics, and all culture reports
should be checked. Home environment, smoker at home,
going to a crèche, etc. can predispose to recurrent infections
in an otherwise normal child. The vaccination history and
documentation of vaccines is important. Malnutrition is the
most common cause of decreased immunity, hence nutritional
parameters should be checked. Any anatomic malformation,
gastroesophageal reflux, congenital masses, and foreign body
aspiration may also be a cause of repeated infections. Atopic
dermatitis may lead to skin infections due to scratching the
pruritic rash. Other systemic disease, e.g., sickle cell, nephrotic
syndrome, etc., needs to be evaluated, if previous illness, then

ch-61.indd 277

medications should be checked as the child may be on steroids
or other immune-suppressants. Occasionally, the recurrent
infection can lead to the diagnosis of unsuspected condition
like cystic fibrosis or a previously missed congenital heart
disease, etc. Most common infections in children are viral, of
short duration, and do not compromise growth. Children with
inherited conditions like Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome,
etc. are also more susceptible to infections. Family history of
other family members prone to infections (siblings, parents),
history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) needs to be
taken. If none of the above then a primary immunodeficiency
disorder may be the cause of the condition.
In neutropenic patients, there are frequent bacterial and
fungal infections. Though they present with fever, the classic
signs of infection are often less marked due to neutropenia,
hence a high index of suspicion is needed.

Unusual Infections: Causes
An unusual infection may be either an uncommon setting, or a
rare organism. These are warning flags to investigate a child for
immunodeficiency disorders or undiagnosed systemic disease
like malignancy. Certain signature infections can help pinpoint
the type of immune defect (Box 1).
• If presented with an unusual organism, rule out conta­
mination and obtain a detailed history of travel, exposure
to pets, medication leading to immune-suppression, and
previous courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics
• If a usual setting, rule out underlying undiagnosed disease
such as malignancy, metabolic or systemic disease, HIV,
malnutrition, or undisclosed use of steroids or other
immune-suppressive medicines.
As seen by the above discussion, all children with recurrent
infections do not have a primary immune deficiency disorder. It
is important to rule out secondary immunodeficiency as these
can be treated easily (Table 1) leaving the primary immuno­
deficiency child who needs a more detailed investigation.

Key Features of Unusual Recurrent Infections
•
•

Not all children with recurrent infections have a primary
immune deficiency disorder
Immunodeficiency should be suspected if
{{ Six or more new infections within 1 year
{{ Two or more sinus infections or pneumonias in 1 year
{{ Two or more episodes of sepsis or meningitis
{{ Two or more months of oral antibiotics without
resolution of problem.

WARNING SIGNS OF IMMUNE-DEFICIENCY
Presence of oral candidiasis, tissue or organ abscesses,
and opportunistic infections all warrant investigation. A
complication from a live vaccine, in the child or elder siblings
and family history of siblings with history of early death or
similar presentation are important.
The immunodeficiency may be secondary or primary.
Secondary immune-deficiencies are due to contributing
malnutrition, chronic disease, prematurity, cancer, HIV, etc.
The type and pattern of recurring infections depend on which
components of the immune system are affected (Box 1). History
(Table 1) and examination (Box 2) give clues and signature
infections help highlight disorders (Table 2). Initial steps with
workup of the child is represented in algorithm 1.

GENERAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination in children with recurrent infections
provides information as to their general health and may suggest
the presence of allergy, chronic disease, or immunodeficiency.
A dysmorphic appearance may signify an underlying genetic
syndrome. Dark circles under the eyes, a transverse nasal
crease, and congested nasal turbinates suggest allergy. Mouth
ulcers, gingivitis, and mucosal candidiasis may be due to
an immunodeficiency state. Diminished or absent tonsils
and cervical lymphadenopathy with a history of recurrent
respiratory infections suggest an antibody deficiency
diagnosis. The presence of nasal polyps suggests cystic fibrosis,
and confirmatory testing should be performed.

Table 1: Historical details useful in differentiating between cases of suspected primary or secondary immunodeficiency
Primary immunodeficiency
History
• Feeding history, history of food intolerance
• Delayed detachment of the umbilical cord should be noted since
persistent attachment beyond 30 days is suggestive of a leukocyte
adhesion defect

278

Secondary immunodeficiency
• Birth history: pregnancy history should be explored for
maternal illness (e.g., HIV, CMV), birth history should include
length of gestation, birth weight, and neonatal problems
such as jaundice, respiratory distress, or need for intensive
care. Transfusions in the neonatal period should be recorded

Growth
• Weight, height, and head circumference should be plotted and followed over time. Children with chronic disease or immuno­deficiency
often have poor weight gain or even weight loss. Children with chronic lung, heart, or gastrointestinal disease are often small because of
anorexia, high energy expenditure, or malabsorption caused by infection or bacterial overgrowth
Development
• Children with ataxia-telangiectasia and DiGeorge syndrome can have
• Children with HIV, and TORCH may have delays in
delayed developmental milestones

Primary immunodeficiency
Immunization history
• See for adverse effects from a vaccine, particularly live virus. The
immunization record is valuable to see vaccine titers to evaluate
antibody function
Medications
• If immunoglobulin has been given, the route, dose, frequency, and
adverse effects should be noted

Other illnesses
• Other immune problems such as allergies, anaphylaxis, arthritis, or
autoimmunity may give a clue to diagnosis

Secondary immunodeficiency
• The immunization record is valuable to see vaccine titers to
evaluate antibody function

• Current and past medications should be recorded, including
duration, effectiveness, and adverse reactions. Use of any
immunosuppressive medications, such as glucocorticoids,
should be noted
• Severity of prior chicken pox, roseola, and other febrile
illnesses should be noted
• Ask about surgery and hospitalizations

Family history
• Consanguinity, family members with similar diseases, recurrent
infections, unexplained death, or autoimmune disease
• Autosomal recessive pattern in ataxia-telangiectasia
• X-linked transmission (e.g., agammaglobulinemia, chronic
granulomatous disease)

• HIV, TB
• Other similar problems in siblings, or other family members,
parental health, and occupation

Infection history
• The infection history should include the age of onset, duration, frequency, sites, organisms, treatment, and response to therapy
Age of onset
• Birth to 6 months:
• Birth to 6 months:
{{ Several immune-deficiencies: congenital neutropenia, severe
{{ Infections shortly after birth may be due to prolonged
combined immunodeficiencies, and complete DiGeorge syndrome
rupture of membranes, congenital infection, or aspiration
{{ Persistent diarrhea, chronic cough, or failure to thrive suggests cystic
{{ Premature infants are at high risk for sepsis
fibrosis or a primary immunodeficiency
{{ Inherited antibody deficiencies present at 7 -9 months, as the
maternal IgG decreases. Infants with TLR3 transduction may present
with herpes simplex encephalitis.
• 2–6 years:
• 2–6 years:
{{ Less serious antibody deficiencies (e.g., immunoglobulin A deficiency
{{ Secondary immune-deficiencies resulting from
and selective antibody deficiency) present at this age. Two or more
malignancy, nephrotic syndrome, or gastrointestinal
episodes of bacterial meningitis or sepsis suggest a complement or
problems, malabsorption often begin at this age
{{ Daycare or school will result in frequent respiratory and
other innate immune defect
gastrointestinal infections
HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; CMV, cytomegalovirus; TORCH, Toxoplasmosis, Other, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes infections; TB, tuberculosis.

Box 2: Examination findings to look for in a child with recurrent infections
Skin
• See breach of skin barriers due to prematurity, atopy, chronic eczema, burns, wounds, fistula and sinuses. Several immunodeficiency
syndromes are also associated with eczema, including Wiskott-Aldrich, hyper immunoglobulin E, Omenn syndrome, and severe combined
immunodeficiency disease (SCID)
• Cutaneous granulomas, impetigo, or nonhealing ulcers suggest the diagnosis of an antibody or phagocytic disorder. Pyogenic abscesses are
common in chronic granulomatous disease, or leukocyte adhesion defects
• Oculocutaneous albinism is seen in Chédiak-Higashi disease
• Rashes: seborrheic dermatitis and alopecia can be seen in some forms of SCID, or may be found in other conditions like Langerhans cell
histiocytosis. Lupus-like rash in the children with early complement component defects. A dermatomyositis-like rash is found in X-linked
agammaglobulinemia (XLA)
• Extensive warts or molluscum contagiosum occurs in T cell disorders, innate immune defects, or a rare entity called Warts,
Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections and Myelokathexis syndrome
Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly
• Immune deficiency disorders can be characterized by paucity or even overabundance of lymphoid tissue (e.g., tonsils, lymph nodes,
adenoids, spleen). The absence of lymph tissue suggests XLA or SCID
• Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly can be seen in B cell disorders (e.g., common variable immunodeficiency, IgA deficiency) and
also in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection
• Suppurative adenitis is common in chronic granulomatous disease

LABORATORY EVALUATION

280

ch-61.indd 280

Laboratory evaluation of children with recurrent infection
should be directed by history and physical examination
findings (Table 1, Box 2, Algorithm 2), before evaluating for
primary immunodeficiency diseases exclude secondary
immunodeficiency, which are more common. General
screening tests should include the following to exclude
systemic disease: complete blood count with differential
electrolytes, glucose, renal and liver function tests, urinalysis,
autoimmune workup, and HIV testing. The evaluation for
primary immunodeficiency should focus on the component

•

The total absolute lymphocyte count is a useful test
(lymphopenia is defined as a count of <1,500 cells/µL
in patients over 5 years and <2,500 cells/µL in younger
children). The presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia,
or an abnormal differential count warrants further
investigation
Neutropenia and absolute neutrophil count should be
checked:
WBC (cells/µL) × percent (PMNs + bands)
ANC =
100
	  Other important blood cells to be evaluated are
eosinophils; if increased, suggest an allergic state. Platelet
size and number should be seen as they are useful—small
platelets seen in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, etc. However,
thrombo­cytosis is less specific and only points to chronic
inflammation
Chest X-ray, computed tomography scan: this will assist in
documenting serious infections like pneumonia, thymus
size, presence of mass in chest predisposing to infection,
bronchiectasis, etc. This may suggest a diagnosis of
previously unsuspected etiology
Immunoglobulin levels: immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM,
IgA, and IgE, must be compared with age-matched
controls for children. An antibody deficiency is suggested
by an IgG less than 200 mg/dL and a total Ig (IgG plus
IgM plus IgA) less than 400 mg/dL, or by the complete
absence of IgM or IgA (after infancy). A small increase of
IgE (>100 IU/mL) can occur due to allergy, eczema, or with
phagocytic dysfunction. In hyper IgE syndrome, the level of
IgE are generally greater than 2,000 IU/mL

Antibody titers, complement screening test: functional
assessment of the antibody system can be done by
checking antibody titers to vaccines that the child has been
documented to have received. Titers to tetanus, diphtheria,
and Haemophilus influenzae type b are available for
reference. Response to polysaccharide antigens can be
determined by measurement of pneumococcal titers (12–
14 serotypes) in children over the age of 2 years
Complement activity needs to be assessed in patients with
recurrent sepsis due to neisserial infection. The screening
test is a total hemolytic complement determination
(CH50). A normal CH50 level excludes nearly all hereditary
complement deficiencies.

Diagnostic Tests
Specific testing is indicated when screening tests are abnormal
or if there is a convincing history or family history suggestive
of an immunodeficiency. The patient should be referred to a
special center for diagnostic tests and management.
• Lymphocyte subset analysis: by flow cytometry for CD3
(total T cells), CD4 (T helper), CD8 (T cytotoxic), CD19
(B cells), and CD16/56 (natural killer cells), compared with
age-matched controls (B or T cell defect)
• An absolute CD4 count of less than 500 cells/µL in a child
over 5 or less than 1,000 cells/µL in younger children
(suggests a cellular immunodeficiency)
• An absolute B cell (CD19) count of less than 100 cells/µL
can be seen in children with agammaglobulinemia
• Low levels of any lymphocyte subset should be repeated
and if still decreased, followed by functional analysis of the
respective subset
• Immunoglobulin G subset levels can be tested if the
patient has low total IgG levels and poor antibody response
to vaccinations. A complete absence of IgG1, IgG2, or
IgG3 suggests immune dysregulation, and may indicate
the early onset of common variable immunodeficiency.
However, a low level of only one or more IgG subclasses
does not make a diagnosis if an antibody deficiency, for
such a diagnosis functional antibody studies are needed

ch-61.indd 281

•

Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity is a good functional in
vivo test of T cells; however, it is limited in utility as it can
be performed only in older children
• Lymphoproliferative assays are in vitro assays used to
evaluate the cellular immune system. This examines
proliferative response of lymphocytes to mitogens
(phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed), stimulatory mono­
clonal antibodies (anti-CD3), etc. Defects in this assay
suggest a T cell defect
• Phagocytic oxidative response is evaluated by a fluores­
cent dye (dihydrorhodamine) by flow cytometry. Chronic
granulomatous disease gives a negative test. This is more
accurate than the nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction
assays
• Leukocyte adhesion defect testing: cases presumed to
suffer from leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) can be
evaluated by flow cytometry evaluation of cell surface
marker expression of CD11 and CD18. These are absent
in LAD I and CD15a is absent in LAD II. However, patients
with LAD III have normal integrin expression and
demonstration of impaired integrin activation, is needed
• Complement component: if the screening test shows
very low or absent CH50 activity on repeat testing then
complement component assays are indicated
• Confirmatory diagnostic studies: many immune defects
have their molecular tests available; these tests are usually
performed in specialized labs. A definite diagnosis by
molecular testing helps in treatment, prognosis, and
genetic counseling. Genetic diagnosis is available for the
majority of disorders commercially and confirmatory tests
should be done in conjunction with a specialist as these
tests are expensive.
Confirm the neutropenia on a manual peripheral smear
stained with Wright-Giemsa stain and perform a bone
marrow test. For cyclic neutropenia, there will be recurrent
infections and a regular oscillation in the neutrophil count at
approximately 21 day intervals. Other causes of neutropenia
are given in table 3.

Approach to Persistent Fever with
Hepatosplenomegaly in a Child
Anupam Sachdeva, Vinod Gunasekaran

INTRODUCTION
Hepatosplenomegaly is a common clinical finding seen
in infants and children presenting with fever. Hepato­
splenomegaly can be associated with a variety of clinical
conditions including infectious, hematological, malignant,
congestive, storage disorders, connective tissue disorders,
and other miscellaneous conditions. Fever can be associated
in a majority of these conditions. Hence, a thorough history,
clinical examination, and relevant laboratory investigations
help the clinician in arriving at an early diagnosis and to
initiate appropriate treatment. This chapter discusses in
detail regarding a practical approach to a child with fever and
hepatosplenomegaly and a simplified algorithmic approach is
provided in algorithm 1.

HEPATOMEGALY
A liver that is palpable clinically does not always indicate
hepatomegaly. Liver can normally be palpable in infants and
young children. It can also be displaced inferiorly by pathology
involving diaphragm or thoracic organs, giving the impression
of hepatomegaly. Hence, the liver span measured by percussion
is more reliable and it should be more than the expected for the
corresponding age to consider as hepatomegaly. The normal
range for liver span by percussion at 1 week of age is 4.5–5 cm.
At 12 years, the normal value for boys is 7–8 cm and for girls is
6–6.5 cm. The normal range of liver span in various age-groups
include: infants, 5–6.5 cm; 1–5 years, 6–7 cm; 5–10 years, 7–9
cm; and 10–15 years, 8–10 cm. Hepatomegaly generally occurs
via five mechanisms:
1. Inflammation
2. Excessive storage
3. Infiltration
4. Congestion
5. Obstruction.
Infections from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites
promote inflammation-induced hepatomegaly. Toxins,

ch-62.indd 283

radiation, autoimmune disease, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia
also may cause hepatomegaly by this mechanism. Metastatic
infiltration occurs in leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma,
and histiocytosis. Extra­medullary hematopoiesis and hemo­
phagocytic syndrome cause hepatomegaly due to infiltration
by blood cells. Hepatomegaly due to other mechanisms may
not be associated with fever usually.

Clinical Pearl
• Liver can normally be palpable in young children. Enlarged
liver span signifies hepatomegaly.

SPLENOMEGALY
Spleen becomes clinically palpable only after it enlarges two to
three times its normal size. Splenomegaly can be classified into
three grades based on the size enlarged below the left costal
margin, i.e., mild, (1–3 cm), moderate (4–7 cm), and massive
(>7 cm).

Clinical Pearl
• A soft, thin spleen can be palpable in 15% of neonates, 10% of
normal children and 5% of adolescents.

Causes of persistent fever with hepatosplenomegaly in a
child:
• Infectious:
{{ Viral
–– Infectious mononucleosis
–– Congenital Toxoplasmosis, Other Agents, Rubella,
Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Simplex (TORCH)
infections
–– Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
–– Herpes simplex infections
–– Dengue
–– Viral hepatitis

of children presenting with fever and hepatosplenomegaly
in tropical countries. Pallor, jaundice, anorexia, rashes, and
abdominal distension are the common associated complaints.
Lymphadenopathy is a common associated finding. These
signs and symptoms help in making a differential diagnosis
and guide initial investigations.

Clinical Pearl
• In tropical regions, infections remain the common cause of
fever with hepatosplenomegaly.

HISTORY
Evaluating a child with fever and hepatosplenomegaly starts
with a complete history. The etiology may differ depending
on the patient’s age group. Acute leukemia usually presents in
the age group of 2–10 years. In an infant, a careful birth history

11/19/2016 5:03:46 PM

Chapter 62: Approach to Persistent Fever with Hepatosplenomegaly in a Child
including birth weight may uncover risk factors for perinatally
acquired infections that include hepatitis B, toxoplasmosis,
syphilis, cytomegalovirus, rubella, herpes simplex, enterovirus,
rubella, and HIV. In older children, careful questioning about
travel, insect exposure, ingestion of drugs, and environmental
toxins may reveal risk factors for acute hepatitis or certain
infections. Epidemiology of the patient gives clue for certain
diseases like kala-azar, which is localized to certain parts of the
country (Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh).
A prodrome of upper respiratory infection is seen in EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) infections. History of myalgia or arthralgia may
be seen in viral infections and in leptospirosis. History of bony
pain and tenderness is seen in acute leukemia. Acute onset of
hepatomegaly associated with hyperbilirubinemia in an older
child raises the suspicion of infection with hepatitis A. Previous
history of recurrent infections may give a clue to underlying
immunodeficiency. History of raw milk consumption may
be associated with Brucellosis infection. Systemic symptoms
related to chronic inflammatory diseases should be sought in
the older child. History of contact with tuberculosis or a person
with chronic cough is an important clue for a young child
presenting with disseminated tuberculosis. Previous history
of repeated transfusions, jaundice, gallstones may be a clue
for an underlying hemolytic anemia, now presenting with an
acute infection. Family history suggestive of a similar illness or
a recent infectious illness may be a clue for a communicable or
a hereditarily predisposed illness. Other nonspecific signs and
symptoms include fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, blood in the
stool, and abdominal distension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
A careful physical examination often narrows the diagnostic
considerations. Neonatal history of intrauterine growth
retardation, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, and purpura
accompanied by hepatomegaly strongly suggests congenital
infection. Presence or absence of associated rash and the type
of rash give rise to a different set of differential diagnosis. Viral
exanthems are by far the most common cause of fever with
rash in children. Among them, dengue, dengue-like illnesses,
Herpes simplex infections, infectious mononucleosis, etc.
can have associated hepatosplenomegaly. Among bacterial
infections, S. typhi, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections,
borreliosis, and brucellosis can have similar set of clinical
findings. Connective tissue disorders like systemic lupus
erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis can also manifest
skin rashes. Presence of lymphadenopathy is usually seen in
the above clinical conditions. Lymphomas can present with
fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy without
other manifestations.
Petechial rash may be seen in dengue hemorrhagic fever
and meningococcal infections. Petechial, purpuric, and
ecchymotic rashes can be seen in fulminant sepsis with DIC
or in malignant conditions like acute leukemia. Bleeding
manifestations can be seen in dengue, severe malaria, DIC, and
acute leukemia. Other findings to be looked for include pallor,
jaundice, edema, and evidence of third spacing, evidence of
malnutrition, and involvement of other organ systems.

Clinical Pearl
• Detailed history, complete physical examination, and having
knowledge about infections prevalent in the locality and their
mode of presentations help in guiding initial investigations.

INVESTIGATIONS
Investigations should be tailored for every patient based on the
clinical clues attained from history and clinical examination.
Otherwise, investigations may be misleading, diagnosis may
be delayed and the treatment cost would increase.

Initial Investigations
Initial investigations in most patients would include:
• Complete blood count with differential count and a
peripheral blood smear examination. It gives important
information about the cell lines involved and the degree
of cytopenia or elevated counts. A peripheral smear
might show blasts, activated lymphocytes, evidence of
hemolysis, or malarial parasites which may be of diagnostic
importance
• Liver functions, renal function tests (if required), in a child
with signs of liver or renal dysfunction or in any sick child
• Workup for common infectious causes including blood and
urine cultures, serology against infections like Salmonella,
Brucella, Rickettsia, leptospirosis, dengue, viral hepatitis
markers, and EBV, as indicated by the clinical clues and the
current epidemiological pattern of infectious diseases in
the patient’s locality
• Multiple smears especially during febrile episodes must
be sent in a child with compatible clinical picture of
malaria. Although Plasmodium falciparum is most likely
to be identified from blood just after a febrile paroxysm,
the timing of the smears is less important than their being
obtained several times a day over a period of 3 successive
days. A single negative blood smear does not exclude
malaria; it may be necessary to repeat the smears as often
as every 4–6 hours a day to confirm the diagnosis. Most
symptomatic patients with malaria will have detectable
parasites on thick blood smears within 48 hours. Rapid
diagnostic tests (RDT kits) are available for malaria, that
can be done bedside without any equipments with good
sensitivity and specificity. Presently, National Vector-Borne
Disease Control Programme supplies RDT kits for detection
of P. falciparum at locations where microscopy results are
not obtainable within 24 hours of sample collection.

Imaging of Abdomen
Abdominal ultrasound should be considered early in a child
who is toxic with tender hepatomegaly to rule out pyogenic
liver abscess. Ultrasound may also give information
regarding mesenteric lymphadenopathy, minimal ascites,
evidence of intestinal tuberculosis, etc. in selected cases.
Granulomatous lesions are detected as hypoechoic lesions
in liver and spleen.

Other Investigations

•
•
•

•

•

•

•

Congenital Toxoplasmosis, Other Agents, Rubella,
Cytomegalo­virus, and Herpes Simplex screen may be sent
in neonate or an early infant with low birth weight
Workup for tuberculosis including chest X-ray, Mantoux,
sputum, or gastric lavage for acid-fast bacilli must be
considered in a malnourished child or with a subacute
or chronic presentation or a history of contact with an
open case
Human immunodeficiency virus has to be ruled out in a
high-risk patient especially if the initial workup is negative
Recombinant K39 antigen test should be sent in a child from
an endemic area for kala-azar. This test has a sensitivity and
specificity close to 100%
Autoimmune etiology should be considered in an older
child with rashes, arthralgia, polyserositis, or characteristic
rash. Antinuclear antibody and double stranded deoxy­
ribonucleic acid should be sent in such cases
Fungal workup including fungal cultures from blood and
urine, fungal serology, etc. may be considered in child
with underlying immunosuppression including those
on chemotherapy, myelosuppressive agents, criticallyill patients with multiple indwelling catheters, severely
malnourished children, HIV-infected children, etc
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be indicated in
children developing bicytopenia/pancytopenia or showing
abnormal cells on peripheral smear in order to rule out
hemophagocytosis or malignancy. Leishmania donovani
bodies in bone marrow confirm the diagnosis of kala-azar
Fine needle aspiration cytology/biopsy of peripheral lymph
nodes or ultrasound-guided aspiration of mesenteric
lymph nodes may be of etiological value in case of tuber­
culosis or lymphoma
Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis is usually a
diagnosis of exclusion, which is made only after excluding
common infectious etiology, autoimmune, and a malignant
process.

TREATMENT
Treatment of the underlying etiology remains the mainstay
of therapy. However, in a sick child presenting to emergency
with fever and hepatosplenomegaly, initial stabilization,
supportive care followed by intravenous (IV) antibiotics
against the common infections prevailing in the community

like enteric fever and rickettsial infections should be
initiated after sending the initial etiological workup.
Measures have to be taken to demonstrate malaria parasite
before starting empirical antimalarial therapy. However,
if clinical presentation indicates severe malaria and there
is no alternative explanation these patients should be
treated accordingly. Investigations should be continued
simultaneously till a definitive diagnosis is made and specific
therapy must be initiated.

Approach to a Bleeding Child
Nitin K Shah

INTERPRETATION OF ALGORITHM
Hemostasis is a delicate balance between fluidity of blood so
that it can circulate freely within blood vessels and coagulation
so that any breach in continuity of blood vessels can be sealed
efficiently and immediately so as not to exsanguinate the body.
This delicate balance is maintained mainly by three factors,
namely, vascular and extravascular tissues, platelets, and
plasma factors. Any disturbance in these three factors will lead
to either bleeding or excessive clotting (thromboembolism).
Successful management of an acute bleeding episode in a
child mainly depends on the ability to make a rapid diagnosis
and prompt implementation of therapeutic measures. Proper
detailed history and thorough clinical examination often
suggest the presence and type of bleeding disorder. However,
accurate diagnosis which is required for specific therapy
depends on laboratory tests. A careful history also provides
critical information in selecting subsequent tests thus avoiding
a battery of investigations. Further workup becomes necessary
when there is:
• A recent bout of bleeding: spontaneous or after injury or
surgery—usually prolonged and disproportionate to extent
of injury
• Family history of bleeding episodes
• Preparation for surgery or invasive procedures
• Systemic diseases known to be associated with bleeding
disorders, e.g., liver disorder, renal disorder, disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, etc.
Whenever a child presents with bleeding episode it is
necessary to decide:
• Whether bleeding is significant?
• Whether it is due to local causes, or whether it is a
generalized hemostatic defect?
• What is the nature of the bleeding episode? Is it due
to vascular, platelet, or a coagulation abnormality or a
combination of two or more?
• Is it congenital or acquired?

ch-63.indd 287

CLINICAL HISTORY
Local versus Generalized Bleeding
Local cause should be suspected when bleeding is from a
single site and recurs often from the same site, e.g. epistaxis
with bleeding from left nostril recurring every time from the
same nostril. Such bleeding should lead to a suspicion of local
causes such as a polyp or a foreign body. However, if bleeding is
from both nostrils or from any of the nostrils and patient gives
history of hematuria or a past history of excessive bleeding after
tooth extraction, then it is more likely to be due to a systemic
defect. Common local causes of bleeding are shown in table 1.
In generalized bleeding disorders, bleeding is spontaneous
or greater than expected for extent of injury or the site of bleeding
and bleeding is from multiple sites like skin and mucous
membrane, bleeding into interstitial tissue, muscles, joints, etc.

Platelet/Vascular Type versus
Coagulation Type of Bleeding
Bleeding following vascular disorder, thrombocytopenia, or
functional platelet disorders is usually in the form of spon­

taneous subcutaneous and mucous membrane bleeds like
petechiae, purpura, superficial, and few ecchymosis, epistaxis,
and menorrhagia. It is often controlled by pressure and once
controlled, it usually does not recur. However, in patients with
coagulation factor deficiency, hematomas are usually deep (in
the muscles) and spreading, bleeding into cavities like joints
and retroperitoneal space is known. Post-traumatic bleeds are
often delayed, sometimes hours after the injury. This may recur
and bleeding may not get controlled by pressure.

Inherited versus Acquired Causes
Inherited Causes
•

•

288

ch-63.indd 288

Age of presentation: inherited disorders usually present in
infancy and early childhood with history of bleeding from
the umbilical cord, without evidence of sepsis or slipped
ligature; spontaneous large cephalhematoma during early
neonatal period, bleeding during the eruption or fall of
deciduous tooth, etc.; exception being mild hemophilia
though inherited cause of bleeding presenting late in life say
following a surgery. Whereas acquired bleeding disorders
present at any age, usually later in life, like idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) presenting at 3–5 years
of age, exception being hemorrhagic disorder of newborn
due to vitamin K deficiency though being acquired cause of
bleeding presenting in first week of life
Family history: proper family history of bleeding disorders
of at least 2–3 generations on each side of parents (including
those who might have died) and noting the pedigree chart
helps in realizing the mode of transmission of the disorder
such as sex-linked recessive, autosomal recessive or
autosomal dominan
{{ X-linked recessive inheritance: females are carrier
and males are affected. Only male siblings, males
on maternal side including maternal male cousins,
maternal uncles, and maternal grandfather are
affected. This is typically seen in hemophilia A and B or
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
{{ Autosomal recessive inheritance: both parents of
affected person are heterozygotes and often there is
a history of consanguinity. Siblings of either sex and
both maternal as well as paternal cousins of either sex
are affected (horizontal transmission). This pattern is
typical of disorders of factor II, V, VII, X, XI, XII, and XIII
deficiency
{{ Autosomal dominant inheritance: there is vertical
transmission as the proband is affected, one of the
parents is affected and grandparents may be affected
with variable penetrance and variable severity within
families. This is seen typically in Von Willebrand
disease, some types of qualitative platelet defects,
dysfibrinogenemia, and hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia. Some of the cases may be spontaneous
mutation with negative family history
{{ Although a positive family history is of great value
in the diagnosis of bleeding disorders, a negative
family history does not rule out the possibility of

inherited bleeding disorders. Family history might be
negative, if the coagulation defect is mild or there is a
spontaneous mutation, as is seen in 20% of patients
with hemophilia A
Site of bleeding: superficial bleeding is more common in
platelet type of bleeding and most common platelet disorder
is ITP which is acquired cause of bleeding whereas deep
bleeding especially muscle hematoma or joint hematoma
are typically seen in coagulation factor deficiency like
hemophilia which are inherited causes of bleeding.

•

Acquired Causes
Conversely, patients with acquired disorders usually present
later in life and have a negative family history. They may be
associated with underlying systemic disorders like kidney
diseases and liver disorders, infections, etc. Previous history of
operations like circumcision, dental extraction, tonsillectomy,
or major operation practically rules out the possibility of a
moderate to severe inherited bleeding disorder. Absence of
bleeding from previous trauma, however, does exclude an
inherited bleeding disorder. Patients of mild hemophilia with
factor level around 10–25% may bleed only after severe trauma.
Subject with normal hemostasis may also have bleeding from
nonhematological causes as seen in females with menorrhagia
or of molar tooth extraction. History of ingestion of drugs like
aspirin, in the recent past should lead to the suspicion of a
transient drug related hemostatic defect. Similarly, history of
oral contraceptives or pregnancy may temporarily increase
factor VIII and Von Willebrand factor levels and thus increasing
the hemostatic competency in women with Von Willebrand
disease.

Associated Underlying Disorders
Certain characteristic hemostatic defects are associated with
specific clinical conditions, e.g., liver diseases with factor II,
VII, IX, and X deficiency and fibrinolysis due to decreased
clearance of activators and hypercoagulable state because
of antithrombin III and protein C deficiency. Malabsorption
states may be associated with vitamin K deficiency. Acute
promyelocytic leukemia is known to be associated with DIC due
to increased cellular procoagulant activities. Myeloproliferative
disorder may have platelet defects, thrombocytopenia, and
thrombocythemia. Amyloidosis may be associated with
factor X deficiency and capillary fragility. Systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody (APLA)
syndromes may be associated with thrombocytopenia,
acquired hemophilia or acquired Von Willebrand disease or
on the other hand with hypercoagulable states.

Clinical Pearls
Questions to be asked while history taking in a bleeding child:

•
•
•
•

It the bleeding significant?
Is the bleeding due to local cause or systemic cause?
Is the bleeding platelets/vascular type or coagulation type?
Is the bleeding due to congenital or acquired cause?

Site of Bleeding
Presence of superficial bleeds like petechiae, purpura, and
few superficial ecchymosis suggest ITP, vascular cause, or
platelet dysfunction. Deep bleeding like muscle hematoma,
exsanguinating hematomas, retroperitoneal bleeds, and
joint bleeds are pathognomonic of coagulation disorders like
hemophilia.

Associated Syndromes
There are some specific systemic disorders which have
bleeding as a significant problem and have pathognomonic
tell-tale signs as shown in table 2. This includes presence of
• Skeletal deformities, mental retardation, hypogonadism,
short stature, hyperpigmentation, and renal anomalies in
Fanconi’s anemia
• Absent radius in thrombocytopenia with absent radius
(TAR) syndrome
• Ataxia, mucosal telangiectasia, and mental subnormality
in ataxia telangiectasia
• Partial albinism in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome
• Syndactyly or lobster hand in factor V deficiency
• Keloids in children with afibrinogenemia and factor XIII
deficiency
• Cigarette paper scar, hyperextensible joints, cutis elastic in
Ehlers- Danlos syndrome
• Hematochezia, thrombocytopenia, recurrent infection,
otitis media, and eczema in a male child with WiskottAldrich syndrome
• Giant hemangioma associated with evidence of clinical
and subclinical DIC and thrombocytopenia in KasabachMerritt syndrome.

Clinical Pearls
Questions to be asked while examining a bleeding child:

•
•
•
•

ch-63.indd 289

Is he a well or a sick child?
Is there organomegaly?
Are there other systemic disorder signs?
Are there physical anomalies, especially skeletal deformities?

INVESTIGATIONS
No single test is suitable for the laboratory evaluation or
the overall process of hemostasis and blood coagulation.
Laboratory tests can be conveniently divided into screening
tests and special tests. Screening tests are applied only after
evaluating the nature and clinical circumstances of bleeding
and prior to surgery, so as to know the presence and nature of
bleeding disorder so that special tests can be done to confirm
the diagnosis thus avoiding a battery of unnecessary tests.

Screening Tests
Screening tests include:
• Complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral smear (PS)
examination
• Platelet count
• Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin
time (aPTT)
• Thrombin time
• Bleeding time (BT), clotting time, and clot retraction
(rarely).
Interpretation of the screening tests is always done together
and never in isolation as shown in the table 3.
Complete blood count and PS examination: CBC tells the
involvement of red blood cell series (Hb and red cell indices),
white blood cell series (total leukocytes and absolute
neutrophil count), and platelet series. Peripheral smear
examination will confirm all these three cell series involvement
and give clue to the probable diagnosis like leukemia, etc. For
platelets, PS is more reliable than machine reports. Presence
of 10–15 platelets per high power field and presence of platelet
clumps will suggest normal platelet counts. Large platelets
are seen in regenerative thrombocytopenia as seen in ITP,
normal size platelets are seen as in aregenerative cause of

seen as in Bernard-Soulier syndrome, microplatelets are seen
as in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and presence of normal
platelets but not in clumps will indicate absence of aggregation,
suggesting platelet functional disorder.
Platelet count: it is a simple first step in evaluating the cellular
aspect of hemostasis. However, manual count is not reliable
and not reproducible and hence platelet count should be done
on particle cell counter or using phase contrast microscope.
In platelet type of bleeding, if platelet count is normal or
marginally low, vascular or platelet functional disorders should
be kept in mind.

Prothrombin time, aPTT, and TT: aPTT is an excellent
screening test for determining abnormality of intrinsic clotting
pathway and common pathways and is sensitive to activities
of approximately 20% or less of factor VIII and IX or XI. aPTT
is prolonged during deficiency or abnormalities of extrinsic
pathway clotting factors like high molecular weight, kininogen,
prekallikrein, factor XII, XI, IX, VIII; or of common pathway
clotting factors like X, V, II, and fibrinogen; or by inhibitors
of blood coagulation such as lupus inhibitors, heparin, and
fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product. Activated partial
thromboplastin time of test more than 10 seconds over control
is considered abnormal.
Prothrombin time measures extrinsic clotting system
and the common pathway. It is measured as International
Normalized Ratio (INR) and is considered abnormal when INR
is more than 1.2, however, if INR is not available it is considered
abnormal when test Prothrombin time is more than 3 seconds
over control. PT is prolonged with deficiencies of intrinsic
pathway clotting factor like VII; or common pathway factors
like X, V, II, and fibrinogen and inhibitors of these factors.

Thrombin time measures thrombin induced conversion
of fibrinogen to fibrin and is abnormal in patients with
hypofibrinogenemia whether acquired or congenital or
dysfibrinogenemia and in presence of inhibitors like heparin,
myeloma proteins and fibrin degradation products which
block either thrombin cleavage of fibrinopeptide or fibrin
monomer polymerization.
A prolongation of PT with normal partial thromboplastin
time (PTT) that is corrected by adding normal pooled plasma
indicates factor VII deficiency that occurs with congenital
deficiency, early during oral anticoagulant therapy, vitamin K
deficiency, or liver diseases. This is further confirmed by factor
VII assay.
A prolonged aPTT with normal PT which is corrected
by adding normal pooled plasma will suggest deficiency of
factor VII, IX, XI, or XII, however, factor XII deficiency does
not manifest clinically with bleeding and in fact presents with
thromboembolism hence leaving deficiency of factor VIII,
IX or XI as the cause. This can be confirmed further by doing
factor VIII, factor IX, and factor XI assay in that order based on
their incidence.
Prolongation of both PT and aPTT would suggest common
pathway factor deficiency like factor X, V, II, or fibrinogen;
or multiple factor deficiency of intrinsic as well as extrinsic
pathways as seen in chronic liver disease or vitamin K
deficiency.
Prolonged TT would suggest fibrinogen deficiency or
dysfunction. Prolonged TT with normal serum fibrinogen
would suggest dysfibrinogenemia, and with low or absent
fibrinogen levels would suggest hypo- or afibrinogenemia.
Prolonged aPTT should be screened for presence of
inhibitor doing correction study where 1 mL of test plasma
is mixed with 1 mL of pooled normal plasma and aPTT

is repeated at zero and 4 hours. If aPTT corrects by more
than 50%, it suggests factor deficiency. If aPTT does not
correct and even worsens after 4 hours of incubation, it
suggests of presence of inhibitor which is then confirmed by
doing inhibitor assay. In such cases one must also rule out
autoimmune disorders like APLA syndrome and SLE by doing
appropriate tests.

Others
Bleeding time: this test evaluates primary hemostatic stage
and is ideally done with the help of template. The normal BT is
4–7 minutes and prolongation of BT usually occurs at platelet
count less than 50,000/cumm. At counts below 10,000/cumm,

BT is usually prolonged and is often 15 minutes or longer and
hence BT in severe thrombocytopenia is not required and can
be hazardous as it can lead to scarring.
Qualitative platelet disorders have prolonged BT with
nearly normal platelet count as seen in Glanzmann’s
thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, storage pool
disorder, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and with various drugs
like aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
like ibuprofen, etc. Even in Von Willebrand disease, BT is
usually prolonged as Von Willebrand factor is involved in
binding of platelets to matrix protein or to other cells. One
can do platelet aggregation study to prove platelet functional
disorders as shown in table 4. This can be confirmed by doing

platelet surface receptor studies for gpIIB/IIIA or gpIX which
are now widely available.
Clot retraction: retraction and exudation of the serum after 1
hour is observed in the clotting tube. Normally, 50% exudation
at the end of 1 hour of the original blood volume is taken
as normal retraction. However, with the advent of platelet
aggregation study and platelet receptor study, this test has
become obsolete.
Factor XIII assay: factor XIII deficiency presents with delayed
umbilical cord falling, intracranial bleeds, or delayed bleeding
from wounds with poor healing. Screening tests for bleeding
are normal in such cases; one can do 5 molar urea solubility
test to prove factor XIII deficiency.

Clinical Pearls
Never do bleeding time (BT) and clotting time (CT) as screening
tests.

Always do following tests:
• CBC with platelets counts and a peripheral smear for platelet
morphology
• Prothrombin time (PT)
• Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
• Thrombin time (TT) with S. fibrinogen.

Bleeding Disorders with Normal Screening Tests

292

ch-63.indd 292

Bleeding disorders not associated with any abnormalities in
screening tests are:
• Vascular causes like Henoch-Schonlein purpura, here­
ditary telangiectasia (Pender-Osler-Weber syndrome),
scurvy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, senile purpura, simple
purpura (seen in 10% of women)
• Factor XIII deficiency
• Fibrinolytic pathway defects like a-2 antiplasmin deficiency
• Amyloidosis (may or may not be associated with factor X
deficiency)
• Mild clotting factor deficiency.

MANAGEMENT OF BLEEDING CHILD
Management of a bleeding child will include general
supportive care and specific supportive care and treatment of
primary disease (the list is vast and beyond the scope of this
chapter).
General supportive care: this will include volume expansion
using crystalloids and colloids, inotropes for falling blood
pressure, oxygen to improve tissue oxygenation, and treatment
of primary disease if any.
Specific supportive care: it includes packed red blood cells
to maintain hemoglobin in physiological range, platelets to
arrest bleeding in a case of thrombocytopenia (mainly in cases
due to decreased production), DIC [along with fresh-frozen
plasma (FFP)] and platelet dysfunction; FFP in cases with
coagulopathy; specific factor replacement in a case of known
clotting factor deficiency; use of cryoprecipitate to increase
fibrinogen levels; use of factor eight inhibitor bypassing
activity or activated prothrombin complex concentrates
in hemophilia with inhibitor; plasma exchange in a case of
any inhibitors; and activated factor VII for nonresponsive
bleeding due to any cause.

Clinic Pathological
Approach to Coagulation Disorder
Sangeeta S Mudaliar, Bharat Agarwal

INTRODUCTION
Bleeding in a child can be a diagnostic challenge because of the
wide range of possible causes. Evaluation of a child presenting
with bleeding should include a comprehensive medical and
bleeding history, a complete family history, a detailed physical
examination, and selected laboratory tests. Investigations and
lab tests should be requested based on history and clinical
findings.
This chapter will be focussed on the laboratory tests, their
interpretation, and significance on arriving at a diagnosis of
various bleeding disorders. Bleeding disorders can be inherited
or acquired, and include coagulation factor deficiencies,
platelet deficiencies and/or dysfunctions, and von Willebrand
disease (vWD).
Algorithm 1 represents the differential diagnosis of
various clinical conditions which may present with purpura or
bleeding. The various disease conditions have been grouped as
nice (benign course) or nasty (malignant or life threatening or
prolonged course).
Algorithm 2 gives an approach to causes of mucosal and
superficial skin bleeding while algorithm 3 gives an approach

to conditions which present with large ecchymosis and/or
joint bleeding .
Algorithm 4 explains a comprehensive approach to a
child presenting with bleeding and/or abnormal coagulation
screening test.

SCREENING TESTS
Initial tests to screen for bleeding disorders should include a
complete blood count (CBC) with platelet counts, blood film,
prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin
time (aPTT).
Sample collection: improperly collected sample is the most
common cause of falsely elevated clotting time. Also, samples
collected from indwelling catheters give spuriously abnormal
values due to contamination with heparin or intravenous fluids.
Samples should be collected in tubes containing citrate
(3.2 or 3.8%) as anticoagulant. The ratio of citrate to whole
blood should be 1:9. This needs to be adjusted if patient has
high hematocrit. For infants and children, small 3 mL tubes
(2.7 mL blood to 0.3 mL citrate) should be used.
Samples should be tested within 2 hours of collection if at
room temperature or within 4 hours if kept cold.

Complete Blood Count
Complete blood count [blood collected into ethylene­
diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)] is performed to exclude
thrombocytopenia. Complete blood count also provides
information about additional cytopenias and other white blood
cell (WBC) and red blood cell (RBC) abnormalities. Peripheral
blood film (blood collected into EDTA) provides additional
information regarding platelet number, size, clumping, and
granularity (the platelet count can be estimated by the number
of platelets per ×100 field multiplied by 20 × 109/L).
Pseudothrombocytopenia resulting from clumping of
platelets collected in EDTA anticoagulant can be identified by
examination of the blood film, and confirmed by recollecting
a specimen in citrate anticoagulant in which clumping

will not occur. If true thrombocytopenia is diagnosed, the
next step is to differentiate between new onset acquired
thrombocytopenia, chronic acquired thrombocytopenia, and
congenital thrombocytopenia.
Evaluation of WBC morphology allows identification
of malignant blasts, granulocyte inclusions, such as Dohlelike bodies, or other WBC abnormities. Evaluation of RBC
morphology is important to exclude a microangiopathic
process as evidenced by presence of fragmented RBCs,
microcytosis, macrocytosis, and other RBC abnormalities.

Clinical Pearl
• Improperly collected samples are one of the most common
causes of spurious lab results.

Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio
Prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (INR)
(blood collected into citrate) measures the extrinsic and
common pathway in the coagulation cascade (tissue factor,

ch-64.indd 295

FVII, FX, FV, FII, fibrinogen). Results should be compared with
age-specific laboratory reference intervals, and are reported in
seconds and/or as a percentage of a normal control sample.
The INR is the ratio of a patient’s PT to a normal control
sample, raised to the power of the ISI value for the analytical
system used: INR = (observed PT/control PT) ISI, where ISI =
international sensitivity index (sensitivity of thromboplastin).
A prolonged PT/high INR (with normal aPTT) suggests
FVII deficiency, or use of vitamin K analogs such as warfarin.
The PT is performed by adding a thromboplastin reagent that
contains calcium chloride to the citrated plasma sample of
patient. The time required for clot formation is recorded using
an automated instrument.

Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time
Activated partial thromboplastin time measures the intrinsic
and common pathways of coagulation (FXII, FXI, FIX, FVIII,
FX, FV, FII, fibrinogen). The aPTT is less sensitive than the PT
to deficiencies of the common pathway factors. Results should
be compared with age-specific laboratory reference intervals,
and results are reported in seconds.

296

ch-64.indd 296

An abnormally prolonged aPTT (with normal PT/INR)
suggests FVIII, FIX, FXI, or FXII deficiency. An aPTT within the
reference range does not reliably exclude mild FVIII, FIX, or
FXI deficiency. Therefore, factor assays should be performed if
specific deficiencies are suspected.
Factor XII deficiency causes a prolonged aPTT, but is not
associated with clinical bleeding. A prolonged aPTT can occur
in severe vWD, as a result of the associated FVIII deficiency.
The aPTT is also prolonged in the presence of inhibitors
including heparin. Heparin contamination occurs most often
in specimens drawn from arterial or central venous catheters.
To avoid heparin contamination, an adequate volume of
blood should be removed prior to sampling. Where that is not
possible, heparin neutralization can be performed, usually by
the addition of heparinase to the sample plasma.
Combined prolongation of PT/INR and aPTT can result
from inherited deficiencies of individual factors in the
common pathway: FX, FV, FII, and fibrinogen, or from the rare
inherited deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation
factors. More commonly, combined abnormalities of aPTT
and PT/INR are the result of acquired deficiencies of multiple
coagulation factors. The aPTT is performed by adding a partial
thromboplastin reagent to citrated plasma sample. The sample
is preincubated with a surface activating reagent (like celite,
kaolin, silica, or ellagic acid) to introduce controlled activation
of contact factor (FXI, FXII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular

weight kininogen). This mixture is then incubated for 2–5
minutes before adding calcium chloride and recording the
time to clot formation by automated instrument.
A summary of clinical conditions presenting with
prolonged PT and aPTT are tabulated in table1.

Mixing Study
A mixing study (blood collected into citrate) is done when an
abnormal PT and/or an aPTT is identified. The patient’s plasma
is mixed with normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio, and the screening
tests are repeated. This test differentiates between factor
deficiency (mixing corrects the PT or aPTT) and the presence
of an inhibitor (mixing does not correct the PT or aPTT). The
most common inhibitor that results in noncorrection of the
aPTT with mixing is a lupus anticoagulant. This is often an
incidental finding in children and is not associated with clinical
bleeding. Specialized assays will confirm its presence. Specific
factor inhibitors also interfere with correction of screening
tests by mixing with normal plasma. Confirmation requires
specific inhibitor assays.
Prothrombin time and aPTT reagents used for testing have
variable sensitivities to coagulation factors and insensitive
reagents may result in false negative (i.e., normal) results for
mild deficiencies. If there is a strong suspicion of a coagulation
factor deficiency, specific factor assays should be performed.

Thrombin Time and Fibrinogen Measurement
Thrombin time measures the thrombin-induced conversion
of fibrinogen to fibrin. A prolonged TT suggests a quantitative
or qualitative abnormality of fibrinogen or the presence
of heparin in the sample. A quantitative measurement of
fibrinogen should also be performed.
Prothrombin time, aPTT, and TT do not screen for factor
XIII deficiency.
Thrombin time is the time to clot formation after the
addition of thrombin to citrated blood. The TT is prolonged
by heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, fibrin degradation
products, paraproteins, and fibrinogen deficiency (qualitative
and quantitative). Protamine is added to neutralize the heparin
so that the TT can be interpreted without heparin interference.
This assay has been used to establish the presence of adequate
fibrinogen but is not being used as widely now.

Fibrinogen Degradation Products or D-dimer
Fibrin degradation products are fragments resulting from
the action of plasmin on fibrin or fibrinogen and reflect
high fibrinolysis states [such as disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC)], when their levels are elevated.
D-dimers are formed when cross-linked fibrin is degraded.
They can be measured specifically by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Their level is usually higher in DIC and
in thrombotic conditions, such as deep venous thrombosis
and pulmonary embolism. Their elevation in the absence of
symptoms does not imply the presence of these disorders.

Reptilase Time

Fibrinolysis Inhibitors

Reptilase time measures time to clot formation after the
addition of reptilase, a thrombin-like snake enzyme, to
citrated blood. Unlike the TT, it is not affected by heparin. It
can be useful to determine whether heparin is the cause of the
prolonged TT.

Abnormalities of fibrinolysis inhibitors (blood collected into
citrate), such as α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP) and plasminogen
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), can cause rare bleeding disorders
because of increased fibrinolysis.

Urea Clot Lysis Test
Urea clot lysis test (blood collected into citrate) measures the
solubility of the clot with the addition of urea. The urea clot
solubility test relies on the ability of urea to dissolve unstable
clots, which are formed in the absence of factor XIII. Normal
clots are not dissolved by urea or monochloroacetic acid,
unlike clots in patients with factor XIII deficiency.
An abnormal test suggests severe FXIII deficiency or
hypofibrinogenemia. Clot solubility is increased only at very
low levels of FXIII levels (<3%) and, therefore, does not detect
mild/moderate deficiencies. A quantitative assay of FXIII
should be used to confirm the result of this screening test.

Fibrinogen
Fibrinogen’s normal levels range from 200 to 400 mg/dL.
It is an acute phase reactant and higher levels are seen with

ch-64.indd 297

acute illness and stress. Fibrinogen levels can be measured
immunologically or by a chemical method. The level of function
of fibrinogen or fibrinogen activity can also be measured using
von Clauss kinetic assay.

Genetic Testing
The genetic mutations associated with inherited hemostatic
disorders are gradually being revealed. If available, mutational
analysis aids in accurate diagnosis and helps in genetic
counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

Specific Coagulation Factors
A specific factor assay measures the clotting time of a mixture
of diluted test plasma and a specific factor deficient substrate
plasma that supplies all the factors except the one being
measured.

Euglobulin Clot Lysis Test
It is a screening test for excessive fibrinolysis. It is shortened in
conditions characterized by increased fibrinolysis like systemic
fibrinolysis, PAI-1 deficiency, α2-AP deficiency.

Section 7: Hematology/Oncology

Bleeding Time (Using a Device
Appropriate for Size of Child)
A lancet device is used to make a standardized cut on the
volar surface of the forearm, and the time it takes for bleeding
to stop is measured. The bleeding time assesses the function
of platelets and their interaction with the vascular wall. The
bleeding time test was widely used as a screening test for
primary hemostasis disorders, but is less often used now
because of difficulties in standardization.

Platelet Function Analyzer
Platelet function analyzer, PFA-100 (blood collected into
citrate) is an instrument in which primary, platelet-related
hemostasis is simulated. A small sample of anticoagulated
whole blood (0.8 mL) is aspirated via a narrow-diameter
capillary through a microscopic aperture cut into a membrane
coated with the platelet agonists collagen and epinephrine or
collagen and adenosine 5’-diphosphate. The high shear rate
generated under standardized flow conditions and presence
of chemical stimuli result in platelet adhesion, activation, and
aggregation at the aperture, building a stable platelet plug. The
time required to obtain full occlusion of the aperture is reported
as the closure time. The closure time is prolonged by low levels
of von Willebrand factor (vWF), thrombocytopenia, decreased
hematocrit, and by some platelet function abnormalities
(e.g., severe disorders such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome and
Glanzmann thrombasthenia).
Due to issues of both sensitivity and specificity, use of the
PFA-100 as a routine screening test is still debated. However,
the small blood volume needed for this test compared with
the much larger volume required for platelet function testing
by aggregometry (10 mL or more) is an advantage, especially
for screening very young children for vWD or severe platelet
function disorders.

Testing for Defects in Primary Hemostasis
von Willebrand Factor Antigen and Activity
These tests help in making diagnosis of Von Willebrand disease
by measuring the level of von willebrand antigen and ristocetin
cofactor activity.

Platelet Function Testing

298

ch-64.indd 298

The most common method of assessing platelet function is
light transmission aggregometry, in which the increase in
light transmission through a rapidly stirred sample of citrated
platelet-rich plasma is recorded as platelets aggregate. As
a fresh blood sample is needed for aggregation testing, the
patient may have to be referred to a center with a specialized
laboratory. Specialized testing includes measurement of
granule secretion, dense granule enumeration by whole
mount electron microscopy, flow cytometric assessment of
surface receptors, and evaluation of platelet ultrastructure by
transmission electron microscopy.
Screening platelet function for detecting vWD has a low
negative predictive value and may require repeat testing. One
also may measure von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag)
by immunoassay and vWF activity by measuring the ability of

patient’s vWF to agglutinate normal platelets in the presence of
ristocetin (vWF:RCo) or by its ability to bind collagen (vWF: CB).
Factor VIII:C activity is a functional assay for factor VIII that is
measured by mixing normal plasma with factor VIII-deficient
plasma. Levels of vWF:Ag and vWF:RCo may be elevated during
pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, and liver disease. They may
decrease with hypothyroidism and type O blood.

Platelet Aggregometry
The rapidity and extent of platelet agglutination are graphically
recorded after adding a variety of agonists [ristocetin,
epinephrine, collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and
arachidonic acid].
Platelet aggregation studies remain the most sensitive
method for detecting and distinguishing platelet function
defects. In these tests, platelet aggregation is tested by
measuring changes in optical density as platelets respond to
various agents such as ADP, epinephrine, collagen, arachidonic
acid, and ristocetin. Different disorders will show different
patterns. For example, platelets of patients with Glanzmann
thrombasthenia (dysfunctional or deficient glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa complex in platelets) only aggregate with ristocetin,
whereas platelets of patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome
(absent or decreased glycoprotein Ib complex on platelets)
have no aggregation with ristocetin, reduced aggregation with
collagen, and normal aggregation with ADP, arachidonic acid,
and epinephrine.

Thromboelastography
Thromboelastography provides the whole dynamic process
of hemostasis from clot formation to its dissolution and also
provides information about platelet function.

Algorithmic Approach to
Eosinophilia in Children
ATK Rau, Sangeetha Shenoy

INTRODUCTION
Eosinophilia is probably the second most common hematologic
abnormality in children in the tropics after anemia. The normal
eosinophil count ranges from 0.04 × 109 to 0.4 × 109/L and the
percentage in relation to the total leukocyte count ranges from
1 to 6%.
Eosinophilia is defined as eosinophil count more than 0.4 ×
109/L. The count has a diurnal variation, with the lowest value
in the morning and the highest being at night.
For standardization, the morning value at 8 am is taken as
the baseline eosinophil count.
The count also varies with age (Table 1), exercise, and
environmental stimuli (allergen exposure).
Eosinophilia can further be classified as mild (<1.5 ×
109/L), moderate (1.5–5 × 109/L), and severe (>5 × 109/L). The
peripheral eosinophil count does not correlate with the level of
organ damage. The counts may be normal in conditions where
there is significant recruitment of eosinophils into organs as in
eosinophilic pneumonia. On the other hand, a high eosinophil
count may not have associated organ damage. But an eosinophil
count of more than 1.5 × 109/L is considered the level above
which organ damage is more likely to occur. Eosinophilia can
also be masked because of pyogenic inflammation which
can lower the eosinophil counts, as well as by exogenous
administration of medications like corticosteroids, estrogen,
and epinephrine.
The development and terminal differentiation of
eosinophils are controlled by several cytokines like interleukin

(IL)-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and
IL-5, of which the IL-5 is the one which is primarily responsible
for the production. Hence, diseases like extrinsic asthma
and helminthiasis which stimulate the T-helper 2 mediated
immune response have associated eosinophilia.
After transendothelial migration, eosinophils can invade
target organs, secreting their products into surrounding tissues
causing local inflammation and tissue remodeling. Marked
changes in the microenvironment subsequently leading to
chronic organ damage may be caused by the eosinophil derived
substances. This may lead to fibrosis and/or thrombosis in
some of the patients. Certain organs like heart, lung, skin,
spleen, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and central nervous system
are the ones predominantly affected.

ETIOLOGY
Causes of eosinophilia can be divided into primary and
secondary.
• Primary can further be divided into:
{{ Clonal: there can be neoplastic proliferation as part of
an underlying myeloid malignancy. There is histologic,
cytogenetic, or molecular evidence of underlying
myeloid malignancy
{{ Idiopathic: this is considered once secondary and clonal
eosinophilia is ruled out. It includes hypereosinophilic
syndrome (HES)
• Secondary/reactive:
{{ Helminthiasis
{{ Drugs
{{ Allergic vasculitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, allergic
bronchopulmonary eosinophilia, allergic angiitis,
Churg-Strauss disease
{{ Neoplastic diseases as a paraneoplastic syndrome
{{ Immunologic disorders
{{ Endocrine.

Section 7: Hematology/Oncology
Helminthiasis: worldwide, helminthiasis is the most common
cause of eosinophilia. It can be associated with tissue
nematodes, cestodes, and trematodes. All parasitic infections,
including hookworm, roundworm, tapeworm, filariasis,
trichinella, strongyloides, and visceral larva migrans, have
moderate to marked eosinophilia. Parasites elicit eosinophilia
when they or their products come in contact with immune
effector cells in tissues which happen during migration. Hence,
it is seen in infestation with worms that migrate through
extraintestinal organs. Parasites that are wholly intramural like
adult tapeworm or contained in a cystic structure like hydatid
cyst do not cause eosinophilia unless the cyst wall ruptures
and its contents leak.
Other infections like scabies, fungal diseases like dissemi­
nated coccidioidomycosis, and aspergillosis [when presenting
as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergil­losis (ABPA)] can also
be associated with marked eosinophilia. Tropical pulmonary
eosinophilia is the result of immunologic hyper-responsiveness
to the filarial parasite. It should be considered in a child with
the following—residence in or has had a history of travel to a
filarial endemic area, raised serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
(>1,000 U/L), raised antifilarial antibody titers, eosinophilia
more than 3 × 109/L, absence of microfilaria in blood, and
significant clinical improvement after 3 weeks course of
diethylcarbamazine. There is a dramatic fall in the eosinophil
count after 7–10 days of treatment. The importance of
treatment lies in the fact that untreated tropical pulmonary
eosinophilia can lead to progressive interstitial fibrosis and
chronic bronchitis.
Allergic diseases: in Western countries, allergic diseases are
the leading cause of eosinophilia. Asthma generally is not
associated with moderate or severe eosinophilia. If there
is moderate to severe eosinophilia in asthma, possibility of
Churg-Strauss disease or ABPA has to be considered.
Drug-related eosinophilia: it is a common cause of persistent
eosinophilia in parts of the world where helminthiasis is
uncommon. It can be asymptomatic or associated with some
symptoms as follows:
• Asymptomatic: quinine, penicillin, cephalosporins, and
quinolones
• Associated pulmonary infiltrates: nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, sulfa drugs, and nitrofurantoin
• Hepatitis: tetracyclines, antipsychotics
• DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic
Symptoms)
syndrome:
sulfasalazine,
hydantoin,
carbamazepine, and D-penicillamine.
Neoplastic diseases: lymphoid malignancy (Hodgkin’s
lymphoma), B or T cell leukemia or lymphoma, Langerhans cell
histiocytosis, solid tumors, and mastocytosis are associated with
eosinophilia. It could be a paraneoplastic feature of solid tumors
like adenocarcinoma of lung, cervix, and GIT because of ectopic
production of IL-5 and other cytokines by malignant cells.
Immunologic disorders like Omenn syndrome, hyper-IgE
syndrome, graft-versus host disease.

300

ch-65.indd 300

Endocrine: eosinophilia is seen in conditions with hypo­
adrenalism because of loss of endogenous glucocorti­costeroids
as in Addison’s disease, adrenal hemorrhage, hypopituitarism.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome: it is characterized by persistent
eosinophilia more than 1.5 × 109/L for more than 6 months,
evidence of end organ damage but no explanation after
investigations. It has two variants: myeloproliferative variant
hypereosinophilic syndrome (M-HES) and lympho­cytic variant
hypereosinophilic syndrome (L-HES). Myelo­
proliferativeHES is associated with other features of myeloproliferative
diseases like increased serum vitamin B12 levels, hepato­
splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased
bone marrow cellularity. Lymphocytic-HES is associated with
cutaneous manifestations, increased serum IgE levels and
hypergammaglobulinemia. There is overproduction of IL-5 by
deregulated T cells leading to polyclonal eosinophil expansion.
Clonal eosinophilia: there are two subcategories in
World Health Organization classification of hematologic
malignancies: chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise
specified and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia
and mutations involving platelet-derived growth factor
receptor, and -b or fibroblast growth factor receptor. It might
also be seen in other myeloid malignancies like myelodysplastic
syndromes and systemic mastocytosis.

Clinical Pearls
• An eosinophil count of more than 0.4 × 109/L is considered as
eosinophilia and is further classified into mild (<1.5 × 109/L),
moderate (1.5–5 × 109/L) and severe (>5 × 109/L) eosinophilia.
A count of more than 1.5 X 109/L is generally associated with
organ damage
• Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia should be considered in a
child residing in or with a history of travel to a filarial endemic
area with a raised serum immunoglobulin E (>1,000 U/L),
raised antifilarial antibody titers, eosinophilia more than 3 ×
109/L, absence of microfilaria in blood and significant clinical
improvement after 3 weeks course of diethylcarbamazine
• Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is defined by persistent
eosinophilia more than 1.5 × 109/L for more than 6 months,
evidence of end organ damage but no explanation after
investigations. The two variants of HES are myeloproliferative
variant HES (M-HES) and lymphocytic variant HES (L-HES).

Approach to a Child with
Respiratory Distress
Soumya Tiwari

INTRODUCTION

DEFINITION

Respiratory distress is the most common presentation in
children visiting a hospital emergency. It initially, may manifest
only as fast breathing (rate more than the normal upper limit
for that age group; see Table 1), and signs of increased work
of breathing in the form of nasal flaring and/or lower chest
indrawing, and/or head nodding can follow. It may also be
associated with stridor or wheeze suggestive of upper and
lower airway obstruction, respectively. There is a need of
urgent assessment of airway patency and breathing, when a
child with respiratory distress is first evaluated. Stabilization
of vital parameters may require proper positioning, oronasal
suctioning, and intubation if the airway patency cannot
be maintained and use of oxygen by hood/nasal prongs.
Supportive therapy in the form of maintaining temperature
or correction of hyperthermia/hypothermia; intravenous
fluid boluses; correction of hypoglycemia; nebulization with
bronchodilator; intercostal tube drainage of any air or fluid
collection in the pleural cavity, etc. Such initial treatment
coupled with a thorough history, physical examination and
relevant investigations, is followed by establishing a provisional
diagnosis and instituting appropriate empirical treatment in
the emergency ward itself. Uncommonly, a serious terminally
sick child may show bradypnea (decreased heart rate) instead
of tachypnea.

Any unusual pattern of breathing, causing a subjective feeling
of discomfort, in a previously well child is termed as respiratory
distress. It includes abnormally fast or slow breathing, shallow
or labored efforts, or noisy breathing.

ETIOLOGY OF RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
Respiratory distress may not always result from a lung disease.
Rapid breathing may be physiological, e.g., exercise induced, or
pathological due to pulmonary or nonpulmonary causes. The
respiratory rate cut offs given in Table 1 are seen in pathological
conditions and these could be seen in many different clinical
situations as detailed in Box 1.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Clinical Pearls

A child with respiratory distress may have tachypnea with
increased work of breathing (suggested by use of accessory
muscles), cyanosis and lethargy or altered sensorium.
Alteration in sensorium (in the form of irritability, agitation,
lethargy, or coma) indicates brain hypoxia and is one of the
earliest indicators of impending respiratory failure. While fast
breathing is commonly associated with respiratory diseases,
it may also occur with fever, crying, or metabolic acidosis.
However, normal or decreased respiratory rate may be more
ominous if it is associated with severe retractions (paradoxical
breathing), cyanosis, grunting, or altered sensorium. Central
cyanosis is a late sign but may not be detected in presence of
severe pallor (low hemoglobin) and dark skin color.
Stridor is a harsh inspiratory sound that indicates upper
airway obstruction. Grunt is a loud noise produced by a
forceful expiration against a closed glottis. Grunt and wheeze
(a musical sound) are suggestive of lower airway obstruction.
A complete history including the onset, duration,
progression of dyspnea, the aggravating and relieving factors as
well as the associated symptoms, like fever, cough, sore throat,
chest pain, choking episodes, accidental ingestion of poisons,
etc. can help in short listing the likely cause (Table 2).

INVESTIGATIONS
Laboratory investigations help to confirm the diagnosis but
the immediate management of a patient should not be delayed
pending the reports of the investigations. Use of noninvasive
devices, such as pulse oximeter and end-tidal carbon dioxide
detector lessen the need for repeated invasive tests for monitoring
of the child. Table 3 shows the relevant investigations to ascertain
the cause of respiratory distress in a child.

TREATMENT
The management of a child with respiratory distress includes
supportive treatment in the form of stabilization of vital
parameters, i.e., airway, breathing, and circulation followed
by definitive treatment by instituting appropriate respiratory
support, antibiotics, chest tube drainage, decongestive
measures, etc. The algorithmic approach to management of
such a child is shown in algorithm 1.

SUGGESTED READINGS

It is essential to promptly triage children with impending
respiratory failure and quickly institute supportive
management, simultaneously searching for the etiology
and planning a definitive treatment. The above mentioned
approach will improve the outcome of children, especially the

Assessing and
Managing a Child with Stridor
Dhulika Dhingra, Varinder Singh

INTRODUCTION
Stridor is a harsh, high-pitched vibratory sound caused
by partial obstruction of respiratory passages that result
in turbulent passage of air through the airways. It can
be almost always heard without stethoscope though not
uncommonly it may be audible directly to the ear. Stridor
is usually heard during inspiration, but sometimes may
be biphasic. Inspiratory stridor may result if the child
breathes against a closed glottis, expiratory stridor results
due to semiapproximated vocal cords causing resistance to
exhalation and biphasic stridor may result due to subglottic or
glottic anomaly or a severe obstruction of the extra-thoracic
airway. Loudness of the sound is poor marker of the degree of
obstruction, while its presence even when the patient is quiet
or biphasic stridor is associated with significant compromise.
Stridor must be differentiated from stertor, which is produced
by an obstruction in the nose or nasopharynx.
Stridor is the sound caused by abnormal air passage
during breathing. The cause of stridor can usually be located
somewhere in extra-thoracic airway (pharynx, larynx, and
trachea). Stridor may be acute (caused by inflammation/
infection or foreign body inhalation) or chronic. It may be
congenital or acquired. Stridor is a sign and not a diagnosis
and the cause for which must be ascertained. This chapter aims
to educate the pediatrician faced with a child or infant with
stridor to determine the severity or respiratory compromise
and the need for immediate intervention, to decide based
upon history and clinical examination whether a significant
lesion is suspected and to understand the consequences and
management strategies of the underlying lesion for follow-up
and subsequent management of the child.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Gases produce pressure equally in all directions; however,
when a gas moves in a linear direction, it produces pressure in

ch-67.indd 308

the forward vector and decreases the lateral pressure. When air
passes through a narrowed flexible airway in a child, the lateral
pressure that holds the airway open can drop precipitously
(venturi principle) and cause the tube to collapse. A similar
process obstructs airflow and produces stridor in cases with
upper-airway obstruction.
The most common causes of stridor are summarized in
Table 1.

HISTORY AND CLINICAL EXAMINATION
A good history and the clinical examination are the key to
localization of the cause of stridor. A child presenting with
stridor should be inquired about the onset of stridor (onset
in first few months of life usually indicate a congenital cause),
postural variation, feeding difficulties, any change in voice
quality, pattern of fever, history of foreign body inhalation in
form of sudden choking, any neurological symptoms, history
of trauma to head and neck (to look for neurogenic stridor),

INVESTIGATIONS
Establishing a patent airway is of utmost importance. No
laboratory investigation or imaging should take precedence
over establishing airway. If the patient has chronic stridor, has
no or minimal respiratory distress, he/she may be taken up for
flexible laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy to look for underlying
abnormalities. The procedure may also rule out secondary
airway lesions.
If the child has an acute stridor in the absence of severe
respiratory distress, one may go for a chest X-ray or soft-tissue
lateral neck imaging depending upon the history. A clinician
capable of establishing airway should accompany such a
patient to the X-ray department.

Clinical Pearl
immunization history, and history of similar illness in the
neighborhood (diphtheria). It is, however, emphasized that
parents may not have noticed the choking episode hence, a
high index of suspicion is warranted if stridor has appeared all
of a sudden without any other attendant symptoms, like fever,
coryza, etc.
Detailed clinical examination may also help in identifying
the cause. Onset of stridor, presence/absence of fever, voice
change and ability of patient to handle secretions will aid in
determining the site. A positional change in severity of stridor
may indicate laryngomalacia. A child with choanal atresia
may have increased distress as he closes his mouth and with
crying his distress may be relieved. Voice quality should also
be observed during the examination; however, it must be
remembered that a normal voice quality does not rule out
laryngeal or pharyngeal pathology though presence of changes
in voice quality does. Table 2 summarizes important voice
changes associated with different pathologies.
Clinical examination must also include a detailed
neurological examination and inspection of the spine to rule
out neurogenic stridor. Neck should be examined for any
lymph node masses or for any evidence of trauma. Note should
also be made of craniofacial anomalies including macrglossia,
retrognathia and maxillary hypoplasia. Throat examination
may reveal presence of a membrane, tonsillar enlargement,
or presence of exudates. Throat examination should not be
attempted for a child who is drooling, has high grade fever, and
is agitated.
Apart from ascertaining the diagnosis, clinical examination
should also aim at assessing the severity of respiratory distress.
Retractions/use of accessory muscles are better clinical signs
than degree of stridor when assessing degree of respiratory
distress. Cyanosis is a late finding and is a sign of impending
respiratory failure.

Clinical Pearl
• Onset of stridor, presence/absence of fever, voice change, and
ability of patient to handle secretions will aid in determining
the diagnosis.

ch-67.indd 309

• Establishing a patent airway must take precedence over
imaging and bronchoscopy in evaluating patients with stridor.

Chest X-ray in a child with history of foreign body
inhalation may reveal unilateral hyperinflation or collapse,
while radiograph of a child with laryngotracheobronchitis
shows subglottic narrowing (steeple sign).

MANAGEMENT
Laryngotracheobronchitis/Croup
Croup is a heterogeneous group of acute and infectious
processes in children (between 6 months to 6 years of age)
that manifest most commonly with characteristic inspiratory
stridor, barking cough, hoarse voice, and varying degrees of
respiratory distress. Parainfluenza viruses type 1 (50%), 2 and
3; respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, and rhinovirus
account for the majority of cases. The illness usually starts with
a common cold, like illness with symptoms of rhinorrhea,
cough, sore throat, and fever. Features of upper airway
obstruction, i.e., inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and barking
cough develop over next 2–3 days.
Treatment is dependent upon the severity of croup and
includes humidified oxygen, oral or parental steroids, and
inhaled adrenaline.
• Humidified air: It has been widely advocated in the past
without any scientific validation, but it still can be used as
home remedy in children with mild croup.
• Oxygen therapy: Oxygen is the most important treatment for
a child with moderate or severe croup who has considerable
upper-airway obstruction or SpO2 less than 92%.
• Oral or inhaled steroids: Steroids can improve the
symptoms of croup within 6–8 hours after starting the
treatment. They also result in shorter duration of hospital
stay, lesser need of endotracheal intubation, and decreased
need for adrenaline nebulization. Oral corticosteroids
are preferred as they are inexpensive, easy to administer,
readily available, as effective and produce measurable
improvements within hours. The recommended dose of

309

•

•

dexamethasone is 0.15–0.3 mg/kg body weight (oral or IM)
and prednisolone (suspension or tablets) is 1 mg/kg body
weight. Nebulized budesonide (2 mg) has been shown to
be equally efficacious. This can be repeated 12 hourly for
up to 48 hours. The choice of route is based upon the cost
and the child condition.
Nebulized adrenaline: It is indicated in children with
moderate to severe croup with stridor at rest and marked
intercostal or subcostal indrawing. One needs to administer
1:1000 dilution solution of nebulized adrenaline 0.5 mL/kg
of body weight (maximum of 5 mL). It has a rapid onset
of action on bronchial and tracheal epithelial vascular
permeability, thereby decreasing airway edema, which,
in turn, increases the airway radius and improves airflow,
with improvement in croup severity score within 30
minutes. However, it has a temporary action on the airway
obstruction and only gives time for the underlying basic
pathology to resolve and may delay or decrease the need
for intubation/tracheostomy. If the severity recurs, the
dose can be repeated after 2–4 hours.
Antimicrobials: These have no role in treatment of viral
croup, even to prevent secondary bacterial infection.
Airway management: A severely obstructed airway leading
to signs of impending respiratory failure will need either
endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Intubation
with a size smaller than the most appropriate size based
on the age of the child is preferred as there is significant
edema of the airway. Tracheostomy can often be avoided
if an experienced pediatrician/anesthetist is available for a
rapid-sequence intubation.
Discharge: Child can be sent home when there is no
stridor at rest. Parents need to be educated for monitoring
worsening of symptoms.

Epiglottitis
Epiglottitis is a medical emergency occurring most commonly
in children aged 2–7 years, due to fulminant inflammation of
the supraglottic structures: epiglottis, arytenoids, aryepiglottic
folds, and uvula, due to infection by Haemophilus influenzae
type B. It is not often reported from India. Clinically, the
child appears toxic. The disease is characterized by an abrupt
onset of high-grade fever, sore throat, dysphagia, respiratory
distress, and drooling of saliva. Establishing an airway by
nasotracheal intubation or less often, by tracheostomy is
indicated. In general, children with acute epiglottitis are
intubated for 2–3 days, because the response to antibiotics is
usually rapid.

Diphtheria
Diphtheria is commonly seen in partially or completely
unimmunized children. Throat examination reveals a thick
pharyngeal membrane spreading to the adjacent larynx. This
results in airway obstruction. It is important not to agitate the
child as this may precipitate aspiration or airway obstruction.

Child may be administered oxygen. Emergency intubation is to
be avoided and early tracheostomy to establish a patent airway
should be done. Diphtheria antitoxin [80,000–1,20,000 IU,
intravenous (IV)] should be administered and child should be
treated with crystalline penicillin (40,000 U/kg/dose 6 hourly
for 14 days).

Retropharyngeal Abscess
Retropharyngeal abscess is a complication of bacterial
pharyngitis observed in children younger than 6 years. The
child presents with abrupt onset of high fever, difficulty in
swallowing, refusal to feed, sore throat, hyperextension of
the neck, stridor and respiratory distress. Most often they are
polymicrobial; usual pathogens include group A streptococci,
oropharyngeal anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus
aureus. Treatment options include IV antibiotics, like coamoxyclavulinic acid with or without surgical drainage.
Endotracheal intubation is indicated in any child with stridor
at presentation.

Allergic Reactions/Angioneurotic Edema
Allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) occurs within 30 minutes of
an adverse exposure. Hoarseness and inspiratory stridor may
be accompanied by allergic symptoms (e.g., dysphagia, nasal
congestion, itching eyes, sneezing, and wheezing). Oxygen
should be administered and endotracheal intubation is
indicated in any child with stridor at presentation. Adrenaline
(0.01 mL/kg subcutaneous), hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg), and
antihistaminics are administered.

Laryngomalacia
It is the most common congenital laryngeal anomaly and
the most common cause of stridor in infants and children.
Expectant observation is suitable for most infants because
symptoms resolve spontaneously as the child and airways
grow. If significant obstruction or failure-to-thrive is present,
surgical correction (supraglottoplasty) may be considered
which may be warranted in only 10% cases. It is usually a clinical
diagnosis however, cases presenting early (under 4 weeks of
age) or with severe obstruction should preferably have an early
airway examination to rule-out alternative causes, requiring a
different treatment approach.

Subglottic Stenosis
It can be congenital or acquired. Congenital subglottic stenosis
occurs due to incomplete canalization of the subglottis and cricoid
rings leading to narrowing of the subglottic lumen. Acquired
stenosis is most commonly caused by prolonged intubation
or due to a neglected foreign body. The symptomatology will
depend on degree of stenosis. Symptomatic children may be
tracheotomized. Definitive surgical management includes
endoscopic methods, laser coagulation, or laryngotracheal
reconstruction.

Algorithm for approach to a child with stridor

Vocal Cord Paralysis
Vocal cord paralysis can be congenital or secondary to trauma
at birth or during cardiac or intrathoracic surgery. The left
vocal cord is more commonly affected as the left recurrent
laryngeal nerve may get damaged, secondary to ligation of
patent ductus arteriosus. Since vocal cord paralysis usually
resolves in 6–18 months in infants, those with bilateral vocal
cord paralysis can be managed either by lateralization of the
cords or by tracheostomy. In case of nonresolution in follow
up, definitive surgical management, such as partial cordotomy
and arytenoidopexy may be required.

Conclusion
Stridor is a sign and not a diagnosis. Any child presenting
with stridor should be evaluated to determine the cause
(Algorithm 1). Onset of stridor, presence/absence of fever,
voice change and ability of patient to handle secretions will aid
in determining the diagnosis. Establishing a patent airway is of
utmost priority in such children.

Recurrent Wheezing in
Infants and Preschool Children
Ankit Parakh, Varinder Singh

INTRODUCTION
Recurrent wheezing in children less than five years of age is
a common childhood respiratory problem and possibly the
most common indication for referral to pediatric respiratory
physicians. Asthma in school-age child is due to cellular
airway inflammation and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are
pivotal to management in school-age children with asthma.
However, much less is known about pathophysiology of preschool wheeze and its management has been extrapolated
from studies on older children. The present chapter deals with
the phenotypes, causes, investigations, and management
under-five childhood wheezing with a focus on practical
aspects.

PHENOTYPES OF PRESCHOOL WHEEZE
The conventional teaching was to classify children into
wheeze associated lower respiratory tract infection and early
onset asthma. This distinction was based on whether there
were afebrile episodes, personal/family history of atopy and
response to bronchodilators. Although this distinction could
be useful in clinical practice; a significant overlap between
phenotypes made it less useful. These terms, however, are still
commonly used in clinical practice.
The largest epidemiological data comes from the work of
Fernado Martinez and colleagues from the Tucson children’s
cohort with a follow up into adulthood. Children were classified
as transient early wheezers, late onset wheezers and persistent
wheezers. Although this has been extremely important in
understanding of childhood wheezing, the classification
system is retrospectively based on the follow-up of the child.
What a clinician needs and the parents want is to know whether
the index case shall develop asthma early in disease. They need
a prognostication as soon as possible and not a retrospective
epidemiological tool. An Asthma Predictive Index (API) has
been suggested based on the association between certain risk

ch-68.indd 312

factors with certain types of early child wheezing. The API has
a moderate positive predictive value and a very high negative
predictive value. Hence, an early childhood wheezer with a
negative API has very low chance of developing asthma later
in life.
European Respiratory Society task force recommended
classifying these children in a more pragmatic clinically
relevant syndrome based on their temporal pattern, named
as episodic viral wheeze (EVW) and multiple-trigger wheeze
(MTW) (Table 1). The task force agreed not to use term
asthma to describe preschool wheezing illness since there
was insufficient evidence showing that pathophysiology
of preschool wheezing is similar to childhood asthma.
Inflammation has been poorly studied in preschool children
and might be absent in very young children who wheeze.
However, easy as it seems, yet these divisions do not remain
as distinct compartmental entities and there is a shift of
phenotypes in many cases. The temporal pattern of wheeze
during preschool years (EVW or MTW) is a relatively poor
predictor of long-term outcome (transient versus persistent
wheeze). Frequency and severity of wheezing episodes are
stronger predictors of long-term outcome and should be
taken into consideration when deciding treatment. As a
result of which GINA guidelines 2015 suggests a probability
based approach to assess which under-five children with viral
induced wheezing are more likely to have asthma and hence
are more likely to respond to controller therapy.

Causes
The forgoing discussion of the under-five wheezers is
not for an atypical wheezer. Unlike a typical wheezer, the
atypical wheezer is always marking an underlying disorder.
A detailed description of various form of atypical wheezing
is out of scope of the present chapter but the common
differential diagnosis, clinical pointers, and investigations are
summarized in table 2.

Clinical Pearls
• Preschool wheeze is a very common disorder and usually does
not need to be investigated
• Clinicians should try and clinically differentiate these typical
wheezers form children having atypical wheezing
• Red flag signs need to be identified
• Children with atypical wheezing would need a pediatric
pulmonology referral and will have to be investigated further
• Further investigation can be decided on a case-to-case basis
and might need (one or multiple) sweat chloride, studies
for gastroesophageal reflux disease, flexible bronchoscopy,
immune studies and computed tomography chest.

HISTORY AND EXAMINATION
A detailed history should be obtained including the age of
onset of the first episode, frequency of episodes, severity of
episodes [requiring out-patient department, and emergency
visits, admissions, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions],
association with viral upper respiratory infection (URI), and
nature of drugs used including response should be sought.
Seasonal variation and severity trend should also be seen.
It would be extremely important to elicit details regarding
symptoms during interval period (any cough, wheezing, etc.),
symptoms with activity, and any aeroallergen sensitization.
History of feeding difficulty, choking, and regurgitation of feeds
should be asked. History for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis
should be elicited. A detailed family history including grand
parents would also be useful. All details of the previous
medicines taken should be recorded.
Examination should focus particularly on the growth
velocity of the baby, since children who have failure to thrive
could have an underlying serious illness, like cystic fibrosis
(CF). Presence of clubbing indicates an underlying suppurative
lung disease and should be carefully seen.
Adenoid facies, Dennie-Morgan Folds, transverse
nasal creases, nasal examination (nasal mucosa, turbinate,
deviated nasal septum) are also important features on
physical examination. Respiratory examination should focus
on shape of chest (any increased anteroposterior diameter),
symmetry, and type of wheeze (monophonic or polyphonic).
Presence of monophonic wheeze would indicate a lesion/
compression of the intrathoracic airway and if persistent,
should be investigated further, e.g., endoscopic evaluation. The
examination should also cover the cardiovascular, abdominal,
and nervous systems.

Children who are asymptomatic during intervals and have
a normal examination (normal respiratory rate, no noisy
breathing, no wheeze) are unlikely to have any atypical cause
of wheeze.
The role of investigations to differentiate the phenotype
of preschool wheeze and predict whether this child might
go on to develop asthma or remit is still a matter of research.
Preschool pulmonary function testing techniques (impulse
oscillometry/interrupter technique), fractional exhaled nitric
oxide and biomarkers on exhaled breath condensate have
been used. Since there is no final conclusion on any of these
modalities their routine use in clinical practice needs to wait.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been
evaluated as a cause of wheezing in children but still many
questions remain unanswered. Gastroesophageal reflux
disease is physiological and whether the “D: the disease” can
be attributed to reflux or is just a cotraveler, needs to be defined
for each case. Children with severe episodes, especially less
than 6 months are more likely to have GERD as the sole or one
of the reasons of persistent or recurrent wheezing.
Investigations are required only in children suspected to
have atypical causes of wheezing. The red flag signs in Box 1
should prompt referral for a detailed evaluation. Focused
investigations would be required and might include GER
scan/24 h pH study, flexible bronchoscopy, sweat chloride test,
and computed tomography chest.

TREATMENT
Acute Episode
Inhaled short-acting β2-agonists remain the cornerstone of
therapy although nebulized and oral route are also acceptable
although inferior options. Inhaled or nebulized ipratropium
may be added in severe wheezy episodes. Systemic steroids
short course (either patient initiated or doctor initiated) have
not shown to reduce the symptom scores, hospital admission
rate or duration of hospital stay. It might be considered for a
very severe episode as a counsel of despair but its routine use
is not recommended. Routine use of nebulized steroids has
shown to be ineffective and is not recommended.
Recent studies have evaluated the role of pre-emptive
therapy, i.e., treatment started at the beginning of a URI to
prevent a wheezy episode. Both inhaled fluticasone and
oral montelukast have been shown to have an only modest
effect on reduction in number of wheezing episodes and the
number needed to treat is high. Hence, their routine use is
not justified and might be reserved for children with severe
EVW episodes.

INVESTIGATIONS: HOW AND HOW FAR?

314

ch-68.indd 314

Most children with recurring wheezing (EVW or MTW) do not
require any investigations. A detailed history and complete
physical examination usually is sufficient. As a rule, wheeze
should be documented as clinical mimickers, like recurrent or
back to back URI (nursery school syndrome) and protracted
bacterial bronchitis do not have a wheeze but have ruttles.

Chapter 68: Recurrent Wheezing in Infants and Preschool Children

Regular Prophylaxis
The key issues while considering long-term treatments are:
• Can we identify a child who is more prone to be an
asthmatic in the future?
• Can we modify the natural history of the disease with any
intervention?
• Can we modify lung function levels in adult life?
Three landmark trials (Peak, Ifwin, and PAC) over the last
10 years have shown that ICS only improves symptoms with
no long-term benefit in the form of modification of the natural
course of disease or alteration in lung function. Interested
readers could refer to these very important studies mentioned
under Suggested Readings.

What Does all this Mean in and What are the
Implications for Clinical Practice?
Preschool children with recurrent wheeze, selected based on the
API do respond to ICSs as a group although the effect size is less
as compared to older children with asthma. There are no studies
on non-atopic MTW, but recent data showed that the pathology
of non-atopic and atopic MTW can be similar. Recent metaanalysis suggests no difference in response between atopic
versus nonatopic, although this awaits further studies.
The NHLBI-EPR 3 Guidelines has recommended using
prophylaxis in the following subset of children with recurrent
wheezing less than 5 years of age:
1. Greater than 4 episodes of wheezing in past 1 year lasted
more than 1 day and affected sleep and who have risk
factors for developing persistent asthma: positive API

2. Consistently require symptomatic treatment more than 2
days per week for a period of more than 4 weeks
3. Second asthma exacerbation requiring systemic cortico­
steroids within 6 months.
Although, these guidelines are also based on expert
opinion but appears to be useful.
There is no clear consensus on the type of ICS, dose at
which ICS to be started, maximum dose and when to label
therapy as ineffective. Also there are no studies on the addition
of leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to ICS. Since longacting b-agonist are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved for more than 6 years of age due to concerns on
safety, there are no studies on the use of LABA in preschool
children with wheezing in addition to ICS.
Given the significant shift between the phenotypes,
ICS/LTRA may be considered on a trial basis in preschool
child with recurrent wheeze (MTW or EVW with severe and
recurrent episodes), but should be discontinued if there is no
clear clinical benefit. Children treated with a low-dose ICS
have an average of 5% fewer days with symptoms (or 18 days
per year) than children receiving placebo. Hence, it is arguable
whether this increase in symptom-free days is clinically
significant. The increase cost of therapy, negative impact on
height and other unrecognizable adverse effects should also
be considered. Hence, the use of preventer regimen should be
reserved for only those with very troublesome symptoms and
needing repeated oral steroids. The management algorithm is
discussed in Algorithm 1.

Treatment of children with recurrent wheezing in <5 years still

Ankit Parakh, Shalu Gupta, Varinder Singh

INTRODUCTION
Acute severe asthma or acute exacerbations are acute
episodes of progressive deteriorating shortness of breath,
cough, wheezing, chest tightness, or a combination of these
symptoms. These acute episodes of asthma are an important
cause of morbidity, school absenteeism, and frequent hospital
admissions in children. The severity of these episodes varies
from mild to severe and each episode has the potential to
progress to respiratory failure. The term “critical asthma
syndrome” is now used to describe any child who is at high risk
of fatal asthma and includes acute severe asthma, refractory
asthma, status asthmaticus, and near fatal asthma. Status
asthmaticus refers to an acute asthma exacerbation in which
bronchial obstruction is severe and continues to worsen or not
improve despite the institution of adequate standard therapy,
leading to respiratory fatigue and finally to respiratory failure.
A step-wise approach is required for the early recognition,
coordinated evaluation, and prompt treatment by an
experienced healthcare provider team.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
In USA more than 3.5 million children have greater than or
equal to 1 exacerbation/year, resulting in approximate 1.75
million total emergency department (ED) visits, including 0.64
million for children aged 0–17 years. Children younger than 4
years old age have the highest rate of hospitalizations. Children
aged 5–17 years missed 10.5 million school days owing to
asthma, and activity limitations were reported in 5.5% as well.
In the Indian subcontinent as per the phase 3 ISAAC study,
in children aged 13–14 and 6–7 years, the prevalence of asthma
increased per year by +0.02 and +0.06%, respectively. Although
there is little change in the overall prevalence of the current
wheeze, the percentage of children reported to have had
asthma increased significantly, possibly reflecting a greater
awareness of this condition and/or changes in diagnostic
practice. No country wide or large series data exist regarding
burden of disease due to acute exacerbations.

CLINICAL FEATURES
A rapid initial assessment is a must to determine degree of
airway obstruction and hypoxia. Immediately identify severe
or life-threatening attack in children and institute immediate
measures to treat it (Box 1).
A detailed and rapid clinical assessment is done on the basis
of history, physical examination, and relevant investigations. A
clinical history should include episodes/duration of respiratory
distress, fever, cough, noisy breathing, abnormal respiratory
sounds, episodes of lethargy and cyanosis, records of past
treatment and current treatment, any previous hospitalization
or intensive care unit admission, use of steroids, and exposure
to any allergen or trigger which could have triggered this
attack. A child with asthma will present with bouts of cough,
wheezing, dyspnea, and increases work of breathing. Because
early recognition is important for improving outcomes, various
risk factors are defined for early identification of fatal asthma
(Box 2).
Detailed clinical examination should include level of
consciousness and degree of agitation, respiratory rate,
heart rate, temperature, peripheral pulses, blood pressure,
pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles including chest
retractions and nasal flaring, chest auscultation (wheeze), and
oxygen saturation. Categorization of the acute attack can be
done into mild, moderate, or severe (Table 1).
Chest radiography is not routinely indicated in a child with
previous history of asthma. Indications for chest radiography
may include clinical suspicion for pneumothorax, atelectasis,
foreign body aspiration, after endotracheal intubation or
failure to respond to standard therapy.

Previous near fatal asthma

• “Brittle” asthma (sudden onset of acute severe asthma attacks)
• Poor adherence to medication
• Psychosocial and/or family problems

• Clinical signs correlate poorly with the severity of airways
obstruction. Some children may have very severe airways
obstruction without appearing to be obviously distressed
• In a tachypneic and hyperventilating child, a normal PaCO2
value should be interpreted as a sign of early muscle fatigue
• The decision to intubate a child with severe acute asthma
should be based on the child’s clinical status and not simply
the arterial blood gas values.

TREATMENT

Arterial blood gas measurement provides objective
assessment of gas exchange. Early in the course of asthma,
hypoxemia and hypocapnia are found due to ventilation/
perfusion mismatch and hyperventilation. With the progression
of airﬂow obstruction, PaCO2 measurement returns to normal
values, though in a tachypneic and hyperventilating child, a
normal PaCO2 value should be interpreted as a sign of early
muscle fatigue. With further progression of the disease mixed
respiratory and metabolic acidosis occurs. Lactic acidosis
indicates a combination of excess production from respiratory
muscles, tissue hypoxia (due to hypoxemia and decreased
cardiac output), and dehydration (due to decreased intake
and increased insensible losses). The decision to intubate a
child with severe acute asthma should be based on the child’s
clinical status and not simply the arterial blood gas values.

There is good evidence supporting recommendations for the
initial treatment of acute asthma. Most children would respond
to these measures although a small proportion of children
would need further therapy. There is less evidence to guide the
use of second line therapies to treat the small number of severe
cases poorly responsive to first line measures.
The details regarding assessment, first line treatment,
second line treatment, algorithm, further evaluation and drug
doses should be present in all emergency and pediatric inten­
sive care unit as a ready to use tool. A suggested algorithm is
shown in Algorithm 1 and drugs with doses, delivery methods,
and adverse effects are summarized in Table 2. After each step in
the algorithm the child should be reclassified. Children moving
down a category (e.g., severe to moderate) suggest a good
response; remaining in the same category (e.g., severe to severe)
suggests a partial response; and children moving up a category
(e.g., severe to life threatening) suggest a poor response.

First Line Treatment
Oxygen
All children with severe and life-threatening asthma or SpO2
less than 92%, should receive supplemental oxygen via a
face mask or nasal cannula at sufficient flow rates to achieve
normal saturations. Partial rebreathing and non-rebreathing
masks are useful in providing high concentration of fraction of
inspired oxygen in children not maintaining on simple/venturi
face mask.

Short-acting β-2 Agonists
Short-acting b-2 agonists (salbutamol, levosalbutamol,
terbutaline) are the bronchodilators of choice for acute

ch-69.indd 319

exacerbations of asthma across all severity. Children with
severe or life-threatening asthma should receive frequent doses
of nebulized bronchodilators (2.5–5 mg salbutamol) driven by
oxygen, repeated every 20–30 minutes; although metered-dose
inhaler with spacers can be used (10–12 puffs of salbutamol
100 µg repeated every 2–4 minutes titrated according to clinical
response). Continuous nebulized β2-agonists are of no greater
benefit than the use of frequent intermittent doses in the same
total hourly dosage.

Anticholinergics
Children with severe exacerbation or moderate exacerbation
with poor response to the initial dose of β2-agonists, are usually
nebulized with combination with nebulized ipratropium

bromide. There is good evidence for the safety and efficacy of
frequent doses of ipratropium bromide (every 20–30 minutes)
used in addition to β2 agonists for the first two hours of a severe
asthma attack. Benefits are more apparent in the most severe
patients.

Corticosteroids

320

ch-69.indd 320

Systemic corticosteroids are pivotal in the management
of acute severe asthma and reduce the need for hospital
admission and prevent a relapse in symptoms after initial
presentation. Benefits can be apparent within 3–4 hours. Both
oral as well as intravenous (IV) steroids have similar efficacy.
Intravenous hydrocortisone (4 mg/kg repeated 4-hourly)
should be reserved for severely affected children who are
unable to retain oral medication.

Second Line Treatment
Children with continuing severe asthma, despite frequent
nebulized β2 agonists and ipratropium bromide plus oral
steroids, and those with life-threatening features, need transfer
to a high dependency unit or PICU to receive second line IV
therapies. There are three options to consider: (1) magnesium
sulfate, (2) aminophylline and (3) continuous IV salbutamol/
terbutaline.

Intravenous or Nebulized Magnesium Sulfate
Magnesium sulfate is a physiological calcium antagonist that
acts by inhibiting the contraction, mediated by the bronchial
smooth muscle. In addition, it interferes with the parasympathetic stimulation and prevents acetylcholine release
to the axon terminal; therefore promoting a bronchodilating

effect. It has been usually recommended as an add-on therapy
after the first hour of treatment with salbutamol and steroids
(GINA 2015, Evidence level A). One large open-labeled trail
from Argentina has shown that magnesium sulfate when used
in the first hour itself can reduce significantly, the percentage
of children who required mechanical ventilation support.
There is now evidence to support use of nebulized isotonic
magnesium sulfate.

Intravenous Aminophylline
There is no evidence that aminophylline is of benefit for
mild to moderate asthma and side effects are common and
troublesome. One well-conducted study has shown evidence of
benefit in severe acute asthma unresponsive to multiple doses
of β2 agonists and steroids, although the loading dose used
was double that currently recommended in UK and one-third
of patients were withdrawn from active medication because of
vomiting. Two studies have compared IV β2 agonists with IV
theophylline/aminophylline. One demonstrated equivalence.
The other resulted in a shorter period of inpatient treatment
among the children receiving an aminophylline bolus followed
by infusion but in the salbutamol arm of the study an infusion
was not given after the bolus dose.

The use of a helium-oxygen gas mixture is another
potentially attractive therapy for the treatment of status
asthmaticus in children. The use of helium-oxygen–driven
aerosolized therapy increases drug delivery by improving gas
exchange to the distal airways.

Key points

))
Acute asthma management involves prompt recognition
of severity and treatment using short-acting β-agonists,
anticholinergics, and systemic corticosteroids

))
Children with severe exacerbations should receive high-dose
short-acting β-agonists mixed with ipratropium bromide as
well as systemic steroids

))
Children with less-severe exacerbations might benefit from
systemic steroids

))
Patients not improving after multiple high-dose systemic
steroids should receive adjunctive therapy, such as intra­
venous magnesium

))
Prepare a written asthma action plan. Ensure proper followup after discharge with an aim to implement a long-term
management plan.

Intravenous Terbutaline
A continuous IV infusion of terbutaline could be used in
children not responding to the above mentioned drugs. This
should be given in a high dependency unit or PICU with
continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and twice
daily electrolyte monitoring. Nebulized bronchodilators
should be continued while the patient is receiving IV
bronchodilators. Once the patient is improving the IV infusion
should be reduced before reducing the frequency of nebulized
bronchodilators. Currently, the availability of this drug is poor
across our country.

Other Modalities
Children not responding to the above measures should be
considered for noninvasive ventilation, IV ketamine, and if
required, intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Management of Bronchiolitis
Preeti Singh, Varinder Singh

INTRODUCTION
Bronchiolitis accounts for significant number of hospital
admission worldwide especially less than 2 years of age. The
American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline
defines bronchiolitis as “a constellation of clinical symptoms
and signs including a viral upper respiratory prodrome
followed by increased respiratory effort and wheezing in
children less than two years of age”.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Bronchiolitis is primarily a disease of infancy, with the first
(and the most severe) episodes occuring between 2–6 months
of age. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common
etiological agent and accounts for 50–80% of cases. In Indian
studies, RSV infection was implicated in 30–70% of children
with bronchiolitis. Other viruses responsible are rhino­
virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza
virus type 3, influenza, and the recently identified human
metapneumovirus (HMPV). Molecular diagnostic techniques
have also revealed that young children with bronchiolitis have
mixed viral infections (10–30%) most commonly with RSV and
either HMPV or rhinovirus. Bronchiolitis shows a seasonal
pattern with highest rates occurring during winter in most
locations and in more tropical and subtropical latitudes during
rainy season. There has been no evidence for a role of bacteria
in etiology of bronchiolitis. Data on synergistic viral-bacterial
infections also are unconvincing.

PATHOGENESIS
Bronchiolitis is characterized by acute inflammation of the
bronchiolar epithelium, with peribronchial infiltration of
white blood cells, mostly mononuclear cells, edema of the
submucosa and adventitia, necrosis of small airway epithelial
cells, increased mucus production, and bronchospasm. Plugs
of sloughed, necrotic epithelium and fibrin in the airways
cause partial or total obstruction to airflow. A “ball-valve”
mechanism results in air trapping distal to obstructed areas,

with subsequent absorption, atelectasis, and a ventilation

obstruction may vary as these areas are cleared, resulting in
rapidly changing clinical signs. Certain underlying conditions,
such as prematurity, chronic lung disease, cardiac disease,
immunodeficiency, and neuromuscular disorders can
predispose a child to a more turbulent course while certain
clinical clues suggest a more likely stormy course (Table 1).

Clinical Pearl
• Bronchiolitis is primarily a disease of infancy with respiratory
syncytial virus being responsible for more than 50% of cases.
Host, anatomical immunologic, environmental and nature of
the viral pathogen plays an important role in severity of clinical
syndrome.

Chapter 70: Management of Bronchiolitis

CLINICAL FEATURES AND COURSE
Bronchiolitis typically starts with fever and rhinorrhea.
After 1–3 days, a prominent staccato-like cough and wheeze
develop. The clinical presentation of bronchiolitis can be
quite variable, both over time and between patients. It can
range from mild respiratory distress with transient events,
such as mucous plugging, to apnea and respiratory failure.
Excessive nasal secretions can cause upper airway obstruction,
with both inspiratory and expiratory noise on auscultation.
Concurrent presence of respiratory symptoms in other family
members is common. On examination child has tachypnea,
varying degree of hypoxemia due to ventilation perfusion
mismatch and increased work of breathing manifested as
nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, subcostal retractions, and
use of accessory muscles. Upon auscultation, diffuse bilateral
wheezes and crackles are often present; the expiratory phase
of respiration can also be prolonged. The liver and spleen can
be palpable due to hyperinflation of the lungs secondary to
air trapping. Other manifestations of upper respiratory tract
infection (URTI), like mild conjunctivitis, otitis media, and
pharyngitis may be present.
The mean duration of illness with bronchiolitis is 15 days,
and the majority of these infections resolve uneventfully
within 3–4 weeks. The mortality rate is less than 1%, being
attributable to apnea or respiratory failure. The association
of bronchiolitis with the subsequent wheezing is not clearly
established as causal. While RSV bronchiolitis actually leads
to long-term changes in the lungs in a proportion of patients
while in others who continue to wheeze later, RSV infection
simply may serve as a marker for a genetic or physiologic/
anatomic predisposition to wheezing.

DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is essentially clinical and does
not require diagnostic testing, but the differential diagnosis
is broad and multifactorial which warrants consideration
(Box 1). The use of complete blood counts has not proved
to be useful in either diagnosing bronchiolitis or guiding
its therapy. A blood gas (capillary, venous, or arterial)
can aid with assessment of gas exchange in a child with
moderate to severe respiratory distress. If a child has poor
oral intake, one can assess electrolyte abnormalities and
extent of dehydration by measuring the plasma blood urea
nitrogen, creatine, and electrolytes. The typical findings
on chest radiograph are hyperinflation and peribronchial
thickening. Areas of atelectasis are not uncommon. Indian
Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Pediatrics
does not recommend the routine use of chest radiography
for diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis. It may be
useful when the hospitalized child does not improve at
the expected rate, if the severity of disease requires further
evaluation, or if another diagnosis is suspected. Laboratory
testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates for identification of
viruses can support patient diagnosis, aid with syndromic
surveillance, but has limited utility and does not aid
individual case management.

ch-70.indd 323

Box 1: Differential diagnoses for acute bronchiolitis
• Virus-induced wheeze of infancy
• Viral and bacterial pneumonias
• Other pulmonary infections (e.g., Mycoplasma, Chlamydia,
tuberculosis)
• Gastroesophageal reflux disease
• Congestive heart failure
• Structural abnormalities, like congenital vascular ring, laryngo­
tracheomalacia, mediastinal mass, bronchogenic cyst, etc.
• Tracheoesophageal fistula
• Foreign body aspiration
• Cystic fibrosis

Clinical Pearl
• The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is essentially clinical, particularly
in a previously healthy infant with first episode of wheezing.

MANAGEMENT
The treatment of bronchiolitis is often debated and no
consistently effective therapy has shown to alter the course of
the disease or its major outcomes. It is critical to remember
that most infants with mild bronchiolitis improve and
resolve spontaneously and hence can be successfully treated
at home. The cornerstone of therapy for bronchiolitis is
supportive care. Infants with moderate to severe respiratory
distress need hospitalization for management of this lifethreatening condition. The need for treatment is either
hypoxemia necessitating supplemental oxygen or the inability
to take adequate fluids by mouth. Monitoring the child with
bronchiolitis for disease progression and complications is
a vital part of supportive care. Table 2 details the current
evidence for the management of acute bronchiolitis.

Supportive Care
Fluid and Hydration Management
Children with bronchiolitis often have potential problem of
dehydration because of decreased intake and increased needs
(due to fever and tachypnea), so fluid and hydration status
should be properly maintained. Care should be taken not to
overhydrate them because edema is an important part of the
pathology of bronchiolitis (excessive antidiuretic hormone
production), which can lead to pulmonary congestion. Breast
feeding should be encouraged as it provides hydration and
confers immunological protection. Nasogastric feedings may
be considered for a child who has decreased oral intake, with
mild to moderate respiratory distress. In infants with diificulty
in feeding, persistent vomiting or with moderate to severe
respiratory distress intravenous fluids should be considered to
maintain hydration. Usual maintainence fluids are needed.

Oxygen Supplementation
The keystone of therapy for bronchiolitis is the administration
of oxygen because hypoxemia is seen in moderate to severe

cases due to ventilation perfusion mismatch. Humidified
oxygen should be administered using nasal cannula, face mask,
or head box and the patient’s respiratory status monitored by
pulse oximetry. In an irritable child one may have to accept the
least threatning but most acceptable manner of oxygen therpy
(like nasal blow by) in which the baby tolerates it. The American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supplemental
oxygen if the hemoglobin oxygen saturation is persistently
below 90%. Their suggested point of discontinuation of
oxygen therapy is when the child’s oxygen saturation can be
maintained at or above 90% with room air and the child is
feeding well, with minimal respiratory distress. Premature or
low birth weight infants, as well as those with chronic lung
disease or congenital heart disease have lower tolerance for
hypoxemia and a higher likelihood of severe disease, so need
to be careful while discontinuing oxygen.

Nasal Decongestion

324

ch-70.indd 324

Children with bronchiolitis suffer from nasal blockade due to
thick copious nasal secretions. Cleaning of nostrils by instilling
saline drops and gentle suction may help to relieve nasal block
and facilitate feeding. Parents should be taught this effective
self-clearing of the nasal passages before discharge from
hospital.

Clinical Pearl
• The cornerstone of therapy for bronchiolitis is supportive
care with maintenance of adequate hydration and nutrition,
ensuring adequate oxygenation, and nasal decongestion
using nasal saline washes.

Bronchodilators
The evidence to support the routine use of bronchodilators in
the management of bronchiolitis is not very strong, and the
practice remains controversial. The Cochrne review does not
show any benfit of short-acting β-2 agonists in the manage­
ment of bronchiolitis. Another meta-analysis demonstrated
superiority of epinephrine compared to placebo for short-term
outcomes for outpatients.
If the decision is made to use an inhaled bronchodilator,
it should be based on personal or family history of atopy
or asthma; if present, salbutamol inhalation may be given,
otherwise a trial of epinephrine inhalation may be given.
Further doses of either medication may be continued only on
documentation of improvement.

Corticosteroids
The use of systemic corticosteroid in bronchiolitis is still
controversial. A recent Cochrane review conducted in
2010 including 17 trials with a total of 2596 infants did not
demonstrate a benefit in significantly reducing outpatient
visits, hospital admission rate, clinical score after 12 hours
and length of stay for inpatients. Combined dexamethasone
and epinephrine may reduce outpatient admissions, but result
from this single study at best be called exploratory and safety
data is limited. Currently, there is no definitive evidence to
support the use of inhaled corticosteroids for acute or longterm benefit in bronchiolitis.

Mucolytics
Mucous plugging plays a significant role in the small airway
obstruction of bronchiolitis and interventions, like hypertonic
saline and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) decrease epithelial
edema and elasticity and viscosity of mucus which could
improve clinical outcomes. Hypertonic saline inhalation may
be considered as potential treatment for bronchiolitis. Recent
randomized controlled trial reported that high volume normal
saline was as effective as 3% saline in children with mild
bronchiolitis.

Antibiotics
As bronchiolitis is a viral disease, antibiotics are not useful
or necessary. Institution of antibiotics should be considered
only when a change in course of illness suggests the possibility
of secondary bacterial infection. A recent review did not
find sufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for
bronchiolitis, but concluded that research may be justified
to identify a subgroup of patients who may benefit from
antibiotics. It also stressed that the future research should

focus on determining the reasons that clinicians use antibiotics
so readily for bronchiolitis, so that the antibiotic usage in
bronchiolitis is reduced and also the clinician anxiety about
not using antibiotics is reduced.

Mechanical Ventilation and
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
Assisted ventilation is indicated in infants with moderate to
severe bronchiolitis with progressive clinical deterioration,
i.e. increasing respiratory distress, apnea and poor peripheral
perfusion. In severe bronchiolitis early intervention in form of
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) did not produce
any conclusive evidence to decrease the need for intubation.
Current evidence is inconclusive regarding routine use of
CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis. The use of chest
physiotherapy is discouraged in children with bronchiolitis
as it did not reduce supplemental oxygen requirement, or
length of hospital stay rather it may increase the distress and
irritability of ill infants.

Antiviral
Ribavarin is the only antiviral agent licensed for use with RSV
bronchiolitis. Routine use of ribavirin is not recommended
for children with bronchiolitis. It may be considered in high
risk infants (immunocompromised and/or hemodynamically

ch-70.indd 325

significant cardiopulmonary disease) and in infants requiring
mechanical ventilation.

Others
Current evidence suggests that surfactant therapy may have
potential use in acute severe bronchiolitis requiring mechanical
ventilation in decreasing duration of mechanical ventilation
and intensive care unit stay. There is a need for larger trials with
adequate power and to establish beneficial role of administration
of surfactant in infants with severe bronchiolitis. Currently, there
is insufficient evidence to recommend leukotriene modifier and
heliox use for bronchiolitis.

PREVENTION
There is no effective therapy that can improve outcome,
if administered early in course of bronchiolitis. Hand
decontamination is the most important step in preventing
nosocomial spread of RSV. Clinicians should educate health
personnel and family members on hand sanitation.
Currently, no vaccine exists for the prevention of RSV
infection. Passive immunoprophylaxis using palivizumab
[humanized mouse immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal
antibody] to high-risk infants (Table 3) before RSV season has
documented marked reduction in the severity of illness and
rate of hospitalization after RSV infection. It is administered

Management of Bronchiectasis
Kana R Jat

INTRODUCTION

CAUSES OF BRONCHIECTASIS

Bronchiectasis is a disease of conducting airways charac­
terized clinically by chronic moist or productive cough,
airway hyperreactivity, recurrent respiratory infections,
and failure to thrive and radiologically by dilated airways.
Chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD), is a broad category
with sign and symptoms similar to bronchiectasis with or
without radiological evidence of dilated airways. There is lack
of consensus whether bronchiectasis and CSLD represent
a spectrum of common disease or are different entities.
Empyema and lung abscess are considered different from both
bronchiectasis and CSLD.

Clinical Pearl
• Never ignore a child with chronic wet cough.

The prevalence of bronchiectasis had decreasing trend
in developed countries, but it is still an important chronic
respiratory disease in developing countries including India. In
early 90s, bronchiectasis was present in approximate 1% children
at pediatric respiratory centers in developed countries.

Bronchiectasis is secondary to many diseases or conditions
that injure the conducting airways with recurrent respiratory
infections (Table 1). Bronchiectasis may be grouped in two
major categories: (1) associated with cystic fibrosis (CF); and
(2) non-CF bronchiectasis. The both group may differ in age
of onset, airway colonization, disease severity and distribution,
extra pulmonary manifestations, treatment strategies, and
overall prognosis. Bronchiectasis is mainly secondary to CF
in industrialized countries, whereas in developing countries
postinfectious bronchiectasis forms a major chunk. In a study
from Korea, the underlying etiology was identified in 85.8%
(79/92) patients that included bronchiolitis obliterans (32.6%),
childhood respiratory infection (20.6%), interstitial lung
disease (17.3%), immunodeficiency (8.6%), primary ciliary
dyskinesia (PCD) (4.3%), and CF (2%).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF BRONCHIECTASIS
Bronchiectasis is characterized by tortuous and dilated airways
filled with infected secretions with airway obstruction. There

is neutrophilic inflammation, peribronchial fibrosis, and
accompanying pulmonary and bronchial vascular changes.
Pathologically, bronchiectasis may be classified as cylindrical (or
tubular), varicose (or fusiform), and cystic (or saccular). Cystic
bronchiectasis mostly reflects advanced irreversible disease.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Chronic wet sounding cough with or without sputum
expectoration is hallmark of bronchiectasis. Other clinical
features include failure to thrive, hemoptysis, exertional
dyspnea, wheezing, recurrent respiratory infections, clubbing
and/or chest hyperinflation. Auscultation of chest may reveal
coarse crackles, and/or rhonchi or it may be normal. Cyanosis
and pulmonary hypertension are late ominous signs of
bronchiectasis.

Clinical Pearl

Fig. 1: Bronchiectasis in a child with allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis (Arrow: dilated central bronchus)

• Every wheezing child does not have asthma and every
asthmatic child does not wheeze. Clinical examination is
a never ending weapon for a physician: Get alerted if you
find clubbing and coarse crackles in a child with respiratory
symptoms.

Clinical Pearl

Bronchiectasis may be generalized or localized to
one or more lobes. In localized form, left lower lobe is
most commonly affected followed by right upper lobe.
Airway hyperreactivity is not uncommon in children with
bronchiectasis ranging from 26–74%. Presence of cough
and wheezing may not always suggest asthma, rather it
may be due to airway obstruction and increased secretion
in bronchiectasis. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
may coexist with bronchiectasis and should be looked for
and treated when clinically indicated. Complications of
bronchiectasis may include pulmonary hypertension with/
without cor pulmonale, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy,
systemic amyloidosis, scoliosis, and social problems.

DIAGNOSIS

328

ch-71.indd 328

Once bronchiectasis is suspected clinically, child should be
evaluated to confirm the diagnosis, to find extend and severity
of disease, and to identify underlying cause. Bronchiectasis
may be suspected on chest X-ray but high-resolution computed
tomography (HRCT) scans of the chest is investigation of
choice to diagnose and to define extend of bronchiectasis.
Chest X-ray may reveal peribronchial thickening, bronchial
crowding, atelectasis, and persistent infiltrates in early stages;
and cystic spaces, air-fluid levels, dilated thick-walled bronchi,
and mucus plugging in advanced stage.
Diagnostic criteria for bronchiectasis are based on HRCT
chest findings. A dilated bronchus having size greater than
nearby artery is considered diagnostic of bronchiectasis in
HRCT chest (Fig. 1). This appears as signet rings or tramlines
depending on precise orientation of bronchi to the plane of
section.

• High-resolution computed tomography chest (HRCT) is useful
to confirm and to define extent of bronchiectasis, but do not
delay treatment if facility for HRCT is not available. If treated at
very early stage, much of the disease can be reversed.

Other HRCT chest findings in bronchiectasis may include
mucus plugs, bronchial wall thickening, lack of normal
airway tapering towards lung periphery, visualization of the
peripheral bronchi within 1 cm of the costal pleural surface,
air-fluid levels in dilated bronchi, a linear array or cluster of
cysts, mosaic perfusion, string of pearls (ectatic bronchi with
beaded appearance), and air trapping.
After diagnosing bronchiectasis, try to identify underlying
etiology by performing sweat test, immunological workup,
sputum analysis, workup for tuberculosis and other
infections, bronchoscopy, tests for primary ciliary dyskinesia,
gastroesophageal reflux (GER), or allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis (ABPA), as suggested by associated clinical
features. There are many scoring systems to assess severity of
bronchiectasis based on chest X-ray and HRCT chest findings,
but later one are preferred (Bhalla HRCT score, Reiff scoring
system, etc.). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) may also be
performed to assess the severity of bronchiectasis, but there
is lack of good correlation between PFTs and HRCT scores. A
parent cough-specific quality of life questionnaire is available
to assess quality of life in children with bronchiectasis.
Isolation rate for micro-organism from sputum or broncho­
alveolar lavage (BAL) in children varies between 53–67%.
Common pathogens isolated in children with bronchiectasis
include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and
Hemophilus influenzae non-type b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exacerbation in bronchiectasis
may be suggested by increased sputum production, purulent
sputum, increase in cough severity, and/or cough changing
from dry to weight.

Chapter 71: Management of Bronchiectasis

TREATMENT
Therapy for bronchiectasis may be needed for acute exacer­
bations and chronic therapy for persistent bronchiectasis.
The chronic therapy is different for CF- and non-CF-related
bronchiectasis. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment
of bronchiectasis and underlying etiology has paramount
importance in reducing morbidity and mortality associated
with bronchiectasis.

Clinical Pearl
• If you diagnose bronchiectasis, do not look for higher center; it
may reasonably be managed at any center.

Management of bronchiectasis requires a team approach
comprising pediatrician, nurse, physiotherapist, social worker,
nutritionist, etc. The general management for bronchiectasis
is discussed here. The therapeutic options for bronchiectasis
include: (1) rational use of antibiotics (for maintenance and
exacerbation), (2) airway hydration and mucoactive drugs,
(3) effective chest physiotherapy (airway clearance methods),
(4) use for anti-inflammatory and antisecretagogues, (5)
bronchodilators, (6) good nutritional support, (7) treatment
of comorbid conditions and complications, (8) surgical
intervention if required, (9) education and social support, and
(10) prevention.

Rational Use of Antibiotics
Long-term antibiotics may be used as aerosol or orally
for bronchiectasis. Data regarding efficacy of antibiotics
for chronic maintenance in children with non-CFbronchiectasis are limited. Till further evidence is available,
chronic maintenance antibiotics should be used for a group
of selected children only, e.g., with frequent exacerbations,
children having severe lung disease with documented
pseudomonas endobronchial infection (inhaled tobramycin
may be useful) and CF. Long term use of oral macrolide
therapy is found to be beneficial for both CF and non-CF
children with bronchiectasis; mainly because of its antiinflammatory and antisecretagogue properties, rather than
due to antimicrobial properties. Acute exacerbations must be
treated with antibiotics based on isolated pathogen and local
antibiotic sensitivity pattern.

Airway Hydration and Mucoactive Drugs
Mucus clearance is impaired more in children with CF
and PCD as compared to idiopathic bronchiectasis. Use
of inhaled hypertonic saline (6–7%) is associated with
decreased exacerbation and improved lung function in CF
bronchiectasis, but data is limited for non-CF bronchiectasis.
Risk of bronchospasm following hydrating agents can be
minimized with pre-treatment with inhaled salbutamol. To
further enhance mucus clearance, mucolytic agents may be
used. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) is
efficacious in CF, but is contraindicated in non-CF-related

ch-71.indd 329

bronchiectasis as it had worsening of symptoms in non-CF
bronchiectasis. Alternative to rhDNase is N-acetylcysteine,
but there is lack of evidence for its efficacy. Role of
anticholinergics and bromhexine is not established either.

Chest Physiotherapy
(Airway Clearance Methods)
Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) with spontaneous
or directed cough help in improving mucus clearance. A
recent Cochrane review revealed that ACTs appear to be
safe and beneficial for both adults and children with stable
bronchiectasis. The role of these techniques in people with
an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. There
are many ACTs, but data is lacking to suggest superiority of
one over other and choices may be individualized. Regular
physical activity is also encouraged for children with
bronchiectasis.

Anti-inflammatory Agents
There is lack of evidence for or against use of inhaled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in the management
of bronchiectasis in adults or children; one small trial of
inhaled indomethacin in adults reported a reduction in
sputum production and improved dyspnea. Use of high-dose
ibuprofen for 4 years in children with CF showed a reduction
in the rate of lung function decline and improved weight gain
but no change in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations.
There are no randomized controlled trials regarding efficacy
of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in
patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. Inhaled corticosteroids
(ICS) failed to benefit in adults with stable bronchiectasis;
therefore routine use is not recommended. There is lack
of trials of ICS for children and for acute exacerbation of
bronchiectasis. Inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial if
there is associated asthma. Long-term oral steroids in CFbronchiectasis improved lung function, but with significant
adverse effects; therefore not recommended to treat CFrelated bronchiectasis. There is lack of trials for use of oral
steroids in acute and stable non-CF bronchiectasis both
in children and adults except for ABPA, where steroids are
indicated whether bronchiectasis is present or absent. Thus,
steroid therapy in children with bronchiectasis is related to
etiology and it’s use should be individualized.

Bronchodilators
There is insufficient evidence for or against use of short or
long acting β-2 agonists, adrenergics, and leukotriene receptor
anta-agonists for management of bronchiectasis and their
use should be individualized. Increased cough or wheezing in
children with bronchiectasis should be treated as exacerbation
at first instance.
Data regarding use of conventional sequence of broncho­
dilator, hypertonic saline, DNase, ACT, and aerosol antibiotics,
frequently used in CF patients, are lacking for non-CF-related
bronchiectasis in children and treatment in these patient must
be individualized.

Section 8: Pulmonology

SURGICAL TREATMENT
There are no randomized trials comparing medical versus
surgical treatment. Usual indication of surgery is failure
of medical therapy in localized disease. Other indications
for surgery may include severe persistent hemoptysis
uncontrolled by bronchial artery embolization, severe chronic
symptoms, and growth failure in localized disease. Surgery
should not be considered for generalized disease, children
below 6 years of age and in bronchiectasis with mild to
moderate symptoms. At present, perioperative morbidity and
mortality is minimum after lobectomy or pneumonectomy.
Outcome after lung transplantation in children with non-CF
bronchiectasis is not available.

PREVENTION
Children with bronchiectasis should receive routine vacci­
nation as per national schedule. Limited evidence suggests that
routine 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination in children with
bronchiectasis may be useful, though robust trials are needed.
Role of new 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine requires further
trials for young children. Although, there is neither evidence
for, nor against, routine influenza vaccination for children
and adults with bronchiectasis, it may be used if affordability
is not the problem. Children with bronchiectasis should have
no/minimal environmental tobacco-smoke exposure as it
increases susceptibility to respiratory infections.

An approach to a child with suspected bronchiectasis is
shown in algorithm 1.
Prognosis of bronchiectasis depends on underlying
etiology; extent and severity of disease at diagnosis, frequency
of exacerbations; base-line lung function; rate of decline in
FEV1, bacterial density and neutrophils in sputum; and nature
of treatment. Delayed diagnosis, presence of asthma, bilateral
lung involvement, and saccular bronchiectasis are some of
poor prognostic factors. Bronchiectasis may be reversible in
certain situations, e.g., after removal of chronic foreign body.
Although lack of mortality data for pediatric bronchiectasis;
nearly one-fourth children had respiratory failure in an about
7 years follow-up. With availability of better and inhaled
antibiotics, ACTs, and good nutrition support, the prognosis of
bronchiectasis has improved with time.

CONCLUSION
Bronchiectasis is chronic disease of conducting airways
with a variety of underlying conditions. Data is lacking for
effective treatment in children with non-CF bronchiectasis.
Early diagnosis and aggressive multidisciplinary therapy with
good nutritional and social support has improved prognosis
of bronchiectasis in children. More robust clinical trials for
various treatment options are required especially for children
with non-CF bronchiectasis. In developing countries, control
of infectious diseases is needed to curb the load of postinfectious bronchiectasis.

Management of Congestive Heart Failure in
Infants and Children: An Algorithmic Approach
M Zulfikar Ahamed

INTRODUCTION
Heart failure in infancy and childhood is “a clinical syndrome
which reflects the inability of the heart to pump blood to meet
the metabolic requirements of the body, including those needs
incurred by growth; or able to do so at a higher filling pressure”.
It is a complex syndrome that can result from any structural or
functional disorder that can impair the ability of ventricle(s) to
fill with or eject blood.
While adult congestive heart failure (CHF) is often due
to coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, valvular
heart diseases, and cardiomyopathies, infants and children
have CHF primarily due to congenital heart disease (CHD),
valvular heart diseases, and cardiomyopathies. Overall,
75% of CHF in pediatric population is due to CHD and the
rest due to acquired heart diseases. About 80% of CHF
occurs in infants (<1 year). While in market economies,
cardiomyopathies, CHD, and postoperative CHD cause CHF
in that order, in India, the leading causes of pediatric CHF are
CHD, rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease (RF/RHD),
and cardiomyopathies.
Pathophysiologically, CHF can be divided into three types,
which are as follows:
• Type I: CHF due to abnormal loading conditions. It can be
due to preload abnormality or afterload problem. This is
the most common variety of CHF in infants
{{ Preload: ventricular septal defects (VSD), patent ductus
arteriosus (PDA), mitral regurgitation (MR)
{{ Afterload: aortic stenosis (AS), coarctation of aorta
• Type II: CHF due to abnormality of contractility (inotropy)—
dilated cardiomyopathy
• Type III: CHF due to abnormality of diastolic function
(lusitropy)—hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
In addition, heart rate abnormalities (very slow rate or
very fast rate), such as complete heart block (CHB), and
supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), can also cause CHF.

ch-72.indd 332

Type I Congestive Heart Failure
•
•
•
•
•

Left to right shunt: VSD, PDA, aortopulmonary window
(APW), atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)
Admixture CHD: total anomalous pulmonary venous
connection (TAPVC), single ventricle, double outlet right
ventricle (DORV), truncus arteriosus
Valvular regurgitation: MR, aortic regurgitation
Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction: AS,
coarctation of aorta
Rheumatic fever, carditis.

Type II Congestive Heart Failure
•
•
•
•
•

Dilated cardiomyopathy
Myocarditis
Postoperative CHD
Tachycardiomyopathy
Chronic RHD with left ventricular dysfunction.
Congestive heart failure can be caused mostly by structural
lesions. Occasionally, functional heart diseases can also cause
CHF. They could be either remediable or nonremediable
(Algorithm 1).

Chapter 72: Management of Congestive Heart Failure in Infants and Children: An Algorithmic Approach
Most congenital structural heart diseases are remediable
either surgically or by intervention. Many acquired heart
diseases are also amenable to correction, e.g., mitral stenosis,
MR; some are not—dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Tachycardiomyopathy is a functional heart
disease which is remediable, by conversion to sinus rhythm.

CAUSES
Causes of CHF in infancy and childhood have a chronological
order. This phenomenon is quite useful, looking for and
identifying a cause for CHF in childhood.

Fetal Causes
•
•
•

Congenital heart disease: Ebstein anomaly, systemic
arteriovenous fistula
Others: intrauterine myocarditis
Arrhythmia: CHB, SVT.

Day One Causes (0–24 h)
•
•

Ebstein anomaly, systemic arteriovenous fistula, absent
pulmonary valve syndrome, severe MR, myocarditis
Complete heart block, SVT.

First Week Causes (1–7 Days)
•
•
•

Critical left heart obstruction: AS, hypoplastic left heart
syndrome, coarctation of aorta, interrupted aortic arch
Obstructed TAPVC
Extension of day one causes.

1–4 Weeks Causes
•
•
•
•

Large left to right shunts: VSD, PDA, AVSD
Admixture lesions: TAPVC, DORV, single ventricle, truncus
arteriosus
Less critical CHD: coarctation, AS
Rare defects: Pompe, anomalous origin of the left coronary
artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA),
endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE).

1 Months–1 Year Causes
•
•
•

Left to right shunts: PDA, APW, VSD, AVSD
Admixture lesions
Acquired: SVT, dilated cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis.

RECOGNITION OF
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE IN INFANTS
Clinical recognition of CHF in infancy (Box 1) is different
from that of an older child. The classical quartet of findings
are tachycardia, tachypnea, tender hepatomegaly, and
cardiomegaly. Others are S3 gallop, prolonged capillary refill
time, and bibasal crepitation. Elevated jugular venous pressure
(JVP), pedal edema, and hypotension are less common
manifestations.
Functional assessment in an infant or child with CHF will
be based on New York Heart Association (older child) or Ross
(infants) classification.
Ross (2002) classification:
1. No symptom, no feeding difficulty, normal growth
2. Tachypnea on feed, sweating on feed, normal growth
3. Significant tachypnea/sweating on feed, retractions at rest,
growth failure
4. All the above on rest also.

EVALUATION
Evaluation of CHF includes recognition and characterization
of CHF and investigations (Algorithm 2).

Investigations
The investigations can be either definitive or nondefinitive.
One has to decide whether CHF is acute or chronic. Acute
CHF could be either primary or decompensated. Both chronic
and acute CHF can be either responsive or nonresponsive
(refractory) (Algorithm 3).
Investigations can be either definitive or nondefinitive
(Algorithm 4).

dependent left sided critical lesions, sepsis, hypoxemic
ischemic problems, and arrhythmia
• Acute/subacute CHF: occurs in post tricuspid left to
right shunts, obstructive lesions, admixture lesions, and
cardiomyopathies
• Chronic CHF: occurs due to cardiomyopathies, valvular
heart disease, and moderate left to right shunts.

(e.g., figure of “8” in TAPVC). It can also sort out primary or
additional lung issues.
Practically, all causes of CHF in infancy will cause cardio­
megaly (cardiothoracic ratio >50% in a child, >55% in infants,
>60% in neonates). The exceptions could be obstructed TAPVC
or cor triatriatum.

Electrocardiography
A 14-lead electrocardiography (ECG) with or without a rhythm
strip (lead II) is quite useful. It is a must in all forms of CHF.
Electrocardiography can be a pointer to a specific CHD (e.g.,
biventricular hypertrophy in large VSD) or characteristic of a
CHD (e.g., left deviation of the QRS axis and right ventricular
hypertrophy in AVSD). It can diagnose tachyarrhythmia as
cause of CHF (e.g., SVT leading to “dilated cardiomyopathy”
like picture) and can pick up drug toxicity (e.g., digitoxicity).
 Algorithm 3
Congestive heart failure types

Echocardiography
It is the most useful tool in evaluating CHF in infants and
children. It can virtually diagnose all structural heart lesions,
both congenital and acquired. It can pick up diastolic
abnormalities and hemodynamic problems such as PAH
(Table 1).

Others

 Algorithm 4
Evaluation of congestive heart failure

Brain natriuretic peptide is useful in assessing CHF in infants,
especially recent onset (acute). It will help in differentiating
between cardiac and respiratory causes of distress. The normal
value is less than 30 pg/mL. Abnormal value (>100 pg/mL)
will indicate cardiac cause of respiratory distress with high
sensitivity and specificity.
Troponins, either troponin T or troponin I can be useful in
conditions like myocarditis.
Radionuclide studies, cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging, and computed tomography are occasionally useful in
evaluating cause of CHF, especially in adult CHD. Postoperative
catheteri­
zation and endomyocardial biopsy could also be
utilized in evaluating cause of CHF.

TREATMENT
Treatment of CHF involves three facets, which are as follows:
1. Treating the cause
2. Treating the precipitating cause
3. Treating the congestive state.

Chapter 72: Management of Congestive Heart Failure in Infants and Children: An Algorithmic Approach
Mostly, causes of CHF in infancy are mechanical problems
which need mechanical solutions—either surgical or
interventional.
Monitoring is an important factor in treating CHF. We can
monitor:
• Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, capillary refill
time
• Cardiomegaly, S3, murmur, lungs
• Urine output, pulse oxymetry/arterial blood gas, renal
function.
Drug therapy in CHF in infants and children is a
temporizing measure which could be a short-term or longterm bridge. It is also an initial lifesaver. In addition, some
drugs may eventually “correct” the abnormality, e.g., prosta­
glandin E1 (PGE1) or adenosine (Algorithm 5).

Management of Acute Congestive Heart Failure
Acute CHF can be either primary or decompensated
(Algorithm 8).
Management of acute CHF will include admission into
pediatric intensive care unit. General measures include
temperature control, oxygen supply, alkali therapy, sepsis
management, and metabolic correction.
Specific measures will be by using intravenous (IV)
inotrope, IV diuretic, and IV vasodilators. Targeted therapy will
be using phosphodiesterase inhibitors, sildenafil, adenosine,
or ibuprofen, according to indications. Additional measures
will be IV access, multiorgan protection, and mechanical
ventilation (Algorithms 9 and 10).

Approach to a Child
with Chest Pain
Vikas Kohli, Neeraj Agarwal

INTRODUCTION
Chest pain is not an uncommon complaint with which
children present to the pediatric outpatient. It is not easy to
differentiate the cardiac form non cardiac chest pain. Cardiac
origin of chest pain is not the most common cause, but, it is
definitely one of the most serious causes, and potentially
can result in mortality also rarely. Definitely chest pain with
exertion indicates cardiac origin and postural chest pain may
indicate pericardial effusion.
This chapter helps localise the cause of chest pain and
focuses of cardiac origin of chest pain.

CAUSES OF CHEST PAIN
Chest pain in a child is often benign, but cardiac and serious
life-threatening causes do exist. The differential diagnosis
is exhaustive and in most of the cases, etiology can be found
out by thorough history and examination. Major causes of
chest pain can be grouped as: musculoskeletal, pulmonary,
psychological, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and idiopathic (Box 1).
In general, the most frequent cause reported is
musculoskeletal pain. Approach to pain lies in history and
examination leading to source of pain. Specific features which
pinpoint to an organ system should be remembered.

Chest Wall
Chest wall trauma or a new strenuous physical activity are a
frequent cause for chest pain. New intense physical activity
is an important source and such type of pain peaks in 48
hours of activity. This pain is reproducible by palpation or by
repeating the particular action. Chest wall deformities, like
pectus excavatum/carinatum, can also be associated with
musculoskeletal chest pain and thorough general examination
should pick up these findings.
Precordial catch syndrome is a clinical diagnosis described
as a sharp pain of sudden onset localized to the anterior chest
wall that occurs mostly at rest. It tends to last from a few seconds
to 3 minutes and may be exacerbated by taking a deep breath.

ch-73.indd 338

Breast tenderness can be physiologic during thelarche,
or caused by infectious or inflammatory conditions such as
mastitis.
Cutaneous chest wall pain may occur during an episode
of herpes zoster, in a unilateral dermatome distribution and
may precede the development of characteristic skin findings
by several days.
Costochondritis is pain localized to costal cartilage and can
be elicited by tenderness at costochondral junction. There is
no joint inflammation, involves two to four joints, is unilateral,
and exacerbated by deep breathing. Tietze syndrome is a
specific form of costochondritis characterized by localized,
painful, nonsuppurative costochondral swelling involving
single costochondral junction.
Slipping rib syndrome is an unusual cause of lower chest
pain that results when the medial fibrous attachments of the
8th, 9th, or 10th ribs are inadequate or ruptured. Pain can be
reproduced by hooking the fingers under the lowest costal
cartilages and drawing them anteriorly and superiorly.
Hypersensitive xiphoid syndrome is uncommon in
children and can be diagnosed easily because digital pressure
on the xiphoid process reproduces the pain.

Pulmonary
Most common pulmonary causes are reactive airway diseases;
auscultation, chest X-ray, or a pulmonary function test (PFT)
can get the diagnosis. Pleurodynia (caused by coxsackie virus)
is characterized by fever, pleuritic chest pain, and pleural rub.
Pleuritis can be seen in children with infections, collagen
vascular disease, and malignancy.

Clinical Pearl
• Chest pain only during exertion is a significant indicator of
heart disease, but exercise induced asthma will also present
only during exertion. However, asthma mostly will be
associated with coughing followed by chest pain.

Chapter 73: Approach to a Child with Chest Pain
Box 1: Causes of chest pain in pediatrics
Chest wall and musculoskeletal
• Chest wall strain/trauma (exercise, overuse injury, forceful
coughing, myositis, rib fracture)
• Skeletal anomaly (chest wall or thoracic spine, cervical ribs,
slipping rib, osteomyelitis, thoracic outlet obstruction)
• Costochondritis/Tietze syndrome
• Slipping rib syndrome
• Precordial catch syndrome
• Breast tenderness
• Cutaneous (e.g., herpes zoster)
Cardiovascular
• Arrhythmias
• Coronary artery disease (anomalous coronary arteries), acute
Kawasaki disease (coronary arteritis), premature atherosclerosis
(e.g., dyslipidemia), congenital coronary artery aneurysm,
coronary artery vasospasm (toxicologic ingestion as cocaine/
marijuana)
• Structural [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular stenosis
(pulmonary, aortic), mitral valve prolapse, ruptured sinus of
Valsalva, coarctation of aorta], aortic aneurysm or dissection
(Marfan, Turner, and Noonan syndromes), congenital absence of
pericardium
• Myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis
• Pulmonary hypertension
Respiratory
• Reactive airway disease, pneumonia, pneumothorax/
pneumomediastinum
• Pulmonary embolism
• Pleuritis/pleural effusion (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus),
pleurodynia (coxsackievirus)
• Chronic cough, foreign body aspiration
Abdominal and gastrointestinal
• Esophagitis (gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic
esophagitis, bulimia, pill esophagitis)
• Gastritis, pancreatitis
• Esophageal spasm/dysmotility
• Foreign body
• Hiatus hernia
• Referred pain from abdominal trauma (Kehr’s sign)
Neurologic
• Migraine, spinal nerve root compression
Psychiatric
• Anxiety, phobia, somatoform disorder (e.g., conversion),
depression, emotional stress
Hematologic and oncologic
• Sickle cell disease (crisis) and tumor (chest wall, thoracic, or
mediastinal)

Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum may occur after an
episode of bronchiolitis, choking/aspiration, or after inhalation
of cocaine/marijuana. Pneumothorax should be suspected in
a child with unexplained dyspnea, tachypnea, or decreased
breath sounds. Pneumomediastinum should be suspected
if subcutaneous emphysema or Hamman sign (precordial
crackles that correlate with the heartbeat) are present.

ch-73.indd 339

Clinical Pearl
• Normal auscultation of lung fields and heart sounds
significantly rules out a life-threatening cause of chest pain.

Pulmonary embolism is rare in healthy children, but may
be seen in the presence of risk factors, such as coagulopathy,
a central venous catheter, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome,
major surgery, trauma, or sepsis. Ventilation perfusion scan is
usually diagnostic. It should be suspected in cases who present
with dyspnea, cyanosis, or hemoptysis.

Gastrointestinal
Chest pain due to gastric causes is common in childhood
and a detailed history for dietary pattern, abdominal signs/
symptoms like burning epigastric pain, constipation, high
intake of fast food, irregular dietary behavior, relationship
of pain with meals, and epigastric tenderness should point
towards gastric etiology. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is the
most frequent gastric cause for chest pain in children.
Eosinophilic esophagitis may cause chest pain because of
esophageal inflammation, dysmotility, and reflux.
Coins and other objects lodged in the esophagus typically
present with chest pain that is often accompanied by drooling
and dysphagia.
Pill esophagitis is chemical irritation of the esophageal
mucosa from certain medications, particularly iron pre­
parations, tetracyclines, and chronic usage of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents. The pill esophagitis is common in
young adolescent patients who typically ingest a tetracycline
capsule with too little water and present with chest pain,
dysphagia, and occasionally hemoptysis.

Cardiac
Cardiovascular disease is identified in only 2–5% of pediatric
patients with chest pain. The presence of dyspnea on exertion,
palpitations, or abnormal cardiac auscultation has been found
to be statistically significantly related to a cardiac etiology.
Acute myocardial infarction has been described in
association with coronary artery anomalies, congenital heart
disease, Kawasaki disease, familial hypercholesterolemia,
sickle cell disease, cardiac myxoma, hypercoagulable states,
substance abuse, and certain metabolic conditions such as
homocystinuria and mucopolysaccharidosis. It is diagnosed
by classical symptoms (persistent crushing chest pain may/
may not radiate to neck/arm, sweating, and dyspnea), serial
electrocardiography (ECG), and elevated cardiac enzymes
(troponin I/creatine phosphokinase-MB).
Congenital coronary artery abnormalities mainly
involve anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the
pulmonary artery. It is often identified when the pulmonary
artery pressure declines, usually around 2–3 months of age.
Patients may present with crying, poor feeding, and signs of
congestive heart failure. Anomalous origin of the left coronary
artery from the pulmonary artery may also present in later
childhood with angina pain. The typical ECG pattern is that

339

Section 9: Cardiology

340

ch-73.indd 340

of an anterolateral infarction with large and wide Q waves, ST
changes, and T wave inversion in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. Other
coronary artery abnormalities, including anomalous origin of
the left main coronary artery or right coronary artery from the
contralateral sinus of Valsalva and hypoplastic coronary arteries
may also present in childhood. Coronary artery abnormalities
can be picked up or suspected by echocardiography and
later confirmed by angiography. Kawasaki disease has been
associated with myocardial infarction both in the acute and
subacute phases and as a long-term consequence. Infarction
can occur during the acute phase caused by coronary arteritis/
aneurysmal rupture or during resolution caused by obstruction
or stenosis.
Arrhythmias are one of the more common causes of
cardiac-related chest pain in children. Tachyarrhythmias may
cause chest pain because of a reduction in myocardial blood
flow. Hyperthyroidism should be ruled out in all patients with
tachyarrhythmia.
Structural heart disease in form of obstructive lesions
mostly presents with a pathological heart murmur. Left
ventricular outflow obstruction caused by aortic stenosis or
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes pain that is typically
exertional and is caused by subendocardial ischemia. In
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy/obstruction, the physical
examination is characterized by a harsh systolic ejection
murmur. Myocardial ischemia has also been reported in
children with sickle cell disease. In a study of pediatric sickle
cell patients with a history of chest pain, heart failure, abnormal
ECG, left ventricular dilation, or hypokinetic left ventricle, 64%
had perfusion defects on thallium-201 single-photon emission
computed tomography (CT). Three children who were started
on hydroxyurea therapy underwent repeat single-photon
emission CT, and all showed improvement. No occlusion of
coronary arteries was found, suggesting that pathology of the
microcirculation is responsible for the defects.
Myocarditis is a rare, but serious cause of chest pain in
children. Children present with symptoms of chest pain,
palpitations, dyspnea, sweating, giddiness, syncope, and signs
of heart failure (congestive cardiac failure). Electrocardiography
and chest radiography is mostly suggestive of diagnosis.
Laboratory abnormalities include elevated troponin, elevated
creatine kinase, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation
rate. Diagnosis can be confirmed with echocardiography.
Pericarditis is diagnosed by pericardial rub or distant heart
sounds and endocarditis is suspected with prolonged fever.
Partial or complete congenital absence of the pericardium
is rare, but may produce murmur that is heard best at the
apex and lower left sternal border. An increase in the intensity
of the murmur is seen when the patient assumes an upright
posture from a squatting, sitting, or supine position, and with
the Valsalva maneuver. A decrease in intensity is heard after
going from a standing to a sitting or squatting position, or with
passive elevation of the legs. The decrease in intensity occurs
when increased ventricular filling increases the size of the
outflow tract and decreases the gradient across the obstruction.
Mitral valve prolapse has been reported in pediatric
patients with chest pain. It has been hypothesized that severe

mitral valve prolapse could cause pain because of papillary
muscle ischemia. Children with severe pulmonary stenosis
or pulmonary hypertension are also at risk for myocardial
ischemia. Pain in such cases often occurs with exercise. Most
common associations are dyspnea on exertion and syncope.
Aortic aneurysm and dissection have been described both
in healthy pediatric patients and in those with known risk
factors such as bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta,
and valvular aortic stenosis. Other causes include Marfan
syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, trauma,
cocaine use, and weight lifting. Pectus excavatum may be
associated with aortic root dilation, even when other stigmata
of Marfan syndrome are absent. The pain of aortic dissection is
often described as severe and tearing. It tends to be located in
the anterior or posterior chest, neck, jaw, or shoulder. Patient
usually presents with hypotension. The chest radiograph
is likely to show mediastinal widening, pleural effusion,
abnormal aortic contour, or cardiomegaly. Diagnosis can be
confirmed by echocardiography.

Psychiatric
Chest pain has been attributed to a psychiatric cause in
approximately 5–9% of cases and incidence may be rising in
recent years. A history of a preceding stressful event, such as
death or hospitalization in the family, family separation, or
school changes, has been reported. Other reported psychiatric
causes include anxiety disorders, depression and social phobia,
and sleep disturbances. Features of depression may be visible
and hyperventilation may be a presenting sign in such cases.

Clinical Pearl
• Young adolescent or children should be evaluated privately for
psychosomatic disorders and spending time alone with kids in
a friendly manner will mostly yield the results.

APPROACH
The primary goals in evaluation of a child with chest pain are to
rule out cardiac and other serious life-threatening causes and
to classify the origin of the pain. In cases in which the cause
remains unclear or if concerning features are identified, further
evaluation and sometimes, referral are warranted (Box 2).

Chapter 73: Approach to a Child with Chest Pain
The history should begin with the onset of pain, with the
knowledge that acute pain is more likely to be caused by an
identifiable organic cause. The pain that makes child awaken
from sleep has a higher likelihood of an organic cause. The
family should be asked about events that may have precipitated
the pain such as exercise, trauma, eating, potential foreign
body ingestion, or psychological stressors.
Characteristic pain patterns have been described with
certain conditions. Chest wall pain is often localized and
sharp, and exacerbated by deep breath/palpation. Pleural
or pulmonary pain may also be accentuated with inspiration
or cough, although pain is less likely to be well-localized
than musculoskeletal pain, and less likely to be reproduced
with palpation. Pleuritic pain is often sharp and superficial,
whereas pulmonary pain, such as that associated with
asthma, is more likely to be diffuse and deep. A description
of midsternal or precordial pain that worsens after eating or
when lying down may be esophageal. The classic description
of cardiac pain is that of pressure, crushing, or a squeezing
sensation that may radiate to the neck or arm. There is little
information on whether this classic description is typical
in pediatric cases. Pain that is relieved by sitting up and
leaning forward may be caused by pericarditis. The presence
of blood or other irritants in the peritoneal cavity may cause
referred chest or shoulder pain (Kehr’s sign). Psychogenic
pain is expected to be vague, poorly localized, varying in
location, and associated with other somatic complaints. Pain
associated with palpitations, dyspnea, or syncope should be
considered a possible indicator of cardiac disease, and pain
associated with exertion could be either cardiac or related to a
respiratory cause such as exercise induced asthma. A history
of fever is likely to be reported with pneumonia, but may also
be present with myocarditis, pericarditis, or pleural effusion.
A history of drooling or reluctance to swallow may be present
in a child with an esophageal foreign body. The presence of
joint pain or rash may suggest collagen vascular disease. The
patient and family should be asked about emotional stressors
or presence of anxiety or depression. Adolescents should be
asked about use of medications, especially oral contraceptives
and pills that have been associated with esophagitis such
as tetracycline. They should also be interviewed privately
and asked about use of illicit substances such as cocaine or
marijuana. Past medical history, such as Kawasaki disease,
asthma, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or connective tissue
disorders (Marfan syndrome etc.), should be ruled out. The
family history should focus on history of unexplained or
sudden death, serious underlying conditions, and whether
family members have a history of chest pain or heart disease.
The examination should include vital signs and an assessment
of the general appearance, noting level of alertness, color, and
presence of distress or anxiety.
Fever may suggest the presence of infectious or inflamma­
tory condition, and tachycardia or tachypnea suggests the
possibility of serious organic etiology.

ch-73.indd 341

The chest wall should be inspected for signs of trauma,
asym­metry, pectus carinatum or excavatum, or costosternal
swelling. Tenderness of the chest wall, costochondral or
costosternal junctions suggests a musculoskeletal etiology.
Auscultation of the lungs for crepts, wheezes, and decreased
breath sounds may suggest pneumonia, asthma, or pneumo­
thorax. Pneumomediastinum may cause sub­
cutaneous
emphysema, which can be detected by crepitus on palpation
of the supraclavicular area or neck.
The heart should be auscultated to identify the presence
of an irregular rhythm, murmur, rub, gallop, or muffled heart
sounds. The rub of pericardial effusion is best appreciated
when the patient is leaning forward. Patients with myocarditis
may have tachycardia, gallop rhythm, displaced point of
maximal impulse, or a murmur of mitral regurgitation. If
coarctation or aortic dissection is suspected, four-limb blood
pressures should be obtained.
Palpation of the abdomen may reveal epigastric tenderness
in patients with a gastrointestinal cause for their pain. The
skin and extremities should be examined for evidence of
trauma, chronic disease, or dysmorphology. Xanthomas on
the hands, elbows, knees, and buttocks are characteristic of
familial dyslipidemia. Markers for Marfan syndrome or other
connective tissue disorders should be searched.

INVESTIGATIONS
A chest radiograph should be obtained if there is unexplained
pain of acute onset, respiratory distress, abnormal pulmonary
or cardiac auscultation, fever, significant cough, history of
drooling or foreign body ingestion, or significant underlying
medical conditions.
A 12-lead ECG should be obtained if there is pain or
syncope with exertion, abnormal cardiac auscultation, a
clinical suspicion for myocarditis or pericarditis, or serious
underlying medical conditions that carry an increased risk of
cardiac disease.
Laboratory investigations are rarely necessary, but may
be useful when certain conditions are suspected. A complete
blood count may be obtained for suspected infectious causes
or in a patient with an underlying condition such as sickle
cell disease. In a patient with suspected cardiac ischemia or
myocarditis, cardiac enzymes may be useful; Holter monitor
if arrhythmia is suspected, exercise stress test or PFT for
unexplained exertional pain, and endoscopy for possible
gastrointestinal sources of pain.

CONCLUSION
As the differential diagnosis of chest pain is exhaustive
and many diagnoses are based on case reports rather than
prospective studies, it is difficult to develop evidence-based
guidelines for evaluation. The clinician should keep in mind the
broad differential diagnosis and order further investigations
when the history and physical examination are not conclusive.

Systemic Hypertension
Nurul Islam

INTRODUCTION
Hypertension is defined as average systolic blood pressure
(SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is ≥95th
percentile for gender, age, and height on more than or equal to
three 3 occasions.
As with adults, adolescent with blood pressure levels
≥120/80 mmHg should be considered prehypertensive.

GRADATION
•
•
•
•
•
•

Normotensive: both SBP and DBP less than 90th percentile
Prehypertension: when SBP/DBP more than 90th percentile
but less than 95th percentile
Stage I hypertension: SBP or DBP more than 95th percentile
but not 5 mmHg above the 99th percentile
Stage II hypertension: SBP or DBP is more than 5 mmHg
above the 99th percentile
White coat hypertension: when hypertension is noted
inside physicians office but not in normal surroundings
Marked hypertension: when present in surroundings.

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION
Hypertension
Therapeutic Lifestyle Modification
•
•
•
•

This is the first line of management of pediatric hyper­
tension and can be the sole modality of therapy in patients
diagnosed with pre-hypertension and stage I hypertension
It focuses on dietary management, increased physical
activity, stress reduction and avoidance of illicit drug and
tobacco use
Dietary management should include an age appropriate,
salt restricted diet with emphasis on weight loss in the
overweight or obese children
To have a better chance of success, the entire family should
adopt these lifestyle modifications.

Pharmacological Therapy
Please put in the table of guidelines of the international task
force on hypertension

Other Forms of Therapy
•

Bariatric surgery has a role in the treatment of hyper­
tension in the morbidly obese adult and might become
an option in the obese pediatric adolescent in the
future. A recent study (demonstrated an improvement in
metabolic syndrome including hypertension with up to
30% reduction in weight.
Renal nerve denervation is a therapeutic option in
adults with resistant hypertension, which refers to un­
controlled hypertension despite therapy with 3 or more anti­
hypertensives.

Pediatrician’s Perspective for
Postoperative Follow-up of a Child
Vikas Kohli, Mridul Agarwal

INTRODUCTION
Once a child gets operated, the surgical issues dominate
in the immediate post-operative. As the child recovers, the
surgical issues decrease and the cardiology issues come to the
forefront. Finally, as the child gets out of the ICU, the child’s
cardiology issues also become less dominating, the pediatric
issues related to feeding and infection (prevention) become
dominant.
Finally, on the long term, the pediatric issues like any
normal child remain in the forefront. The pediatrician’s
though need to be sure that there is no special issue because
of the cardiac surgery. So this chapter is devoted to this one
special aspect related to Pediatricians in long term follow up of
pediatric cardiac patients who have been operated.
Children after cardiac intervention procedure and cardiac
surgery are under care of their pediatrician. Common concerns
are discussed here.

GENERAL CARE

ch-75.indd 348

Mild cough with clear expectoration is common after
discharge for few days but cough with colored sputum, fever,
crepitation, or increase rate and/or work of breathing need
attention.

Feeding
Feeding and eating advice are no different from routine care.

WOUND CARE
Dressing
Children discharged after 5–7 days of surgery, do not have
closed dressing over sternotomy or thoracotomy wound and
do not requires active dressing.

Discharge
Any signs of redness, swelling, discharge, or opening of the
wound need to be reported to the cardiac unit.

General Hygiene and Isolation

Sutures

Parents are always counseled well regarding the hygienic
handling of the child. The re-emphasis on hand washing
and separation from other family members especially small
children, ensures the adherence.

The skin sutures used to close stenotomy and thoracotomy
wound are dissolvable and do not need removal. The sutures
used to close the drain sites need removal at first follow-up
visit.

Fever and Cough

Scar

Persistent fever of more than 100°F always need evaluation. If
cause of fever is obvious, like dehydration, upper respiratory
tract infections, gastroenteritis etc., it can be treated accordingly
or else further investigation in the form of white blood cell
count, C-reactive protein, chest X-ray, or urine examination
required localizing focus of infection.

The nature of skin scar after surgery depends on personal
propensity of scaring. The scar can be from thin white line
to large with keloid. Some children have lot of itching and
warmth over scar tissue; they can be advised calamine lotion
or coconut oil along with cotton clothing to decrease friction
and avoid direct sun exposure.

Chapter 75: Pediatrician’s Perspective for Postoperative Follow-up of a Child

PAIN RELIEF
Most of the children at the time of discharge are on round-theclock or SOS nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID;
mostly paracetamol). If the child complains of persistent pain
or the infant cries excessively, the NSAID combination can be
given.
Parents of infant and toddler are always counseled
regarding handling for the first two weeks after surgery. They
should avoid picking up baby under the arms, so that the
stretching of the wound should not cause pain. Re-emphasis of
the same is sometimes required.

INITIAL FOLLOW-UP
Most of the children are called for follow-up by 5–7 days. At this
visit, the child assessed for any sign of infection, adequacy of
oral intake, and the status of the wound. Stiches are removed,
if any present, and analgesics are discontinued and cardiac
medicines are adjusted.

FOLLOW-UPS
Corrective Surgeries
If no significant issues are noted during the initial follow-up,
further follow-up are planned after 3–6 months depending
on institutional policy. After that, usually annual follow-up
is required unless indicated. After adolescence, the followup usually decreased to two yearly and then to five yearly
thereafter.

While aspirin is stopped after 3–6 months, in the latter case, it
is continued throughout the duration of BT shunt.
Patients with artificial conduit and prosthetic valve remain
on anticoagulants (warfarin or nicoumalone) for lifetime. The
international normalized ratio should be only monitored and
adjusted by the cardiac unit, although bleeding complication
may need immediate attention.

VACCINATIONS
Rearranging the Vaccination Schedule
Factors that should be considered prior to immunization
before surgery:
• Diphtheria pertussis tetanus (DPT or DTaP) vaccine can
cause fever within 2–3 days of administration
• Rash and fever can be caused by measles or MMR (measles,
mumps, and rubella) vaccine as late as 2 weeks and by
varicella vaccine as late as 4 weeks
• Blood product administration can interfere with the
antibody response to live attenuated vaccine such as
measles, rubella, and varicella vaccines; therefore, it
should not be given within 2 weeks of cardiac surgery, else
repeat dose will be required later
• Oral polio vaccine should be avoided in hospital inpatients.

Clinical Pearls
Vaccination plan before surgery

• No vaccine in the last week before surgery
• No measles, rubella, or varicella vaccine in previous 2–4 weeks.

Palliative Surgeries
These include children who have undergone Blalock-Taussig
(BT) shunts or single ventricle palliation. These children
require different plan and close follow-up along with oxygen
saturation monitoring.

MEDICATIONS
Antibiotics
Children are rarely discharged on antibiotics for non­
bloodstream infection.

Diuretics and Vasodilators
After cardiac surgeries, lots of time children have diuretics
in their discharge medication. In absence of residual lesion,
diuretics are usually stopped by 4–6 weeks. Angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,
and β-blockers are given to some children for remodeling of
ventricles, usually stopped by 3–6 months.

Aspirin and International
Normalized Ratio Drugs
The patients of BT shunt and with the suture lines on side of
systemic circulation are on aspirin at the time of discharge.

ch-75.indd 349

Factors to be considered prior to immunization before
surgery
• According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s general recommendations on immuni­zation,
blood products can interfere with antibody response to
measles, rubella, and varicella vaccine for 3–6 months;
therefore, these vaccinations should be delayed at least by
3 months. Typhoid (Ty21a), yellow fever, live attenuated
influenza vaccine, zoster, and rotavirus vaccines may be
administered at any time before, concurrent with, or after
administration of any blood or immune product
• The chance of a vaccine associated fever complicating
postoperative management.

Clinical Pearls
Vaccination plan after surgery

• No vaccine for the first 4–6 weeks
• No measles, rubella, or varicella vaccine for 3 months.

Additional Vaccine
Children with corrected or uncorrected congenital heart
disease are at higher risk for lower respiratory tract infection,
and should be considered for pneumococcal and influenza

Chronic Diarrhea in Children
Less than 3 Years of Age
Moinak S Sarma, Surender K Yachha

DEFINITIONS

INTRODUCTION
This topic will address only the relatively common causes of
chronic diarrhea in children less than 3 years of age that are of
practical importance to the physician and also the emerging
entities that are often missed. Management of persistent
diarrhea is beyond the scope of this chapter.
Chronic diarrheas may arise from intestinal diseases (small
or large bowel), pancreatic, hepatobiliary, or systemic causes.
Their differentiation is elaborated in the next chapter “Chronic
Diarrhea in Children More than 3 Years of Age”.
Gastrointestinal and systemic causes of chronic diarrhea in
children less than 3 years of age are shown in boxes 1 and 2.

Before embarking upon the details of this topic, a few
clarifications regarding the terminologies used in diarrhea
need to be understood.
While describing diarrhea of a fairly large duration, the
terms “chronic”, “persistent”, “protracted”, and “intractable” are
loosely interchanged in literature and creates confusion in the
minds of the pediatricians.

Chronic Diarrhea
Chronic diarrhea is defined as an insidious onset diarrhea of
>2 weeks duration in children rarely leading to dehydration with

*Diarrhea in glycogen storage disease type 1b is due to opportunistic infections because of neutropenia and colitis due to inflammatory bowel disease
#Diarrhea in congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1b is due to protein-losing enteropathy
$Diarrhea in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 is due to bile acid malabsorption (deficiency of familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 protein in small bowel)
%Secondary lactose intolerance in persistent diarrhea may often have a prolonged course and mimic chronic diarrhea.

Chapter 76: Chronic Diarrhea in Children Less than 3 Years of Age
Box 2: Systemic causes of chronic diarrhea in children less
than 3 years of age
Common causes
• Urinary tract infection (most important)
• Nephrotic syndrome
• Septicemia
• Drugs: laxatives, antacids, antineoplastic
Uncommon causes
• Endocrinal causes, e.g., Addison’s disease, hypoparathyroidism
(autoimmune polyendocrinopathies)
• Neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma
• Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy

a wide range of underlying structural or chronic inflammatory
causes (acquired or congenital) causing malabsorptive or
maldigestive states.

Persistent Diarrhea
Persistent diarrhea is an episode of diarrhea of presumed
infectious etiology, which starts acutely but lasts for >14 days
commonly seen in children <2 years age resulting dehydration
and dyselectrolytemia with or without gain in weight or loss in
weight and not responding to usual therapy.

Protracted Diarrhea
Usually the term describes a prolonged diarrhea that
resolves despite its initial severity. However, this term is
often interchangeably used by several authors to encompass
chronic and persistent diarrheas. Most authors, at present,
restrict this term to those with prolonged diarrheas in
infancy of postinfectious origin, allergy-related, or due to
immunodeficiency.

Intractable Diarrhea
Prolonged diarrhea of more than 2 weeks occurring in infants
less than 3 months of age. The term is used to describe a
specific group of severe diarrheas of congenital nature that
persist despite bowel rest and often require total parenteral
nutrition for survival. This is a distinct entity and has been
briefly discussed below.

Secretory Diarrhea
Secretory diarrhea refers to a diarrhea with profound losses of
water and electrolytes in stools that persists despite bowel rest.
It occurs due to sodium pump failures at the enterocyte as a
result of toxins (e.g., Vibrio cholera).

Osmotic Diarrhea
Osmotic diarrhea is caused by damage to epithelium and
loss of brush border enzymes resulting in poor tolerance and
purging after an osmotic load and quiesence with bowel rest.
(eg: secondary lactose intolerance due to lactase enzyme
deficiency).

Ch-76.indd 353

BOVINE OR COW’S MILK PROTEIN ALLERGY
Bovine or cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) affects 2–5% of all
children in the West, with the highest prevalence during the
first year of life. In India, CMPA accounts for approximately
13% of all malabsorption cases in children less than 2 years
of age. Temporal association with introduction to animal or
formula milk (± products) is often noted. Wheeze, eczema, and
atopy (20–30%) with similar history in family members (10%)
may be associated. Nearly 50% children outgrow the allergy by
1 year and approximately 90% by 5 years of age. It is the most
common food allergy in small children who are top fed.
There are two kinds of reactions to cow’s milk:
1. Immediate [immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated]: it occurs
within minutes of milk intake and is characterized by
anaphylaxis-like features: vomiting, pallor, shock-like state,
urticaria, and swelling of lips seen in 10–20% cases
2. Delayed (T-cell, non-IgE mediated): it has an indolent
course and presents mainly with gastrointestinal (GI)
symptoms. This is more common in India seen in 80–90%
cases.

Symptoms
The most common presentation is diarrhea with blood and
mucus. Depending upon the site and extent of involvement,
the child may have small bowel, large bowel, or mixed type
diarrhea. Diarrhea and colitis is seen in 80% cases. They
may have iron deficiency anemia and failure to thrive rarely
as a clinical manifestation (especially those presenting as
predominant small bowel diarrhea).

Diagnosis
Gold standard for diagnosis is double blind placebo controlled
food challenge, but it is cumbersome to execute. A simpler
yet conclusive way in India is to document the disease by the
following methods:
• Flexible proctosigmoidoscopy: aphthous ulcers (80%
cases)
• Rectal biopsy: more than 6 eosinophils per high power field
+ eosinophilic cryptitis (97% cases)
• Symptom resolution after withdrawal of animal milk or
milk products (including formula feeds).
The new European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology,
Hepatology, and Nutrition, 2012 guidelines recommend the
following:
1. Non-IgE mediated CMPA: a response to a trial of elimination
diet for 2–4 weeks, followed by relapse of symptoms in next
2 weeks of oral challenge with cow’s milk protein diagnoses
the condition without any biopsy. Thereafter a therapeutic
elimination diet is given
2. IgE mediated disease: CMP-specific IgE and skin prick
tests. However these tests are not reliable in India due to
lack of standarised laboratories.
The above recommendations reserve rectal biopsy and
histopathology in scenarios of diagnostic dilemma, compli­
cated disease and non-response to elimination diet

353

Section 10: Gastroenterology

Treatment
All animal milk/milk products have to be eliminated
from the diet. Breast milk should be continued. Calcium
supplementation is mandatory as milk that has been withdrawn
is a rich source of calcium. Explaining the natural history of the
disease to parents, counseling, vigilance, and compliance are
the cornerstones.

Child less than 4 Months of Age
In Western countries, an exclusive extensively hydrolyzed
formulation (EHF) is prescribed. In case of nonresponse to EHF,
an elemental (amino acid formula) is used. Hypoallergenic
formulae (EHF or elemental formulae) are not marketed in
India. Hence, we are compelled to use soy formulae (not casein
based). Soy formulations in infants less than 6 months of age
are not recommended in the West (the European Society of
Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the

American Academy of Pediatrics). Concomitant soy allergy is
seen in 10–15% due to allergens (conglycinin and glycinin).
Other problems with soy are high amounts of phytoestrogens
that may interfere with neuroendocrine functions, high
phytates that limit zinc, iodine, and iron absorption, and,
manufacturing related aluminum contamination. Hence,
there is a dire need to urge the marketing of hypoallergenic
formulae in India.

Child more than 4 Months of Age
Formula feeds, animal milk, and milk products are stopped.
Children more than 4 months of age are at an appropriate
age for weaning and hence, dietary supplementation with
cereals and pulses (region specific) is started. Rice gruel which
is relatively hypoallergenic may be tried. If the child is more
than 6 months of age, then, soy formulae can be permitted.
Algorithm 1 outlines the for management of CMPA.

an academic setting, biopsy is repeated twice after initial milk withdrawal. First assessment is at 6–8 weeks as shown above to confirm normalization of histology.
Second assessment is at 48 hours of reintroduction of milk to decide wether it is safe to continue milk or not by (a) clinical symptoms and (b) histologic changes.
Milk-free diet is continued if symptoms or histological changes reappear. If histology is normal and symptoms do not reappear, then, child can be continued on milk.
However, in practical setting, both the repeat biopsies are not feasible due to the cumbersome process.
*Reintroduction of milk: child is given 10 mL/kg cow’s milk (0.3 g/kg milk protein) initially and watched for 1 h. If there are no adverse events, then, 20 mL/kg cow’s
milk is given again watched for another 1 h. If there are no symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting, etc., then, normal milk feeding is continued.

Chapter 76: Chronic Diarrhea in Children Less than 3 Years of Age

SECONDARY LACTOSE INTOLERANCE
This condition is commonly seen as a cause of persistent
diarrhea (secondary to viral gastroenteritis). However,
it may be associated with underlying chronic diarrhea
(celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, giardiasis) due to villous
atrophy and secondary deficiency of brush border enzymes
(including lactase). It manifests as explosive (gaseous
and noisy) stools and perianal excoriation that resolves
on lactose-free diet. Persistent diarrhea causes damage to
enterocyte and causes deficiency of the lactase enzyme
located at the top of brush border epthelium. Hence lactose
is not broken down to glucose and galactose. Unabsorbed
dietary lactose delivered to colon is converted to hydrogen
and lactic acid by colonic bacteria. Lactic acid results in
decreased stool pH, hydrogen gives explosive stool and
unabsorbed lactose gives positive reducing substances if
tested. Lactose increased the osmolality (osmotic diarrhea).
Fungal infection of the perineum in fungal diarrhea may
mimic secondary lactose intolerance. In fungal infections,
there are curdy white, satellite lesions and extension into the
genitalia and groin flexures.
Confirmation is not required if stools are explosive and
perianal area is excoriated. In doubtful cases, the diagnosis is
confirmed by stool pH less than 6.0 and reducing substances
more than 0.5%. Withdrawal of lactose containing milk for 3
weeks is the mainstay of treatment. Perianal area is managed
by nursing on soft cloth, avoiding diapers, maintaining proper
hygiene, and applying local emollients (coconut oil, liquid
paraffin zinc oxide).

IMMUNODEFICIENCY STATES
Common presenting features and brief management of
immuno­deficiency has been discussed in detail in the next
chapter. Additionally, there are few more immunodeficiency
states with GI manifestations that are seen in younger
children.

X-linked Agammaglobulinemia
•
•
•
•

Onset after 6 months of age
Chronic rotavirus infection
Absent tonsils
Panhypogammaglobulinemia + B cells less than 1%.
Normal T cells.

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
•
•
•
•

Onset in first few months
Cytomegalovirus colitis and mucocutaneous candidiasis
Absent tonsils
Leukopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, absent T cells ±
B cells
In both the groups, the children die by 1–2 years of
age, if untreated. Treatment is specific; antimicrobials and
intravenous immunoglobulin 400–600 mg/kg to tide over
crisis. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation is curative.

NONSPECIFIC OR TODDLER’S DIARRHEA
This is a diagnosis of exclusion and contributes to 16% of all
chronic diarrheas in preschool children. It is seen usually in
thriving children of 6–20 months of age and spontaneously
resolves by 3 years of age in majority. The diarrhea worsens
with high osmolar feeds, e.g., juices, nectar fruits (grapes,
melons, etc.). Occasionally, undigested food particles are seen
in stool. No nocturnal symptoms or red flags are associated.
Family history of irritable bowel syndrome may be present.
Normal anthropometry and absence of anemia differentiate
this condition from common conditions like celiac disease
and CMPA. Treatment consists of reassurance, high fat
(2 g/kg butter), and high fiber diet with reduced intake of
juices. Antimotility agents should not be prescribed.
Celiac disease, and intestinal lymphangiectasia are
discussed in detail in next chapter.

These are very rare causes of chronic diarrhea that are of
congenital nature, severe in their course, often dependent on
parenteral nutrition and most requiring small bowel transplant.

Setting to Suspect Intractable
Diarrhea of Infancy
•

Dehydrating diarrhea in an infant beginning in neonatal
period or less than 3 months of age and
• Prolongation of diarrhea beyond 2 weeks despite extensive
hospital therapy with one or more of the following:
{{ At least 3 negative stool cultures for bacterial pathogen
{{ Family history of consanguinity, sibling death, or
polyhydramnios
{{ Associated dysmorphism or systemic features
{{ Common conditions like food protein allergy, intestinal
lymphangiectasia, antibiotic associated diarrhea ruled

{{ No response to empirical elemental diet.
Common causes of intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI)
with their salient features are shown in table 1. Brief approach
to IDI is shown in algorithm 2.
Except congenital alactasia which has favorable prognosis
with absolute restriction of lactose in diet, the rest of the
disorders have no definitive treatment; often require life-long
parenteral nutrition or small bowel transplant. Intractable
diarrhea of infancy patients patients have very high mortality.

Chronic Diarrhea in
Children More than 3 Years of Age
Surender K Yachha, Moinak S Sarma

INTRODUCTION

•

Chronic diarrhea is defined as an insidious onset diarrhea of
more than 2–3 weeks duration in children. Causes of chronic
diarrhea in older children (>3 years) and adolescents are
distinctly different from those in younger age.

APPROACH TO CHRONIC DIARRHEA
Approach to chronic diarrhea should be considered with the
following points in mind:
• Small or large bowel type of diarrhea: features in history
and examination that help in differentiating small from
large bowel diarrhea shown in table 1. To summarize,
large volume diarrhea without blood and mucus suggests
“small bowel type” and small volume stools with blood and
mucus suggests “large bowel type” of diarrhea.

Gastrointestinal (GI) versus systemic causes: commonly,
diarrhea is of intestinal origin and sometimes due to
pancreatic etiology, and rarely, hepatobiliary causes.
Cholestasis due to biliary obstruction or intrahepatic
cause can cause diarrhea due to fat malabsorption as a
result of deficiency of bile. Diarrhea may be caused due to
liver diseases having genetic or metabolic defects mostly
prevalent among young children. Pruritus, fat soluble
vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and calcium malabsorption
is commonly associated with hepatobiliary diseases.
Maldigestion due to deficiency of pancreatic enzymes
results in clinical steatorrhea in cystic fibrosis, ShwachmanDiamond syndrome (cyclical neutropenia and skeletal
dysplasia), or chronic pancreatitis. Diarrhea may also be a
systemic manifestation of other conditions like nephrotic
syndrome, sepsis, or collagen vascular disorders. Box 1
enumerates the common and uncommon causes of
diarrhea in children more than 3 years of age.

Box 1: Causes according to age of onset (in order of priority)
• Common causes
{{ Celiac disease
{{ Parasites: giardiasis and others
{{ Lymphangiectasia
{{ Gastrointestinal tuberculosis
{{ Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease; ulcerative
colitis* unclassified IBD)
{{ Immunodeficiency syndromes
{{ Pancreatic insufficiency
{{ Bacterial overgrowth syndrome (diagnosis of exclusion) in
a non-surgical setting

• Uncommon causes
{{ Tropical sprue
{{ Immune proliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID)
{{ Anatomical causes (malrotation of gut)
{{ Intestinal fistulae (duodenocolic commonest)
{{ Late-lactose intolerance (very rare)
{{ Autoimmune enteropathy
{{ Systemic causes:

*Ulcerative colitis presents as bloody diarrhea. Crohn’s disease may present either as colitis or small bowel diarrhea or both.
#
Diarrhea in nephrotic syndrome is presumed to be due to bowel wall edema (hypoalbuminemia).
$
Secondary lymphangiectasia due to chronic back pressure is the cause of diarrhea in constrictive pericarditis, can also occur due to other causes.

WHAT SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR IN HISTORY?
•
•
•
•

Details of duration of symptoms, nature, frequency and
consistency of stools, and presence of blood/mucus/clinical
steatorrhea (stool floating in water, greasy oily droplets)
Age of onset, dietary details, i.e., introduction of wheat/
wheat products and their relationship with onset of
diarrhea. Relationship with milk intake and quantity
Family history of atopy (food allergy, asthma, or allergic
rhinitis), celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
or cystic fibrosis
History of abdominal surgery, systemic disease, features of
intestinal obstruction, pedal edema, anasarca, recurrent
infections at multiple sites, previous blood transfusion,
and coexisting medical problems which predispose the
child to diarrhea like congenital immuno­
deficiency,
diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, cystic fibrosis, etc.

Abdominal examination: abdominal distention, localized
or generalized tenderness, masses, hepatosplenomegaly,
and ascites.

The common etiologies are elaborated below. Algorithm 1
shows an approach to chronic diarrhea more than 3 years of
age (major etiologies).

CELIAC DISEASE
It is an enteropathy caused by permanent sensitivity to gluten
in genetically susceptible subjects. It is the most common
cause of chronic diarrhea in children over 2 years of age in
North India. Boxes 2 and 3 summarize the diagnosis and
management of the same.

Intestinal Lymphangiectasia
It is characterized by ectasia of the bowel lymphatic system,
which on rupture causes leakage of lymph in the bowel. Box 4
summarizes the diagnosis and management of the same.

Immunodeficiency
Both congenital and acquired immunodeficiency can cause
chronic diarrhea. It should be suspected if there is history
of recurrent infections at multiple sites (chest/GI/skin) and
wasting. The common immunodeficiency conditions in
children more than 3 years of age presenting with diarrhea
are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, selective
immunoglobulin A deficiency, common variable immuno­
deficiency, and chronic granulo­
matous disease. Boxes 5
and 6 summarize the diagnosis and management of the same.
Diarrhea is either due to opportunistic enteric infections or
due to bacterial overgrowth.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflamma­tory
disease of the GI tract and is of two main types: (1) Crohn’s
disease (CD) and (2) ulcerative colitis (UC). In approximately
10% cases, the findings are nonspecific and subjects cannot

Note:*
• Selective IgA deficiency: recurrent giardiasis
• IgA anti-tTG positive + villous atropy + other biopsy changes (Box 2): celiac disease
• IgA anti-tTG negative + low IgA level + villous atropy + other biopsy changes (Box 2): celiac disease
• Dilated lacteals on duodenal biopsies: intestinal lymphangiectasia (Box 4 for other supportive features)
• Low IgA, IgM, and IgG ± villous atropy ± paucity of plasma cells on duodenal biopsies: immunodeficieny workup as shown in Box 5.

be classified into one of the above two groups. These cases
are labeled as IBD unclassified. Nearly 25% of all IBD patients
present in the pediatric age group. Worldwide, the incidence of
IBD is increasing in children with increase in recent reports of
both UC and CD from India. The average age of presentation
in children is nearly 10–11 years. Genetics is a very important
risk factor for IBD and up to 30% patients may have an affected
family member with IBD. Box 7 summarizes the disease
distribution of UC and CD.

Clinical Features
360

Children with CD present with abdominal pain, diarrhea
(with or without blood), and constitutional symptoms
(fever, anorexia, growth failure). In contrast, children with UC
present with only recurrent or prolonged episodes of bloody

Ch-77.indd 360

diarrhea, commonly without constitutional symptoms. Table 2
summarizes the clinical, histologic, and endoscopic differences
between UC and CD.
Extraintestinal manifestations are seen in 25–30% children
with IBD. They can precede, follow, or occur concurrently
with the intestinal disease and may be related or unrelated to
the activity of the intestinal disease. Arthralgia/arthritis is the
most common manifestation seen in 15–17% cases. Uveitis,
erythema nodosum and sclerosing cholangitis are the other
manifestations.

Diagnosis
The initial evaluation of a child with suspected IBD includes
a detailed clinical, family, and treatment history. Also, a
complete examination with growth charting, perianal and

• Presentation
{{ Onset after weaning when gluten is introduced
{{ Small bowel diarrhea, failure to thrive, short stature, and
gaseous abdominal distension
{{ Anemia, rickets, and multivitamin deficiencies
• Workup: mandatory in India
{{ Positive serology: IgA anti-tTG (preferred) or IgA anti-EMA
{{ Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: scalloping ± reduced
number of duodenal folds, mosaic pattern, cobblestoning of
duodenal mucosa (not specific)
{{ Endoscopic duodenal biopsy:*
–– Partial to total villous atrophy
–– Hyperplastic crypts
–– Increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (>30/100

• Clinical picture consistent with celiac disease
• Changes in intestinal biopsy as described above (+ serology*)
• Unequivocal response to GFD within 12 weeks of initiation of GFD

endomysial antibody; DGP, deamidated gliadin peptide; HLA, human
leukocyte antigen.
*Between 4–6 biopsies should be obtained (at least 4 from second part of
duodenum and one from first part). Biopsies should be directly immersed in
formalin solution for best orientation under microscope.

rectal examination for fistulae, tags, and fissures to be done.
Laboratory tests may reveal anemia and thrombocytosis
(67%), low albumin, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) and C-reactive protein in 40–60% cases. Hence, IBD
must be suspected in any child presenting with consti­tutional
symptoms, chronic large bowel diarrhea (± blood), and
thrombocytosis. Table 3 summarizes the diagnostic modalities
available for IBD.

Treatment
The goal of treatment is to control inflammation, mucosal
healing, improve growth, and ensure a good quality of life with
the least toxic therapeutic regimen. Ensuring proper nutrition
with caloric supplementation (~120% of recommended dietary
allowances) is a necessity for children with IBD. Calcium and
vitamin D supplementation should be given as these children
are at an increased risk of osteoporosis. As IBD is a chronic
disease with remissions and exacerbations, proper counseling
of both, patient and family, at diagnosis is essential. The main
drugs used for IBD are listed in the tables 4 and 5. Additionally,
for perianal fistulizing CD, antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 20 mg/kg,
metronidazole 10–20 mg/kg, azithromycin 10 mg/kg, or rifaximin
10–30 mg/kg) for 4–6 weeks have shown good short-term
response.

New ESPGHAN 2012 guidelines for diagnosis:
• Small bowel biopsy may be omitted when all three following
tests are fulfilled: anti-tTG ≥10 times upper limit, anti-EMA
positive and HLA DQ 2/8 positive (details in original article)
• However, due to certain limitations in India (cost, unreliability
of laboratory reports, and overlap with other chronic diarrheal
diseases), the above guideline is difficult to implement currently.
Hence, small bowel biopsy is still recommended for diagnosis
(personal view).
Treatment:
• GFD (wheat and barley) should never be started without a
positive histology
• Lifelong GFD, vigilance, and counseling. Region-specific dietary
chart
• Hematinics, folic acid, and multivitamin supplementation for
3 months
• Response to GFD should be assessed at 8–12 weeks to label the
patient having celiac disease as per diagnostic criteria
• At follow-up: compliance with repeated reinforcement of GFD,
symptomatic, anthropometric, and laboratory (hemoglobin,
albumin, and transaminases) normalization to be assessed
ESPGHAN, European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology,
and Nutrition; GFD, gluten-free diet; EMA, endomysial antibody; tTG, tissue
transglutaminase; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; IgA, immunoglobulin A.
*In India positive serology (IgA-tTG) should be demonstrated as there are
other conditions that may result in villous atrophy mimicking celiac disease

Box 4: Features and management of intestinal lymphangiectasia
Presentation:
• Small bowel diarrhea with anasarca ± lymphedema of peripheries
• Abdominal or thoracic chylous effusions may be associated
• Usually, absence of anemia and rickets (in contrast to celiac
disease)
• Hypocalcemic tetany
Diagnosis:
• Panhypoproteinemia, low immunoglobulins, hypocalcemia, and
lymphopenia
• Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: white patches in duo­denum
(snow-flake appearance), better appreciated after overnight fat
(butter) loading 2 g/kg
• Small bowel biopsy: dilated lacteals in the villi
Treatment:
• Diet: low fat, high medium chain triglyceride with high protein
(2–4 g/kg)
• Medium chain triglycerides should be 85% of total fat intake
• Calcium supplementation
• Intravenous albumin (1 g/kg) during acute exacerbations
• In refractory cases: subcutaneous octreotide 15–20 µg daily
twice or 10–20 µg depot preparation once in 4 weeks
• Resection if localized segment of small bowel is involved by
identifying the segment by 99Tc albumin scintigraphy

pediatric UC.

Diagnosis
•

ABDOMINAL TUBERCULOSIS
High index of suspicion for abdominal tuberculosis is to be
considered in any child with:
• Constitutional symptoms (prolonged fever, anorexia, and
weight loss) + any of the features in table 6
• Contact with open case of tuberculosis (adult)
• Mantoux test positivity (≥5 mm in HIV and ≥10 mm in
non-HIV patients irrespective of age at 48–72 hours of
tuberculin injection)
• Contributory laboratory features: high ESR, lymphocytosis.

Ch-77.indd 363

•
•

Definitive: demonstration of acid fast bacilli (fine needle
aspiration cytology from lymph nodes, ascitic fluid,
endoscopic biopsies) on Ziehl‒Neelson (ZN) staining
or culture (BACTEC or Lowenstein-Jensen media). If
adequate tissue is sampled and processed, a definitive
diagnosis is achievable in up to 64% of pediatric cases
Supportive: tubercular granuloma with caseation in the
biopsies (endoscopic/peritoneal/liver)
In the absence of above features, a probable diagnosis of
abdominal tuberculosis is made when suggestive clinical
features and response to antitubercular therapy (ATT)
without relapse after completion of therapy is observed

Peritoneum

• Dry: adhesive intestinal obstruction lump (cocoon abdomen)
• Wet: exudative ± loculated ascites
• “Doughy” feel of abdomen

• Peritoneoscopy/laparoscopy: peritoneal tubercules
• Ascitic fluid: lymphocytosis with high adenosine
deaminase

Lymph nodes

• Lump (lymph nodal mass)

• Fine needle aspiration from necrotic, enlarged
(>10 mm) and/or calcified, conglomerate lymph nodes

Gastrointestinal • Ulcerative: abdominal pain, GI bleed, anemia
tract (luminal)
• Hypertrophic: Intestinal obstruction
• Ulcerohypertrophic: Combination of above 18–64% present
as chronic diarrhea or colitis

• Features on colonoscopy*
• Colonic and ileal biopsies by endoscopy#
• Laparotomy and surgical biopsy of small bowel

Hepatic

• Systemic symptoms with hepatomegaly
• Non-resolving liver abscess

• Raised serum alkaline phosphatase
• Multiple hypodense ± calcified foci in liver

Combination

• Nodal ± peritoneal ± GI

• Tissue sampling and workup as above

Disseminated

• Abdominal + other organs (lungs, peripheral LN, bone
marrow)

*Ab.TB is a close differential of Crohn’s disease. Some major endoscopic features (though not discriminatory) may favor Ab.TB:
• Segmental involvement (as compared to skip areas in CD)
• Deep circular transverse ulcers (as compared to deep linear serpiginous ulcers in CD)
• Short colonic strictures (as compared to multiple long strictures in CD).
#Due to significant overlap between the two diseases, all biopsy specimens should be simultaneously sent for histopathology, ZN staining, TB culture and TB-PCR
(polymerase chain reaction). Culture positivity may be seen despite initial ZN stain negativity. Tissue TB-PCR (nested or real time) has high specificity (98%) but lower
sensitivity (68–75%).

Ch-77.indd 364

Due to emergence of multidrug resistance tuberculosis
(MDR-TB) and delay in obtaining culture sensitivity, World
Health Organization recommends “Line Probe Assay”
from all acid fast bacilli positive tissue samples (ZN stain or
culture). Line probe assay provides drug sensitivity within
6 hours and differentiates Mycobacterium tuberculosis
from nontubercular Mycobacteria.

Treatment
Antitubercular drugs are the mainstay of treatment of
abdominal tuberculosis as per the current pediatric guidelines
in India. Surgery is indicated if there is bowel perforation,
obstruction, or massive hemorrhage. It is important to
differentiate intestinal tuberculosis from Crohn’s disease

11/21/2016 9:53:06 AM

Chapter 77: Chronic Diarrhea in Children More than 3 Years of Age
as they mimic each other in clinical presentation but have
different treatment. One should also suspect MDR-TB in
patients with a definite diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis
but a poor response to standard ATT. Multidrug resistance
tuberculosis presents mostly as refractory lymph nodal
masses in the abdomen with close differential diagnosis of
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Clinical Pearls
• Small bowel diarrhea
{{ Small bowel diarrhea + anemia and rickets: think of celiac
disease
{{ Small bowel diarrhea + predominant edema without
anemia: think of intestinal lymphangiectasia
{{ Small bowel diarrhea + recurrent infections: think of
immuno­deficiency
{{ Abdominal tuberculosis rarely presents as small bowel
diarrhea
{{ In celiac disease, do not start gluten-free diet without
confirmation of diagnosis (serology + histopathology)
• Large bowel diarrhea
{{ Large bowel diarrhea in an older child: think of inflammatory
bowel disease and tuberculosis
{{ Workup for both should be sent together as they may mimic
each other
{{ Necrotic or calcified lymph node in chest or abdomen and
exudative ascites is specific for tuberculosis
{{ Attempt to obtain tissue diagnosis in abdominal tuberculosis
before starting antitubercular therapy.

Key points

Differentiating small from large bowel diarrhea, mal­
absorption from maldigestion clinically provides a clue to
diagnosis

Common causes of chronic small bowel diarrhea in children
above 3 years of age are celiac disease (in North India),
giardiasis, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and immunodeficiency

Celiac disease and lymphangiectasia require life-time
therapy whereas giardiasis and opportunistic infections in

Antitubercular therapy is the mainstay of therapy in
abdominal tuberculosis. Multidrug resistance tuberculosis
(MDR-TB) should be considered if there is nonresponse and

Approach to Upper
Gastrointestinal Bleed in Children
Anshu Srivastava

INTRODUCTION
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a commonly
encountered problem in children that usually manifests
as hematemesis or melena. The incidence in pediatric
intensive care unit (ICU) is reported to vary from 6 to 25% and
approximately 5% of UGI endoscopies in children are done
for UGIB. Although less than 1% of UGIB is life threatening,
medical attention is sought early in majority due to its alarming
nature and this helps in prompt diagnosis and management.
Children tolerate UGIB better than adults due to absence of
systemic comorbidities but are at greater risk of developing
shock due to their smaller blood volumes. Approach to a child
with UGIB is discussed in this chapter.

DEFINITIONS
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: this denotes bleeding from
a site in the gastrointestinal tract above the ligament of Trietz
(esophagus to duodenojejunal flexure).
The common terms used to describe UGIB are as follows:
• Hematemesis is presence of bright red or altered coffeeground blood in vomiting
• Melena is passage of black, tarry, sticky stools with an
offensive smell and suggests an UGI or small bowel site of
bleeding
• Hematochezia is passage of bright red blood in stools and
is usually seen with bleeding in colon but very brisk UGIB
with fast gut transit may also present with hematochezia
• Hemobilia refers to bleeding from the biliary tree and
hemosuccus pancreaticus to bleeding from the pancreas.
In both these conditions, blood enters the duodenum
from the common bile duct or pancreatic duct through the
ampulla of vater.
Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB): bleeding from
gastrointestinal tract that persists or recurs without any obvious

etiology after a diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy and
colonoscopy. It accounts for ~5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds
and is classified into two types:
1. Occult OGIB: presents as stool occult blood positivity and
iron deficiency anemia
2. Overt OGIB: presents as visible blood in stool and/or
vomitus.
Approach: a detailed history, followed by physical examination,
is helpful in determining the most probable cause of UGIB.
Management includes simultaneous stabili­
zation of child
and determination of etiology of UGIB, followed by definitive
therapy (Algorithm 1).
• The first question is if the hematemesis and/or melena is
due to blood or not, especially in an otherwise healthy child
{{ The food items looking like blood in vomitus are shown
in box 1
{{ An Apt-Downey test is used to differentiate the
swallowed maternal blood from hematemesis in a
neonate
{{ Box 2 shows ingested items which may present as
melena. The differentiation is made by performing a
guaiac (detects “heme” component of hemoglobin)
or fecal immunochemical testing (detects “globin”
component of hemoglobin) in stool
• The next step is to differentiate UGIB from epistaxis,
oropharyngeal bleeding, and hemoptysis:
{{ History of chronic cough and passage of bright red
blood associated with sputum indicates toward
hemoptysis
{{ Nose and oropharynx should be examined to rule out
other sites of bleed
{{ It is important not to confuse onset of menarche with
melena
{{ History of bleeding from multiple sites points
toward systemic causes like thrombocytopenia and
coagulopathy.

EVL, endoscopic variceal ligation; EST, endoscopic sclerotherapy; SB, Sangstaken Blakemore; TIPS, transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt; PPI, proton pump inhibitors.

Box 1: Causes of red colored vomitus (other than upper
gastrointestinal bleeding)
• Food items containing red food coloring (jelly, candies, Kool aid,
juices)
• Tomatoes, strawberries, beetroot, cranberries

The important causes of UGIB in children are given in
table 1 and clues in history and physical examination toward
the likely cause are shown in table 2.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the investigation of
choice both for diagnosing the cause and providing therapy.
It should preferably be done under general anesthesia or
conscious sedation with airway protection to avoid aspiration
and only after the patient is hemodynamically stable. The
yield of UGI endoscopy is best if it is done within 24 hours
of onset of UGIB. A complete examination of esophagus,
stomach, and duodenum with retroflexion to inspect the
fundus and gastroesophageal junction is essential (Figs 1–3).
Biopsy should always be taken to look for helicobacter pylori
in patients with gastric/duodenal ulcers.

MANAGEMENT
The management approach is as shown in algorithm 1.
Assessment of severity of bleed and hemodynamic status
should be done by measurement and monitoring of heart rate,
blood pressure, postural change in blood pressure and heart
rate, pulse volume, capillary refill time, oxygen saturation
(pulse oxymetry), and urine output.
Minor bleed has no effect on heart rate and blood pressure,
moderate bleed is associated with postural hypotension and
tachycardia whereas massive bleed is associated with shock
(defined in children as tachycardia with signs of decreased
organ or peripheral perfusion).
Presence of blood on nasogastric (NG) tube aspiration
confirms an UGI source of bleeding. However, absence of
blood on NG aspiration does not rule out an UGIB (duodenal
source or intermittent bleeding from stomach/esophagus). A
serum urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio above 30 also points
toward an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding.

varices

INVESTIGATIONS
Investigations are aimed at establishing the site, severity, and
cause of bleeding. Hematocrit (Hct) should be monitored
frequently to assess severity of blood loss as the hemoglobin
falls only after a few hours, after hemodilution. A complete
hemogram including platelet count, coagulation profile (PT/
APTT), liver function tests, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, and
cross matching should be done in all patients at admission.

CHAPTER 78: Approach to Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed in Children
General supportive measures: a good venous access, intake
output monitoring, oxygen supplementation (if required), and
charting of vitals are mandatory. Blood transfusion should be
given to achieve hemoglobin of 7–8 g/dL. Coagulopathy and
thrombocytopenia are corrected by appropriate component
therapy (plasma, platelets, etc.) if required. Short-term
antibiotic prophylaxis (third generation cephalosporin for 7
days), should be given to children with cirrhosis and variceal
bleed as it reduces bacterial infection, variceal rebleeding
and death.
Specific treatment: the choice of treatment depends upon
the patient’s condition, available facilities, and expertise of
the personnel. Specific treatment can be broadly divided into
management of variceal and nonvariceal bleed.

Variceal Bleeding
Fig. 3: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showing duodenal ulcer
without signs of active bleeding

The other investigations which help in reaching a diagnosis
are discussed below.
Ultrasonography with Doppler provides information about
portal vein, hepatic veins, inferior vena cava, presence of
collaterals, etc. and helps in diagnosis of portal hypertension
[extra hepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) and chronic
liver disease].
Contrast enhanced computed tomography scan: this is
useful in evaluation of patients with mass lesions, suspected
hemobilia or hemosuccus pancreaticus. Selective angiography
of celiac trunk is required in patients where a vascular lesion
like pseudoaneurysm is suspected. Therapy with coil/gel
embolization can be done at the time of angiography.
Nuclear scintigraphy (technetium 99m labeled
pertechnetate scan) is helpful in children suspected to have
duplication cyst of proximal gastrointestinal tract.
Enteroscopy (single/double balloon) is required in some
cases for evaluation of lesions in distal duodenum (third and
fourth part) if the etiology cannot be determined on standard
UGI endoscopy.

Clinical Pearls
• Hematocrit should be monitored to assess severity of bleeding
as hemoglobin falls later, after hemodilution.
• The yield of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is maximum if done within
24 hours of onset of bleed.

TREATMENT
The treatment of a child with UGIB depends on the severity of
bleeding and has two main arms.

In a child with portal hypertension, esophageal varices are
the most common cause of UGIB (Fig. 1). Gastric varices,
congestive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can
also present with hematemesis.
Somatostatin and octreotide: these drugs decrease the
splanchnic and azygous blood flow, thus reducing the portal
pressure. Somatostatin and octreotide both are equally
effective. Limited studies in children have shown control
of bleeding in 64–71% children. Overall, this therapy is well
tolerated with mild side effects like hyperglycemia, abdominal
discomfort, nausea, and diarrhea which often resolve
spontaneously. Infusion should be given for at least 24–48
hours after the bleeding has stopped to prevent recurrence and
infusion should not be stopped abruptly. The doses are shown
in table 3. Vasopressin, terlipressin, and nitroglycerine are
other drugs useful in management of variceal bleed but data
are largely limited to adults.

Clinical Pearls
• In patients with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, transfusion
should be given to achieve a hemoglobin of 7–8 g/dL
• Antibiotic should be given to all patients with chronic liver
disease and variceal bleeding.

Endoscopic Therapy
Esophageal varices: endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and
endoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) are the two main methods.
The varices are inspected and their location, size, and extent
are documented with a fiber-optic endoscope. In EST, 2–3 mL
of sclerosant (1% ethoxysclerol) is injected into each variceal
column. Endoscopic variceal ligation is done with a device
called multiple band ligator. The variceal column is sucked into
a cylinder attached at the tip of the endoscope and the band is
deployed by pulling the trip wire around the varix. Both EST
and EVL have a 90–100% efficacy in controlling acute bleeding.
The major complications include esophageal ulceration,
stricture esophagus and rarely perforation.

max 5 μg/kg/h

Somatostatin* • 250 μg bolus and then 250 μg/h infusion in
adults
Terlipressin*

• 2 mg every 4 h IV for 24–48 h, then 1 mg every
4 h in adults

PO, per os; IV, intravenous.

Endoscopic variceal ligation is preferred over EST due to
lesser side effects and quicker eradication with less number of
sessions. However, EVL cannot be done in children less than
2–3 years due to technical reasons and in them EST is the only
option.
Gastric varices: endoscopic injection of tissue adhesive glue,
i.e., N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate or isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate is
used for gastric varices (Fig. 2). These agents harden within
20 seconds of contact with blood, and lead to a more rapid
control of active bleeding. Only a small volume (0.5–1 mL) of
glue is injected at a time and multiple injections can be done
in a single session. Appropriate care must be taken to avoid
damage to the endoscope during glue injection. The role of
Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration in the
management of acute gastric varices bleeding is promising but
merits further evaluation.

370

Tamponade of varices: this is required only when the
endoscopic and pharmacologic measures have failed.
Sangstaken‒Blakemore tube (SBT) is a triple lumen tube with
connection to an esophageal balloon, a gastric balloon and
one perforated distal end which helps in aspiration of the
stomach contents. The SBT is relatively cheap, requires little
skill vis-à-vis EST and has efficacy of above 75% in controlling
acute variceal bleeding. Both pediatric and adult size SBTs are
available. The tube is passed through the nose and allowed to
reach the stomach. Thereafter, the gastric balloon is inflated

with 75–150 mL of air depending on the size of the patient
(stomach) and the tube is gently pulled outward so that it sits
snugly against the fundus and gastroesophageal junction.
A plain X-ray of the abdomen is done to check the proper
placement of gastric balloon in the stomach. If the bleeding
continues after inflation of gastric balloon then the esophageal
balloon is inflated. Esophageal necrosis and perforation,
pulmonary aspiration and rebleeding on deflation of balloon
are important complications. The esophageal balloon should
be deflated after 12–24 hours, and in case of continued bleeding
it can be reinflated. However, it should be remembered that
SBT is a temporary treatment and efforts should be done to
arrange for endoscopic therapy at the earliest.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): it is
indicated in patients where the variceal bleeding cannot be
controlled by medical and endoscopic measures. The TIPS can
be done in cirrhotic patients with a patent splenoportal axis.
It is not feasible in patients with EHPVO due to thrombosed
portal vein. It involves insertion of a multipurpose catheter
through the jugular vein and superior vena cava. The catheter
is thereafter passed via hepatic vein into a branch of portal vein
through the hepatic parenchyma. The passage is dilated by a
balloon and an expansile metallic mesh prosthesis is placed
to maintain the communication directly between the portal
vein and hepatic vein. This procedure results in bypassing liver
resistance and consequently decreases the portal pressure.
Experience in children is limited with an overall success rate is
approximately 75–85%.

Surgical Management
Emergency surgery is required when all the other therapeutic
measures have failed or when bleeding is from ectopic varices
that cannot be effectively controlled by endoscopic procedures.
Surgery can be done either in the form of portocaval
shunt (selective or nonselective) or devascularization with
esophageal staple transection.
Acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is a serious and lifethreatening complication of patients with portal hyper­tension.
Standard of care mandates early administration of vasoactive
drugs followed by endoscopic therapy preferably within 12
hours of bleed. Balloon tamponade followed by TIPS or surgery
may be done in patients who fail endoscopic and drug therapy.
All patients surviving an episode of AVB should undergo further
secondary prophylaxis with EST/EVL to prevent rebleeding.

Nonvariceal Bleeding
The etiology of nonvariceal UGIB is diverse and management
largely depends on the cause.

Pharmacological Therapy
Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) promote clot stability and
facilitate hemostasis by raising the intragastric pH. Proton
pump inhibitors infusion should be initiated in any patient
suspected to have nonvariceal bleeding from the upper
gastrointestinal tract as it reduces both the incidence of highrisk stigmata of hemorrhage on endoscopy [37.2 vs. 46.5%;

CHAPTER 78: Approach to Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed in Children
odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–0.84)
and the need for endoscopic hemostasis (8.6 vs. 11.7%; OR
0.68, 0.50–0.93).
Drugs like NSAID/aspirin/anticoagulants should be
stopped as far as possible in patients with UGIB.
Specific therapy: antifungal (fluconazole) in esophageal
candidiasis and specific antiviral therapy (acyclovir/gancylovir)
in esophagitis due to herpes/cytomegalovirus infection is
essential.
Helicobacter pylori infection should be looked for and
treated in all patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. The high
false-negative rate for H. pylori testing in the setting of acute
UGIB should be remembered. Triple therapy [PPI plus two
of the three antibiotics (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and
metronidazole)] for 7–10 days is the treatment of choice.
Dietary changes: stoppage of milk and milk products is
required for infants with UGIB due to cow’s milk allergy.

Endoscopic Therapy
An early (within 12–24 h) and meticulous UGI endoscopy done
after resuscitation of the patient is essential both for finding the
cause of NVB and offering therapy. Blood coming from papilla
at endoscopy suggests hemobilia or hemosuccus pancreaticus.
Pre-endoscopy administration of prokinetic is beneficial
in patients at risk of having blood obscuring endoscopic
visualization.
Endoscopic biopsies are taken to diagnose H. pylori
infection in patients with ulcer disease and in those with
esophagitis/gastritis. Endoscopic treatment is effective in
patients with focal sites of bleeding and involves injection
(adrenaline or hypertonic saline), electrocoagulation, heater
probes, and hemoclips application.
Peptic ulcer bleeding: endoscopic hemostasis using thermal or
mechanical therapies alone or in combination with injection
should be done in all patients with high-risk ulcers [Forrest
Ia (active spurting bleeding), Ib (active oozing bleeding), IIa
(nonbleeding visible vessel), and IIb (adherent clot)].
The intravenous PPI infusion should be continued for
72 hours as it has been shown to decrease rebleeding, need for
surgery and also mortality. Patients who have hemodynamic
instability, active bleeding at endoscopy, ulcer size over 2
cm, ulcer located in high lesser gastric curvature or posterior
duodenum, hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL, and need
for transfusion are at a higher risk of having rebleeding after
endoscopic hemostasis. The therapeutic options for patients
with postendotherapy rebleeding include repeat endoscopic
hemostasis, transcatheter arterial embolization of the bleeding
vessel and surgery.

Clinical Pearls
• Intravenous octreotide and proton pump inhibitors infusion
should be given to all patients with upper gastrointestinal
bleeding due to varices and peptic ulcer, respectively
• Endotherapy (endoscopic variceal ligation/endoscopic sclero­
therapy) is the main stay for management of variceal bleeding.

PREVENTION
•

•
•

Stress ulcers, erosions of the stomach and duodenum are
well-known complications of critical illness in children
admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (Fig. 3).
Nearly 10% of PICU subjects have UGIB but it is clinically
significant only in less than 2% cases. Children with
coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and high pediatric risk
of mortality score >10 are at an increased risk of bleeding.
Although literature is limited, pooled data from two
randomized controlled trials shows that prophylactic acid
neutralizing treatment was significantly more effective in
preventing UGIB compared with no treatment (two studies
= 300 participants; relative risk, 0.41; 95% CI 0.19–0.91)
Secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding by EST/EVL as
discussed above
H. pylori eradication therapy to prevent recurrence of
peptic ulcer. Eradication should be ensured by repeat
testing.

CONCLUSION
Acute UGIB is a potentially serious problem in children and
presents with hematemesis or melena. As the causes of UGIB
vary with age, it is important to evaluate children for the age
specific etiologies. Esophagitis, gastritis, and varices are the
most common causes of UGIB in Indian children with peptic
ulcer disease being uncommon. The approach to diagnosis is
largely dictated by the child’s condition. Prompt hemodynamic
stabilization is of utmost importance and physical examination
and blood investigations are done simultaneously. Upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy is the most useful diagnostic
and therapeutic tool for children presenting with UGIB.
Medications like octreotide and PPI are useful in variceal and
ulcer bleed respectively with surgery being reserved for cases
with continued bleed and failure of endoscopic therapy.

enteroscopy in the diagnostic armamentarium of LGIB has
given rise to a new term midgastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB)
for a bleed occurring anywhere distal to the ampulla of Vater
and up to the ileocecal valve. In this article, both small bowel
bleed (MGIB) and colonic bleed have been included in the
discussion.

TYPES OF BLEED
Lower gastrointestinal bleed may be overt or occult. Overt
bleeding can be acute massive or chronic intermittent and can
present as hematochezia (passage of frank blood per rectum),
melena or streaks of blood. Occult bleeding is not clinically
apparent but becomes manifest by laboratory evidence of
iron deficiency or chemical evidence of blood in the stool.
Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding refers to a bleed where the
bleeding site is not obvious even after evaluation by upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy, an ileocolonoscopy, or a contrast
radiological study of the small intestine.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in infants and children is
common in clinical practice yet its epidemiology has not been
well studied. In an emergency department in Boston, United
States, rectal bleeding was the prime complaint in 0.3% of more
than 40,000 patients with life-threatening bleed occurring in
4.2%, three of whom had ileocolic intussusception and one
Meckel’s diverticulum.

ETIOLOGY
The common causes of LGIB in children depend on the age of
presentation. In this article, the neonatal causes of LGIB have
not been included. The causes of LGIB are:
1. Gastrointestinal (Table 1)
2. Hematological: bleeding disorders, coagulation defects,
DIC, thrombocytopenia (dengue, idiopathic thrombo­
cytopenia purpura)
3. Vasculitic disorders: Henoch‒Schönlein purpura
4. Connective tissue disorders: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and
Cutis laxa
5. Factitious: various coloring agents, jelly, beetroot, and
drugs such as phenolphthalein or rifampicin can color the
stool.

Clinical Evaluation
A focused yet detailed history and physical examination are
essential in the evaluation of all children with LGIB.

History

374

A meticulous history including details such as whether
bleed is major or minor, chronic recurrent or acute massive,
treatment, and associated symptoms. Details of the bleed such
as duration, number of episodes, frequency, volume, color,
presence of clots, mucus, frank bleed, or mixed with feces
should be obtained. History will help in establishing the site
and probable etiology.
Site of bleed: 10% of UGIB may present with bleeding PR.
Hematemesis is suggestive of UGIB. Similarly, melena is more
often seen in UGIB, whereas hematochezia is usually from
small bowel or colon. Specks or streaks of bright red blood
indicate bleed from anorectal region.
Etiology: acute massive bleed may be due to Meckel’s
diverticulum, intestinal duplication, or arteriovenous
malformation. Eliciting certain associated symptoms in the
history help in determining the etiology of LGIB:
• Crampy abdominal pain and frequent loose stools mixed
with mucus and blood suggest an infectious, inflammatory,
or ischemic pathology
• Painless bleeding is more typical of a colonic polyp,
Meckel’s diverticulum, ulcerated duplication, or vascular
malformation
• Painful defecation with streaks of blood suggests anal
fissure
• Colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, red currant jelly stool,
and mass abdomen are suggestive of intussusception
• Constipation, mucorrhea, small rectal bleed, with or
without digital evacuation, and rectal prolapse may suggest
solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS)
• Recent antibiotic administration followed by passage
of blood and mucus in stools would indicate antibiotic
associated colitis or pseudomembranous colitis
• An infant with stools mixed with blood following
introduction of bovine milk protein one should suspect
Cow’s milk protein allergy
• An infant of normal weight on breast milk with blood in the
stool may have benign allergic proctocolitis due to transfer
of allergen through breast milk
• Passage of large volume, maroon or bright red blood
requiring blood transfusions suspect Meckel’s diverticulum,
intestinal duplication, or arteriovenous malformation
• Mass prolapsing per rectum with bleeding could be due to
a prolapsing polyp, prolapse rectum, or an intussusceptum
vascular. A polyp is globular and prolapses soon after
defecation, a prolapse is circumferential with a central
lumen whereas in intussusception severe pain is a
characteristic feature

A family history of bleeding PR requiring surgical
intervention polyposis coli may be a possibility
Failure to thrive, recurrent infections with bleeding PR may
point to immune deficiencies either congenital or human
immunodeficiency virus related
History of ingestion of beet or coloring agents suggests
factitious bleed
History of recurrent petechiae, ecchymosis, or epistaxis
in addition to bleeding PR may suggest a hematological
disorder
Abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of weight, pedal edema,
and fever suggests inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
History of abdominal pain, bleeding PR with rash on legs
and gluteal region suggests Henoch‒Schönlein purpura
History of fever, rash, features of third spacing, and bleeding
PR consider dengue fever
Cutaneous hemangioma and bleeding PR suspect blue
rubber bleb nevus syndrome (Fig. 1)
Family history of bleeding PR, buccal pigmentation
consider Peutz Jegher’s syndrome (Fig. 2)
Telengiectasia on fingers and lips with bleeding PR
consider hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia

CHAPTER 79: Management of Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed

Examination
General: in children with acute lower gastrointestinal bleed
whether major or minor a complete examination including
vital signs is necessary.
Skin: examination of the skin for petechia, ecchymosis, palpable
purpura (Figs 3 and 4) and hemangiomas, buccal pigmentation,
and café au lait spots to exclude familial syndromes.
Abdomen: Splenomegaly may indicate portal hypertension.
Right upper quadrant mass may indicate intussusception.
Distended abdomen with dilated bowel loops suggests intestinal
obstruction, volvulus, gangrene, or segmental enteritis.
Perianal examination: the presence of skin tags, perianal fistula
or fissure may be markers of IBD.

Investigations
Laboratory studies: basic investigations such as hemoglobin,
total and differential white blood cell count, platelet, bleeding
time, clotting time, and prothrombin time are included in the
investigative panel. Refractory iron deficiency anemia is an
important manifestation of occult gastrointestinal bleed and
should be evaluated diligently.

Stool examination: a simple macroscopic examination of the
stool is essential before considering sophisticated investigations.
Microscopic examination: if the stools show more than 10 pus
cells/HPF it may indicate an invasive form of colitis. Presence
of numerous eosinophils would suggest an allergic colitis
or cow’s milk protein allergy. The presence of trophozoites
with hemophagocytosis would be diagnostic of Entamoeba
histolytica infection. If the clinical setting is suggestive of
infectious colitis then stool culture for Shigella, Salmonella,
and Campylobacter jejuni may be helpful. Occult bleeding is
identified by testing stool for occult blood.
Radiology: plain X-ray abdomen is done when there is
pain, bilious vomiting, or features of intermittent intestinal
obstruction. Ultrasonography can detect bowel wall thickening
pseudokidney appearance or identify characteristic features
of intussusception such as target sign (Fig. 5). Air contrast or
saline contrast enema helps not only to confirm but also treat
ileocolonic intussusception. Computerized tomography or
magnetic resonance angiography is generally reserved for
evaluation of mass lesions or complex vascular anomalies.
Endosonography helps in the visualization of submucosal
lesions and arteriovenous malformations.
Radionuclide studies: scintigraphy is useful in the evaluation
of children with obscure but active LGI bleed of at least 0.1 mL/
minute. In young children with acute massive bleed if Meckel’s
diverticulum or duplication cyst is suspected radionuclide
studies may be done even prior to endoscopy. Radionuclide
study using technetium-99m (Tc99m) per­technetate helps to
identify ectopic gastric mucosa within a Meckel’s diverticulum
or a duplication cyst with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity 95%.
Technetium-labeled red blood cells identifies arteriovenous
malformations and bleeding ulcers.
Endoscopy: when the bleed is chronic and intermittent
ileocolonoscopy is preferred as the first line of investigation.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should always be done along
with ileocolonoscopy since 10% of upper gastrointestinal bleed
can present as bleeding per rectum.

SECTION 10: Gastroenterology
Ileocolonoscopy: early colonoscopy helps both in diagnosis
and therapy of mucosal lesions of the colon. The overall yield
ranges from 69 to 80%. Bowel preparation is safely achieved in
children using a standard oral polyethylene-glycol electrolyte
solution. Ileocolonoscopy helps both in the diagnosis and
therapy of LGIB. The majority of mucosal lesions, such as
allergic colitis, polyps, solitary rectal ulcer, IBD, vascular
malformations, rectal varices, portal colopathy (Figs 6–12),
can be diagnosed. Biopsy of the mucosal lesions will help in
confirming the etiology.

Additional Procedures
The above investigations will suffice to identify the source of
bleeding in the majority of children with LGIB. However, in
a small percentage (3–5%), the source will remain obscure
necessitating small bowel examination, either with triple
vessel arteriography, small bowel enema, magnetic resonance
enteroclysis, enteroscopy, or intraoperative enteroscopy.

Impaction of the capsule may occur if there is an underlying

Intraoperative Enteroscopy
In this procedure, both surgeon and endoscopist work as a team
in the evaluation of a child with LGIB. A pediatric colonoscope
or enteroscope can be negotiated through an operative
enterotomy and the small bowel visualized. It helps in detecting
the majority more than 85% of obscure small bowel bleeding
lesions. The surgeon guides the intestine over the scope and
examines the outer serosa by palpation and transillumination
while the endoscopist examines the inner mucosa.

Diagnostic Laparoscopy/Laparotomy

Fig. 11: Severe ulcerative colitis

In children with recurrent gastrointestinal bleed, and if
investigations are futile, it may be worthwhile performing
a diagnostic laparoscopy to identify lesions such as enteric
duplication cyst.

Management
The management of lower GI bleed includes prompt resusci­
tative measures and treatment of the specific condition by five
distinct modalities such as diet modification, medications,
endotherapy, radiological intervention, and surgery.

Diet
•

•

Fig. 12: Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia cow’s-milk protein allergy

Cow’s-milk protein allergy (CMPA): avoidance of bovine
milk protein and milk products till the age of 9 months to
1 year is recommended for all infants diagnosed as having
significant CMPA. Majority will be able to tolerate cow’s
milk protein by the age of 3–5 years
Fissure in ano and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS):
introduction of fruits and vegetables to increase bulk and
fiber will benefit children with LGIB due to fissure in ano
or SRUS.

Medications
Triple Arteriography

•

This is rarely necessary in children with LGIB. It is, however,
useful in obscure small bowel bleed if there is active bleeding
of at least 0.5 mL/minute. The advantage of arteriography is
that it helps both in localization and embolization of the lesion.

•

Double Balloon Enteroscopy
This procedure helps in visualizing the entire small bowel
up to the ileocecal valve. It is not regularly used in pediatrics
but may be warranted in older children and adolescents with
obscure LGIB.

Capsule Endoscopy
Children more than 5 years of age can swallow the capsule
but in younger children, it can be introduced endoscopically.
Capsule endoscopy is an excellent modality for identifying
obscure gastrointestinal bleed. The detection rate is higher
(87–92%) if the procedure is done during active bleed.

•

Bacillary dysentery: in India, the recommendation is to
consider infectious colitis as Shigella colitis and treat with
oral cefixime 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days if child is ambulant
and with intravenous ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg for those
hospitalized
Amoebic colitis: routine antiamebic medication
should not be prescribed for children with acute colitis.
Metronidazole 10 mg/kg/day thrice a day for 5 days
is given only if trophozoite with hemophagocytosis
suggestive of Entamoeba histolytica is identified or in
spite of two antibiotics which are known to be sensitive
for Shigella in that region have been administered and the
child has persistence of symptoms
Ulcer bleeds: proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole
at a dose of 0.7 to 1 mg/kg/day or H2 blockers, such as
ranitidine at a dose of 4–6 mg/kg/day, can be administered
or orally if the bleed is secondary to duodenal ulcer, gastric
ulcer, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced
gastrointestinal injury. Proton pump inhibitors score over

•

ranitidine in controlling ulcer bleeds and is recommended
at a dose of 1 mg/kg and given slow intravenous followed
by infusion
Coagulopathy: injection of vitamin K (1 mg/year of age,
maximum 10 mg) intravenous/intramuscular is given
when the bleed occurs in individuals with colopathy and
hepatocellular dysfunction. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
may be necessary in children with prolonged international
normalized ratio not responding to injection of vitamin K
Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy: in children with
LGIB secondary to thrombocytopenia as in dengue fever
or dengue shock syndrome platelet transfusion, FFP and
rarely recombinant factor V may be required
Variceal bleed: the role of octreotide and somatostatin is
well established in acute variceal bleed. When the bleed
is nonvariceal, somatostatin and its analog octreotide
(1–2 μg/kg bolus followed by 1 μg/kg/hour continuous
intravenous or 1 μg/kg every 8–12 hours subcutaneously
for 24–48 hours) may reduce the risk of continued or
recurrent bleeding. These vasoactives act by reducing the
splanchnic flow and may help in tiding over the crisis till
active intervention is available
Inflammatory bowel disease: in IBD, the bleeding
stops once the activity of the disease is controlled.
Inflammatory bowel disease is managed according to the
severity of disease. Five amino salicylic acid 40–50 mg/
kg/day is initiated in children with mild ulcerative
colitis (UC) and mild Crohn’s disease (CD). Steroids at a
dose of 1 mg/kg/day is given for induction of remission
and tapered over a period of 12 weeks in moderate
UC or CD. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine 6
mercaptopurine are excellent steroid sparing agents and
used in the phase of maintenance

•
•

Anal fissure can be managed with stool softeners and high
fiber diet
Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is managed by encouraging
the child to increase fiber in the diet and thus avoiding
constipation and straining during defecation. The child
is trained to acquire a proper and regular bowel habit. In
some situations, several sittings of biofeed back therapy
may be required. Various modalities of topical therapy
have been tried such as 5 amino salicylic acid suppository
and sucralfate enema. When the bleed is severe and
not responding to dietary modifications Argon plasma
coagulation and surgery may be recommended.

Endotherapy
•
•

If SRUS does not respond to medications, endoscopic
laserization with argon plasma can be attempted
Colonic polyps are managed by endoscopic polypectomy

Interventional Radiology
•
•

Intussusception in infants less than 2 years can be reduced
either with air or saline enema
When the bleed occurs due to an arteriovascular
malformation or a bleeding, aneurysm embolization using
coils is an excellent method to arrest the bleed.

Surgery
•
•
•

Children with familial polyposis coli are advised total
colectomy to prevent malignancy
Intussusception which has not been reduced by pneumatic
reduction should be tackled surgically
Meckel’s diverticulum, volvulus, and duplication are all
managed surgically.

CONCLUSION

SUGGESTED READINGS

Lower gastrointestinal bleed presenting as bleeding per
rectum is a common problem in children and may be due to
several causes. The bleed may be very insignificant or sinister.
A careful detailed history and clinical examination will help
in diagnosis. Since acute massive bleed in young children
is usually due to Meckel’s diverticulum or duplication cysts,
radio nuclide scan using Tc99m pertechnetate may be done as
a precedent to ileocolonoscopy. The given algorithm 1 for LGIB
should be modified according to the age of the child, clinical
presentation, and feasibility of investigation.

Clinical Pearls
• Lower gastrointestinal bleed may be insignificant or sinister in
presentation
• Detailed history and simple macroscopic examination of stool
is the most important tool in evaluation
• Meckel’s scan should be included in the initial diagnostic
workup of infants with acute massive bleed
• Ileocolonoscopy is a safe procedure for both diagnosis and
therapy of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

Acute Liver Failure
Vidyut Bhatia, Anupam Sibal, Akshay Kapoor

INTRODUCTION
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a devastating illness associated
with high mortality mainly due to rapid death or injury
to a large proportion of hepatocytes, leaving insufficient
functional hepatocytes to sustain life. Acute liver failure is a
multisystem disorder wherein liver cell function dysfunction
and coagulopathy exist with or without the presence of
encephalopathy. Recently, the gastroenterology chapter of
Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) has published guidelines
for the management of ALF. The management of ALF described
in this chapter is largely based on the IAP guidelines.

DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS
Earlier classification of ALF was based on the time interval
between jaundice and onset of encephalopathy. However, this
definition failed to capture the complexities associated with
ALF in infants and children. Since in most young children and
infants it is difficult to define and classify encephalopathy, the
current definition relies more on coagulopathy as an index of
liver function.
The consensus report of the gastroenterology subspeciality
chapter of IAP has defined ALF as “Severe hepatocellular
injury presenting with biochemical evidence of liver injury
and uncorrectable coagulopathy 6–8 hours after one dose of
parenteral Vitamin K. Uncorrectable coagulopathy is defined
as INR >1.5 in patients with HE or INR >2.0 in patients without
HE, with no previous evidence of CLD”.
As noted above, staging of hepatic encephalopathy in
infants and young children is difficult as compared to adults.
The grading as recommended by the guidelines is as follows.
Grades I and II are indistinguishable with clinical features of
inconsolable cry and poor attention to tasks, inappropriate
behavior, and hyperreflexia. In grade III, somnolence, stupor,
combativeness, and hyperreflexia are present. In grade IV,
the child is comatose, arousable with painful stimuli (IVa)
or no response (IVb). Reflexes are absent and neurological
manifestations like decerebration or decortication are seen.

Ch-80.indd 380

Clinical Pearl
• Encephalopathy is not essential to make a diagnosis of acute
liver failure in children.

ETIOLOGY OF ACUTE LIVER FAILURE IN INDIA
Acute viral hepatitis is the most common cause of ALF either
alone or in combination with other etiologies. The other
underlying causes of ALF are given in table 1.

DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP
Table 2 summarizes the diagnostic work-up necessary to
establish the etiology of ALF. An approach to a child presenting
with features of acute liver diseases is presented in algorithm 1.

TRANSPORT AND INITIAL MANAGEMENT
The main objective of transporting a child with ALF is to ensure
safe and timely transfer to a tertiary center with liver transplant
facilities. It is important to act early because the risks involved
with patient transport may increase or even preclude transfer
once deeper stages of encephalopathy are reached. Any child
who develops grade III encephalopathy should be intubated and
the airway secured before transport. A continuous monitoring of
vital parameters should be available during transport.

Algorithm  1
Approch to a child with acute liver disease

Clinical Pearl
• Sedation should be given to a child only when support for
intubation and ventilation is available.

SUPPORTIVE MANAGEMENT
Medications or devices that may support a failing liver is the
holy grail of current hepatology research on the management
of ALF. Most of the drugs currently being used have not
undergone vigorous clinical trials before being used in the
management of ALF. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has been used
in the management of ALF secondary to acetaminophen
poisoning. There is increasing evidence for its use in nonacetaminophen causes of ALF. NAC can be used in the dose
of 100 mg/kg/24 hours. Its role has been questioned by a
recent multicentric study, wherein it was seen as no better
than placebo. However, most patients in this study were not
infectious hepatitis related (only 10%), and a large proportion
of the (50%) patients were found to be ineligible for the study
(50% of these are recorded as “reasons unknown”). Moreover,
the study was conducted over a period of 9 years leading
to heterogeneity in treatment received over the years as
treatment modalities do change with time.
Ammonia is an accepted triggering factor in cerebral
edema; however, agents that decrease blood ammonia levels
(L-ornithine L-aspartate, lactulose and other non-absorbable
antibiotics) have not been found to be beneficial. Protein
restriction in children with hepatic encephalopathy is no
longer recommended. Energy intakes should be increased
appropriately to counter catabolic stat. Prophylactic adminis­
tration of proton pump inhibitors in ALF is found to be useful
as it is helpful in prevention of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Specific therapy should be administered if the underlying
cause of ALF has been determined (Box 1).

MANAGEMENT OF RAISED
INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE

INR, international normalized ratio; ALF, acute liver failure.

The management of child with ALF should always be done
in the intensive care unit of the hospital. Initial management
includes placement of a central venous catheter line, volume
resuscitation as per protocol, glucose given at least 4–6 mg/
kg/min, so as to keep the blood glucose level between
120–200 mg/dL, and use of vasoactive drugs if required. All
such medications that decrease the level of consciousness
should be avoided to prevent worsening of encephalopathy.
If sedation is mandatory (e.g., for intubation) a short acting
agent like propofol can be given.

Ch-80.indd 381

Raised intracranial pressure more than 20 mmHg occurring as
a consequence of cerebral edema is one of the leading causes of
mortality in ALF. Sustained severe hypertension, bradycardia,
pupillary changes, reflexes (brisk—sluggish), muscle tone
changes, and decerebrate posturing are clinical indicators of
presence of cerebral edema.
Children with lower grade encephalopathy (I–II) should be
managed in a quiet environment and general measures such
as treating fever, infection, and seizures must be implemented.
However, if encephalopathy progresses to a higher grade,
endotracheal intubation must be done.
Prophylactic administration of 3% saline to maintain
sodium at 145–155 mmol/L in patients with severe encephalo­
pathy is recommended over mannitol. However, once
obvious neurological signs develop, a bolus of intravenous
mannitol (0.25–1 g/kg, 20% mannitol) over 15 minutes must
be given. This can be repeated if serum osmolality is less than
320 mOsmol/L.

factors, altered platelet number and function, intravascular
coagulation, and altered blood vessel wall integrity. Routine
correction of coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia is not
recommended. Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not
recommended, as it does not reduce the risk of significant
bleeding nor transfusion requirements and obscures the
trend of international normalized ratio (INR) as a prognostic
marker. However, replacement with FFP is recommended in
patients with clinically significant bleeding, while performing
invasive procedures or in situations where INR >7. Single dose
of vitamin K1 (5–10 mg, slowly not more than 1 mg/min) is
recommended empirically in all patients with ALF. According
to the consensus statement, platelet transfusion is not
recommended unless a threshold platelet count of 10,000–
20,000/mm3 is reached or there is significant bleeding and
thrombocytopenia less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter.
A platelet count of 50–70,000/mm3 is usually considered
adequate when an invasive procedure is to be performed.

Clinical Pearl

Ch-80.indd 382

• Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma is only recommended when
any invasive procedure is attempted.

SEPSIS
Infection remains one of the major causes of death in patients
with ALF. The reasons for increased sepsis in these children are
management in intensive care with invasive modalities, neutro­
penia (secondary to bone marrow suppression), deranged
neutrophil function (due to defective sodium pump) and
defective opsonization (due to decreased plasma complement).
The most commonly isolated organisms are Gram-positive
cocci (Staphylococci, Streptococci), enteric Gram-negative
bacilli, and Candida albicans. Prophylactic antibiotics or
antifungals have not been shown to improve outcome or
survival in patients with ALF. However, as suggested in the
recommendations, “empirical administration of antibiotics is
recommended when
• Infection or the likelihood of impending sepsis is high, e.g.,
surveillance cultures reveal significant isolates
• Progression of, or advanced stage (III/IV) HE
• Refractory hypotension
• Renal failure
• Presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome
components (temperature >38 or <36°C, white blood count
>12,000 or <4,000/mm3, tachycardia)
• Empirical antibiotics are also recommended for patients
listed for liver transplantation, since infection often results
in delisting or delay and immunosuppression postliver
transplantation is imminent.”
Broad-spectrum coverage with a third-generation cephalo­
sporin and an antifungal have been recommended.

LIVER ASSIST DEVICES
The high cost of liver transplantation, lifetime immuno­
suppression, limited availability of donors, and risk of death
while awaiting liver transplantation have stimulated the
development of liver assist devices (LAD) and other modalities
like plasmapheresis, exchange transfusions, extracorporal blood
cleansing, devices containing cultured hepatocytes, crosscirculation with animals, and molecular adsorbent recirculating
system. Experience on the use of LAD in children is limited and
restricted to case reports or small series.

HEPATOCYTE TRANSPLANTATION
Hepatocyte transplantation has been performed in patients
with ALF as a potential alternative to liver transplantation.
Cryopreserved hepatocytes are usually infused into the
intrahepatic portal vein with many cells rapidly cleared by
the innate immune system, which needs to be prevented.
Newer methods that utilize encapsulation of hepatocytes are
being used through the intraperitoneal route in ALF with the
advantage of avoiding immunosuppression.

CRITERIA FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Liver transplantation is the only definite treatment available
for ALF. Several prognostic scores have been used to identify
children who may benefit from an early liver transplantation.
These include King’s College Hospital criteria, pediatric endstage liver disease score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II, and Clichy criteria. However, an INR >4 or
factor V concentration of less than 25%, as recommended in

11/21/2016 10:41:25 AM

Chapter 80: Acute Liver Failure
the consensus statement, are by far the best available criteria
for listing for liver transplantation. Acute fulminant Wilson’s
disease has a high mortality necessitating liver transplantation
in most cases. Special prognostic score is now available for
these children and a score of 11 or more indicates mortality,
with 93% sensitivity and 98% specificity.
Recently, the authors performed a survey of seven major
transplant centers across India. Out of approximately 355
pediatric liver transplantation performed at these centers, ALF
constituted about 19% of all cases. In India, majority of liver
transplants are living related, as cadaveric donation is a rarity.
A welcome development has been the increasing numbers of
fathers willing to come forward as donors. Another positive
aspect has been the involvement of community in arranging
for funds for those who cannot afford liver transplantation.
The availability of generic immunosuppressant drugs and
consumables has greatly aided in bringing doing costs. The
average cost of transplant in India is 12–15 lakhs. This is only
about 1/5th to 1/10th the cost in the West.
The paucity of facilities for liver transplantation in several
regions of the world has prompted many foreign nationals to
come to India for liver transplants. India has now become a
major center for liver transplantation for international patients
because of the high quality—low cost value proposition.
Children from over 20 countries have now received a liver
transplantation in India (personal communication).

Clinical Pearl
• International normalized ratio >4 is the best available
parameter for listing for transplant.

PROGNOSIS AND OUTCOME
In more than 50% of children with ALF, there is poor survival
unless liver transplantation is offered at the appropriate
time. Prognostic factors that have been found to predict poor
outcome in ALF include unknown etiology, high grade (III/IV)
of encephalopathy, time to onset of encephalopathy more than
7 days, higher bilirubin (>17.5 mg/dL), lower ALT (≤2384 IU/L),
uncorrected prothrombin time more than 55s and clinical signs of
cerebral edema. Children with encephalopathy and coagulopathy
have a poorer outcome than those with coagulopathy alone.

Corrosive Injury in Children
Barath Jagadisan

INTRODUCTION
In a pediatric emergency room, ingestion of corrosive
substances by children and adolescents is not an uncommon
cause of visit. Children beyond 1 year of age and less than 6
years, who are ambulant and inquisitive and who can drink
from bottles are the ones who commonly come with accidental
ingestion. The common practice of storing acid toilet cleaners
in bottles meant for beverages and water is one of the reasons
for accidental ingestion. Corrosive ingestion for self-harm,
similar to that seen in adults, is usually seen in adolescent
age group. Based on the data available from the American
Association of Poison Control Centers, children under the
age of 6 years account for 51% of individuals who ingest
corrosives. Such data are not available in developing countries
due to under-reporting of cases resulting from the absence of
effectively functioning poison control centers or systematic
data collection.

TYPES OF CORROSIVES
The corrosives ingested may be common household solutions
like toilet cleaners, household bleach, laundry detergents,
drain cleaners and oven cleaners or they may be farm and
industrial chemicals stored in the house. Thus, parental
occupation also seems to have an influence on corrosive
injury in children. A popular herbicide, paraquat, which is
widely stored in agrarian rural households is corrosive in
nature and is available in containers that are not child proof.
Children from households of goldsmiths come with accidental
ingestion of aqua regia, a combination of hydrochloric
and nitric acid. Broadly, these corrosives are classified as
acids and alkalis. Unlike in the west, acid ingestion is more
common in developing countries like India because of the
free availability of acids.

Ch-81.indd 384

PATHOGENESIS OF CORROSIVE INJURY
The nature and severity of corrosive injury is a function of
the type of corrosive (acid/alkali; table 1), amount ingested,
concentration of the corrosive and the physical state of the
corrosive (solid/liquid). Acids cause coagulative necrosis
of the mucosa. This results in the formation of eschar on the
surface of the esophagus. If the amount of acid consumed is
less, the eschar might prevent further penetration of the acid
into deeper tissue. In contrast, alkalis produce liquefactive
necrosis, saponification and thrombosis of underlying vessels
and thereby have the potential to penetrate deep into the tissue
causing transmural injury and perforation. This distinction is
not absolute since acids cause deep injuries and perforation
when ingested in higher amounts. The volume of ingestion is
more in self-harm rather than in accidental ingestion. Hence,
the proportion of severe injury is less in children compared
to that in adolescents. Also, because of their higher viscosity
and longer time for clearance from the esophagus, alkalis can
potentially cause predominant damage to the esophagus while
acids are rapidly cleared into the stomach causing predominant

gastric injury. Again, this distinction is more theoretical rather
than a reality as acid ingestion causing deep esophageal injury is
not uncommon. The concentration of the corrosive determines
the depth of injury and time taken for clinical deterioration.
Solid corrosives have a prolonged contact with the mouth and
esophagus while liquids are rapidly cleared into the stomach.
The antrum and pylorus are the areas that receive the corrosive
first from the esophagus and thus perforation and strictures
are seen more in these areas. Apart from the local effects,
corrosives like acids have significant systemic complications
including disseminated intravascular coagulation and organ
(renal, hepatic) dysfunctions. A common cause of death in
paraquat ingestion is acute lung injury.
The sequence of events following a corrosive ingestion is
depicted in algorithm 1. Before 4 weeks, the tensile strength
of the tissue is less and hence late endoscopies beyond 96
hours carry a risk of perforation. For the same reason, stricture
dilatation is usually not attempted before 3 weeks after
corrosive injury. The process of fibrosis progresses even after
epithelialization and hence the stricture continues to worsen.
Therefore, a much delayed follow-up endoscopy will detect
mature tight strictures where, even visualization of a lumen for
cannulation and dilatation becomes difficult.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The manifestations of corrosive injury include:
• Airway injury in the form of stridor and dyspnea
• Refusal of feeds

Drooling of saliva

Hematemesis. Large volume hematemesis is seen with
extensive gastric injury
• Oral cavity may show erythema, edema, bleeding and
ulceration
• Systemic involvement in the form of acute lung injury,
renal and hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular
coagulation
• Perforation and mediastinitis leading to death.
The clinical presentation in a tertiary care center is not
necessarily an exact representation of the spectrum of injury
and clinical manifestations of CI, as children with extensive
injury and rapid deterioration are unlikely to reach the hospital.
In an attempt to find a noninvasive indicator of injury or its
severity, the presence of symptoms and oral cavity injury have
been compared with endoscopic findings in the esophagus
and stomach. Among 378 children with corrosive injury,
symptoms were shown to have no correlation with esophageal
injury. Eighty two percent of the symptomatic children had no
esophageal injury while 12% of asymptomatic children were
shown to have severe esophageal injury. Even though increasing
number of symptoms may correlate with a greater likelihood
of significant injury, deep mucosal injuries can occur without
symptoms. The presence of airway injury in the form of stridor
is frequently associated with esophageal injury, but most
studies indicate that no single symptom or group of symptoms
can reliably predict esophageal or gastric injury. Similarly,
the absence of oral lesions does not rule out esophageal
injury. Esophageal injury can be found in up to 61% children
in the absence of oral lesions. The reverse is also true where
significant oral cavity lesions may not have any distal injury.
These observations are the basis of recommending endoscopic
assessment in all children with corrosive injury irrespective of
their symptoms or their oral cavity manifestations.
This does not undermine the importance of clinical
examination. The presence of respiratory symptoms points
to the need for early management of airway or pulmonary
problems. Careful clinical examination together with computed
tomography (CT) is more relevant in diagnosing perforation
rather than endoscopy alone. Since perforation can occur at
any time in the first 2 weeks, any clinical worsening or new
symptoms should be carefully evaluated.

INVESTIGATIONS IN THE ACUTE PHASE
Chest and Abdominal Radiographs
Radiographs of the chest and abdomen may show evidence
of mediastinal air or subdiaphragmatic air in the case of
esophageal or gastric perforation. In the case of esophageal
perforation, there is evidence of mediastinitis and pleural
effusion.

Section 10: Gastroenterology

Laboratory Investigations
Investigations to look for acidosis, dyselectrolytemia, dis­
seminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ
dysfunctions are relevant in a sick child prior to surgery and as
part of monitoring during the course of management.

Early Endoscopic Evaluation
Endoscopic evaluation provides an evaluation of the extent of
mucosal injury and an estimate of its severity in terms of the
possible transmural extent of the injury and thereby, guides
management and helps in prognostication.
The selection of time for endoscopic evaluation has varied
in the past. Since ongoing mucosal necrosis and sloughing
increases the friability of tissues, endoscopy is done before
96 hours. The practice of delaying endoscopy with the idea
of visualizing a more mature state of necrosis is not preferred
nowadays. Most endoscopists prefer early endoscopy within
72 hours because of the lower risk of perforation. Endoscopic
assessment, in the hands of an expert, is a safe procedure when
done with care.
Endoscopic assessment is contraindicated in the case of
severe hypopharyngeal injury and in the case of perforation. It
is best done under sedation. Deep sedation without intubation
is required in children. Routine anesthesia and intubation is
not preferred unless there is stridor and respiratory problems.
Caution is to be exercised in the case of epiglottic or laryngeal
inlet edema where respiratory problems are anticipated
and intubation is advisable. The principles of endoscopy in
corrosive ingestion include gentle scope maneuvering and
minimal air insufflation. It is recommended that the scope
is not negotiated beyond severe mucosal injuries of grade 3
especially if it is circumferential. Some endoscopists do not
follow this rule and consider it safe to negotiate beyond these
severe injuries also.
The purpose of endoscopy is to grade the mucosal injury.
Injury is graded as in table 2. Presence of perforation may
be referred to as grade 4 injury where endoscopy is contra­
indicated.
Many cases of corrosive injury may not have any
gastrointestinal injury, more so in the cases of accidental
ingestion. These patients identified by endoscopy can be

discharged early. The injury grading correlates well with
morbidity and mortality. Children with grades 1 and 2A injury
do not usually develop strictures. Stricture frequency in grade 3
injury may approach up to 75%. Mortality is more in grade 3
injuries. Endoscopic grading can guide the need for feeding
jejunostomy. Extensive grade 3b injuries may necessitate
emergency surgical procedures.
A grade 3 injury may not always indicate a definite
transmural involvement. Emergency resective surgery guided
by endoscopic mucosal injury grading alone may result in
unnecessary gastrectomy and esophagectomy in 12–15% cases,
thus necessitating a better mode of identifying transmural injury.
Endoscopic ultrasound with miniprobes has been used in
corrosive injury to predict the risk of stricture in follow-up. In
patients who have developed stricture, endoscopic ultrasound
with a radial probe has been used to predict the response to
dilatation.

Computed Tomography
Unlike endoscopy which assesses only the mucosal aspect of
the injury, CT provides information on the extent of transmural
injury. In situations where clinical assessment suggests a
high possibility of perforation even in the absence of obvious
evidence of perforation in chest and abdominal radiographs, a
CT rather than an endoscopy should be the first investigation to
be performed to look for perforation. Computed tomography
grading of the injury has also been used as a modality to predict
the risk of stricture formation but is not routinely done for this
purpose alone.

MANAGEMENT (ALGORITHM 2)
Management in the Acute Phase
Adherence to the basic tenets of emergency care is essential in
the management of patients with corrosive injury. The patient
is assessed for respiratory distress and airway intubation or
tracheostomy may be required in cases with airway problems.
Epiglottic and supraglottic edema are harbingers for airway
compromise even in the absence of symptoms at presentation.
The patient’s ventilation and hemodynamic status may require
support in cases with perforation.
There is no role for gastric lavage or inducing emesis to
remove the corrosive. Inducing emesis will only lead to repeat
exposure of proximal mucosa to the corrosive and lead to
aspiration of the corrosive. Similarly, attempts at neutralization
of the corrosive by weak acids or weak bases will prove counter
productive. Milk and activated charcoal should be avoided.
Blind placement of nasogastric tube should be avoided.
This might lead to perforation. Some centers prefer placing a
endoscopically guided nasojejunal tube to assist feeding and
to use it as a stent that might maintain at least a narrow lumen
that can be used for cannulation during stricture dilatation.
This is controversial and is discouraged by others as the tube
increases reflux and might lead to the development of long
strictures. The latter view is contested as one study shows
equivalence of nasojejunal feeding with jejunostomy feeding

Chapter 81: Corrosive Injury in Children
Algorithm 2

in maintaining nutrition in patients with corrosive injury
without increasing the frequency of strictures.
Based on the data suggesting the presence of lower
esophageal sphincter relaxation, high frequency of acid
reflux into the esophagus and the preliminary data showing
impressive healing of corrosive injury with infusion of proton
pump inhibitors (PPI), administration of PPI, at least as bolus
doses, is a regular practice.
Systemic steroid use with the purpose of preventing
strictures is to be avoided as meta-analysis analyzing steroid
use in corrosive injury has shown that steroids do not provide
this benefit. Also, the risk of infections may be increased
with steroid use. There is always the theoretical possibility of
steroids masking features of inflammation arising from bowel
perforation. Systemic steroids are indicated only in cases with
airway edema.
Antibiotics are not routinely indicated. They are used
only in cases with perforation. In addition, broad spectrum
antibiotics may be relevant in cases receiving steroids for
airway edema.
When there is overt clinical or radiological evidence of
perforation, emergency laparotomy is required. In case of high
index of suspicion of perforation, laparotomy may be indicated
even in the absence of radiological evidence. When there is
ambiguity regarding perforation in a clinically stable patient,
CT may be useful to look for evidence of perforation. If there
is no suspicion of perforation on clinical and radiological
assessment, the patient is subjected to endoscopic assessment
of mucosal injury. The decision for early surgery is not entirely
dependent on overt clinical or radiological signs of perforation.
In case of acidosis, renal injury or hemodynamic instability,

Ch-81.indd 387

early surgery is essential in view of the high suspicion of
perforation. Any clinical suspicion of perforation based on the
general condition of the patient and the quantity of corrosive
ingested, should lead to an early surgical exploration.
In patients in whom endoscopic assessment of mucosal
injury has been done, the grade of injury guides further
management. Children with normal mucosa can be
discharged immediately. Children with grades 1 and 2A injury
can be allowed to take orally and can be discharged after a
brief period of observation when oral intake is satisfactory.
Children with grades 2B and 3 injuries are restricted from
oral intake. In cases of grades 2B and 3A injuries, where oral
intake is restricted, the choice of nutrition delivery is between
total parenteral nutrition (TPN), jejunostomy feeding and
endoscopically placed nasoenteral tube feeding. Most
centers, at least in developing countries, avoid TPN due to
the high cost and high frequency of infections. Kochhar et al.,
in a retrospective study comparing nasoenteric feeding and
jejunostomy feeding, had shown that nasoenteric feeding
maintains a comparable nutrition status without increased
stricture rates. The tube also provides a lumen for guidewire
passage during future dilatation. This study also included
cases of 3B mucosal injury that did not require a laparotomy,
who were fed by nasoenteral feeding.
The role of emergency surgical procedure in the presence
of evidence of perforation or a massive hemorrhage is quite
obvious. These situations are dealt with by esophagectomy and
cervical esophagostomy when the esophagus is perforated.
The area of the stomach with transmural involvement may
need resection. The entire stomach may need resection. A
gastrostomy during surgery provides an accurate assessment
of the extent of involvement. There is no role for surgical
closure of perforations. Distal jejunostomy is required to
maintain nutrition. In case of extensive grade 3B injuries,
laparotomy may be required to look for transmural extensive
necrosis that can be a harbinger of perforation. The surgery
may result in variable degree of resection and a jejunostomy
for feeding. The role of laparoscopy in such situations is
controversial in view of long operating time involved in the
procedure and the difficulty in thorough assessment of extent
of injury.

Management of Strictures
Stricture frequency increases with increasing grades of
mucosal injury. Systemic steroids do not prevent strictures.
Strictures in the esophagus present with dysphagia and
aspiration pneumonia while strictures in the antral and pyloric
area present with features of gastric outlet obstruction. It is
always preferable to have a contrast radiograph before an
endoscopic evaluation of the stricture as it gives an idea of the
position, number and length of strictures and information on
the presence of diverticulae. On radiography with oral contrast,
stricture is seen as an area of narrowing with hold-up of contrast
proximal to the stricture. Depending on the chronicity of the
stricture, there can be variable degrees of proximal dilatation.
Diverticulae are common in corrosive strictures, especially
those presenting late. Barium would be the preferable contrast

387

11/21/2016 10:43:35 AM

Section 10: Gastroenterology
except in children with severe dysphagia where there is a
possibility of aspiration of the contrast.
Stricture dilatation before 3 weeks after corrosive injury
is not advisable due to the high risk of perforation. At the
same time, delayed dilatations lead to a nonvisualization of
lumen for dilatation, strictures refractory to dilatation and
poor nutrition of the child. Long strictures are common after
corrosive injury, where Savary‒Gillard (bougie) dilator may be
preferred to a balloon dilator. Refractory strictures may require
local triamcinolone injection or mitomycin application. In
cases presenting months after corrosive injury, dilatation may
not be possible and surgical correction may be the only option.
Detailed discussion of surgical reconstructive procedures
to correct the late sequelae of corrosive injury is beyond the
scope of this review.

Long-term Complications of Corrosive Injury
The long-term complications include dysmotility and possible
risk of dysplasia and malignancy in the affected tissue.

CONCLUSION
In summary, the optimal management of corrosive injury is
dependent on adherence to the basic tenets of life support,
avoidance of lavage or emesis, early and optimal selection of
patients for emergency surgical resection, decision making
guided by endoscopic evaluation, close attention to nutrition,
and avoiding delay in stricture detection and management.
The free availability of acids in the unregulated market is a
problem in many developing countries where acids are used as
toilet cleaners, leading to a high frequency of corrosive injury.
Rules governing concentration of household caustics and child
resistant packaging of toilet cleaners and other corrosives need
to be strictly implemented.

Clinical Pearls
• Oral manifestations and symptoms do not predict the degree
of esophageal and gastric mucosal injury
• Blind nasogastric tube insertion, lavage, emesis, charcoal and
milk are to be avoided after corrosive injury
• Steroids are indicated only in cases of airway edema
• Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is indicated in all children with
CI who do not have perforation or severe hypopharyngeal injury.

Chronic Abdominal Pain
Sarah Paul, John Matthai

Introduction

Box 1: Red flag signs in chronic abdominal pain

Chronic (recurrent) abdominal pain is the commonest
abdominal symptom that a pediatrician confronts in his
practice. Modifying the conventional definition by Apley,
the symptom duration has recently been reduced from 3 to
2 months and the preferred term as chronic abdominal pain
(CAP). Advances in investigative facilities over the years have
failed to yield a cause in a majority of children. This has led
to the concept of functional abdominal pain, wherein the
pain is real and not imaginary, and may be related to stress,
environmental and familial factors.

CLASSIFICATION
Rome III criteria laid down in 2006 categorized pain related
functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) into five groups
(Table 1) and laid down diagnostic criteria for each.

Red Flag Signs
Chronic abdominal pain may not always be functional. The red
flag signs that suggest a possible organic basis are given in box 1.

Clinical Pearl
• Do not ignore red flag signs in abdominal pain. Investigate
children with any of them.
Table 1: Rome III criteria-H2: abdominal pain-related functional
gastrointestinal disorder

• Clearly localized/radiating pain
• Pain that wakes the child from
sleep

Childhood functional abdominal pain syndrome

Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnostic criteria must include all of the following (at least
once per week for at least 2 months):
• Persistent or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the
upper abdomen (above the umbilicus)
• Not relieved by defecation or associated with the onset of
a change in stool frequency or stool form [i.e., not irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS)]
• No evidence of an inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or
neoplastic process that explains the subject’s symptoms.

Evaluation
The dyspeptic symptoms may follow a viral infection. Delayed
gastric emptying, disordered gastric myoelectrical activity, and
altered antroduodenal motility are implicated in pathogenesis.
An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is not mandatory
for making a diagnosis, unless the patient has dysphagia or
symptoms improve with antacids and relapse on withdrawal
or Helicobacter pylori disease is suspected.

Treatment
Avoidance of drugs particularly analgesics, and specific foods
that aggravate symptoms should be avoided. Antacids and

11/21/2016 10:48:16 AM

Section 10: Gastroenterology
prokinetics may offer symptom relief in some patients, but
their routine use is not recommended without an upper GI
endoscopy. A search for psychological factors may be made in
appropriate settings.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnostic criteria must include all of the following (at least
once per week for at least 2 months):
• Abdominal discomfort (an uncomfortable sensation not
described as pain) or pain associated with two or more of
the following, at least 25% of the time:
{{ Symptoms improved with defecation
{{ Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool (4
or more stools per day and 2 or less stools per week)
{{ Onset associated with a change in form of stool
• No evidence of an inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or
neoplastic process that explains the subject’s symptoms.

Evaluation
Visceral hypersensitivity related to genetic predisposition and
early stressful events is a likely cause. Anxiety, depression,
and multiple somatic complaints are often reported not only
by the patient, but also by the parents. In the absence of red
flag signs, a positive diagnosis of IBS can be made without any
investigations.

Treatment
A confident diagnosis, reasonable explanation of pain
experience, and reassurance are by themselves therapeutic.
While peppermint oil is reported beneficial in children, antidepressants have not been proven useful.

Clinical Pearl
• Abdominal discomfort associated with a change in frequency
or form of the stool and improves on defecation suggests
irritable bowel syndrome.

Abdominal Migraine
Diagnostic Criteria

390

Diagnostic criteria must include all of the following (two or
more times in the preceding 12 months):
• Paroxysmal episodes of intense acute periumbilical pain
that lasts for 1 hour or more
• Intervening periods of usual health lasting weeks to months
• The pain interferes with normal activities
• The pain is associated with two or more of the following:
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, photophobia, and
pallor
• No evidence of an inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or
neoplastic process that explains the subject’s symptoms.

Ch-82.indd 390

Evaluation
Cyclic vomiting syndrome, migraine headache, and
abdominal migraine are believed to be the spectrum of the
same disease with overlap. Family history of migraine and
motion sickness, are therefore, often present. In appropriate
settings, subacute obstruction of the intestine, urinary and
biliary tract, as well as chronic pancreatitis and porphyria
should be ruled out. Response to migraine prophylactic drugs
is supportive evidence.

Treatment
Avoidance of potential triggers, like caffeine, prolonged
fasting, sleep deprivation, and exposure to flickering
lights, may be suggested. In those with recurrent episodes,
propranolol, cyproheptadine, and sumatriptan can be tried.

Childhood Functional Abdominal Pain
Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnostic criteria must include all of the following (at least
once per week for at least 2 months):
• Episodic or continuous abdominal pain
• Insufficient criteria for other FGIDs
• No evidence of an inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or
neoplastic process that explains the subject’s symptoms.

Evaluation
These children are not troubled by their symptoms and
parental anxiety is the main compounding factor. No
investigations are necessary in the absence of any red flag
signs, provided the parents can be convinced of the diagnosis.

Treatment
Parents need to be reassured that there is no organic basis.
Placebo drugs should be discouraged. Psychological evaluation
is not necessary.

Childhood Functional Abdominal Pain Syndrome
Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnostic criteria must include childhood functional
abdominal pain at least 25% of the time, and one or more of the
following (at least once per week for at least 2 months):
• Some loss of daily functioning
• Additional somatic symptoms, such as headache, limb
pain, or difficulty in sleeping.

Evaluation
A limited screening which includes complete blood count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein,
urinalysis, and urine culture is indicated. Other investigations
may be decided by the clinician depending on the predominant
symptom and degree of functional impairment. Anxiety
depression and somatization may be seen in the patient and
parents.

Chapter 82: Chronic Abdominal Pain

Treatment
The contribution of psychosocial factors should be evaluated
and behavioral therapy can give positive results.

APPROACH TO A CASE OF
CHRONIC ABDOMINAL PAIN
Children presenting with CAP can broadly be classified into
three groups, based on the pattern of pain (Table 2).
1. Isolated paroxysmal periumbilical CAP
2. Chronic abdominal pain with dyspepsia
3. Chronic abdominal pain with altered bowel habits.

Clinical Pearl
• Isolated paroxysmal periumbilical pain in children is most
commonly functional pain.

MANAGEMENT OF FUNCTIONAL PAIN
The first step in management is making a positive diagnosis.
Parental counseling should be well planned with an
unequivocal reassurance that there is no organic disease and
that the prognosis is good. They need to understand that the
pain is real and the child is not feigning, but there is no need for
medication. Hospitalization is ideally avoided since it is likely
to reinforce pain behavior. The treatment aims to normalize
lifestyle (school attendance, extracurricular activities, sleep)
by benign negligence or distraction techniques. It is also
important to identify and reduce stress/triggers at home,
neighbourhood or with peers. Any form of secondary gain

should be minimized by preventing the child from using the
pain to avoid unpleasant but essential responsibilities. Diet
changes have little role in reducing pain, but a regular balanced
diet with adequate fibers must be insisted on. Though some
small studies have reported benefits, most do not show any
statistically significant difference between amitriptyline and
placebo in functional GI diseases in children. Interaction with
the teachers may help identify children with special needs
(specific learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity
disorders). They can be informed directly or through the
parents that they need to be sympathetic to the child while
not creating panic. Consultation with a psychiatrist is not
recommended unless there are compelling reasons to do so,
since it can affect the morale and outlook of the parents and
the child.

Clinical Pearl
What to tell the parents?
• The pain in functional abdominal pain is real, not imaginary.
Do not deny the presence of pain. The reassurance is only that
there is no organic basis.

Key points

Functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are the most
common cause of chronic abdominal pain in children

Approach to Global
Developmental Delay
Pratibha D Singhi, Naveen Sankhyan

DEFINITION
Global developmental delay (GDD) is an umbrella term
used to describe young children with developmental delay.
Conventionally, the term developmental delay is reserved for
children below 5 years of age. The term mental retardation
or more appropriately, “intellectual disability (ID)” is
usually applied to older children (>5 years), when intelligent
quotient testing is valid and reliable. Global developmental
delay implies a significant delay in two or more areas of
developmental performance: defined as gross⁄fine motor,
speech⁄language, cognition, social⁄personal, and activities of
daily living. Significant delay is defined as a developmental
level two standard deviations or more below the mean on ageappropriate, standardized, norm-referenced tests. Contrary to
popular use, GDD is not a diagnosis by itself and so it should
be used only as a basis for reaching a diagnosis. The prevalence
of intellectual disability is estimated to be around 1–3% of the
population.

APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIs
A systematic approach to a child with GDD will help in the
proper and optimum evaluation. The essential components of
the diagnostic evaluation of a child with GDD or intellectual
disability include the following:
• History: including prenatal and birth history, family
history, and construction of a pedigree of three generations
• Physical examination (special emphasis on dysmorphism):
neurologic examination, organomegaly
• Psychometric evaluation: to document and objectify the
functional level in various domains
• Laboratory tests: radiological evaluation (X-rays and
neuroimaging), genetic testing, metabolic tests, etc. as
indicated.

Ch-83.indd 392

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
History
The clinical assessment of a child with GDD/ID begins with a
thorough and directed history (Box 1).
A detailed history is essential to elicit antenatal and
perinatal risk factors for GDD/ID. The history should be
focused on maternal health during the first trimester of
pregnancy including fever, drug intake or toxin exposures,
and clues to intrauterine difficulties (oligohydramnios, preeclamptic toxemia, poor growth, antenatal bleeding, reduced
fetal movements, etc.). The timing and mode of delivery, birth
weight, APGAR scores, head circumference at birth, time to
independent feeding, and duration of postnatal hospital stay
are important objective markers of newborn health status.
One needs to remember that a history of delayed cry, although
an important clue is insufficient to conclude perinatal insult,
unless there is definite suggestion of neonatal encephalopathy
(e.g., excessive lethargy, seizures, and feeding difficulties
requiring orogastric/nasogastric feeding).

Box 1: Questions to be answered after history in a child with
global developmental delay/intellectual disability
•
•
•
•
•

Is it a static or progressive disorder?
Is there an obvious etiologic cause?
What is the timing of the possible underlying cause?
What is the developmental and functional level of the child?
What are the associated comorbid medical or behavioral
conditions (e.g., epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder)?
• In what socioeconomic and sociocultural milieu is the child
being raised?

11/21/2016 11:06:11 AM

Chapter 83: Approach to Global Developmental Delay

Clinical Pearl
• Remember that a history of delayed cry, although an important
clue is insufficient to conclude perinatal insult, unless there
is definite suggestion of neonatal encephalopathy (e.g.,
excessive lethargy, seizures, feeding difficulties requiring
orogastric/nasogastric feeding).

Postnatal insults such as neuroinfections are common in
the resource-poor countries and account for a large number
of children with acquired GDD/ID. A detailed developmental
history and past history should be elicited for presence
of seizures, hospitalizations, and other acute or chronic
conditions. A family history of ID can point toward a genetic
cause of GDD/ID, for example fragile-X syndrome or other
X-linked mental-retardation syndromes. Family history may
also point toward an unrecognized metabolic disorder such as
phenylketonuria.

Clinical Pearl
• A three-generation family history should be carefully elicited
in all children with developmental delay to unearth possible
inherited causes.

To recognize patterns of inheritance, it is essential that a
carefully elicited history is used to construct a three-generation
pedigree and identify consanguinity.

Examination
A child with GDD/ID evaluation with special focus on
dysmorphic features. Special attention is to be paid to the size
and shape of head, facies, eyes, stature, skin, hearing, hair, and
organomegaly. Any abnormalities in the head shape, sutures,
and fontanels should be noted. In children with abnormal
head size, head circumferences of both parents should be
obtained. The head circumference has to be assessed over a
period of time to understand the trajectory of head growth.
When a child is noted to have an unusual appearance,
a diagnosis is significantly more likely. Neurological
examination is important to identify cerebral palsy, muscletone abnormalities, weakness, paresis, ataxia, and other
specific neurological signs. A good physical examination,
particularly to look for organomegaly is also essential.
Such abnormalities on neurologic examination assist in
determining the need for additional investigations such as
electroencephalography, neuroimaging or molecular genetic
testing, or referral to other specialists such as psychologists,
or geneticists for further assessment.
The history and examination provide essential clues to the
diagnosis, which can be later confirmed by additional studies,
for example, in patients with Pradder‒Willi syndrome, the
history and examination may be contributory to the diagnosis
and the molecular genetic analysis confirms it.

Developmental Assessment
The clinical history should be supplemented with
standardized testing of developmental level by a clinical
psychologist. Standardized tools include screening tests
such as the Denver’s Development Screening Test, and the
Ages and Stages Questionnaire, and more detailed tests
such as the Gesell Development Schedules and the Bailey’s
Developmental Scales. When there is a concern about
developmental delay in a child, a developmental quotient
should be calculated for each developmental stream. It
is a means to simply express a developmental delay in
quantifiable terms. The “developmental quotient” is the ratio
of the child’s developmental age over the chronological age.
Typical development is a developmental quotient greater
than 70%, and atypical development is a developmental
quotient of less than 70%. The term GDD delay is used if a
child—younger than 5–6 years of age—has a developmental
quotient less than 70% in two or more domains.

Investigations
The choice and the sequence of investigations should be
guided by the clinical evaluation, cost of investigations, and
availability (Algorithm 1). Some investigations are a part of
complete evaluation (e.g., standardized vision, hearing testing,
ultrasound, and skeletal X-rays) while others tests offer means
to establish the diagnosis (genetic and metabolic testing).
In the absence of a universal thyroid screening in India,
thyroid function tests should be done in all children with
GDD/ID. Additionally, keeping in mind that large numbers
of children in resource-poor countries have acquired causes
for GDD/ID, it is prudent to opt for imaging studies as the
initial diagnostic testing. Magnetic resonance imaging is the
imaging modality of choice, given the higher resolution and
better resolution to pick up dysgenesis and white-matter
abnormalities.

Genetic Testing
It is preferable to involve experts in clinical genetics whenever
possible for the genetic evaluation of GDD/ID.

Cytogenetic Studies
Chromosome abnormalities are found in all categories of
intellectual disability, mild to profound and in both sexes.
The reported frequency of chromosomal anomalies detected
by high-resolution karyotyping (i.e., 550 bands) in patients
evaluated for intellectual disability or developmental delays is
around 10%. This test is reported to be a valuable initial test for
evaluation of GDD.

Fluorescent in situ Hybridization Testing (FISH)
About half of all structural chromosome abnormalities include
the telomere of the chromosome. Many of these abnormalities
may be missed by the standard karyotype. Fluorescent in situ

It is a better technique to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities.
It identifies deletions and/or duplications of chromosome
material with a high degree of sensitivity in a more efficient
manner than FISH techniques. Furthermore, the FISH test is
predominantly used to confirm a clinical diagnosis, whereas
aCGH does not require an expert clinician to suspect a specific
diagnosis. However, it is expensive and not available at most
centers in India.

Metabolic Testing (Box 2)
Both genetic testing and metabolic testing is expensive; hence its
judicious use is warranted. In such situations, it would be wise to
obtain an expert consultation before proceeding with these tests.

Approach to Psychomotor
Regression in Children
Anaita Udwadia Hegde, Omkar P Hajirnis

INTRODUCTION
Neurodevelopmental regression is often challenging to
clinicians in terms of diagnosis and management. The purpose
of this chapter is to outline a systematic approach to a child
presenting with suspected neurodevelopmental regression.
Reaching a specific diagnosis is of pivotal importance for
providing appropriate early therapy, prognosis, and genetic
counseling. Although the causes of psychomotor retardation
are individually rare, the combined estimate can be as high as
about 1 in 2,000 live births.

DEFINITION
Neuroregression is defined as loss of previously achieved
milestones in a previously healthy child with progressive
loss of speech, hearing, vision, locomotion, bulbar function,
and cognitive abilities. They are often associated with
seizures. It is also extended to a decrease in the normal rate
of acquisition of developmental milestones, followed by a
developmental plateau.

Clinical Approach
A history of loss of skills helps distinguish the neuro­
degenerative from static, nonprogressive conditions. The onset
may be insidious but is sometimes acute and may hence cause
diagnostic confusion. The regression may thereafter progress
at varying speeds or also have an intermittent plateauing of
milestones prior to the next period of deterioration, which may
be triggered by factors like viral infections. The presentations
can be varied from behavioral changes to recurrent seizures
mimicking epileptic encephalopathies. It is a dictum that
greater the genetic deficiency, earlier and more aggressive is
the presentation. Knowing the age at which signs first appear
helps enormously in narrowing the diagnosis. The diagnostic
process begins with a detailed family history as inheritance

Ch-84.indd 396

patterns are disease specific and a history of consanguinity is
especially important in autosomal recessive disorders.

Clinical Pearl
• It is important to differentiate between developmental delay
and developmental regression.

The four-step approach described below provides a useful
strategy for initial evaluation of patients with neurodegenerative
diseases:
• Identify the form of inheritance: autosomal recessive, auto­
somal dominant, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance
• Age at onset of regression: based on this, the disorders
can be divided into neonatal, infantile, late infantile, and
childhood or juvenile onset
• Determine from the history the predominant neuro­
anatomical system involved: gray matter, white matter,
basal ganglia, cerebellar, spinal cord, etc.
• Review other system involvements: involvement of skin,
liver, spleen, dysmorphic features, ophthalmic changes,
presence of seizures, peripheral neuropathy, etc.

Step 1: Inheritance
A detailed family tree or a pedigree chart helps to define
different modes of inheritance. The most common modality
of inheritance is autosomal recessive, seen commonly in
our circumstances due to high degree of consanguineous
marriages. It is important to note that mitochondrial disorders
can be inherited by maternally-transmitted modalities or an
autosomal pattern of inheritance. This is because mitochondria
contain two types of genetic material, namely mitochondrial
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which can only be passed on
from the mother and nuclear DNA which is passed on from
both parents. A few examples of neurodegenerative disorders
with their modes of inheritance are listed in the table 1.

acidosis and stroke like episodes

Step 2: Age of Onset
The age of onset of neuroregression helps us classify the
disorders. It goes without saying that the earlier the onset,
the more severe and progressive is the disorder. Those who
manifest late in childhood or adolescence usually have milder
symptoms and the progress is slower as compared to those who
manifest early and progress faster. Age of onset is divided into
neonatal (0–1 month), infantile (1–12 months), late infantile
(1–5 years), childhood (5–10 years), and adolescent or juvenile
onset (5–15 years).

Age-related Presentations
Neonatal onset (0–1 month): acute encephalopathy presents
early in life with recurrent vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy,
and dehydration. This suggests a gray matter involvement

Ch-84.indd 397

initially representing a toxic or intoxication encephalopathy.
Liver involvement may be evident in few disorders presenting
with jaundice, liver failure, and failure to thrive.
Infancy onset (1–12 months): onset at this age usually presents
with loss of interest in surroundings which can be either visual
or in nonverbal communication. The inability to roll over,
sit, use the hands in play, and vocalize suggests neurologic
difficulties at this age.
Late infantile age group onset (1–5 years): the changes noted in
this age group are more commonly in the speech and behavior
along with motor disabilities. They may exhibit clumsiness,
tremors, and gait abnormalities. They can present primarily
with seizures.
Juvenile age group onset (5–15 years): in disorders of
childhood and adolescence, the onset is more insidious and
the progression slower than in disorders appearing earlier.
Regression in this age group can present with seizures along
with deterioration of school performance, lack of new learning
skills, handwriting changes, poor concentration, and memory.

Step 3: Neuroanatomical Localization
The next most important feature to assess from the history and
examination is the onset of symptoms and progression to the
present state. The first sign or symptom of neuroregression
usually but not always gives a clue to the neuroanatomical
localization. For example, gait or motor regression at the onset
is suggestive of white matter pathologies, whereas seizures,
dementia, and cognitive decline is more suggestive of graymatter pathologies. Those who start with chorea, dystonia,
and involuntary movements suggest that the primary area
of involvement is the basal ganglia. Over a period of time,
symptoms evolve to involve multiple neuroanatomical sites;
for example, Krabbe’s disease starts with increase in tone or
loss of motor milestones suggestive of white matter pathology.
There may also have some dystonia, indicative of basal ganglia
involvement and over time, the child will become loose with
absent reflexes suggestive of additional peripheral neuronal
involvement.
Hence by careful history taking and detailed general and
nervous system examination, it is easier to determine which
pathways are involved and the range of diagnostic possibilities
is more easily circumscribed (Algorithm 2).

Clinical Pearl
• The first sign of neuroregression usually correlates best with
neuroanatomical localization.

Step 4: Identifying Associated
System/Organ Involvement
Multiple systems get involved with different degenerative
disorders. The physician needs to carefully screen other
associated systemic involvements beginning with a detailed
head-to-toe general examination. The examination should

begin with height, weight, and head-circumference measure­
ments. Many disorders eventually lead to acquired micro­cephaly
due to brain atrophy; others are noted for megalencephaly.
Dysmorphisms may be evident at birth or may be noted later as
the disorder manifests (Boxes 1 and 2).
A careful observation of the skin and hair and a full
assessment of the chest, abdomen, and extremities are part of
the examination (Tables 2 and 3).
A detailed ophthalmologic examination with fundoscopy
is pivotal and the various disorders associated with eye
abnormalities are listed in table 4.
Seizures may be a presenting complaint or may present as
the disease progresses. The age of onset and also the seizure
type provides useful information to arrive at the diagnosis
(Algorithm 3). The peripheral nervous system may be
involved in certain neurodegenerative disorders giving rise to
diminution or absence of deep-tendon reflexes and sensation
(Box 3).
Thus, all the features and clues mentioned above along with
a careful history and examination help to arrive at a diagnosis.
Each associated system needs to be examined in detail to be
able to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

INVESTIGATIONS
The investigations should cater to the common causes seen
in each age group and proceed from common to rarer causes.
All disorders that are potentially treatable or have genetic
implications should be screened in all cases. For example,
thyroid function tests should be done as hypothyroidism
can present with no obvious signs in infancy. Although
below mentioned is an exhaustive list of investigations, the
physician should prioritize from specific clues in the history

Ch-84.indd 399

and physical examination. The basic metabolic screen which
includes blood, urine, and sometimes the cerebrospinal fluid
examination should be done initially along with neuroimaging
[magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain] for suspected
metabolic disorders. More advanced tests should be prioritized
according to the condition suspected. Now genetic diagnosis is
the gold standard of diagnosis and wherever possible should
be attempted as it is useful not only for diagnosis but also for
future genetic counseling (Table 5).

The workup involves neuroimaging in most cases. Magnetic
resonance imaging with or without contrast is preferred over
computed tomography. It is useful for visualizing cerebral
malformations and for documenting the degree of cerebral
atrophy or white matter changes, such as those that occur
in various leukodystrophies. Magnetic resonance imaging
with contrast is ordered in suspected adrenoleukodystrophy,
Alexander’s disease, etc. Specific spectroscopy is useful in
mito­
chondrial disorders, Canavan’s disease, and creatine
deficiency. Increased N-acetylaspartate peak is detected in
Canavan’s disease, and in mitochondrial disorders a high
lactate peak may be found. Magnetic resonance imaging
with angiography is done in suspected Menke’s disease to
demonstrate tortuous vessels.

The specific cause of regression in childhood can be difficult to
elucidate and a large number of children remain undiagnosed.
It is essential to maintain the child’s quality of life and help

in supportive care. Careful attention to nutrition helps in
maintaining general well-being. Symptomatic treatment of
disturbed sleep, behavior and mood disturbances should be
done. A small number of disorders have specific treatment and
maximum effort should be made to diagnose these conditions.
They can be enumerated as in the box 4.
Bone marrow transplantation has been tried in various
disorders and has shown promise when it has been done at
a stage where irreparable brain damage has not occurred.
This includes lysosomal storage disorders, metachromatic
leukodystrophy, Gaucher’s disease, mucopolysaccharidosis,
and adrenoleukodystrophy.
Every effort should be made to prevent the family from
having another affected child with the help of antenatal
screening.

ANTENATAL TESTING AND COUNSELING
Having an accurate genetic diagnosis helps immensely for
genetic counseling and antenatal testing. A clear explanation
of the inheritance pattern will clear up misunderstandings in
the family about who is “at fault”. Once a genetic diagnosis is
made, this should be used to screen other family members.
This is especially important for younger, as yet asymptomatic,
siblings who might benefit greatly from specific therapies if
these are instituted prior to the development of symptoms or
in the early symptomatic period.

Clinical Pearl
• Every effort should be taken to diagnose treatable causes of
psychomotor regression.

The following is an algorithmic flowchart to aid the
physician in approaching a child with psychomotor regression.
However, significant overlaps exist and also disorders with
atypical presentations can confuse the physician. A systematic
clinical approach with a sound theoretical knowledge helps in
reducing the investigative burden on the patient.

Key points

Approach to a Child
with First Seizure
Anju Aggarwal, Anaita Udwadia Hegde

INTRODUCTION
In 2005, a Task Force of the International League Against
Epilepsy (ILAE) formulated conceptual definition of a “seizure”
where an epileptic seizure is defined as a transient occurrence
of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or
synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.
Epilepsy was defined as a disorder of the brain characterized
by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures.
This definition is usually practically applied as having two
unprovoked seizures more than 24-hours apart. A seizure that
is provoked by a transient factor acting on an otherwise normal
brain to temporarily lower the seizure threshold, does not
count toward a diagnosis of epilepsy. However, conceptually,
epilepsy also exists after at least one unprovoked seizure, when
there is high risk for another, although the actual required risk
is debatable.
The term “provoked seizure” is considered being synonymous
with a “reactive seizure” or an “acute symptomatic seizure”.

Box 1: Operational (practical) clinical definition of epilepsy
Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following
conditions:
• At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 hours
apart
• One unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further
seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after
two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years
• Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome
• Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had
an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the
applicable age or those who have remained seizure-free for the
last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years

Risk of Recurrence after First Status Epilepticus
•
•

The recurrence risk after a prolonged event or status
epilepticus is the same as that of a brief seizure.
However, if they do recur they have a higher chance of
getting a repeat status epilepticus.

NEWER DEFINITIONS

Clinical Pearls

In the need to address circumstances with high risk for
future seizures after a first unprovoked seizure, the ILAE
commissioned a Task Force in December 2013 to formulate an
operational definition of epilepsy for the purposes of clinical
diagnosis (Box 1).

STATISTICS
About 2–5% of children experience a seizure one time or the
other in their lifetime. This includes both febrile and afebrile
seizures. After a single unprovoked seizure, risk for another is
40–52%. With two unprovoked nonfebrile seizures, the chance
by 4 years of having another is 73%, with a 95% confidence
interval (CI) of 59–87%, subsequently herein portrayed as
approximately 60–90%.

Ch-85.indd 404

• If an event is ambiguous, it is better to wait for a recurrence for
clarification
• Misdiagnosis of an “epileptic” seizure may be more stigmatizing
than a delayed diagnosis of epilepsy.

Clinical Evaluation after a First
Seizure in a Child
Whenever a child comes with first episode of seizure, what we
need to know is:
• Is it a seizure or other events which mimic seizures?
• What is the type of seizure?
• What is the possible etiology?
• What investigations are required?
• Does he or she require therapy?
• Prognosis in terms of recurrence of seizure or remission of
epilepsy?

HISTORY
A good clinical history is what is going to help us decide the
type of seizure and distinguish it from nonepileptic events.
Best is to elicit history from the care taker or parent who has
witnessed the seizure. If not possible, history should be elicited
again after the initial control of seizure activity.
Questions that need to be addressed are:
• What was the child doing when he had a seizure?
• What happened in intricate detail?
• Did the eyes turn to one side?
• Did the child become stiff?
• Did the child have clonic movements or jerks or just brief
flickering of eyes?
• How long the seizure did last?
• Was the child unconscious after that and for how long?
• Did the child experience any weakness of any limb after the
seizure?
• Did the child pass urine and stool during the episode?
• Did the child suffer any injury during the seizure?

Ch-85.indd 405

History should include a detailed antenatal history of
mother, birth history, and developmental history to find out
any associated risk factors or etiology of seizures.

EXAMINATION
In addition to the vitals including a blood pressure reading
and general physical examination, one should look for neuro­
cutaneous markers, microcephaly, dysmorphic features, and
signs of raised intracranial pressure. Detailed neurological
examination is required to detect neurological deficit, altered
sensorium and meningeal signs should be looked for.

Clinical Pearl
• Determination of type of seizure and distinction from
nonepileptic events is best done by clinical history (preferably
from the person who has witnessed the seizure).

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of seizures can range from a variety
of clinical presentations. Understanding the occurrence and
nature of minor events is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis.
These are principally:
• Loss of awareness
• Generalized convulsive movements
• Drop attacks
• Transient focal motor attacks
• Transient focal sensory attacks
• Facial muscle and eye movements
• Psychic experiences
• Aggressive or vocal outbursts
• Episodic phenomena in sleep
• Prolonged confusional or fugue states.
Some of the common differential diagnoses are described
below:

Syncope with Secondary Jerking Movements
People who faint often have small, brief myoclonic twitches
of the extremities which can be prominent with prolonged
cerebral hypoperfusion.

Nonepileptic Attack Disorder
Nonepileptic attack disorder (NEAD), previously known as
pseudo­seizures typically gives rise to episodes of two broad types:
1. Attacks involving motor phenomena
2. Attacks of lying motionless.
A child with NEAD will have a seizure-like-episode only
during the awake state, may remember the sequence of events
well, will not have any injury during seizure, may have family
history of seizure and may not have seizure-like-movements of
any particular seizure type. They may talk during the seizure
like activity, usually will not have cyanosis or incontinence.
They usually do not have any postictal changes. Seizure can be
precipitated or mimicked on suggestion.

Breath Holding Spells

•

Children of breath-holding-spells will have seizure like activity
only during awake period when the child is not attended ,
usually not followed by neurological deficit; may be associated
with anemia, usually seem to occur in children less than 2 years.

Sleep Disorders
At times sleep disorders as night terrors mimic seizures
usually seen in children 4–8 years of age. Child wakes up with
sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, fear, and anxiety. They
do not remember the event. These are usually self-limiting.
Nightmares occur in children 5–12 years, who suddenly get up
during rapid eye movement sleep with an unpleasant dream;
they have autonomic activity and are able to describe the event.

Clinical Pearl

Primary Cardiac or Respiratory Abnormalities
Presenting with Secondary Anoxic Seizures

• A normal electroencephalogram does not rule out and an
abnormal electroencephalogram does not prove epilepsy; it is
only a supportive investigation.

Episodes of complete heart block may have syncopal features
followed by collapse and secondary anoxic seizures. Usually
the attacks last for less than 1 minute.

Involuntary Movement Disorders and Other
Neurological Conditions
There is no alteration in consciousness. Some of the common
examples include paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis,
idiopathic torsion dystonia, etc.

Hyperekplexia
Attacks are characterized by excessive startle, may cause
stiffening, and collapse with a sudden jerk of all four limbs.
Attacks are provoked by sudden unexpected stimuli, usually
auditory. Hyperekplexia needs to be distinguished from
seizures induced by startle.

ROLE OF INVESTIGATIONS
Investigations after first unprovoked seizure:
• Routine labs: complete blood counts, serum electrolytes,
blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, glucose, calcium,
and magnesium based on individual clinical circum­
stances—based on suggestive history, clinical findings or
failure to return to baseline alertness
• Lumbar puncture: nonfebrile seizure does not warrant a
lumbar puncture
{{ In less than 6-months-old or with persistent alteration
of alertness and meningeal signs, lumbar puncture
should be performed
• Electroencephalogram is recommended as part of the
diagnostic evaluation of a child with a first unprovoked
seizure, preferably 5–7 days after the seizure

Neuroimaging
Emergency imaging:
–– Computed tomography (CT) Scan is equally
effective as magnetic resonance imaging
–– Child of any age who experiences postictal focal
deficit not resolving/not returned to baseline after
many hours
–– Suspicion of structural lesion
{{ Nonemergency imaging:
–– Magnetic resonance imaging is routinely much
better for all epilepsies
–– Some indications for CT scan especially in our
country where cost is a major issue.
{{

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
•
•

Treatment with antiepileptic drugs is not indicated for the
prevention of epilepsy after the first unprovoked seizure
Treatment is considered in circumstances where the
benefit of reducing risk of second seizure outweighs the
risk of pharmacologic and psychosocial side effects.

Clinical Pearl
• Treatment decision is made depending on the risk of
recurrence of seizure in a particular situatio.

COUNSELING AND
EMERGENCY HOME MANAGEMENT
Education of the child and parents about seizures, epilepsy
and, medication plays an important part in reducing the
emotional stress on the family. Providing the child and
family with written material on epilepsy and antiepileptic
medications can be very helpful.
It is important to review appropriate seizure precautions
with the family, including proper positioning of a child during
a seizure and issues regarding water safety and driving. The
parents and other care givers can be taught the emergency
management of a seizure when prolonged beyond 3–4 minutes
with usage of intranasal or buccal midazolam or rectal
diazepam as per the age and weight of the child.
The following is an algorithmic approach (Algorithm 1) to
management of a first unprovoked seizure in a child.

Key points

))
Simple febrile seizures do not require any investigates as
magnetic resonance imaging or electroencephalogram (EEG).
Investigations as to the cause of fever should be carried out
))
First nonfebrile seizure requires a detailed clinical evaluation,
electroencephalogram, and neuroimaging whenever possible
))
There is no long-term difference if treated after the first or
second seizure
))
Antiepileptic drug treatment is not usually started after a first
unprovoked seizure, unless the clinical or EEG features suggest
a high risk of recurrence
))
Patient education is perhaps the most important and often
neglected aspect of management of seizures and hence needs
to be stressed on when explaining to the care givers.

Medical Management of Epilepsy
Veena Kalra, Omkar P Hajirnis

•

INTRODUCTIOn
The aim is restoration of normal life through complete seizure
control with minimal or no drug side effects. It is imperative
to develop a management algorithm based on knowledge
of the epilepsy disease, likely outcome, and rational use of
antiepileptic drugs.
The basic steps in management of epilepsy are as follows:
• Differentiate a seizure from nonseizure event
• Identify cause of seizures and distinguish provoked seizure
• Diagnose epilepsy and epilepsy syndrome
• Distinguish benign and severe epilepsy syndromes.

Third antiepileptic drug: an additional 1–3% will become
seizure free.
Thus, after three first-line-antiepileptic drugs, a maximum
of 66% will be seizure free.
• With two antiepileptic drugs together: 3% more will be
seizure free
• With three antiepileptic drugs together: no additional
benefit seen.
Thus, about 30% of patients by definition will fall under
“intractable epilepsy”.

Clinical Pearl

Clinical Pearls
• The first step in approaching a child with seizure disorder is to
determine whether the event in the patient is truly a seizure
or not
• It is surprising to note that many other paroxysmal events are
misdiagnosed as seizures and the consequences of this can be
disastrous.

DEFINITIONS
First-line-antiepileptic drug: it is a drug internationally
recognized as appropriate treatment for pediatric epilepsy as
monotherapy.
Add-on-antiepileptic drug: it is a drug recognized inter­
nationally as appropriate for treatment of pediatric epilepsy
not as monotherapy but in addition to another already existing
antiepileptic drug.

STATISTICS
•
•

Ch-86.indd 408

First antiepileptic drug: will make 50% of children seizure
free
Second antiepileptic drug: an additional 15% will become
seizure free

• Children with treatment-resistant epilepsy are defined as “failure
of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and
used antiepileptic-drug schedules (whether as monotherapies
or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom”.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRST SEIZURE
•

The first seizure is not designated epilepsy and manage­
ment approach is to treat the seizure and identify its cause
• The first generalized seizure may not recur in 50–60% cases.
Anticonvulsant therapy, is therefore, not indicated for the
first generalized seizure
• Predicts high recurrence risk (80%) in symptomatic
seizures and in patients with abnormal electro­
encephalogram (EEG) versus a 40% risk with a normal
EEG.
Anticonvulsant therapy is started after the first episode in the
following situations:
• If first seizure is a partial seizure—it merits anticonvulsant
therapy as the recurrence risk is high (60–80%) and it may
be symptomatic
• Examples of first seizures which merit treatment are
myoclonic seizures and absence attacks
• Acute symptomatic seizures, e.g., ring-enhancing lesions,
etc.

Chapter 86: Medical Management of Epilepsy

Indications of Electroencephalogram
Electroencephalogram is recommended as part of the
diagnostic evaluation of a child with a first unprovoked seizure,
preferably 5–7 days after the seizure.
Table 1 highlights the clinical usefulness of an EEG in
epilepsy management.

•
•
•
•
•

Identifiable unilateral structural lesions on MRI
Hemiatrophy due to congenital, perinatal, or acquired causes
Tumors
Suspected Rasmussen’s encephalitis
Conditions listed for ketogenic diet.
The above conditions require early referral to specialized
centers.

Neuroimaging
Conventional radiography has no place in epilepsy
management. Magnetic resonance imaging scan with epilepsy
protocol is the preferred modality. It is far superior to computed
tomography scan for epileptogenic lesion identification,
focal cortical dysplasias, etc. and thus helps to distinguish
symptomatic epilepsies of partial/generalized nature from
idiopathic epilepsy. In intractable epilepsy, advanced MRI
techniques, volumetric evaluation of hippocampi, etc. are
useful. However, a large number of epilepsies do not require
neuroimaging, e.g., absence attacks.
Functional scans like positron emission tomography/singlephoton emission computed tomography scans are useful in
presurgical evaluation of patients in addition to MRI scans.

WHEN TO LOOK BEYOND ANTIEPILEPTICs
•

If patient has a clear-cut, well-defined focal cortical
dysplasia—surgery is best option

• Helps to take therapy decision,
identify nonconvulsive status

• Monitoring of status

nonconvulsive status

• EEGs essential for diagnosis of
epilepsy syndromes

• Underlying disease state

• May point to metabolic/
genetic basis of epilepsy

DRUG TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY
How to Start Treatment
•
•

Start low, go slow
Reach maximum dose/side effects before you discard the
drug
• Dosage to ideally once-a-day or twice-a-day
• Adjust to the child’s daily activity
• Add a second (first-line-drug); achieve control; then try
and taper off the first antiepileptic drug
• If seizure frequency is decreased but not stopped after the
first antiepileptic drug, add a second drug; use rational
polytherapy.
The following logistic approach provides a simple clinical
approach to drug for the treatment of epilepsy:

How to Choose the First Drug?
Start with the correct “first line” antiepileptic drug. “Correct”—
good efficacy (effectiveness) and low on side-effects
(tolerability).
Efficacy is the time to “repeat seizure” after starting the
drug while tolerability is the time to “withdrawal” due to
ineffectiveness or side-effects.

Clinical Pearls
• Effectiveness = Efficacy + Tolerability
• When two drugs are equally effective, tolerability is the
deciding factor.

Table 2 provides a useful guide to choose and start the
appropriate first-line antiepileptic drug. However, the decision
regarding specific drug depends upon the age, seizure type,
side effects, cost, and life style of the patient.

Clinical Pearl
• Whenever in doubt as to seizure type or syndrome, sodium
Valproate is the best first choice for first-line therapy

Table 3 enumerates the dosing guidelines for the various
commonly used antiepileptic drugs.

Do I Use an Established Antiepileptic Drug or
Try a Newer Antiepileptic Drug?
Evidence-based medicine proves that the efficacy is similar
in most first-line antiepileptic drugs, new or old. Thus, it is
important to choose your drug by identifying the seizure
type and knowing the common side effects of the drug in
relation to your patient.

include drowsiness, dizziness, nystagmus, cognitive decline,
gastrointestinal dysfunction, etc.

Specific side effects
•
•
•
•

Ch-86.indd 410

Carbamazepine: diplopia, dizziness, cognition, or counts
Sodium valproate: weight gain, hair loss, or liver dysfunction

drowsy, ataxia, cognition, or nausea—toxic range
Phenobarbitone: drowsiness, cognitive decline, ataxia,
withdrawal seizures

•
•
•
•
•

Lamotrigine: rash with danger of Stevens-Johnsons

Topiramate: weight loss, cognition issues, or incontinence,
hypohidrosis leading to pyrexia
Vigabatrin: visual field cuts
Levetiracetam: mood swings, or drowsiness
Benzodiazepine: drowsiness, low tone, or tolerance.

What do I do if there is no Response to
First-line Antiepileptic Drug?
•
•

Firstly use all tests available to confirm the seizure type
Choose a drug with a different mechanism of action to your
first-line antiepileptic drug.
The following drug combinations are effective and
recommended:
• Valproate + Lamotrigine
• Topiramate + Carbamazepine
• Topiramate + Valproate
• Valproate + Carbamazepine
• Carbamazepine + Phenytoin
Identify an epileptic syndrome and choose a drug known
to work on the identified syndrome.
Table 4 and 5 lists the various epileptic syndromes and the
preferred drugs for the same.
It is prudent to remember some antiepileptic drugs are
known to worsen certain epilepsies. Table 6 depicts the drugs
to avoid in certain epilepsies.

DISCONTINUATION OF
ANTIEPILEPTIC THERAPY
Epilepsy therapy need not be life-long in most subjects. In
most epilepsies, the antiepileptic drug is withdrawn after
2 years of seizure-free period. However, about 20–29%
subjects relapse after antiepileptic drugs withdrawal. Drug
withdrawal is over 3–6 months and is one drug at a time in
cases of polytherapy. When withdrawing on abnormal EEGs,
adolescent epilepsies or remote symptomatic epilepsies
adequate counseling is required to parents and patient with
regards to chances of relapse.
Algorithm 1 depicts the approach to withdrawing anti­
epileptic drugs.

DRUG MONITORING

Clinical Pearls

Therapeutic range is the optimum level of a drug in the body
which is effective, but not toxic. However, there are wide
variations in blood levels are observed at the same dosage in
different patients. Also, there is no correlation between efficacy
and toxicity of the antiepileptic drug in the blood for a given
patient. There is also a difference between total drug and free
drug in the system—total is what is being tested, free is what is
effective.
Timing of collection is most important as the trough levels
are determined for efficacy and peak levels for toxicity (Table 7).

Follow-up: appropriate timely drug withdrawal.

Lifestyle
•
•
•
•
•

Maintain a normal healthy lifestyle
No food restrictions needed
School teachers should be informed

Caution is advocated in dangerous activities such as cycling,
swimming. and fire particularly during early therapy.

Clinical Pearl
• Domiciliary management of seizures is extremely important
and should be taught to every family
• Facility of intranasal midazolam should be available in all schools

))
After a second unprovoked seizure, the chances of a third
unprovoked seizure are 80–90% within 2 years if treatment
is not initiated. Therefore, treatment after the second (rather
than the first) unprovoked seizure is recommended
))
The choice of antiepileptic drug in treating the childhood
epilepsies will be determined by the epilepsy syndrome (and
hence the specific seizures help to define the syndrome), side
effects profile and, to an extent, its ease of use (formulation
and dosing regimen)
))
Sodium valproate appears to remain the most effective
antiepileptic drug in treating most seizure types
))
It is important to be aware of drugs that may exacerbate some
seizure types
))
The temptation should be strongly resisted to indulge in
polytherapy, as it is always easier to add another drug than to
withdraw one
))
There are no convincing data that the simultaneous use of
three antiepileptic drugs results in better seizure control than
two drugs
))
In order to assess response to treatment, information on
baseline seizure frequency and intervals between initial
seizures is crucial. Tracking response to seizures is important,
either with paper diaries or with online seizure-tracking tools
))
A trial of epilepsy medication discontinuation is usually
recommended after 2 seizure-free years. Medications should
be discontinued over at least a 6-week period, and if the
patient is on polytherapy, only one medication should be
weaned at a given time
))
Children with pharmacologically-resistant epilepsy and
seizures due to focal abnormalities are potential candidates
for epilepsy surgery.

SUGGESTED READINGS

FOLLOW-UP
Initially after 6 weeks and then 3 monthly if seizures are
controlled. Refer to a higher center if:
• Uncontrolled seizures/side effects
• Suspected syndromes
• Suspected inborn errors of metabolism
• Deteriorating cognition
• Fresh neurological deficits.

Key points

Approach to Refractory Epilepsies
Neelu A Desai, Vrajesh Udani

INTRODUCTION
Drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) or intractable or pharmaco­
resistant epilepsy is epilepsy which does not successfully
respond to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. About onethird of children with newly diagnosed epilepsy are likely
to subsequently develop drug resistant epilepsy which has
tremendous implications not only on the child but also on the
patient’s family members and care givers. Aggressiveness in
the diagnosis and treatment of medically refractory epilepsy
in children is imperative given the adverse effect of recurrent
seizures on early brain development, learning, and memory.

DEFINITION
Conventionally, therapeutic failure of three AEDs defined
intractability. Frequency, duration, and severity of seizures are
less commonly included in definition of DRE. The International
League against Epilepsy defines DRE as failure of adequate
trials of two well-tolerated and appropriately chosen and used
AED schedules (monotherapies or in combination) to achieve
sustained seizure freedom.

International League against Epilepsy
Definition of Drug Refractory Epilepsy
Failure of adequate trials of two well-tolerated and
appropriately chosen and used AED schedules (mono­therapies
or in combination), to achieve sustained seizure freedom.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Incidence and prevalence of DRE is uncertain due to
unstandardized definitions as well as misdiagnoses. Almost 20–
40% of epilepsy cases become medically resistant. Data from
various studies on DRE reveal that with the first drug-trial, 50%
patients would become seizure-free. A second medicationtrial produced remission in an additional 13%, while with the
third drug, only a further 4% would become seizure-free.

Ch-87.indd 414

Clinical Pearl
• Appropriately chosen first antiepileptic drug will control half
the cases of new-onset epilepsy while only one-third of these
will be drug resistant.

WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF
Drug-refractory epilepsy?
Recurrent seizures are associated with a range of deleterious
consequences including death. Uncontrolled epilepsy in
infants and children has deleterious effect on early brain
development, learning, and memory. Refractory seizures
restrict patients’ social activities, academic achievements
and in adults reduce the ability to hold a driving license or
keep a job. It is a great economic burden for society through
expenditures in health-care and unemployment. Patients
with epilepsy have a mortality rate significantly higher than
that of the general population. Sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 8–17% of deaths in people
with epilepsy.

COMPLICATIONS OF Drugrefractory epilepsy
•
•
•
•
•

Mortality: underlying neurological disorder, status
epilepticus, seizure-related accidents; treatment-related
deaths, SUDEP
Morbidity: increased cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric
problems

Chapter 87: Approach to Refractory Epilepsies

RISK FACTORS OF Drugrefractory epilepsy
A number of prospective studies have attempted to identify
factors that predict the risk of true DRE. Some of these factors
are as follows:
• The response to the first AED trial has been found as the
most consistent and vital predictive factor for DRE. As
mentioned before, half of patients with new-onset epilepsy
respond to the first appropriate AED prescribed. With
subsequent AED trial, less than 20% are likely to respond.
High seizure frequency prior to treatment is consistently
identified risk factor for DRE
• Etiology of epilepsy and syndrome classification is also a
relevant factor deciding prognosis. Idiopathic syndromes
have a better prognosis than symptomatic/cryptogenic
epilepsy syndromes. Certain pediatric epilepsy syndromes
that are usually medically intractable include early
(neonatal) myoclonic encephalopathy, early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, etc.
• Other variables such as electroencephalographic (EEG)
findings and the presence or absence of psychiatric
comorbidities have been correlated with outcomes in
some analyses
• Some findings such as status epilepticus, a long duration
of epilepsy, a family history of epilepsy, and febrile
convulsions are variable determinants of prognosis. Some
studies have also identified an abnormal neurologic
examination and/or developmental delay/intellectual
disability as risk factors for DRE
• Some studies, but not all, suggest that age at presentation
may be a factor in the development of DRE. Some pediatric
studies have found that seizure onset in later childhood
or adolescence appears more likely to be associated with
DRE than seizures with onset between the ages of 5 and
10 years. One series found onset in the neonatal timeperiod associated with DRE.

Predictors of True
Drug-Refractory Epilepsy
•
•
•

Lack of efficacy with first appropriate AED
High number of seizures prior to treatment
Underlying etiology: symptomatic/cryptogenic rather than
idiopathic epilepsy syndrome

•

Others: early age of onset, abnormal development/
neurological examination, EEG abnormality, presence of
status epilepticus, and comorbidities.

DIfFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Pseudorefractory Epilepsy
Very often in practice, medical intractability is not true. This
apparent treatment failure which is not true intractability
could be due to:
• Wrong diagnosis: some paroxysmal events appear like
seizures but are not due to abnormal electrical discharges.
They could be physiological or psychogenic in nature
and do not respond to AEDs. Video EEG is a golden tool
to prove or disprove them. In one study almost 20% of
patients seen at epilepsy referral centers were nonepileptic
attack disorder (NEAD). Some common seizure mimics
are mentioned in the table 1.
• Wrong choice of drug: inappropriate drug selection
is often responsible for intractability. For example, a
narrow-spectrum AED like carbamazepine can worsen
seizure frequency in generalized epilepsy, e.g., absence or
myoclonic jerks
• Wrong dosage: inappropriate dosages and frequency can
also lead to pseudo refractoriness. For example, giving
short half-life AEDs, e.g., syrup carbamazepine in once or
twice daily-doses.
• Wrong lifestyle: recreational drug or alcohol abuse, sleep
deprivation or noncompliance and self-adjustment of drug
doses can also lead to improper seizure control.

MANAGEMENT OF
Drug-refractory epilepsy
The treatment of children with medically intractable epilepsy
is both challenging and rewarding. True refractory epilepsy
needs referral to a Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center for
optimal evaluation and management. This comprises of a
pediatric neurologist/epileptologist, electrophysiologist,
epilepsy surgeon, neuropsychologist, and counselor.
If initial history, examination, and videos suggest pseudorefractoriness, appropriate steps should be taken to resolve
them. This would include discontinuing AEDs in NEAD and
counseling.

Section 11: Neurology

Antiepileptic Drugs
Medical management with AEDs remains the first-line
treatment in patients with epilepsy. A good number of patients
respond to small changes in treatment like switching to
appropriate monotherapy according to seizure/syndrome,
increasing dose, frequency, and assuring strict compliance.
Rational polytherapy is recommended in nonresponders to
monotherapy, e.g., synergistic combinations like valproate
and lamotrigine; AEDs with different mechanisms of action
like a sodium channel blocker carbamazepine with a gammaaminobutyric acid ergic drug like clobazam. Tapering drugs like
carbamazepine in generalized epilepsies is rewarding. Drug
levels may sometimes help in adjustment of drug dosages.

Seizure Diary
A seizure diary is a very helpful tool in all patients with DRE
to document seizure frequency and intensity with specific
interventions, e.g., a new AED. This improves drug compliance
and helps to identify triggers like menstrual cycle, etc. It often
would help to avoid unnecessary polytherapy with ineffective
AEDs and identify scenarios where the AED itself leads to
paradoxical increase in seizures.

Clinical Pearl
• Seizure diary is an essential tool kept by patient or caregivers of
drug-refractory epilepsy, recording frequency and intensity of
seizures along with antiepileptic drugs and precipitants.

As mentioned before, of the 30–40% of individuals
with DRE about half will continue their seizures despite
three appropriate drugs being tried to their full therapeutic
potential. Though new AEDs have undoubtedly reduced drug
interactions and adverse effects the number of DRE patients
who become seizure free after the first 2–3 drugs is not more
than 5%. These patients should be evaluated for possibility of
epilepsy surgery, ketogenic diet, or vagal nerve stimulation.

Clinical Pearl
• Drug-refractory epilepsy represents a significant portion
of all pediatric epilepsies and should be referred early to a
Comprehensive Epilepsy Center where all treatment options
including epilepsy surgery and the ketogenic diet are available
for optimal management.

Epilepsy Surgery

416

Surgery has the potential of altering the natural history of
epilepsy by improving or eliminating seizures in carefully
selected patients. Epilepsy surgery should be considered early
in appropriate patients with DRE when seizures are sufficiently
frequent or severe as to significantly disrupt the patient’s
quality of life.
Presurgical evaluation would need video-EEG monitoring
and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
brain in all cases. The sensitivity of MRI can be substantially

Ch-87.indd 416

improved by an epilepsy protocol with spoiled gradient
sequences to delineate subtle malformations of cortical
development like focal cortical dysplasias which often
underlie refractory epilepsy. Functional neuroimaging like
ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
can help delineate the ictal onset zone and often complements
MRI in the search of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), critical
for planning any surgical intervention. Similarly, positron
emission tomography (PET) is very useful as a tool to map
out glucose metabolism in the interictal state as many EZs are
hypometabolic. Post-processing techniques coregistering MRI
and functional images enhance the information. Another very
important consideration in presurgical evaluation is defining
the eloquent cortex for sensorimotor, language, and visual
functions. If this overlaps with the EZ, postoperative deficits
may be unacceptable (Algorithm 1).
Neuropsychological evaluations help understand the
specific cognitive defects a patient has, e.g., verbal or visual
memory deficits in hippocampal sclerosis when planning
surgery in older children and teenagers.
Surgical options in DRE are either resective or palliative
epilepsy surgery.
Resective epilepsy surgery has the best-established efficacy
for individuals with lesional epilepsy. Patients with concordant
abnormalities on MRI, EEG, SPECT, and PET have a rate of
seizure remission as high as 90%.
Disconnective surgery is sometimes employed for palliative
treatment in children with catastrophic epilepsy syndromes
with no resectable lesion (Table 2).

Ketogenic Diet
Ketogenic diet (high-fat, low protein) in children with DRE is
an effective therapy with more than one-third experiencing a
50% or greater reduction in seizures. Behavioral improvement
is often an additional bonus. It is tried for about 3 months
and if effective, is continued for 2–3 years. Less restrictive
modifications like the modified Atkins diet can be used in older
children, though with less success (Table 3).

Vagus Nerve Stimulation
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been approved for
adjunctive treatment of DRE in adults and children over
Table 2: Resective surgery (curative) and disconnective surgery

Resective surgery (curative)
• Children with recognized
resectable lesions (FCD, MTS) and

12 years of age. Approximately 30–40% of patients achieve
a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Serious
adverse events are rare.
Vagus nerve stimulation is efficacious in patients with
well-documented DRE, who are not candidates for intracranial
surgery, or whose seizures were not benefitted by prior epilepsy
surgery. In resectable lesions, resective surgery is preferred
over VNS because of the greater potential for complete seizure
remission (Algorithm 2).

Acute Flaccid Paralysis
V Viswanathan, Padma Balaji

INTRODUCTIOn
Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is something that most pediatric
neurologists see on a regular basis particularly during certain
seasons (mostly during the winter seasons) although they
seem to occur most of the year round. These children, who are
previously healthy, develop weakness in both legs to start with
and then progressing to involve the breathing muscles quickly
over a few hours to days. They then develop difficulties in
swallowing and invariably end up getting admitted to hospital.
In some cases, they may follow mild upper respiratory illnesses
or fever.
World health organization defines AFP syndrome as
“characterized by rapid onset of weakness of an individual’s
extremities, often including weakness of the muscles of
respiration and swallowing, progressing to maximum severity
within 1–10 days. The term ‘flaccid’ indicates the absence of
spasticity or other signs of disordered central nervous system
(CNS) motor tracts such as hyper-reflexia, clonus, or extensor
plantar responses”.

Chapter 88: Acute Flaccid Paralysis

Acute Inflammatory Polyradiculo­
neuropathy (Guillain-Barre Syndrome)
This is one of the most common causes of AFP in children.
Peripheral nerves are the target of an abnormal immune
response. In most cases, there is a history of an antecedent
viral infection. Commonest viral infection that precipitates
this is usually respiratory infection, although in some
gastrointestinal infections may be the cause. Enteritis caused
by specific strains of Campylobacter jejuni is more often
the cause of the acute axonal form of GBS, rather than the
demyelinating variety.
The clinical presentation is usually with progressive motor
weakness involving more than one limb—usually the legs.
Mild sensory symptoms are usually present characterized
by dysesthesia and muscle tenderness in the limbs. The
weakness progresses to reach a nadir by about 2–3 weeks.
Deep tendon reflexes are absent in all the weak muscles.
Bilateral facial weakness occurs in about half of the children.
Autonomic dysfunction like arrhythmia, labile blood pressure
and gastrointestinal dysfunction may be seen. Respiratory
involvement is not uncommon in this condition during the

initial progressive phase of the illness and so needs close
monitoring and appropriate intervention.
Recovery usually begins about 2–3 weeks after the progres­
sion stops and is usually complete in most children but takes
even as much as 2–3 months in some cases. The prognosis is
best when recovery begins early and also in children with the
demyelinating variety rather than the axonal type.
Diagnosis is best with the help of nerve-conduction studies
which will help to distinguish the axonal variety from the
demyelinating type. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination
during the second week may show mild elevation in CSF
protein and a few mononuclear leukocytes (usually <10).
Management is primarily supportive with careful
monitoring for respiratory function and adequate support
including ventilation in some during the initial phase. Plasma
exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin hastens the
recovery of GBS. Although, we have discussed so much about
differential diagnosis in most cases once we have a good
reliable history and clinical examination findings, diagnosis is
clear, cut and management is straight forward.
All cases of AFP should be notified in the appropriate form
to the corporation health officials as it is mandatory that we

Approach to Floppy Infant
Vrajesh Udani, Sarbani S Raha

INTRODUCTION

Box 1: Salient points in history-taking
• Consanguineous marriage
• Reduced fetal movements
• Feeding difficulty in
neonatal period

Floppiness or hypotonia is a common neurologic symptom
in infancy. Hypotonia may be secondary to diseases
involving brain, spinal cord, nerve, or muscle. Hence, a
systematic approach is must while evaluating a floppy infant
to avoid ordering many investigations and to reach a proper
diagnosis.
Weak infants always have hypotonia but it may exist
without weakness.

EXAMINATION OF A HYPOTONIC INFANT
•

DEFINITION
Hypotonia is an impairment of the ability to sustain postural
control and movement against gravity. Floppy infants exhibit
poor control of movements, delayed motor skills, and
hypotonic motor movement patterns.
Phasic tone is a rapid contraction in response to a highintensity stretch. Postural tone is the prolonged contraction of
antigravity muscles in response to the low-intensity stretch of
gravity. The maintenance of normal tone requires intact central
and peripheral nervous system.
A hypotonic infant needs to be evaluated adequately. A
detailed history and neurological examination would help
us to differentiate between central hypotonia of upper motor
neuron origin and motor unit disorders.
Infants who show delay in all aspects of development and
have other evidence of brain dysfunction like abnormal eye
movements or seizures, dysmorphic features or exaggerated
deep-tendon reflexes probably have a central cause of
hypotonia. On the other hand, an alert and active infant who
has significant motor weakness and absent deep-tendon
reflexes is most likely to have a peripheral cause of hypotonia
involving anterior horn cells, nerve, neuromuscular junction,
or muscle (Box 1).

Posture: lack of/reduced spontaneous movements; full
abduction of legs; arms either extended at the sides of the
body or flexed at elbow with hands beside the head (Fig 1A)
Skeletal: fixed deformities like clubfoot, arthrogryposis,
pectus excavatum, hyperlaxity of skin and joints
Dysmorphic features
Evidence of hypotonia:
{{ Horizontal suspension: the infant is suspended in
prone position with the examiner’s palm underneath
the chest. The hands and legs of a hypotonic infant lies
limply forming an inverted “U” posture
{{ Vertical suspension: an infant who has hypotonia “slips
through” at the shoulders when the examiner grasps
him/her under the arms in an upright position
{{ Traction response: head lag or hyperextension is
evident when the infant is pulled by the arms from a
supine to sitting position (Fig 1B)
{{ Scarf sign: in a hypotonic infant, on grasping the
infant’s hand and pulling it across the chest, the elbow
can easily be brought well beyond the midline
{{ Wheel barrow: in prone position when the child is
raised holding his legs in the air, whether he/she can
support his weight on hands is tested
A complete neurological examination should be performed.
Of particular importance are the following:

CEREBRAL HYPOTONIA
Neonatal and infantile hypotonia is common in most cerebral
disorders. But in some of them, hypotonia is one of the most

a central versus peripheral cause (Box 2).

• Increased tone of neck extensor

• Normal or brisk tendon
reflexes
• Other organ involvement

SYNDROMIC HYPOTONIA
An infant with dysmorphism and hypotonia may require
chromosomal analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) studies to diagnose the appropriate syndrome.

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)
This is caused by deletion of paternally-contributed proximal
long arm of chromosome 15 or maternal disomy (both
chromosomes 15 received from mother). Hypotonia at birth
along with severe feeding problems requiring nasogastric tube
feeding is a significant neonatal history in patients of PWS.
Delayed milestone is the usual presenting feature. Hyperphagia
and obesity develops later in childhood.

Joubert Syndrome
Classic Joubert syndrome is characterized by distinct cerebellar
and brainstem malformations, hypotonia, and developmental
delays. Often there is presence of oculomotor apraxia and
episodic tachypnea. Cognitive disabilities are variable.

Chapter 89: Approach to Floppy Infant
Many other syndromes have central hypotonia. Among
them, Down syndrome is usually diagnosed early due to
presence of typical facies.

NONSYNDROMIC CENTRAL HYPOTONIA
There are patients who have anomalies or abnormalities of
central nervous system in absence of any particular syndrome.
The neurological examination may reveal global or motor delay
in presence of signs suggestive of central hypotonia. These
patients may have presence of minor anomalies of the brain
broadly classified as cerebral dysgenesis, some of them may have
delayed myelination or even normal neuroimaging findings.

Box 3: Evaluation of motor unit disorders
• Genetic test: survival motor
neuron and congenital
muscular dystrophy screening
• Enzyme analysis—alpha
glucosidase (acid maltase)
• Muscle biopsy
• Nerve biopsy

• Creatine phosphokinase,
aldolase
• Neostigmine test
• Electrodiagnosis: nerve
conduction study,
electromyography,
repetitive nerve
stimulation

Differential Diagnosis (Table 1)
Spinal Muscular Atrophy

Systemic Disease
In a newborn and sometimes in infants, systemic disease can
cause hypotonia. Presence of congenital heart disease and in
an acute setting, sepsis may be responsible for hypotonia.

Craniocervical Junction Lesions
Obstetric injuries to the cord result in neonatal hypotonia.
Later patients may have flexion of arms with flaccid paraplegia.
A distended bladder with overflow incontinence is highly
suggestive of cord injury in such cases.

BENIGN CONGENITAL HYPOTONIA
This is a nonprogressive neurological disorder characterized
by generalized flaccidity of muscles and hypermobile joints.
Deep-tendon reflexes are normal or mildly exaggerated.
An increased incidence of intellectual disability, learning
disability and likewise is evident later in life. A high family
incidence is reported. This is a diagnosis of exclusion, and all
routine investigations are normal.

Clinical Pearl
• Hypotonia without weakness may suggest a syndromic
diagnosis (Down’s, Prader-Willi).

MOTOR UNIT DISORDERS
There may be many clues in history and neurological
examination that suggest a peripheral cause of hypotonia.
A maternal account of reduced fetal movements and
polyhydroamnios; “myopathic” facies; tongue fasciculations
or polyminimyoclonus; low-pitched cry; and lack of antigravity
movements are all markers of a lower motor neuron cause of a
floppy infant (Box 3).

These are progressive group of disorders associated with
deletions or mutations in exons 7 and 8 of the telomeric copy
of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). The centromeric
copy (SMN2) is the disease-modifying gene with milder cases
having more copies.
In type 1, onset of weakness is before 6 months of age; most
patients do not achieve sitting. In type 2, onset is between 6–18
months; most patients can sit but never walk. In type 3, onset is
after 18 months and such patients may be difficult to diagnose
and confused with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.
In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), there is presence of
proximal more than distal weakness and despite of intrauterine
hypotonia, arthrogryposis is not present. Electro­myography
study reveals fibrillations and fasciculations.
Once the genetic testing confirms SMA, the same should
be performed in chorionic villi biopsy sample for prenatal
diagnosis.

Congenital Muscular Dystrophy
This group is classified into syndromic and, non­syndromic
forms. The nonsyndromic form may have merosin deficient
congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) or merosin positive
CMD.
Delayed motor milestones, hypotonia, contractures,
and high creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values help to
diagnose this condition. In merosin deficient CMD, MRI brain
shows abnormal T2 hyperintensity giving an impression of
leucodystrophy (Fig. 2).
Syndromic congenital muscular dystrophy is characterized
by anomalies of cortical migration, ocular abnormalities like
cataract, and muscle disease with high CPK.

Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy
Prominent clinical feature of this autosomal dominant
disorder include facial diplegia; significant neonatal feeding

difficulty; and mental retardation. The mother is usually the
affected parent when a child has the disease. There is unstable
trinucleotide expansion with 300–1000 CTG repeats and hence
genetic anticipation is common in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
Cardiac dysrhythmias and cataract may also be present.

Pompe’s Disease
Hypotonia in Pompe’s disease is the result of glycogen storage
in brain, spinal cord, and skeletal muscles. The presence of
cardiomegaly with abnormal electrocardiogram is highly
suggestive of alpha glucosidase deficiency.
After establishing the diagnosis with the help of enzyme
analysis, patient should be offered enzyme-replacement
therapy which is available at certain centers in India.

Myasthenic Syndromes
Transitory neonatal myasthenia usually presents as hypotonia
and feeding difficulty; the cry of such an infant is weak and there
is lack of facial expression. Antiacetylcholine receptor (AChR)
antibody is high and such newborns respond to neostigmine.
Familial infantile myasthenia with prominent respiratory
and feeding difficulty at birth and congenital myasthenia
with predominant ocular findings are genetic myasthenic
syndromes with negative anti AChR antibodies. These patients
may have episodic apneas which could be life threatening.

Hypotonia is a manifestation of many acute neonatal injuries.
The profile of disorders presenting with neonatal hypotonia
to the neonatal intensive care unit was studied in an 11-year
retrospective cohort of neonates admitted to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit at the Montreal Children’s Hospital
(Montreal, Québec). Of the 50 neonates, who met the inclusion
criteria, hypotonia was classified as central in 33 patients (66%)
and peripheral in 17 (34%). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
(n = 13), Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 6), myotonic dystrophy
(n = 6), other muscle disorders (n = 6), chromosomal disorders
(n = 4), and peripheral nerve disorders (n = 3) were the most
common diagnoses. The genetic tests of highest yield were
FISH and DNA methylation studies for PWS, trinucleotide
repeat testing for myotonic dystrophy, and karyotype analysis
(Richer et al. 2001).

Approach to Ataxia
Jayakumar Vaikundam

INTRODUCTION

SENSORY ATAXIA

Ataxia is a common symptom manifesting as unsteady gait,
frequent falls, and clumsiness in walking or in using the hands
due to derangement in posture control, movement, and coordination.
Ataxia can occur as a result of:
• Cerebellar dysfunction
• Posterior column dysfunction
• Vestibular dysfunction
Hence, as a first step one should be able to identify which
is the main structure that is affected to result in ataxia. Table 1
will help in the differentiation.

The most common cause of sensory ataxia in children
is vitamin B12 deficiency. It is more commonly seen in
vegetarians. Apart from the dietary insufficiency and
malabsorptive state, lack of intrinsic factor can also lead to
vitamin B12 deficiency state.
It is clinically characterized by anemia, lethargy, poor
cognitive performance, hypotonia, sensory ataxia, and
involuntary movements especially in infants. Neurological
examination will reveal hyporeflexia, posterior column
involvement, and bilateral extensor plantar response due to
additional pyramidal tract involvement.

SECTION 11: Neurology
One important clinical clue for vitamin B12 deficiency
state is the presence of hyperpigmentation over the dorsum of
interphalangeal joints, knuckles, palmar creases, intertriginous
areas, and recent scars. The mechanism for hyperpigmentation
is not known and it is reversible disappearing with treatment.
Peripheral smear studies will show macrocytic anemia,
hypersegmented polymorphs, bone marrow showing mega­
loblastic reaction. Serum vitamin B12 level is low. Magnetic
resonance imaging studies usually show the picture of subacute
combined degeneration causing increased signal intensity in
T2W images in the posterior columns of cervical and thoracic
spinal cord. Treatment may reverse these changes.

TABLE 2: Cerebellar ataxia: localizing features
Site of involvement
• Midline:

Upper vermis lesion
Lower vermis lesion
{{ Fastigial nuclear
lesion

• Hyperpigmentation over the knuckles, interphalangeal joints
in an ataxic child should suggest the possibility of vitamin B12
deficiency which is eminently treatable.

Cerebellar dysfunction appears to be the most common cause
for ataxia and is characterized by the following clinical features
which will help to some extent to identify which portion
of the cerebellum is the most affected, although there is a
considerable overlap.
• Ataxia:
{{ Vermis lesions produce truncal ataxia and titubation
{{ Hemispherical lesions produce limb ataxia with a
tendency to lurch to the side of lesion
{{ Anterior lobe lesions produce gait ataxia
• Kinetic tremor and incoordination: seen in hemispherical
lesions involving dentate nucleus
• Hypotonia: seen mostly in acute lesions than in chronic
• Nystagmus and eye movement abnormalities: seen
commonly in flocculonodular lobe and vermis lesions
• Dysarthria: slurring, scanning, and staccato speech are
commonly in left cerebellar hemispherical lesions.

Clinical Pearl

Recurrent attacks of vertigo with unsteadiness, nystagmus,
and vomiting sometimes can occur in infants and preschool
children as a part of benign paroxysmal vertigo. The episode
lasts for few minutes and may recur irregularly.
It is often considered as a variant of migraine and nearly
one-fourth of them subsequently develop migraine. There is
often a family history of migraine.

Clinical features

Clinical Pearls
•
•
•
•

Nystagmus is a sign of flocculonodular lobe lesion
Truncal ataxia is a sign of vermis lesion
Limb incoordination is a sign of cerebellar hemispherical lesion
Gait ataxia is a sign of involvement of anterior lobe of
cerebellum.

Clinical Approach to Cerebellar Ataxia
Cerebellar ataxia can be acute, intermittent/episodic or
chronic. Algorithm 1 describes the different causes.

Acute Cerebellar Ataxias
Acute cerebellar ataxias due to
infective/parainfective causes
•

Often occur following infections with varicella, mumps,
and other viral infections
ALGORITHM 1
Approach to an ataxic child (acute/episodic intermittent
cerebellar ataxia)

Clinical Pearls
• Nystagmus, dysarthria, incoordination suggest cerebellar ataxia
• Hypotonia is usually seen in acute lesions than in chronic.

Table 2 describes the localizing features of different signs.

SOL, space occupying lesion; GBS, Guillain-Barré syndrome; ADEM, acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis, MS, multiple sclerosis.

CHAPTER 90: Approach to Ataxia
•

•

Occur either immediately following fever or within 6
weeks, characterized by headache, vomiting, a severe gait
disturbance, nystagmus, and behavioral changes with
increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count in viral
cerebellitis and normal cell count in postinfectious ataxia
along with mild increase in proteins
Although there is no specific therapy, most of them respond
well to antiviral (acyclovir) drugs, steroids, and intravenous
immunoglobulin therapy.

Ataxia due to drugs
•

•
•
•

Overdose of phenytoin, phenobarbitone, carbamazepine,
phenothiazines, benzodiazepines, and sometimes
anthelmintic drugs like piperazine; antihistamine are wellknown to produce acute ataxias
Some helpful clues are drowsiness, vomiting, or nystagmus
which is less prominent on downward gaze and absence
of fever
Electroencephalogram in some of these patients may show
diffuse fast activity, indicative of sedative drug overdose
The treatment depends on the identification of the specific
causative drug. In certain life-threatening situations,
dialysis and vital support function may be required.

Kinsbourne syndrome
(opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome)
It is characterized by:
• Acute or subacute onset of peculiar dancing eye movements
in different directions and planes (opsoclonus) due to
unwanted spontaneous saccades. Opsoclonus may persist
during sleep
• Myoclonic jerking of the trunk and limbs which may be
stimulus sensitive and may increase with action
• Child is often irritable and ataxic and may require support
with hands and may be even afraid of standing or sitting
without support
• Nearly about 50% of the children with opsoclonusmyoclonus may have occult neuroblastoma and these
symptoms can precede the diagnosis of the tumor
• May need abdominal ultrasonogram; urinary vanillyl­
mandelic acid and homovanillic acid estimation; and
in some cases computed tomography chest, abdomen;
metaiodobenzylguanidine; or Dotatoc scan may be
required
• Injection adrenocorticotropic hormone is useful in some
patients.

Guillain-Barre syndrome/Miller Fisher syndrome
•
•
•
•

Early stages of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) can
present with ataxia and subsequently patient may develop
weakness
A variant of GBS—viz. Miller Fisher syndrome characterized
by acute ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia can present
with acute ataxia
Ophthalmoplegia in Miller Fisher syndrome starts initially
with upward gaze restriction followed by lateral gaze and
finally down gaze restriction
Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is useful.

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
•

•
•
•

•

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is usually a
monophasic illness following a viral infection, immuni­
zation or vaccination usually after an afebrile period
following the initial febrile illness
Usually characterized by altered mental status, irritability
and lethargy, seizures, and focal neurological deficits
Some children may present with brainstem signs, limb
ataxia, nystagmus, and bilateral optic neuritis (in multiple
sclerosis the optic neuritis is unilateral)
In MRI, T2W/FLAIR images will show multiple subcortical
lesions (usually at the junction of deep cortical gray
and subcortical white matter) with smudging of edges
(in contrast the multiple sclerosis lesions will have sharp
clear margins)
Treatment involves mainly intravenous methyl predni­
solone and in some cases intravenous immuno­globulin.

Childhood multiple sclerosis
•
•
•
•
•
•

Around 4–5% of them can occur in children (mostly around
10–15 years of age)
Visual disturbances are common apart from brainstem,
cerebellar, and long tract disturbances
In contrast to adult type of multiple sclerosis, seizures and
mental status changes are common in children
Magnetic resonance imaging typically shows hyper­intense
T2W lesions in cerebellum, brainstem, periventricular, and
pericallosal white matter
Evoked potentials studies and CSF immunoglobulin G
index and CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands are useful
Treatment involves intravenous methyl prednisolone.

Psychogenic
The following clues help in the diagnosis of acute psychogenic
ataxia:
• Ataxia occurs immediately on standing
• Bizarre and gross
• Absence of wide based stance
• Tendency to move from one object to another in a room to
get a support
• Absence of other neurological signs.

Other causes
•
•
•
•

Space-occupying-lesions—cerebellar abscess
Traumatic
Vascular—cerebellar hemorrhage, infarct, or arterial
dissection
Basilar migraine.

Clinical Pearls
• Drug-induced ataxia should always be considered first in acute
ataxia
• Past history of chicken pox should always be asked
• Guillain-Barré syndrome should be considered when there is
ataxia with absent deep tendon reflexes
• In a febrile ataxic child with history of chronic suppurative otitis
media, always rule out cerebellar abscess
• Past history of similar episode could suggest the possibility of
episodic ataxias.

Episodic/Recurrent/Intermittent Ataxias

ALGORITHM 2

Recurrent attacks of ataxia can occur either as a form of
hereditary episodic ataxia or due to some metabolic disorders.

Hereditary episodic ataxia
Although there are four types of hereditary ataxias Type I and
Type II are more common and their differentiating features are
outlined in the table 3.

Metabolic disorders producing intermittent ataxia
The usual clues are—lethargy, vomiting and occasional ICT. The
following metabolic disorders can present with intermittent
ataxia.
• Hartnup disease
• Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency
• Biotidinase deficiency
• Maple syrup urine disease
• Certain urea cycle—ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency

Other causes of intermittent ataxia
Children with Down syndrome can present with ataxia,
transient weakness of the limbs, especially after sudden flexion
of the neck usually after vigorous towelling of the head after
head bath due to recurrent atlanto-axial subluxation.

Clinical Pearls
• Pellagra like pigmentation suggest the possibility of Hartnup
Disease
• Increased blood pyruvate and lactate suggest pyruvate
dehydrogenase deficiency
• Alopecia, dermatitis, and deafness suggest biotinidase deficiency
• Acetazolamide is useful for Type I and Type II hereditary episodic
ataxias
• Always rule-out atlanto-axial subluxation in an ataxic Down
syndrome child.

Chronic Ataxias

430

Chronic ataxia can be nonprogressive or progressive and the
various causes are outlined in the algorithm 2.

Chronic nonprogressive cerebellar ataxias
There are two major conditions which can cause nonprogressive
cerebellar ataxias, viz.
1. Congenital malformations of the brain
2. Ataxic form of cerebral palsy.

Congenital malformations of the brain
The following malformations often cause nonprogressive
cerebellar ataxia:
• Cerebellar hypoplasia
• Vermian hypoplasia:
{{ Joubert’s syndrome
{{ Dandy-Walker syndrome

CHAPTER 90: Approach to Ataxia
Chiari malformation
Rhombencephalosynapsis
Congenital cerebellar hypoplasia:
{{ Autosomal recessive disorder
{{ Characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, nystagmus
{{ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain will show
mainly cerebellar hemispherical atrophy
{{ It should be differentiated from other progressive
conditions by serial MRI and involvement of brainstem
and other neurological findings.
Cerebellar vermian hypoplasia: The vermis of the cerebellum
is maximally involved in the following conditions:
{{ Joubert’s syndrome:
–– Autosomal recessive disorder with partial or total
agenesis or hypoplasia of the vermis
–– Characteristic facies, squint, ataxia, oculomotor
apraxia, and breathing ab­normalities are typical
–– MRI brain will show the following characteristic
findings:
■■ Molar tooth appearance of the brainstem
■■ Bullet-shaped upper-fourth ventricle
■■ Horizontal superior cerebellar peduncle
■■ Bat-wing appearance of the lower fourth ventricle.
{{ Dandy-Walker malformation:
–– Clinically patients present with hydrocephalus and
large posterior fossa
–– Vermian hypoplasia (mainly caudal vermis)
and cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle are
characteristic imaging findings
{{ Chiari malformation:
–– Clinically patients present with vague pain in the
neck, suboccipital headache, and ataxia
–– The characteristic clinical clues are presence of
down beat nystagmus, oscillopsia
–– May be associated with syrinx, lower cranial nerves
palsy and skeletal abnormalities
–– Magnetic resonance imaging of craniovertebral
junction will show downward displacement of the
cerebellar tonsil which is peg shaped. Coexistent
syrinx may be seen
–– Treatment involves surgical decompression.

•

•

Ataxic form of cerebral palsy
•
•
•
•
•

Accounts for 5–10% of all forms of cerebral palsy
50% of them are autosomal recessively inherited
History of birth asphyxia, mild spasticity, brisk reflexes,
and ataxia
Lack of correlation between imaging and clinical findings
Recent gene mapping to chromosome 9p12-q12 is useful
to differentiate this from other conditions.

Clinical Pearls
• Most of the congenital cerebellar malformations cause nonprogressive ataxias
• Brisk deep tendon reflexes in a child with nonprogressive
ataxia suggest the possibility of ataxic form of cerebral palsy
• Imaging findings do not correlate with clinical picture in ataxic
cerebral palsy.

Chronic Progressive Cerebellar Ataxias
Chronic progressive cerebellar ataxias could be due to:
• Hereditary ataxias which could be autosomal dominant or
autosomal recessively inherited
• Metabolic disorders
• Cerebellar tumors
• Chronic hydrocephalus.
• Hereditary ataxias:
{{ Autosomal dominant variety is mostly seen in adults
{{ Autosomal recessive disorders include:
–– Friedreich’s ataxia
–– Ataxia telangiectasia
–– Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia
–– Abetalipoproteinemia
–– Vitamin E deficiency
–– Congenital disorder of glycosylation
–– Refsum disease
–– Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome.
{{ Autosomal Recessive hereditary ataxias:
–– Friedreich’s ataxia:
■■ Autosomal recessive disorder due to defective
expression of “frataxin” encoded by X25 gene at
chromosome 9
■■ Onset around puberty
■■ Pes cavus, loss of deep tendon reflexes; extensor
plantar and posterior column sensory loss, apart
from cerebellar signs are the cardinal features
■■ In 25% of them deep-tendon reflexes may be
normal
■■ Magnetic resonance imaging brain will show
atrophy of cerebellum, cervical cord and
abnormal signals in the posterior and lateral
columns
■■ Nerve conduction and somatosensory evoked
potentials studies may show abnormality
■■ Cardiomyopathy is seen in 50% and diabetes in
10%
■■ Idebenone has been found to be useful for
cardiac dysfunction
■■ Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing
showing GAA trinucleotide repeats in the range
of 600–900 repeats

Clinical Pearl
• Deep tendon reflexes can be normal in 25% of patients with
Friedreich’s ataxia.

–– Ataxia telangiectasia:
■■ Autosomal recessive disorder affecting nervous
and immune system due to deficiency of ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein
■■ Mutation in the large ATM gene linked to
chromosome 11q22-23
■■ Choreoathetosis followed by ataxia and
dysarthria occur early
■■ Oculomotor apraxia is seen in 90% of patients.

Clinical Pearls
• Conjunctival telangiectasia develops later usually after 2 years
of age
• Telangiectasia tends to grow with age
• Telangiectasia becomes more prominent after exposure to
sunlight for some time
• Oculomotor apraxia is seen in Joubert’s syndrome, ataxia
telangiectasia, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia without
telangiectasia, and in Gaucher’s disease
• Serum albumin testing is important.

Metabolic Disorders causing progressive ataxias:
{{ Abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig Disease):
–– Autosomal recessive disorder
–– Due to absence of microsomal triglycerides
transfer protein, linked to chromosome 4q22-q24
causing absence of apolipoprotein B which results
in deficiency of vitamins A, D, E, and K
–– Failure to thrive, steatorrhea, vomiting, ataxia,
areflexia, and proprioceptive disturbance are the
common clinical features
–– Retinitis pigmentosa is a constant feature usually
seen before 10 years of age
–– Peripheral smear will reveal acanthocytosis
–– Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are low (due
to low apolipoprotein B)
–– Nerve conduction studies may show abnormalities
–– Treatment includes restriction of fat, and large
doses of vitamin E (100 mg/kg/day).
{{ Vitamin E deficiency:
–– Autosomal recessive disorder linked to chromosome
8q13
–– No malabsorption only isolated deficiency of
vitamin E
–– Ataxia and peripheral neuropathy
–– Resembles Friedreich’s ataxia
–– Diagnosed by low vitamin E level and normal
vitamin E absorption
–– Treatment includes 800–900 IU of vitamin E.

Clinical Pearl
• Isolated vitamin E deficiency can resemble Friedreich’s ataxia.
Hence, when in doubt, it is always better to give a therapeutic
trial with vitamin E
{{

Refsum disease:
–– Autosomal recessive disorder due to deficiency of
phytanic acid oxidase

Acute Hemiplegia in Children:
An Algorithm for Diagnosis and Treatment
Viraj V Sanghi

INTRODUCTION

Clinical Pearl

Hemiplegia is defined as complete paralysis of one-half of the
body with or without facial involvement. The term hemiparesis
refers to partial weakness of one-half of the body. The etiology
of hemiplegia is vast and varied. The age of onset plays a vital
role in determining the etiology.

HEMIPLEGIA IN INFANTS
Infantile hemiplegia is most commonly seen as a result
of perinatal hypoxic or vascular events, infantile acquired
cerebral infections, and the hemiconvulsion-hemiplegiaepilepsy syndrome.

Perinatal Stroke
The rate of arterial infarction in neonates is as high as the
annual incidence of large-vessel ischemic stroke in adults.
The incidence of perinatal stroke has been estimated at 1 in
1,600–5,000 births. Neonatal cerebral infarction accounts
for 10–15% of the total number of neonates with seizures
and is the main identified cause of congenital hemiplegia.
Most perinatal strokes involve the middle cerebral artery
and are caused by thromboembolism from an intracranial
or extracranial vessel, the heart, or the placenta. Various risk
factors have been associated with perinatal stroke. Maternal
risk factors associated with fetal stroke include prothrombotic
disorders, cocaine abuse, and placental complications such as
chorioamnionitis and placental vasculopathy. During delivery,
cervical arterial dissection may occur which leads to stroke.
In the neonatal period, prothrombotic disorders, congenital
heart disease, meningitis, and systemic infection can all lead to
perinatal stroke (Box 1).

Ch-91.indd 435

• Focal clonic seizure in the newborn period is the most common
clinical presentation of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke.

The majority of newborns do not go onto develop epilepsy.
About 40% of patients do not have specific symptoms in the
neonatal period and may be asymptomatic until months later
when the infant is first noted to have pathological handedness.
Hemiparesis is then noticed on clinical examination in later
stages of infancy. Neuroimaging in these infants then leads to
a retrospective diagnosis of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke
(AIS). The recurrence rate after perinatal stroke is very low
(Fig. 1) .

Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy Syndrome
Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome is an un­
common outcome of prolonged focal status epilepticus in
childhood. The prolonged focal motor seizure usually occurs
during the course of a febrile illness and is followed by
hemiplegia, ipsilateral to the side of convulsions. A prolonged
febrile seizure results in inflammation which may worsen the
level of cell injury. Inflammation and prolonged ictal activity
act on blood-brain-barrier permeability. There may also be
predisposing factors facilitating prolonged seizure such as
genetic factors or focal epileptogenic lesion (Fig. 2).

HEMIPLEGIA IN OLDER CHILDREN
In older children, the etiology differs from that of infantile
hemiplegia. The causes of acute hemiplegia are varied (Box 2).
Extensive clinical, radiological, and laboratory workup is
essential to arrive at a diagnosis before commencing treatment.

during the past two decades. The recent reported incidence
rates are between three and eight per 100,000 children per
year. The major syndromes comprising ischemic stroke in
childhood consist of AIS and sinovenous thrombosis (SVT).
Arterial ischemic strokes constitute 80% of cases.
Toddlers with AIS more frequently present with abrupt
onset of a hemiparesis, with facial droop, difficulty using
one hand, or dragging of one leg. In school age or teenage
child, other symptoms such as speech or visual disturbance;
headache, or focal sensory deficits may be seen in addition to
hemiparesis. Seizures accompany the stroke in approximately
50% of children (Box 3) .
In SVT, a clinical picture indistinguishable from
“pseudotumor cerebri” is the most frequent presentation,
characterized by prominent headache, papilledema and
occasionally sixth nerve palsy. Visual disturbances including

A wide range of risk factors/causes associated with
childhood AIS (Box 3). These include cardiac disorders,
sickle-cell disease, prothrombotic disorders, trauma, and
major infections such as meningitis, sepsis, and encephalitis.
However, in the majority of the children, no underlying
systemic disease is found. With advances in neuroimaging,
cerebral arteriopathies are increasingly recognized as one of
the major causes of childhood stroke, in otherwise healthy
children. Some arteriopathies are due to well-recognized
causes such as arterial dissection, moyamoya syndrome or
disease, connective tissue disorders, and sickle-cell disease.
Late effects of radiation to the head and neck in childhood
cancer survivors have also been associated with stroke due to
cerebrovascular disease, and children with neurofibromatosis
can have complications of a cerebral arteriopathy. However, in
up to 30% of children presenting with a first AIS, a focal arterial
stenosis is identified but none of the classic underlying causes
are discovered.
Transient Cerebral Arteriopathy (TCA), the most common
type of arteriopathy identified in pediatric stroke, is a monophasic
arterial disease characterized by a unilateral focal or segmental
stenosis involving the distal part of the internal carotid and the
initial segments and branches of the anterior and/or middle
cerebral artery followed by complete or partial resolution. The
pathophysiology of TCA is uncertain. 44% of TCA cases are
associated with varicella zoster infection in the 12 months prior
to AIS causing postvaricella arteriopathy. Varicella virus invades
the arterial wall causing an acute vasculitis. Other frequent
infectious agents such as parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, enterovirus,
human immunodeficiency virus and Helicobacter pylori might
be responsible for TCA (Algorithm 1).

Treatment
Acute treatment of children with stroke includes:
• Maintenance of respiratory and cardiovascular status
• Aggressive treatment of infection, seizures, and fever
• Maintenance of normoglycemia and normovolemia
• Adequate blood pressure should be maintained
• Intracranial hypertension may require mannitol and
hyperventilation to prevent cerebral herniation.
Anticoagulation with heparin can be considered in some
children with AIS, particularly those with arterial dissection
or progressive neurologic deficits believed to be a result of
recurrent emboli or thrombosis. Anticoagulation in cardiac
embolism is controversial. Aspirin is the most commonly used
antiplatelet agent. The recommended dosage is 3–5 mg/kg/
day. Treatment of children with AIS using tissue plasminogen
activator (t-PA) is limited due to delayed diagnosis and lack of
safety and efficacy studies and is not currently recommended
as standard treatment protocol. Moyamoya disease can be
treated surgically with revascularization.

Demyelination in Children
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immunemediated inflammatory and demyelinating disorder of the
central nervous system, commonly preceded by an infection.
It principally involves the white matter tracts of the cerebral
hemispheres, brainstem, optic nerves, and spinal cord. Acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis mainly affects children.
Clinically, patients present with multifocal neurologic
abnormalities that reflects the widespread involvement in
central nervous system. Cerebrospinal fluid may be normal
or may show a mild pleocytosis with or without elevated
protein levels. Magnetic resonance image shows multiple
demyelinating lesions. The diagnosis of ADEM requires both
multifocal involvement and encephalopathy by consensus
criteria. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis typically has a
monophasic course with a favorable prognosis.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory
demyelinating syndrome of the central nervous system.

Management of acute hemiplegia in children

ICU, intensive care unit; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; CT, computed tomography; TIA, transient ischemic attack; AHC,
alternating hemiplegia of childhood; ICP, intracranial pressure; TCA, transient cerebral arteriopathy.

Consensus criteria have been proposed by the International
Paediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group. Acute attacks are
managed with intravenous methylprednisolone (10–30 mg/
kg/dose) for 3–5 days. This may be followed by a tapering
course of oral prednisone (starting dose of 1–2 mg/kg/
day). Immunomodulatory therapies are introduced early
in the course of disease with the aim of reducing disability
and cerebral atrophy. First line agents include interferon-β
and glatiramer acetate. Disease modifying therapy should
be offered to any patient with MS after a second attack of
demyelination.

Approach to a Child
with Spastic Paraplegia
Arun G Roy, Vinayan KP

INTRODUCTION
Paraplegia is defined as partial or complete weakness of both
legs sparing the upper limbs. This can be due to upper motor
neuron (UMN) or lower motor neuron (LMN) pathology.
The UMN lesion should be above L1 segment involving
the pyramidal tract (thoracic or cervical) of spinal cord or
rarely in cerebral cortex involving the leg area (parasagittal)
or subcortical regions affecting the fibers to legs to cause
spastic paraplegia. Lower motor neuron lesion of paraplegia
is secondary to intramedullary lesion affecting the lumbar
and sacral spinal segments of legs (L1–5 and S1–3), multiple
root involvement (L1–5 and S1–3), multiple peripheral nerve
involvement, and rarely anterior horn cell disease. In this
chapter we are describing paraplegia secondary to spinal
lesions. The most common cause of cerebral paraplegia in
children is cerebral palsy, which is not discussed in this chapter.

Clinical Pearl
• The first step of diagnosis is to localize whether it is primarily
upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesion as it helps
to narrow down the localization and avoid over investigating
the patient. Hence, a detailed history and examination is vital.

Clinical features of upper motor
and lower motor neuron lesions
A child refusing to stand or walk or bear weight is the most
common complaint in acute causes, while dragging of legs,
tripping of toes while walking may favor spasticity of legs in
chronic disorders. Parents may describe the limb as flaccid
or stiff on handling. In an acute UMN lesion, muscle tone is
flaccid with hyporeflexia before the appearance of spasticity.
The pyramidal distribution of weakness has specific pattern
in limbs which is seen when weakness is not severe. In lower
limbs, weakness is most marked in flexors and internal rotators
of hip, knee flexors, and toe and ankle dorsiflexors. The

Ch-92.indd 440

spasticity is most marked in extensors of lower limbs which is
best elicited on flexion movements of leg. Deep tendon reflexes
(DTR) are exaggerated with extensor plantars in UMN lesion.

Clinical Pearl
• By rule, upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions cause spastic
paraplegia and lower motor neuron lesions result in flaccid
paraplegia with exemption of acute spinal shock where lesion
is UMN but paraplegia is flaccid

In LMN lesion, the weakness is in distribution of spinal
segment, root, nerve, anterior horn cell, or muscle depending
on site of involvement with hypotonia in weak muscles. Wasting
of muscles is another feature noted. The DTRs are hyporeflexic
with flexor plantars (Table 1).
Primary sensations, pain, and temperature are carried
by lateral spinothalamic tract while vibration, joint-position
sensations, and fine touch are by posterior column and
crude touch by anterior spinothalamic tract. An older child
can complain of burning pain, tingling, numbness of legs, or
loss of sensations which can indicate a sensory involvement.
The distribution of sensory level depends on site of lesion. In
spinal cord, there can be differential involvement of tracts and
sensation will be lost below the level of lesion. Since posterior
column crosses at level of medulla, spinal cord lesion causes

Types of spinal cord disorders
Spinal cord disorders can be extramedullary or intra­medullary
(Fig. 2 and 3). The clinical features can vary in extramedullary
and intramedullary spinal disease (Table 3). This is because of
the lamination of tracts in the cord and type of compression
of these tracts. Extramedullary means the lesion is outside
the cord and can be intradural or extradural. Intradural
lesions involve predominantly dura and root (examples:
neurofibroma, meningioma), while extradural lesions are in
vertebrae and surrounding structures (example: Pott’s spine).
Radicular pain, giibbus, vertebral pain, and spine tenderness
are features of extramedullary disorders.

loss of sensation ipsilaterally, while spinothalamic tract
crossing occurs at spinal level, hence, the loss of sensation
will be contra­lateral to site of lesion while transection of cord
will cause sensation loss of all tracts bilaterally (Fig 1). In
cortex and subcortical region, sensory loss is contralateral to
site of lesion (Table 2).
Normal bladder and bowel control depends on segmental
reflexes involving both autonomic and somatic motor neurons,
as well as descending and ascending tracts of the spinal cord.
Hence, bladder and bowel function may be impaired after
an injury to any segmental level of the spinal cord. Bladder
involvement can be retention of urine or incontinence of urine
(urge or over flow). Urge incontinence is seen in UMN bladder,
where lesion is above S2–S4 segments, while retention and
overflow incontinence favors LMN bladder (S2–S4 segments or
roots). A palpable bladder indicates retention of urine. Injuries
to the spinal cord that result in paraplegia from a lesion above
T6 may also impair autonomic control and result in episodes
of severe hypertension or hypotension. This is due to excessive
and uncontrolled sympathetic output from the spinal cord.
Common triggers include bladder distension, constipation,
rectal fissures, joint injury and urinary tract infection.

Clinical Pearls
• Cortical lesions: spastic paraparesis is usually accompanied by
upper motor neuron (UMN) cranial nerve palsies, UMN bladder
• Brainstem lesions: spastic paraparesis is accompanied by
cranial nerve palsies—UMN or lower motor neuron depending
on the site of lesion (mid brain, pons, medulla), UMN bladder
± sensory tracts
• Spinal cord lesions: spastic paraparesis with sensory tract
involvement, sensory level and UMN bladder, there is no
cranial nerve involvement.

At the site of lesion, there can be LMN weakness, band

involvement.

CAUSES OF SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA
Depending on presentation and duration it can be acute or
chronic. Etiology varies depending on presentation, hence
onset is important. Family history should be asked regarding
similar illness, which helps in diagnosing inherited causes of
spastic paraplegia like hereditary spastic paraplegia and leuko­
dystrophy. Etiology can be broadly classified into compressive
and noncompressive myelopathy (Table 5 and 6). In compressive
myelopathy, there is definite sensory level, radicular symptoms
at site of compression with asymmetric involvement of tracts
while in non compressive myelopathies, radicular symptoms
and definite sensory level are not seen and there is selective
sparing of tracts and findings are usually symmetric.

Pott's Spine
One of the leading causes of compressive myelopathy in
children. This can have an acute or a chronic presentation and
is due to cord compression secondary to vertebral destruction
and wedging. Local spine tenderness and Gibbus are features
of Pott’s spine. Gentle tapping over vertebra with finger is best
and safe way to elicit tenderness. Direct spinal cord involvement
due to tuberculosis infection is seen but less compared to Pott’s
spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the investigation
of choice as it shows involvement of disk, vertebra, and
the extension of disease into soft tissues. Treatment is with

Chapter 92: Approach to a Child with Spastic Paraplegia
antitubercular drugs and surgical intervention is indicated in
acute and severe paraparesis secondary to compression and
unstable spine.

Acute Transverse Myelitis
Transverse myelitis is a segmental spinal cord injury caused
by acute inflammation. The inflammation of TM is generally
restricted to one or two segments, usually in the thoracic
cord. The deficits are usually bilateral, producing weakness
and multimodality sensory disturbance below the level of the
lesion. Majority of cases are idiopathic but other causes are
infections, autoimmune disorders, demyelinating disorders
like multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica.
Cerebrospinal fluid can be normal or may show a moderate
lymphocytosis (typically <100/mm3) and an elevated
protein level (usually 100–120 mg/dL). Glucose levels are
normal. Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of
choice and can show local enlargement of the spinal cord
and increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images which
can extend few segments of cord. In MS, the extent is two or
less than two segments. Contrast enhancement may or may
not be there.

Intramedullary Spinal
Arteriovenous Malformations
Twenty percent of the lesions are diagnosed in children under
16 years of age. Myelopathy is produced by the mass effect of
the lesion or by ischemia or hemorrhage into the cord.

Adrenomyeloneuropathy
A variant of adrenoleukodystrophy, an X-linked recessive
disorder, is characterized by a slowly progressive spastic
paraparesis and mild polyneuropathy. Sensory and sphincter
disturbances are typically absent. There may be mild adrenal
insufficiency.

Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia
Inherited disorders, in which the prominent feature is a
progressive spastic paraparesis. Hereditary spastic paraplegia
is classified according to the mode of inheritance, and the
spastic paraplegia syndrome occurs alone or is accompanied
by additional neurologic or systemic abnormalities (“pure”
versus “complicated”). Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a
clinical diagnosis, based in large part on the family history.
Magnetic resonance imaging spine may be normal or show
cord atrophy.

Spinal Cord Tumors
This is a rare diagnosis in the pediatric population. The
types of tumors seen in children tend to be different than
the adult types. Intramedullary tumors are most common
type in children. In children with intramedullary tumors,
astrocytomas represent around 60% of tumors, ependymomas
30%, developmental tumors 4%, and then a group of other
less frequently identified types.

Ch-92.indd 443

Deficiency of Vitamin B12
Deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to degeneration of the dorsal
and lateral white matter of the spinal cord, producing a slowly
progressive weakness, sensory ataxia, and paresthesias, and
ultimately spasticity, paraplegia, and incontinence.

Tethered Cord Syndrome
Classically tethered cord syndrome has been defined as a
spectrum of congenital anomalies resulting in an abnormally
low position of the conus medullaris. Motor deficits are due
to UMN and LMN features, since there is involvement of
pyramidal tracts and lumbosacral roots. Children can present
with delayed gait development, spasticity, hyperreflexia,
hyporeflexia, and muscular atrophy. Sensory deficits, when
present, are due to tract or root involvement and children
can present with painless ulcers in leg. Neurogenic bladder
dysfunction can be incontinence, urgency, or with recurrent
urinary tract infections. Magnetic resonance imaging is
the modality of choice in visualizing the level of the conus
medullaris and for identifying terminal filum.

Key points

))
Paraplegia is weakness of lower limb sparing upper limbs; it
can be flaccid or spastic

Acute Febrile Encephalopathy
Rashmi Kumar

INTRODUCTIOn
The term acute febrile encephalopathy (AFE) literally
means acute onset of fever with encephalopathy (or altered
consciousness). This presentation is a very important cause
of hospital admissions in children in India. In 2006, World
Health Organization coined the term acute encephalitis
syndrome (AES) to include “a person of any age at any
time of year with the acute onset of fever and a change in
mental status (including symptoms such as confusion,
disorientation, coma, or inability to talk) and/or new onset of
seizures (excluding simple febrile seizures)”. Basically these
two terms mean the same thing and for the sake of uniformity
the term “acute encephalitis syndrome” is used.

Causes
Causes of AFE/AES are varied. Most commonly this presen­
tation is caused by actual invasion of the brain by an infectious
agent. The important causes of AFE are given in box 1.
Examination should be focused and should be looked for
(Box 2).
Although the etiology is varied, common causes may
predominate depending on the region. For example, Japanese
encephalitis (JE) is very common in large parts of east and
south India. Cerebral malaria is important in areas endemic for
Plasmodium falciparum. Dengue encephalopathy, rickettsiae,
leptospirosis, etc. are also reported from different parts of
India. The age, seasonal and rural-urban distribution, and
other epidemiologic clues may be helpful in suspecting specific
infections. Box 3 gives some epidemiological and clinical clues
to etiology.
In practice, the diagnosis of encephalitis is presumptive,
based on clinical assessment and exclusion of other
possibilities. Specific virological investigations are complex,
time consuming, and expensive. Even in advanced centers,
etiological diagnosis is possible in only a small proportion of
clinically suspected cases (Algorithm 1).

Ch-93.indd 444

Workup
A pragmatic investigative workup can be planned according to
common etiology of the region (Box 4).

Clinical Pearl
• Acute febrile encephalopathy/acute encephalopathy syndrome
can be divided into illnesses which are purely neuro­logical as in
japanese encephalitis, herpes simplex virus and rabies; or into
neurological plus systemic type as in dengue, malaria, enteric
and other non-viral agents like leptospirosis and rickettsioses.

Encephalopathies versus Meningoencephalitis
The term encephalopathy, besides meaning altered sensorium
also refers to a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to
a noninflammatory cause. Metabolic or toxic encephalopathy
can produce a picture of AFE. Examples of such metabolic/
toxic causes include Reye’s syndrome, dyselectrolytemia,
diabetic, uremic or hepatic coma, poisoning, and heat stroke.
Clues must be sought to differentiate encephalopathy from
encephalitis, but the distinction is not always possible on
clinical grounds. General features of encephalopathies are
shown in box 5.

TREATMENT (BOX 6)
Supportive treatment is the mainstay of therapy. A severe case
should be managed in an intensive care unit. Measures include
maintenance of airways, breathing, and circulation; hydration;
electrolyte status; and control of pyrexia and convulsions. It is
prudent to use appropriate parenteral antibiotics to cover for
meningitis. Raised intracranial tension should be controlled
with mannitol infusion (0.25–1.0 g/kg every 4–6 hours),
hypertonic saline infusion, intravenous furosemide or inter­
mittent positive pressure ventilation to keep arterial CO2
tension between 25–30 mmHg. Proper nursing care must

Box 5: Features of encephalopathies (diffuse cerebral
disturbance without inflammation)

Workup
• Blood counts including platelets and packed cell volume
• Rapid malaria test and smear for malarial parasite/dengue
• Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination: this is an essential
investigation but should be done only when considered safe.
CSF should be examined for total and differential cell count,
protein and sugar, bacterial culture and Gram stain; viral PCRs
and serology
• Virology: samples for viral culture from respiratory secretions,
throat swab, CSF, blood, urine, and stool taken as early as possible
in the illness should be collected in appropriate transport media
and sent to the reference laboratory
• Serological investigations in acute serum for specific
immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody level. JE is commonly
diagnosed by the antibody capture ELISA for IgM antibody in
acute phase serum and CSF
• Polymerase chain reaction is being developed to provide a rapid,
and accurate diagnostic tool for a host of pathogens and is the
mainstay of diagnosis. This is widely used for diagnosis of HSE
with high sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (100%)
• Neuroimaging should be done whenever possible. As far as
possible, magnetic resonance imaging should be insisted on.
It can show nonspecific features of encephalitis or specific
features suggestive of JE, Herpes simplex encephalitis or acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis. Imaging may also occasionally
reveal structural cause of coma (Figs 1 and 2)
• Blood chemistry: a routine blood chemistry may reveal a
metabolic cause of encephalopathy. Blood glucose, urea,
creatinine, electrolytes and liver function tests should be done.
• Blood culture: should be done in every case
• Other investigations may be done according to clinical clues

Features of encephalopathies
• Absence of fever or meningeal signs
• Absence of focal neurologic signs or focal seizures
• No peripheral leukocytosis
• Normal cerebrospinal fluid
• Diffuse slowing on electroencephalography
• Normal imaging studies

Box 6: Treatment of AFE/AES
Initial rapid assessment and stabilization
• Establish and maintain airway: Intubate if GCS ≤8, impaired airway
reflexes, abnormal respiratory pattern, signs of raised ICP, oxygen
saturation <92% despite high flow oxygen, fluid refractory shock
• Ventilation, oxygenation
• Circulation:
{{ Establish IV access, take samples (CBC, Blood sugar, KFT, LFT,
electrolytes, blood gas, lactate, PS and RDT for malarial parasite,
serology for viruses),
{{ Fluid bolus if in circulatory failure (20 mL/kg NS), inotropes if
required
• Identify signs of cerebral herniation or raised intracranial pressure
• Temperature: treat fever and hypothermia
• Treat ongoing Seizures: Benzodiazepine, followed by phenytoin
loading
Empirical treatment must be started if CSF examination cannot be
done or report will take time and patient is sick:
• Ceftriaxone
• Acyclovir (treat in all suspected sporadic viral encephalitis)
• Artesunate (stop if peripheral smear and rapid malaria test are
negative)

8 hours for 14 days (21 days in immunocompromised) is
indicated in herpes simplex encephalitis. Success of antiviral
therapy depends on early institution of therapy. Acyclovir is also
recommended for varicella-zoster encephalitis. Oseltamivir
can be considered for influenza encephalitis. Trials with
α-interferon and nasogastric ribavirin in JE in children have
revealed no benefit. Specific antimalarial therapy may also be
indicated if suspicion of cerebral malaria exists.
Minocycline is a semisynthetic penicillin which has
neuroprotective properties. It has excellent penetration in
the cerebrospinal fluid. Besides its direct effects on non-viral
pathogens, it has been shown to have antiviral, anti-apoptotic
and anti-inflammatory actions with significant benefit in
animal models of viral encephalitis. There may be a role of
minocycline in AES even of undetermined etiology and human
trials with this agent are underway.

Clinical Pearl
• Tuberculous meningitis (TMB) usually has a subacute onset.
Here the prodromal stage with nonspecific symptoms will be
longer than a week. If the child is comatose and computed
tomography scan does not show hydrocephalus it is unlikely
to be TBM; presence of basal exudates and/or granulomas is
suggestive of TBM while subdural collections are suggestive
of bacterial meningitis. Cerebral malaria is a multisystem illness
with acute onset of high fever, chills and rigors, bilateral upper
motor neurone signs, anemia, hemoglobinuria and normal
cerebrospinal fluid.

Approach to Pediatric
Movement Disorders
PA M Kunju, Anoop K Verma

INTRODUCTIOn
Movement disorders are characterized by abnormal or excessive
involuntary movements that may result in abnormalities in
posture, tone, balance, or fine motor control. It is often used
synonymously with basal ganglia or extra­pyramidal disease but
it does not adequately describe all the movement disorders.
Basically movement disorders are characterized as akinetic
rigid syndrome and hyperkinetic or dyskinetic syndrome. In
akinetic syndrome there, is slowness or paucity of movement,
for example, parkinsonism, (this particular disorder is rare in
pediatric age group). In dyskinetic syndrome, there is excessive
movement, e.g., chorea, athetosis, ballismus, tremor, dystonia,
tics, and other stereotypic behavior.

How They Differ in Children
Movement disorders in childhood are a heterogeneous
group of diseases with presentations that vary according to
etiopathogenesis and age of onset. Involuntary movements can
represent the sole disease manifestation, or they may be one of
many symptoms and signs of other systemic disorder. While
sharing certain characteristics with the conditions that affect
adults, they also have unique features that are determined
by the metabolic, physiological, and environmental
distinctiveness of the developing brain. So they show some
particular characteristics:
• An increased occurrence of hyperkinetic movements,
rather than bradykinesia or rigidity
• A higher frequency of transient motor phenomena in the
first year of life
• A higher prevalence of paroxysmal movement disorders
• A major primary etiology for chronic motor dysfunction
being residue of static encephalopathy
• A greater likelihood that symptoms are secondary to
hereditary metabolic disorders
• An evolving pattern of movements associated with
metabolic disorders.
Some of the common benign movement disorders that have to
be ruled out in infancy are:

Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus
Benign myoclonus of infancy
Jitteriness
Shuddering attacks
Paroxysmal tonic upgaze of infancy
Spasmus nutans
Benign paroxysmal torticollis
Benign idiopathic dystonia of infancy.

CATEGORIZATION OF MOVEMENT DISORDER
If we categorize the movement disorder according to the level
of involvement at the brain, it can be summarized as per the
following algorithm 1.
The structures responsible for motor control are upper
motor neuron (UMN), lower motor neuron (LMN), cerebellar
circuitry, basal ganglia circuitry, motor activation cortex, and
sensory cortex. Virtually the entire nervous system is engaged
in motor control.
The basal ganglia consist of five large subcortical nuclei that
are the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia
nigra, and subthalamic nuclei. Bradykinesia is related to insult
at substantia nigra, ballismus to subthalamic nucleus, dystonia
to putamen, and chorea to caudate nucleus, but overlaps are
also seen.

Clinical Pearls
• Movement disorder and seizures can be differentiated by the
preservation of consciousness
• Except ballism movement disorders stop during sleep
• Video recording using mobile phones will help in identifying
the type of abnormal movements.

PHENOMENOLOGY OF
MOVEMENT DISORDERS
Phenomenology refers to the clinically observable aspects
of movement disorder, and one must be able to identify, the

characteristic of each movement disorder as each of them has
a different character (Table 1).

Clinical Pearl
• Movement disorders can be grouped according to the speed
of movement
• Fastest being myoclonus, slightly slower will be ballism, then
chorea, then athetosis, and slowest dystonia.
Table 1: Charecteristics of movement disorders

Ch-94.indd 449

Movement
disorder

Brief description

Chorea

Chorea is rapid jerky, large amplitude involuntary
movements of proximal more than distal muscles

Athetosis

Slower writhing irregular movements predomi­
nantly in the hands and wrist

Dyskinesia

General term for abnormal movement; however,
commonly denotes movements of mouth and face,
usually drug induced (orofacial dyskinesia)

Dystonia

Cocontraction of agonist and antagonist, which
lead to an intermittent or persistent maintenance
of abnormal posture

Hemiballis­
mus

Violent flinging movements, which are irregular
affecting one side

Myoclonus

Sudden shock-like contraction of a muscle or a
group of muscle leading to involuntary purposeless
jerk of affected limb

Ataxia

Ataxia is inability to control movements and
typically is caused by cerebellar dysfunction

Tics

Tics are rapid, complex, nonvoluntary, repetitive
segmental movements. Simple tics last less than 6
months. Chronic tics last longer than 6 months

Tourette
syndrome

There are motor tics and vocalizations lasting longer
than 12 months, start between 2 and 10 years of age,
and may fluctuate in severity over time

Tremor

Rhythmic oscillation about a certain point or
position involving one or more body part

Stereotypies

Stereotypies are repetitive, patterned involuntary
movements that have no apparent function

GENERAL APPROACH TO
MOVEMENT DISORDERS
Evaluation of movement disorders, like all neurologic
symptoms, begins with a comprehensive history:
• Patient’s gestation, detailed birth history, early develop­
ment, previous illnesses, drug history, exposure to potential
toxins, and social and family history, are often essential for
proper classification
• The key questions to be asked are as follows:
{{ What is the distribution? (e.g., orofacial—chorea)
{{ Is it unilateral or generalized? (e.g., Hemidystonia
associated with structural lesion)
{{ What is the speed of movement—fast (excessive
movement, hyperkinetic) or slow (paucity of move­
ment, hypokinetic)?
{{ Is it rhythmic or is it jerky? (e.g., rhythmic—tremor;

Clinical Pearl
• Video of abnormal movement is important which can
supple­ment witnessing the real-time abnormal movement
of the patient.

A critical feature is determining whether the presenting
signs/symptoms are an isolated disorder, associated with
other neurologic findings, part of a static condition, or

appearing in conjunction with a loss of other previously
acquired skills.
A comprehensive general examination is further required
for properly defining the movement and identifying clues
indicating a systemic problem. The category of movement
assists in localizing the pathologic process, whereas the onset,
age and degree of abnormal motor activity and associated
neurologic findings help organize the investigation. Correct
classification of the type of movement disorder forms the basis
for the subsequent diagnostic process.
The features of movement disorders are discussed in
table 2.
Thus, compiling the important pieces of information from
history and examination, the strategy is to reach the diagnosis
from recognizing the patterns based on phenomenology
and then focus on the causes as possible etiologies for acute,
subacute onset and acquired causes.

There are various movement disorders which are caused due to
adverse effects of medications or drugs. They are summarized
in table 3.
Before discussing the individual movement disorders,
it would be prudent to take a look at the inherited disorders
causing movement disorders (Table 4).

The category of movement assists in localizing the
pathologic process, whereas the onset, age and degree of
abnormal motor activity and associated neurologic findings
help to organize the investigation. Correct classification of the
type of movement disorder forms the basis for the subsequent
diagnostic process.
No specific biological marker is available:
• Many diagnostic tests are available but these are often
expensive, time-consuming or invasive
• The diagnostic value of these tests is often limited,
especially in early stages of the disease.
The investigational workup can be greatly simplified once
the type of movement disorder has been defined properly.

INVESTIGATIONS
The investigations in movement disorders can be divided

immuno­logical, or other investigations as applicable. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) brain is the neuro­imaging modality
of choice in pediatric movement disorders and the following
algorithm 3 proves a good guide to diagnosis.

Clinical Pearl
• Magnetic resonance imaging will help in identifying various
disorders. Basal ganglia calcification can be due to Fahr

INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENT DISORDERS
Following is a short discussion of movement disorders.

11/24/2016 2:17:06 PM

Chapter 94: Approach to Pediatric Movement Disorders

Dystonia
Though dystonia is a common symptom in neurology, it is
being recognized less frequently by pediatricians.
•

Definition
Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized
by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing
abnormal (often repetitive) movements, postures, or both. The
factor which distinguishes myoclonus, chorea, athetosis, and
dystonia would be the variable speed of movement; fastest
being myoclonus, 50–100 ms and slowest one being dystonia,
which may last at least a second.
Dystonia evolves in a focal manner and during voluntary
activity—“action dystonia”.

Pathophysiology
Dystonia is a circuit disorder, historically thought to arise
from basal ganglia but now recognized to result from injury or
malfunction in any of the several nodes within the motor cortex.

Classification
The dystonias are classified according to their distribution, age
of onset, type of onset, and etiology.

Distribution
•

Focal
When dystonia is confined to anyone single region:
–– Ocular muscles: Blepharospasm
–– Tongue: Lingual dystonia
–– Vocal cord: Dystonic dysphonia
–– Mouth: Oromandibular dystonia
–– Neck: Torticollis
–– Hand: Writer’s cramp (Fig. 1)
Segmental
{{ When focal dystonia spreads to contiguous area:
–– Cranial: Face and neck
{{

•

•

Type of Onset
It is broadly divided in to four groups:
1 Acute dystonia
2 Tardive dystonia
3 Paroxysmal dystonia
4 Chronic nonprogressive/progressive dystonia.

Acute dystonia
Acute dystonia arise from neuroleptic drugs, exposure to toxins,
infections, and certain familial disorders. Acute reactions can
appear soon after starting treatment with phenothiazine, or
even promethazine. Manifestations include bizarre postures
of face (sustained grimacing), eyes (oculogyric crisis), jaw
(trismus, mandibular dystonia), tongue (lingual dystonia),
neck (torticollis), trunk (scoliosis, lordosis, kyphosis, and
opisthotonos) and limbs (torsion spasm). These may be
confused with seizure, tetany or encephalitis if a proper history
of drug ingestion is not obtained.
The acute dystonic reactions may be the result of excess
dopaminergic activity. Response to treatment of acute dystonia
is often dramatic. Anticholinergic drugs like diphenhydramine
or promethazine will reverse the acute dystonia within
minutes. We have seen transient dyskinesia in asthmatic
patients receiving theophylline. Interaction of theophylline
and hypoxemia with other factors may induce this.

–– Childhood or adolescent onset
–– Beginning in the lower limbs

Section 11: Neurology

Clinical Pearl
Acute dystonias can be remembered by VITS:

• V—Vascular (infarct; hemorrhage, etc.)
• I—Infection and post-infectious, e.g., Japanese encephalitis;
autoimmune encephalitis
• T—Toxin (drugs like phenothiazine toxicity)
• S—Space occupying lesion (subacute)

Tardive dystonia
It is a separate entity from acute dystonic reactions in that
it is persistent, does not show response to intravenous
diphenhydramine or anticholinergics. Another striking feature
is the distribution of dystonic movement. Generalized dystonia
is more in younger individuals whereas in older subjects it has
a more restricted distribution.

Paroxysmal dystonia
A group of interesting disorders which may be confused with
seizures:
• Familial paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis: This rare
bizarre paroxysmal movements occurring in an auto­somal
dominant manner. Each attack is characterized by (a)
painful spasm of affected musculature, (b) choreoathetosis
and (c) return to normality
• Paroxysmal kinesigenic dystonia: Sudden movement or
startle and stress will precipitate an attack. These patients
can avert an attack by avoiding abrupt movement and
sensory stimuli
• Exercise induced paroxysmal dystonia: A paroxysmal
dystonic choreoathetosis, which is seen after continued
exercise or by sensory stimuli but not after a sudden
movement
• Paroxysmal hypnogenic dystonia: Certain varieties of
dystonia may be brought on by sleep. In addition to the
idiopathic variety, we have seen paroxysmal dystonias
due to intracranial tumor, hyperthyroidism and transient
ischemic attacks.
Recently following genetic associations are found with
paroxysmal movement disorders. Paroxysmal kinesigenic
dyskinesia due to PRRT2 mutations (DYT10); paroxysmal
nonkinesigenic dyskinesias (DYT8) with mutations in the
PNKD (also known as MR-1) gene; and exertion-induced
dyskinesia (DYT18) with SLC2A1 mutations.

Primary dystonia
In the past 20 years, monogenic defects have been found to
underlie many forms of dystonia. Monogenic forms of isolated
dystonia are referred to as DYTs.
• Idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD)/Dystonia musculorum
deformans (DMD): Autosomal dominant dystonia gene is
found to be located on chromosome 9q34. The usual age of
onset is 5–15 years with dystonia of legs and within 5–10
years disease reach to maximum level of disability. At that
time they are twisted axially with contorted oromandibular,
neck, trunk, and limb musculature.
• Dopa-responsive dystonia: This group of patients with
dystonia respond dramatically to a very low dosage of
levodopa. Features include onset of dystonia before the age
of 16, onset in the legs or with gait, and often having features
of parkinsonism. Inheritance is autosomal dominant.
Since the demonstration of dopa-sensitive dystonic states,
levodopa has been tried in some of the cases of the congenital
cerebral palsy where choreoathetotic rigidity is seen.
• Diurnal dystonia (Segawa syndrome): Relatively free of
dystonic movements and postures in the morning and
be afflicted severely in the late afternoon. Segawa had
described this type of dystonia and we have seen many
with similar involvement and who showed dramatic
response to levodopa. . The disease is caused by a GTP
cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH) deficiency. Genetic mutations in
the tetrahydrobiopterin synthetic pathway, specifically the
GCH1 gene (DYT 5) in the autosomal-dominant variant,
and the TH gene in the autosomal recessive form, are
responsible for the condition.

Clinical Pearls
• Common cause of nonprogressive dystonia is dyskinetic
cerebral palsy due to kernicterus or birth asphyxia (Fig. 2)
• However, in such cases a dose of levodopamine must be tried
to rule-out diurnal dystonia (Segawa syndrome), which is an
eminently treatable condition.

Secondary dystonias

Treatment: Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis responds
to phenytoin. Other varieties may respond to clonazepam,
L-tryptophan and carbamazepine.

Secondary dystonia can be due to congenital, hereditary,
metabolic, vascular, infection, degeneration, demyelination,
tumor, drugs, toxins, etc.
Useful clinical pointers to suggest a secondary dystonia:
• History to suggest involvement of other organ systems, e.g.,
liver (Wilson’s disease), multiple system (systemic lupus
erythematosus)
• Coexistent neurological signs indicating involvement of
higher mental, retinal, pyramidal, or LMN function
• History of exposure to antipsychotic drugs, toxins, injury,
or cerebrovascular disorders.

Chronic nonprogressive/progressive dystonias

Treatment

Etiology: Dystonias are divided into two types on the basis of
etiology as follows:

Treatable dystonic conditions like Wilson’s disease, tardive
dystonias, etc. have to be considered first.

Clinical Pearl
• Paroxysmal movement disorders (PD) may resemble
seizures but will respond to antiepileptic drugs like
phenytoin, carbamazepine (kinesgenic PD), or clonazepam
(nonkinesegenic PD)

Rigidity
A form of hypertonia in which resistance to passive movement
is present at low speeds, does not depend on the speed and
does not exhibit a speed or threshold angle.

Hallmarks of Rigidity

tremor in children)
• Dopa-responsive dystonia
• Dystonic cerebral palsy.

Stereotypy
Described as repeated, purposeless movements
Divided into two groups:
1. Primary, indicating a physiologic basis, and
2. Secondary, for those associated with other neuro­
developmental problems like:
{{ Pervasive developmental disability—Autism spectrum
disorders, Rett syndrome
{{ Intellectual retardation
{{ Sensory deprivation—congenital blindness/deafness
{{ Inborn errors of metabolism—Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
{{ Genetic—Neuroacanthocytosis.
Tics are different from stereotypies which can be
reproduced voluntarily and the patient has partial control.
They do not interfere with voluntary activity.

Myoclonus
Definition
It is an involuntary muscle jerk which cannot be suppressed
and generally with no premonitory features. It can be isolated
though uncommon in children or a symptom of other disorders.
In children it should be evaluated for epileptic myoclonus.

Types
Myoclonus can be subdivided according to the anatomic
origin:
• Cortical: Originates from the sensorimotor cortex. Seen as
focal, distal and arrthymic movement usually seen in the
arms or trunk. It can be spontaneous or induced by action.
Examples: progressive myoclonic epilepsies, Angelman’s
syndrome, Huntington’s disease, Rett’s syndrome, etc.
• Subcortical: Seen with injury to thalamus or brainstem.
Examples: palatal myoclonus, hyperekplexia, etc.
• Spinal: Duration is longer and more variable than cortical
or subcortical myoclonus. Examples: post-trauma,
ischemic myelopathy, etc.
• Peripheral: Peripheral nerves lesions where sensory input
is affected. They are typically arrthymic and non-stimulus
sensitive. Example: hemifacial spasm.
Physiological myoclonus is much more common and
should be differentiated from pathological causes. The
common types of physiological myoclonus include benign
neonatal sleep myoclonus and benign myoclonus of infancy.

Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia Syndrome
(“Dancing Eyes, Dancing Feet”)
It is a rare but a dramatic, autoimmune disorder most commonly
seen between 1 and 5 years.

Etiology
In children, 50% are associated with neuroblastoma and
majority of nonneoplastic remain idiopathic but presumed
postinfectious.

Clinical presentation
Presents with robust myoclonus and opsoclonus seen as
multidirectional, darting, chaotic, conjugate eye movements.

Ch-94.indd 457

Excessive irritability, sleep disturbances, and mutism are
common.

Diagnosis
It is essentially a clinical diagnosis but neuroblastoma
screening is mandatory.

Prognosis and treatment
Neurologic outcome is unfavorable and a significant affected
are left with motor and cognitive sequelae. Treatment includes
immunosuppression and supportive medication for sleep and
behavior disruption.

Key points

))
Establishing phenomenology is key to diagnosis to movement
disorder

Afebrile Encephalopathy: Bedside Approach to
Diagnosis and Management
Lokesh Lingappa, Sirisharani Siddaiahgari

INTRODUCTION
Encephalopathy sets in with diffuse cerebral involvement,
bilateral thalamic or ascending reticular activating system
pathology. In children, diffuse cerebral involvement is the
most common pathology leading to altered sensorium. A
study by the California Encephalitis Project on epidemiology
and etiology of encephalitis found that 63% of the patients
remained without an etiology after a battery of tests for 16
potential infectious agents. The situation is much more
difficult in the developing world in view of limited viral
testing facilities.
Any child with encephalopathy needs to be evaluated for
presence of an infectious etiology. This can be because of direct
infection by the organism or part of systemic inflammatory
response syndrome. Once these possibilities are ruled out one
needs to consider other etiologies. Absence of fever during
an infection may be due to immunocompromised states
(including acquired and inherited immunodeficiency state,
drug induced immunosuppression), chronic kidney disease,
chronic liver disease, etc.

Approximately 30–70% of acute encephalopathies do
not receive etiologic diagnoses. Many of them might have an
autoimmune basis some easily diagnosable and some still
challenging. Most of them present acutely in pediatric practice.
They can be broadly classified as infective pathology; the
noninfective pathology consists of a wide range of etiologies
(Table 1).

Ch-95.indd 458

Clinical Pearl
• History from parents or adult person present at onset of altered
sensorium is very important to generate appropriate differential
diagnoses (80% of diagnoses are suspected based on history).

VARIED ETIOLOGIES AND
THEIR BRIEF PRESENTATION Algorithm 1
Metabolic
Inborn errors of metabolism: in infants and young children
presenting with encephalopathy one of the important etiology
would be inborn errors of metabolism. Most present before age
of two years, except few organic acidurias which may present
later on.
Small molecule diseases (amino acid disorders, fatty
acid oxidation disorders, organic acidurias, and urea cycle
disorders) present with encephalopathy, symmetric motor
signs. They have presence of increased anion gap metabolic
acidosis along with variable hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia,
lactic acidemia, and ketones.
Presence of metabolic acidosis with variable lactic
acidosis and hypoglycemia and ketosis would point toward
organic acidurias. Evidence of bone marrow suppression with
bicytopenia also is manifestation of org anic aciduria.
Child presenting with nonketotic hypoglycemia especially
in early morning hours with or without hepatomegaly and
anicteric hepatitis would strongly point toward the presence
of underlying fatty acid oxidation disorder. Medium chain Acyl
Co A dehydrogenase deficiency is the most common followed
by carnitine palmitoyl 1A deficiency.

Clinical Pearl
• In fatty acid oxidation disorder hepatomegaly and elevation
of liver enzymes may evolve over initial days and may not be
seen at presentation.

Urea cycle disorder will have variable presentations
including encephalopathy, recurrent vomiting in association
with hyperammonemia. Newborn presentation with progres­
sive encephalopathy and abnormalities on magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) brain with restricted diffusion on brainstem is
suggestive of maple syrup urine disease.

Clinical Pearl
• Ammonia levels need to be processed immediately and to
be transported on ice to the laboratory for accurate results.
Borderline elevation of ammonia is usually due to delayed
processing of samples

Stepwise decompensation in infancy with presence of
breathing difficulty and lactic acidosis needs consideration
of mitochondrial disorder. Neuroimaging demonstrating
bilateral basal ganglia hypodensities on computed
tomography of brain along with involvement of peri­
aqueductal gray matter suggests Leigh’s disease. Magnetic
resonance imaging with MRI spectroscopy with elevated
lactate and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate further
confirm the diagnoses.

Clinical Pearl
• It is imperative that in an infant or young child less than 3 years
with unexplained encephalopathy with or without acidosis
and hypoglycemia, samples (tandem mass spectroscopy,
lactate and ammonia, urine for organic acids,) should be taken
before starting vitamin cocktails

 Algorithm 1

An EDTA sample should be stored in case of sudden
death and further pregnancy counseling can be possible after
performing appropriate genetic analysis.

Acquired: Hepatic/Uremic/Others
Hepatic Encephalopathy
Spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with
liver dysfunction are characterized by personality changes,
intellectual impairment, and depressed level of consciousness.
The diagnosis is usually given away by presence of icterus,
significant elevation of liver enzymes, and in few children with
history of pre-existing liver disease.
Uremic encephalopathy may be more challenging to
diagnose. Hypertension would be an independent risk factor
for encephalopathy. Short stature, anemia, hypertension,
and features of rickets would be the systemic clues to chronic
kidney disorders.

Clinical Pearl
• Early central visual impairment before losing consciousness
would be a pointer toward hypertensive emergency causing
posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome

Electrolyte Disturbances/
Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia
Children with acute gastroenteritis and endocrine disorders
can present with altered sensorium. Severe gastroenteritis
leads to sinovenous thrombosis with raised intracranial
pressure. Slow correction of hyponatremia is essential.
Hyperglycemia as first presentation or poor control of
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with
encephalopathic presentation.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with
encephalopathic presentation.

Clinical Pearl
• Normal magnetic resonance imaging brain with symmetrical
encephalopathy (encephalopathy with preserved eye
movement without lateralizing neurological findings) points
toward metabolic encephalopathy, systemic inflammatory
response syndrome and toxins. Magnetic resonance imaging
can be normal in early phases of acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis.

Inflammatory/Vasculitis
Parainfectious/Postinfectious Demyelination
In children presenting with biphasic illness, neurological
worsening with polyfocal symptoms and encephalopathy,
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a relevant

differential diagnoses. Magnetic resonance imaging brain
performed early on may be normal; most will demonstrate
changes by 5–7 days in subcortical white matter along with
deep gray nuclei especially in poststreptococcal ADEM.
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis can
also have similar presentation with minimal MRI changes.

Vasculitis/Hypertensive Encephalopathy/
Vascular Etiologies
Adolescent age group especially in girls presenting with multi­
system involvement and focal neurological presentation or
diffuse encephalopathy consider systemic vasculitis disorder.
Neuroimaging might provide the directions for vasculitic
pathology or elevated ESR might suggest the underlying
etiologic process.

Autoimmune Pathologies
Children present with neuro­logical syndromes associated with
serum and/or CSF antibodies directed against ion channels,
receptors and associated proteins are diagnosed as antibodymediated encephalopathies. The clinical features of these
disorders overlap and, in many cases, the etiology may not be
apparent at presentation. Investigation and treatment needs to
be ongoing in this clinical situation. Many patients present with
fever, seizures, amnesia, confusion, and psychiatric features,
and some develop encephalopathy with a movement disorder.

Clinical Pearl
• Presence of characteristic movement disorder with perioral
dyskinesia and dystonia is the usual key to diagnoses of
N-methyl-D-aspartate encephalitis with no diagnostic cerebro­
spinal fluid or magnetic resonance imaging brain findings.

In some the encephalopathy can be part of a para­
neoplastic syndrome. Majority of children do not have
detectable tumors except in adolescent girls who harbor
ovarian teratoma.
Autoimmune encephalopathies are increasingly being
diagnosed in children with antibodies to NMDAR, and rarely
with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)complex proteins or other central nervous system antigens
such as glutamic acid decarboxylase. The clinical phenotypes
associated with these conditions are increasingly recognized
but some patients are negative for the available antibody tests.

Acquired Brain Injury
Accidental/nonaccidental injury
In onset of altered sensorium is immediate in significant head
injury except in cases of epidural hematoma where symptoms
can evolve over 24 hours. An inconsistent history from different
family members and varied stages of injuries on neuroimaging
or unexplained fractures would suggest nonaccidental injury
(Tables 2 to 5).

MANAGEMENT
Management of acute encephalopathy involves stabili­
zation of airway, breathing, and circulation. Start treatment
for infection with antibiotics and antiviral medications
as appropriate. Symptomatic treatment of seizures and
management of raised intracranial pressure is essential.
Ongoing monitoring on vital parameters and endorgan functions are essential part of treating a child with
encephalopathy. Once accurate etiology is established the
management will have to focus and unwarranted medications
can be withdrawn.
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis responds
to immunomodulation and even the severe motor disability
improves significantly. First-line immunotherapy includes
steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. If there is no
response, rituximab once a week for 4 weeks improves the
condition. It is imperative to monitor CD20 levels during
therapy. Acute disseminated encephalopathy usually responds
to methylprednisolone followed by oral steroids in most.
Outcomes are dependent on etiology and severity of
pathology. Ongoing counseling of family and involving them
in important decision-making will help to reduce the stress on
the treating team and the family.

Approach to Rickets in Children
S Thangavelu, M Vijayakumar

Introduction
Rickets is caused by defective mineralization of growing bones
resulting in bony deformities. Vitamin D deficiency is the
most common cause of rickets. Rickets, like illness can occur
in wide variety of other disorders like renal tubular disorders,
chronic liver disease, and some metabolic disorders. Clinical
appearance is similar, but after biochemical evaluation, one
can differentiate one from the other.
Nutritional rickets being common in the past, the
traditional practice consisted and still consists of treating every
child having rickets with vitamin D, particularly stoss therapy
using high dose of intramuscular D3. Then child is reevaluated
clinically and radiologically after 6 weeks and 12 weeks. In a
fair number of cases, the decision of non-nutritional rickets is
made only after 12 weeks. Gradually this scenario has changed
to complete evaluation to a specific diagnosis so as to decide on
need for vitamin D. This is possible because of the availability
of sophisticated investigations and subspecialty consults
like pediatric nephrology, gastroenterology, and metabolic
specialists. Here, the process is completed in a short time of 5–7
days. But in peripheral areas and in the absence of adequate
laboratory and subspecialty facilities, the traditional method is
still an ideal one. Specific management differs according to the
underlying illness. Most of them present with symptomatology
of delayed walking or bony deformities. Head to foot clinical
examination may reveal following findings.

clinical examination
Head
Features include craniotabes, delayed closure of anterior
fontanel, and frontal and parietal bossing leading to box-like
appearance of head known as caput quadratum. Delayed
eruption of primary teeth, enamel defects, and caries teeth are
the dental abnormalities.

ch-96.indd 463

Thorax
Palpable and visible knobby enlargement of costochondral
junctions are called rachitic rosary (Fig. 1A). Harrison’s sulcus
(Fig. 1B) is the horizontal depression along the lower part of
chest corresponding to the costal attachment of diaphragm
due to traction on the rib cage. This may also be associated with
pectus carinatum or violin-shaped chest. In severe forms and
untreated cases, spinal and pelvic deformities can occur.

Extremities
Palpable and visible knobby enlargement of long bones around
wrists and ankles (double malleoli) are present. Weight bearing
can lead to bow legs, knock knees, and anterior curving of
legs, coxa vera, and greenstick fractures. Deformities of spine,
pelvis, and leg results in short stature called ”rachitic dwarfism”
(Fig. 1C). Lower extremities are almost always more extensively
involved than upper extremities in familial hypophosphatemic
rickets (FHR), whereas upper limb involvement is more
pronounced in hypocalcemic rickets.

General
Pot belly abdomen can be pressent (Fig. 1D). Motor symptoms
are more common with hypocalcemic rickets whereas
motor symptoms are usualy absent in predominantly hypo­
phosphatemic rickets. One can approach rickets in children
through the following algorithm (Algorithm 1).

METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
Though there are many clinical findings, bony changes
such as enlarged bony ends are the striking clinical
features and they form the center point of clinical differen­
tiation. Few conditions closely mimic rickets clinically as
well as radiologically. They are (i) metaphyseal dysplasia,
(ii) hypophosphatasia, and (iii) mucopolysaccharidosis.

 Algorithm 1
Algorithmic approach to rickets in children

Do preliminary investigations like serum calcium, phos­
phorous, serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), and have a
close look at the X-rays. Though rickets like states such as
hypophosphatasia (caution: not hypo­phospha­temia) and
metaphyseal dysplasia are far rarer than rickets, it is wise to
confirm the diagnosis of rickets before proceeding further.
This will avoid unnecessary therapy with vitamin D.

Clinical Features and Radiological Signs
Suggestive of Metaphyseal Dysplasia
Clinical and radiological signs are similar to rickets but
with subtle difference. Here, growth plate is not wide with
differential involvement of bones in a joint, e.g., femur
shows radiological changes, but tibia is normal. Biochemical
investigations, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate and
alkaline phosphatase, are normal.

Chapter 96: Approach to Rickets in Children
into metaphysis whereas in rickets growth plate is uniformly
wide. Biochemical changes will be different from rickets as
SAP levels are low and serum calcium and phosphate levels
are normal.

Clinical Pearl
• Metaphyseal dysplasia and hypophosphatasia can
be confused with rickets in children. In metaphyseal
dysplasia, serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and alkaline
phosphatase are normal and there will be differential
involvement of bones in a joint. In hypophosphatasia,
biochemical changes will be different from rickets as serum
alkaline phosphate levels are low and serum calcium and
phosphate levels are normal.

NUTRITIONAL RICKETS
Nutritional rickets is reappearing in large numbers all over
the world. Inadequate exposure to sunlight, lack of dietary
or vitamin supplements, and deficiency of vitamin D in
breastfeeding mothers are important reasons. This being
a disease of growing children, nutritional rickets usually

ch-96.indd 465

appears between the age group of 6 months to 2 years. Any
child presenting beyond this age group, involvement of
more than one family member, and associated failure to
thrive or failure of adequate vitamin D therapy to correct
rickets indicates the diagnosis of non-nutritional rickets.
Differentiation is important because non-nutritional rickets
needs extensive biochemical evaluation and specialist’s
opinion. Diagnosis and management of nutritional rickets
is straightforward, but in non-nutritional rickets, it is
complicated and needs prolonged therapy. In nutritional
rickets, 25-hydroxy vitamin D level will be low and other
associated features include low serum calcium, phosphate,
and high alkaline phosphatase with elevated serum levels
of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Radiological changes are
observed in ends of long bones such as knees or wrist.
Classical radiological changes of rickets are absence of zone
of provisional cartilaginous calcifications and widening,
fraying and cupping (concavity) of the distal ends of shaft.
But some studies indicate the lack of correlation between
low serum levels of vitamin D and presence of radiological
changes. Despite very low levels, no radiological changes are
observed in some (Figs 2A to C).

Section 12: Nephrology

Clinical Pearl
• Vitamin D deficiency rickets previously called as nutritional
rickets will show healing after adequate vitamin D therapy.
Rickets without obvious clues definitely needs serum vitamin D
level assessment at whatever age they are presenting to us.
One should note that even before healing rickets is seen in the
X-rays, the elevation of serum phosphate level from its original
low level will give us clue that we are dealing with vitamin D
deficiency rickets only.

NON-NUTRITIONAL RICKETS
Among the non-nutritional causes, three common causes are
seen. Most commonly renal, next gastrointestinal, and third
are miscellaneous causes. Sometimes obvious clues may be
identified which will lead to the diagnosis of the under­lying
cause.

Etiology with Clues
History of prematurity and lack of vitamin D supplementation,
neonatal cholestasis, chronic renal failure, or child taking
anticonvulsant therapy are obvious clues. One should look
for leading points in the history and examination in a child
with rickets like positive family history which is common in
metabolic diseases and in renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
• Jaundice may be a clue toward hepatobiliary disease,
metabolic disorders, and tyrosinemia
• Cataract and rickets are seen in galactosemia, Wilson’s
disease, and Lowe syndrome
• Mental retardation and seizures are seen in Lowe
syndrome, galactosemia, and in primary central nervous
system problem with drug-induced rickets.
At this stage, one should differentiate between two causes:
(i) gastrointestinal including hepatobiliary and (ii) renal
causes.

GastrointestinaL Causes
Features Indicating Gastrointestinal
Etiology (Particularly Malabsorption
Disorders Leading to Rickets)
History: recurrent diarrhoea, oily stools, abdominal pain, and
distention
Examination: anemia, hypoproteinemia, multiple vitamin and
mineral deficiencies, and failure to thrive.
Laboratory features: vitamin D deficiency, low phosphate,
calcium may be normal or low with raised PTH.

Features Indicating Hepatobiliary
Disorder Leading to Rickets
466

ch-96.indd 466

Clinical features: jaundice, pale stools, oily stools, high colored
urine and hepatomegaly,
Laboratory features: raised serum total and direct bilirubin,
raised hepatic enzymes, low serum albumin, and prolonged
prothrombin time.

RENAL CAUSES
Clinical and Laboratory Features
Indicating Renal Etiology Leading to Rickets
Clinical features: recurrent vomiting, failure to thrive, lethargy,
acidotic breathing, and presence of underlying renal disorders
are indicative of renal etiology.
When renal cause is suspected, investigations play a major
role in confirming or excluding them. Four renal diseases
constitute the following causes: (i) RTA, (ii) hypophosphatemic
rickets, (iii) Fanconi syndrome, and (iv) renal failure.
Among these four causes, chronic renal failure leading to
renal osteodystrophy will have the following features.
Clinical and laboratory features: vomiting, lethargy, growth
retardation, hypertension, anemia, with or without edema,
features of obstructive uropathy, raised blood urea, and
serum creatinine. Serum potassium may be normal or high.
Abnormalities in abdominal ultrasonography (USG) showing
renal anomalies, obstruction, and renomegaly or contracted
kidney can be seen. Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan showing
scars and micturiting cystourethrogram showing vesicoureteric
reflux should be noted in specific situations.
If there is no renal failure, one of the other three renal
problems are considered: RTA, Fanconi syndrome, or FHR.
History, examination, and laboratory features suggestive of
RTA: recurrent vomiting and diarrhea with acidotic breathing
associated with positive family history is common. Metabolic
acidosis with low serum bicarbonate, low serum pH, normal
serum anion gap, hypokalemia, and raised serum chloride are
usually seen. Normal blood urea and serum creatinine with no
proteinuria or glycosuria is noted.
History, examination, and laboratory features suggestive
of Fanconi syndrome: clinically severe form of rickets with
stunting and deformity and features mentioned in RTA are
seen. Aminoaciduria, glycosuria, and phosphaturia are
present. Usually normal blood urea and serum creatinine or
minimally increased blood urea and serum creatinine can be
seen. Features of underlying causes such as cystinosis and
Wilson’s disease may be present.
History, examination, and laboratory features suggestive of
familial hypophosphatemic rickets: prominent lower limb
deformity with stunted growth and often with family history is
noted. Frequent dental abscess and early decay are common.
Low serum phosphate and low tubular reabsorption of
phosphate are documented.
If clinical, laboratory features are not suggestive of any one
of the above-mentioned conditions leading to rickets, then one
of the following diagnoses discussed in the next section is likely.

Clinical Pearl
• Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is different from other forms
of renal rickets though included in them, as it designates
alteration in skeletal growth and remodeling that occurs in
children with chronic renal disease, because of alteration in
bone and mineral metabolism. Even treatment for ROD is not
straight forward therapy for vitamin D defects alone.

Chapter 96: Approach to Rickets in Children

Vitamin D-dependent rickets Type 1
History, examination, and laboratory features suggestive of
VDDR type 1: often presents in early infancy with afebrile
seizures and hypocalcemic tetany with or without radiological
changes. The differentiating feature from vitamin D deficiency
is improvement with vitamin D therapy and recurrence
of symptoms after stopping the therapy. In this situation,
estimating vitamin D metabolites will be very useful. Here,
serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D] levels will be normal,
unlike in vitamin D deficiency. But 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D
level is low despite normal or high 25(OH) D indicating that
there is defective conversion. In vitamin D-dependent rickets
type 1, the pathology is defect in 1 a-hydroxylation.

Vitamin D-dependent rickets Type 2
History, examination, and laboratory features suggestive of
VDDR type 2: these children may present with or without
alopecia, in addition to features of florid rickets. Very often
they would have received one or multiple doses of vitamin
D3 as injection or in oral form, without any clinical or
radiological response. In this receptor defect, 1, 25-dihydroxy
vitamin D level is high in contrast to vitamin D-dependent
rickets type 1 and this investigation is absolutely essential for
differentiation.

Oncogenic Rickets
History, examination, and laboratory features suggestive of
oncogenous rickets: it is a rare disease, where phosphate
loss in the urine associated with mesenchymal tumors like
hemangioendothelioma or neurofibroma. They are commonly
seen in hands, feet, and abdominal sheath. Sometimes they
may be small and undetectable and rickets develops years
before tumor is apparent. Phosphate loss is due to secretion
of fibroblast growth factor. Phosphate replacement along with
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and tumor removal are the steps in
the management.

of metabolism” are done as per the clinical diagnosis suspected
at this level. Parathyroid hormone level is elevated in rickets
and is useful in determining certain forms of rickets.

Tertiary Level Investigations
Estimation of vitamin D metabolites (to differentiate VDDR
type 1 from type 2), in vitro studies to assess receptor-vitamin D
interaction (VDDR-type 2) and bone mineral content by bone
densitometry are investigations done at this stage.

Clinical Pearl
• In modern era, vitamin D level estimation in the serum is
readily available. 25-hydroxy vitamin D level should be tested
to confirm vitamin D deficiency rickets and to rule out vitamin
D deficiency itself. Even in renal osteodystrophy, estimation
of 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels should not be ignored as
treatment involves therapy with 25 hydroxy vitamin D as well.
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D levels are essential to differentiate
vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 from type 2.

MANAGEMENT
Management of rickets becomes straight forward once the
cause is found out. Table 1 outlines the management strategy
for treatment of various types of rickets in children. While
a large dose of vitamin D has been classically used to treat
rickets/vitamin D deficiency, whether slow correction over
6–10 weeks is equally or more beneficial with lesser adverse
effects is a matter of research and debate at present. The
present recommendations are given in table 1.

features warrant.

Basic Investigations to Confirm Rickets
Serum calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase, X-rays
of ends of long bones such as knee or wrist are the basic
investigations in any child with rickets.

• Traditional therapy: vitamin D 10,000 IU/kg IM is
given and then X-ray repeated after 4–6 weeks. If
radio­logical healing is seen, then switched to daily
maintenance. If no improvement second stat dose
may be needed
• Recent guidelines for therapy: *Oral preparations
preferred over IM. Though daily dose is preferred,
for practical reasons, stoss therapy can be used
{{< 3 months – large oral dose not recommended
{{3–12 months – one single oral dose 50,000 units
{{12 months to 12 years – 150,000 IU (50,000
weekly three doses)
{{12 years – 3,00,000 IU (50,000 weekly six doses)

VDDR type 1

• 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (0.25–1.0 mg/day orally)

VDDR type 2

• 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 or 1 a-hydroxy vitamin
D3 (6 mg/day or a total of 30–60 mg orally per day)
with supplemental calcium

Renal tubular
acidosis (RTA)

• Alkali therapy: 3–5 mEq/kg/day in distal RTA and
5–15 mEq/kg/day in proximal RTA
• Supplements of potassium as per serum
potassium levels

Second Level Investigations
Blood urea, creatinine, electrolytes, arterial blood gas analysis,
and tubular reabsorption of phosphate are second level
investigations. Urine analysis for glucose, protein, specific
gravity, and anion gap are needed. Liver function test, USG
abdomen, investigation for malabsorption, and ”inborn errors

confirms vitamin D deficiency, but a low 1,25-dihydroxy
vitamin D in the background of a raised 25-hydroxy vitamin
D level confirms the diagnosis of vitamin D-dependent type 1
rickets. But in a child with clinical features of rickets and
alopecia, raised 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D level is diagnostic
of vitamin D-dependent type 2 or end organ receptor defect

Disorders of
Sodium and Potassium
Sushmita Banerjee

INTRODUCTION
Sodium (Na+) is the major extracellular cation in the body,
whereas potassium (K+) is the main intracellular cation. Their
location across the cell membrane is maintained by the Na+/
K+-adenosine triphosphatase pump, which by an active
process extrudes Na+ from the cell and pushes K+ into the cell.
Sodium balance occurs in close conjunction with water
balance, with the same homeostatic pathways causing parallel
changes in Na+ and water. The mechanisms of Na+ and K+
balance are also closely interlinked and both are dependent on
renal function. Boxes 1 and 2 list the common causes of Na+
and K+ balance in children.
Box 1: Etiology of sodium imbalances
Causes of hyponatremia
• Associated with reduced or normal total body water:
{{ Excess Na+ loss compared to water loss, from:
–– GIT (diarrhea, vomiting, fistulae, ileostomies)
–– Skin (burns, cystic fibrosis)
–– Kidney (tubular diseases: Bartters syndrome, Fanconi’s
syndrome, hypoaldosteronism, cerebral salt wasting)
{{ Administration of hyponatremic fluids in sick patients or
hyponatremic feeds in infants
• Associated with increased total body water:
{{ Increased levels of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, iatrogenic)
{{ Fluid overload (oliguric renal failure, excessive fluid
administration, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic cirrhosis
congenital heart failure)
Causes of hypernatremia
• Associated with normal or increased total body water:
{{ Administration of hypernatremic fluids to sick patients or
hypernatremic feeds to infants
{{ Hyperaldosteronism
• Associated with decreased total body water:
{{ Inadequate fluid administration to sick patients
{{ Fluid losses (excess water loss compared to Na+ loss): GI/renal
(diabetes insipidus, osmotic diuresis in diabetes mellitus)/skin
diseases
GIT, gastrointestinal tract; SIADH, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone secretion; GI, gastrointestinal; Na+, sodium.

ch-97.indd 469

Box 2: Etiology of potassium imbalances
Causes of hyperkalemia
• Increased total body potassium
{{ Reduced excretion: renal failure, mineralcorticoid deficiency,
type 4 renal tubular acidosis, and K+ sparing diuretics
{{ Increased intake: iatrogenic potassium administration
• Increased cell breakdown: hemolysis and tumor lysis (also
increased total body potassium)
• Increased catabolism: sepsis and burns
• Redistribution from ICF to ECF: acidosis, insulin deficiency
Causes of hypokalemia
• Reduced total body potassium:
{{ Inadequate intake, iatrogenic
{{ Renal loss: renal artery stenosis, tubular diseases,
mineralcorticoid excess, diuretics, and other drugs
{{ GIT loss: diarrhea, vomiting, fistulae, stomas
• Redistribution from ECF to ICF:
{{ Alkalosis
{{ Beta-2 agonists
{{ Insulin
{{ Periodic paralysis
ICF, intracellular fluid; ECF, extracellular fluid.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Electrolyte abnormalities are commonly seen in children
with vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. They also occur
when patients are otherwise ill and dependent on extraneous
fluid therapy to maintain balances. This is particularly
seen in pediatric intensive care unit patients who may also
have disorders of different organs and altered homeostatic
mechanisms. More rarely, electrolyte abnormalities occur due
to chronic diseases which may be genetically acquired.
The symptoms of Na+ imbalance are often nonspecific
and can include lethargy, irritability, drowsiness, confusion,
convulsions, and coma. There are often associated
abnormalities in water balance, with history of vomiting

or diarrhea and clinical features of dehydration, hypo- or
hypervolemia.
Abnormalities in K+ balance may present as an emergency
and significant hyperkalemia can cause ventricular
arrhythmias and death. Acute severe hypokalemia can
cause acute profound weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, ileus,
myopathy, and respiratory failure. Characteristic electro­
cardio­gram changes are used in monitoring of severity and
treatment. Hypokalemia is associated with appearance of U
wave, flattening of T wave, and ST depression. In hyperkalemia,
there is appearance of tall T waves, widening of QRS complex,
and disappearance of P waves.
Chronic disorders, most commonly the renal tubular
diseases, present with chronic weakness, recurrent dehydration
and fever, failure to thrive, short stature, rickets, and polyuria.
Hypertension may be associated with conditions like Liddle’s
syndrome and hyperaldosteronism. Ultimately, the diagnosis
of the specific etiology is necessary for directing specific
treatment, and for predicting long-term outcome.

•

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
Patients who are at risk of having electrolyte abnormalities,
as discussed above, should have biochemical tests including
serum Na+, K+, chloride as well as urea and creatinine levels
checked at presentation, and regularly thereafter until
resolution. Further investigations are directed according to the
specific etiology suspected. The definitions are given in table 1.

Useful Biochemical Indices in Investigation of
Sodium and Potassium Abnormalities
•

Renal sodium excretion can be measured as a spot urinary
sodium or the fractional excretion of sodium.

FeNa =

Urinary sodium × serum creatinine
× 100
Urinary creatinine × serum sodium

	  The spot urinary sodium concentration may be
unreliable and variable as it would depend on the
volume and concentration of the urine sample. The FeNa
measurement is more reliable, fairly easy to perform, and
requires a random spot urine sample with a simultaneous
blood sample. These indices are useful in:
{{ The investigation of oliguric acute renal failure, to
detect whether the etiology is prerenal or renal. In
prerenal acute renal failure due to volume depletion
and avid salt and water reabsorbtion, urinary Na+ is
low (<5–10 mg/dL in a spot sample or FeNa <1%).
A urine Na+ >40 mmol/L is strong evidence against

•

extracellular fluid (ECF) volume contraction. In acute
tubular necrosis, there is tubular damage with lack of
tubular Na+ reabsorbtion causing high urinary sodium
excretion (>20 mg/dL in a spot sample or FeNa >2.5%)
{{ In the investigation of hyponatremia, low urinary
sodium (<5–10 mg/dL in a spot sample or FeNa <1%)
indicates extrarenal sodium losses, whereas high
urinary sodium (>20 mg/dL in a spot sample or FeNa
>2.5%) indicates renal sodium loss or syndrome of
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
Plasma (P) and urine (U) osmolality: the normal threshold
for AVP release ranges from 275 to 290 mOsm/kg H2O.
Patients who are in a antidiuretic mode due to volume
depletion or increased plasma osmolality, will normally
concentrate their urine and will have U:P osmolality ratio
greater than 1. Conversely, in the diuretic mode, due to
the presence of hypervolemia or hyponatremia, dilute
urine will be produced and U:P osmolality will be less than
1. If the serum Na is below 130 mmol/L, or if the serum
osmolality is less than 270 mosm/kg H2O the urine should
be maximally dilute. These parameters are useful in the
investigation of:
{{ Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone,
where there is inappropriate arginine vasopressin
secretion causing intravascular free water excess
and dilutional hyponatremia, with inappropriately
concentrated urine. U:P osmolality is greater than 1
{{ Diabetes insipidus, where the lack of action of arginine
vasopressin causes dilute urine to persist even in the
presence of hypernatremia and dehydration. U:P ratio
is less than 1.
Urinary potassium levels of >20 mg/dL in the presence of
low serum K+ is an indication of renal K+ loss. Similarly, a
high urine potassium/creatinine ratio >15 mEq/g indicates
renal K+ loss.
Transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG): in the presence
of normal renal function, this assesses the response of the
distal tubule and collecting duct to aldosterone which is
influenced by serum potassium.

TTKG =

•

Urinary potassium × Serum osmolarity
Serum potassium × Urinary osmolarity

Normal value being 8–9. A high TTKG in the presence
of hypokalemia and indicates renal potassium loss. A low
TTKG in the presence of hyperkalemia indicates inability
of the kidneys to excrete K+, due to mineralcorticoid
deficiency or inacivity.
Renin and aldosterone levels: raised levels of both
renin and aldosterone levels occur in diseases with
primary renal Na+ and water loss, and contribute to the
development of hypokalemia (e.g., Bartter’s syndrome,
RTAs, and pseudohypoaldosteronism). Both these levels
are suppressed in Liddle’s syndrome. Primary diseases of
the adrenals associated with reduced or increased levels of
aldosterone will be associated with conversely increased or
decreased renin, respectively. The titers of these hormones
are affected by body position and stress, therefore, standard

levels are described according to body position in which
sample is taken (e.g., on 2-hour supine samples).
Note: Spurious hyponatremia (due to high serum lipids or proteins) is
unusual nowadays due to technical improvements in sodium assay.

MANAGEMENT
Hyponatremic symptoms are more marked, if the disorder
develops acutely, and occur due to fluid shift from ECF to
intracellular fluid (ICF) causing brain edema. The rate of
correction should equal assessed rate of development. Acute
symptomatic hyponatremia is corrected on an emergency basis
with hypertonic saline. However, generally, abnormal sodium
levels are corrected slowly over 48–72 hours, particularly in
conditions of chronic hyponatremia, to prevent rapid reversal
of fluid shifts from the brain cells to the ECF which can cause
a central nervous system demyelinating disorder known as
central pontine myelinosis (Algorithm 1).
Algorithm 1
Management of sodium imbalances.
A, Hyponatremia; B, Hypernatremia
A

Acute hypernatremia causes brain cell shrinkage due to
fluid shifts from ICF to ECF compartments, and in severe cases,
can cause intracerebral hemorrhage.
Hypernatremia may be associated with severe dehy­dration
and volume depletion which needs emergency correction.
However, again further Na+ correction should be slow to
prevent rapid fall in ECF osmolarity which may cause reverse
fluid shift into brain cells and cerebral edema.
Sodium abnormalities in particular are often associated
with abnormalities in water balance, and the correction of
overt hypo- or hypervolemia takes precedence.

Clinical Pearls
• Sodium abnormalities are often associated with anomalies of
water balance
• In such cases, restoration of intravascular volume to normal
takes precedence.

Abnormalities in K+ balance may need to be treated on an
emergency basis, since significant hyperkalemia can cause
cardiac arrhythmias and death and severe hypokalemia can
cause weakness, muscular paralysis, and respiratory failure.
Once the acute stage is corrected, determination of etiology
allows planning of a long-term corrective therapy. Details of
treatment are given in algorithm 2.

Clinical Pearls
• In hyperkalemia, methods to shift K+ to intracellular spaces are
quick acting and should be instituted first for rapid effect
• Methods to remove K+ from the body take time but are
effective in the long term.

Algorithm 2
Management of potassium imbalances
The total sodium correction is calculated as: Deficit + assessed ongoing losses,
where Deficit (mmol) = (desired Na – present Na) × 0.6 × wt (kg). The change in
serum Na should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h.

B

*To calculate decrease in serum Na with 1 liter of infusate: Change in serum Na
= (infusate Na+ – serum Na+)/total body water (0.6 × wt) + 1.
Note: The change in serum Na+ should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h.
Correction should be limited to 8 mmol/L in the first 24 h and 18 mmol/L in
the first 48 h.

CONCLUSION
Sodium and potassium abnormalities occur in a large number
of acute and chronic conditions. The imbalances may be acute
and severe and need emergency treatment. Occasionally,
the etiology is chronic and requires prolonged specific and
supportive treatment with long-term monitoring and followup. A systematic clinical and biochemical work-up will usually
indicate the cause and guide directed therapy once the acute
situation is controlled.

children, and in some renal and endocrine diseases

Acute Glomerulonephritis
Noopur Singhal, Abhijeet Saha

INTRODUCTION
The term acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) defines a patho­
logical process that may manifest clinically as acute nephritic
syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, or rapidly progressive
glomerulo­
nephritis (GN). Nephritic syndrome is a clinical
syndrome defined by the association of hematuria, proteinuria,
and often arterial hypertension and renal failure.
Acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis (APIGN) includes
a large proportion of GN resulting from a variety of infectious
agents, most common being streptococci. The common
infectious agents implicated in the causation of APIGN
have been enumerated in box 1. Acute poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis (APSGN) is the prototype of APIGN
occurring due to immune complex deposition. Less common
diseases include immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy,

systemic lupus erythematosus, shunt nephritis, endocarditisassociated GN, and Wegener’s granulomatosis. Diagnostic
approach has been mentioned in algorithm 1.
In the clinical scenario of a child with edema, hyper­
tension, and oliguria, the initial evaluation must be targeted
to differentiate acute nephritis from nephrosis. Table 1 lists
important clinical and laboratory criteria to differentiate
between these two entities.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

474

Out of the estimated worldwide yearly burden of APSGN of
472,000 cases; approximately 404,000 occur in children (9.3
cases per 100,000 population). The male and female ratio is
2–3:1. The risk of nephritis in epidemics varies from 5% with
throat infections to as high as 25% with pyoderma.

Group A streptococci are most commonly typed by their
surface M proteins, which are virulence factors. They can also
be divided into two groups based on the presence or absence
of a lipoproteinase that causes serum to become opaque
(serum opacity factor). Each of these two groups contains a
characteristic group of M proteins. The opacity factor-positive
group contains the “nephritogenic” strains. Nephritogenic
strains are further subdivided into those primarily associated
with pyoderma (M47, M49, M55, M56, M57, and M 60), and
those that most often cause pharyngitis.(M1, M4, M25, and
some M12 strains).
Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is one of
the most common causes of acute kidney injury in children
of developing countries. Poor hygiene and lack of access to
medical care increases the risk in these countries.

PATHOGENESIS
The fundamental pathogenic mechanism of postinfectious GN
is believed to be the deposition of immune complexes within
the glomerular tufts. Other proposed mechanisms include
elicitation of an autoimmune response between streptococcal
components and renal components (molecular mimicry);
and alteration of a normal renal antigen eliciting autoimmune
reactivity.

CHAPTER 98: Acute Glomerulonephritis
Much of the early work on the pathogenesis of APSGN
focused on the group A-specific streptococcal M proteins
but it has now been discounted as the nephritogenic antigen
because, in addition to the increasing number of M-serotype
strains that are nephritogenic (M serotypes 1, 2, 4, 12, 18, 42,
49, 56, 57, and 60), some M-type strains are non-nephritogenic.

Nephritogenic Streptococcal Antigens
Two possible antigens being currently investigated as the
potential cause of PSGN include the nephritis-associated
plasmin receptor, identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydro­genase, and a cationic cysteine proteinase known
as strepto­coccal pyrogenic exotoxin B that is generated by
proteolysis of a zymogen precursor. Both of these fractions
are capable of activating the alternate pathway of the
complement system.
Glomerular binding and plasmin activation are considered
key pathogenic properties of these proteins. When deposited
in glomeruli, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
streptococcal cationic proteinase exotoxin B (speB), or
zymogen (whether bound by specific antibody or not), can
interact with plasmin or plasminogen to cause glomerular
damage by degrading the glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) through the activation of latent metalloproteinases
or collagenases (Fig. 1). The circulating or in situ immune
complexes can then move across the altered GBM and
accumulate as “humps” in the subepithelial space.

Immune Complex Deposition and
Complement Activation
The critical role played by an in situ immune reaction
resulting from the antibody meeting free antigen deposited
in the glomeruli was suspected by Rodriguez-Iturbe. This
possibility was emphasized by the difficulty of inducing GN
and the near impossibility of inducing subepithelial immune
deposits (humps), the prototype lesion in the APSGN, with
preformed immune complexes. Large amounts of preformed
complexes may produce GN, but this is leukocyte-mediated
and the localization of the immune deposits is largely
subendothelial.
Complement activation is a central feature in APSGN. The
alternate pathway is preferably activated as substantiated
by the serum complement profiles (low C3 and normal
C4) and immunofluorescence pattern typically comprising
of immunoglobulin G (IgG), C3, and C5. These deposits
virtually never contain the classical pathway components
C1q and C4.

Cellular Immune Mechanisms
Immunocompetent cells like macrophages and T helper cells
infiltrate the glomeruli. There is increased circulatory levels of
IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocytic chemotactic
protein-1. The infiltrating immune cells play an important role
in the development and severity of inflammation.

GBM, glomerular basement membrane; MMP, matrixmetalloproteinase; speB, streptococcal cationic proteinase exotoxin B.

Fig. 1: Possible pathogenic mechanism of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. (a) The putative nephritogenic antigens streptococcal
cationic proteinase exotoxin B (speB) or zymogen and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase are normally repelled in both their free
and antibody-bound forms by the negatively charged glomerular basement membrane (GBM); (b) However, these antigens can interact with
plasmin or plasminogen to activate procollagenase and latent matrixmetalloproteinase; (c) The active enzymes (and the nephritogenic antigen
itself, in the case of speB or zymogen) degrade the GBM, and abolish its negative charge; (d) The nephritogenic antigen and immune complexes
can then pass through the damaged GBM and form the characteristic “hump”-like deposits under the podocyte processes; (e) Damage to the
GBM also causes effacement of podocyte foot processes, which leads to loss of protein in the urine

SECTION 12: Nephrology

Autoimmune Reactivity
Though a number of autoimmune findings have been reported
in APSGN, they represent epiphenomena and do not define
a specific clinical course of the disease. Anti-IgG antibodies
are frequently seen in serum and in glomerular deposits. This
autoimmune reactivity may modulate the course of APSGN.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The primary physiological abnormality in children with
APSGN is reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to
infiltration of the GBM by inflammatory cells and reduction
in permeability of the basement membrane. The endothelial
or mesangial factors released by glomerular injury, over
expression of epithelial sodium channel and interstitial
inflammatory cells also contribute to sodium and fluid
retention by the distal tubule. Intravascular and subsequent
interstitial fluid retention leads to hypertension and edema.
Significant reductions in GFR cause azotemia, acidosis,
hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Anemia occurs as a
consequence of volume expansion and is usually normocytic
normochromic.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

476

The classical presentation of APSGN is a triad of abrupt
onset of gross hematuria, edema, and hypertension, and is
usually, but not always preceded by an episode of group A
β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis or pyoderma. The
latency between the streptococcal infection and the onset of
the clinical syndrome is 7–14 days in sore throat, while it is
2–4 weeks in pyoderma. In some cases, mild pharyngitis may
go unnoticed whereas preceding pyoderma can be detected
by healed scars.
The median age at presentation is between 6–8 years. The
rarity of APSGN in children younger than 2 years is attributed
to the low rate of streptococcal pharyngitis in this group and an
immature immune (antibody) response.
Three phases of the disease can be identified as the
latent, acute, and the recovery phases (Fig. 2). The recovery
phase occurs after resolution of fluid overload with diuresis,
normalization of blood pressure and resolution of proteinuria
and gross hematuria. Urine volume usually increases 4–7 days
after hospital admission, and this increase is rapidly followed
by resolution of edema and normalization of blood pressure.
Microscopic hematuria takes several months to resolve and
can persist for 1 year after the acute attack.
Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis can have
varying severity, mild cases may just present with microscopic
hematuria with mild proteinuria, while those at the other end
of the spectrum may have anuria and severe hypertension.
Edema is turgid, unlike in nephrotic syndrome where it is
flaccid and may increase to the entire body in unrestricted fluid
intake. Proteinuria is usually mild and not in the nephrotic
range. Massive proteinuria may be found in about 2–4% of
cases and its persistence is a risk factor for progression to
chronic renal disease.

Fig. 2: Summary of the typical clinical course of post-streptococcal
acute glomerulonephritis

Clinical Pearls
Indications for hospitalization
• Severe edema

• Hypertension

• Severe azotemia

• Respiratory distress

Clinical evaluation should include a detailed description
of hematuria which is an almost universal finding in APSGN.
Hematuria is typically described as “coke, “tea”, or “smoky”
colored in 25–60% of these children. Urine color is uniform
throughout the stream and the gross hematuria of AGN is
virtually always painless. It is also important to detect any
symptoms suggestive of complications especially dyspnea
due to fluid overload or headaches, visual disturbances, or
alteration in mental status due to hypertension. Any history
of rash, arthritis, hepatosplenomegaly, recent weight change,
or recent medication exposure should lead to search for
alternative causes.

Clinical Pearls
When to suspect rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis?
• Persistent oliguria
• Severe azotemia
• Nephrotic range proteinuria

Hypertension due to sodium and water retention and
consequent expansion of extracellular space occurs in up
to 80% of children with APSGN. Cerebral complications
of hypertension including headache, drowsiness, seizure,
mental status, and visual changes occur in 30–35% of the
children. Patients may present with clinical and radiologic
signs of pulmonary edema. Evidence for congestive heart
failure may be found in almost half of these children. Initially,

blood pressure is high, buthypotension occurs in later stages
when heart failure and shock supervenes. Other atypical
presentations of poststreptococcal GN have been listed in the
clinical pearl below.
Rapidly rising azotemia and persistent oliguria should
raise a suspicion of rapidly progressive GN.

Clinical Pearls
Atypical presentations of acute poststreptococcal
glomerulo­nephritis
• Subclinical disease
• Seizures
• Acute hypertensive crisis
• Acute pulmonary edema
• Acute kidney injury
• Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome
• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
• Rash similar to Henoch-Schönleinpurpura

INVESTIGATIONS
Urine examination shows acidic pH, dysmorphic red blood
cells, red cell casts, granular casts, and neutrophils suggestive of
glomerular inflammation. Mild to moderate (1‑2+) proteinuria
is commonly seen. Blood urea is increased in 60–65% of cases
and estimated creatinine clearance is decreased to less than
90 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 20%. The GFR is often decreased during
the acute phase of the disease. A mild degree of normocytic
normochromic anemia is also seen due to volume overload.
Hypoalbuminemia may be present in those with nephrotic
range proteinuria.
Serologic evidence of a recent streptococcal infection
should be sought in suspected cases of APSGN because
positive streptococcal serology is more sensitive (94.6%)
for diagnosis than history of recent infection (75.7%) or
positive cultures (24.3%). The most important serological
marker is antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer. ASO titers are
higher in pharyngitis-associated APSGN whereas cases
following pyoderma are more likely to demonstrate elevated
anti-deoxyribonuclease (DNase) B titer. Streptozyme test,
which includes four antigens (DNase B, streptolysin O,
hyaluronidase, and streptokinase) is reported to be positive
in 80% cases. Acute reduction in serum C3 level in APSGN
with a typical return to normal levels within 6 weeks of onset
is of foremost diagnostic importance. A minimal decrease in
C4 can occur transiently.

Light Microscopy
On light microscopy, there is diffuse hypercellularity
of endothelial and mesangial cells and infiltration of
the glomerular tuft with polymorphonuclear cells with
obliteration of the capillary lumina. GBM is normal and there
is little or no evidence of tubular or vascular injury (Fig. 3).
Rarely, patients with APSGN may have crescent formation
in over 50% of glomeruli, leading to the clinical picture of
rapidly progressive GN.

Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence pattern typically seen during the acute
phase of APSGN shows discrete granular deposits of IgG
and C3 in the capillary loops and mesangium (Figs 4 and 5).
Three patterns of the deposits are described in box 2. The
garland pattern is associated with heavy proteinuria and
worse long-term prognosis. Absence of immunofluorescence
(IF) deposits should prompt search for c-ANCA and p-ANCA
antibodies.

Renal Biopsy Findings
A renal biopsy is not indicated for diagnosis of APSGN but is
usually performed when atypical clinical manifestations are
present or the resolution is delayed. Conditions which require
a renal biopsy in the course of poststreptococcal GN are listed
in table 2.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

granular deposits giving a “starry sky” appearance

Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in majority
of the cases is a straightforward diagnosis. The differential
diagnosis includes several glomerulonephritides related to
chronic infection, infectious glomerulonephritides without an
immune-mediated etiology, and other primary and secondary
glomerular diseases. It should be differentiated from IgA
nephropathy (short latent period), membranoproliferative
GN (persistent hypocom­plementemia, unresolving nephritic
syndrome), lupus nephritis (persistent hypocomplementemia,
systemic manifestation), vasculitides (polyarteritis nodosa),
Henoch-Schonlein purpura (normal C3), hemolytic uremic
syndrome (hemolysis, thrombocytopenia), endocarditisassociated nephritis, and shunt nephritis.

478

Treatment of APSGN is largely supportive and should be
targeted toward the problem of hypertension and fluid
overload. Restriction of fluid and sodium intake with
adequate caloric intake is recommended. Hypertension
is managed with fluid restriction and administration of
loop diuretics (furosemide). Two or more antihypertensive
drugs may be needed including calcium-channel blockers.
Although captopril has been shown to reduce blood pressure
and improve GFR in APSGN patients, angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors should be used with caution due to
possible renal failure and hyperkalemia. Severe hypertension
may mandate the use of sodium nitroprusside infusion or
vasodilators (hydralazine).
Pulmonary edema is uncommon and should be treated
with oxygen and loop diuretics. Digitalis is not indicated,
because it is ineffective and may result in intoxication. Rarely,
overt heart failure and pulmonary edema may complicate
the clinical course. Occasionally, acute kidney injury, severe
fluid retention unresponsive to diuretics, pulmonary edema,
and intractable hyperkalemia necessitate hemodialysis
or continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Management
of hypertensive emergencies, acute kidney injury, acute
pulmonary edema, and severe hyperkalemia must be done as
per standard guidelines.
Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is pre­
vented by early antibiotic treatment, and the spread of
nephritis associated streptococcal infection is contained
by prophylactic antibiotic treatment to individuals at risk.
Early administration of penicillin is reported to prevent or
ameliorate the severity of AGN. Single dose of intramuscular
benzathine penicillin G or alternatively oral penicillin V for
10 days is recommended. Erythromycin or azithromycin are
used in patients allergic to penicillin.

CHAPTER 98: Acute Glomerulonephritis

Clinical Pearls
Antibiotic therapy in acute poststreptococcal glomerulo­
nephritis
• Children <27 kg: benzathine penicillin G single dose 600,000
units intramuscularly
• Children >27 kg: benzathinepenicillin G single dose 1.2 million
units intramuscularly
• Oral penicillin V 250 mg 2–3 times per day for 10 days
Allergic to penicillin
• Erythromycin 40 mg/kg/day for 10 days
• Azithromycin for 5 days.

PROGNOSIS
Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is typically
characterized by rapid resolution and an excellent prognosis.
Clinical improvement begins by 4–6 days with decrease in
edema and hypertension and increase in urine output. Gross
hematuria clears in first week, but microscopic hematuria may
persist for up to 6–12 months. Intermittent mild proteinuria may
persist, which is of no significance. Mortality is extremely rare
but may result due to severe hyperkalemia or pulmonary edema.
Recurrence of disease is rare since immunity to
streptococcal M protein is type-specific and long-lasting and
nephritogenic serotypes are limited. Long-term antibiotic
prophylaxis is thus not recommended. Certain histologic
findings may predict a poor prognosis. Garland pattern on IF
has been associated with heavy proteinuria and poor outcome.
Extracapillary crescent formation is the most ominous
histological finding in PSAGN. Patients with APSGN should
be followed up for several years for proteinuria and blood
pressure, and if there is persistent proteinuria or a decline in
renal functions, a renal biopsy is indicated.

Endocarditis Associated Renal Disease
Microscopic hematuria and proteinuria are indicative of renal
lesion in a child with infective endocarditis. Azotemia may
develop, but is mild except in cases that develop crescentic
GN. Serological findings include reduced C3 and C4. Antibiotic
treatment needs to be given for 4–6 weeks.

Shunt Nephritis
Infected ventriculoatrial shunts and rarely ventri­
culo­
peritoneal shunts may be complicated by development of
postinfectious GN. Common microorganisms causing shunt
infections are S. epidermidis in about 75% of cases and less
frequently S. aureus. Renal involvement is indicated by
proteinuria (nephrotic range), hematuria, and hypertension.
Laboratory findings include reduced C3 and C4 levels with
isolation of the organism from blood or shunt fluid cultures.
Renal biopsy mostly shows membranoproliferative GN.
Treatment of shunt nephritis includes intravenous antibiotics
and removal of infected shunt.

Henoch-schönlein Purpura and
Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy
Although clinically different, these two entities are histo­
logically identical. A typical case of Henoch-Schonlein purpura
presents with gross hematuria, edema, purpura, arthritis, and
abdominal pain. IgA nephropathy manifests with recurrent
gross hematuria. Renal histology varies from mild mesangial
proliferation to crescentic GN. Prominent IgA deposition in the
mesangium is characteristically seen.

Hepatitis B and
C Virus-related Glomerulonephritis
Renal involvement with hepatitis B is particularly common
in East Asian countries and South Africa. The lesions
seen commonly with this infection are membranous GN,
membranoproliferative GN, and occasionally vasculitis.
Hepatitis C virus infections are more commonly associated
with proliferative GN.

Approach to
Hematuria in Children
Mukta Mantan, Anand S Vasudev

INTRODUCTION
Hematuria is an uncommon condition in childhood. Yet it is
frightening to the parents and results in an almost immediate
referral to a pediatrician. An approach to this entity will be
discussed in this chapter. The incidence of gross hematuria
in children is estimated to be around 0.13%. Asymptomatic
microscopic hematuria is common in unselected populations
of children, with a prevalence that ranges from 0.4 to 4.1%.
However, on repeated evaluations, the prevalence of persistent
microscopic hematuria is about 0.5% based on the surveys of
school going children.

DEFINITION
Hematuria is defined as the presence of five or more red blood
cells (RBCs) per high-power field in multiple centrifuged urine
examinations (at least 3; 1 week apart). Children are referred for
presence of gross hematuria, persistent isolated microscopic
hematuria, and microscopic hematuria with clinical symptoms
or with proteinuria.

tract (extraglomerular). Cola-colored urine, presence of RBC
casts, and deformed (dysmorphic) RBCs suggest glomerular
bleeding. Phase contrast microscope or staining with special
stains (Wright stain) is required for detection of dysmorphic
RBCs (Fig. 2). Presence of more than 20% dysmorphic RBCs
suggests glomerular hematuria (Table 1). The causes of
hematuria are listed in table 2.
Box 1: Causes of red colored urine
• Food items
{{ Ingestion of beetroot, blackberries, food coloring agents
• Drugs
{{ Nitrofurantoin, phenophthalein, pyridium, rifampicin,
phenothiazines, sulfasalazine
• Metabolites
{{ Homogentisic acid, melanain, methemoglobin, porphyrins,
urates, tyrosinosis

GROSS HEMATURIA
Gross hematuria must be confirmed by microscopic
demonstration of RBC. If no RBCs are seen on microscopy, a
dipstick test is done to look for other causes of red colored urine.
If the dipstick is positive, it is indicative of hemoglobinuria
(usually caused by severe intravascular hemolysis) or
myoglobinuria from rhabdomyolysis (due to muscle trauma or
strenuous exercise). A negative dipstick test would point toward
the discoloration due to porphyria, drugs such as rifampicin,
pigments in foods, ingestion of beetroot and urates (Box 1).

Glomerular and Extraglomerular Hematuria

History and Physical Examination
Some clinical pointers in history and examinations may
indicate the cause for hematuria (Table 3).

Investigations
An episode of gross hematuria needs evaluation. After
confirming hematuria, algorithm 1 can be followed. If the
onset is acute and proteinuria is present, the likelihood of an
episode of postinfective glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is high.
The relevant investigations like anti-streptolysin (ASLO) titers,
complement C3 levels and kidney function tests (KFT) should
be done. An elevated ASLO (>200 IU/L), low C3 levels with
normal or deranged KFT are confirmative of poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis (PSGN). If the history is of prolonged
(3–4 weeks) duration, other causes like immunoglobulin A
(IgA) nephropathy, membranous or membranoproliferative
disease are more likely. Patients with IgA nephropathy are
likely to have recurrent episodes of gross hematuria, especially
with episodes of upper respiratory tract infections. Presence
of fever, joint pains, photosensitive rash points toward a
diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Most of these
conditions can be identified on a renal biopsy specimen which
should include light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and
electron microscopy (if available). Serological tests that help
in identification of the underlying cause are hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) and antihepatitis C virus (HCV) for related
nephropathy [membranous and membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (MPGN)]. Anti­
nuclear antibodies
(ANA) and anti-dsDNA for lupus nephritis; anti­neutrophilic
cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA and C-ANCA; both these
are immuno­
fluorescence based tests) for identification of
vasculitis (microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener’s and Churg
Strauss disease). Identification of ANCA can also be done by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based tests
(antimyeloperoxidase-anti-MPO corresponding to P-ANCA;
antiproteinase-3-antiPR3 corresponding to C-ANCA) which
are simpler and yield faster results.
Presence of extraglomerular hematuria points towards local
causes, polycystic kidneys, hydronephrosis, urolithiasis, and
hypercalciuria. Vascular abnormalities of urinary bladder can
also cause hematuria rarely. An ultrasound kidney, ureter,

bladder (KUB) would identify any structural abnormalities and/
or, stones in kidney. Ureteric stones are usually not identified
with ultrasound and require a radiograph of KUB region. If
calculi are identified, a complete urinary biochemistry needs
to be done (24-h urinary excretion of calcium, oxalates and
urates). If there is a difficulty in collecting 24 hours sample spot,
urine sample can be used for determining urinary calcium/
creatinine ratio and oxalate/creatinine ratio. Hypercalciuria
is defined as urine calcium to creatinine ratio greater than 0.2
(under 6 months of age: >0.8; 6–12 months: >0.6) or a 24-hour
calcium excretion exceeding 4 mg/kg/day. Referral to a pediatric
surgeon/urologist will be required when clinical evaluation
and work up indicates a structural urogenital abnormality, an
obstructing calculus or a tumor. The most common malignant
renal tumor in childhood is Wilm’s tumor and is associated with
a palpable abdominal mass and hematuria in most patients.
Other primary urinary tract tumors, e.g., hemangiomas,
rhabdomyosarcomas, lymphomas resulting in hematuria
are rare. Cystoscopy to identify the source of bleeding is best
performed during active bleeding.

evaluation is given in algorithm 2. If the hematuria is associated
with proteinuria, chronic glomerulonephritis is the chief
suspect, hence investigations as suggested for gross hematuria
should be performed (C3, ANA, ANCA, renal biopsy). Other
causes of asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria are
benign familial hematuria, IgA nephropathy, MPGN, Alport
syndrome. If the hematuria is nonglomerular, investigations
should be done to identify hypercalciuria and urolithiasis.
Invasive investigations, like cystoscopy and angiography,
would be required if no cause is found on other investigations.

Clinical Pearl
• Neither visual description nor the dipstick alone is sufficient to
diagnose gross hematuria; urine microscopy is required.

Isolated microscopic hematuria is benign on most occasions.
However, it needs to be evaluated if it is symptomatic, i.e.,
associated with edema, hypertension, rash, fever, joint pains or

than 1–2 years duration) needs an evaluation. The approach for

CHAPTER 99: Approach to Hematuria in Children

Indications for Renal Biopsy
Glomerular hematuria persisting for more than 4 weeks and
without features of PSGN merits a renal biopsy. Also, decreased
complement levels beyond 3 months indicate a need for
renal biopsy to rule out other causes like IgA nephropathy,
membranous or MPGN nephropathy. Patients with deranged
renal functions (urea and creatinine) and/or presence of
proteinuria also need a renal biopsy to detect the presence
of chronic glomerulonephritis. Patients with rapid worsening
of renal functions presenting like RPGN should have an early
biopsy to detect crescentic glomerulonephritis. Presence of
ANA, HBsAg, anti-HCV or ANCA positivity is also an indication
for renal biopsy.

MANAGEMENT
The definitive management of hematuria is based on the
underlying etiology. Briefly the management of the two most
common causes of hematuria, i.e., postinfective glomerulo­
nephritis and idiopathic hypercalciuria are discussed below.

Postinfective Glomerulonephritis
The investigations useful in confirming the diagnosis are a
urinalysis, complete blood count, antistreptolysin O (ASLO)
titers, blood urea, serum creatinine, complement C3 levels.
Most patients with PSGN would have elevated ASLO titers
(>200 IU/L); low complement levels (<60 mg/dL) and mildly
deranged KFT. Urinalysis always shows glomerular hematuria,
presence of RBC casts, and leukocyturia. Proteinuria is usually
less than 2+. If these tests are negative and there is resolution
of symptoms, a presumptive diagnosis of postinfectious
glomerulonephritis can be made. Most patients with an acute
PIGN would resolve of their hematuria and edema within
10–14 days. The kidney functions also normalize by this time.
Persistence of gross hematuria or proteinuria beyond 4 weeks
is unusual and often becomes an indication for kidney biopsy
in these patients. Hypertension and fluid overload can be
managed by use of diuretics like furosemide in doses of 2–4 mg/
kg/day in two or three divided doses. If hypertension persists,
it can be controlled with calcium channel blockers or use of
b-blockers. Amlodipine in doses of 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day; atenolol
in doses of 0.5–2 mg/kg/day are often sufficient in controlling
elevated blood pressure. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers postinfective
glomerulonephritis is not recommended as most patients
with acute glomerulonephritis have a transient reduction
in their glomerular filtration rate. The duration for use of
diuretics and antihypertensives is usually less than 2 weeks.
Patients with severe fluid overload and acute renal failure may
require renal replacement therapy in the form of peritoneal or
hemodialysis. This occurs in less than 10% patients of acute
glomerulonephritis.
Patients having persistence of gross hematuria or heavy
proteinuria beyond 4 weeks duration need a renal biopsy
to determine the underlying cause. Presence of rapidly
progressive renal failure is an urgent indication for biopsy.

Persistence of hypocomplementenemia (beyond 12 weeks) or
absence of is another indication.

Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy
The condition is typically associated with gross hematuria but
at times, may present with microscopic hematuria.
The diagnosis of IgA nephropathy is confirmed on renal
biopsy that shows predominantly immunoglobulin IgA
deposits in the mesangium on immunofluorescence. While
ACE inhibitors are given to all patients with IgA nephropathy,
immunosuppressants like steroids, azathioprine, or
mycophenolate mofetil may be required in patients having
nephrotic range proteinuria.

Alport Syndrome
Alport syndrome should be suspected in patients (especially
males) with persistent glomerular microscopic hematuria
once structural abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract
have been ruled out. A positive family history of hematuria
or renal failure may be a pointer towards the diagnosis. Light
microscopy may show variable thickening of the glomerular
basement membrane. Initially the changes are thinning of the
membrane that later change to basket weaving and lamellation
of the glomerular basement membrane. These changes are
most marked on electron microscopy and may not be well
marked in pediatric patients as compared to adults. Early
treatment with ACE inhibitors has been shown to slow down
the progression to end stage renal disease in children.

Idiopathic Hypercalciuria
It is found to be a common cause of gross as well as micro­scopic
hematuria. A family history of renal calculi may be present. A
spot urinary calcium to creatinine ratio of more than 0.2 or a
24-hour urinary calcium excretion of over 4 mg/kg is abnormal.
The condition is managed with a high fluid intake, low salt and
protein intake, and use of hydrochlorthiazide. This will reduce
urinary calcium excretion, stop hematuria, and prevent stone
formation. Do not restrict dietary calcium intake.

Benign Familial Hematuria
It is characterized by persistent, isolated microscopic hematuria.
Other family members may also have microscopic hematuria.
Glomerular capillary basement membrane thinning is seen on
electron microscopy. Though the condition is usually benign
but these children need a long-term follow-up.

CONCLUSION
Hematuria is an uncommon condition in childhood. An
episode of gross hematuria and symptomatic microscopic
hematuria should always be evaluated. Asymptomatic
microscopic hematuria needs evaluation only if it persists on
repeated microscopic examination of urine (beyond 1 year).
An effort should be made to identify the underlying cause
of hematuria. Treatment of the cause results in resolution of
hematuria on most occasions.

Clinical Pearls
Hematuria and proteinuria
• The presence of both hematuria and proteinuria is sinister
• Renal biopsy should be considered whenever glomerular or
tubulointerstitial lesions are suspected.
What to tell the parents?
• For children with only microscopic hematuria, reassurance is
sufficient. They should, however, be instructed to notify as and
when gross hematuria occurs. These children should have an
annual urine examination to detect any proteinuria, a much
more sinister marker of glomerular disease.

Approach to
Urinary Tract Infection
Pankaj V Deshpande

INTRODUCTION
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children generate the
strongest emotions across the pediatric field! It has evoked a
lot of fear in parents as well as health carers to the extent that
each episode is viewed as a disaster for the kidneys! There has
been literature ad nauseum about UTIs in children and if you
consider this to be another of those articles, (I wouldn’t blame
you!) I am hoping that you will be slightly wrong as I take you
along to look at the practical aspect of approaching a child with
UTI and look at it with the same care as with other illnesses
rather than dread!
In the first year of life, both boys and girls have the same rate
of developing a UTI (certainly in the first 6 months). Thereafter,
the incidence in girls is higher than boys.

DEFINITION
Urinary tract infection in children is based on the presence of a
positive urine culture in a symptomatic child. There are several
parts to this statement. Firstly, the child has to be symptomatic,
either in the form of urinary symptoms or have a fever without
an identifiable source. Secondly, urine culture being positive
would vary according to the method of collection of urine
(clean catch, catheter, suprapubic, etc.).
As you will realize, the common test used for diagnosing
UTI is not included in the pure definition of UTI. Pyuria
(presence of leukocytes in the urine) is only an indicator of
inflammation and not always the sign of UTI in children.

CLINICAL FEATURES: (WHEN TO SUSPECT)
The first major task is to be aware of UTIs in children but also
that only appropriate tests done at the appropriate times will
help you in diagnosing but not over or underdiagnosing UTIs!
Unfortunately, both are common!
In infants and children up to 2 years of age, the symptoms
may be subtle. Fever without a focus is an important feature

ch-100.indd 485

to be aware of! Let us be clear that this means that on clinical
examination, you cannot identify a source of the fever. All of
us are pretty good clinicians and hence, let us use our clinical
skills well! There is no point in sending tests in a child with
fever and a severe cough or cold! You have identified a cause of
fever and doing tests at this stage will only serve to confuse you!
Apart from this, if the infant is obviously crying persistently
(not an occasional episode in 2 days) while voiding, has
turbid/discolored urine or has a poor stream of urine (in
a boy), UTI should be thought of. Persistent jaundice in a
neonate beyond 2 weeks of age is an examination question
more than a practical reality!
In older children, the symptoms are more likely to be
related to the urinary tract as they will be able to communicate
their ailment better. Presence of frequency of voiding, dysuria
(pain while voiding), urgency with daytime wetting may be
seen more commonly here. They may also have fever, loin
pain, vomiting and in some cases, may actually have diarrhea
as the presenting symptom. Fever without focus should also
prompt a thought about UTI though it will be less common
than in infants.

Clinical Pearl
Urine test for urinary tract infection should be done only in
symptomatic children
• Fever without focus
• Urinary symptoms, especially in older child.

DIAGNOSIS
This aspect of UTIs always raises a hornet’s nest and strong
emotions! I am not going to quote all literature about this
aspect but let us get our basic concepts right before embarking
on other thought provoking aspects of diagnosis (Algorithm 1).
As explained above, once a UTI is suspected, urine tests will
be required to diagnose or rule out a UTI. Those who have sat

patiently beside their child (boy or girl) waiting for him/her to
pee (void) will realize the eureka moment when the child pees
(voids)! The two tests that are used commonly are a routine
examination of urine with microscopy and a urine culture.
Unfortunately, there is no advice given to the parents in
most places which causes a lot of heartburn amongst doctors
regarding results as they cause a lot of confusion! Sample
collection is crucial to the diagnosis of UTI.

ch-100.indd 486

For a clean catch/mid-stream urine sample, the genital
area is cleaned with normal soap and water and dried. In an
older child, a mid stream sample can be attempted but in an
infant, a clean catch sample is good enough. This implies that
the urine is collected straight into the container and not on a
plastic sheet, ”dabba” or cotton! Once collected it needs to be
transported to the microbiology lab immediately and plated
within 30–60 minutes. If a delay is anticipated, the sample

11/24/2016 2:22:16 PM

Chapter 100: Approach to Urinary Tract Infection
should be stored in the refrigerator at 4°C (to a maximum of
24 h). This implies that the urine sample will not be left on the
table for 2 hours before being given in the lab. This is because it
will allow the growth of contaminant organisms.
If the urine is collected appropriately as described above, a
pure growth of more than 100,000 organisms/mL is considered
as significant and positive. Recent literature would even suggest
that a count of 50,000 may also be significant. However, lower
counts are more likely to represent contamination and efforts
should be made to collect the urine appropriately, unless the
child is completely asymptomatic.

Clinical Pearl
• Advice regarding collection of urine (cleaning, clean catch, and
appropriate transport).

If the urine is collected by using a urinary catheter, the
cleaning should be adhered to and strict asepsis maintained
or you may be the cause of the child’s subsequent UTI! If this
is done, a colony count of more than 10,000 organisms/mL will
be considered significant and positive.
Suprapubic aspiration of urine (using a syringe and
needle to aspirate urine directly from the bladder) is possible
in young children as the bladder is an abdominal organ till
5 years of age. In this case, the trick lies in knowing when to
do the aspiration. If one waits till about half to one hour after
the last void, the chances of obtaining urine increase. In this
case, any growth of organisms is considered significant and
implies a UTI.
It is important to note that bag urine samples have a
high contamination rate and are not recommended for urine
collection in children. In any case, bag urine is often collected
in an inappropriate manner (as the child needs to be upright
before collection and the bag removed soon after voiding) and
hence, should not be used in children.

Clinical Pearl
• Method of urine collection important to determine significant
colony count. Bag urine not recommended.

Microscopy of the urine may reveal the presence of
leukocytes. There is ample literature about what constitutes
significant pyuria, but it is very important to note that
leukocytes may be present in the urine for varied other reasons
and do not always imply a UTI. They may be seen in any
fever, dehydration, hypercalciuria, urolithiasis, inflammatory
conditions like interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis and
in fact, in any inflammatory condition in the body (even a
severe respiratory infection). For the purpose of diagnosing
UTI, presence of more than 5 leukocytes/hpf in fresh
centrifuged sample or more than 10 leukocytes/mm3 in an
uncentrifuged sample is considered significant. Presence
of a positive urine culture in the absence of leukocytes in
the urine, especially in an older child, should be a cue for
a thoughtful consideration about whether it is really a UTI.

ch-100.indd 487

Though, leukocyturia is considered to have less than an ideal
role in predicting UTI, we should realize that more than only
a positive urine culture may not indicate a UTI. Here, the
symptoms of a child play an important role. Positive cultures
may be due to many reasons, the chief being improper
collection and contamination and no test is 100% accurate!

Clinical Pearl
• Presence of significant number of leukocytes in urine can be
due to many reasons, urinary tract infection (UTI) being one of
them. Unless associated with symptoms and a positive urine
culture, it does not represent a UTI.

Urine dipstick can be used as a better way to screen for
UTI. Presence of leukocytes is detected by the presence of
leukocyte esterase and the conversion of nitrate to nitrite
is detected by the nitrite test. When both are positive, the
predictive value for a UTI is very high (UTI very likely).
It should be remembered that false positives for both
leukocytes and nitrites can occur (especially in exposed
sticks, medications, etc.).
Dipslide has been used to plate the urine immediately after
it is collected with good results.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
I think it is extremely important to realize that every ”positive”
urine test is not a UTI. As explained above, urine routine
showing ”significant” number of leukocytes when the child is
asymptomatic, carries no meaning in the general population
of children! Similarly, one of the biggest problems with a
positive urine culture is contamination as the collection is
not ideal in children and several authors have addressed
this issue suggesting that a fair number of children/adults
receive antibiotic therapy when they do not have a UTI. The
most important message is that in the absence of symptoms
suggesting UTIs, urine tests are not required and do not
indicate a UTI!
Similarly, there are several conditions in children that
mimic a UTI and unfortunately all these children keep on
receiving antibiotics for suspected UTIs. I will mention a couple
of them. One of the common causes of dysuria, frequency, and
urgency in girls is vulval erythema. Remember, this is not a
bacterial or fungal infection. They will present with exactly the
same symptoms as a UTI and unless local examination is done
properly, they will all have urine tests done. Often the urine
tests are abnormal as they reflect local inflammation rather
than a UTI and they get treated with antibiotics and have many
unnecessary tests done! It is an extremely common condition
in outpatient department (OPD) practice, more so in the
tropical countries and the common causes of worsening this
condition are repeated washing of the genital area and use of
antifungal creams. These children do not have a UTI and do not
need antibiotics. A similar condition would be vulvovaginitis
secondary to an infective etiology.
Another condition that gets treated with multiple courses of
antibiotics is detrusor instability in children that presents with

487

11/24/2016 2:22:16 PM

Section 12: Nephrology
frequency, urgency, and dysuria. They also will have daytime
wetting, the information usually not being volunteered. Again,
stimulant drinks worsen this condition and no amount of
antibiotic therapy will alleviate the symptoms.
Another ”mimic” of a different category is a positive
tests for urine routine and/or urine culture when the child
is asymptomatic. Assuming the urine is collected in an ideal
manner, this indicates asymptomatic bacteruria and needs no
treatment!
When interpreting a urine test, all the above factors need to
be borne in mind.

Clinical Pearl
• Remember urinary tract infection mimics like vulval redness,
detrusor instability, and asymptomatic bacteruria.

COMMON ORGANISMS
Briefly, gram-negative organisms usually cause UTIs.
They include E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and in some cases,
Pseudomonas. Enterococci may be seen in infants and
some older children. UTIs due to gram-positive cocci,
like Staphylococcus, should raise suspicion of obstructive
pathology in the urinary tract. Atypical infections with fungilike Candida are also seen especially in children exposed to
many antibiotics.

TREATMENT
Once a suspicion of UTI has been confirmed on the urine
tests, an antibiotic course has to be started. Remember, urine
culture reports become available after 24–48 hours and hence,
antibiotics have to be started based on local practice. The table
below suggests the antibiotics that can be used (Algorithm 1).
A single antibiotic is adequate to clear a UTI. Table 1
provides the options available . Following are the indications for
parenteral antibiotics, options of which are described in table 2:
• Inability to tolerate oral antibiotics
• Persistent vomiting

Sick looking/“toxic” child
Very young infants (less than 3 months of age) with high
grade fever.
In case of an “office” UTI (OPD treatment), antibiotic
course of 7–10 days is sufficient. In children needing parenteral
antibiotics, a total duration of 14 days would be required.
However, once the fever and symptoms settle in 48–72 hours,
the antibiotic can be changed to an appropriate oral antibiotic.
There is no need to repeat the urine culture after the
treatment is complete. Urine culture may need to be done
again only if there is no symptomatic improvement suggesting
that UTI persists.
One of the common queries that crop up is regarding the
antibiotic sensitivity pattern. It usually becomes available after
about 48–72 hours of starting therapy. Unless the child has not
responded in terms of symptoms, there is usually no need to
change antibiotics. In vitro and in vivo sensitivities are quite
different and an antibiotic that is perceived as resistant often
works well in eliminating a UTI.

Other/Nonpharmacologic Therapy
Often the most forgotten part! One needs to make an effort to try
and decipher the reason for developing the UTI. This not mean
jumping to radiological investigations, but talking to the child
and parents! Local factors, especially bladder bowel dysfunction
is a major risk factor for UTI. Addressing constipation, voiding
regularly, ensuring an adequate fluid intake, and keeping the
postvoid residue to a minimum are some factors that go a long
way in preventing UTIs. Using a cotton underwear and clean
hygienic practice should also be advised.

Clinical Pearl
• Do not forget to talk to the child/parent regarding constipation,
regular voiding, and adequate fluid intake.

FOLLOW UP AND SUBSEQUENT CARE
Once the antibiotic course is completed, one of the dilemmas
is about prophylaxis, especially in view of recent literature.
The recommendation here is that prophylaxis is advocated for
all infants who have a UTI till all radiological investigations
are complete or till 1 year of age. For older children, the role
of prophylaxis looks less clear and if used, should be till all
investigations are complete or factors that are believed to be a
risk factor for recurrent UTIs are addressed (e.g., constipation).
There certainly seems no role for long-term prophylaxis for
years together. The commonly used prophylactic agents are:
• Co-trimoxazole (to give trimethoprim in the dose of
1–2 mg/kg) once a day
• Nitrofurantoin 1 mg/kg once a day
• Cephalexin 15 mg/kg once a day.
The ideal prophylactic agent should not change the normal
periurethral flora. Hence, co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin
are better agents than cephalexin. There is no need to rotate
prophylactic agents. If the urine culture shows resistance to the
preventive agent, there is usually no need to change the agent
after the treatment of the UTI.

11/24/2016 2:22:16 PM

Chapter 100: Approach to Urinary Tract Infection
There is no role for checking urine regularly (once a week/
fortnight/month) for reasons made very clear above. If the
child has symptoms, he/she should have urine tests done.

Clinical Pearl
• Regular urine test to detect urinary tract infections has no role.
Do urine test only in symptomatic children as explained.

Radiological Investigations
There are recommended guidelines about the investigations
required after a child develops a UTI. They are listed in Table 3.
These are the minimum investigations suggested for the
particular age group. Additional investigations are recom­
mended in the presence of recurrent UTIs, pyelonephritis or
abnormal investigations like an ultrasound scan.
Unfortunately, the recommended tests get done at the
wrong time and are liable to wrong interpretation.
An ultrasound scan of the kidneys and bladder should be
done as soon as possible in a child with UTI. For an inpatient,
it should be when the child is admitted and for an outpatient, it
should be soon and certainly within a week. Please be careful
about interpreting the evidence of cystitis on the ultrasound
scan as a mildly thickened bladder wall. Unless the bladder
is full, thickness cannot be interpreted with accuracy and
will look ”thickened”! One needs to look at the scan and not
the report.
The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is useful in
showing up nonfunctioning areas of the kidneys. Acute changes
secondary to a UTI can last for as long as 4–6 months. The DMSA
scan is used to determine changes that may need to long-term
monitoring. Hence, it is pointless to do a DMSA scan soon after a
UTI. Please remember that a DMSA scan should be done at least
4–6 months after an episode of UTI (the later, the better).
One should also realize that all changes seen on a DMSA
scan do not indicate scarring secondary to a UTI (though the
report may say so!). One presumes that the DMSA scan would
have shown normal kidneys before the episode of UTI to be able
to confidently report scarring. That is a very big presumption.
There are many children who are born with abnormal kidneys/
imperfect embryogenesis/dysplasia and changes seen on a
DMSA scan are similar to those reported as scarring. Note
that the ultrasound scan may actually show normal kidneys
in these children. Hence, abnormalities on a DMSA scan have
to be interpreted with caution. Clinical interpretation is more
important rather than what is printed on the report (e.g., a single
UTI is unlikely to cause a small kidney with very poor function).

Clinical Pearls
• Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan for detecting long-term
changes should be done at least 4–6 months after a urinary
tract infection (UTI)
• Ultrasound scan soon after a UTI
• Micturating cystourethrogram, if required, after the UTI is
adequately treated.

Finally, an micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) is not
indicated in all children with UTIs. Far too many MCUGs are
done for weak indications. In children less than 1 year of age
with a UTI or when bladder outlet obstruction is suspected,
it is definitely indicated. Symptoms suggesting bladder outlet
obstruction are as follows:
• Poor urine stream
• Dribbling of urine
• Abdominal swelling (bladder)
• Voiding by pressing the abdomen
• Bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter on ultrasound
scan
• Large thick walled trabeculated bladder on ultrasound
• Antenatal scans with bilateral hydronephrosis/hydro­ureter
or large bladder.
Please remember to give antibiotics to the child when the
MCUG is being done. A 7-day course of antibiotics (2 days
before and 5 days after MCUG) is a fair practice. One could also
use intravenous antibiotics before MCUG or follow any other
local practice guideline for the purpose. I have seen several
children who have developed a UTI after an MCUG when
antibiotics have not been used and that is not acceptable.
It would be impossible to start commenting on actions
required for various abnormalities seen on various scans as
that would take up too much space. It should be remembered
that an intravenous pyelogram is an extremely poor test for
renal scarring and is not recommended.

CONCLUSION
Last but not the least, do not forget to check the renal function
of the child. As explained above, the only way to detect children
with abnormal DMSA scans (abnormality existing before
the UTI) is looking at the renal parameters. Ensure a serum
creatinine is done at least 2 weeks after the episode of UTI and
interpret appropriately to calculate the estimated glomerular
filtration rate. Also ensure a urine protein/creatinine ratio is
done to look for proteinuria at the same time.
Urinary tract infection is a fairly common condition in
children and instead of alarming everyone including ourselves,
let us analyze the situation correctly and take appropriate steps
so that management of a child with UTI is kept simple. Let us
also realize that recent literature is suggesting that long-term
outcome for the kidneys is good in the face of an occasional
UTI also! So it’s not all doom and gloom!

Antenatal Renal Anomalies:
Outcome and Postnatal Management
Mehul A Shah

INTRODUCTION
Antenatal ultrasonographic-detected renal anomalies were
first reported by Garrett et al. in 1970. Since then, with routine
screening during pregnancy and availability of sophisticated
equipment, the incidence of antenatal renal anomalies has
increased. Initial reports showed 1% incidence of major
structural fetal anomaly with approximately 50% of those 1%
affecting central nervous system (CNS), 30% genitourinary,
15% gastrointestinal (GI), and 5% cardiopulmonary systems.
Data from the past decade and half indicate a higher incidence
of renal anomalies, especially fetal hydronephrosis (HN) in up
to 4.5% of pregnant women.
It is well recognized that delay in the maturation of renal
system can lead to transient dilatation of the urinary tract. Also,
the fetal upper urinary tract dilatation can be a dynamic process
related to the effect of bladder (full bladder can cause backpressure changes on upper tract). The early diagnosis of renal
anomalies allows the obstetrician to plan delivery, especially in
those women with associated oligohydramnios, early neonatal
management, and prevention of long-term complications
such as recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), hypertension,
and renal failure. On the other side, the disadvantages of early
detection of renal anomalies include over work up and also
excessive parental anxiety since approximately 70% of these
anomalies are benign and known to resolve spontaneously.
Two risks should be avoided when managing antenatal
detected renal anomalies: (1) delayed therapy and (2)
excessive treatment. Hence, knowledge about the correlation
of fetal renal ultrasonography (USG) abnormalities and
the final outcome is important for proper counseling. The
challenge, within the babies with antenatal detected renal
anomalies, is to identify the small (<25%) number of babies
who have significant renal disease requiring later surgery or
long-term follow up of renal function without subjecting the
majority (~75% of those detected antenatally) to unnecessary
investigations and antibiotics. Certainly, baby boys with
posterior urethral valves (PUVs), and other babies with pelvi-

ch-101.indd 491

ureteric junction obstruction (PUJO), vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR), vesicoureteric junction obstruction (VUJO), and
multicystic dysplastic kidneys needs further evaluation in the
neonatal period.

Clinical Pearl
• Most antenatal renal anomalies are BENIGN and only ~25% have
significant nephrouropathy that require further evaluation.

NORMAL FETAL URINARY TRACT
The fetal kidneys can be identified in utero by the 15th gestational
week, but visualization of internal renal architectures is usually
not possible until after the 20th week. The pelvicalyceal system
and capsule are highly echogenic while the medulla is almost
anechoic. The urine-filled pelvis may appear prominent
without obstruction. The fetal bladder can also be identified
in the early second trimester. Hourly fetal urine production
increases from 12 mL/h at 32 weeks to 26 mL/h at term. The
ureters are not imaged sonographically unless they are dilated.
The amniotic fluid volume reflects renal function and
patency of the genitourinary tract. The total volume of amniotic
fluid, which ranges from 500 to 2,000 mL, is also an important
factor in a fetus with HN. In early gestation, the source of
amniotic fluid is a transudate of maternal plasma. By 20 weeks,
most amniotic fluid is fetal urine. The volume increases until
the end of the second trimester at a relative constant rate, then
it remains steady, and then decreases shortly before term. The
normal amniotic fluid index (AFI) is between 8 and 20 cm.
Decreased amniotic fluid volume, called oligohydramnios
(<8 cm), often indicates decreased fetal kidney function
(dysplasia). The other cause of oligohydramnios is placental
insufficiency. On the contrary, polyhydramnios (AFI >20 cm)
is often associated with renal tubulopathy (such as Bartter’s
syndrome) indicating fetal polyuria, GI tract obstruction, CNS
malformation, and maternal diabetes mellitus.

Renal malformations detected antenatally, now referred to as
congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract can be
broadly classified into three groups:
1. Upper tract dilatation, without bladder abnormalities
(most common), and includes ureteric dilatation [antenatal
hydronephrosis (AH)]
2. Cystic kidney diseases (including multicystic dysplastic
kidneys, polycystic kidney disease, and cystic dysplasia)
3. Bladder outlet obstruction (posterior urethral valves).

Grading System for Hydronephrosis
There are different grading systems in the literature to assess
severity of HN (Table 1). Some are based on qualitative
change in the pelvicalyceal system that are subjective and not
reproducible (such as Society for Fetal Urology system) and
some are based on quantitative changes (such as Blachar’s
grading system for HN). Blachar’s grading system is based
on anteroposterior renal pelvis diameter (APRPD), and is a
quantitative system, thus more likely to be reproducible.

Clinical Pearl
• Anteroposterior diameter of renal pelvis is the preferred
method for assessing severity of hydronephrosis and should
be insisted in the report.

ANTENATAL HYDRONEPHROSIS
As with the grading system for postnatal HN, there is no
uniformly accepted definition of AH. In general, most authors
would define AH when the APRPD is greater than 5 mm at
20 weeks of gestation and greater than 7 mm at 34 weeks. The
APRPD greater than or equal to gestational age in months is
considered significant (for e.g., at 6 months, 6 mm or greater
dilatation of pelvis is significant). Of importance to note is that
presence of calyceal dilatation or hydroureter at any stage is
significant. Prenatal USG examination is important not only in
mid pregnancy (~20–22 weeks) but also in the third trimester to
detect upper tract anomalies that can be missed in early scans.
In the study by Bernanrdica Valent-Moric et al., almost 47% of
AH was detected between 30 and 38 weeks of gestation. Hence,
a third trimester USG between 30 and 38 weeks’ gestation is
necessary in addition to targeted imaging for fetal anomalies
scan at 20 weeks to detect renal anomalies.

492

ch-101.indd 492

Clinical Pearl
• Third trimester scan is necessary to detect at least 40% of renal
anomalies.

Antenatal Hydronephrosis: Postnatal Outcome
Based on several published reports, the following obser­vations
can be made:
• ~70% with AH are transient or isolated or benign (resolve
spontaneously)
• 10–15% have VUR
• 8–10% have PUJO
• 5–10% have other urinary tract anomalies (PUV, VUJO,
duplex, etc.)

Antenatal Renal Anomalies: When to Worry?
(only ~ 5–10% of all antenatal renal anomalies)
• Oligohydramnios (indicates renal dysplasia/decreased
renal function)
• Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis (boys/girls)–PUV, high
grade VUR
• Bilateral severe HN (boys–PUVs, although not always)
• Bilateral enlarged and echogenic kidneys (ARPKD)
• Other organ anomalies (CNS, syndromic).

Clinical Pearl
• Only ~5–10% of all antenatal renal anomalies cause major
problems.

Postnatal Evaluation
The goal of evaluation is to identify all infants with significant
nephrouropathy (~25% of all antenatal renal anomalies)
without subjecting the majority (~75%) to unnecessary
radiological investigations and thereby, minimizing parental
anxiety, costs, and radiation exposure.
The possibility of significant nephrouropathy increases
with the severity of HN, persistence of HN into the third
trimester, and bilateral involvement. Certainly, presence of
oligohydramnios (AF <8 cm) and bilateral severe HN indicates
high possibility of PUV in a male baby.
According to the study by Bernardica Valent-Moric, the
incidence of significant nephrouropathy was 95% (19 of 20) in
infants with severe HN, 53% (23 of 43) in infants with moderate
HN, and 29% (23 of 82) in infants with mild HN.
The management of infants with AH is based upon two
factors: severity of HN and presence of unilateral or bilateral
HN. With severe or bilateral HN, the first postnatal USG is done
within 2 days of birth, and in others, the first USG is postponed
until 7–10 days of life when diuresis is established.
Table 2 shows the timing of various radiological imaging
in relation to severity of HN. There is practically no role of

Section 12: Nephrology
If HN is persisting on the second USG, then a micturating
cystourethrogram (MCUG) is performed to rule out VUR.
Infants with normal MCUG and increasing HN will require
diethylene triamine pentaacitic acid (DTPA) or ethylcysteine
(EC) renal scan at 3–6 months to rule out PUJO. If the HN is
stable or improving, a DTPA renal scan may not be necessary.
If the suspicion of PUV is high (poor urinary stream,
palpable bladder, oligohydramnios), USG and MCUG should
be performed before baby is discharged from nursery.
The majority of cases with mild or moderate HN appear to
resolve by 18 months of age, In one study of 282 infants with
mild-to-moderate HN, majority resolved by 18 months age (i.e.,
APRPD less than 5 mm on two consecutive USG) and only 6%
had significant nephrouropathy (14 had PUJO and 4 had VUR).

Unilateral severe hydronephrosis
Here, USG is performed in first week of life followed by another
at 1–2 months age. Since the possibility of PUJO is higher, DTPA
or EC renal scan is next performed at 2–3 months of age. If the
DTPA scan is negative for obstruction, then a MCUG is done to
rule out VUR.

Severe hydronephrosis
(bilateral or solitary kidney)
Infants with severe bilateral AH and/or bladder distension
should have serial renal function tests done in first few days of
life. USG and MCUG [under intravenous (IV) cefotaxime cover]
are performed in first 2 days of life to exclude PUV in boys and
VUR in boys and girls. If there is no evidence of bladder outlet
obstruction (PUV or neurogenic bladder), then a DTPA or EC
renal scan is performed between 2 and 3 months of age to rule
out PUJO or VUJO.
Obtaining DTPA renal scan in first month of life does not
provide accurate results due to renal function immaturity
[i.e., low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) physiologically and
DTPA molecule is excreted mainly by glomerular filtration].
Hence, a dynamic scan is delayed until 2–3 months age
when the GFR is roughly 50–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [except
mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renal scan that can be
performed in first month since MAG3 is excreted mainly by
tubular secretion and this function matures faster than the
GFR in newborns].

ROLE OF PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS

494

Based on the low risk of UTI in most babies with PUJO and
isolated HN as well as the current evidence suggesting an
early diagnosis followed by prompt treatment of febrile UTI in
children with VUR, most babies do not need chemoprophylaxis.
This is also suggested from our observation of only 4 out of 115
babies with antenatal renal anomalies developing febrile UTI
(2 had PUV, 1 VUJO, and 1 had isolated HN).
In babies with documented VUR or PUV or those with
severe HN pending further imaging (MCUG and DTPA renal
scan), cephalexin should be used for UTI prophylaxis at 5 mg/
kg/dose two times a day.

ch-101.indd 494

Clinical Pearl
• If renal ultrasonography (USG) is performed on day 1–3 of
life, repeat renal USG is mandatory between 2 and 4 weeks of
age (since in first few days, because of physiological oliguria,
hydronephrosis may not be evident)

ISOLATED ANTENATAL HYDRONEPHROSIS
It is defined as isolated renal pelvic dilatation without
associated urinary tract abnormalities (i.e., absence of calyceal
dilatation, cortical thinning, hydroureter, VUR, PUJO, and
bladder anomalies) i.e., these infants have a normal MCUG
and a normal DTPA renal scan.
In a paper published by Sidhu et al. from the Hospital for
Sick Children, Canada, following observations were made:
• APRPD <12 mm, Society of Fetal Ultrasound grade 1–2:
benign condition, most improve (95%)
• Presence of cortical thinning: marker of deterioration
• Severe grades: variable rates of stabilization (60%).
The authors concluded that there is sufficient evidence
to suggest that mild HN (APRPD <12 mm) is a self-limited
condition and that clarification is required for moderate-tosevere HN.
Rarely, HN may worsen after initial improvement (<2%).
As a result, if there is persistent dilation at 3 months of age (in
absence of VUR or PUJO), we suggest to monitor the degree
of HN with an ultrasound performed at 1 and 2 years of age,
and if needed, between 3 and 5 years of age. Most often the
resolution of mild-to-moderate HN occurs by 18 months of age
in majority of patients.

Vesicoureteral REFLUX
After isolated (benign) HN, VUR is the next common urinary
tract abnormality detected though antenatal screening in
approximately 10–15% babies.
Vesicoureteral reflux is associated with long-term
complications related to recurrent UTIs as well as dysplasia
associated with high-grade reflux. These complications
include hypertension, proteinuria, chronic kidney disease, and
pregnancy-related complications in women.
Through antenatal screening, VUR is suggested by
• APRPD <15 mm (15% incidence)
• APRPD >15 mm and PUJO is ruled out on DTPA scan
• Fluctuating renal pelvis anteroposterior diameter on serial
USGs
• Hydroureteronephrosis.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is made using MCUG done under antibiotic
cover (1 day before and 2 days after MCUG). Treatment of VUR
depends upon several factors especially severity of reflux and
includes chemoprophylaxis, surgical therapy in elect cases,
circumcision in boys, and only observation in infants with
grades 1–2 VUR.

Chapter 101: Antenatal Renal Anomalies: Outcome and Postnatal Management

PELVIURETERIC JUNCTION OBSTRUCTION
Pelviureteric junction obstruction is often due to lack of or
decreased ganglion cells with resultant decreased peristalsis.
It is suggested by APRPD greater than 15 mm and diagnosis is
confirmed by DTPA (or EC) renal scan at 2–3 months of age.
This renal scan is delayed until 2 months of age since there is
a natural maturation of renal function and GFR usually triples
that of newborn period at 2 months (~60 mL/min/1.73 m2)
that permits better visualization of the kidneys. Occasionally,
EC or MAG3 renal scan may be performed in the first few
weeks of life especially if there is bilateral severe HN or HN
in a solitary kidney. IVP essentially does not have a role in
diagnosis of PUJO.
Since the natural history of PUJO is that of spontaneous
resolution in a significant number of cases, majority of children
with PUJO can be managed conservatively. Conservative
management includes 3–4 monthly USG and DTPA renal scan
until 1 year of age and then 6 monthly for another 1 year. Early
detection and prompt treatment of UTI is very important.
Since the risk of UTI is low, chemoprophylaxis is usually not
indicated.
Surgery for PUJO is indicated in following conditions:
• Palpable renal mass
• Presence of cortical thinning
• APRPD >25 mm
• Split renal function <40% on DTPA renal scan
• Recurrent UTI’s.

MULTICYSTIC DYSPLASTIC KIDNEY
Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is the most common
cystic renal anomaly and occurs in approximately1 in 2,000
births. The MCDK is a nonfunctioning kidney characterized
by multiple noncommunicating cysts and absence of
identifiable renal parenchyma. It results from disturbance
in ureteric bud development during early pregnancy.
The differential diagnosis of MCDK includes severe PUJO
(dilated pelvi-calyceal system appears as “cysts”), autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease, and simple cysts (usually
single). There is a 25–30% incidence of renal anomalies on the
contra lateral side (i.e., the normal kidney). Of these, VUR
(reflux) is the most common followed by PUJO, VUJO, and
duplex system.
The natural history of MCDK includes spontaneous
involution/regression in 75% cases and decrease in size to
smaller than 5th percentile after 6 years of age in majority. The
outcome of children with MCDK is benign. The incidence of
hyper­
tension and malignancy/Wilm’s tumors is essentially
zero percent.
Evaluation of a neonate with antenatal suspicion of MCDK
includes
• Renal USG between 7 and 21 days of life
• DTPA/dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan at 3 months of
age
• MCUG at 3–6 months of age to rule out VUR on the normal
side.

ch-101.indd 495

Management of MCDK is conservative. Until mid-1980s,
infants were subjected to surgery (nephrectomy) that is now
reserved for infants with huge renal mass. Most children are
followed conservatively with:
• Renal USG once in a year for 5 years and then every
2–3 years
• Asessment of growth and blood pressure (BP) once a year
(routine)
• Moderate salt and nonvegetarian (meat) protein reduction
in family’s diet to decrease the risk of hypertension and
proteinuria in later life
• Avoidance of contact sports to prevent trauma to contralateral hypertrophied kidney.

POSTERIOR URETHRAL VALVES
Posterior urethral valves are the most serious and fortunately
less common of the antenatal renal anomalies. During
the antenatal period, PUV can be suggested by bilateral
hydroureteronephrosis/bilateral HN, echogenic renal cortex,
distended bladder, and decreased amniotic fluid. Adequate
AFI is one of the most important predictors of long-term renal
outcome in PUVs. Oligohydramnios is associated with more
than 75% incidence of renal failure and pulmonary hypoplasia.
Postnatal evaluation includes observation of urinary
stream, presence of renal and bladder mass, and respiratory
status (distress, oxygen requirement, lung expansion on
X-ray). Renal USG is to be performed on day 1–2 followed
by MCUG under antibiotic cover. Serial monitoring of renal
parameters and serum electrolytes including bicarbonate
is very important. In most cases, cystoscopy and primary
fulguration of valves can be performed in the neonatal period.
Postfulguration, infants need to be maintained on cephalexin
prophylaxis (until at least 6 months or longer duration in
presence of VUR). Long-term follow-up for growth, blood
pressure, metabolic acidosis (Type IV renal tubular acidosis),
and renal and bladder function is mandatory.
Approximately 25–30% of children with PUVs can progress
to end-stage renal disease (chronic renal failure). Poor
prognostic markers include oligohydramnios, bilateral high
grade VUR, and echogenic kidneys. Appropriate and timely
intervention can decrease the morbidity associated with PUVs.

Prenatal Counseling
Obviously, presence of fetal kidney dilatation causes parental
anxiety and raises a number of doubts regarding the immediate
and long-term outcome of the baby specifically regarding the
kidney function. Since most studies report lower incidence of
significant uropathies (PUV, PUJO, and VUR), first thing to do
is to reassure the family regarding the common nature and
usually benign course of most conditions. Most unilateral HN
or cystic kidneys have a good long-term outcome as long as
the other kidney is normal. When dealing with unilateral HN,
the family can be counseled regarding the step-wise work up
of the baby between birth and 3 months of age. Unilateral

495

Section 12: Nephrology
fetal HN of any severity does not need any intervention or
early delivery.
With bilateral severe HN, possibilities of PUV, VUR, PUJO
and other uropathies is discussed. Of all the uropathies,
PUV is the only one that is associated with chronic kidney
disease chronic renal failure in approximately 30% children.
Adequacy of amniotic fluid in the second and third trimester
is an important prognostic marker for future/long-term renal
function. If amniotic fluid is decreased (especially if AFI is <5
cm] in presence of bilateral HN, the risk of postnatal kidney
failure requiring dialysis and kidney transplantation is very
high (~90%). In case of VUR or PUJO, even if surgery is required,
the timing of surgery is usually between 2 and 24 months of age
and not immediately after birth.
The indication for early delivery is usually based on
obstetric factors. The only fetal factor that may necessitate early
delivery is when there is worsening oligohydramnios (usually
seen in boys with PUV or neurogenic bladder associated renal
dysplasia) After inducing lung maturation with steroids, early
delivery can then be planned.

CONCLUSION
Antenatal renal anomalies are being identified more
frequently. Postnatally, balance between overinvestigation
and underevaluation is required. The goal is to identify
significant nephrouropathy (such as PUV, VUR, PUJO, VUJO,
and MCDK) before long-term complications set in and
prevent complications such as recurrent UTI’s, renal stones,
hypertension, proteinuria, and kidney failure. Transient
(isolated or benign) HN is the most common cause of AH.
Unilateral HN can be completely evaluated by 3 months of
age starting with a renal USG between 7 and 14 days of life
followed by second USG at 2 months of age and then MCUG
(if APRPD is between 5 and 15 mm) or DTPA renal scan (if
APRPD > 15 mm). If renal USG is done in the first week of
life, a repeat renal USG should be performed between 2 and
4 weeks of age, once the urine output is established. Two
normal renal USGs (APRPD <5 mm) in first 2 –3 months of life
can rule out approximately 95% of urinary tract abnormalities.
Calyceal dilatation and cortical thinning always indicate a
serious pathology. Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis or severe
bilateral hydronephrosis should be evaluated with serial
creatinine, USG, and MCUG in first week of life (mainly to
detect PUV). The only major anomaly that should not be
missed before discharge of a new born baby boy is posterior
urethral valves.

Acute Kidney Injury
VK Sairam

INTRODUCTION
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden loss of renal function
that occurs due to multiple causes leading to a decline in
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and accumulation of urea and
nitrogenous waste products. It also results in fluid imbalance
and electrolyte dysregulation. The presence of AKI results in
increase in mortality and morbidity of children. Hence, it is
very essential that pediatricians are aware of this entity and be
competent to prevent and treat it.
The new terminology AKI has replaced acute renal failure.
It is now widely used by Nephrologists to indicate acute loss
of renal function. AKI presents with wide range of clinical
manifestation from a slight rise of serum creatinine to an
anuric renal failure. The rise in serum creatinine is considered
to be the marker of an acute event of the kidney. It has to be
remembered that serum creatinine rise is often delayed and
imprecise. It is a value that reflects GFR in a steady state and
does not reflect GFR in a patient with changing renal function.
Despite these limitations, serum creatinine continues to be the
most widely used laboratory parameter to indicate AKI.
The recognition for a definition for AKI, the pediatric
Risk, Injury, Failure, loss of kidney function, and End-stage
kidney disease (RIFLE) classification was proposed. This will
enable us to recognize children with AKI early and intervene
appropriately. It has graded levels of injury (risk, injury, failure,
loss of kidney function and ESRD) based on the elevation of
serum creatinine or urine output.
The etiology of AKI in developed countries in the last two
decades has been changing from primary glomerular diseases
to hospital-acquired renal diseases. The causes that lead to
hospital-acquired AKI are sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, and renal
ischemia. In developing countries, the etiology is due to dehy­
dration, sepsis, and primary renal diseases such as postinfective
glomerulonephritis (PIGN) and hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS). The incidence of AKI is increasing in developed countries
due to increased number of complicated patients taken care in
the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units.

ch-102.indd 497

CLASSIFICATION
The classification of AKI is based on the anatomic location of
initial injury. It is classified as prerenal, renal, and postrenal
locations for AKI.
Prerenal AKI in children is due to hypovolemia [bleeding or
gastrointestinal (GI) loss, or urinary loss or cutaneous, loss], or
reduction of effective circulatory volume (nephrotic syndrome,
cirrhosis, or septic shock)
Renal AKI is due to structural damage to the kidney due
to glomerular disease or prolonged hypoperfusion, sepsis, or
nephrotoxins.
Postrenal AKI is due to congenital or rarely acquired causes
of obstruction of lower urinary tract.

Clinical Pearl
• The clinician should evaluate and understand the site of renal
injury.

CLINICAL features
The signs and symptoms are directly related to the alteration of
renal function. These include edema, reduced urine output or
anuria, hematuria (microscopic or gross), hypertension, and in
some children, breathing difficulties. There may be features of
shock or heart failure or features of acute PIGN. There may be
in few children features of joint pain, rash, and associated renal
injury due to disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) or Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Rarely, patients
with interstitial nephritis can present with rash, malaise,
vomiting, and rise in serum creatinine.
On physical examination, edema, rise in blood pressure,
respiratory distress, weight gain, and signs of underlying
disease (PIGN, SLE, or HSP) can be detected. Also signs of
volume depletion (dry mucous membrane, decreased turgor,
orthostatic fall of blood pressure, or decreased blood pressure)
are all indicative of a prerenal AKI.

Section 12: Nephrology

Diagnosis
Elevated blood urea nitrogen or urea and serum creatinine is a
hallmark of AKI. Abnormal urine analysis is feature of nephritis.
Other features such as hyperkalemia, hypo- or hypernatremia,
high anion gap acidosis, hypocalcemia, or hyperphosphatemia
are noted in AKI.

Urinalysis
Urine analysis is very helpful to detect the cause of AKI. The
presence of red blood cell casts, dysmorphic red blood cells,
and proteinuria are all indicative of nephritic urinary sediment.
Muddy-brown granular casts is suggestive of acute tubular
necrosis. Pyuria with white cell casts is indicative of urinary
tract infections. White cell casts can also be seen in acute
glomerulonephritis. The positive response to heme on dipstick
with absence of RBC in the sediment is seen in patients with
hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis. Patients with prerenal AKI have
a normal urine analysis.
Urine specific gravity is less than 1.010 in acute tubular
necrosis (ATN). Patients with prerenal disease have a specific
gravity greater than 1.020.
Urine osmolality is more accurate measure of the
concentrating ability. Patients with ATN have an osmolality of
less than 350 mosmol/kg and patients with prerenal disease
have osmolality greater than 500 mosmol/kg.
Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is used to
differentiate prerenal AKI and intrinsic AKI.

FENa =

Urine sodium × Serum creatinine
× 100
Serum sodium × Urine creatinine

Less than 1% prerenal, greater than 2% intrinsic renal AKI
FENa in neonates is higher. Less than 2% prerenal, greater
than 2.5% intrinsic renal AKI.

Other Investigations
Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine greater than 20 suggestive of
prerenal AKI and 10–20 suggestive of ATN.
Complete blood count with a peripheral smear is suggestive
of thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia in patients with
HUS. The presence of blasts cells are seen in patients with
leukemia with tumor lysis-associated AKI. The presence of
eosinophils in the urine is suggestive of interstitial nephritis.
Complement levels C3 is low in PIGN, membrano­
proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and SLE.
Serological testing for streptococcal infection is required
in patients with PIGN. In patients with drug-induced
nephrotoxicity, the drug levels are measured such as levels
of aminoglycosides or acetaminophen. The rise in the levels
of uric acid is seen in patients with leukemia, and lymphoma
associated with tumor lysis syndrome. Lactate dehydrogenase
is increased in patients with HUS, hemolytic disorders, or
malignancies.

Biomarkers

Novel biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated
lipocalin, kidney injury molecule, or interleukin-18 have

ch-102.indd 498

prognostic utility in setting of AKI and may allow clinicians to
diagnose early and intervene.

Renal Imaging
Renal ultrasound is useful in patients whose etiology of AKI is
not clear. The presence of a normal architecture of the kidneys
is reassuring to the nephrologist. The presence of small-sized
kidney means the etiology is of long-standing chronic disease.
An acute injury to the kidney results in increased size of the
kidney. The echogenicity is increased in patients with AKI or
in patients with a chronic kidney disease. Renal ultrasound is
diagnostic in patients with obstructive etiology such as posterior
urethral valves, neurogenic bladder, or high grade reflux.
Renal biopsy is rarely required in patients with AKI. It is
done in patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
(RPGN) to enable guide therapy. Similarly, in patients with
lupus nephritis associated AKI, renal biopsy is indicated.
Once diagnosis of AKI is made, then further evaluation is
focussed on determining the cause. The evaluation consists
of history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation.
Renal imaging is performed in most patients. Renal biopsy is
very rarely required.

Clinical Pearl
• Urinalysis is an essential initial investigation in evaluation of a
child with acute kidney injury and often forgotten.

TREATMENT
The management of a child with AKI should be initiated
immediately under the guidance of a pediatric nephrologist.
It is very essential to first assess the fluid status of the child
and identify the etiology of AKI. The treating physician has to
deal with the volume issues of the child and decide to treat
accordingly (Algorithm 1). Any treatable underlying causes
of AKI should be considered, such as RPGN and septic AKI,
should be treated accordingly.
The principles of treatment of a child with AKI are:
(Algorithm 2)
• Hypovolemic children require normal saline bolus of
10–20 mL/kg over 30 minutes repeated twice as needed.
This is given to restore the renal function to prevent the
progression of prerenal AKI to intrinsic renal AKI.
• In euvolemic children, fluid should be administered to a
total of urine output in addition to insensible water loss
(400–500 mL/m2/day).
• Hypervolemic children with fluid overload require fluid
removal and restriction of fluid intake. Furosemide is
attempted to convert oliguric to nonoliguric AKI, thereby
making it easy for the treating physician to give fluids and
nutrition without altering the overall course of the disease.
If the bolus of lasix (2–5 mg/kg/dose) provide a response
immediately and the AKI is less than 24-hour duration,
then a continuous lasix infusion (0.1–0.3 mg/kg/h) can be
provided.
• In critically sick children, percent fluid overload correlates
with overall survival rate. Fluid overload more than 10%

initiate renal replacement therapy if the fluid overload is

Admission weight
Electrolyte dysregulation, such as hyperkalemia, hyper­
phosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and elevated anion gap
metabolic acidosis is common in AKI and needs treatment
accordingly. Children with AKI develop hypertension due to
fluid overload or renin mediated and requires monitoring and
treatment accordingly.
Acute kidney injury is associated with increased catabolic
rate and therefore, good nutritional support is needed
to enable good recovery. It is also very essential to avoid
nephrotoxic drugs and all renally excreted drugs should be
adjusted to a GFR of less than 10 mL/min irrespective of the
present serum creatinine.
The renal replacement therapies are hemodialysis,
peritoneal dialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy.
The choice of therapy depends on clinical situation and the
expertise of the treating physician. The indications of renal
replacement therapy are fluid overload, hyperkalemia, uremia,
and life-threatening pulmonary edema or hypertension.

Enuresis
Jyoti Sharma

INTRODUCTION

Table 1: Conditions that may precipitate secondary enuresis

Enuresis refers to intermittent incontinence in discrete episodes
while asleep; sometimes called nocturnal enuresis (NE) to
add extra clarity. It is essential to subgroup these children as
having monosymptomatic (MNE) and nonmonosymptomatic
enuresis (NMNE). The latter refers to children who have
concomitant symptoms of lower urinary tract (LUT)
malfunction, i.e., increased (>eight times) or decreased (<three
times) voiding frequency, daytime incontinence, urgency,
hesitancy, straining, a weak stream, intermittency, holding
maneuvers, a feeling of incomplete emptying, postmicturition
dribble, and genital or LUT pain.

Clinical Pearl
• Nonmonosymptomatic enuresis is more common; when a
detailed history is obtained, the majority of children have at
least subtle daytime symptoms
• Children and adult perceptions of daytime voiding symptoms
differ. Hence, careful questioning of the child is recommended.

Genetic influences on primary NE are heterogenous and
complex. When one or both parents have a history of enuresis,
the incidence in children is 44 and 77% respectively, compared
with a 15% incidence in children whose parents do not have a
history of enuresis.
The term secondary enuresis is used to describe children
who have had a previous dry period of at least 6 months;
otherwise the term primary enuresis should be used. A
cause for secondary enuresis can usually be identified and
management is directed toward this (Table 1).
Dysfunctional voiding, which may also be associated with
enuresis is characterized by an intermittent and/or fluctuating
uroflow rate due to urethral sphincter overactivity during
voiding in children with normal neurological function. This
leads to very high filling and voiding pressures, prolonged

voiding, incontinence, urinary retention, renal scarring, and

history and abnormal uroflowmetry since it requires specific
management.
The focus of this chapter is MNE and NMNE with symptoms
of an overactive bladder and does not address conditions
requiring special investigations and management, including
dysfunctional voiding.

PATHOGENESIS
The three factors presumed to play a role in the pathogenesis
and hence, also targeted for management are:
1. A disorder of sleep arousal: children do not wake up to the
sensation of a full or contracting bladder
2. Nocturnal polyuria
3. A reduced nocturnal bladder capacity.
Nocturnal polyuria may be due to a combination of factors
that include a low fluid intake during the school hours and large
intakes in the evening, a high solute intake (dinner) close to the
bedtime, and a low nocturnal secretion of antidiuretic hormone.

11/21/2016 12:57:03 PM

Chapter 103: Enuresis
Reduced functional nocturnal bladder capacity increases
with age, so younger children have a small normal functional
bladder capacity. Presence of constipation further reduces
bladder capacity and enhances the prevalence of bedwetting.
The bladder is located in the narrowest dependant portion of
the funnel formed by the pelvic bones and it cannot escape the
impact of stool in the small pelvis of a child. Also, nocturnal
colonic movement may stimulate detrusor contractions.
Other comorbid conditions associated with NE that need
to be addressed for successful therapy are neuropsychiatric
disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) and sleep disordered breathing due to adenotonsillar
hypertrophy.

EVALUATION (See Algorithm 1)
History
The most important aspect of the investigation is a meticulous
history, which can establish the diagnosis, lead to more precise
treatment recommendations, and minimize the need for
invasive and expensive investigations.
Parents are requested to maintain a record over 2–3 days
in a frequency-volume chart and record of bowel movements
during a week. Points to be noted are details of fluid intake,
daytime voiding pattern, and number and time of episodes
of bedwetting. Some children void with a normal frequency
or even a reduced frequency and yet have a low functional
Algorithm 1
Evaluation and management of a child

bladder capacity; these children often do not drink appreciably
during the day, and urinary frequency is evident only after a
fluid load. Other details required are a sleep history that
should include the times the child goes to bed, falls asleep,
and awakens in the morning, and the presence of snoring.
Presence of an overactive bladder or dysfunctional voiding
e.g., Vincent’s curtsy, that usually present with frequency,
urgency, maneuvers to suppress the urge to void (squatting
behavior), and daytime and nighttime wetting should be noted.
Constipation and cystitis are common associated problems
in patients with overactive bladder or dysfunctional voiding.
Differential diagnoses, such as neurogenic bladder and
ectopic ureter, can be excluded on history. Neuropsychiatric
abnormalities, if any, need to be identified.

Clinical Pearls
Usefulness of a voiding diary
• Provides objective data that may support the history
• Helps detect children with nonmonosymptomatic enuresis
• Detects children who require extra evaluation
• Detects families with low adherence to instructions

Physical Examination
The examination should be carried out to exclude pathological
causes of incontinence, i.e., measurement of blood pressure,
inspection of external genitalia and of the lumbosacral spine,
palpation in the renal and suprapubic areas to look for enlarged
kidneys or bladder, and a thorough neurologic examination of
the lower extremities. Abnormal physical findings are absent in
children when enuresis is the sole symptom.

Laboratory Testing and Imaging Studies
A urinalysis is warranted in all children to rule out urinary
tract infection and glycosuria. A high specific gravity in a urine
specimen obtained in the afternoon suggests low fluid intake
during the day. Ultrasonography (USG) of the pelvis is helpful
in children with day time symptoms. USG performed when
the child feels the bladder is “full,” can be used to estimate
functional bladder capacity, which can be compared with
norms for bladder capacity according to age (Box 1). USG
should also be performed after voiding to assess the patient for
bladder wall thickness and residual urinary volume; abnormal
parameters suggest NMNE.
Box 1: Expected bladder capacity
• >2 years of age: {Age (years) + 2} × 30 mL
• Maximum bladder capacity is too small if <65% or too large if
>130% of expected bladder capacity.

Clinical Pearls
Red flags on ultrasonography
• Thick bladder wall (>5 mm after voiding)
• Elevated residual urinary volume (>20 mL)

MANAGEMENT

Clinical Pearl

Enuresis that occurs as infrequently as once a month is
associated with reduced self-esteem, and treatment has been
reported to improve self-esteem, regardless of the type or
the success of therapy. Management should be instituted
as soon as the child is motivated to be dry and the parents
are supportive. An explanation of the probable cause of the
enuresis is important. Motivation of the child needs to be
sustained by providing emotional support and an attempt to
remove any feelings of guilt. Efforts of the child to remain dry
need to be rewarded with praise.

Behavioral Therapy
Behavioral modification directed at good bladder and bowel
health offers the potential to cure NE without the need for
medication (Box 2). It also increases the success rate of
the alarm or pharmacological therapy. Clinical experience
suggests that the ability to establish a rapport with the child and
to induce and sustain motivation is important for successful
behavioral therapy.

Box 2: Behavioral therapy: good bladder and bowel habits
• Advice regarding timed voiding, i.e., every 3–4 hours, frequent
enough to avoid urgency/incontinence, including during school
hours; and before going to bed
• Voiding should be unhurried and complete
• Instructions to drink liberal amounts during the day (50 mL/kg/
day), not to drink excess with the evening meal, and to minimize
fluid intake afterward
• Encouragement toward good bowel health, characterized by
a soft bowel movement, with a diameter less than 2 or 3 cm,
passed without discomfort every morning before the child
leaves for school
• Strategies to improve bowel emptying include the intake of
foods that soften stool, use of a stool softener, and patient and
parent education about optimal posture to relax the pelvic floor
muscles. Children should be counseled not to rush or push

• Training programs that involve either “holding on” and waiting
before voiding or stopping the flow of urine have not been
shown to be effective, hence have no role.

If the above preliminary management program does not
result in dryness in 3 months, then the use of an alarm should
be considered.

Alarm Therapy
Alarm therapy is presumed to cure NE by the conditioning effects
on arousal and by increasing nocturnal bladder capacity. The
device consists of a sensor, attached to the child’s underwear
or to a mat placed below the child, which is activated when
the child begins to wet the bed. It works on the principle that
sustained use causes conditioned wakening to a full bladder.
Success with alarm therapy is related to the motivation of the
child and that of the parent who must participate in the therapy.
It requires a minimum 3-month trial. Its use results in dryness in
about two-thirds of children and the relapse can be minimized
with behavioral therapy prior to alarm therapy, by close followup during therapy, and by ‘overlearning’, which involves slowly
increasing the evening fluid intake in successfully treated patients
while continuing to wear the alarm.

Pharmacological Treatment
Pharmacological options are resorted when behavioral therapy
and alarm fail (Table 2).
Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) reduces nocturnal polyuria
but relapse rates are high and offers only a control rather than
a cure of the NE. It is recommended when fast-acting, shortterm improvement is the priority, if alarm treatment is not
successful, or the parents or child no longer want to use an
alarm. It is most effective in children 8 years and older who
have MNE with nocturnal polyuria, normal bladder capacity,
and infrequent bed wetting. The immediate onset of action
of DDAVP allows the flexibility of intermittent administration

for special occasions or long-term use to maintain dryness.
For long-term use, DDAVP may be used for 3 months then
3-month quantities; a slow stepwise dose reduction over 6–7
months decrease relapse rates after discontinuation of therapy.
The International Children’s Continence Society reco­
mmends that imipramine should be used only when all other
therapies have failed, only after assessment by a healthcare
professional who specializes in the management of bedwetting
that has not responded to treatment. It should not to be used in
combination with an anticholinergic.
Imipramine facilitates urine storage by decreasing bladder
contractility and increasing outlet resistance. It inhibits reuptake
of norepinephrine or serotonin (5-hydro­
xytryptamine) at
presynaptic neuron. Parents should be warned about the
potentially serious, dose-related adverse effects of cardiac
arrhythmias. Reboxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor,
is pharmacologically related to imipramine but is without
apparent cardiovascular toxicity. Further study is needed to
define the role of this agent in clinical practice.
Anticholinergics are indicated when bladder capacity is
found to be small or when there are symptoms of detrusor
instability (urge syndrome).
Nocturnal enuresis is more common in children with
ADHD, behavioral problems and adenotonsillar hypertrophy.
Treatment of these conditions is important for success of
management. Complete success of therapy is said to have
occurred when there is no relapse even after 2 years of
discontinuing therapy.

CONCLUSION
Nocturnal enuresis is very common and has the potential
for an appreciable negative emotional impact on affected
children. It is important to differentiate MNE from NMNE
and pathological conditions associated with enuresis.
Behavioral modification promoting good bladder and bowel

habits and alarm therapy is the mainstay of management of
NE. Pharmacological therapy is indicated when there are
additional symptoms and when behavioral and alarm therapy
fail. Treatment for comorbid conditions, like constipation
and ADHD, must be offered simultaneously.

Approach to Renal
Tubular Disorders in Children
Manoj G Matnani

INTRODUCTION
Renal tubules are the real brains of the kidney. They reabsorb
most of the glomerular ultrafiltrate and fine tune the
remainder of urine by the processes of concentration, dilution,
acidification, and secretion in order to maintain an intact
homeostatic milieu on a continuous basis.
Hence, it is obvious that disorders of the renal tubules will
lead to serious fluid-electrolyte and acid base disturbances,
affecting the growth and development of the child and
sometimes even pose a serious threat to survival.

Table 1: Clinico-physiologic correlation of renal tubular
disorders

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY (Table 1)
Functionally, various diseases affecting a particular segment of
the kidney lead to the following pathophysiological features:
• Disorders affecting the proximal tubule, which is the main
site of reabsorption of multiple solutes, e.g., Fanconi’s
syndrome
• Disorders affecting the loop of Henle and the early parts
of the distal tubule, which fine tune the sodium chloride
reabsorption and potassium secretion, e.g., Bartter’s
syndrome and its variants
• Disorders affecting the a-intercalated cells of the cortical
collecting ducts, which is the main site for hydrogen ion
secretion (aldosterone sensitive segment), e.g., distal
renal tubular acidosis (RTA), type 4 RTA, and pseudo­
hypoaldosteronism
• Disorders affecting the medullary collecting ducts, which
is the anti diuretic hormone (ADH) sensitive segment
(responsible for water reabsorption through aquaporin
channels), e.g., nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI).
• Disorders affecting primarily the phosphate (PO43–)
reabsorption by the proximal tubule, e.g., X-linked
hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHHR)

Determine the urine pH: It is useful for assessing the
integrity of distal urinary acidification.
Presence of urine pH greater than 5.5 during metabolic
acidosis suggests defective distal secretion of H+ (distal
RTA); urine pH smaller than 5.5 is seen in proximal RTA
or in patients with selective aldosterone deficiency (type 4
RTA)
If systemic acidosis is absent, an oral ammonium chloride
(0.1 mg/kg) load (acid load test) is given to induce acidosis
and the capacity of the distal tubule to secrete H+ is
assessed by serial monitoring of the blood and urine pH
(done at higher centers as an inpatient procedure)
To characterize the type of RTA, bicarbonate loading test
is done
{{ Measurement of fractional excretion of bicarbonate
(FEHCO3) and urine to blood CO2 gradient (U-B CO2)

following nomogram.
Distal RTA (type 1): All patients should undergo:
• Hearing evaluation to diagnose proton adenosine
triphosphatase channel defects causing distal RTA
• Renal ultrasound for medullary nephrocalcinosis (Fig. 3)

Hypercalciuria (see appendix 1 for normal values) and
hyperphosphaturia occur due to:
–– The release of calcium phosphate from bone in
order to buffer excess H+ during acidosis
–– The direct effects of acidosis on tubular reabsorption
of these ions
Hypocitraturia results from:
–– Citrate utilization in proximal tubular cells
–– Due to high luminal pH favoring conversion of
citrate3– to the readily absorbable citrate2–

TTKG = Urine K+ × Plasma osmolality
It is an index of K+ gradient in the distal tubular lumen

Normal range is 6–12.
• Hypokalemia from extrarenal causes results in renal K+
conservation and TTKG smaller than 2
• Higher TTKG suggests renal losses, as seen in hyper­
aldosteronism
• During hyperkalemia, the expected TTKG should be
greater than 10, an inappropriately low level suggests
hypoaldosteronism or tubular resistance to aldosterone.

Key points

))
Early diagnosis of renal tubular disorders is of paramount
importance as most of them present with recurrent lifethreatening episodes of vomiting and dehydration
))
Early treatment is essential as it prevents growth failure,
stunting, and wasting along with metabolic bone compli­
cations like recurrent pathological fractures, osteopenia etc.

))
Early treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) prevents
grave consequences like medullary nephrocalcinosis and
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hence it is a preventable
cause of ESRD
))
Early treatment of distal RTA leads to good catch up growth
in children
))
It is important to rule out renal tubular disorder in patients
presenting with recurrent dehydration as the blood gas
and electrolyte abnormalities frequently overlap in both
the conditions (e.g., metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia in
gastroenteritis and RTA, metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia
in vomiting and Bartter’s syndrome)
))
Children with obstructive uropathy should undergo a detailed
renal tubular evaluation to categorize the tubulopathy.

Nephrotic Syndrome in Children
Mukta Mantan, Anand S Vasudev

INTRODUCTION
Nephrotic syndrome is a common chronic disorder in children,
characterized by heavy proteinuria (>40 mg/m²/h in timed
urine sample), hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The proteinuria
in nephrotic syndrome is relatively selective and constitutes
primarily of albumin. The peak incidence of the disease is in
between 2 and 6 years of age. Ninety percent of the children with
minimal change disease respond to treatment with steroids.
Majority of these relapse and about 50–60% become steroiddependent or frequent relapsers. Frequency of relapses is higher
in first 10 years after the diagnosis. By puberty the relapse rate
decreases and most children show sustained remission.
Some common definitions to define the course of nephrotic
syndrome are tabulated in table 1.
The most common etiology of childhood nephrotic
syndrome is minimal change disease. The other glomerular

Two or more relapses in 6 months of initial
response or four or more in any 12-month period
Occurrence of 2 consecutive relapses during
steroid therapy or within 2 weeks of its cessation in
absence of infections
Failure to achieve remission after 4 weeks of daily
therapy of steroids (prednisolone oral) 2 mg/kg/day
Nonresponse to initial steroid therapy
(2 mg/kg/day daily for 4 weeks)
Failure to respond in subsequent relapses after
initial response to steroids

etiologies causing nephrotic syndrome are focal segmental
glomerular sclerosis, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis,
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and membranous
nephropathy.

EVALUATION
The primary evaluation of a child with suspected nephrotic
syndrome includes estimation of serum total proteins, albumin,
globulin, cholesterol, urea, and creatinine concentrations.
Urinary proteins can be estimated with dipsticks. Values
of more than +3 proteins are indicative of nephrotic range
proteinuria. Urinary spot samples can be used for determining
the urinary protein or creatinine ratio. Values beyond 2 are
suggestive of nephrotic range proteinuria. Hepatitis B status
status should be determined if the child is unimmunized.
Serum complement (C3) levels are recommended if persistent
hematuria or hypertension occurs.

INDICATIONS FOR RENAL BIOPSY
Renal biopsy is indicated for children with steroid-resistant
nephrotic syndrome, age at onset below 1 year or more than
12 years, gross or persistent microscopic hematuria, or persistent
hyper­
tension. Children with features suggestive of systemic
lupuserythematosus, other secondary causes of nephrotic
syndrome, or before starting calcineurin inhibitors should also
be biopsied.

MANAGEMENT OF NEPHROTIC
SYNDROME INCLUDES SPECIFIC
AND SUPPORTIVE MANAGEMENT
Specific Management
Treatment of the Initial Episode
Indian Society of Pediatric Nephrology currently recommends
that initial episode of nephrotic syndrome be treated with

11/24/2016 2:23:33 PM

Chapter 105: Nephrotic Syndrome in Children
prednisolone at 2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) or 60 mg/m2 in single or
divided dose for 6 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg (max 40 mg)
or 40 mg/m2 single morning dose on alternate days for next
6 weeks.

Management of Relapse
Identify and treat any infections present. Prednisolone is
administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day until protein is nil or
trace for 3 consecutive days followed by 1.5 mg/kg/day on
alternate days for 4 weeks and then discontinued abruptly.

Frequent Relapser and Steroid-dependent
Long-term alternate day oral prednisolone is the initial
strategy. Slow tapering of prednisolone is done to reach to
a maintenance dose of 0.25–0.5 mg/kg on alternate days.
These doses are given for prolonged periods of 9–18 months.
Requirement of steroids at doses more than 0.5 mg/kg/day is
an indication for use of alternative agents. The commonly used
steroid sparing drugs are levamisole, mycophenolate mofetil,
and alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil).
Calcineurin inhibitors like cyclosporine and tacrolimus are
used sparingly for steroid-sensitive disease (Algorithm 1).
Specific drug usage is given in table 2.

Steroid-resistant Disease
All patients with minimal change disease, focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis, or mesangioproliferative changes on renal
biopsy are treated with calcineurin inhibitors like cyclosporine
and tacrolimus. The duration of treatment is at least 2–3 years
for steroid-resistant disease. The response rate to these agents
is about 70–80%. Intravenous steroids like methylprednisolone
and dexamethasone have been used for prolonged periods in
the past, but due to their poor response rates and high toxicity,
their use is discouraged. Intravenous cyclophosphamide
monthly pulses in doses of 500 mg/m² for 6 doses along with
low dose alternate day steroids have a response rate of about
50%. This drug can be used if the cost of calcineurin inhibitors
is a constraint.

Supportive Management
Diet
A balanced diet adequate in protein (1.5–2 g/kg) and calories
is recommended. Fats should provide less than 30% calories
and saturated fats should be avoided. Salt restriction is advised
only for patients with persistent edema or hypertension.

Approach to Short Stature
Vaman V Khadilkar, Supriya Phanse Gupte

INTRODUCTION
Short stature although common can be a challenging problem
to deal with. Growth monitoring of children from birth till
adulthood provides invaluable information toward diagnosis
and management of a whole range of pediatric disorders.
Growth monitoring can prevent loss in the adult height, which
may occur if diagnosis is delayed. Therefore, it is very important
to monitor growth of the child on a regular basis. Parents often
bring their child with complaint of short stature because they
compare the height of the child with his/her peers at school.
This can be misleading and needs to be confirmed by use of
appropriate growth charts.
When a short child is referred, following important points
need to be considered:
• Define whether the child is actually short or not using
appropriate growth charts
• Differentiate a short normal child from a child with an
organic cause
• Decide whether a child can be monitored or needs
immediate referral.

DEFINITION
A child is short if the height is less than 2 standard deviations
(SDs) below the mean for age and gender for country specific
updated population standards. However, a child falling much
below his midparental (target) range percentile and a child
having a poor growth velocity (<25th percentile) also needs to
be investigated.

ETIOLOGY
Most of the children presenting with short stature have
physiological causes, namely familial short stature and
constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP). Chronic
illness and malnutrition also form major contributors in

ch-106.indd 514

a developing country like India. A small number have an
endocrinopathy, a syndrome, or a skeletal dysplasia.
A wide variety of conditions both physiological and
pathological can lead to short stature in children. In many
cases, short stature may be the only presentation of the
disease and therefore, investigating the cause of short stature
is important.

Familial Short Stature
These are usually normal short children born to short parents.
Their height falls below the 3rd percentile of population
standards but is within the midparental height range. However,
they need monitoring of growth velocity to ensure normal
growth. Rarely, short stature in both the parents is caused by
a heterozygous condition manifesting in a mild form and the
child may be a homozygote with severe short stature such as
in familial cases of growth hormone deficiency. In dominantly
inherited conditions such as hypochondroplasia, the affected
parent is short and transmits the mutated gene to the offspring
resulting in short stature in the child. Treatment of these
children is warranted.

Constitutional Delay in Growth and Puberty
This is usually seen in boys. These children grow well in infancy
and early childhood. Thereafter, their height begins to falter
on growth charts and usually lies just below the 3rd percentile
below mid-parental height (MPH). It cruises parallel to the
3rd percentile from thereon. They also have delayed puberty
further worsening the growth pattern at puberty. Family history
of short stature in childhood and adolescence, late pubertal
spurt, and achievement of final height as per genetic potential
usually exists, mostly in the father. These children usually
follow the same trend and will achieve their final height as per
their genetic potential. If the puberty is delayed beyond the age
of 15 years, it may require treatment in the form of small dose
of sex steroids.

Malnutrition and Chronic Illness
Chronic malnutrition leads to stunting of growth due to lack
of nutrient supply, associated illnesses leading to a state of
catabolism, anemia, and micronutrient deficiency. Chronic
illnesses, such as chronic anemia, chronic kidney disease,
liver disease, heart and respiratory disease including asthma,
are catabolic states. In addition, poor appetite, electrolyte
imbalance and congestive heart failure further worsen the
condition. Malabsorption syndromes including celiac disease
also cause stunting.

Growth Hormone Deficiency
These children usually have normal weight and height at birth.
They grow normally in the first year of life as growth in this
phase is influenced by nutrition and is mediated by insulin
and related growth factors. Growth falters in early childhood
leading to severe stunting. They have immature facies,
childlike voice, and small hands and feet. Body proportions

ch-106.indd 515

are preserved. Obesity is uncommon in Indian children
unlike their counterparts in Western countries. They have
low stimulated growth hormone levels, insulin-like growth
factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3. They
respond well to growth hormone therapy. Rare exceptions
are conditions with growth hormone antibodies and growth
hormone insensitivity syndromes.

Hypothyroidism
Short stature can be the presenting complaint of children
with acquired hypothyroidism. They are short and puffy with
coarse facies. Occasionally, a child with less severe congenital
hypothyroidism (e.g., dyshormonogenesis) may present in
childhood for the first time.

Cushing Syndrome
In childhood, it is usually the result of exogenous steroid
administration or adrenal tumors. Rarely, in older children,
a pituitary lesion or a carcinoid tumor may be the cause.
These children are short and obese. Other stigmata, such as
purplish striae, muscular weakness, and buffalo hump, are
not commonly seen in children. Hypertension is an important
indicator of this disorder in children.

Turner Syndrome
Short stature is a consistent feature of Turner syndrome
especially as the child grows older. The other stigmata include
webbing of neck, low posterior hair line, antimongoloid
slant, widely spaced nipples, wide carrying angle, Madelung
deformity, and short 4th/5th metacarpals or metatarsals. They
develop ovarian failure early in life and so have no/delayed
puberty and infertility. They are predisposed to autoimmune
disorders such as autoimmune thyroid disease and celiac
disease. Higher incidence of coarctation of aorta, left sided
heart disease, renal disorders, and pigmented nevi have been
noted in these children. All features may not be present in
most children and short stature may be the only indicator of
the disorder. Growth hormone is a licensed indication for
treatment of short stature in Turner syndrome.

Psychosocial Short Stature
Emotionally deprived children do not grow well. They do not
respond to nutritional supplementation or any other form
of treatment. However, it is a reversible condition and these
children grow well once placed in a loving environment as
their pituitary hypothalamic function reverts to normal when
they live in a stress free environment.

Small for Gestational Age Sequelae
Most small for gestational age (SGA) children catch up by
2–4 years of age. However, up to 30% do not catch up. Those
who fail to catch up and remain below -2.5 SD score for the
population are candidates for growth hormone therapy.
Skeletal dysplasias, hypophosphatemic rickets, and
pseudo­hypoparathyroidism form rare causes of short stature
and should be looked for.

MANAGEMENT

Clinical Pearl

Measurement of Height/Length
It is important to accurately measure height with a stadiometer,
to avoid errors in measurement. For children less than 2 years
of age, the length is measured with the child in supine position
with the help of an infantometer.

Calculate the Midparental Height (Target Height)
and the Target Range
Midparental height (MPH)

= (father’s height + mother’s
height + 13)/2 for boys and
= (father’s height + mother’s
height - 13)/2 for girls.

Target range = MPH ± 6 cm
Plot the child’s height, and target height (with target range)
on country specific contemporary growth charts: for children
under the age of 5 years, use of WHO 2006 growth standards is
recommended.
If previous height records are available, plot previous
height readings to observe the pattern of the growth.
Calculate the annual growth velocity as change in height
divided by change in time. For example, if a child grows 3 cm
in 6 months, the annualized growth velocity is 3 divided by half
year which is 6 cm.

Normal Growth Velocity
•
•
•
•
•

In 1st year: 25 cm/year
In 2nd year: 12 cm/year
In 3rd year: 6 cm/year
From 4th year till pubertal spurt: 5 cm/year
During puberty: 6–8 cm/year in girls and 10–12 cm/year in
boys.
Growth velocity can be plotted on growth velocity curves.
Growth velocity less than 25th percentile is abnormal and
needs investigations.
If previous height records are not available: assess the height of
the child in relation to the midparental height.
If the height of the child is more than 3rd percentile and
within target range, it is a normal child. No investigations are
needed. Serial height measurements need to be plotted on
growth charts at 6 monthly-yearly intervals. Monitor growth
velocity annually.
If height of the child is less than 3rd percentile but within
target range, it is a short normal child with familial short
stature. Continue annual plotting on growth chart and monitor
growth velocity. A high index of suspicion is needed to suspect
and diagnose a subtle growth disorder in parents, such as
hypochondroplasia, which may be inherited by the child.

Indications for Further Workup

Height less than -2.5 SD of population standard for age and
gender

Growth velocity has deteriorated and dropped below 25th
percentile.

• A child with height plot above the 3rd percentile may still be
abnormal if he falls below the target range or has a growth
velocity less than 25th percentile.

Preliminary Workup
History
A detailed history of duration of apparent short stature,
history of pubertal delay in adolescent boys and girls should
be noted. Evidence of chronic illnesses, such as renal, liver,
malabsorption, respiratory illness including asthma, and
tuberculosis, should be looked for.
History of severe headache, vomiting suggestive of
intracranial space occupying lesions, intracranial surgeries,
craniospinal irradiation, head trauma, history of other
malignancies, bone disorders, and prolonged steroid intake
would add valuable information.
Birth history including birth weight (SGA), birth length,
history of breech delivery, birth trauma, neonatal hypo­
glycemia, and neonatal jaundice should be asked for. Family
history of consanguinity, short stature, delayed puberty, sterile
uncle/aunts, and tuberculosis should be reviewed.
Developmental history suggestive of delayed milestones,
and visual disturbances (r/o anatomical causes like corpus
callosum agenesis, septo-optic dystrophy associated with
multiple pituitary hormone deficiency) could be pointers
toward an anatomical brain abnormality and congenital
hypothyroidism.
A proper assessment of dietary intake helps to ensure
adequate calorie intake and assess for malnutrition. Social
history to assess for signs of child abuse and neglect should be
looked for.

Anthropometry
Interpreting the severity of height and weight deficit can be
very useful to reach the diagnosis. This can be assessed by
calculating child’s height age and weight age.
Height age is assessed by drawing a horizontal line from
the present height plot to the 50th percentile and drawing a
perpendicular on the X-axis (age in years) on the growth chart.
The point on the X-axis where the perpendicular meets, gives
the height age. Weight age is calculated in a similar way. If the
weight age is more retarded than the height age, it is a case of
malnutrition, chronic disease, or syndrome. The height age
is more retarded than the weight age in endocrinopathies as
weight is usually preserved.
In addition to height and weight, the upper segment/lower
segment ratio (US/LS ratio) provides useful information and
helps in establishing a definite etiology. The lower segment is
measured from the superior border of pubic rami till the feet
with the child standing upright. The upper segment (vertexpubic symphysis) is calculated by subtracting the lower
segment from the total height. Another method of assessing
US/LS ratio is by measuring the sitting height and subtracting
it from the standing height to get the subischial limb length.

This can be plotted on sitting height and subischial leg length

The US/LS ratio is 1.7:1 at birth. It gradually decreases
reaching to a ratio of 1:2 at around 7 years and 1.1:1 at 10 years.
It remains so till puberty when it further dips to 0.98:1 due to an
earlier spurt in limb height as compared to the spine growth.
Toward the end of puberty with an increase in spine height
with a nearly stabilized limb length, the ratio again rises to 1:1,
which persists thereafter.
Disproportionate short stature is seen in conditions
wherein the growth of either the limbs or spine is more
affected. In skeletal dysplasias, the limbs are more affected
and the spine is spared. An exception is spondyloepiphyseal
dysplasia wherein both the spine and limbs are affected.
Spinal shortening is seen in storage disease such as
mucopolysaccharidosis.

Clinical Pearl
• A short and thin child with weight most severely affected: think
of chronic illness, syndromic short stature, and malnutrition
• A short and overweight child: think of endocrinopathy—growth
hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, and Cushing syndrome.

Clinical Examination
It includes a thorough examination to look for any pointers of
a specific etiology of short stature. Facial dysmorphism adds
important information. Few of these are listed below.
Evidence of anemia, cyanosis, jaundice, signs of chronic
illness such as renal, liver, pulmonary disorders including
asthma and nutritional deficiency, including features of
malabsorption syndrome. Bony deformities including bow
legs, knock knees, kyphosis, and scoliosis would indicate
involvement of the skeletal system. A detailed systemic
examination would add to the information.

Clinical Pearl
• Short stature with anemia should raise suspicion of celiac
disease.

day-to-day practice.
	  The TW 3 atlas is more exhaustive method, wherein
13 or 20 ossification centers in the hand are scored. The
summation of these is then looked up in a table to give the
final bone age. This is more of a research tool.
	  Gilsanz and Ratib have recently released their own atlas
of bone age assessment which is very similar to Gruelich
and Pyle method with an added advantage of digital
processing.

Clinical Pearl
• Karyotype to rule out Turner syndrome is needed in all short
girls even in the absence of stigmata.

Interpretation of Growth Velocity
Child has normal growth velocity with growth curve
cruising below the 3rd percentile is a short normal child and
needs continued monitoring. He/she may need 2nd level
of investigations to rule out all causes before diagnosing as
idiopathic short stature. Growth hormone has been used to
treat short normal children who are below –2.5 SD and who are
not likely to achieve normal adult stature.

Management Strategies
Treatment of the underlying condition usually leads to
improvement in the growth velocity and catch up growth.

Growth Hormone
Growth hormone therapy is used in the following conditions:
Licensed indications:
• Growth hormone deficiency
• Small for gestational age sequelae
• Turner syndrome
• Prader-Willi syndrome
• Idiopathic short stature
• Chronic renal failure prior to renal transplant
• Glucocorticoid induced short stature
Conditions with doubtful benefit (under research at
present):
• Hypochondroplasia
• Chronic inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis
• Noonan syndrome
• Other skeletal dysplasia.
Recombinant human growth hormone is given in the form
of subcutaneous injections daily at bedtime for a period of at
least 2 years, ideally till the final height is achieved. Growth
hormone therapy is not useful once there is complete bony
fusion. Response depends on indication for which it is used,
age of starting therapy, duration of therapy, dose used, MPH,
and bone age at onset.
Although adverse effects are rare, they may include:
benign intracranial hypertension, hyperglycemia, worsening
of scoliosis, slipped capital femoral epiphyses, gynecomastia,
rash, and hives. Increased predisposition for neoplasia in
those with increased chromosomal breakage syndromes
has also been reported and is a contraindication to growth
hormone therapy.

Androgens
Depot testosterone in small doses of 50 mg monthly for
3–6 months has been used in boys with CDGP. It is used to trigger
the onset of pubertal spurt and usually results in attainment
of satisfactory final height. In some conditions wherein the
predicted adult height is less, it may be combined with growth
hormone. The disadvantage of testosterone is that it aromatizes
to estrogen and thus results in rapid bone maturation and
fusion. Oxandrolone, a nonaromatizable androgen is a better
alternative as it does not lead to early bony fusion.
Limb lengthening using Ilizarov may be offered for children
with achondroplasia.

CONCLUSION
It is necessary to differentiate a short normal child from a
short child with pathology. Treatment of only pathological
short stature is warranted. Growth hormone therapy is
indicated for special conditions, is usually for long term. The
therapy aims at achieving genetic potential and depends
on many factors, such as age at onset of therapy, etiology,
degree of short stature, and duration of therapy, contrary to
unrealistic expectations of most parents.

Childhood Obesity
Anurag Bajpai

INTRODUCTION
Childhood obesity has emerged as a global epidemic with
doubling of prevalence over the last two decades. Studies
from different parts of India have shown a rise in prevalence of
overweight and obesity from 15 to 28%. The risk of numerous
complications of early onset obesity imposes significant burden
on the individual and society. Moreover, most obese children
become obese adults. Timely evaluation and management of
childhood obesity is, therefore, crucial.

WHAT IS OBESITY?
The term implies excessive body fat, not merely excess body
weight. Thus, body weight alone is not a reliable marker of
obesity. The gold standard for diagnosis is increased body
fat measured by bioimpedance or dual energy enhanced
X-ray absorptiometry. These methods are cumbersome, used
mainly for research purposes. In practice, surrogate markers of
adiposity using a combination of height and weight are used.

Body Mass Index
Body mass index (BMI) should be used for diagnosing obesity
after 2 years of age. It takes into account the weight and height
of the individual.

BMI = Weight (kg) ÷ height (m)2
Body mass index correlates well with body fat and
complications in children; however it may incorrectly diagnose
obesity in muscular individuals, while under­
estimating
adiposity in sedentary children with reduced muscle mass.
Body mass index cutoffs for diagnosing obesity have been
developed using statistical distribution (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention charts) or extrapolating from adult
cutoffs (International Obesity Task Force). It varies with age,
ethnicity, and gender. Thus, age and gender specific local

ch-107.indd 520

charts should be used. Body mass index between 85th and
95th percentile for age indicates overweight, above the 95th
percentile suggests obesity, and greater than 99th percentile
(120% of 95th percentile) severe obesity.
For the same BMI, Indians have a greater risk of metabolic
syndrome compared to their Western counterparts. As the aim
of assessing BMI is to identify individuals at risk for metabolic
complications, lower BMI cutoffs have been recommended
for Indian adults (23 kg/m2 for overweight and 28 kg/m2 for
obesity). The applicability of lower cutoffs in Indian children
needs study.

Weight for Height
Weight for height should be used in children younger than
2 years of age. Weight for height more than 120% suggests
obesity.

Waist Circumference
Waist circumference is a marker of abdominal obesity, a
predictor of metabolic syndrome. Levels higher than 95th
percentile for age and gender are abnormal.

WHAT CAUSES OBESITY?
In most children, obesity is not due to a disease, but related
to lifestyle factors (constitutional obesity), while pathological
causes account for less than 1% cases (Table 1). It is important to
identify pointers to pathological obesity to avoid unnecessary
workup in children with constitutional obesity.

Clinical Pearl
• Obesity implies increased body fat and not weight; body mass
index may erroneously diagnose obesity in short, muscular
individuals.

Constitutional Obesity
Constitutional obesity results from an imbalance between
energy intake and expenditure. It is caused by a combination
of genetic and environmental factors. Family history is
common. Both low birth weight and high birth weight are
associated with increased risk of obesity later in life. Dietary
habits associated with childhood obesity include missing
meals (especially breakfast), higher portion size, snacking,
frequent eating out, and watching television while eating.
Breastfeeding in infancy has a protective effect. Lack of
activity and increased screen time are associated with obesity.

Clinical Pearl
• Childhood obesity is most commonly due to lifestyle factors.

Endocrine Causes
Endocrine diseases are rare but treatable causes of childhood
obesity. They should be considered in the presence of clinical
pointers, mainly growth failure and delayed puberty. Cushing
syndrome presents with central obesity, high blood pressure,
growth failure, and violaceous striae. Hypothyroidism is a rare
cause of isolated obesity, usually associated with growth failure
and developmental delay. In growth hormone (GH) deficiency
and pseudohypoparathyroidism, growth retardation and
hypocalcemia are dominant clinical features.

Monogenic Obesity
Single gene defects are a very rare cause of obesity, and
should be suspected with early onset obesity, rapid weight
gain and strong family history. Inefficient leptin action
(deficiency or resistance) results in uncontrolled appetite
and obesity. Abnormalities in mineralocorticoid receptor
and proconvertase have also been associated with obesity.
melanocortin 4 (MC4) receptor defects are the commonest
monogenic form of obesity and are associated with growth
acceleration.

Drugs
Commonly used drugs associated with obesity include
cortico­
steroids, antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone),
anti­­
depressants (paroxetine), and antiepileptics (valproate,
lamotrigine).

Clinical Pearl
• Think of pathological obesity in children with growth failure
and/or developmental delay. Constitutional obesity is more
likely if the child is tall and fat.

WHY BOTHER ABOUT OBESITY?
Childhood obesity is a predictor of a number of short- and
long-term complications (Table 2).

Endocrine
Endocrine complications are the most important adverse
effects of childhood obesity. Central to this is the development
of insulin resistance (IR), caused by overspill of fat and its
deposition in liver and skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance
predisposes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and non­
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Hyperandrogenism
is common in obese girls, as is accelerated growth, skeletal
maturation, and early puberty.

excessive appetite, signs and symptoms of CNS involvement,
and other hypothalamic-pituitary defects.

What Is the Cause of Obesity?

Obese children have a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia,
hypertension, atherosclerosis, and increased risk of adult
coronary disease. Importantly, hypertension may be masked,
warranting repeated blood pressure measurements.

Most obese children do not require investigations for the
cause. It is important to identify the children who need workup
by clinical examination (Table 3 and Algorithm 1).

Central Nervous System

The clinical evaluation should include detailed history and
examination. Pathological obesity should be considered
with early onset of obesity, rapid weight gain, growth failure,
dysmorphism, developmental delay, and pubertal delay.
Pointers to specific disorders should be evaluated (Tables 4
and 5). Detailed dietary history, including duration of
breastfeeding, age at weaning, meal pattern, calorie intake,
snacking, consumption of junk food, and features of feeding
disorders should be taken. Duration of activity and inactivity

Benign intracranial hypertension is common in children with
obesity and presents with headache and vomiting.

Orthopedic
These children have a higher risk of flat foot, Blount’s
disease, fractures, genu valgum, and osteoarthritis. The most
debilitating complication is slipped capital femoral epiphysis,
which presents with dull aching pain in the knee, hip or groin,
with abnormal gait. Blount’s disease (tibia vara) presents with
progressive bowing of legs and knee pain. X-ray of knee and
hip should be done in obese children with pain in hip or knee,
or abnormal gait.

Obesity is associated with gastroesophageal reflux and

associated with gall stone disease, which should be suspected
in an obese child with abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea, and
intolerance to fatty foods.

Approach to a child with obesity

Psychological
Obesity is associated with increased prevalence of mood
disorders. This represents intrinsic effects of obesity on one
hand and psychological effects of bullying on the other. It is
important to assess the effect of an obese child, as depression
increases the risk of obesity.

Clinical Pearl
• Obesity causes several short- and long-term complications,
including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
polycystic ovarian syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,
dyslipidemia, hyper­
tension, atherosclerosis, orthopedic
problems, obstructive sleep apnea, and mood disorders.

HOW TO EVALUATE A CHILD WITH OBESITY?
Evaluation involves careful clinical assessment followed by
focused investigations. The key questions are the cause of
obesity and its effects.

Cushing syndrome

Hirsutism, central obesity, growth

Assessment of complications of obesity should be done in
children with BMI above 95th percentile and those with BMI of
85th–95th percentile and family history of T2DM, hypertension,
PCOS, or acanthosis nigricans.

Hypothyroidism

Growth retardation, coarse facies,
developmental delay

Pseudohypopara­
thyroidism

Tetany, round facies, short 4th
metacarpal, cutaneous calcifications

should be looked into. Family history of consanguinity,
T2DM, ischemic heart disease, and dyslipidemia should
be inquired. Drug history should assess intake of steroids,
valproate, antipsychotic, and any other drugs. History of
CNS infection, trauma, radiation, tumor or surgery indicates
hypothalamic obesity.
Examination should include assessment of growth
parameters, pubertal status, and clues to diagnosis. Pubertal
assessment may be challenging. Parents of obese girls are often
concerned about premature thelarche. While this may reflect
true precocious puberty caused by obesity, it is most likely
due to increased fat and not true thelarche. To distinguish
these conditions, approximate the thumb and index finger
around the nipple: lack of resistance indicates lipomastia;
breast nodule can be felt as an area of resistance. Obese boys
frequently present with concerns of small penile size, which
is usually due to penis being buried in the suprapubic pad.
Stretched penile length should be measured after pressing the
suprapubic pad of fat, to ascertain the actual size of penis.

Clinical Pearl
• Lipomastia may look like thelarche. Buried penis in suprapubic
fat may give false impression of micropenis in obese boys.

Investigations
No workup for cause is required in children with normal
growth, facies, development, and pubertal development.
Thyroid profile and evaluation for Cushing (serum cortisol
at 8 am after dexamethasone at 11 pm) should be done in
the presence of growth failure and/or characteristic clinical
features. The effect of obesity on endocrine function should
be considered while assessing endocrine functions. Mildly
elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with
normal free thyroxine are common in obesity, and should
not be treated unless TSH is persistently and significantly
(>10 IU/mL) elevated. Similarly, cortisol levels may be mildly
elevated and easily suppressed, and should not be mistakenly

ch-107.indd 523

diagnosed as Cushing syndrome. Genetic testing for PraderWilli syndrome should be done in the presence of facial
features, history of infantile hypotonia, and growth failure.
Monogenic causes of obesity should be considered only in
the presence of clinical features or pointers to diagnosis.

When to Evaluate?

Clinical Evaluation
History should inquire about symptoms of complications
of obesity like headache, vomiting (benign intracranial
hypertension), day time somnolence, respiratory distress,
snoring (obstructive sleep apnea), abdominal pain (fatty liver,
gall stone disease), acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularity
(PCOS), pain in hip and knee (slipped capital femoral
epiphysis) or abnormal gait (Blount’s disease). Examination
should include measurement of blood pressure, acanthosis
nigricans, hepatomegaly, cardiac examination and pedal edema
(obstructive sleep apnea and cor pulmonale), and range of
movement of knee and hip (slipped capital femoral epiphysis).

Investigations
Investigations should include an oral glucose tolerance
test: blood sugars fasting and 2 hours after 1.75 g/kg glucose
(maximum of 75 g), lipid profile, and liver function tests. Age
appropriate cutoffs should be used for interpretation (Table 6).
These tests should be repeated every 3 years if normal. Fasting
insulin has limited role and is not routinely required; serum
insulin 2 hours post glucose load may be raised, though
there are no definite cutoffs in the pediatric age group. Mildly
elevated liver transaminases are common in obesity; persistent
elevation beyond twice the upper limit indicates nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis. Children with elevated transaminases should
undergo ultrasound abdomen and workup for other causes of
hepatic dysfunction (hepatitis B and C, Wilson disease, and

How to Manage a Child with Obesity?
Management is a big challenge, requiring a multidisciplinary
approach involving physician, nutritionists, and physical
trainers, with changes made by the entire family. The goal is to
bring BMI as close to the normal range for age and gender as
possible. Normalization may be difficult; excessive and rapid
weight loss adversely affects the growth of the child and should
be avoided. In most cases, weight stabilization is the initial
aim. Weight loss should not exceed 1 kg every month in most
children. The child and parents should be counseled that there
is no quick fix solution, and the family would need to adhere
to the modified lifestyle throughout life. The key focus is on
changing the lifestyle of the child and family, with use of drugs
and surgery in the rarest of rare cases.

Clinical Pearl
• Lifestyle measures should be adopted by the entire family, not
just the child.

Lifestyle Measures
This is the cornerstone to management. The whole family is
encouraged to follow a healthy lifestyle: focusing on the child
alone is counterproductive.

Nutritional Therapy
The child should be advised to eat regular meals. Skipping
meals and snacking between meals should be discouraged.
The caloric intake should be reduced by 20%. Overzealous
restriction and fad diets are not recommended. Food pyramid
and traffic light approach for diet may be used to highlight
healthy eating patterns, with special emphasis on fixed portion
size, decreased junk food consumption, avoiding television
viewing while eating, and increased fruit consumption.

Physical Activity
Periods of inactivity should be reduced and increased physical
activity should be planned. Screen time (television, computer,
and mobile devices) should be restricted to less than 1 hour
a day. Increased routine activities (e.g., household chores,
walking to school) should be encouraged. A minimum of 30
minutes daily of enjoyable activity like dancing, sports, and
running should be ensured, avoiding weight bearing exercises
and over regimented schedules.

Specific Management

524

Specific treatment is needed for hypothyroidism, GH
deficiency, and Cushing syndrome. Mild elevations of TSH
do not need treatment. Obese children with Prader-Willi
Syndrome and growth failure may benefit from GH therapy.
Octreotide is effective in hypothalamic obesity, leptin in leptin
deficiency.

ch-107.indd 524

Treatment of Complications
Complications should be treated early to avoid long-term
adverse effects. Metformin is indicated for IR, T2DM, NAFLD
and PCOS; statins for persistent dyslipidemia. Treatment of
NAFLD includes metformin, vitamin E, and pioglitazone. Girls
with PCOS benefit from lifestyle modification, metformin, oral
contraceptives, and antiandrogens. Medroxy­
progesterone
acetate is beneficial in children with obesity hypoventilation
syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure is needed in
obstructive sleep apnea.

Medical Treatment for Obesity
Drugs used in the past have faced problems due to adverse
effects. Orlistat is the only drug approved for use in children with
obesity. It inhibits gastric lipase, resulting in reduced absorption
of fat, with modest weight loss. Major side effects include
abdominal pain, bloating, steatorrhea, and anal leakage of oil.
It has to be combined with fat soluble vitamins. Newer agents
in the pipeline include MC4 receptor modulators, glucagon-like
peptide 1 analogs, and endocannabinoid agonists.

Surgical Management
Bariatric surgery should be considered only in severe obesity
when other measures have failed, only after achievement of
final height, due to potential adverse growth effects. It is a major
surgical undertaking, to be viewed as potentially life-saving,
not just a cosmetic procedure. Patients need to adhere to strict
dietary restriction for life. In children, laparoscopic adjustable
banding is the recommended procedure; malabsorptive
procedures and gastric sleeve should not be done.

Clinical Pearl
• Medical and surgical treatment of childhood obesity should be
considered only in severe cases associated with complications.

HOW TO PREVENT CHILDHOOD OBESITY?
Given the difficulties in management, prevention is the desirable
goal. Though this is very challenging, the recent plateauing of
childhood obesity rates in several states in the United States
and some European countries is encouraging. This is proof
that awareness and societal changes can reduce this important
public health problem. Key measures include prevention and
treatment of adult obesity (due to intergenerational effects
of obesity), early identification and treatment of gestational
diabetes mellitus, and increased consumption of healthy
food. Exclusive breastfeeding should be done till 6 months, on
a demand basis, not according to a schedule. Infants should
be given the freedom to decide the frequency and amount of
feeds. Saturated fats (e.g., full fat milk) should be restricted after
age 2 years. Changes in dietary habits—eating food with family
at regular times, avoiding snacking, avoiding television while
eating, and fixed portion size, should be advised. The child is
encouraged to play (moderate physical activity) for at least 60
minutes daily. The overall screen time should be limited to

11/21/2016 2:12:33 PM

Chapter 107: Childhood Obesity
less than 2 hours a day. Television should be removed from
children’s bedrooms, and avoided in children under 2 years.

An Approach to Hyperglycemia
Aspi J Irani

INTRODUCTION
Normoglycemia is defined as fasting venous plasma glucose
between 70 and 100 mg/dL and a 2-hour postprandial or post
glucose value less than 140 mg/dL. Corresponding values
more than 126 and 200 mg/dL are used to define diabetes
mellitus (DM).
Hyperglycemia is encountered by the pediatrician/
neonatologist in five different settings:
1. Child or adolescent with typical symptoms of DM
2. Hyperglycemia as an incidental pick up (or during
screening) in an obese (but asymptomatic) adolescent
3. Neonate or infant (below 6 months) with symptoms of
hyperglycemia
4. Hyperglycemia during an acute illness in a child/
adolescent [stress hyperglycemia (SH)]
5. Hyperglycemia in a sick neonate in the neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU).
Hyperglycemia is due to a disturbed balance between
insulin on one hand and the counter-regulatory hormones
(adrenaline, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone) on the
other. While insulin promotes utilization or storage of glucose
entering the body, and promotes protein and fat anabolism,
the counter-regulatory hormones promote catabolism of
protein and fat and favor movement of glucose into the blood
stream from storage sites (chiefly liver, muscle, and kidneys) by
promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
Adverse effects of hyperglycemia include:
• Osmotic diuresis with dehydration and electrolyte
derangements once the renal threshold has been exceeded
• Hyperosmolarity (An 18 mg/dL rise in blood glucose raises
osmolarity by 1 mOsm/L) and osmotic shifts with brain cell
dehydration and risk of intracranial bleeds
• Glucose overload in insulin independent endothelial
cells (hepatic, immune, and nerve cells) with generation
of oxygen free radicals and resultant mitochondrial
dysfunction and enhanced apoptosis
• Impaired leukocyte phagocytic function predisposing to
infections and leading to delayed clearing of infections

ch-108.indd 526

•

•

In the NICU, an increased risk of severe retinopathy of
prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) broncho­
pulmonary dysplasia, septicemia, with longer duration of
NICU stay, and a higher mortality
In the long-term, persistent hyperglycemia can affect many
organs by glycosylation of proteins/collagen.

CHILD OR ADOLESCENT WITH TYPICAL
SYMPTOMS OF DIABETES MELLITUS
Polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss, and weakness
(with or without a history of ants around the urine and of vaginal
candidiasis) are typical symptoms due to hyper­glycemia.
If ketosis has set in, there would be anorexia, abdominal
pain, vomiting, abdominal distension, dehydration, acidotic
breathing with a peculiar “acetone” odor to the breath, and
drowsiness. Shock and coma may occur but are uncommon.
In the presence of typical symptoms of hyperglycemia
with ketosis, single random blood glucose over 200 mg/dL is
sufficient to clinch the diagnosis of DM. In this situation, an
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not only unnecessary but
can also be dangerous.
In an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic child, a fasting
blood glucose (done after 8 h of no calorie intake) of 126 mg/
dL or above with 2-hour postprandial value 200 mg/dL or more
on two occasions is diagnostic of DM. The OGTT should never
be done if DM can be diagnosed from the fasting, random, or
postprandial blood glucose values. A fasting blood glucose
between 100 and 125 mg/dL is referred to as “impaired fasting
glucose” while a post glucose reading between 140 and 199
mg/dL is labeled as “impaired glucose tolerance”; both these
are considered as prediabetic states.
Having made the diagnosis of DM, the next step is to
ascertain the type of DM. Type 1, is, by far, the commonest
variety encountered in childhood. Presence of detectable
pancreatic autoantibodies (common antibodies tested are to
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65, insulin, islet cell, and
tyrosine phosphatase) with low C-peptide values in a child

11/21/2016 2:14:05 PM

Chapter 108: An Approach to Hyperglycemia
with acute onset of symptoms of DM confirms the diagnosis
of T1DM. One should look for associated autoimmune
disorders, both endocrine (thyroid dysfunction, adrenal
disease, and hypoparathyroidism) and nonendocrine (celiac
disease, alopecia areata, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis,
mucocutaneous candidiasis, and pernicious anemia).
Type 2 DM (T2DM) is becoming commoner because of
the increasing incidence of adolescent obesity. It must be
suspected in any obese adolescent with a family history of
T2DM, especially if there are associated features indicating
insulin resistance [acanthosis nigricans, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, evidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS)]. In such cases, absence of antibodies typical of T1DM
with high C-peptide levels would confirm T2DM. It must be
emphasized that diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation
does not exclude T2DM; 6–33% of T2DM present in DKA.
A nonobese adolescent with mild diabetes and a family
history of DM in three generations, possibly has one of the
varieties of maturity onset diabetes of the young. If there is
optic atrophy or associated deafness or persistent polyuria
despite good control of DM (pointing to an associated diabetes
insipidus), the diagnosis would be “Wolfram syndrome”. In a
child with recurrent abdominal pain, the development of DM
should initiate a search for pancreatic calculi (fibrocalculus
pancreatic diabetes). Diabetes associated with sensorineural
deafness and thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia is
referred to as “Roger syndrome”. The clinician needs to look
for any syndromic features in a child with DM as Mongolism,
Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi, and Klinefelter syndromes
(besides many others) can be associated with DM with a higher
frequency than in the general population. Adolescents with
thalassemia major tend to develop DM in the second decade
of life due to iron loading in the pancreas (causing insulin
deficiency) and in the liver (leading to insulin resistance).
Algorithm 1 outlines the approach to a pediatric patient with
typical symptoms of hyperglycemia with or without ketonuria.
Insulin is the mainstay of treatment for T1DM and also for
initial treatment in T2DM with acute presentation. Metformin
is the only approved oral drug for pediatric T2DM. All varieties
of DM also require lifestyle change, meal planning, regular
planned physical activity, counseling, and attention to
comorbidities. All patients with DM must receive intensive and
ongoing education in diabetes self-management.

HYPERGLYCEMIA DETECTED ON SCREENING
IN AN OBESE ASYMPTOMATIC ADOLESCENT
Children above the age of 10 years who have attained puberty
must be screened for DM if they have any two of the following
risk factors
• Obesity
• Family history of DM in a 1st or 2nd degree relative
• Evidences of insulin resistance(hypertension, acanthosis
nigricans, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and PCOS)
• In utero exposure to DM.
In these patients, a fasting and preferably also a 2-hour
post glucose (1.75 g/kg to a maximum of 75 g) blood glucose
should be checked once in every 2 years or whenever there are
symptoms suggestive of hyperglycemia. Algorithm 2 outlines

metabolism in these cases.

Clinical Pearl
• Obese adolescents with evidence of insulin resistance or
a family history of diabetes mellitus (DM) or with in-utero
exposure to DM must have a fasting blood glucose test every
2 years to screen for DM.

Early detection and treatment (lifestyle change and
metformin) is very important as microvascular and
macrovascular complications occur earlier and are more
severe in adolescents than in adults with T2DM. Screening
is very important as T2DM may remain asymptomatic and
escape detection for a prolonged period of time. Some patients
with T2DM may test positive for autoantibodies characteristic
of T1DM; they are classified as having “latent autoimmune
diabetes” and are likely to need insulin in the near future
(usually in next 3 years).

inherited chromosome. Three novel heterozygous mutations
in the KCNJ11 gene (G53S, G53R, and I182V) have been
shown to result in TNDM in some patients who do not have
abnormalities of chromosome 6q24. Some mutations in the
ABCC8 gene and the HNF1b gene are also associated with
this transient variety of DM.
Although these patients grow out of their insulin
dependence by 18 months of age (usually earlier), 50–60%
will have a recurrence of DM later in life (average age 14 years
with a range of 4–25 years). On recurrence, most would require
insulin though the dose is small or the requirement may be
intermittent; some may be controlled with sulfonylureas. A few
may display hyperglycemia only during intercurrent illnesses.
Thus, what is referred to as TNDM may actually be a
permanent defect in b-cell insulin release with variable
expression at different stages of development.

Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus

DM, diabetes mellitus; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus.

NEONATE/INFANT (BELOW 6 MONTHS) WITH
SYMPTOMS OF HYPERGLYCEMIA
The neonate/infant with diabetic hyperglycemia would
present with irritability, polyuria, weight loss, failure to thrive,
and dehydration with or without acidotic breathing and
occasionally with candidiasis in the genital region. Important
differentials include diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis,
diluted feeds, and hyperthyroidism. In patients presenting
with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, if there is lack
of improvement with appropriate treatment of DKA, the
possibility of certain inborn errors of metabolism must be kept
in mind: these include methylmalonic acidemia, propionic
acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, biotinidase deficiency, and
cobolamine metabolism defects. If the diagnosis of DM
is confirmed (as above), the two broad possibilities are:
(1) transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) and (2)
permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM).

Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus

528

The presentation is soon after birth (median age 3 days). Most
cases are below the 3rd percentile in weight (average weight
2 kg). Associated congenital anomalies reported include
macroglossia in 20% and umbilical hernia in 10%. They show
remarkable improvement with insulin therapy. This is a selflimited condition and resolves by 18 months (median age
12 weeks).
Abnormalities of chromosome 6q24 with overexpression
of paternally expressed genes are seen in 65% of cases.
The defect may be paternal uniparental isodisomy of
chromosome 6, paternally inherited duplications within the
long arm of chromosome 6, or loss of methylation within the
TNDM critical region of chromosome 6 on the paternally

ch-108.indd 528

Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is a genetically
heterogeneous disorder with at least nine different genetic
etiologies reported till date. These genetic defects may be
associated with either deranged b-cell function or reduced
pancreatic mass with or without syndromic features. Thyroid,
pancreas, liver, heart, brain, kidney, and skeletal abnormalities
may be associated.
Approximately 95% of patients with monogenic causes
of neonatal DM present within the first 6 months of life, with
around 3% diagnosed between 6 and 12 months of age.

Clinical Pearl
• All patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus before 6 months
of age, as well as those patients diagnosed between 6 and12
months of age, who have no detectable pancreatic auto­
antibodies, should undergo molecular genetic testing.

There are five genes known to be associated with
nonsyndromic PNDM. The first two listed below have
important therapeutic significance as they can be managed on
sulfonylurea group of drugs and are not insulin requiring:
1. Heterogeneous activating mutations of the KCNJ11 gene
which encodes one of the two protein subunits (Kir6.2) of
the adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ (KATP) channel in
the b-cells account for 30% of cases of PNDM. Low birth
weight (LBW) is a consistent phenotypic marker but after
insulin treatment, there is marked catch up growth followed
by normal growth. Twenty percent have developmental
delay and muscle weakness and 5% have epilepsy in
association with neonatal diabetes (the so called DEND
syndrome)
2. Mutation in the ABCC8 gene which encodes the other
protein subunit (the SUR1 subunit) of the KATP channel
constitutes another genetic etiology and is the cause in 19%
of all PNDM
3. Mutations of the gene encoding insulin (INS gene) accounts
for a further 20% of cases of PNDM: these babies are born
at full term, have a better average birth weight (2.86 kg) and
are diagnosed later (13 weeks as against 5–7 weeks) than
those with defects in ABCC8 or KCJN11

11/21/2016 2:14:05 PM

Chapter 108: An Approach to Hyperglycemia
4. Homozygous inactivating mutations of the gene encoding
glucokinase must be suspected in PNDM with history
of consanguinity especially if both parents have mild
hyperglycemia. These cases present at birth with severe
LBW. As a first test in any LBW baby born with neonatal
diabetes, the parents blood glucose should be checked
5. Rarely, neonatal diabetes may be due to inactivating
mutations of the PDX1 (IPF1) gene. This is associated with
pancreatic agenesis or hypoplasia and hence with exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency. These patients have the severest
insulin deficiency and present early with significant LBW.
Carrier parents would have mild adult onset diabetes.

Clinical Pearl
• Neonatal diabetes mellitus due to mutations of the KCNJ11
and ABCC8 genes do not require insulin therapy; these can be
controlled with sulfonylurea group of drugs.

There are at least four syndromes associated with neonatal
DM which can be suspected in a given case from their
associated features:
1. GLIS3 gene mutation has PNDM due to pancreatic
hypoplasia with severe congenital hypothyroidism,
glaucoma, hepatic fibrosis, and cystic renal disease
2. PTF1α gene mutation of severe PNDM due to pancreatic
agenesis or hypoplasia has associated exocrine pancreatic
cephaly, and
insufficiency, dysmorphic facies, micro­
impaired cerebellar development with severe develop­
mental delay and occasionally, gall bladder agenesis
3. FOXP3 gene mutation (the “IPEX syndrome”) is a X-linked
disorder of autoimmunity that occurs in males who
present with neonatal diabetes, immune dysregulation,
autoimmune thyroid disease, intractable diarrhea,
exfoliative dermatitis, eczematous skin rash, and very
high serum immunoglobulin E. Most die of overwhelming
sepsis in the first months or years of life
4. Mutations of the EIF2AK3 gene lead to persistent
neonatal diabetes and either multiple epiphyseal
or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (Wolcott-Rallison
syndrome). Transmission is autosomal recessive. Some
may have progressive renal failure from glomerulo­
nephritis. One-fourth patients have exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency. They may also have recurrent hepatitis and
mental retardation.
There is a case report of maternal enteroviral infection at
the end of the first trimester leading to pancreatic hypoplasia
with presence of GAD and anti-insulin antibodies and neonatal
diabetes mellitus (NDM) presenting at or soon after birth.
It is often difficult to clinically distinguish TNDM from
PNDM, however, patients with PNDM are usually born
closer to term, have a higher birth weight, length and head
circumference, a later age of presentation, and a higher
insulin requirement. Presence of associated anomalies or
syndromic features may be helpful in differential diagnosis.
On follow-up, declining insulin requirement over weeks/
months with return to normoglycemia off therapy clinches
the diagnosis of TNDM.

ch-108.indd 529

Management of
Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus
Molecular genetic studies must be done in all infants
presenting below 6–12 months of age with diabetes. A search
for the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations should be urgently
undertaken as it has important therapeutic implications. An
ultrasound or preferably computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging scan of the abdomen should be obtained
to look for hypoplastic/absent pancreas. Appropriate tests
to detect associated hypothyroidism, cerebellar hypoplasia,
renal cysts, skeletal defects, agenesis of the gall bladder, or
deranged liver function should be undertaken in selected
cases. Screening of the parents for undiagnosed diabetes and
gene mutations is essential.
At presentation, if the infant is dehydrated with or without
ketoacidosis, intravenous fluids and insulin infusion would be
required as per the DKA protocol.
For long-term management, insulin injections (coupled
with a high calorie intake) are crucial to achieve normal
catch up growth and sustained weight gain. Rapid and short
acting insulin preparations should be avoided as the risk of
hypoglycemia is high (these are used only in babies started on
the “insulin pump”). It is best to prescribe two or three injections
of neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin subcutaneously each
day. The average dose would be 0.5–1.0 units/kg/day but this
must be periodically adjusted on basis of home blood glucose
monitoring results. Glargine insulin with its flat pharmacokinetic
profile might prove useful but is not licensed for use in this age
group. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (the “insulin
pump”) has been successfully tried in neonates with 30% of
the total dose given as a continuous basal infusion and 70% as
boluses divided equally between the total daily feeds.
In the first 6 months, the infant needs to be exclusively
breastfed at frequent intervals. If the mother is not in a position
to breastfeed, a milk formula may be offered. Frequent small
feeds are preferred in order to prevent swings in blood glucose.
When weaning foods are introduced, one should prefer foods
with a low glycemic index.
Regular home monitoring of blood glucose (checked 2–3
hours after a feed and immediately before a feed) should be
done and the recommended target blood glucose is between
100 mg and 200 mg/dL. It should be remembered that
prevention of hypoglycemia is an important priority in the first
3 years of life as it can have a permanent detrimental effect on
brain development.
Patients with NDM owing to KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations
can be successfully shifted to oral treatment with sulfonylureas
after initial stabilization with insulin. Glibenclamide appears
to be more effective than other sulfonylureas. Doses required
are usually higher than those used in adult patients with T2DM
(0.33 mg/kg/day for a 60 kg adult). The median dose in NDM is
0.45 mg/kg/day (range 0.1–1.5 mg/kg/day). Glycemic control
tends to improve with time, and the dose of sulfonylurea can
subsequently be decreased. Transient diarrhea and yellow
or grayish staining of deciduous teeth may occur, but other
adverse effects are rare.
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is required for
those with exocrine deficiency.

STRESS HYPERGLYCEMIA
Stress hyperglycemia refers to transiently elevated blood
glucose during an illness. The American Diabetic Association
has defined SH as any blood glucose more than 140 mg/dL
in a hospitalized nondiabetic patient. About 3.8% of children
presenting to the emergency department would have SH. Fever
more than 39.5°C, febrile seizures, traumatic brain injuries,
burns, sepsis, pancreatitis, and dehydration are the most
common acute situations associated with SH. The more severe
the illness, the greater is the likelihood of SH. A glycosylated
hemoglobin test would help in excluding the possibility of
hitherto undetected DM as the cause for hyperglycemia.
Stress hyperglycemia is caused by changes in glucose
metabolism, due to increase in counter-regulatory hormones,
leading to increased glycogenolysis, neoglucogenesis,
and development of insulin resistance both central (in the
liver) and peripheral (in muscle and fat). Proinflammatory
cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α [increased free fatty acid
(FFA) causing insulin resistance], interleukin (IL)‑1 (increased
gluconeogenesis), and IL-6 (increased glycogenolysis) also
contribute. Interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β
may also be involved. Intensive care unit (ICU) procedures
(particularly, mechanical ventilation), use of vasoactive agents,
prolonged immobilization, and nutritional practices in the ICU
further add to SH.
Modest hyperglycemia (<180 mg/dL) may be beneficial
(an adaptive response) by providing additional energy to
meet the increased metabolic demand of the brain, red
blood cells, and other cells; but if prolonged or severe, it has
been associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Both
the peak and the duration of hyperglycemia affect prognosis.
Stress hyperglycemia is more dangerous than hyperglycemia
without stress. In the former, the glucose transporters are overexpressed. Hence, more glucose enters the cells. This leads to
altered cell metabolism with increased reactive oxygen species
generation which causes altered mitochondrial function and
apoptosis. Stress hyperglycemia also impairs macrophage and
neutrophil function and complement activity.
Does stress hyperglycemia need to be treated and if so,
what is the best approach? There is no conclusive answer to
this question in adult and in pediatric studies conducted till
date. Two major trials addressing this issue are underway.
Trials concluded so far in the pediatric population using
insulin infusion to achieve tight blood glucose control have
given conflicting results. The duration of hospital stay may be
reduced with tight blood glucose control but the incidence
of hypoglycemia also goes up significantly. Thus, it may be
reasonable to try and maintain the blood glucose at levels of
140–180 mg/dL rather than aggressively controlling blood
glucose to lower levels. When insulin is used, it should be given
as a continuous infusion of regular human insulin with close
monitoring of blood glucose.

Clinical Pearl
530

ch-108.indd 530

• Stress hyperglycemia needs treatment with insulin infusion,
only if blood glucose is more than 180 mg/dL with glycosuria;
the target blood glucose should be 140–180 mg/dL, with all
efforts to prevent hypoglycemia.

Are children with SH more likely to develop DM in
future? Studies have reported an incidence of later diabetes
ranging from 0–33% in patients with a history of SH. In one
detailed study only 2.1% developed DM during 42 months of
follow-up; all of these had human leukocyte antigen types or
autoimmune markers known to be associated with T1DM, or
an abnormal OGTT on recovery from the acute illness. Those
with hyperglycemia during relatively minor illnesses have a
higher risk than those who develop SH during major illnesses.

HYPERGLYCEMIA IN
NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
Hyperglycemia in neonates, defined historically as a whole
blood glucose more than 125 mg/dL or serum glucose more
than 150 mg/dL, is common in critically ill neonates and in the
very low birth weight (VLBW) premature babies. Its occurrence
is inversely related to gestational age and birth weight and
directly related to the severity of any accompanying illnesses.

Pathophysiology and Causes
Lower and delayed insulin production in response to glucose
load is reported in the VLBW neonates, due to smaller beta
cell mass, preferential release of inactive proinsulin instead
of insulin, and lack of enteral feeding which eliminates the
boosting effect of gut incretins on insulin release. Glucose
utilization is further limited because of their small mass
of insulin dependent tissues: fat and muscle. Sick preterm
babies have increased insulin resistance due to increased
inflammatory markers, cytokines, and catecholamines.
Hyperglycemia could result from:
• Excess/rapid exogenous glucose delivery (iatrogenic)
• Stress (serious illness especially septicemia, respiratory
distress, or NEC; pain; surgical procedures)
• Therapy with certain drugs (corticosteroids, theophylline,
caffeine, phenytoin, or use of diazoxide in mother)
• Cerebral pathology with large damaged areas having
reduced metabolism and thus, decreased glucose utilization
(trauma, hypoxemic-ischemic lesions, hemorrhage,
meningitis, and encephalitis)
• Total parenteral nutrition can also affect blood glucose
status.
Intralipid infusion raises blood glucose as it stimulates
gluconeogenesis by supplying FFA and glycerol. Intralipid
supplies nearly three times more energy than glucose, hence
when a neonate is started on intralipid, there is no need to
give glucose at higher than physiological rate of 6–8 mg/
kg/min. Aminoacids also support gluconeogenesis but to
a lesser extent than intralipid. High amounts of aminoacid
infusion, however, may help by increasing insulin secretion
and glucose utilization.

Management
•

Anticipate and monitor for hyperglycemia: all susceptible
neonates must have blood glucose screening. Heel prick or
fingers prick blood glucose at bedside though inaccurate
is very useful in screening for hyperglycemia. The results
must be confirmed with laboratory estimation of plasma

glucose. The continuous glucose monitoring system
measures interstitial tissue glucose level every 5 minutes;
it has been successfully used in the NICU. Urine should be
checked for glycosuria as this is likely to be accompanied
with changes in serum osmolarity
Any underlying cause of hyperglycemia must be sought
out and addressed first (such as sepsis, TNDM and PNDM,
specific illnesses, or hyperglycemia inducing drugs)
Consider limited reduction of glucose infusion rate: When
hyperglycemia is detected, the first intervention is to
reduce the glucose infusion rate to 6–12 mg/kg/min; stable
preterms need a glucose supply of 6 mg/kg/min, an ill
preterm would require more glucose. A lower rate would
not meet the basic glucose requirement. A higher rate
than 12 mg/kg/min would be detrimental as the maximal
glucose oxidative capacity is exceeded and beyond this
level, conversion to fat occurs. Further, high glucose rates
increase carbon dioxide production which is undesirable
in respiratory compromised infants. Dextrose solutions
with concentration less than 5% should never be used as
these would be hypo-osmolar and can cause hemolysis and
hyperkalemia. Total parenteral nutrition should be started
as soon as possible in LBW babies; certain aminoacids can
stimulate insulin release
Insulin therapy: it should be started when the blood
glucose exceeds 250 mg/dL or when there is glycosuria
despite above measures. Blood glucose should be
brought down slowly to avoid rapid fluid shifts. Insulin
is given as an infusion at a rate of 0.02–0.1 units/kg/h. At
the outset, it is important to run off about 50 mL of the
insulin infusion to saturate binding sites on the tubing.

The infusion should be changed every 24 hours. Large
inter-subject variation in response is common, thus blood
glucose must be checked every 30–60 minutes initially till
it has stabilized and thereafter every 4 hours for titration
of insulin dose. Some studies have shown insulin to be
safe and beneficial and others report risks and problems.
A threefold increased lactate concentration and significant
acidosis is reported when insulin is given with high glucose
infusion rate. Careful monitoring is required to minimize
risks of hypokalemia and hypoglycemia which are known
complications of insulin therapy. Algorithm 3 outlines the
approach to a neonate with symptoms of hyperglycemia or

Gynecomastia in Children
Raghupathy Palany

INTRODUCTION
Gynecomastia is a benign enlargement of the male breast due
to proliferation of the glandular component. The condition
may occur in one or both breasts and begins as a small firm
lump beneath the nipple, which may be tender and later
extend concentrically. If the breast enlargement is soft in
consistency, then it indicates fat deposition which is termed as
pseudogynecomastia (lipomastia), and there is no glandular
proliferation.
Physiologic gynecomastia is seen in newborns and in
pubescent males. In newborns, breast development in both
sexes may be associated with milk flow (galactorrhea). This
condition usually lasts for a couple of weeks, but in rare cases
may last until the child is 2 years old.
Pubertal gynecomastia is quite common and occurs in
nearly two-thirds of pubertal boys. It appears around 12 years,
and regresses in around 18–24 months. Obese boys appear to be
more affected and may improve when adipose tissue becomes
less on weight reduction. Gynecomastia is stated to be caused by
relatively increased aromatization or higher than normal adult
values of estrogen- testosterone ratio in this period, or through
episodic elevations of estrogen, although many studies failed to
document these changes conclusively. Increased sensitivity of
the breast tissue to estrogens may be operative.
Pathologic causes of gynecomastia should be sought
carefully as they require to be treated appropriately.
The histology of the male and female breast tissue being
similar, exposure to estrogen in both sexes induces ductal
epithelial hyperplasia, ductal elongation and branching,
proliferation of the periductal fibroblasts, and an increase in
vascularity.
Increased estrogen production and/or action can occur at
the testicular level or at the periphery and is characterized as
follows:
• From peripheral conversion: this can be due to increased
substrate or increased activity of aromatase, as in chronic

ch-109.indd 532

liver disease, malnutrition, hyperthyroidism, adrenal
tumors, and familial gynecomastia
• From the testes: this can be due to testicular tumors or to
ectopic production of human chorionic gonadotropin, as
is reported with carcinoma of lung, kidney, gastro­intestinal
tract, and extragonadal germ cell tumors.
Pathologic gynecomastia can be caused by:
• Increase in the production and/or action of estrogen
{{ Increased aromatization of androgens to estrogens
{{ Increased androgenic precursors [dehydroepiandro­
sterone (DHEA) and androstenedione]
{{ Increased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)—
binds testosterone with higher affinity than estrogen
favoring greater peripheral estrogen action
{{ Estrogen receptor agonism.
• Decrease in the production and/or action of testosterone
{{ Decreased production
–– Primary hypogonadism—Klinefelter syndrome
■■ Congenital anorchia
■■ Enzymatic defect in testosterone biosynthesis
■■ Infection (viral orchitis)
■■ Infiltrative disorders
■■ Testicular trauma
–– Secondary hypogonadism—hypothalamic or
pituitary disorder
■■ Low testicular production of testosterone/
estriol—adrenal androgens are aromatized—
estrogen/androgen imbalance
■■ Kallmann syndrome with anosmia
{{ Androgen insensitivity syndrome
{{ Increased SHBG—binds testosterone with greater
affinity than estrogen favoring greater peripheral
estrogen action
• Androgen receptor antagonism
• Idiopathic
• Drug use (Box 2).

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
•
•

ch-109.indd 533

History of mumps, testicular trauma, or drug use should be
obtained
Thorough examination of the size and consistency of the
breasts and to differentiate from lipomastia is essential

•
•

Examination of the testes, with attention to size and
consistency, as well as nodules or asymmetry
Dimpling of the skin, nipple retraction and discharge,
and axillary lymphadenopathy are suggestive of breast
carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS
Patients with physiologic, asymptomatic, and pubertal
gynecomastia do not require further evaluation and should be
re-evaluated in 6 months. Further evaluation is necessary in
the following situations:
• Breast size greater than 5 cm (macromastia)
• A lump that is tender, of recent onset, progressive, or of
unknown duration
• Signs of malignancy (e.g., hard or fixed lymph nodes or
positive lymph node findings).

Laboratory Tests
•
•
•

Serum chemistry panel
Free or total testosterone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol,
and DHEA levels
Thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels.

Imaging Studies
•
•
•

Mammography, if one or more features of breast cancer
are apparent upon clinical examination, followed by fine
needle aspiration or breast biopsy as appropriate
Testicular ultrasonography: indicated if the serum estradiol
level is elevated and the clinical examination findings
suggest the possibility of a testicular neoplasm
Breast ultrasonography (though the positive predictive
value of imaging in males is low).

Clinical Pearl
• The diagnosis of pathologic gynecomastia must be made
only after ruling out lipomastia and physiological breast
enlargement.

MANAGEMENT
•
•

No treatment is required for physiologic gynecomastia
Pubertal gynecomastia resolves spontaneously within
several weeks to 2 years in most patients; therapy must be
considered if remission has not occurred in 2 years
• Breasts larger than 4 cm in diameter may not regress
completely
• Identifying and managing an underlying primary disorder
often alleviates breast enlargement
• For patients with idiopathic gynecomastia or with residual
gynecomastia after treatment of the primary cause, medical
or surgical treatment may be considered
• In pathologic causes of gynecomastia, medical therapies
should be tried early after onset.
Medical therapy involves the following drugs, but
controlled studies are lacking:

be as safe and successful.

PATIENT EDUCATION
Patients with physiologic gynecomastia should be reassured
regarding the benign nature of their condition, and informed
that most cases spontaneously resolve.

PROGNOSIS

534

In approximately 90% of cases, pubertal gynecomastia
resolves within a period of months to several years. However,
macromastia seldom resolves completely and often requires
surgery.
Gynecomastia that occurs secondary to an underlying,
treatable cause (e.g., drug-induced gynecomastia) usually
responds to treatment or removal of the primary cause. Men
with Klinefelter syndrome have a 10–20-fold increased risk for
breast cancer.

Precocious Puberty
Puthezhath SN Menon, Madhava Vijayakumar

INTRODUCTION
Precocious puberty (PP) is characterized by the appearance
of markers of pubertal development at an age earlier than the
usual pattern. Tremendous advances in the understanding
of the pathophysiology have resulted in paradigm shifts in
the current management. Precocious puberty represents a
significant diagnostic, psychosocial, and therapeutic challenge
for the pediatrician. Most cases in girls are an exaggeration
of the normal physiological process, whereas in boys half the
cases are pathological. In general, younger the age, more is the
chance of detecting an organic pathology. Early diagnosis and
treatment is pivotal since, if left untreated, PP leads to eventual
short stature and also causes psychological stress in the
affected children. Some of the underlying causes (e.g., tumors)
may even be fatal.

PHYSIOLOGY OF PUBERTY
The pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary
gland to secrete the gonadotropins—luteinizing hormone
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Luteinizing
hormone stimulates the Leydig cells of testes which secrete
testosterone, initiating the pubertal changes in boys.
Follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates spermatogenesis
by the seminiferous tubules. Luteinizing hormone and FSH
stimulate the ovaries to secrete estrogen which initiates the
onset of puberty in girls and leads to the development of
secondary sexual characters as well.
The secretion of GnRH is regulated by the “hypothalamic
pulse generator” constituted by the neurons in the arcuate
nucleus of the hypothalamus, which expresses several
neurotransmitters, including kisspeptin and neurokinin B. The
gonadal sex steroids exert a negative feedback regulation of
gonadotropin secretion through the hypothalamic neurons.
Adrenarche is the increased production of the adrenal
androgens—dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate

(DHEAS), associated with the development of the zona
reticularis of the adrenal cortex and is independent of gonadal
maturation.

NORMAL PUBERTY
Testicular enlargement from 3 to 4 mL is the first sign of puberty
in boys, followed by enlargement of penis, pigmentation of
scrotum, and growth of pubic and axillary hair. The various
stages of puberty are graded as Tanner stages 1–5 (sexual
maturity rating; Table 1). Peak growth velocity occurs in the
later stages of puberty (Table 2). Onset of puberty is closely
related to skeletal maturation.
Breast development is the first sign of puberty in girls,
followed by growth acceleration, pubic hair development,
and menarche (Tables 3 and 4). Onset of breast development
usually occurs at a bone age of 10 years and menarche at
12.5 years, irrespective of the chronological age. Peak growth
velocity occurs in the initial 2 years, before menarche.

DEFINITION OF PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY
Puberty is considered precocious when signs of puberty appear
before the age of 9 years in boys and 8 years in girls. The onset of
menarche before 9.5 years is also termed as precocious.

TYPES OF PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY
•

•

Central precocious puberty (CPP) or gonadotropindependent precocious puberty is caused by early release of
gonadotropins (FSH and LH) from the pituitary, which in
turn stimulate the testes to produce testosterone, or ovaries to
produce estrogen. In CPP, the sequence of pubertal changes
mimics normal puberty, but begins at an earlier age
Peripheral precocious puberty (PPP) or gonadotropinindependent precocious puberty is caused by secretion
of sex steroids from any organ which is outside the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and independent of

puberty does not follow the normal pubertal pattern.
Premature thelarche is the early development of breasts,
without other signs of puberty such as rapid linear growth or

pubic hair development. Premature adrenarche is the early
development of pubic hair without other pubertal changes.
Both are normal physiologic variants.

CAUSES OF PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY
Box 1 lists the common causes of precocious puberty.
Idiopathic precocity is rare in boys. Organic causes account for
a majority of cases in younger girls, whereas idiopathic causes
are more common after the age of 6 years.

APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS
History
Note the age at onset of the first signs of puberty and its progress
over time. The growth spurt or peak growth velocity is important,
as the acceleration of linear growth results in tall stature initially,
but eventually the affected children become short adults since
fusion of bones occur early. Onset of puberty in early childhood
(below age 6 years) is highly suggestive of organic central nervous
system (CNS) pathology, particularly hypothalamic hamartoma,

A detailed family history of early puberty and consanguinity is
helpful to diagnose constitutional forms, familial male-limited
precocious puberty (FMPP or testotoxicosis) and congenital
adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Carefully elicit the history of drugs
or creams consumed/applied by the child or parents/other
family members, including illicit drug use (anabolic steroids,
estrogen creams, androgen, and phytoestrogens). Possibility of
sexual abuse, foreign body or vaginal infection must be probed
in girls with isolated vaginal bleeding. Ask for any previous height
measurements (pediatrician/school).

Physical Examination
The height, weight, span, and body proportions should be
measured carefully and plotted on growth charts. It is important
to measure the height of father and mother to calculate the
midparental height, which is plotted on the right side of the
growth chart. Compare with previous height measurements to
assess growth velocity. Note the development of acne, pubic,
axillary and facial hair, as well as appearance of hair in unusual
areas. Look for voice change and muscle development. Skin
should be checked for texture (hypothyroidism), macules
(neurocutaneous syndromes), neurofibromas, and caféau-lait spots (neurocutaneous disorders and MAS; Fig. 2).
It is important to look for skeletal deformities (e.g., MAS).
Hyperpigmentation of mucosa and skin is a common feature
of CAH. Check for other clinical stigmata of hypothyroidism,
e.g., weight gain with decreased linear growth, puffiness,
lethargy, constipation, or coarse skin. Precocious puberty
is characterized by rapid growth rate, deepening of voice
(in boys), and enlargement of genitalia. However, PP associated
with hypothyroidism is characterized by growth faltering and
absence of pubarche.
Pubertal development should be assessed according
to Tanner’s stages. In boys, assess testicular volume using
an orchidometer and measure the stretched penile length
(from the base of the shaft of the penis to the tip, excluding

537

SECTION 13: Endocrinology
may be high in children with 11β-hydroxylase deficiency or
adrenal tumor. Abdominal examination may reveal adrenal or
ovarian mass as well as enlarged uterus. Firm hepatomegaly
may be a manifestation of hCG-secreting tumors such as
hepatoblastoma.
If breast development is the only clinical feature, without
growth acceleration and pubic hair development, the condition
is labeled as premature thelarche. Premature adrenarche is
the likely diagnosis if signs of virilization (pubic hair, axillary
hair, facial hair, or acne) appear without breast development,
growth acceleration, or advanced bone age. These children
should be followed up regularly, to look for later development
of growth spurt and other pubertal changes. A fluctuating
course is suggestive of intermittent estrogen production by
ovarian cysts. Discordant puberty (e.g., vaginal bleeding within
short duration of thelarche) indicates withdrawal bleeding
following removal of the source of estrogen production as with
ovarian cyst, hypothyroidism, or MAS.

premature thelarche and the large café-au-lait pigmented macule in
the axilla

the foreskin). In children with CPP (e.g., hypothalamic
hamartoma), penile enlargement is associated with increase
in testicular volume (>4 mL, or diameter >2.5 cm). In PPP
(e.g., CAH), testicular volume remains prepubertal (<4 mL).
In testotoxicosis and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)secreting tumors, testes are modestly and symmetrically
enlarged (3–4 mL). Asymmetrical or unilateral enlargement of
testis is seen in Leydig cell tumors or adrenal rests.

Clinical Pearl
• Measuring testicular volume carefully narrows down
the possibilities, thus reducing the cost and number of
investigations and the time taken for establishing the etiology.

538

In girls, evaluation of the breast as well as genital
examination in an appropriate position is important. Vaginal
mucosa should be examined in good light for signs of estrogen
effect (e.g., pale pink color instead of glistening red prepubertal
mucosa). Presence of vaginal secretions and menstruation
should be noted. Clitoral size should be evaluated. Vaginal
bleeding without breast development may indicate sexual
abuse: marks of injury should be looked for. Virilization
without signs of estrogen effect indicates androgens from the
adrenal or rarely, the ovary or an androgen-secreting tumor.
Rapid virilization may suggest androgen-secreting tumors of
adrenal gland or ovary. Breasts should be carefully examined
for nodules and galactorrhea.
In a boy with true precocious puberty, an organic cause is
far more likely, unlike in girls older than 6 years, where most
investigations are likely to be normal. All young children with
precocious puberty should be evaluated for an underlying CNS
disorder. This should include the signs of raised intracranial
pressure and examination of optic fundi. Blood pressure

Investigations
Investigations should be directed to confirm PP and find out
the etiology. Bone age should be assessed accurately, using
a Greulich-Pyle or Tanner-Whitehouse atlas, and pelvic
ultrasound done in girls by an ultrasonologist experienced in
pediatrics. Precocious puberty is associated with advanced
bone age except in hypothyroidism. If the bone age
advancement is appropriate for the height age, it is likely that
the precocity is benign, probably a normal variant that needs
only careful follow-up and no treatment. An advanced bone
age, coupled with pubertal changes on pelvic ultrasound,
suggests the need for an endocrine evaluation.
Hormonal investigations are recommended in very young
children with advancing puberty—if more than one sign of
puberty is present; if a new sign of puberty appears during
follow-up; if the growth rate is accelerated; or if bone age is
advancing rapidly. Serum estradiol in girls, and testosterone in
boys in early morning samples confirm the diagnosis. Serum
levels of estradiol less than 10 pg/mL and testosterone less
than 25 ng/dL rule out CPP. However interpretation of the
results, especially for serum estradiol, might be difficult as the
sensitivity of most available assays is much above these levels.
Basal level of serum LH in a pooled or midnight sample
(since the secretion of LH is pulsatile) is the best screening
test to diagnose CPP. Luteinizing hormone is more useful than
FSH: levels less than 0.1 IU/L by a very sensitive assay indicate
prepubertal state, while those above 0.6 IU/L suggest pubertal
levels. In premature adrenarche, gonadotropin levels are
prepubertal, while in PPP, they are suppressed.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test or
GnRH agonist analog stimulation test is required if baseline
gonadotropin levels are inconclusive.
The GnRH stimulation test is performed by collecting
3–7 blood samples at 30-minute intervals after injection of
intravenous or subcutaneous GnRH (2.5 µg/kg; maximum
100 µg). Normal prepubertal children show a peak increment
of 3–4 IU/L of LH and 2–3 IU/L of FSH. Pubertal LH levels

CHAPTER 110: Precocious Puberty
(>6 IU/L) and LH to FSH ratio greater than 0.9 are diagnostic
of CPP. A predominant FSH response is seen in premature
thelarche. However, this test is difficult to do, due to the limited
availability of GnRH and the higher number of samples, which
makes it more invasive and expensive.

Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone
Agonist Analog Test
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analog test is,
therefore, the preferred test now. A single sample is taken
60 minutes after a subcutaneous injection of leuprolide acetate
10–20 µg/kg (maximum of 500 µg) or of triptorelin 0.1 mg. A
stimulated LH level of 6 IU/L or more is consistent with CPP.

Clinical Pearl
• Luteinizing hormone level in a pooled serum sample is the best
screening test for central precocious puberty; gonadotropinreleasing hormone stimulation test is confirmatory.

Other Hormones
Estimation of serum total testosterone is useful in girls to
differentiate between premature adrenarche and virilization,
and in polycystic ovarian syndrome. Serum free testosterone
is not a useful test. Pubertal levels of DHEAS characterize
premature adrenarche, while greatly elevated level of DHEAS
is seen in virilizing adrenal tumors.
Elevated unstimulated plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone
levels are seen in CAH. If the levels are inconclusive, an
adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test is performed.
Testosterone levels are very high in tumors. Pubertal
testosterone levels with suppressed gonadotropins are seen
in FMPP (testotoxicosis). Human chorionic gonadotropin
and often a-fetoprotein are elevated in patients with hCGsecreting tumors. In girls, increased estrogen with suppressed
gonadotropins is seen in conditions causing autonomous
secretion of estrogen such as functional ovarian cysts, ovarian
tumor, or MAS.
Serum thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels
should be checked if the bone age is delayed, especially
with slow height velocity. Serum prolactin levels should be
estimated in the presence of galactorrhea.

Imaging
Plain X-rays of the Skull
They may show sellar enlargement, calcification, and evidence
of raised intracranial pressure, but are almost always of little
utility. A skeletal survey should be done if clinical features
suggest fibrous dysplasia (MAS).

Pelvic Ultrasound
It helps in girls to arrive at a diagnosis by visualizing the uterus,
adrenals, and ovaries. Ovarian volume more than 1–2 mL,
with multiple cysts (>6 cysts and greater than 4 mm diameter)
is characteristic of a peripubertal state. The pubertal ovarian

volume is usually above 3 mL. Large ovarian cysts are often
seen in girls with hypothyroidism: these regress with thyroxine
replacement, and do not require surgery. In the uterus, the
earliest feature of estrogenization is a change in the shape from
prepubertal tubular shape (diameters of fundus and cervix are
equal) to pubertal pear shape (diameter of the fundus is more
than that of cervix). Endometrial thickness of 6–8 mm indicates
menarche is imminent.

Abdominal Ultrasound
It is useful in diagnosing adrenal tumors and ultrasound
of testes is used to diagnose testicular tumors. Computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
abdomen may be confirmatory in adrenal tumors.

Neuroimaging
High resolution MRI of hypothalamus and pituitary helps
to detect lesions such as hypothalamic hamartoma, glioma,
astrocytoma, and structural mal­formations like septo-optic
dysplasia. Magnetic resonance imaging should be done in all
boys, and in girls below 6 years, since the chance of finding
an organic cause is high. In girls above 6 years, since most will
be idiopathic, MRI should be individualized, e.g., it should be
done if the pubertal progression is very rapid or there is other
evidence of a CNS pathology. Further hormonal evaluation
of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis may be indicated if an
abnormality is detected.

Clinical Pearl
• An organic etiology is more likely in a young boy with
central precocious puberty, unlike an older girl where most
investigations are likely to be normal.

Algorithm 1 summarizes the approach to the diagnosis of
PP in girls where as algorithm 2 details the approach to the
diagnosis of PP in boys.

MANAGEMENT
Untreated PP leads to early pubertal maturation with
advancement of bone age and early epiphyseal fusion, leading
to tall stature in childhood, but short stature in adulthood,
and psychological problems. Treatment is aimed at arresting
the progression of puberty, identifying and managing the
underlying cause, increasing the prospects for better adult
height, and providing psychosocial support to affected children
and their families.
Tumors of the brain, gonads, adrenals, or ectopic sites
may require surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Ovarian
cysts more than 3 cm in diameter, which are persistent or
have a solid component, may need exploration and excision.
Smaller cysts are monitored by frequent estrogen estimations
and ultrasounds. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is managed
with hydrocortisone (15–20 mg/m2) and fludrocortisone.
Hypothyroidism is managed with thyroxine replacement.

CHAPTER 110: Precocious Puberty
In CPP, long-acting GnRH analogs are the mainstay of
treatment. They decrease the episodic release of GnRH due
to their continued high levels, causing desensitization of
gonadotropin-producing cells of the pituitary. They slow down
rapid skeletal maturation and linear growth, which remain
unaffected by other forms of therapy. Depot preparations
are preferred. These include leuprolide (3.75 and 11.25 mg),
triptorelin (3.75 and 11.25 mg), and goserelin (3.6 mg).
Treatment should be continued till the child reaches the
normal pubertal age (10–11 years). The effectiveness of therapy
is monitored by clinical evaluation of puberty, growth, and
hormone evaluation. The sex steroids should revert to normal
prepubertal levels for age. An effective dose is one where the
gonadotropin response to exogenous GnRH is obliterated. This
can be done by testing serum LH 60 minutes after the depot
injection. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog treatment
in girls with CPP has no long-term deleterious effects on
reproductive function or bone mineralization.
In patients with autonomous gonadal steroid production
such as MAS and FMPP, therapy is aimed at reducing sex
steroid production or its effects, thereby arresting acceleration
of growth and progression of puberty. Medroxyprogesterone
acetate and cyproterone acetate interfere with sex steroid
synthesis, but have no beneficial effect on final height outcome.
Aromatase inhibitors prevent testosterone conversion to
estrogens or block the receptors for testosterone and dihydro­
testosterone. Medical management of peripheral precocity

Persistent Hypoglycemia in
Newborns and Infants
Ganesh S Jevalikar

INTRODUCTION
The neonatal period marks the transition of continuous
supply of glucose from maternal circulation in intrauterine
life to interrupted availability of glucose in extrauterine life.
Hypoglycemia is a significant threat to the developing brain and
if inadequately treated, can lead to permanent brain damage.
This chapter discusses causes and approach to treatment of
persistent hypoglycemia in infants. Transient hypoglycemia is
more common, particularly in preterm, low birth weight, and
sick newborns and is discussed in the later section.

DEFINITION OF HYPOGLYCEMIA
A single cut-off to define normal plasma glucose is not
possible as specific brain responses to low glucose depend
on several factors like the duration of low glucose and the
availability of alternative fuels. The Whipple’s triad used to
define hypoglycemia in older children and adults cannot be
used in infants, due to the inability to communicate symptoms
and the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. Recognition of
hypoglycemia may therefore require confirmation by repeated
measurements of plasma glucose.
Due to the possible risks of hypoglycemia to the developing
brain, evaluation and management is recom­mended in infants
whose plasma glucose concentrations are documented by
laboratory quality assays to be below the normal threshold
for neurogenic responses (<60 mg/dL). This is especially
applicable beyond the first 2-3 hours of life. Plasma glucose
values are 10–15% higher than whole blood values and
appropriate corrections should be made before interpreting
the values.

and the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. , Recognition of

measurements of plasma glucose.
Due to possible risks of hypoglycemia to the developing
brain evaluation and management is recommended in infants
whose plasma glucose concentrations are documented by
laboratory quality assays to be below the normal threshold
for neurogenic responses (<60 mg/dL). This is especially
applicable beyond first 2-3 hours of life. Plasma glucose values
are 10–15% higher than whole blood values and appropriate
corrections should be made before interpreting the values.
Low values obtained on capillary testing should be
confirmed by laboratory assessment, since capillary assess­
ments are not accurate enough (particularly in the low range)
to diagnose hypoglycemia. Samples for blood glucose must be
analyzed immediately as delayed processing decreases values.

Clinical Pearls
• Diagnosis of hypoglycemia should be based on a level in a
venous sample, not capillary glucose by finger stick
• Plasma glucose values are 10–15% higher than whole blood
• Delay in processing of sample causes drop in measured glucose.

GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS IN
FETUS AND NEWBORN
Fetal blood glucose remains around 54 mg/dL over most
of gestation, especially after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In the
first 1–2 hours after birth, blood glucose drops to as low as
30 mg/dL. This stimulates glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis,
and ketogenesis, mediated by hormonal changes [suppression
of insulin and release of counter-regulatory hormones:
catecholamines, glucagon, and growth hormone (GH)],
changes in hormone receptors, and expression of key enzymes
of glucose production, which increase the blood glucose to

11/21/2016 2:27:52 PM

Chapter 111: Persistent Hypoglycemia in Newborns and Infants
greater than 45 mg/dL by 12 hours of birth. Initiation of feeding
after birth maintains ongoing supply of energy substrates.
Breastfed newborns have lower blood glucose and higher
ketone concentrations (principal alternative fuel for brain)
compared to formula-fed newborns.

GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS
IN OLDER CHILDREN
Understanding glucose homeostasis in the fed and fasting
states is important to understand the causes of hypoglycemia.
Although the mechanisms of control are analogous to adults,
children have lesser tolerance to fasting due to lesser glycogen
stores and lesser muscle mass. In the fed state, insulin promotes
glucose utilization by insulin-dependent tissues (utilization by
brain is insulin independent) and promotes glycogenesis and
lipogenesis, the storage forms of energy. In the fasting state, a
drop in blood glucose is prevented by suppression of insulin
and release of counter-regulatory hormones (catecholamines,
glucagon, GH, and corticosteroids) which mediate glyco­
genolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis. Lipolysis generates
alternative fuels through fatty acid oxidation and formation
of ketone bodies. These mechanisms come into play at
different intervals of fasting, with glycogenolysis being the
immediate mechanism and gluconeogenesis the principal
mechanism after depletion of glycogen stores. Insulin has an
inhibitory effect on fatty acid breakdown and ketogenesis.
Figure 1 illustrates glucose homeostasis in the fasting state in
a simplified way.
Interruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms
maintaining blood glucose levels causes hypoglycemia.
Glucose entry into β-cells through glucose transporter 2
initiates the process of insulin secretion (Fig. 2). Upon entry,
glucose is metabolized to glucose-6-phosphate by glucokinase
which is further metabolized, leading to generation of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Increase in intracellular ATP/

GLUT2, glucose transporter 2; GK, glucokinase; GDH, glutamate dehydro­
genase; SUR, sulfonylurea receptor α-KG , α-ketoglutarate; ATP, adenosine
triphosphate; ADP,adenosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate.

showing major steps in insulin secretion

adenosine diphosphate ratio closes ATP sensitive potassium
(KATP) channels [which consist of inward rectifying K+ channel
Kir 6.2, surrounded by sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)]. This
causes depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium
channels. Increased intracellular calcium causes exocytosis of
insulin vesicles. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) catalyzes
glutamate oxidation leading to formation of ATP and further
cascade of reactions leading to insulin release. Leucine is an
allosteric activator of GDH action.

TRANSIENT HYPOGLYCEMIA OF NEWBORN
As noted above, blood glucose less than 45 mg/dL may be
observed in 5–15% healthy term newborns. Some newborns
are at risk for transient hypoglycemia (Box 1). In some of these
conditions, hypoglycemia may be recurrent or persistent
over first few weeks (e.g., in small for gestational age babies),
therefore needing evaluation as persistent hypoglycemia.

PERSISTENT HYPOGLYCEMIA IN
NEWBORNS, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN
Persistent hypoglycemia can result from conditions (Box 2)
which interfere in normal glucose homeostasis (Fig. 1)
Box 1: Causes of transient hypoglycemia in neonatal period

Dashed arrows indicate actions mediated by insulin which are inhibited in a

Congenital Hyperinsulinism

544

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) [previously called
nesidioblastosis, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
of infancy (PHHI), or leucine sensitive hypoglycemia] is the
most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates
and infants. Insulin secretion is inappropriate (rather than

ch-111.indd 544

excessive) at the time of hypoglycemia (normally with low
blood glucose, insulin gets totally suppressed). It poses more
risk to the brain than other causes, as unsuppressed insulin
also prevents ketogenesis (alternative fuel for the brain). In
spite of significant recent advances in molecular genetics, in
nearly 40–50% of cases of CHI, precise genetic mechanisms
remain unknown. Mutations causing CHI generally increase
intracellular ATP, leading to persistent closure of KATP
channels and uninhibited insulin release. Most commonly,
these are mutations in subunits of KATP channels (SUR1
receptor coded by ABCC8 gene and Kir6.2 channel coded by
KCNJ gene). Autosomal recessive (AR) mutations present
earlier, are associated with macrosomia, and are more
commonly unresponsive to diazoxide. Autosomal dominant
(AD) mutations are generally milder and diazoxide responsive.
Other types include activating mutations of glucokinase, GDH
(characterized by hyperammonemia and leucine sensitivity,
macrosomia is unusual), short chain hydroxylacyl-coenzyme
A (CoA) dehydrogenase, SLC16A1 (characterized by exerciseinduced hyperinsulinism), and recently described mutations
in several newer genes (Box 2)
Histologically, focal and diffuse types are seen. Focal
forms are due to paternally inherited recessive mutations of
KATP channel and somatic loss of heterozygosity in maternal
chromosome 11, and can be completely cured by selective
pancreatectomy.
Clinically, CHI can be divided into diazoxide responsive
and unresponsive. Genetic studies can be helpful in predicting
response to treatment and need for surgical management, and
must be attempted in all cases presenting with CHI.

• Congenital hyperinsulinism is the most common cause of
persistent neonatal hypoglycemia
• Insulin secretion is inappropriate rather than excessive
• Genetic analysis may be helpful in deciding the line of
treatment and must be attempted in all cases.

Hormone Deficiencies
Growth hormone (GH) and/or adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) deficiency can present as neonatal hypoglycemia. It is
more common with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies
than with isolated hormone deficiencies. Microphallus,
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and midline defects are
clinical clues to these deficiencies. Low serum free thyroxine
can be suggestive. The diagnosis is suspected if GH and/
or cortisol levels are low in a hypoglycemic blood sample,
keeping in mind that persistent or recurrent hypoglycemia
per se can impair GH and cortisol responses. Primary adrenal
insufficiency can cause hypoglycemia, e.g., neonates with
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but usually other clinical
features dominate (genital ambiguity, salt wasting crisis).
Hypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies responds to
appropriate hormone replacement.

Chapter 111: Persistent Hypoglycemia in Newborns and Infants

Disorders of Carbohydrate Metabolism
Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) are AR enzyme deficiencies
of glycogen metabolism. Ketotic hypoglycemia is commonly
seen in types I, III, VI, and IX GSD. Although they can present
in the newborn period, more often they manifest when the
interval between feeding and the duration of fasting increases.
Failure to thrive, short stature, hepatomegaly, and doll-like
facies are clinical clues. In some, skeletal or cardiac muscle
involvement may be present but is usually asymptomatic in
childhood. Renal tubular dysfunction can be seen in type
1 GSD, and hypophosphatemic rickets in Fanconi-Bickel
syndrome. Biochemical evaluation shows elevated lactate,
uric acid, triglycerides, and hepatic transaminases (serum
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic
transaminase). Lactate and uric acid are usually elevated in
type 1 GSD. Glycemic response to glucagon tends to be absent
or poor. Definitive diagnosis can be established by genetic
analysis or enzyme studies in liver biopsy specimen. Treatment
of hypoglycemia usually consists of frequent carbohydrate
feeding and supplementation with uncooked cornstarch.
Defects in gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy­
kinase deficiency, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency)
present with fasting hypoglycemia, high lactate and alanine
levels, and fatty infiltration of liver and other organs. Hereditary
fructose intolerance presents on exposure to fructose containing
food (sucrose, fruits, and juices), with hypoglycemia, vomiting,
failure to thrive, hepatomegaly and renal tubular dysfunction.
Classic galactosemia [galactose-1-phosphate uridyl­
transferase (GALT) deficiency] presents in neonates and
infants with hypoglycemia, cholestatic jaundice, vomiting, and
Escherichia coli sepsis. Urine tests positive for non‑glucose
reducing substances and diagnosis is confirmed by GALT assay.

Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders
Hereditary or acquired defects of fatty acid oxidation
impair ketogenesis and produce nonketotic hypoglycemia,
liver dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and encephalopathy.
Manifestations can be of variable severity, including risk
of sudden death. Episodes of decompensation are usually
triggered by fasting or intercurrent illnesses. Treatment
includes avoidance of fasting, frequent feeding, high
carbohydrate (up to 70% of energy intake)-low fat diet, use of
cornstarch, and carnitine supplementation (not useful in long
chain hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase).

Aminoacidopathies
Aminoacidopathies (Box 2) present with ketotic hypo­
glycemia, repeated vomiting, and developmental delay.
Seizures, encephalopathy, and hepatomegaly can be present.
Hyperammonemia is seen in organic acid disorders. Diagnosis
depends on finding of specific organic acids in urine and
analysis of liver biopsy or cultured fibroblasts.

Insulinoma
Islet cell adenoma (insulinoma) is a rare cause of hypoglycemia
in children. Diagnosis is based on magnetic resonance imaging

ch-111.indd 545

or functional scanning of pancreas. If present, it should prompt
evaluation for features of MEN1 in the child.

Accelerated Hypoglycemia
(Ketotic Hypoglycemia)
This condition usually presents at 1.5–5 years of age, typically
as early morning lethargy and difficulty in getting up in
the morning, associated with ketonemia/ketonuria. These
children have relatively lesser concentrations of alanine and
less tolerance to fasting. Spontaneous improvement is seen
after 8–9 years of age.

Symptoms of Hypoglycemia
Symptoms of hypoglycemia in neonates (Box 3) can be nonspecific and caused by other etiologies like sepsis, asphyxia,
and electrolyte disturbances.
Symptoms are usually divided into those resulting
from autonomic system activation and those resulting
from neuro­glucopenia (Table 1). However, in newborns, in
poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus, and in those with
autonomic dysfunction, autonomic symptoms may be absent.
The threshold blood glucose value at which symptoms appear
can be variable.

CLINICAL EVALUATION
Careful history and examination is the first step in diagnosis.
Clues to diagnosis on history and examination are listed in
Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

Diagnostic Algorithm

546

Evaluation of the hypoglycemic infant starts with an accurate
blood glucose, obtained by laboratory analysis. Plasma blood
glucose less than 50 mg/dL during infancy, and less than
60 mg/dL beyond infancy is consistent with the diagnosis,
especially when associated with symptoms. At all ages, cases
with persistent hypoglycemia must be referred urgently to
centers having expertise in managing CHI. Prolonged fruitless
attempts at making diagnosis can lead to irreversible brain
damage. Diagnostic sampling at the time of hypoglycemia is
most important; this critical sample taken before administering
medication, of blood and urine (passed after the hypoglycemic

episode) needs to be analyzed for tests mentioned in Table 4.
In any sick neonate/child, a sample of blood should be taken
and stored, so further tests can be decided depending on
further clues and detecting the cause of the seizure/coma
(e.g., hypoglycemia/hypocalcemia/hyponatremia/other).
Alongside diagnosis, hypoglycemia has to be managed,
especially if neuroglucopenic symptoms (like seizures) are
present. High IV glucose requirement (>8 mg/kg/min) is
a strong pointer in favor of CHI. Criteria for diagnosis of
hyperinsulinism are mentioned in Box 4.
Growth hormone levels greater than 20 ng/mL in neonates
(>10 ng/mL in children) and cortisol greater than 20 µg/dL
in the critical sample rule out GH and cortisol deficiency,
respectively. Lower values in the hypoglycemic sample need
confirmation by definitive testing unless hypopituitarism/
adrenal insufficiency is obvious clinically. High insulin with
low C-peptide indicates exogenous insulin administration.
A commonly used algorithm (Algorithm 1) for diagnosis of
persistent hypoglycemia is given below.

†Not

A fasting challenge may be occasionally required for
diagnosis, but should be done only at experienced centers
under careful supervision of pediatric endocrinologists. It
may be particularly risky for infants with fatty acid oxidation
disorders.

MANAGEMENT
Acute symptomatic hypoglycemia should be treated with
a 2 mL/kg IV 10% dextrose bolus, followed by continuous
infusion of 10% dextrose at the rate of 6–8 mg/kg/min. Frequent
monitoring of capillary glucose is required initially to judge
the required concentration to maintain blood glucose greater
than 60 mg/dL. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring can
be a useful tool. Efforts to start and maintain enteral feeds can
then be done, and if successful, IV glucose tapered gradually.
Breastfeeding should be encouraged, as it favors ketogenesis.
Frequent feeding, including at night, is important, and may
require tube feeding. Raw cornstarch (1–2 g/kg/day) can be
added to feeds for children older than 1 year of age. It can be
given at bedtime to prevent morning hypoglycemia. Glucose
polymers (polyjoule, maxijoule, etc.) can be useful for infants
as a source of complex carbohydrates, but are not easily
available in India. Higher concentrations should be avoided as
they increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.
Inability to start or maintain enteral feeds/persistent
hypoglycemia is managed with increasing the concentration of
IV glucose. Glucose infusion rates greater than 8 mg/kg/min
should prompt consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist
to rule out CHI (such infants often require rates
>10–15 mg/kg/min). Glucose boluses reflexly stimulate insulin
secretion and should be avoided after the initial bolus. A patent
IV access must always be ensured and higher concentrations of
glucose (>10–12%) given through central vascular access.

Specific Treatment for
Congenital Hyperinsulinism
After documenting high glucose requirement, a trial of
diazoxide is given for infants with proven or suspected CHI,
usually started at 7–10 mg/kg/day in three divided doses

ch-111.indd 547

orally, and increased up to 20 mg/kg/day. A trial of at least
5–7 days is needed before labeling a patient diazoxide
unresponsive. Common side effects include fluid retention,
tachycardia, and hypertrichosis (reversible on stopping).
Diazoxide is not freely available and costs up to Rs 50–60
per tablet. Diazoxide unresponsive hypoglycemia can be
medically managed with injection octreotide or glucagon.
Nifedipine and chlorothiazide may help as add-on oral agents
but should not be used alone (Table 5).
Diazoxide unresponsive patients need mutation analysis
and 18F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission
tomography/positron emission tomography-computed tomo­
graphy (18F DOPA PET/PET-CT) to differentiate focal and
diffuse forms of disease. Selective pancreatectomy can be
curative in cases with the focal form. The diffuse form can be
managed with long-term octreotide if response to treatment
is present and resources permit. Use of long acting octreotide
preparations and sirolimus has been recently described
in some cases. Other cases are managed with near-total
pancreatectomy which is associated with development of
diabetes mellitus in the postoperative period.

Specific Treatment of
Other Causes of Persistent Hypoglycemia
General principles of management of persistent hypo­glycemia
are described in box 5.
Growth hormone/cortisol deficiencies are treated with
specific hormone replacement. Galactosemia and fructose
intolerance require avoidance of milk or lactose-containing
substances/fruits, honey, and sucrose-containing foods,
respectively. Frequent feeds, nocturnal cornstarch, and
avoidance of fasting are the treatment for many of the
metabolic diseases. Carnitine supplementation can be useful
in some fatty acid oxidation (FAO) disorders.

PROGNOSIS
Persistent hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinism are a major risk
for neurologic damage, resulting in sequelae like psychomotor
retardation and epilepsy. All children should have periodic
neurodevelopmental evaluation. Early referral to experienced
centers, aggressive treatment of hypoglycemia, and timely
decision of surgery in diazoxide unresponsive cases can help
prevent brain damage in hyperinsulinism. Surgical treatment
for diffuse hyperinsulinism results in diabetes mellitus.

Approach to a Child with
Disorder of Sex Development
Vijaya Sarathi

INTRODUCTION
Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are defined as
congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal,
gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. A 2006 Consensus
Conference suggested that the potentially pejorative terms
“pseudohermaphroditism” and “intersex” be replaced by the
diagnostic category “disorders of sex development”. The most
common presentation of DSDs is with abnormalities of the
external genitalia (ambiguous genitalia), usually detected at
birth. Abnormalities of external genitalia sufficient to prompt
evaluation (Box 1) occur in approximately 1 in 4,500 live births.
Early evaluation of a child with ambiguous genitalia is of
utmost importance due to the association with life-threatening
disorders like congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and early
assignment of appropriate sex. Some DSDs are not characterized
by genital ambiguity (Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome).
Some others will have apparently normal genitalia at birth, and
get diagnosed at an older age. Presentation in older individuals
may include genital ambiguity unrecognized at birth, inguinal
hernia, delayed/incomplete puberty, primary amenorrhea,

virilisation in an apparent female, breast development or gross
hematuria in an apparent male.

Clinical Pearl
• Isolated penile hypospadias or isolated micropenis does not
merit evaluation for disorders of sex development.

CAUSES AND CLASSIFICATION
Ambiguous genitalia usually results due to virilization of a
female fetus (XX DSD), undervirilization of a male fetus (XY
DSD), or mixed sex chromosome disorders. An example of
classification of DSDs is shown in table 1.
Virilization of a female fetus occurs due to androgen
exposure during some critical periods of development. Fetal
androgen exposure between 8 weeks and 12 weeks of fetal
life leads to urogenital sinus (single opening at introitus)
and labioscrotal fusion. Androgen exposure after 12 weeks
of gestation will lead to isolated clitoromegaly. Significant
undervirilization of a male fetus occurs due to low or absent fetal
androgen exposure during the critical developmental period.
Low or absent androgen after this critical developmental
period will cause isolated micropenis.

EVALUATION OF A CHILD
WITH AMBIGUOUS GENITALIA
Evaluation of an infant or a child with ambiguous genitalia is
challenging. Most virilized 46XX infants have CAH; however,
only 50% of undervirilized 46XY patients receive a definitive
diagnosis.

History
A detailed history and thorough physical examination have
a pivotal role in the evaluation of a child with ambiguous
genitalia. History should include family history of DSDs,

members, consanguinity, maternal drug (androgen, alcohol

history of virilization during pregnancy. In an infant, history
of vomiting, dehydration, inadequate weight gain, and dark
pigmentation of oral mucosa and/or genital mucosa should be
asked for. In a newborn boy with marked pigmentation of the
scrotum, CAH should be ruled out. In an older child, history

ch-112.indd 550

should also focus on postnatal progression of virilization
(increasing clitoral size, premature pubarche, or precocious
puberty), pubertal events (virilization of an apparent girl at
puberty, gynecomastia, delayed or absent puberty), gross or
cyclical hematuria in a boy, and response to hormonal therapy,
especially to testosterone in boys. Certain key pointers in
history and physical examination provide useful clues towards
the etiological diagnosis and are listed in table 2.

Chapter 112: Approach to a Child with Disorder of Sex Development

Physical Examination

Urethral Opening

Physical examination should include measurement of blood
pressure with appropriate sized cuff, an accurate and objective
assessment of genitalia, and evaluation for any dysmorphic
features. While 21-hydroxylase deficiency is characterized by
hypotension with dyselectrolytemia and hypoglycemia due
to adrenal insufficiency, presence of hypertension raises the
possibility of 11β-hydroxylase deficiency.

It may be present anywhere from the tip of the phallus to the
perineum and should be assessed by careful examination of
the ventral aspect of the phallus for grooves. A single opening
at the base of the phallus may be either an incompletely fused
penile urethra (hypospadias) or a virilized urogenital sinus
(e.g., internal connection between the vagina and urethra).
Accordingly, these findings must be confirmed either by
cystoscopy/vaginoscopy or radiographically, because the
physical examination can be misleading.

Dysmorphic Features
A thorough evaluation should be done in all children with
ambiguous genitalia, so that if it is part of a syndrome, the
diagnosis can be made.

Clinical Pearl
• All infants with ambiguous genitalia and nonpalpable gonads
should be considered to have congenital adrenal hyperplasia
and closely monitored until proven otherwise.

Gonads
The scrotum, labia majora, and inguinal area should be
carefully palpated to identify the presence, position, size, and
consistency of the gonads. Palpable gonads in the scrotum
or inguinal canal are almost always testes or rarely ovotestes;
hence, suggest 46XY DSD or ovotesticular DSD. Pigmentation
and rugae of the labioscrotal folds and presence of epididymis
should also be evaluated. Non-palpable gonads suggest either
XX DSD (most likely CAH) or XY DSD with gonadal dysgenesis
or cryptorchidism.

Phallic Length
Penile/clitoral length is measured from the pubic ramus to the
tip of the glans (excluding any excess foreskin) after stretching
the penis to the point of increased resistance. The ruler should
be pressed down against the ramus to completely depress the
suprapubic fat pad. Normal values for stretched penile length
and clitoris are available and vary among different ethnic
populations. In general, a penile length of less than 2.5 cm
suggests micropenis whereas a clitoral length of greater than or
equal to 1 cm suggests clitoromegaly in term infants.

Clinical Pearl
• Normal preterm female infants may appear to have clitoro­
megaly since they have larger clitoral breadth compared to
body size.

Anogenital Ratio
In apparently female external genitalia, mild degree of
virilization in the form of posterior labial fusion can be
evaluated with measurement of anogenital ratio. This is the
ratio of the distance from the anus to the posterior fourchette,
and the distance from the anus to the base of the clitoris. A ratio
of greater than 0.5 suggests virilization with some posterior
labial fusion.

Prader Stages
Degree of genital ambiguity does not differentiate between
46XX DSD and 46XY DSD. It merely provides information
about the extent of abnormality once the karyotype is known.
Prader staging is commonly used to describe the degree of
virilization in 46 XX DSDs. Different Prader stages are depicted
in figure 1. Stage 1 is otherwise normal looking female genitalia
with isolated phallic enlargement, stage 2 is further phallic
enlargement and posterior labial fusion without urogenital
sinus, stage 3 is significant phallic enlargement with almost
complete fusion of labioscrotal folds and urogenital sinus
with single perineal opening, stage 4 is phallus with penile
appearance with complete labioscrotal fusion and urogenital
sinus opening at the base or ventral surface of the phallus, and
stage 5 is phallus with the appearance of well-developed penis
with completely fused labioscrotal folds and urogenital sinus
opening at the body or glans of the phallus.

Laboratory Evaluation
First line laboratory testing, especially in newborns, includes
karyotyping with SRY detection (even when prenatal karyotype
is available), imaging (abdomino-pelvic ultrasound), and
measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone,
gonadotropins, anti-Mullerian hormone, and electrolytes. The
results of these investigations are generally available within 48
hours and will be sufficient for making a working diagnosis.
To minimize psychological distress during evaluation, the
patient/family should be informed exactly what will be done
and why. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is always a possibility
in an infant with ambiguous genitalia. Hence, throughout the
evaluation period, careful monitoring of the infant for weight,
vitals, and blood chemistry (blood glucose, sodium and
potassium) should be carried out to start early treatment if the
findings suggest CAH.

Karyotype
Karyotype is performed, usually using peripheral leukocytes.
Because of the possibility of mosaicism, it is suggested that at

least 200 cells should be examined. The results of the karyotype
permit classification of the infant into one of three diagnostic
categories (XX DSD, XY DSD, and mixed sex chromosome
DSD) that guide further evaluation.

hypoplasia, or testosterone biosynthetic defect. The most
common testosterone biosynthetic defect, 17β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) deficiency, is diagnosed by
decreased testosterone to androstenedione ratio.

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization

Imaging

Fluorescence in situ hybridization using Y specific (SRY) and
X specific probes will provide results within hours compared
to conventional karyotype which takes days to provide results.

Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis by an
ultrasonologist experienced in neonatal work is important to
determine the presence of gonads, a uterus, and/or a vagina.
Retrograde urethrogram may be necessary, although most
surgeons find direct visualization by cystoscopy/vaginoscopy
under general anesthesia to be the single best method
of assessing the urethral and vaginal anatomy. In some
complicated cases (particularly those infants with elements
of male and female gonads/internal reproductive structures),
laparoscopic visualization may ultimately be required to
completely delineate reproductive anatomy and this allows for
simultaneous gonadal biopsy for histologic/genetic evaluation.
Urinary steroid profile by gas chromatography/mass
spectro­metry is useful when rarer forms of CAH are suspected.
Specific genetic analyses may be helpful in reaching the exact
diagnosis.
Given the spectrum of findings and diagnoses, no specific
single evaluation protocol can be used. Evaluation of each
case must be individualized. In this chapter, author provides
a practical decision-making algorithm based on karyotype
of the child (Algorithm 1). A simplified practical algorithm
to approach a child with apparently male genitalia and
undescended testes is depicted in algorithm 2. A detailed
algorithmic approach to a child with XX DSD and XY DSD are
depicted in algorithm 3 and algorithm 4 respectively.

Adrenal Steroids
Measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone should be done
promptly in all infants presenting with genital ambiguity
or marked genital pigmentation, to exclude CAH due to
21-hydroxylase deficiency. It should be measured on or
after day 3–4 of life since maternal steroid may result in
spuriously high values if determined during day 1–2. Levels
of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) should be interpreted
using gestational age matched reference ranges to avoid
spurious diagnosis of CAH. It should also be noted that stress
responses like sepsis may falsely elevate 17-OHP levels.
Other tests for adrenal evaluation include serum cortisol,
plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone, plasma renin activity,
17-hydroxypregnenolone, 11-desoxycortisol, and dehydro­
epiandrosterone.

Clinical Pearls
• Measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) should be
avoided during first 2 days of life
• Levels of 17-OHP may be falsely elevated in infants with sepsis
and prematurity and should be interpreted with caution.

Gonadal Steroids
Gonadal steroid assessment during the prepubertal period
requires a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation
test. However, in infants between 1 month and 6 months,
transient activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
may provide an opportunity for gonadal steroid assessment
without hCG stimulation.

Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Stimulation Test

552

There are many protocols for hCG stimulation test. The most
widely used one is the short hCG stimulation test. Human
chorionic gonadotropin (500–1,500 IU/day) is administered
intramuscularly on 3 consecutive days; 24 hours after the last
dose, blood sample is collected and analyzed for testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione.
Normal or high testosterone levels suggest androgen
insensitivity or 5α-reductase deficiency. An elevated
testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ratio (T/DHT) suggests
5α-reductase deficiency. However, a recent study has suggested
that the use of T/DHT ratio has poor sensitivity for the diagnosis
of 5α-reductase deficiency. Hence, molecular studies are
essential for appropriate diagnosis of these conditions. Low
testosterone values suggest gonadal dysgenesis, Leydig cell

ch-112.indd 552

MANAGEMENT
The primary aim in managing an infant with DSD should be to
achieve a diagnosis, sex assignment, and management plan as
quickly as possible. This requires involvement of an experienced
multidisciplinary team. Ideally, the team includes pediatric
endocrinologist, pediatric surgeon, child psychologist/
psychiatrist, gynecologist, geneticist, neonatologist, medical
social worker, and medical ethics specialist.

Newborn Gender Assignment
Infants with 46XY complete androgen insensitivity syndrome
(CAIS) and 46XX CAH should be reared as females, whereas for
those with 5α-reductase deficiency or 17β-HSD3 deficiency, a
male assignment should be strongly considered. In other cases,
factors that influence gender assignment include diagnosis,
genital appearance, surgical options, need for lifelong
replacement therapy, potential for fertility, views of the family,
and, sometimes, circumstances relating to cultural practices.
Feminizing genital surgery involves external genitalia
reconstruction and vaginal exteriorization, with early separation
of the vagina and urethra. Clitoral reduction is considered with
severe virilization (Prader III–V) and preferably, performed in
conjunction with common urogenital sinus repair. Procedures

should emphasize functional cosmetic appearance and
be designed to preserve erectile function and enervation.
Vaginoplasty should be performed in the teenage years.
Masculinizing genital surgery involves more surgical procedures
and urologic difficulties than feminizing genitoplasty. Standard
surgical repair involving hypospadias includes chordee
correction, urethral reconstruction, and judicious testosterone
supplementation. If needed, adult-sized testicular prostheses

should be inserted after sufficient pubertal scrotal development.
For XY DSD individuals (except for CAIS) who have been
assigned female gender, gonadectomy should be performed
before puberty. Patients with GBY-positive gonadal dysgenesis
and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) with intraabdominal testis, and Turner syndrome with Y chromosome
have high risk of germ cell malignancy and should undergo
gonadectomy before puberty.
Hypogonadism is common in patients with dysgenetic
gonads, defects in sex-steroid biosynthesis, and resistance to
androgens. Intramuscular depot injections of testosterone
esters are commonly used in males. Other options include
oral testosterone undecanoate, and transdermal preparations.
Patients with PAIS may require supraphysiologic doses of
testosterone for optimal effect. Females with hypogonadism
require estrogen supplementation to induce pubertal changes
and menses. For women with a uterus, a progestin is usually
added after breakthrough bleeding develops or within 1–2
years of continuous estrogen.
Amongst all causes of DSD, CAH is the most important
condition that needs to be promptly diagnosed and treated.
Most commonly it manifests with a salt wasting crisis
during the 2nd week of life and if untreated may cause death.
During infancy, initial reduction of markedly elevated
adrenal sex hormones may require hydrocortisone up to
25 mg/m2 per day, but typical dosing is 10–15 mg/m2 per
day divided three times daily. Mineralocorticoid should be
replaced in the form of fludrocortisone (100–200 µg/day).
Sodium chloride supplements are often needed in infancy
(1–3 g/day) distributed in several feedings. During period of
sickness or surgery, stress doses of hydrocortisone should be
supplemented.

Approach to
Thyroid Disorders in Children
Anju Virmani

INTRODUCTION
Thyroid disorders are common in childhood, and can cause
significant morbidity. Symptoms may be confusing or
misleading, but diagnosis and treatment are becoming easier
with increasing availability of reliable hormone and other
tests, and wide availability of inexpensive medication. Yet this
increases the responsibility of the pediatrician to take timely
and correct decisions. This chapter will discuss the approach
to the following:
• Universal thyroid screening
• Hypothyroidism
• Hyperthyroidism.

CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM
Of the various thyroid disorders, congenital hypothyroidism
(CH) is the most important as it needs early diagnosis based
on lab screening and early treatment, if permanent brain
damage is to be prevented. Congenital hypothyroidism is
the most common cause of preventable mental retardation.
Because 90% of affected newborns look normal, the costeffectiveness of screening each and every newborn is
undoubted. Worldwide incidence is reported as 1 in 3,000–
4,000 newborns, but in India, it may be much higher. Several
hospitals now screen all newborns, and some states have also
begun programs for universal screening.

Clinical Pearl
• All newborns must get thyroid function tested, not just those
whose mothers have thyroid disorders. If not done at birth,
it should be done whenever the baby is first seen (e.g., for
vaccination).

International recommendations for mass newborn
screening advise taking a heel prick sample on special filter

ch-113.indd 556

papers on day 3–5 of age (or at time of discharge). This timing is
meant to reduce the impact of the neonatal thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) surge, and allow for screening of other
disorders like phenylketonuria which cannot be done in cord
blood. If only CH screening is planned, to avoid problems due
to early discharge of mothers, cord blood can be collected, as
was done in early studies in the 1970s. This has several logistic
advantages: it is easily done in 100% deliveries, no needle
prick is needed, the report is available by the time the baby is
discharged, hence in those newborns in whom confirmation
by repeat testing and start of replacement is required, it is
easily done well in time.
The primary TSH method is most widely used, with a
sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 99%; the best method
is combined TSH and thyroxine (T4) screening, which is
somewhat more expensive (higher cost of testing, lesser cost
of recall and confirmation). Most programs use a cutoff for
TSH of greater than 20–25 mU/mL. The American Academy
of Pediatrics suggests a cutoff of greater than 40 mU/mL.
Any level above this should be confirmed by an urgent
repeat venous sample for T4 and TSH, so that replacement
can be started within 1–2 weeks of life. Once the diagnosis is
confirmed (usually TSH is >50 mU/mL), if it is conveniently
possible, a Tc-99m thyroid scan should be done: this would
help in diagnosing dysgenesis (agenesis, hypoplasia, and
ectopia, i.e., lingual thyroid). Treatment should not be delayed
just to obtain a scan.
Initial doses of thyroxine are 10–15 µg/kg, i.e., usually
25–50 µg given orally as a once-daily dose, to allow for rapid
normalization of serum T4. Doses should be titrated on the
basis of serum T4 (keep in the upper half of normal range) and
TSH, done after 2 weeks of starting, then every 1–2 months for
the first 6 months, then every 3–4 months till age 3 years. It
must be remembered that up to age 3–4 months, normal TSH
levels are up to 9 mU/mL.

11/21/2016 2:40:38 PM

Chapter 113: Approach to Thyroid Disorders in Children

Clinical Pearl
• Congenital hypothyroidism confirmation should be done
urgently, so that thyroxine can be started as soon as possible.
This should preferably begin by age 2 weeks, to ensure normal
brain development.

If a cause of permanent CH is found, e.g., dysgenesis,
parents are explained that treatment is needed lifelong.
Otherwise, to confirm if CH is permanent or transient, thyroxine
is discontinued at the age of 2.5–3 years for 4–5 weeks, and
T4, TSH (and if necessary, thyroid scan) repeated. If the TSH
rises, thyroxine replacement is reinstituted (monitored by T4
and TSH every 6–12 months), and the family explained that
replacement would be needed lifelong.
Periodic training of staff and validation of correctness of
sample collection and lab performance is essential, especially
with filter paper samples.

HYPOTHYROIDISM IN THE OLDER CHILD
Symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism are variable and often
subtle, so a high index of suspicion is needed. These may be
slow height gain, unexplained weight gain, decreased academic
performance, dullness, fatigue, lethargy and increased sleep,
cold intolerance, constipation, puffy pale face, dry skin and
hair, irregular and/ or heavy periods, bradycardia, hoarse voice,
and thinning of sides of eyebrows. The most common causes
are chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and iodine deficiency;
rarer causes include CH (diagnosed late), pituitary disorders,
surgery, or radioiodine ablation. Children with Turner
syndrome, Down syndrome, and autoimmune disorders like
type 1 diabetes mellitus or celiac disease, are more prone to
primary hypothyroidism, and should be screened periodically.
Diagnosis is relatively straightforward: serum levels of
T4 and TSH. Sampling should preferably be done in the

morning, as TSH levels decrease in the evening. Serum
triiodothyronine (T3) rarely contributes to the diagnosis.
Thyroid antibodies are expensive, and do not alter the
management. In addition, they may be present in 5–10% of
the normal population, and raised antibodies in themselves
do not justify any medication. Increased TSH with low T4 is
diagnostic of primary hypothyroidism. Low T4 with normal,
low, or even mildly increased TSH is diagnostic of secondary/
tertiary hypothyroidism, which is much rarer. Secondary
hypothyroidism should be thought of if there is any reason to
suspect pituitary or hypothalamic disorders. Indian normative
data for thyroid hormones is comparable with that elsewhere.

Clinical Pearl
• Hypothyroidism must be confirmed by lab testing. Treatment
started on clinical suspicion alone is not justified.

Replacement is also quite straightforward: with oral
thyroxine. Even if iodine deficiency is suspected or proven,
iodine should not be given for treatment. Thyroxine is started as
a once daily oral dose of 2–10 µg/kg. Higher doses are needed
in young children; with age, the dose/kg reduces, such that the
total daily dose is not very different across different ages. Iron,
soya, and calcium can interfere with absorption of thyroxine,
and should not be given within a few hours of medication.
Doses are titrated on the basis of serum TSH (which takes
4–5 weeks to normalize) and T4. Thus, testing should be done
after 6 weeks of a dose change, and every 3–6 months if no dose
change is needed. Testing TSH too soon after a dose change
can be misleading. Growth and puberty should be monitored,
and should proceed normally if replacement is adequate. Once
growth is complete, a trial of stopping thyroxine can be offered:
thyroxine is stopped for 4–5 weeks and then TSH tested. If the
TSH rises, thyroxine is reinstituted (monitored by T4 and TSH
every 6–12 months), and the family explained that replacement
would be needed lifelong.

Section 13: Endocrinology

Clinical Pearl
• Thyroid stimulating hormone takes 4–6 weeks to change.
Testing too soon after a dose change may be misleading.

Thyroid stimulating hormone levels of less than
10 mU/mL with normal T4 levels are considered compensated
chemical hypothyroidism, and ordinarily may not
or bio­
merit replacement with thyroxine. Obese children often have
mildly raised TSH, and should not be labeled hypothyroid
unless they are short (cf. midparental height) or growing
slowly. In most obese children, the cause is related to excess
calories in diet and inadequate exercise: such children tend
to be tall, which is not compatible with hypothyroidism.
However, replacement may be considered if symptoms are
significant or if growth velocity is subnormal. In a child with
slow height gain, evaluation of growth hormone status should
only be done after normalizing thyroid status. In this situation
also, treatment of compensated hypothyroidism may be
considered.

Clinical Pearl
• All obese children are not hypothyroid. Start treatment if the
TSH is >10, and/or the T4 is low, and the child is short for age
and midparental height, or growing slowly.

HYPERTHYROIDISM
Hyperthyroidism is uncommon in children, and symptoms
and signs are even more variable and confusing, so a high
index of suspicion is needed. These may be unexplained weight
loss often in spite of increased appetite, decreased academic
performance, irritability, palpitations, sweating, nervousness,
fatigue, poor sleep, and heat intolerance. Goiter is almost always
present. Signs include nervousness, fine tremors, warm sweaty
palms, tachycardia, and exophthalmos. The most common
causes are Graves’ disease (GD), initial stages of thyroiditis,
or an autonomous thyroid nodule. Serum T4 and T3 are high,
and TSH is suppressed; antibodies may be positive. Rarely, T3
may be raised with normal T4 (T3 toxicosis). A thyroid scan is
useful to distinguish GD, which shows increased uptake, from
thyroiditis, (put comma) which will show decreased, patchy
uptake, or from a nodule, which shows up as a discrete lesion.

Clinical Pearl
• Thyroid scan is useful in distinguishing the cause of hyper­
thyroidism, and in guiding which treatment is appropriate.

558

Treatment of GD can be with drugs, radioactive iodine
(RAI) ablation, or surgery. Thyroiditis merely needs sympto­
matic relief with b-blockers till hypothyroidism sets in. An
autonomous nodule needs surgical excision.
Usually, GD is initially treated with antithyroid drugs,
usually neomercazole. Doses are titrated on the basis of serum

TSH and T4. Beta-blockers are needed for symptomatic relief.
Remissions can be seen in up to two-thirds of patients, but over
half of them later relapse. In those with allergy to antithyroid
drugs, or prolonged therapy (no remission, or relapse), ablation
with RAI or surgery may be needed.
In general, RAI ablation is preferred as there is no
risk of anesthesia or scarring. However, RAI ablation is
contraindicated if the patient is pregnant, and does not work
well if the gland is nodular or very large, when surgery is
needed. If ophthalmopathy is present, it may get aggravated,
so surgery is preferable. Thyroidectomy gives immediate relief,
but common complications include transient or permanent
hypoparathyroidism and injury to the recurrent laryngeal
nerve. Risks are lower in experienced hands, so it should be
done in centers with considerable experience.

THYROID NODULE
The biggest concern with a thyroid nodule is whether it is
malignant or benign. Thyroid cancer, uncommon in general, is
even rarer in children. Most nodules are picked up incidentally
by family or physician, or on radiologic examination. A
history of previous thyroid disease or radia­tion to the head/
neck region, or family history of thyroid disease is important.
A multinodular goiter is usually due to thyroiditis and/or
iodine deficiency, and almost always benign. A single nodule
or palpable lymph nodes are more worrying. During workup, apart from TSH and T4, a careful ultrasound should look
at the size of the gland, the number, size, and appearance of

11/21/2016 2:40:38 PM

Chapter 113: Approach to Thyroid Disorders in Children
nodules and cervical lymph nodes. A fine needle aspiration
cytology (FNAC) to look for malignancy should be done from
a nodule which is single, suspicious looking, or increasing in
size. If the cells are follicular, since adenoma and carcinoma
cannot be distinguished on FNAC, the entire nodule would
have to be surgically removed (lobectomy). If a papillary
carcinoma is detected, or FNAC is suspicious for malignancy, a
total thyroidectomy should be done. If the TSH is suppressed, a
Tc-99m thyroid scan would be useful as a “hot” autonomously
functioning nodule is less likely to be malignant.

Endocrine Hypertension in Children
Sudha R Chandrashekhar

INTRODUCTION
Systemic hypertension is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in adults and is an emerging public health concern.
Hypertension in childhood and adolescence tracks into
adulthood. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age
from 15% in young adults to 60% in persons older than 65 years
of age. The reported prevalence of hypertension in children
is around 5% and hence, routine measurement of blood
pressure (BP) in children is recommended to pick up this
silent killer disease. In infants and younger children, systemic
hypertension is almost always secondary to an underlying
disease process and hence, careful and thorough evaluation is
essential. Endocrine hypertension in children is less common
than renovascular or cardiovascular causes.
Diagnosis of hypertension depends on accurate measure­
ment of BP which is a difficult and time-consuming part of
clinical examination. Blood pressure is measured in a calm and
quite child, may be in parent’s lap, with a cuff size completely
encircling upper part of the arm and an inflatable bladder
covering two-thirds of upper arm length and encircling at
least three-fourths of the circumference. Although Doppler
or oscillometric methods are useful, sphygmomanometry
happens to be the gold standard and the time of appearance
of the first sound and complete disappearance of Korotkoff
sound is taken as systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. Mean
of at least three BP readings is taken as the representative
value. Interpretation of BP is dependent on age, gender, height,
and population-specific reference standards.
Hypertension, defined as either systolic or diastolic BP
more than 95th percentile of the reference standard, can be
primary or essential where cause is not known or secondary to
cardiac, renal, or endocrine disturbances.
Multiple endocrine systems can lead to hypertension—
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), mineralo­
corticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, catecholamine and
sympathetic nervous system, the kinin system, vasopressin,

CLINICAL APPROACH TO
ENDOCRINE HYPERTENSION
Primary hypertension in children and adolescents is incidentally
detected as they are silent and chronic. Secondary hyper­tension
that is sustained or is rising rapidly is always symptomatic and
mode of presentation depends on age of the child.
Symptoms in infants could vary from irritability, poor
feeding, lethargy, vomiting to convulsions, altered sensorium,
paresis/paralysis, or congestive cardiac failure. Older children
may complain of headache, behavioral changes, epistaxis,
dizziness, and visual disturbances. Intense headache,
vomiting, ataxia, hyperthermia, altered consciousness, and
seizures suggest hypertensive encephalopathy and is a medical
emergency.
To rule out cardiac causes, palpation of all peripheral
pulses, four limb BP measurements, and auscultation of
abdominal bruit is essential. Renal cause of hypertension is
either renovascular or glomerular and hence, presence of

urinary symptoms like oliguria, dysuria, gross hematuria,
anasarca, pallor, failure to thrive, rickets must be looked for.
Signs of systemic diseases like vasculitis syndrome, collagen
vascular disorder, neurocutaneous syndrome should be
examined.
Features of stigmata of endocrine disturbances like
Cushing syndrome (centripetal fat distribution, pink striae,
buffalo hump, etc.), hyperthyroidism (tachycardia, palpitation,
flushes, loss of weight, etc.), pheochromocytoma (episodes of
palpitation, sweating, flushes, etc.), palpable abdominal mass
(Wilms’ tumor, pheochromocytoma, adrenal tumor, etc.),
features of atypical genitalia [congenital adrenal hyperplasia
(CAH) 11β-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase deficiency] are
clues to underlying diagnosis (Table 1).
High body mass index, presence of acanthosis nigricans,
and normal stature suggest metabolic syndrome and the
hypertension is often essential or primary where a cause is not
known. A family history for hypertension, stroke, myocardial
infarction, and dyslipidemia needs to be elicited in the firstdegree relatives.

ch-114.indd 561

• Low gonadal steroids,
• High 17-deoxy-steroids

In comparison to essential hypertension where the typical
presentation is an adolescent, who is obese with positive family
history and has mildly elevated BP without signs and symptoms
of underlying disease, secondary hypertension is seen in
younger children, with moderate-to-severe elevation of BP with
symptoms and signs pertaining to organ system affection.
Transient hypertension is seen in children with acute
illnesses like glomerulonephritis, rapid colloid infusion, drugs
(catecholamines), and autonomic disturbances. Although
hypertension is transient, these children need to be monitored
and treated as other causes.

INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH
Investigations are guided by the underlying diagnosis
suspected and are not only for ascertaining the etiology but
also to find out the degree of end organ damage.
Initial test would include screening for renal and cardiac
disorders. Thus, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum
electrolytes, routine urine analysis, testing for presence of

BP, blood pressure; PAC, plasma aldosterone concentration; PRA, plasma renin activity; CAH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

562

hematuria, proteinuria, and calciuria would be required in
all cases. Renal sonography for sizes of the kidneys, collecting
system defects besides renal Doppler and renal scan should be
done to rule out renal/renovascular cause of hypertension.
Echocardiography to rule out coarctation of aorta and endorgan changes like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diastolic
dysfunction, and carotid intimal thickness are advised.
Hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis is seen in primary or
secondary hyperaldosteronism.
Plasma renin activity helps in differentiating the high renin
(renal/renovascular hypertension) from low renin (hyper­
aldosteronism, Gordon syndrome, hypercortisolism) or
normal renin (often seen in essential hypertension) forms of
hypertension.
Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) to plasma
renin activity (PRA) ratio helps in differentiating primary
hyperaldosteronism wherein the PAC/PRA ratio is greater
than 20 from secondary hyperaldosteronism (renovascular
disease, renin producing tumors, coarctation of aorta) where
it is less than 10. These ratios are very high in aldosterone
producing adrenal adenoma. Both PAC and PRA are low in
hypercortisolism and thus the ratio is less than 10. Saline loading
test, fludrocortisone suppression, or captopril challenge tests
are other confirmatory tests for primary hyperaldosteronism.
Urinary vanillylmandelic acid (sensitivity 63%, specificity
94%), urinary catecholamine (sensitivity 73%, specificity

ch-114.indd 562

94%), plasma epinephrine/metane­
phrine (sensitivity 85%,
specificity 80%), urinary total metanephrine (sensitivity 76%,
specificity 94%), plasma-free metanephrine (sensitivity 99%,
specificity 92%) levels are useful in children suspected to have
pheochromo­cytoma.
Urinary and plasma steroid profile in CAH, hyper­
cortisolism; thyroid profile in suspected hyperthyroidism;
serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and serum 25-hydroxy­
vitamin D levels in hypercalcemia; are some of the other tests
which provide diagnostic clue.
Radiographic imaging of the adrenals, 123I-metaiodo­benzyl­
cytoma,
guanidine (MIBG) scan in suspected pheochromo­
positron emission tomography radiotracers like fluorine-18
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA), 18-fluoro-2-deoxy­
glucose (18F-FDG), etc. help localizing tumors as cause of
hypertension.
Detailed ophthalmological evaluation for hypertensive
retinopathy and urine for microalbuminuria for hypertensive
nephro­pathy should also be checked to rule out end-organ
effects.

TREATMENT
Therapy is provided to children with persistent hypertension
and the goal is to decrease BP to less than 95th percentile of the
target for age, gender, and height.

11/21/2016 2:42:10 PM

Chapter 114: Endocrine Hypertension in Children
In mild cases as also in adolescents with primary
hypertension, this could be achieved by nonpharmacological
means like dietary modifications, weight reduction, regular
exercise, and stress reduction. Sodium intake restricted to less
than 1.2 g per day by avoiding added salt in the diet, pickles,
baked, canned, and processed foods help decrease BP. Fruits
and nuts beneficial in lowering BP should be included in the
diet. Regular exercise schedule helps and outdoor activities
like swimming, running, sports should be promoted. Weight
reduction is an important therapeutic aspect of BP control in
obese children.
Children with persistent hypertension require long-term
therapy and the drug of choice depends on the underlying
patho­physiology.
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are used in
high renin hypertension (renovascular, essential). Angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) like losartan are useful in high renin
hypertension wherein they block angiotensin II receptors.
Aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone) or ARB (eplerenone)
is used in hyperaldosterone states. Adrenergic blockers
(labetalol, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol) are indicated in
increased catecholamine states (pheochromocytoma, neural
crest tumors). Diuretics are indicated in high volume output
states.
Calcium channel blockers are often used as first line
antihypertensives.
In hypertensive crisis, gradual drop in BP over 24–48 hours
should be aimed with a drop of not more than 25% every
hour as acute drop in BP leads to ischemic damage to brain,
myocardium, retina, and kidneys. Controlled drop in BP is
best achieved with nitroprusside infusion drip. Sublingual
nifedipine can be used where facilities for infusion or
monitoring for cyanide toxicity are not available. Labetalol and
nicardipine infusions can also be used.

Clinical Pearls
• Hypertension in children is often due to an organic cause
• Measurement of blood pressure should always be done
annually in children as a screening parameter
• Blood pressure measurement should be done with appropriate
cuff size and interpreted in relation to age gender and height
• Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be recorded
• Investigations depend on clinical clues to underlying etiology
• Therapy is tailored to the underlying pathophysiology.

Approach to Oligoarthritis
Vijay Viswanathan

Introduction
Arthritis in childhood is not that uncommon as it may sound.
Depending on the number of joints involved, it could either be
oligoarticular (≤4 joints) or polyarticular (≥5 joints). Formerly
known as pauciarticular, the oligoarticular variant can be a
single joint (monoarthritis) or more than a single but less than
4 joints. It could be acute or chronic. A detailed history with
regards to the onset, pattern of involvement, presentation, and
duration of arthritis help differentiate between the various
possible diagnoses. This, coupled with a meticulous clinical
examination and supported by relevant investigations, help
in nailing the diagnosis. In this chapter a clinical approach to
decipher oligoarticular presentation in a child is discussed.

Definition
Acute monoarthritis: it is inflammation of one joint only,
characterized by pain, swelling, redness, and/or restriction of
movement with duration of less than 3 weeks.
Chronic monoarthritis: arthritis in the single joint lasting for at
least 6 weeks is said to be chronic (Box 1).

Scenario 1: Reactive/Postinfectious Arthritis
Many viral illnesses may be followed by onset of inflammation
at the joints after an incubation period. Most of them are selflimiting and do not leave any long-term deformities. A few
specific types of the same with some salient features are shown
in box 2.

Box 2: Specific causes of postinfectious/reactive arthritis
Postinfectious/viral
• Immediately/weeks to
months
• Pauci/polyarticular
• Lower limb joints knees/
ankles
• Flu virus, parvovirus B19, C

Box 1: Causes of monoarthritis in children

• Coxsackie, chikungunya,
arbovirus, HIV, hepatitis A,
and HBsAg

Acute
• Septic arthritis

Poststreptococcal RA
• Short incubation period

• Reactive
• Hemarthrosis

11/21/2016 2:52:28 PM

Chapter 115: Approach to Oligoarthritis

Clinical Pearls
• Most cases of postinfectious/reactive arthritis (RA) are selflimiting
• Anti-inflammatory agents/intra-articular steroids form the
main line of therapy
• Poststreptococcal RA necessitates a two dimensional echo­
cardiography and occasionally penicillin prophylaxis
• Transient synovitis can recur in 4–17% (first 6 months);
differentiation from infection is mandatory.

Scenario 2: Septic Arthritis
Septic arthritis in infancy and childhood is a true clinical
emergency. Delay in the diagnosis and treatment of septic
arthritis can result in disastrous complications including
complete destruction of the articular cartilage and epiphysis,
loss of the growth plate, and joint dislocation.

Clinical Pearls
• Fever, malaise, along with erythema, local warmth, and
significant pain.
• Pain on passive motion (many times position of pseudoparalysis)
highly suggestive of septic arthritis
• Joint aspiration is a must in all doubtful scenarios (occasionally
fluid may be sterile)
• Imaging is not the primary means of diagnosing septic arthritis
• Ensure complete therapy for 4–6 weeks.

Scenario 3: Malignancies
Hematological malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma) as
well as localized osseous, malignancy (osteosarcoma/ Ewing’s
sarcoma) can present with musculoskeletal complaints.
Symptoms of arthritis, sometimes with a migratory pattern can
precede hematological feature of malignancy by months.

Clinical Pearls
•
•
•
•
•
•

Sick child with nocturnal pains (bone pains)
Periarticular pain
Pallor
Lymphadenopathy
Organomegaly
High lymphocytes, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
with low platelets
• Whenever in doubt, order a marrow prior to starting steroids.

Scenario 4: Mechanical Causes
Acute pain and limitation of movement may be due to
mechanical causes such as Osgood-Schlatter syndrome
(osteochondritis), which is a painful condition caused by
irritation and sometimes fragmentation at the tibial tuberosity.

ch-115.indd 565

It is an apophysitis of the immature skeleton subjected to too
much physical strain causing pull on the tibial tubercle that sits
adjacent to a growth plate. Slipped upper femoral epiphyses
occurring in adolescent/preadolescent boys can present with
hip pain/knee pain (due to radiation from hip). Perthes disease
or avascular necrosis of head of femur is classically seen in
toddlers and early childhood. It affects boys more than girls,
and presents as a painful limp. In addition, children who have
excess ligament laxity (hypermobile) do complain aches and
pains and also benign joint effusions.
A detailed history and clinical examination reveal that
the problem is mechanical and there is no/mild arthritis on
examination.

CHRONIC OLIGOARTICULAR PRESENTATION
History
Inquire about systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss,
and night sweats.
Detailed history of morning stiffness, night pains, and
restriction of activities are important. History of a recent sore
throat, gastroenteritis, red and painful eyes, and chronic skin
disease such as psoriasis or significant trauma should be asked
for. A past history of tuberculosis (TB) or contact with an open
case of TB is important in India, where monoarticular disease
in a child is often considered to be TB unless proved otherwise.
It is also important to check for the history of recent travel to
an area endemic for Lyme disease, brucellosis, or a history of
tick bite.

Examination
Detailed general, systemic, and local examination as
previously outlined above including skin examination,
formal ophthalmology evaluation by slit lamp for uveitis, and
musculoskeletal examination are a must in all children who
present with a single swollen joint.

Chronic Oligoarticular
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) can present
with less than 4 joints (oligo persistent) or can involve more
than 4 joints after 6 months (oligo extended).

Clinical Pearls
• Systemically well
• Present with a painless limp with swollen joint
• Blood tests are usually normal with magnetic resonance
imaging revealing effusion and synovitis
• Antinuclear antibody positivity associated with uveitis
• Intra-articular steroids form first line therapy
• Good prognosis except in extended oligovariant
• Rule out mimics like tuberculosis, pigmented villonodular
synovitis and associated collagen disorder.

Approach to Polyarthritis
Rashna D Hazarika

INTRODUCTION
Joint diseases in children are not so uncommon and can
range from infections to injuries to hematological conditions
like hemophilia, leukemia, and to the more serious forms of
arthritis of varying etiology and prognosis. It often becomes
a cause of concern for parents and caretakers especially if the
etiology is of a chronic nature. An approach to polyarthritis in
children has been discussed in this chapter.
Arthritis is inflammation of the joints and can be a single or
a multiple joint involvement. Usually, single joint involvement,
like septic arthritis, prompts the parents to seek urgent medical
care. Similarly, patients with polyarthritis require detailed
evaluation and investigation as the causes are varied and
some, like leukemia and lupus, have serious consequences
if not treated at the appropriate time. The other important
aspect of approaching a child with polyarthritis is “pattern
recognition”. Polyarticular joint disease has multifactorial
etiology. It may present as an acute self-limiting viral illnesses
or it can be the beginning of a chronic sinister disease. The
underlying etiological process can be anything from infectious
or postinfectious, rheumatological, or a manifestation of
systemic diseases. It may take days or sometimes weeks for
the disease to evolve and thus make it difficult to make a
diagnosis at the time of presentation. Some viral infections
like parvovirus causes a transient self-limited polyarthritis
whereas organisms like Chlamydia, Gonococci, Salmonella,
and Shigella cause a postinfectious reactive (sterile) arthritis.
Arthritis lasting for more than 6 weeks rules out an infective
etiology. With these issues in mind, this article will try to give
an algorithmic approach to polyarthritis (Algorithm 1).

Some Definitions
•
•
•

ch-116.indd 568

Polyarthritis: involvement of more than one joint is known
as polyarthritis
Acute polyarthritis: joint involvement of less than 6 weeks
Chronic polyarthritis: joint involvement for more than
6 weeks.

Etiology
The etiology of polyarthritis is varied and outlined in table 1.

IMPORTANT POINTS IN HISTORY
Looking at the diverse etiologies of polyarthritis, it may seem
difficult to know where to start looking for a diagnostic label.
However, attention to a number of important clinical clues
both in the history and examination can help to narrow down
the possibilities. We look at each of these issues in detail.

Age
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), juvenile psoriatic arthritis,
Kawasaki disease (KD), and septic arthritis are most frequent
in early childhood (1–4 years of age). Polyarticular JIA,
Juvenile dermatomyositis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, and
Polyarteritis nodosa have their peak frequencies by midchildhood (7–11 years). Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS)
and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) show a marked
increase in late childhood. Rheumatoid factor positive arthritis
mimicking adult rheumatoid arthritis usually occurs after the
age of 10 years. Diseases like gout, calcium pyrophosphate
deposition disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, and primary
osteoarthritis almost never occur in childhood.

Sex
Polyarticular JIA and SLE have a predilection for girls whereas
JAS and KD for boys. However, many of these diseases can
occur in both the sexes and one should keep an open mind
when evaluating a patient with polyarthritis.

Onset and Duration
Usually, septic arthritis, trauma, and coagulopathies present
within hours. Viral arthritis, acute rheumatic fever, vasculitides,
leukemia, reactive arthritis, and beginning of JIA can evolve over
days to weeks. Polyarticular JIA, tubercular arthritis, sarcoidosis,

and fungal arthritis go through an indolent process and present
in weeks to months. However, many of these conditions may
be in the evolution phase in the initial weeks and it may not be
appropriate to give a diagnostic label at this stage.

Diseases such as JIA, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and
psoriasis may have a familial predilection.

Examination
The examination of the affected joints as well as picking up the
extra-articular manifestations form an important step toward

569

arriving at a diagnosis. A systemic approach in examination
has to focus on identifying the following.

Articular Involvement
Synovium, synovial fluid, articular cartilage, intra-articular
ligaments, joint capsule, and juxta-articular bone form
a part of the articular structures. Presence of pain, joint
line tenderness and limitation of both active and passive
movements, instability, locking of the joint, crepitus, and joint
deformity signify articular involvement. In addition, swelling
may be there due to synovial thickening, joint effusion, or joint
enlargement. In nonarticular involvement, findings are away
from the joint and pain may occur only on active movement.

Inflammatory Versus Noninflammatory
Signs of local inflammation are erythema, tenderness, and
redness of the joint. Systemic inflammatory signs include
fever, weight loss, and fatigue. An effusion and pain at the end
of range of movement indicates active arthritis.

Extra-articular Manifestations
Diseases like SLE, IBD, malignancies, and systemic onset JIA
have dominant extra-articular manifestations (Table 2).

Pattern of Joint Involvement
Important clues to the diagnosis can be picked up if one tries
to identify some of the patterns known with specific diseases
such as:
• Evolution of the joint pain:
{{ Migratory joint involvement is seen in acute rheumatic
fever as well as gonococcal arthritis. In acute rheumatic
fever, the joint can swell up in hours whereas in
gonococcal arthritis this happens over days
{{ Additive joint involvement where new joints are
involved when the previously affected ones are still
painful occur in poststreptococcal reactive arthritis,
SLE, JIA, and psoriasis
{{ Intermittent arthritis where the symptoms can appear
and disappear is typical of reactive arthritis
• Topography: involvement of the axial or peripheral skeleton
is an important clue to diagnosis. Axial skeleton includes
the spine, sacroiliac joints, sternoclavicular joints, and the
manubriosternal joints. Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis has
involvement of the sacroiliac and the lower spine. Others,
like JIA and SLE, have peripheral skeletal involvement
though rarely they can have a combined involvement
• Symmetry: usually symmetrical joint involvement is seen
in JIA and SLE and asymmetric joint involvement is seen in
reactive arthritis
• Specific joint involvement: some diseases involve
specific joints like dactylitis and distal interphalangeal
joint involvement indicates psoriatic arthritis. Similarly,
temporo­mandibular joint involvement indicates JIA. Most
reactive arthritis would have a lower limb joint involvement
• Presence of joint deformity: joint deformity usually follows
long standing undiagnosed or untreated arthritis and is
usually seen with JIA or hemophilia. Arthritis associated
with SLE and IBD are usually nondeforming.

More than 95% of the cases of polyarthritis can be diagnosed
based on a good history and examination. However, specific
tests like cell count and morphology can give clues to a
malignant process like leukemia, thrombocytopenia in
SLE, thrombocytosis in KD, raised acute phase reactants,
like ESR and CRP, indicate an active inflammatory process,
antineutrophil antibodies in SLE, rheumatoid factor
positivity in polyarticular JIA, human leukocyte antigen B
27 in JAS and Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody for
systemic vasculitides. Other investigations, like ASO and
echocardiography, are useful in acute rheumatic fever and
synovial fluid analysis to differentiate between an infective
and an inflammatory process.

Treatment
Treatment of polyarthritis depends on the specific diagnosis.
Pending the diagnosis, one must focus on providing
symptomatic relief by using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
agents, rest to the affected part as well as physiotherapy
if possible. A brief outline of the management is shown
in table 3. However, many diseases may require extensive
and long-term management for achieving remission and
prevention of morbidity.

Prognosis

Pattern Recognition
A good history and clinical examination can help the astute
and observant clinician recognize some typical patterns of
joint disease. Some examples are:
• Polyarthritis in a young girl may suggest SLE or poly­
articular JIA
• Scattered small distal interphalangeal joint involvement
indicates psoriatic arthritis
• Hip and lower back involvement may point toward JAS
• Inflammatory tarsal and enthesopathy may be a
distinguishing feature between JAS and JIA in the absence
of axial disease.
An algorithmic approach to polyarthritis is shown in
algorithm 1.

Prognosis depends on the diagnostic label, time to diagnosis,
presence of complications, and how aggressive the
management has been. For example, reactive arthritis would
have an excellent prognosis with supportive management,
intravenous immunoglobulin in Kawasaki disease would
lead to a possible cure and prevention of complications if
treated at the appropriate time. Early diagnosis and aggressive
management of arthritis prevent joint damage and other
complications. Acute rheumatic fever responds well to
treatment and initiation of penicillin prophylaxis prevents
future recurrences and the development of rheumatic
valvular damage. Steroids in lupus is life saving and drugs like
mycophenolate mofetil are offering good outcome in renal

how early one has been able to identify the possible etiology of
polyarthritis and initiate the treatment.

Clinical Pearls
• Pattern recognition helps to arrive at a diagnostic label

diagnosis
• Early morning stiffness characteristic of inflammatory arthritis

out sinister conditions such as leukemia, and also useful for
follow-up.

Fever with Arthritis:
An Algorithmic Approach
Sathish Kumar

INTRODUCTION
Musculoskeletal and joint diseases appear to have increased
in the last decade. Confusion over terminology and a lack of
awareness of these conditions have probably contributed
to their under recognition. In pediatric practice, physicians
are often faced with a child presenting with musculoskeletal
complaints. The differential diagnosis of fever with arthritis is
broad and includes a variety of causes. This chapter, is focused
on algorithmic approach to a child who presents with fever and
arthritis.
All joint pains are not arthritis. Arthritis is defined as
a swollen joint or a joint having at least two of the following
conditions: tenderness, limited range of motion, pain on
movement, or warmth overlying the joint.
The first step in initial screening is to establish whether
a single joint or multiple joints are involved. The second

important step is to determine whether or not there is
associated fever (Algorithm 1). For practical purposes, this
initial screening should lead to the following four possible
groups of diagnoses:
1. Single joint involvement with associated fever
2. Single joint involvement without fever
3. Multiple joint involvement with associated fever
4. Multiple joint involvement without fever.

ALGORITHMIC APPROACH TO
MONOARTHRITIS (SINGLE JOINT)
A carefully conducted history taking and physical examination
are the initial and most important steps in narrowing the
differential diagnosis and guiding the diagnostic evaluation
(Algorithm 2).

Algorithm 2
Approach to fever with monoarhritis

Physical Examination
The presence of fever should alert the clinician to the potential
for more severe conditions requiring urgent treatment (e.g.,
septic arthritis). On general examination, clues to underlying
diagnosis include rash (psoriasis, viral exanthems), iritis (IBD
or enthesitis-related arthritis), and hepatosplenomegaly/
lymphadenopathy suggestive of malignancy.
The focused examination of the affected joint should
include inspection of the skin for warmth, redness, swelling,
and soft tissue involvement, using the contralateral side for
comparison. Palpation of the surrounding bone is important
because the presence of pinpoint bony tenderness is suggestive
of fracture, osteomyelitis, or malignancy. An exquisite pain
in the joint on range of motion or a joint that is severely
restricted in its range of motion suggests an etiology other than
inflammatory arthritis (e.g., septic joint).
The differential diagnosis of monoarthritis includes
entities in the broad categories of infection, postinfection,
inflammation, and malignancy and trauma related to a
systemic illness (Box 1).
Preliminary investigations that are to be considered for the
evaluation of monoarthritis are presented in box 2. Laboratory
investigations of acute or chronic monoarthritis are performed
to confirm the clinician’s impression regarding the suspected
diagnosis or to exclude conditions.

Laboratory Investigations
WBC, white blood cell; JIA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis; SLE, systemic lupus
erythematosus; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; CRP, C-reactive protein;
RF, rheumatoid factor; ANA, antinuclear antibody.

History Taking
Important aspects to be considered in the history taking are as
follows:
• Characteristics of the pain and/or stiffness (site, number
of joints, severity, frequency, duration, pattern, and
association of warmth or discoloration). Morning stiffness
is a characteristic feature of inflammatory arthritis. Night
pain should alert the clinician to a malignancy or an
osteoid osteoma
• Review of systems focused on the presence of fever or other
constitutional symptoms (e.g., weight loss, anorexia, night
sweats, or nocturnal pain)
• Precipitating factors: traumas, infections (streptococcal,
enteric), travel to Lyme disease or tuberculosis (TB)
endemic areas or other risk factors for TB (exposure to a
person with TB; close contact with a person with a positive
TB skin test result)
• Presence of extra-articular features (diarrhea, urethral
discharge, ocular symptoms, and rash)
• Personal or family history of a bleeding diathesis or human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27-associated diseases like
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), acute anterior uveitis,
psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis.

Complete blood count (CBC) and differential white blood cell
count, inflammatory markers, and liver and renal functions
should be considered in any child with monoarthritis.
If the presentation is acute (<72 hours), a joint aspiration
must be performed if the clinician is concerned about a septic
joint, with the fluid sent for blood cell count, Gram stain, and
culture. In addition, culture of the throat, blood, stool, and/or
urine should be considered to identify a potential organism
in the case of reactive arthritis. An acute presentation is also
observed with hematologic and malignant diseases (e.g.,
hemophilia and leukemia), highlighting the importance of
CBC and coagulation studies. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) and

• Bone marrow aspiration
• Slit lamp examination of the eyes

antideoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNaseB) titers are useful to
identify a recent streptococcal infection.
In chronic monoarthritis, Lyme serology (when history is
suggestive of an exposure) and antinuclear antibody (ANA)
and rheumatoid factor (RF) titers should be considered.
Human leukocyte antigen B27 testing is most relevant in
chronic arthritis when the child is suspected of having a specific
category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (enthesitis-related
arthritis), which is generally seen in boys older than 8 years
and often associated with enthesitis, lumbosacral back pain,
and a family history of HLA-B27-associated diseases (e.g., IBD,
ankylosing spondylitis).
The presence of ANA or RF is neither necessary nor
sufficient to make a diagnosis of JIA. Antinuclear antibody
should not be used as a screening test for rheumatic illness in a
primary care setting, because it may be positive in up to 5–10%
of healthy children.
Antinuclear antibody is used as a diagnostic test for
children with probable systemic lupus erythematosus
or mixed connective tissue disease and other overlaplike illnesses. In the context of JIA, a positive ANA titer is
associated with a significantly increased risk of developing
chronic anterior uveitis.
Rheumatoid factor has been associated with aging
(>60 years), infections (bacterial endocarditis, hepatitis B
or C, parasitic disease, viral infection), pulmonary disease
(sarcoidosis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis), malignancy, and
primary biliary cirrhosis and thus is not a specific test for the
diagnosis of rheumatic disease.
Only 5–10% of patients with JIA have a positive RF,
highlighting the lack of sensitivity for the diagnosis of JIA.
A joint aspiration must be performed when a septic
joint (bacterial) is suspected but is also recommended for
the diagnosis of TB arthritis. The presence of hemarthrosis
suggests coagulation disorder, trauma, or rare causes,
including synovial hemangioma or pigmented villonodular
synovitis. The more common and/or serious causes of
monoarthritis are addressed here.
Septic arthritis: this condition classically presents with a
severely painful, swollen, warm, and red joint in a febrile
child. The join must be aspirated for Gram stain, cultures

ch-117.indd 575

and examination of the synovial fluid, and cell count. In the
absence of Gram stain or culture, a cell count of 40,000/mm3 is
regarded as evidence of bacterial infection.
Osteomyelitis: with reactive arthritis or sympathetic arthritis,
this is arthritis with effusion in a nearby joint as a reaction to
osteomyelitis. A technetium or gallium joint bone scan often
reveals an osteomyelitis in the adjacent bone.
Presence of foreign body in the joint: a thorn, shard of glass, or
other foreign body may cause a secondary infection or sterile
synovitis. Computerized tomographic scan is superior to a
radiograph in demonstrating a nonopaque foreign body.
Traumatic arthritis: traumatic serosanguineous effusion can
cause fever secondary to blood within the joint. There is almost
always a history of trauma. Aspiration usually reveals sterile
surgery will reveal the nature of this condition. In addition,
clotting abnormalities must be ruled out.
Rheumatic diseases: oligoarticular onset of juvenile idiopathic
arthritis may present with single joint disease. Usually, one of
the large joints is affected, and the patient is either afebrile or has
a low grade fever. Very rarely, children with systemic onset JIA
may also present initially with monoarticular disease, usually
in the knee or hip. In that case, look for other manifestations
of the disease such as rheumatoid rash, hepatosplenomegaly,
lymphadenopathy, pericarditis and, in rare instances, iritis. A
diagnosis of JIA is made based on history taking and physical
examination and after exclusion of other causes.
It is unusual for children with systemic lupus erythematosus
to present with single joint involvement. Occasionally,
rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease, juvenile dermatomyositis,
and certain viral infections may begin with arthritis affecting
one joint.
Postinfectious reactive arthritis: this includes postviral or
postbacterial diseases such as post-streptococcal reactive
arthritis and post-salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia reactive
arthritis. These postviral or postbacterial conditions have a
benign, self-limited course that may require symptomatic and
supportive therapy.
Toxic synovitis: if the hip joint is affected, toxic synovitis must
be taken into account. It is also called transient synovitis and,
occurs in children aged 8 ± 10. Most of the patients are boys,
and there is often a history of respiratory infection. Within a
few weeks, a limp and pain referred to the knee develop along
with a low grade fever. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate
may be mildly elevated. The disease usually subsides after 1 ±
2 weeks and does not commonly recur. However, Legg-CalvePerthes disease is occasionally a sequelae.
Hemoglobinopathy: in a child, sickle cell anemia must be
ruled out by hemoglobin electrophoresis. In the very young
child, it causes a dactylitis that may mimic true arthritis;
in older children it causes microinfarcts that give rise to
periostitis and periarthritis which are responsible for the pain
crises in this disease.
Malignancies: leukemia is the most common malignancy
in childhood. However, it rarely presents with single joint
involvement. Tumors, such as synovial cell sarcoma or

575

Section 14: Rheumatology
bone tumors like osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma, can
rarely present as single joint involvement with fever. In any
malignancy, bone pain is usually prominent, and other features,
such as weight loss and fatigue, are commonly present.

POLYARTHRITIS (MULTIPLE JOINTS)

there are clues in the characteristics of the arthritis, fever, rash,
and other system involvements that often provide the correct
diagnosis (Table 1).
When polyarthritis is the presenting complaint, in addition
to the investigations outlined in box 2, additional investiga­
tions may include serum C3 and C4 complement levels,
serum levels of quantitative immunoglobulins, urinalysis,
serologic testing for viral pathogens, swabs for gonococcal

anti-La, anti-Smith, anti-ribonucleoprotein, anti-Scl 70), and
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.

Conclusion
Differential diagnosis for monoarthritis and polyarthritis
is broad. An organized approach within the framework
presented, including carefully attending to clues in the history
taking and physical examination allows for correct diagnosis
in most cases. Laboratory evaluation is performed to support
the clinician’s impression. Serious and/or potentially lifethreatening infections, malignant or orthopedic causes need to
be identified, and the patient is referred for surgical or medical
management.

Clinical Pearls
• Presence of antinuclear antibody or rheumatoid factor is
neither necessary nor sufficient to make a diagnosis of juvenile
idiopathic arthritis
• Antinuclear antibody should not be used as a screening test
for rheumatic illness in a primary care setting, because it may
be positive in 5–10% of healthy children
• High antistreptolysin O titer with arthralgia does not warrant
Penicillin prophylaxis.

Key points

))
A detailed history and physical examination are critical in
the initial assessment, with attention paid to the nature of
the pain, presence of limp, weight-bearing status, morning

stiffness, systemic symptoms (fever, rash, weight loss, fatigue),
history of past medical illnesses, travel or positive family history
(arthritis, bleeding disorders, sickle cell anemia, inﬂammatory
bowel disease, psoriasis)

))
The important aspects of physical examination include
assessing the joints (swelling, erythema, warmth, tenderness,
deformity, range of motion), adjacent structures (bones,
tendons, muscles, skin), and gait and leg length discrepancy

))
The extent of investigations is determined from the infor­
mation gained through the history and physical examination

))
Basic screening laboratory tests and radiographs of the
affected site should be obtained. Additional investigations
can be performed to arrive at a clinical diagnosis

))
Fever, redness, moderate-to-severe pain, pinpoint pain
or tenderness, and weight loss are clues to more serious
causes of limb pain that require additional investigations and
referrals to specialists (rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons,
neurologists, hematologist/oncologists).

Childhood Vasculitis
Indira Banerjee, Rakesh Mondal

INTRODUCTION
Vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of blood vessel
walls with resultant tissue ischemia and necrosis. The first case
was described by Adolf Kussmaul and Rudolf Maier more than
150 years ago, when they described a patient with what is today
known as polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Since then, many more in
these categories have been described. Most pediatric vasculitis
disorders need individual specific classification criterias for
their identification.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Estimated overall annual incidence of new cases of pediatric
vasculitis is 53.3 per 100,000 children under 17 years of age.
The two most common vasculitides were Henoch-Schönlein
purpura (HSP) and Kawasaki disease, with estimated annual
incidences of 20.4 and 5.5 per 100,000 in children less than
17 years of age, respectively. Reported geographical variations
in vasculitis may reflect an environmental influence, like
infections, drugs, allergy, vaccination, and desensitization
procedures.

PATHOGENESIS
The exact pathogenesis of pediatric vasculitis is not known.
The proposed mechanisms are vascular injury caused by
inflammation of vascular wall (vasculitis). The triggers for
injury are genetic, environmental, infective, and immune
factors.
Irrespective of the initial insult, inflicted injury to the
vessel wall resulted in healing of vascular wall by fibrosis. It
causes narrowing of vascular lumen and ischemic injury to
target organ. Abnormal healing of the vascular wall leads to
aneurysm formation with disorganized blood flow which
can lead to ischemic target organ damage with or without
thrombus formation (Fig. 1).

CLASSIFICATION
International Consensus Conference in Vienna (June 2005)
under the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society resulted
in a new proposal for childhood vasculitis classification
summarized in box 1. These were validated and given the final
form at the 2008 Ankara Consensus Conference with support
from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and

There has been trend for use of vasculitic disorders names that
reflect increased pathophysiologic understanding of these
conditions. Revision in the commonly used terms has been
proposed by the 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus
Conference (CHCC) on nomenclature of vasculitides. Among
the notable changes suggested by the 2012 CHCC were use
of the term eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(EGPA), in place of Churg-Strauss syndrome, and adoption
of the term antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)
associated vasculitis for the three disorders likely microscopic
polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s),
and EGPA.

Algorithmic Approach
to Childhood Vasculitis
Diagnosis and treatment of childhood vasculitis is explained in
detail below (Algorithm 1).

ch-118.indd 579

Suspect Childhood Vasculitis
Common symptoms suggestive of childhood vasculitis include:
• Appearance: miserable look, more in pain or irritable, and
no toxic look
• Systemic features: fever, weight loss, fatigue, and arthralgias
• Skin manifestation: range from palpable purpura to
urticaria, livedo reticularis, nodules, and ulcers, even
gangrenes
• Hypertension
	  Organ specific involvement: this depends on the size of
the vessel involved, degree of collateral circulation, and the
organ involved:
{{ Nephrology: hematuria and proteinuria
{{ Joints: arthritis and joint effusions
{{ Muscles: myalgia and myositis
{{ Serous cavities: serositis
{{ Cardiac: hypertension, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy
{{ Pulmonary: infiltrates, infract and or hemorrhage
{{ Neurologic: mono- or polyneuritis.

Churg-Strauss syndrome
The proposed classification criteria for presence of ChurgStrauss syndrome is any four or more of the six criteria:
• Asthma
• Eosinophilia >10%
• Neuropathy: mono- or polyneuropathy
• Pulmonary infiltrates, non-fixed
• Paranasal sinus abnormality
• Extravascular eosinophils.

Microscopic polyangiitis
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is characterized by necrotizing
vasculitis with few or no immune deposits affecting small
vessels.
Clinical features of MPA include disease involving
the kidneys, lungs, joints, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and
peripheral nerves. The cardinal features of MPA include
glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, fever, and
mono­
neuritis multiplex. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is
very common. Pulmonary capillaritis often occurs, but no
granulomatous lesions of the respiratory tract is seen.

Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa

Rule Out Mimickers

Cutaneous PAN is limited to skin with possible manifestations
in the musculoskeletal system. It is characterized by the:
• Presence of painful subcutaneous nodules
• Nonpurpuric lesions with or without livedo reticularis
• With no systemic involvement (except for myalgia,
arthralgia, and nonerosive arthritis).

Mimickers for vasculitis include following:
• Infections such as pneumococcal, mycobacterial, rickettsial
• Connective tissue disorders
• Bacterial endocarditis
• Atrial myxoma
• Vasoconstrictive drugs such as ergot
• Malignancy such as lymphomas
• Disorders associated with antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome.

Granulomatous type
Granulomatous polyangiitis
In January 2011, the Board of Directors of the American
College of Rheumatology, the American Society of Nephrology,
and the EULAR recommended that the name Wegener’s
granulomatosis be changed to granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(Wegener’s), abbreviated as GPA.
The proposed classification criteria for GPA were that three
of the following six criteria should be presented:
• Abnormal urinalysis
• Granulomatous inflammation on biopsy

The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by some specific tests in
association with supportive indicators and specific pattern of
clinical involvement such as:
• Tissue biopsy (PAN)
• X-rays of the sinuses and chest
• Angiographic studies of the vessels (PAN, Takayasu
arteritis)
• Nerve conduction studies

Indian Scenario

582

Large studies with uniform comprehensive data are not
available from Asia. Indian data that included adult population
is not a true representation of pediatric vasculitides from all
over the country.
A pediatric study was done from Eastern India over a
period of 7 years (2004 to 2010), on prospectively followed
up children (under 12 years) with vasculitis from a tertiary
care hospital from Kolkata. The study revealed 10.2% children
(n = 158) had vasculitis among all rheumatological cases

ch-118.indd 582

(n = 1544). HSP (56.9%) and Kawasaki disease (24%) were
major groups. The study revealed that primary vasculitides
were diagnosed in 135 patients (male:female ratio was 1.9:1
and the mean age of onset was 5.5 years). Among the 38 cases
of Kawasaki disease, 20 had coronary artery involvement,
5 had persistent aneurysms, 29 received IVIG, non required
angioplasty. Other vasculitides included PAN (n = 4),
Wegener’s granulomatosis (n = 2), and Takayasu disease
(n = 1). Secondary vasculitis accounted for 23 cases.

CONCLUSION
Pediatric vasculitis is a challenging disease for diagnosis as
well as treatment. It should be considered whenever there is
unexplained multisystem disease with evidence of vascular
involvement. Fever, extreme irritability, hypertension,
hematuria, and skin lesions are some of the important clues
for diagnosis. Other organs, such as the eye, peripheral
nervous system and the kidneys, must be examined to pick up
asymptomatic involvement. Prompt and aggressive treatment
can prevent complications and decrease the morbidity and
mortality in pediatric populations.

119

Kawasaki Disease
Anju Gupta

INTRODUCTION
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic medium vessel
vasculitis with strong predilection to childhood. Since its
first description in early 1960s by Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki,
this disease continues to remain enigmatic. What makes this
disease so are factors like our inability to identify an etiologic
agent, absence of a specific diagnostic test in acute phase,
and our inability to predict cardiac complications. Moreover,
clinical features often appear transiently and the examining
physician may not be able to see all the characteristic clinical
features at a time. Now, this disease has been described
worldwide with a distinct predilection for Japanese descent.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Japan has a maximum incidence of KD with rates of
240/100,000 children less than 5 years. Korea and Taiwan have
reported the next high incidences. Whereas, the incidence in
the United States (20 per 100,000 children of less than 5 years)
is static over the years, Japan has been reporting increasing
incidence rates over the years. A distinct seasonal predilection
is seen in extratropical Northern hemisphere with maximum
cases seen in January to March with a nadir from August to
October. However, a similar seasonal predilection is not
consistently described in tropics.

ETIOLOGY
Etiology of KD remains elusive and likely involves an
environmental agent in presence of certain genetic factors. A
ubiquitous environmental agent has been implicated because
of distinct seasonality, occurrence of epidemics, occurrence
of rash-like in toxin mediated diseases, and efficacy of
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). Genetic factors also have
been implicated because of strong racial predilection seen in
Japanese descent.

PATHOGENESIS
Kawasaki disease is characterized by intensive T cell
stimulation with activation of inflammatory cytokines and
leukocyte recruitment. Activation of T cell may be responsible
for Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) site activation seen
so frequently in this disease. This leads to upregulation of
proteolytic activity causing elastin degradation and vessel
wall damage, which is responsible for characteristic coronary
lesions seen in this disease.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Characteristic clinical features of KD include fever, poly­
morphous exanthem, bilateral conjunctival congestion,
changes in extremities, changes in lips and oral cavity, and
cervical adenopathy. Fever is typically high grade (>39°C)
with an abrupt onset and responds transiently to antipyretics.
Usually, fever persists for more than 5 days (median 11 days)
and can persist for more than 3 weeks, if not treated. There
is usually a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash which
usually appears within first 5 days of illness. Conjunctivitis is
typically bilateral, nonexudative, and spares limbus (Fig. 1).
Changes in extremities include diffuse nonpitting edema on
the dorsum of hands and feet and characteristic periungual
desquamation starting in late second or third week of illness
(Figs 2 and 3). Perianal desquamation is also characteristic
and usually precedes periungual desquamation (Fig. 4).
Changes in lips and oral cavity include strawberry tongue
(Fig. 5) and cracking of lips. Cervical adenopathy is usually
single, unilateral, and nontender and involves anterior
cervical chain.
Besides these clinical features described in American
Heart Association criteria (Box 1), lots of other clinical
features may be present and may help or confuse treating
physician further. Irritability is usually extreme in infants to
the extent that clinician may think of pyogenic meningitis.

SECTION 14: Rheumatology

Fig. 6: Prominent Beau’s lines

Fig. 7: Coronary aneurysms on echocardiography

Aseptic meningitis is common in KD and responds briskly
to intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). We have seen
significant joint manifestations in children with KD. These may
include arthralgia and arthritis which could involve both large
and small joints. Significant right hypochondriac pain can
occur due to hydrops of gallbladder. Hepatic dysfunction with
conjugated jaundice and transaminitis can lead to a diagnosis
of viral hepatitis. Reactivation of BCG site with erythema
and induration can be a helpful sign. Rarely, respiratory
complications in the form of pulmonary nodules, interstitial
infiltrates, pleural effusions, and pneumothorax can occur.
Cranial nerve palsies, anterior uveitis, myocarditis, valvular
regurgitation, and peripheral gangrene are other rarely
described manifestations. Beau’s lines are frequently seen in
convalescent phase (Fig. 6).

usually not seen in first week of illness. There could be other
suggestive findings in echocardiography like perivascular
brightness, lack of tapering of vessels, low ejection fraction,
mitral regurgitation, and pericardial effusion. These findings
may be useful in diagnosis especially in those infants where all
the clinical features are not present (incomplete KD). A repeat
echocardiography at 6–8 weeks of illness is useful in picking up
coronary abnormalities and guiding further treatment.

INVESTIGATIONS

586

None of the investigations are diagnostic in acute phase of
KD. Thrombocytosis which is described as characteristic
feature of KD is not seen before the end of second week
and hence, is not useful in making a decision regarding
treatment. Acute phase is associated with various markers
of inflammation which include neutrophilia, high erythro­
cyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high C-reactive protein (CRP),
anemia, hypoalbuminemia, sterile pyuria (due to uretheritis),
and transaminitis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may reveal
pleocytosis. In children with arthritis, there may be synovial
fluid pleocytosis. Thrombocytopenia has been described in a
small minority of patients at onset and has been attributed to
increased adherence of platelets to activated endothelium or
to disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Echocardiography is an important tool and is usually
done at baseline and then after 6–8 weeks of illness (Fig. 7).
Another echocardiography may be needed in second week of
illness in children who do not show response to IVIG. Coronary
dilatation is described as Z scores of more than or equal to
2.5 for internal diameters for both left anterior descending
and right coronary arteries. However, coronary dilatation is

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Since the clinical features are relatively nonspecific, there are
many differential diagnoses of KD (Box 2). These include viral
infections (measles, adenovirus, enterovirus, Epstein-Barr
virus), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxin mediated syndromes,
scarlet fever, leptospirosis, and hypersensitivity reactions
to drugs. Exudative pharyngitis, exudative conjunctivitis,
discrete intraoral lesions, bullous or vesicular rash, and diffuse
lymphadenopathy suggest another diagnosis. Scarlet fever
usually is not associated with conjunctivitis and shows a brisk
response to antibiotics. Visceral involvement and hypotension
are frequent in toxin mediated syndromes.
Box 2: Differential diagnosis
• Viral infections (measles,
adenovirus, enterovirus,
Epstein-Barr virus)
• Stevens-Johnson syndrome

• Toxin mediated syndromes
• Scarlet fever
• Leptospirosis

Clinical Pearls
Think of another diagnosis in presence of:
• Exudative pharyngitis
• Exudative conjunctivitis
• Discrete intraoral lesions
• Bullous or vesicular rash
• Diffuse lymphadenopathy.

CHAPTER 119: Kawasaki Disease

TREATMENT
Standard treatment of KD involves administration of IVIg
and aspirin. It is better to wait for a day or two if one is seeing
the child for the first time on day 4 or 5 of illness and clinical
features are not clear-cut. This duration helps in evolution of
disease signs as well as in evaluation of response to empirical
antibiotics.
Intravenous immunoglobulins: IVIg is usually given at a dose
of 2 g/kg as a single dose infusion. Single dose infusion has
been found to be more effective than divided dose infusions.
Most patients show a brisk response to IVIg with defervescence
and general well-being. Inflammatory parameters also show
gradual improvement. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not
useful in evaluating response as high ESR continues to be seen
after administration of IVIg.
However, 10–15% patients show IVIg resistance which
is described as persistence or recrudescence of fever after
36 hours of completion of IVIg infusion. This is important to
identify as this is the most important clinical feature associated
with high risk of coronary abnormalities (Box 3). One or two
fever spikes during or immediately after IVIg infusion are
common and should not be labeled as IVIg resistance.
Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy has been shown to
reduce the risk of coronary abnormalities from 25 to 3–5%, if
given within first 10 days of illness. Beyond the first 10 days,
the benefit is not so great; however, most clinicians would give
IVIg even beyond 10 days if the child is febrile and continues
to have high inflammatory parameters. It has also been seen
that the children who receive IVIg within first 5 days of illness
are more likely to need additional therapy. Whether this is due
to more inflammation per se and hence, more severe disease
is not very clear.
Aspirin: aspirin is routinely used as first line therapy along
with IVIG. Use of aspirin has not been shown either to reduce
the coronary risk or the time to defervescence. Usually antiinflammatory doses in the range of 80–100 mg/kg/day are
used till subsidence of inflammation. However, because of
significant gastrointestinal toxicity, lower doses in the range of
30–50 mg/kg/day are being used frequently nowadays. Once
the child is afebrile and inflammatory parameters (CRP) show
declining trend, dose of aspirin can be reduced to antiplatelet
doses (1–5 mg/kg/day). Aspirin is discontinued if the follow-up

echocardiography at 6–8 weeks is normal. In all other children,
aspirin may be needed for longer duration.
About 85% children show response to IVIg and aspirin
(Algorithm 1). Rest of the children may need additional
therapy. There is no consensus on the second line treatment
in KD; some centers use an additional dose of IVIg whereas
others use tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Of late, there has
been resurgence in usage of corticosteroids in IVIg resistant
KD despite initial reports showing contradictory results.

PROGNOSIS
In the pre-IVIg era, about 25% children would go on to develop
coronary abnormalities. Use of IVIg has reduced this risk
to 3–5%. Coronary abnormalities can persist as ectasia or
aneurysms which can be saccular, fusiform, or segmental.
These aneurysms carry a significant risk of rupture, thrombosis
and stenosis, and predispose the individual to ischemic events.
Hence, all patients who develop coronary abnormalities
should continue to be on lifelong follow-up programs. These
children also need long-term aspirin in antiplatelet doses.
Those with giant aneurysms (>8 mm or Z scores >4) have
higher risk of complications. Addition of warfarin or heparin
to aspirin in such patients has been shown to reduce risk of
thrombosis and lead to better event-free survival. Peripheral
artery involvement can occur in KD, however, is uncommon in
the absence of coronary artery involvement.

CONCLUSION
Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis which can
mimic a myriad of childhood illnesses. Importance of timely
recognition and management is important as it reduces the
risk of coronary complications to a significant extent. No
single diagnostic test is useful in the acute phase. Intravenous
immunoglobulins along with aspirin are the standard of care,
and most patients respond briskly to this treatment.

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura
Anand P Rao

INTRODUCTION
Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common
childhood vasculitis with an annual incidence of 20.4 per
100,000 population less than 17 years. It is characterized by
leukocytoclastic vasculitis histopathologically. It commonly
affects children between 5 and 15 years of age. About 50%
cases are reported in less than 5 years and 75% cases in less
than 10 years of age. It occurs most frequently between the
ages of 3 and 15 years and is slightly more common in boys
than in girls (1.5:1).
It commonly affects the small vessels of the skin, joints,
gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. It is generally a self-limited
condition, but rarely can be associated with complicated
chronic course.

ETIOPATHOGENESIS
Henoch-Schönlein purpura is thought to be an immuno­
globulin A (IgA) mediated dysregulated immune process
with probable involvement of alternate complement pathway
caused by as yet unknown etiological agent.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Constitutional: it may be associated with low grade fever and
malaise.
Cutaneous: predominant lower limb purpura with involve­
ment of buttocks, upper limbs, face, and very rarely, the trunk
is the classical feature of this condition. The rashes can range
from petechiae to ecchymosis to hemorrhagic bullae. Edema
of the dorsal surfaces of feet, hands, scrotum, scalp, and face
may sometimes be seen. Presence of palpable purpura is a sine
qua non for the diagnosis of HSP (Fig. 1).
Gastrointestinal manifestations: it is seen in about 70% of
patients. It can precede the purpura in about 14–46% of the
patients but mostly happens in the first week of the onset of the

Fig. 1: Predominant lower purpura in an adolescent girl

disease. Vasculitis of the bowel wall can lead to intussusception,
gangrene, and perforation of the bowel wall.

Clinical Pearl
• Please keep in mind Henoch-Schönlein purpura in any child
who presents with acute abdominal pain and look for rashes
over the lower limbs before involving the surgeon.

Genitourinary involvement: it more often than not determines
the outcome of the disease. The manifestations can range from
microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria to nephrotic
syndrome, acute nephritic syndrome, hyper­tension, or renal
failure. The renal manifestations have been reported to be
seen in about 40% of patients and about 1–3% of the patient’s
progress to an end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Acute pain in

SECTION 14: Rheumatology
the scrotum can sometimes bring the child to medical attention
and might indicate testicular ischemia.

•

Clinical Pearl

•

• The nephritis in Henoch-Schönlein purpura can be silent.
It is important to look for it by checking the blood pressure,
urine routine, and microscopy weekly for at least 3 months
from onset of disease. Serum creatinine should be checked at
baseline.

Arthritis: large joints like knee, ankle, wrist, and elbow seem
to be involved in this condition. It may precede the rashes
occasionally. It tends to be transient and may last from a few
days to a few weeks. Arthritis rarely goes on for months.
The diagnosis of HSP is based on the classification criteria
proposed by EULAR/PRINTO/PRES.
Purpura (mandatory criterion): purpura (commonly palpable
and in crops) or petechiae, with lower limb predominance. At
least one of the following criteria is required for the diagnosis
of HSP:
• Abdominal pain: diffuse abdominal colicky pain with acute
onset assessed by history and physical examination. It may
include intussusception and gastrointestinal bleeding
• Histopathology: typically leukocytoclastic vasculitis with
predominant IgA deposits or proliferative glomerulo­
nephritis with predominant IgA deposits
• Arthritis or arthralgia: arthritis of acute onset defined
as joint swelling or joint pain with limitation of motion.
Arthralgia of acute onset defined as joint pain without joint
swelling or limitation of motion
• Renal involvement: proteinuria more than 0.3 g/24 hours
or more than 20 mg/mmol of urine albumin/creatinine
ratio on a spot morning sample. Hematuria or red blood
cell casts: more than 5 red blood cells/high power field or
red blood cells.
The following factors that are thought to be associated with
severe renal disease:
• Age more than 7 years of age
• Severe gastrointestinal disease as manifested by severe
abdominal pain or bloody stools
• Persistent or recurrent skin disease.
The cumulative proportion of patients with HSP developing
HSP nephritis by 1 month is 85%, by 2 months is 90%, and by
6 months is 97%, respectively. It has been suggested that all
patients should have urine routine microscopy examination
once a week for 3 months and for 6 months in those with
evidence of nephritis or recurrent purpura.

Skin biopsy is indicated in incomplete or atypical HSP.
It reveals leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving dermal
capillaries and postcapillary venules with IgA deposition
Imaging like ultrasonography might be required in patients
with severe abdominal pain to rule out intussusception.

Clinical Pearl
• Serum immunoglobulin A levels are not useful for the diagnosis
of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) as they are elevated only
in 50% of patients with HSP.

TREATMENT
•
•
•

Rest
Hydration
Paracetamol/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for
analgesia
• Steroids indicated in the following conditions:
{{ Orchitis
{{ Severe gastrointestinal disease and hemorrhage
{{ Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (prophylactic
steroid therapy has no role in preventing onset of
nephritis).
The steroid regimen recommended for severe extrarenal
manifestations and renal manifestations of HSP is 1 mg/kg for
2 weeks followed by gradual taper over the subsequent 2 weeks
time. The diagnosis and management of HSP has been outlined
in algorithm 1.

SUGGESTED READINGS

Two-thirds of patients get better by 4 weeks. But, one-third of
patients can have recurrences, commonly manifesting as rash
and abdominal pain and tends to be milder than the previous
one. Prognostic features which portend poor outcome are:
• Severe gastrointestinal manifestations
• Frequent skin rashes
• Severe renal manifestation at onset.
Less than 5% of patients progress to ESRD. Those with
clinical nephritis should be closely followed up for at least
5 years.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
Suma Balan

INTRODUCTION
Acquired connective tissue disorders in children are a group
of conditions among which the most common is systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE). This is a disease of immune
dysregulation where the immune system appears to be
activated with the formation of autoantibodies to a wide
variety of antinuclear antigens and the formation of immune
complexes which can affect any organ, thus, creating a
multisystem illness which can damage any organ in the body
if left untreated long term.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Worldwide SLE has an incidence between 20–150/100,000.
Most prevalence studies come from developed world literature
where comparing the incidence between various ethnic
minorities shows a significantly higher incidence in Asian/
Afro-Caribbean and Oriental population compared to the
white/Caucasian population. The incidence in children has
been quoted between 4–250/100,000 depending upon race
and location.
Approximately 20% of SLE commences in childhood,
before 18 years of age. The most common age of onset is
during teenage coinciding with puberty; however, it can occur
at any age. It is very uncommon to present below 5 years of
age. In prepubertal children, the boy:girl ratio is almost equal
(4:3), but postpubertal children show a significant girl to boy
dominance of 4:1.
There are no clear described prevalence figures for SLE in
the Indian population.

DIAGNOSIS OF SYSTEMIC
LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
Like tuberculosis (TB) and syphilis, SLE is considered as one
of the great mimics in medicine owing to its widely variable
presentation, multisystem involvement, and the diagnosis,

especially in the absence of the classic malar rash can be very
confusing. A series of clinical and laboratory criteria have
been set out with mainly toward standardization for research
purposes, but generally the presence in four criteria even over
a longitudinal manner contribute toward making a diagnosis.
They have greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity toward
the diagnosis; however, it is equally essential that obsessive
use of the criteria alone is not essential toward making the
diagnosis (Table 1).

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Systemic lupus erythematosus can present as a chronic slowly
progressing low grade illness with troublesome skin, joint and
constitutional symptoms, as a subacute illness with internal
organ involvement or even as an acute florid illness with
catastrophic presentations like renal failure, strokes, major
thrombosis, etc.
As it is capable of involving every organ, the clinical features
are myriad and difficult to outline all possible presentations.
There are several children who are initially diagnosed as
Henoch-Schonlein purpura or idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura who turn out to have SLE. Again, children with existing
autoimmune disease as in autoimmune hypothyroidism or
autoimmune hemolytic anemia might over the course of time
develop a second autoimmune illness like SLE.

WORKUP
Once SLE is suspected, the following multisystem assessment
should be carried out.

Fig. 1: Oral ulcer on hard palate in systemic lupus erythematosus

•
•

•
•

Skin: a biopsy can often be confirmatory especially if a
second sample is also sent for immunofluorescence
Eyes: retinopathy and vasculitis of the retina can be
frequently associated and a professional ophthalmological
examination must be undertaken in all children
Blood: check for hematological manifestations. Baseline
clotting tests with prolongation of activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT) are strongly suggestive of the
presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. A differential
diagnosis for a child presenting with constitutional
symptoms and pancytopenia/bicytopenia is SLE and the
presence of lymphopenia on the white blood cell count is a
clue as opposed to neutropenia in childhood hematological
malignancies
Renal: check serum albumin and a routine urine
examination in all children—the presence of active urinary
sediment is indicative of nephritis. If edema, hypertension,
oliguria, etc. are present, be alert to a proliferative nephritis
and work-up has to be prioritized toward a biopsy to aid
early treatment
Musculoskeletal system: often more symptoms and signs
and rarely erosive arthritis. Muscle enzymes may be
elevated
Central nervous system: observe mood and sleep patterns
and be alert to cognitive changes or seizures. Baseline
scans, electroencephalogram are not warranted unless
clinical concern exists
Pulmonary: observe clinical changes
A chest X-ray will reveal the presence of pleural effusion/
pneumonitis, etc. One needs to be cautious to distinguish
between active disease and secondary infection that can
present with similar signs. A serum C-reactive protein
is rarely elevated in active SLE and is often a good
marker to distinguish active disease and intercurrent
sepsis. Tuberculosis can present with similar features
and prior to commencement of immunosuppressive
therapy, it is recommended to check a Mantoux and
other tests as required—lymph node biopsy if significant

lymphadenopathy, etc. to rule out the presence of latent or

In the presence of significant pneumonitis or pulmonary
vasculitis, a high resolution computed tomography scan of
the chest may be required to delineate the detailed changes
present. Children can present with acute respiratory
deterioration, hypoxia, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
must be suspected if ground glass picture of lungs noted.
Hemoptysis may not be present externally and the child can
develop acute pallor in this setting. Equally, a pulmonary
embolism can also cause acute respiratory deterioration
and hypoxia
Central nervous system: pericardial effusion at
presentation is not uncommon. Myocarditis due to SLE
carries a grave prognosis if not recognized early and treated
with aggressive immunosuppression. Endocarditis with
large valve deposits (traditionally known as Libman-Sacks
endocarditis) is rare. The author has seen two children with
coronary arterial dilatations and aneurysms akin to the
picture in Kawasaki who presented with cardiac failure at
presentation
Abdomen: SLE can present with a picture of hepatitis, hepatosplenomegaly and ascites, abdominal lymphadenopathy, etc. Acute abdominal pain in SLE needs attention as
can be rarely due to pancreatitis, mesenteric vasculitis, or
mesenteric thrombosis or even renal vein thrombosis and
these conditions need to be addressed very urgently.

Clinical Pearl
• Along with making the diagnosis, describing the extent of
involvement is also important

INVESTIGATIONS
•
•
•
•
•

•

•

•

Complete blood count: anemia—usually direct Coombs
test/cold agglutinin positive
White blood cell: leukopenia with lymphopenia
A child with SLE presenting with fever and a neutrophilic
count must be assessed for the presence of secondary
infection
Platelet counts (often reduced) rarely below 50,000/mm3
When significant pancytopenia is present with high fever,
always consider the possibility of macrophage activation
syndrome due to uncontrolled inflammation from
active disease and look for the necessary parameters in
biochemical testing and bone marrow examination may be
helpful
Inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate
often elevated significantly in disease activity. C-reactive
protein is rarely elevated in active lupus disease—unless
in presence of active pleural and pericardial effusions
or synovitis with effusions. C-reactive protein can be
considered a good marker for detecting secondary bacterial
infection in a child with SLE, a condition that needs to be
addressed urgently
Baseline renal function tests: liver function tests must be
done in every patient. A low serum albumin can be part
of active inflammation as well as indicate proliferative
nephritis or hepatic disease
A detailed urine routine examination with examination of
the urinary sediment has to be done for every patient. The
presence of proteinuria/active sediment should lead to
quantification of proteinuria by 24 hours urinary protein
estimation or a random spot urinary protein/creatinine
ratio.

Immunological Testing
Antinuclear Antibody Test
The antinuclear antibody (ANA) screening is advised by
immuno­
fluorescence rather than the more commonly or
cheaper mode of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) testing. Immunofluorescence yields a titer and has
both qualitative and quantitative enumeration with less
false positivity and greater reliability than the ELISA test. It
is important to know that presence of ANA positivity does
not imply SLE—the ANA can be falsely positive in normal
individuals, common infective, and other inflammatory
conditions as well as other autoimmune diseases. The clinical
strength of a suspicion of SLE or the pretest probability of a
patient to have lupus makes the positive ANA more diagnostic.
However, a negative ANA (by immunofluorescence) with
today’s techniques is more than enough to rule out a diagnosis

of lupus in the vast majority of patients. No single titer is
diagnostic though titers of 1:1,280 or greater are less associated
with false positives.

Clinical Pearls
• All that is antinuclear antibody positive is not systemic lupus
erythematosus
• The pretest probability (clinical suspicion) increases the
diagnostic yield of the immunological testing
• Antinuclear antibody screen is for diagnosis and does not need
repeating.

If ANA is positive, the serum complements have to be
estimated as hypocomplementemia is a feature of disease
activity. The anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid
(anti-dsDNA) is the most common antibody associated with
SLE and can be estimated qualitatively by immunofluorescence
and quantitatively by ELISA. A quantitative estimation
is recommended since these levels and those of serum
complements are used for disease monitoring. The ANA
profile estimates the presence of other extractable antinuclear
antibodies like the ribo­
nucleoproteins (anti-RNP), the Sm
and the Ro (anti-SSA), and La (anti-SSB) and antihistone
levels. Many of these antibodies remain positive and are
used more for diagnosis rather than monitoring, so they need
not be repeated. Various antibodies are related to system
manifestations in SLE e.g., anti-dSDNA and Sm for nephritis
and anti-RNP for neuropsychiatric disease.
All patients suspected/diagnosed to have SLE should
have their antiphospholipid antibody testing done. The
presence of a prolonged APTT/Prothrombin time gives a
clue to the presence of these antibodies. The serum levels of
anticardiolipin-immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM, the lupus
anticoagulant and the anti-b-lipoprotein 1 (IgG and IgM) are
the ones tested.

Tissue Diagnosis
Skin biopsy can be done to make the diagnosis—the histo­
pathological appearances are characteristic as well as
immunofluorescence showing “full-house” deposition of IgG/
IgM/IgA/C3/C1q.
Lymph node biopsy may pick up Kikuchi-like changes
or a paracortical hyperplasia. Depending on the clinical
presentation, the presentation of a significant lymph­
adenopathy in the background of a pyrexia of unknown origin
presentation may necessitate a lymph node biopsy to rule out
differentials like TB or lymphoma.

Renal Biopsy
A renal biopsy with histologic, immunofluorescent, and
electron micrographic analysis (where available) is necessary
to classify the histologic type of renal disease. In our country,
electron microscopy is very expensive with very limited
availability, hence, not routinely requested.
Renal biopsy is rarely done to make a diagnosis of SLE or
lupus nephritis which is often already decided by this time;

595

SECTION 14: Rheumatology
however, it is to ascertain the class of nephritis which can then
guide the level of treatment.
The International Society of Nephrology and the Renal
Pathology Society have revised the original World Health
Organization classification of renal biopsy findings in SLE into
six different classes.
• Class 1 is generally considered minimal change and needs
no treatment
• Class 2 is mesangioproliferative and needs no additional
treatment to steroids for a few months as would likely be
used for background systemic disease
• Class 3 (focal proliferative) and 4 (diffuse proliferative)
are proliferative and the most common presentations.
This class of patients commonly present with proteinuria/
nephritis, hematuria, hypertension, and some azotemia.
Patients may change from one class to another either
before or during treatment. These classes of patients are
meant to be treated aggressively to recruit back as many
nephrons to normal activity and degree of reversibility
makes timely and appropriately aggressive therapy very
important in these patients
• Class 5 is called membranous nephropathy and often
presents as a nephrotic syndrome with the ongoing issues
of anasarca. It can also be associated with proliferation
which indicates aggressive management compared to pure
membranous change which is controlled by antiedma
measures and lower levels of immunosuppression
• Class 6 or advanced glomerular sclerosis when >90% of
glomeruli are sclerosed, dictates poor renal prognosis and
need for renal replacement therapy and a transplant.

TREATMENT OF
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS
The treatment of SLE can be divided into:
1. General measures
2. Specific measures.

General Measures
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Use of sunscreen of sun protection factor 30+ to exposed
body areas when going out in sun
Ensuring activity and exercise and preventative measures
toward good cardiovascular health
Maintenance of weight and body mass index in healthy
zone
Intake of nutritious healthy varied diet unless specific
restriction advised
Medication compliance
Regular follow-up as advised
Hydroxychloroquine is now recommended to be
continued indefinitely for all children with SLE to improve
cardiovascular health and stabilization of antiphospholipid
antibodies.

Specific Measures
596

The pharmacological management depends on level of disease
activity and severity of internal organ involvement.

Mild lupus: largely characterized by musculoskeletal
symptoms, and signs, mild systemic symptoms and mild
hematological manifestations. A combination of low dose
steroids and hydroxychloroquine (up to 6 mg/kg/day) may be
all that is required.
Moderate lupus: some systemic symptoms, moderate degree of
hematological, and some internal organ affectation. Moderate
dose of steroids 0.5–1 g/kg/day weaned slowly over 3–6 months
with hydroxychloroquine and often second line agents like
methotrexate/azathioprine may be needed.
Severe lupus: with severe internal organ involvement, lupus
nephritis, neuropsychiatric manifestations, macrophage
activation syndrome, etc. are seen. High dose pulsed
intra­
venous steroids (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone to a
maximum dose of 1 g/day for 3 days) followed by high dose
oral steroids—1–2 mg/kg/day initially in divided doses
moving to single dose over 2 weeks and then a very slow
wean is essential in the management of these patients. After
appropriate assessment, there is a need for early consideration
of a secondary agent in the form of mycofenolate mofetil or
intravenous cyclophosphamide (intravenous pulse/month
for 6 months). In nonrenal systemic severe lupus like neuro­
psychiatric/lung etc., cyclophosphamide has better results
than mycophenolate mofetil.
Catastrophic lupus; e.g., pancreatitis, diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage, severe neuropsychiatric manifestation, gangrene,
etc.—high dose steroids intravenous cyclophos­phamide have
to be commenced early. Intravenous immunoglobulin 2 g/kg
over 1 day, 2 days in divided doses or divided over 5 days has
also been very helpful in serious emergencies with SLE.
Overall, the management is targeted toward seriousness
of disease manifestations and balanced between controling
active disease, preventing organ damage due to disease
and damage, and morbidity due to treatment itself. All
medications used in SLE have significant potential toxicity
and administration and care should be under the supervision
of a rheumatologist. Currently, the management of SLE solely
with long duration of systemic steroids alone is discouraged
due to problems with long-term steroid usage. Rituximab,
an anti-CD20, monoclonal antibody is gaining preference
in the management of refractory or resistant manifestations
of SLE and may become part of the primary protocol for the
management of proliferative lupus nephritis in the future.

Counseling
Counseling the family and the patient about the diagnosis
of SLE is very important. The family and patient need to
understand that it is a chronic lifelong disease. However, there
can be periods of activity and inactivity and inactive periods
can often last very long durations. Hydroxychloroquine is
now recommended for indefinite use (and 6–12 monthly eye
assessments with Humphrey Field Analyzer assessments
are very important). Along with the medication, the need for
regular follow-up and disease monitoring is very important.
Pregnancy and fertility are specific areas that need very careful
counseling and a rheumatologist has to remain part of the loop

CHAPTER 121: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
from the advice of planning pregnancy through the pregnancy
and delivery. Medications have to be explained with awareness
of potential side effects. The relationship between the
rheumatologist and the patient and family is very important to
the patients overall improvement and well-being.

Approach to
Juvenile Dermatomyositis
Deepti Suri, Sagar Bhattad

INTRODUCTION
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an uncommon inflam­
matory myositis, characterized by a proximal muscle weakness,
a heliotrope rash, and Gottron papules over the knuckles and
elbows. It can involve several other organ systems like the
gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and heart. Lipodystrophy with
insulin resistant diabetes is also a well-known association with
this condition.
The primary lesion in JDM is a small vessel vasculopathy
of varying severity. Unlike adults, in whom polymyositis (PM),
inclusion body myositis, and cancer associated myositis are
common causes of inflammatory myopathy; JDM is the most
common inflammatory myopathy in children. In the presteroid era, one-third children died, one-third recovered,
and one-third of those who survived had significant residual
problems of contractures and muscle atrophy. Over the last
few decades, survival and outcome has improved considerably
with aggressive immunosuppressive therapies. Mortality rate
in children in the West is reported to be less than 3%. However,
JDM is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality
in our setting.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Classical JDM, as the name suggests, involves skin along
with proximal muscle weakness. Characteristic cutaneous
abnormalities are seen in 75% of patients. These include
erythematous violaceous heliotrope rash seen over the upper
eyelids, Gottron papules symmetrical shiny, erythematous,
scaly papules noted over extensor surfaces of small joints,
and wrist and elbows (Fig. 1). Nailfold capillaroscopy reveals
periungual erythema and capillary loop abnormalities which
are pathognomonic and correlates with the disease severity.
Classical JDM presents with insidious progression of
malaise, easy fatigue, muscle weakness, fever, and rash that may
predate diagnosis by 3–6 months. Muscle weakness at onset is
predominantly proximal and children most commonly present
with involvement of musculature of hip girdle. Involvement
of anterior neck flexors leads to inability to hold head upright
and is an important finding pointing toward the diagnosis of
JDM. Pharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and palatal muscles are
frequently affected, resulting in difficulty in swallowing, nasal
regurgitation of feeds, and nasal twang to the voice. Weak gag
reflex increases the risks of aspiration pneumonias. Although,

DEFINITION
Traditionally, the diagnosis of JDM is based on Bohan and
Peters criteria or Rider Taggoff criteria. The diagnosis is
essentially clinical and with the advent of muscle magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), very few rheumatologist obtain
electromyographs, or muscle biopsies unless the diagnosis is
in doubt.

EPIDEMOLOGY
Incidence of JDM is reported to be 3.2 children/million/year
and girls are more commonly affected than the boys. Onset is
between 4–10 years, with average age at onset being 7 years.
However, 25% of children have onset before 4 years of age.

Fig. 1: Juvenile dermatomyositis. Erythematous, scaly papules noted
over extensor surfaces of small joints, and wrist and elbows

CHAPTER 122: Approach to Juvenile Dermatomyositis
muscle weakness may be impressive, the deep tendon reflexes
are usually preserved.

Clinical Pearl
• Weakness of anterior flexor muscles of the neck is important
early indicator of inflammatory myositis.

Diagnosis is rather clinical and certain in presence of
pathognomonic dermatological findings and proximal muscle
weakness. However, some children present with atypical
features like subcutaneous tissue edema and can be confused
with nephritic syndrome and other causes of anasarca. Some
children demonstrate exquisite muscle tenderness and refusal
to walk or bear weight. Close looks for the dermatological
features help differentiate it from viral myositis. Transient
nondeforming arthritis may also occasionally occur. However,
presence of significant and persistent arthritis in a child with
JDM should suggest the possibility of an overlap syndrome
such as mixed connective tissue disorder.
Juvenile dermatomyositis sine myositis or amyopathic
dermatomyositis: it is characterized by only the skin
manifestations and paucity of muscle involvement and is
relatively rare in childhood. Whether these children develop
clinical overt myositis at follow-up is unclear, although
some studies report up to 26% of children do, when followed
for about 4 or more years. In contrast to adult amyopathic
dermatomyositis, interstitial lung disease or internal
malignancy has not been reported from pediatric cases,
and thus this subgroup carries good prognosis in children.
Magnetic resonance imaging is said to be a sensitive modality
for detection of muscle abnormalities in patients with
amyopathic dermatomyositis.
Juvenile dermatomyositis with associated rheumatic
diseases: a subset of children with JDM may have features
of other rheumatic diseases as well. If children present
with features of any two of the following diseases—juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
systemic scleroderma, and JDM—one should consider
mixed connective tissue disease. Manifestations develop
sequentially, but not in any predictable order, although
majority would have the rash of SLE or JDM at the onset. Anti
U1Anti-U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins antibodies are
characteristically elevated.

COMPLICATIONS

Pulmonary involvement can occur in the form of interstitial
lung disease, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonias,
and rarely pneumothorax and other air leak syndromes.
During the convalescence phase late complications
like calcinosis and lipodystrophy are recognized. They have
been linked to poor management of the disease at the initial
presentation and also corroborate well with the severity of
the first presentation. Calcinosis occurs in 10–40% of JDM
patients and are extremely disfiguring. Calcinosis affecting
subcutaneous tissues may result in cellulitis and painful
superficial ulceration of overlying skin. Flexion contractures
may occur when these occur across joints.
Lipodystrophy is usually associated with series of meta­
bolic derangements like insulin resistance, glucose intolerance
and hyper­triglyceridemia, and lipid abnormalities. Hirsutism
and prominent dilated peripheral veins are also seen in some
patients.

Clinical Pearl
• Calcinosis is a late complication seen in patient with poor
initial immunosuppressive therapy.

INVESTIGATIONS
Indicators of inflammation (thrombocytosis, elevated erythro­
cyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein) correlate
with the degree of inflammation and help to differentiate
inflammatory myopathies from non­inflammatory disorders
like muscular dystrophy.

Muscle Enzymes
Serum levels of muscle enzymes are important for
diagnosis and for monitoring patients of JDM on therapy.
Aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine kinase (CK), lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase should be measures
at baseline. Aspartate aminotransferase or CK may be
elevated 20–40 times normal. However, it is to be noted that
occasionally, CK levels may be normal, particularly with a
longer duration of untreated disease. Lactate dehydrogenase
appears to correlate best with measures of disease activity.
Serum levels of all muscle enzymes usually decrease 3–4 weeks
before improvement in muscle strength and rise 5–6 weeks
before clinical relapse. As a general rule, CK levels return to
normal first (usually several weeks after instituting therapy);
and aldolase and LDH levels return to normal the last.

Vasculopathy results in many systemic complications in JDM.
Gastrointestinal vasculitis and mesenteric ischemia can lead
to acute gastrointestinal hemorrhages, intestinal perforation,
and even mortality. Abdominal pain, therefore, must never be
neglected in patients with JDM as this could be the earliest clue
to gastrointestinal vasculitis.

Clinical Pearl
• Abdominal pain in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis
may be the earliest clue to intestinal vasculopathy.

SECTION 14: Rheumatology

Autoantibodies
Antinuclear antibodies may be positive in 10–85%. Myositis
specific antibodies like anti-Jo-1 are uncommon in pediatric
population and occur only in about 10% of children with JDM.
Anti-PM/Scl is associated with overlap syndrome.

ALGORITHM 1
Basic diagnostic algorithm for diagnosis of juvenile
dermatomyositis

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging has dramatically replaced the
need for muscle biopsy for the diagnosis of JDM. The T2weighted magnetic resonance image with fat suppression
demonstrates muscle edema and inflammatory changes by a
hyperintense signal. magnetic resonance also helps in guiding
the extent of disease and also helps in selecting a site for
muscle biopsy.

Electromyography
Electromyography findings that suggest inflammatory myopathy
include a combination of changes of myopathy and denervation.

Muscle Biopsy
Muscle biopsy is largely performed when the diagnosis is
in doubt, if there are no skin findings and sometimes to
evaluate the disease activity. It may occasionally help in
making alternative diagnosis in children who fail trial of
immunosuppression.
Biopsy usually is performed from quadriceps or deltoid,
although the best specimen may be chosen based on
electomyography or MRI. Muscle biopsy reveals perifascicular
atrophy and variations in fiber size, as an outcome to ongoing
degeneration and regeneration. Areas of focal necrosis would
be noted and inflammatory exudates are often presented.

TREATMENT
Morbidity and mortality have greatly reduced over the decades
as a result of effective immunosuppressive therapies. Use
of high dose corticosteroids early in the disease course has
dramatically improved prognosis. Treatment regimen consists
of high dose oral corticosteroids (up to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone)
with a slow tapering regimen, often over a minimum of 2 years.
Intravenous pulse methyl prednisolone (30 mg/kg/dose) for
3–5 doses are administered at the onset of therapy in some
children with severe inflammation and marked weakness.
Majority of the children are also initiated on alternative
immunosuppressive drugs, like methotrexate (15 mg/m2
subcutaneous weekly) along with folic acid as steroid sparing
agents. Children who fail to respond to these, second line agents
including intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide,
mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and rituximab can be
tried. Supportive care with graded physiotherapy and skin care
are of utmost importance.

Acute Osteoarticular Infections
Jasodhara Chaudhuri, Tapas K Sabui

INTRODUCTION
Acute osteoarticular infections (AOI) are prominent areas
of bacterial infection in infancy and childhood with variable
clinical features that are often nonspecific. They may cause
significant mortality and morbidity. Major clinical entities
that are seen in children are septic arthritis, classic long bone
osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis, disitis, and osteochondritis
complicating puncture wounds to the foot. Early diagnosis and
treatment of musculoskeletal infection are critical to prevent
sequelae. In children, these mean impaired growth with
restricting lifelong deformity. However, children show a high
potential for healing and remodeling and less comorbidity
than adults. Childhood bone infection generally has good
outcome provided appropriate treatment with antibiotics and
surgical intervention are offered in timely manner.
The patterns of bone infection in children are changing in
terms of both clinical syndrome (fewer acute presentation)
and of microbiology (e.g., increased bacterial resistance
among community acquired Staphylococcus aureus). A greater
understanding of pathogenesis and the varied manifestations of
osteomyelitis and septic arthritis is thus required. There is also
a need of clear guidelines with respect to treatment strategy,
particularly the role of surgery and choice of antibiotic agents.

Clinical Pearls
• Acute osteoarticular infections are prominent areas of bacterial
infection in infancy and childhood
• Joint space infection in children usually arises as a complication
of bacteremia
• Virus, fungal, and tuberculous infections are rare.

SEPTIC ARTHRITIS AND OSTEOMYELITIS
Joint space infection in children usually arises as a compli­
cation of bacteremia. Virus, fungal, and tuberculous infections
are rare. Bacterial infection elsewhere in the body may also
give rise to reactive arthritis.

ch-123.indd 601

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is most common in
childhood with a peak incidence in neonates. The reported
incidence has been falling around the world but remains high
in developing nations.
Osteomyelitis often is categorized into three different types:
• Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis
• Osteomyelitis secondary to contiguous spread of infection
after trauma, puncture wounds, surgery, or joint replacement
• Osteomyelitis secondary to vascular insufficiency.
Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is seen most often
in children. Osteomyelitis caused by contiguous spread of
infection is less common in children, and infection secondary
to vascular insufficiency is rare in children.

Clinical Pearls
• Osteomyelitis is most common in neonates
• Osteomyelitis is most common at metaphysis of long bones
• The history of trauma is common.

PATHOGENESIS
Pyogenic arthritis usually occurs as a result of infection of the
vascular synovium by means of hematogenous dissemination
of bacteria followed by an acute inflammatory response,
resulting in migration of polymorphonuclear white blood
cells (WBCs), production of proteolytic enzymes, and cytokine
secretion by chondrocytes. Degradation of articular cartilage
begins 8 hours after onset of infection. In children younger than
18 months of age, pyogenic arthritis can result from extension
of a metaphyseal bone infection through transphyseal blood
vessels. The growth plate, the epiphysis, and eventually the
joint space may be infected.
On the other hand, osteomyelitis occurs mostly by
hematogenous colonization of the bones by bacteria. The
metaphysis of long bones is the most common site. Theories
supporting this fact include decreased blood flow in sinusoidal
vessels in this area along with relative lack of phagocytic cells.
Although many children give a history of minor trauma, it is

11/22/2016 10:12:05 AM

Section 14: Rheumatology
very rare to see osteomyelitis complicating a closed fracture
treated by nonoperative means. Other notable features
of epidemiology including the male preponderance and
peak incidence remain to be explained. The pathological
response to osteomyelitis is one of acute inflammation in
the intramedullary cavity of the metaphysis of the long bone.
After 48 hours, pus accumulates subperiosteally and then
portions of the cortex may die as a result of the loss of blood
supply forming a sequestrum and the abscess may rupture.
Occasionally, osteomyelitis can involve the epiphysis of a long
bone and then is usually subacute although acute epiphyseal
osteomyelitis has been reported.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Most cases of AOI occur in children 3 years old or younger.
Boys are more frequently affected. The lower extremities (hips,
knees) are most commonly affected.

Clinical Pearls
• Acute osteoarticular infections is most common under 3 years
of life
• The most common agent is Staphylococcus aureus

MICROBIOLOGY
The most common agent is Staphylococcus aureus, followed by
respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus
pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and Haemophilus influenza
type b (Hib). Kingella kingae is a common cause of osteomyelitis
and septic arthritis in some areas and requires special culture
techniques or real-time polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The classical presentation of AOI is a locally swollen, warm
limb, or joint combined with high fever with no or minor prior
history of trauma. Pyrexia of unknown origin may be initial
mode of presentation.
Generally, children with septic arthritis are clinically more
ill than those with osteomyelitis, which has a more insidious
onset. Plenty of useful information may be obtained from the
disease history and mere observation of the patient. Limping,
pseudoparalysis, refusal to use particular limb, and focal
tenderness are the common mode of presentation. Whenever
a previously well child presents with monoarthritis of acute
origin, the possibility of septic arthritis should be considered.
Pelvic osteomyelitis is well known to mimic a number of other
diseases including appendicitis, lumbar disk prolapse, and
septic arthritis of the hip.

Clinical Pearls

602

ch-123.indd 602

• The classical presentation of acute osteoarticular infections (AOI)
is a locally swollen, warm limb, or joint combined with high fever
• Children with septic arthritis are clinically more ill than those
with osteomyelitis
• Whenever a previously well child presents with monoarthritis
of acute origin, think of AOI.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The most common cause of hip pain in childhood is transient
synovitis. Transient synovitis is predominantly seen in
children 5–10 years old. Pain is usually unilateral. Pain ranges
from mild to severe enough to wake the child up. Physical
examination generally reveals a nonill appearing child with
decreased range of motion of the hip joint. Other common
causes of joint pain and swelling include reactive arthritis,
rheumatic fever, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, trauma,
and malignancy. Malignancy often turns out to be the most
important differential diagnosis for osteomyelitis. LeggCalve-Perthes disease is an idiopathic avascular necrosis of
the capital femoral epiphysis and may cause mild pain and
limp in boys.

DIAGNOSIS
A sample for bacteriology may be obtained by needle aspiration
of soft tissue in neonates, subperiosteal aspiration in infants,
or drilling of bone in older children. (Blood and joint fluid)
should be obtained for aerobic and anaerobic cultures.
Blood tests, namely hemogram and acute phase reactants,
are used to assess the extent of inflammation. Blood leukocyte
count (WBC) is nonspecific and elevated only in 20% of
cases. Out of all acute phase reactants, C-reactive protein
(CRP) here is extremely helpful in diagnosis and monitoring
of AOI. Traditional radiographs have minimum or no value
in diagnosis of it as the changes appear late. Ultrasound is
extremely helpful for detection of joint effusion. However,
magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are
the investigations of choice for early diagnosis. Bone scans
in acute hematogenous osteomyelitis have a sensitivity of
84–100% and a specificity of 40–96%. The sensitivity of bone
scans is least in the first 48 hours due to the transitional period
between decreased and increased activity. Scintigraphy is
most helpful in detecting multiple foci of disease and in the
assessment of the young child, where localization is difficult.
Although cultures frequently fail to disclose the causative
agent, every attempt should be made for isolation of
causative agent from the site of infection. The only indication
of joint aspiration in pediatric age group nowadays is septic
arthritis, even though the chance of getting positive culture
is only 30%. Aspirated fluid should be inoculated directly into
blood culture bottles. Gram stain and cell count should also
be performed on joint fluid. A WBC count of 50,000/mm3 or
greater with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells is
consistent with bacterial infection.

Clinical Pearls
• Every attempt should be made to find out the etiological
agent from infected tissue
• C-reactive protein here is extremely helpful in diagnosis and
monitoring of acute osteoarticular infections
• Traditional radiographs have minimum or no value in diagnosis
• Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography is
the investigation of choice for the early diagnosis.

Chapter 123: Acute Osteoarticular Infections

TREATMENT
A local antibiogram would be of paramount importance in
these situations. As Staphylococcus aureus is a major player
in AOIs, its local sensitivity pattern influences the choice of
the initial antibiotic. The empiric antibiotic treatment of AOI
in primary methicillin sensitive and methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is first or second generation
cephalosporins (150 mg/kg/day four times a day)/cloxacillin
(200 mg/kg/day four times a day) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/
day four times a day)/trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMPSMX) (TMP16 mg/kg/day twice a day), respectively. Linezolid
(30 mg/kg/day three times a day) is the drug of choice in areas
where the organism is resistant to vancomycin/TMP-SMX. A
Hib unvaccinated child from Hib endemic area should receive
concomitant ampicillin or amoxicillin (200 mg/kg/day divided
in four equal doses) until the agent is identified. Currently,
there is no consensus about the route or duration for antibiotic
treatment of acute osteomyelitis in children. Until recently, the
standard therapy was a long intravenous therapy and a long
duration of 4–6 weeks. However, the short antibiotic courses
tested in recent trials on osteomyelitis and septic arthritis.
The entire course of antibiotic was approximately 3 weeks
for uncomplicated osteomyelitis and 10–14 days for septic
arthritis. A high dose of well absorbed first/second generation
cephalosporins or clindamycin in equal doses four times a day
was used. These antibiotics penetrate bone and soft tissue well
in intravenous and oral administration. In absence of definite
laboratory or clinical parameters that would determine the
decision to switch to oral therapy, there is no clear guideline
of when to switch from intravenous to oral therapy. The drugs

were given in recent trials intravenously for first 2–4 days
except in newborns and thereafter it was given orally, provided
the first signs of recovery including disappearance of fever,
taking oral fluids were observed, and the level of CRP began
to descend. However, this protocol is not applicable in the case
for the management of complex infections including those
with multifocal disease, significant bone destruction, resistant
or unusual pathogens, sepsis or in immunosuppressed
children, and in neonates. The intravenous therapy to be
continued for 14–21 days in complex situations and switched
over to oral medication provided the baby is afebrile, painfree for at least 24 hours, and CRP descended by two-thirds of
highest value. The total antibiotic therapy here will be 6 weeks
both in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. The role of surgery
in the treatment of septic arthritis is in fact poorly defined
except in relation to the hip, where prompt surgical drainage
is absolutely necessary. Aspiration, irrigation, and intravenous
antibiotic therapy is the preferred first line of treatment of
septic arthritis except in hip joint. No consensus prevails in the
timing, procedures, extent, or even the overall need for surgical
intervention in osteomyelitis. Surgical drainage is mandatory
in osteomyelitis if pus is obtained from the subperiosteal space
or metaphysic in nature. The abscess should be decompressed,
evacuated, and washed-out under general anesthesia. A
suction drain should be left in place for 48 hours.
Though further studies are needed in this field, a placebo
controlled randomized controlled trial examined the use
of 4 days of intravenous dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg/dose
intravenously 8 hourly) and it significantly reduced the
duration of acute phase and morbidity.

Conclusion
The number of bone and joint infections resulting from vaccine
preventable pathogens like Haemophilus influenza and
Streptococcus pneumoniae are on the decline. Staphylococcus
aureus is the most common pathogen causing septic arthritis
and osteomyelitis in children all over the world. The incidence
of community acquired MRSA is increasing and is a cause
of concern for pediatricians. Early diagnosis and prompt
and appropriate treatment consisting of antibiotic therapy
and surgical intervention when required is the mainstay
of treatment and is extremely rewarding in majority of the
occasions.

PROGNOSIS
Complications of AOI include abnormal bone growth, limp,
unstable articulation of the affected joint, and decreased range
of motion. Complications are reported in approximately 10–
25% of all cases. Risk factors for squeal include delay in time to
diagnosis of more than 4 or 5 days, onset of disease in infancy,
infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative
bacteria, and infection of adjacent bone.

Eye Involvement: Beyond Infections
Manjari Agarwal

INTRODUCTION
Eyes are a window to systemic disease and can help a clinician
reach an elusive diagnosis, by simply doing a proper detailed
ophthalmological examination. Eyes are involved in a
multitude of rheumatological illnesses and every incidence
of eye problem is not due to infection. For the sake of this
review, infectious etiologies would not be discussed. This
review aims at stressing upon the eye involvement in various
rheumatological/immunoinflammatory diseases. For ease of
explanation, involvement of each layer of the eye is discussed
separately (Fig. 1).

Redness of eyes with photophobia is seen in about 85%
children with Kawasaki disease. Bilateral, nonexudative, and
bulbar conjunctivitis is the hallmark of the disease. Perilimbal
sparing of the conjunctiva is usually seen. Uveitis may or may

not be present in Kawasaki disease. Presence of purulent
conjunctivitis usually rules out Kawasaki disease.

SCLERITIS
Sclera is the outer protective layer of the eye, begins at the
limbus and is continuous with the cornea and ends at the optic
canal in continuity with the dura.
Episcleritis is usually more painful and is often self-limiting.
Scleritis usually affects the adult population between 30
and 50 years of age. The most commen association of scleritis
in this age group is with Granulomatous polyangiitis and
rheumatoid arthritis (Table 1).

Diagnosis
Detailed history, and physical examination is a must. Investi­
gations pertaining to the system involved must be carried

antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
(ANCA), rheumatoid factor, and anticyclic citrullinated
peptide antibodies.
Other investigations like Mantoux test can be done after
history and physical examination.

Treatment
Treatment of scleritis can be divided on the type of scleritis and
has been detailed in table 2.

INTERSTITIAL KERATITIS
Interstitial keratitis is characterized by a nonsuppurative
inflammation, with vascularization of the cornea. It is
commonly seen with Cogan syndrome. It usually presents with
pain, lacrimation, photophobia, and conjunctival injection.
This usually responds to topical corticosteroid therapy.

Clinical Pearls
• Eyes can be involved in a myriad of immunoinflammatory
conditions
• Redness of eyes with photophobia, with or without diminution
of vision might be a red flag and should be appropriately
evaluated.

Retinal vascular inflammatory diseases are termed retinal
vasculitis even in the absence of true vasculitis. It can be
defined as inflammation of the retinal vessels accompanied by
intraocular inflammation and retinal vessel occlusion. Retinal
vasculitis may involve retinal arteries, veins, or capillaries.
A common cause of retinal vasculitis leading to significant
ocular morbidity is Behçet’s disease. Both retinal veins as well

methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil might be required
for maintenance therapy.

Orbital Disease
Primary inflammation of the orbital tissue, e.g., orbital
pseudotumor or orbital myositis due to inflammation of the
extraocular muscles is usually seen. Secondary involvement
occurs most commonly due to contiguous spread of
inflammation from the sinuses seen typically in ANCA
associated vasculitis.

or immunosuppressive drug therapy, decreases associated
symptoms, as well as improves visual acuity.

Systemic vasculitides can also cause retinal vasculitis
although these are uncommon.

vasculitis even in the absence of antiphospholipid antibodies.
The retinal vessels can be involved causing cotton-wool spots

Acute anterior uveitis is characteristic of human leukocyte
antigen B27 (HLA-B27)–associated diseases such as enthesitisrelated arthritis. Patient presents with a red, painful, and
photophobic eye. The anterior chamber is best visualized by
the help of a slit lamp. The presence of cells in the anterior
chamber indicates disease activity. At times, the cells might
aggregate in the lower part of the anterior chamber due to
gravity and produce a hypopyon. If left untreated, there is a
tendency to form adhesions between the posterior part of iris
and lens; these are termed as posterior synechiae.

Few children, especially older than 7–8 years of age can
complain of pain, redness, headache, photophobia, or blurring
of vision.
Slit lamp examination is mandatory to diagnose uveitis.
Presence of inflammatory cells and increased protein
concentration (flare) in the aqueous humor of the anterior
chamber are the classic hallmark.
Keratic precipitates (deposition of inflammatory cells on
the inner surface of the cornea) may be detected at onset or
may develop later.
Band keratopathy occurs due to deposition of calcium in
the corneal epithelium and is also a late feature.
Presence of posterior synechiae is also a feature of late
disease. Untreated synechiae might occasionally cause
obstruction to aqueous outflow and cause increased intra­
ocular pressure.
Since chronic uveitis might lead to significant visual
morbidity, it is prudent to electively screen children with JIA.
Table 5 gives a guideline for screening of children depending
upon the risk involved. Uveitis may also be associated with
other inflammatory disorders in children like inflammatory
bowel disease and reactive arthritis. Uveitis can also in
occur in chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and
articular syndrome, sarcoidosis, Blau syndrome, Bechet’s
disease and Kawasaki disease. Algorithm 1 gives provides an
outline of the diagnostic possibilities for children presenting
with uveitis.

Management
Uveitis associated without arthritis needs to be evaluated
and infections like tuberculosis need to be ruled out.
Angiotensin converting enzyme levels for sarcoidosis, HLA
B51 for Behçet’s disease, ANA need to be done if child does
not have arthritis. Human leukocyte antigen B27 associated
uveitis is usually acute symptomatic but rarely may be

Clinical Pearl
• Acute anterior uveitis might often be the first presentation of
disorders like juvenile spondyloarthropathy and inflammatory
bowel disease.

Similar adhesions between peripheral iris and posterior
cornea are called anterior synechiae. Chronic uveitis is the
most common ocular complication of oligoarticular juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (JIA). It is initially asymptomatic and is
picked up on routine screening. It is predominantly insidious
in onset, anterior, nongranulomatous inflammation affecting
the iris and ciliary body.

Treatment
The management of uveitis is done by ophthalmology and
rheumatology teams jointly.
Topical glucocorticoid drops with or without mydriatics
are the first line agents. Topical therapy for prolonged period is
associated with severe ocular complications like cataract and
glaucoma.
Second line agent for uveitis unresponsive to topical
therapy is methotrexate. It can also be used as a steroid sparing
agent with excellent results.
Mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus are
the next line of management.
Severe, unresponsive disease can be managed by tumor
necrosis factor alpha blocker, infliximab.
There is also some role of costimulatory blockade, abatacept
for resistant uveitis though large trials are still required.

Clinical Pearls
• In children with diagnosed juvenile idiopathic arthritis, routine
screening for chronic anterior uveitis is a mandate
• Topical therapy for prolonged period of time can cause
significant morbidity and must be avoided.

Empyema Thoracis:
Management Algorithm
Rasik S Shah, Suyodhan A Reddy

INTRODUCTION
Empyema thoracis (ET) is collection of purulent fluid in the
pleural cavity, which is either free or localized. Pneumonic
infection and the associated inflammation of the pleural
lining lead to an exudative parapneumonic pleural effusion,
which upon invasion by bacteria becomes empyema. The term
“empyema” is derived from the Greek words pyon, meaning pus
and empyein, meaning pus producing. The optimal time and
the manner of drainage of empyema was a matter of concern
since the times of Hippocrates and Fabricus. In the last two
decades, many pediatric surgical centers are increasingly using
minimal access techniques in management of ET patients.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Childhood empyema occurs in 0.7–3.3 per 100,000 worldwide.
There is gradual increase in the incidence. The pattern of use
of antibiotics and incorporation of polyvalent pneumococcal
vaccine (7vPVC) into immunization programs has led to an
increase in invasive pneumococcal empyema by nonvaccine
serotypes.

ETIOPATHOGENESIS
Empyema thoracis most often occurs as a sequel of bacterial
pneumonia; however, it can also occur following pulmonary
tuberculosis, trauma, perforation of intrathoracic esophageal,
or operations on chest. Lower respiratory tract infection
in children may get complicated by parapneumonic fluid
collections in 50% of patients. Progression to an established ET
occurs in 1 of every 155 cases of pneumonia according to one
large pediatric series.
In India, Staphylococcus aureus is still the most common
isolate from the children of ET. This is followed by Strepto­
coccus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Although
S. pneumoniae produces large effusion in 40% of the cases,
only 5% eventually progress to frank ET. Tubercular empyema

ch-125.indd 609

is rare and occurs only in 2% of the cases of tubercular pleural
infections. Anaerobes are common in older children who often
have predisposing factors like aspiration pneumonia, lung
abscess, and poor dental hygiene. Aspergillus and Candida
albicans also have been isolated. Rarely, Entamoeba histolytica
abscess in the liver may rupture in the pleural cavity and
produce ET with Entamoeba histolytica.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The smooth and synchronized expansion of the lung in
consonance with the expansion of the chest wall is facilitated
by a small amount of intrapleural fluid (0.3 mL/kg). This is
maintained in a dynamic equilibrium in visceral and parietal
pleura by unidirectional flow created by lymphatics. These
lymphatics generate a negative pressure of about 7 mmHg
and are capable of absorbing large volumes of clear low solute
fluids in the pleural space. However, a secondary infection
in the pleural space triggers an inflammatory process, which
makes the pleural vasculature to become more permeable
to inflammatory cells and bacteria. The pleural fluid now
transforms into exudates of frank pus, resulting in the classical
empyema. This influx is mediated by proinflammatory
cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)1b, and IL-6, secreted from mesothelial cells. The activation
of the coagulation cascade and disruption of enzymes of the
fibrinolytic system, such as tissue type plasminogen activator
and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, results in fibrin
deposition and blockage of lymphatic pores leading to further
accumulation of fluid. This imbalance of the fibrin produces
multiple loculations and formations of fibrinopurulent peel as
seen in the later stages of empyema.
Empyema thoracis is classified in to three stages, i.e.,
exudative, fibrinopurulent, and organizing stage by the
American Thoracic Society. The pathological response is
divided in three phases that are not sharply distinct but
gradually one phase merges into another (Table 1).

Hamm and light described a stage that proceeds to the
stage of exudation, which they termed “pleuritis sicca stage”,
this is characterized by the presence of pleuritic chest pain and
pleural rub. This does not proceed to exudative stage.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Empyema is more common in the poor socioeconomic group.
The incidence peaks between 6 months and 3 years of age.
Clinical signs vary depending on the type of organism isolated,
age of the patient, stage of the effusion, and type of prior
antibiotic therapy.
The bacterial pneumonia in children usually presents
with cough and fever; development of pleuritic chest pain and
dyspnea heralds complication of ET. Children may lie on the
affected side in attempt to splint the chest. The breath sounds
and respiratory movements’ decreases on the side of empyema.
There may be shift of the mediastinum. Often scoliosis is seen
toward the affected side on both clinical examination and chest
X-ray. This occurs initially in an attempt to reduce the pleural
pain and later on due to the result of fibrosis of the parietal
pleura. In late stages of ET, the ipsilateral chest is collapsed with
crowding of ribs leading to obliteration of intercostal space,
pulling of mediastinum, and diaphragm on the side of ET and
scoliosis. The patients can develop pyopneumothorax due to air
leak either from lung parenchyma [parenchymo-pleural fistula
(PPF)] or by erosion of bronchus [bronchopleural fistula (BPF)].

INVESTIGATIONS
Investigations are performed to determine quantity and
quality of fluid present in the pleural space and its effect on the
cardiorespiratory system.

Chest Radiograph

610

All children with symptoms suggestive of febrile respiratory
illness should have a chest X-ray posteroanterior view. Blunting
of costophrenic angle and pleural shadowing suggests presence
of free fluid in the pleural space. Massive fluid accumulation
in the chest may show opacified hemithorax with or without
mediastinal shift. Presence of air fluid level suggests either
anaerobic infection, or BPF or PPF. Advanced stage of the
disease may show fibrosis where the mediastinum is pulled
toward the fibrosed pleura. The chest X-ray is not helpful
in monitoring the progress of the disease and radiological
features lag behind the physiological changes.

ch-125.indd 610

Ultrasonography of Chest
The ultrasonography of chest is the most useful investigation;
it is noninvasive, does not use ionizing radiation, provides a
dynamic assessment of the chest, and can be done repeatedly
without fear of any adverse effect. It can differentiate between
consolidated lungs from fluid in pleural space. It also detects
presence of loculations and fibrin strands, and volume of the
fluid in the pleural space. The sonologist can mark the spot
for the aspiration of fluid and/or chest-tube insertion. The
aspiration of fluid differentiates between sympneumonic
effusion and ET. Though ultrasound is useful to stage the ET in
children, it is not helpful in predicting its outcome.9

Computed Tomography Scan
The role of routine computed tomography (CT) is controversial.
The CT scan often requires general anesthesia or sedation,
which may be a limiting factor in some very small and sick
child. CT scan also gives lot of radiation. Its role is limited in
patients, who are not responding to the treatment. The CT scan
precisely shows site of fluid collection, thickness of fibrotic
peel, its location, and whether it is on visceral surface of lung
or on diaphragm or chest-wall. This information is useful to
endoscopic surgeons for the port placement to avoid trauma
to the lung and subsequent PPF or BPF. Though the CT scan
can demonstrate the lung parenchyma and it pathologies
accurately, it is unable to identify the presence of thin fibrinous
strands in pleural fluid. Coren et al. reviewed the use of CT
scanning in preoperative assessment and found that CT scans
were least useful in the preoperative assessment of empyema
complicating community-acquired pneumonia.

Clinical Pearls
• X-ray chest posteroanterior view should be done in all children
in whom an empyema is suspected
• Ultrasound is the most informative investigation
• Computed tomography scan is reserved for patients who are
not responding to treatment or as a preoperative investigation.

Hematological Investigations
The total blood count may reveal anemia, leukocytosis with
polymorphonuclear predominance, and thrombocytosis and
raised C-reactive protein. The falling levels of white blood
cell count and C-reactive protein are indicative of clinical
improvement. Thrombocytosis is common in many chronic

11/24/2016 2:28:04 PM

Chapter 125: Empyema Thoracis: Management Algorithm
inflammatory conditions including empyema. However, low
platelet count with low hemoglobin in a child with empyema
should alert the physician about possibility of the hemolytic
uremic syndrome, which often develops secondary to
neuraminidase release by Streptococcus pneumonia.
The coagulation studies are usually normal in healthy
children with normal liver. However, children with impaired
liver and chronic malnutrition may have abnormal blood
coagulation. Single screening of coagulation should suffice at
the time of initial venous cannulation.

Clinical Pearl
• Resolution of fever, falling levels of total leucocyte counts and
C-reactive protein are favorable indicators.

Pleural Fluid Analysis
Pleural fluid tapping is highly informative, however, the
procedure is challenging as it might require sedation in a
sick child. Small collections are best left alone. The fluid is
examined for Gram staining, aerobic and anaerobic culture,
pH, specific gravity, protein content, glucose estimation, and
LDH levels. The specimen should be sent for microscopy and
culture. The reported rate of isolating a pathogen varies and
depends on the prior antibiotic usage. If facilities permit 16s
ribosomal RNA ploymerase chain reactions (PCR) should be
done and suitable antibiotics should be instituted. The fluid
should also be cultured for Mycobacterium tuberculosis..

Clinical Pearls
• Pleural fluid is sent for microscopy, cytology and culture
• Polymerase chain reaction if available should be used
• There is no role of biochemical markers in children.

MANAGEMENT
The broad principles in management of empyema include
treatment to stop ongoing sepsis, restoring the normal lung
volume, and reestablish the physiological pleural fluid
circulation. The child’s hemodynamic status should be
stabilized with oxygen therapy, parenteral fluids, antipyretics,
and analgesia.

Clinical Pearl
• Sterilize and evacuate the thorax at the earliest

Antibiotics
Antibiotics alone have a role in small effusions in which the
child has no respiratory compromise. The choice of antibiotic
should be based on local policy on pneumonia guidelines
and knowledge of both community and hospital acquired
pathogens. The antibiotics are selected empirically and
changed according to the Gram staining and culture sensitivity
of the aspirated pus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to

ch-125.indd 611

ensure adequate cover for S. pneumonia, and consideration
should be given to antistaphylococcal cover, particularly if
pneumatoceles are present. Adequate anaerobic cover should
be given when there is a clinical suspicion for aspiration
pneumonia. Once the child is afebrile then child can be shifted
to oral therapy, which can extend up to 6 weeks.

Pleural Cavity Drainage

Clinical Pearls
Modalities for Drainage
•
•
•
•

Multiple needle thoracocentesis
Tube drainage of chest with or without fibrinolytics
Video-assisted thoracic surgery
Open thoracotomy.

Timing of Drainage
The timing of pleural cavity drainage should be individualized
depending upon the local expertise and the balance of
noninvasive monitoring and expectant management. The
decision to intervene and drain the fluid is taken when the fluid
analysis is suggestive of empyema and/or if child develops
respiratory distress (Algorithm 1).

Options for Drainage
Aspiration is done under local anesthesia with sedation at
the most dependent site or in the fifth intercostal space in
midaxillary line. In the exudative stage, it may be possible to
aspirate ET completely; however, as the pus becomes thicker
and flakes of fibrinopurulent material starts forming, it is not
possible to aspirate the ET completely. Some studies have
compared the efficacy of repeated thoracocentesis to that of
chest tube drainage and found both comparable. These studies
concluded that repeated needle aspirations are more traumatic;
require multiple anesthesia and ultrasonography assistance.
These studies recommend early chest tube insertion.
Chest tube drainage along with parenteral antibiotic
is the standard management in the exudative stage and in
fibrinopurulent stage. Addition of fibrinolytics shortens the
duration of the chest drainage and improves the clinical
outcome. Adequate chest drainage and good broadspectrum antibiotics resolve the fever and leukocytosis, with
almost complete lung reexpansion as seen on X-ray and/
or sonography. The chest drainage should be continued till
drainage decrease to less than 10–15 mL/day, which usually
takes 7–14 days. The successful resolution with conservative
management has been reported in 65–82% of the patients, and
rest will require surgical therapy.

Clinical Pearl
• More than two-thirds of early empyema can resolve with
standard management of antibiotics and chest tube drainage.
Remaining needs surgical intervention.

Pepperpoint et al. compared and reviewed the outcomes
in terms of length of hospital stay and the need for further
intervention in children with empyema treated either with
a stiff large bore tube or with small bore pig tail catheter. The
outcomes were significantly better in children who received
small bored catheter. It has been observed that the most of the
patients in India presents late and they do better with large
bore chest drain then pigtail catheter.
Satish et al. in their study conducted in the secondary referral
center on 14 children concluded that chest drainage along with
antibiotics is sufficient to treat empyema. They also suggested
there is no need for surgical decortications in children. However,
in this study, the physiological and radiological resolution was
obtained up to 16 months. The prolonged hospital stay, coupled
with the extraordinarily long recovery of lung has significant
economic, social, and academic implications of a growing
child. Spencer in his editorial comment observed, “it is not time
to put the knife down”.
As the duration of the empyema advances, there is increased
fibrin formation and this result in loculated pus pockets. Use
of fibrinolytics in pleura is to lyse the fibrin strands, clear the

ch-125.indd 612

lymphatics, and liquefy the pus. The literature is replete with
case series describing the management using streptokinase,
urokinase, aleptase, or tissue plasminogen activator in various
different protocols.
In fibrinopurulent stage with loculations and in organizing
stage, the simple chest drain or cyclical irrigation is unlikely to
work and they would need either formal decortication or videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). In fibrinopurulent
stage, it is more of pleural debridement and breaking up of
the loculations, which ensures adequate drainage. This can be
safely accomplished by VATS. Open decortication is required in
a miniscule number of advanced cases of empyema. The term
decortication refers to the removal of the thick fibrotic parietal
and visceral pleural peel found in the late chronic disease is
accomplished with open thoracotomy either with or without
rib resection.

Clinical Pearl
• Early surgical intervention allows faster recovery and rapid
lung expansion.

11/24/2016 2:28:04 PM

Chapter 125: Empyema Thoracis: Management Algorithm
The term primary and secondary VATS is used for the
procedures performed before or after the trial of standard
management, respectively. VATS offsets many disadvantages
of open thoracotomy and provides excellent vision of the
entire hemithorax. The primary VATS allows determination
of the stage of the disease, breaking of all loculi with complete
evacuation of thick pus, and fibrinopurulent material. In
early stage, it may reduce the bacterial load and chest drain
is inserted in the proper dependent position. In addition,
VATS gives visual impression of condition of underlying lung,
its capacity to expand, and presence, site, and size of PPF or
BPF. However, it may be difficult to perform formal resection
of lung parenchyma to control the air leak using VATS in
small children. The almost complete removal of thick pus and
fibrinopurulent material results in early resolution of fever,
chest drain is required for short duration and postprocedure
hospitalization is reduced to 6–7 days. VATS causes minimal
disturbance in the anatomy of nerves, muscles, and ribs. The
integrity of the chest wall and the dynamics of the respiration
are not disturbed. Kyphoscoliosis is avoided in children who
undergo VATS. The less invasive nature of VATS produces less
pain and better postoperative lung movements. This finally
translates into early recovery and excellent cosmesis. The
aesthetic appearance and the normal anatomy of the spine
and the rib cage improve the child’s posture and self esteem.
The above-mentioned benefits make VATS as an attractive
option in treatment for empyema in children. Moreover, the
VATS reduce the cytokine response of the body in comparison
to open thoracotomy.
However, VATS needs general anesthesia, operating room,
endoscopic equipment, and team of experienced anesthetist
and endoscopic surgeon. Some of the very sick patients
undergoing VATS may need postprocedure careful monitoring,
preferably in pediatric intensive care unit. The primary VATS in
ET have been reported to have the best outcome. The author
recommends primary VATS if patient presents late (>7 days
history) or if there are loculations on imaging studies as the
standard management is likely to fail. If thick fibrotic peel does
not allow dissection to proceed to create enough space then
the open decortication by minithoracotomy with or without rib
resection should be performed.
Open thoracotomy and decortication involves opening
of the thorax posterolaterally and excision of the thickened
pleural encasing the lung. Lung pathologies like lung
abscesses, necrotic lung, and BPF, if any, can be addressed
simultaneously. It is an excellent modality of treatment useful
in the treatment of advanced stage of empyema. Long-term
aftereffects of open thoracotomy are often crippling.
Alexiou et al. reviewed their data of 44 children and
concluded that open decortications are an excellent option for
treating of advanced empyema. Fibrinolysis and VATS should
be considered on their own merits, and should not be based on
the adverse outcomes of open thoracotomy.
In the past, VATS was used after the failure of medical
therapy, now it is increasingly used as primary therapy. In an
study from Dallas on 139 children, Doski et al. demonstrated

ch-125.indd 613

that children who underwent primary VATS significantly
reduced hospital stay compared to those who had secondary
VATS or open decortications for failed medical treatment.
Cohen et al. compared results of primary VATS with
chest drainage alone and found significant reduction in
the hospital stay (7.4 vs. 15.4 days) and removal of chest
drain (4.0 vs. 10.2 days) in VATS group. In addition, 39% of
children with chest drainage alone required some other form
of surgical intervention. This study clearly demonstrates the
superiority of VATS over chest drain alone. This observation
has been confirmed from different centers. There are no
studies comparing primary VATS with open decortication in
children. Subramanium et al. demonstrated reduced hospital
stay in VATS group of children in comparison to the open
thoracotomy group in children who were referred for the
failure of medical treatment.
Gates et al. carried out a systematic review of 44 retrospective
studies to assess the superiority of VATS over chest drainage
alone, fibrinolysis, or thoracotomy. They concluded VATS and
open decortication led to early recovery in children. The study
also identifies the lack of properly designed study to answer
the question of superiority of VATS over the other available
modalities of treatment.

Clinical Pearl
• Multiple studies throughout the world have confirmed the
safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of video-assisted thoraco­
scopic surgery in the treatment of empyema in children.

Key points

))
Empyema thoracis is a complex pediatric surgical disease and

the best standard of care involve pediatric surgeon as soon as
it is suspected
))
Management needs to be individualized depending upon
the presentation and stage of disease
))
For patient presents early (<7 days of symptoms), standard
management can be offered in the form of intravenous
antibiotics and intercostal drainage
))
Patients presenting late (>7 days of symptoms), or having
loculations on imaging studies (X-ray or ultrasonography of
chest) should be offered primary video-assisted thoracoscopic
surgery
))
Patients who fails to respond to standard management
clinically and radiologically in 48–72 hours should be offered
secondary video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
))
Patients having chronic disease with crowding of ribs should
be offered an open surgery
))
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in treatment of empyema
has decreased morbidity and mortality of the disease
))
In India, due to limited availability of resources and the
endoscopic surgical expertise, many patient who fails to
received standard care may need either referral to higher
center or an open surgery at appropriate time.

Evaluation of Acute
Abdominal Pain in Children
Ketan P Parikh

INTRODUCTION
The abdomen has often been labeled as a Pandora’s box.
This analogy is rooted in the fact that in many situations, the
clinical presentation and investigative conclusions are rivaled
by the finally ascertained diagnosis. Thus, every patient of an
acute abdominal pain needs to be evaluated systematically to
ascertain the most likely etiology to avoid long-term morbidity
or an occasional mortality.
The term acute abdominal pain refers to a sudden,
severe pain in the abdomen of short duration—usually of
24–48 hours. In contrast the term acute abdomen refers to
a clinical condition with other manifestations which may
include (besides the acute abdominal pain) a variety of other
symptoms more particularly: vomiting, abdominal distension,
fever, constipation, or diarrhea besides other symptoms. There
may be an element of general toxicity due to dehydration or
septicemia necessitating a more detailed assessment.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Clinically, three categories of pain may arise from the abdomen:
• Visceral (splanchnic) pain: it results from stimulation of a
viscous with a noxious stimulus like stretching or ischemia.
It is usually dull, poorly localized, and is experienced in the
midline. Pain arising from foregut structures (e.g., lower
esophagus, stomach) is generally felt in the epigastrium,
from midgut structures (small intestine) to the umbilical
area and from hindgut structures to the hypogastrium
• Parietal pain: it follows a noxious stimulation of the
parietal peritoneum. It is experienced with inflammation
of the parietal peritoneum. It is usually sharp, discrete, and
localized, and aggravates on coughing or movement
• Referred pain: it has characteristics of parietal pain but is
felt in remote areas supplied by the same dermatome as
the diseased organ. A classic example: abdominal pain
experienced due to the supradiaphragmatic irritation of
pleura due to a lobar pneumonia.

The fact that abdominal pain is so elusive is often a cause
for it being labeled as functional or psychogenic in some
cases. However, it needs to be emphasized that the labeling of
this pain as psychogenic should be an opinion of exhaustive
exclusion rather than a default assumption.
In spite of the multitude of investigative armamentarium
available, evaluation of a child with an acute abdomen relies
significantly on the clinical assessment and its correlation with
the investigations. In doubtful situations, repeated physical
examination by the same physician is often useful.

))
Visceral pain: usually dull, poorly localized and in the midline
))
Parietal pain: sharp, localized.

PAIN HISTORY
The chronology of the clinical presentation and the age of the
child are important in the evaluation. In the acute surgical
abdomen, pain generally precedes vomiting, while the reverse
is true in medical conditions.
Most preadolescents have a poor sense of onset or location
of pain. In children who cannot verbalize, the initial symptoms
of nausea or periumbilical (visceral) pain may go unnoticed,
and thus they often present at the second stage of visceral pain.
A neonate or an infant with abdominal pain may express in
the form of excessive crying, transient apneic spells or even
grunting. These subtle symptoms require astute supervision to
raise an early alarm to avoid missing life-threatening surgical
emergencies.

))
Pain preceding vomiting: possibly surgical abdomen
))
Vomiting preceding pain: more likely medical abdomen.
Associated symptoms which have a significant bearing are:
• Vomiting (Table 1):
{{ Nonbilious vomiting:
–– Common with a routine gastroenteritis

SECTION 15: Pediatric Surgery
TABLE 1: Associated clinical features in a patient with acute abdominal pain
Vomiting

Before onset of pain

Possibly medical cause

After onset of pain

More likely to be surgical cause—e.g., appendicitis/intestinal
obstruction

Bilious

More likely to be surgical cause—e.g., intestinal obstruction

Nonbilious

May be either medical condition (gastritis/hepatitis, etc.) or
early surgical cause

After excessive crying especially in a small child

Aerophagia

With acute constipation

Possibly surgical, e.g., intestinal obstruction

Upper abdominal distension

Possibly an upper abdominal obstruction

With diarrhea

Severe watery → ?enterocolitis
Persistent but small quantity → ?peritonitis

Constipation

Absolute (feces + flatus)

Intestinal obstruction

Passing more flatus

Aerophagia (possibly supradiaphragmatic cause)

Fever

If after 1 or 2 days of abdominal pain

Surgical cause like appendicitis/peritonitis, etc.

If precedes abdominal pain

More likely to be inflammatory like enterocolitis

Loose motions

If feculent

Enterocolitis

Mainly mucus/blood

Intussusception/peritonitis/high intestinal obstruction

–– It is also an early feature of a surgical abdomen
(an intussusception) or an inflammatory cause
(like an acute appendicitis)
–– Persistent nonbilious vomiting along with abdo­
minal pain at any age may also be seen in peri­tonitis.
These patients may have fever/abdominal distension
and constipation. A child with meconium peritonitis
with secondary bacterial peritonitis may also have a
periumbilical mottling besides radiological features
of calcification in a case of intestinal obstruction/
peritonitis (Fig. 1)
–– Some of the urogenital causes of acute abdomen
may also have nonbilious vomiting:
■■ Pyelonephritis—hypertension, urine exami­
nation, abdominal USG
■■ Testicular torsion—clinical examination
■■ Ovarian torsion—USG or other imaging
■■ Renal colics—dysuria/USG
■■ Bilious vomiting at almost any age signifies an
intestinal obstruction unless proved otherwise
Abdominal distension: it is usually a late sign in most cases
of acute abdomen. It may result from:
{{ Gas (aerophagia)—predominant gaseous distension is
more a feature of hypoperistalsis
{{ Intestinal obstruction—usually distension is a late
symptom and may present as visible/palpable loops of
bowel

{{

{{

Fluid in the peritoneal cavity—in an acute abdomen
this may suggest peritonitis
If accompanied by acute constipation or obstipation—
surgical cause
A neonate with a scaphoid abdomen or distension
restricted to upper half could possibly either be:
–– A high bowel atresia (duodenal/high jejunal)

CHAPTER 126: Evaluation of Acute Abdominal Pain in Children

•

•

–– A midgut volvulus due to an intestinal malrotation
especially if there is a delayed onset of intestinal
obstruction
■■ In either case, a surgical exploration would be
needed; a delay in surgically exploring a case of
midgut volvulus could lead to extensive gangrene
of the entire midgut which is incompatible to
normal life without life-long total parenteral
nutrition/intestinal transplantation
■■ In those cases where the abdominal distension
is more generalized, a lower intestinal obstruc­
tion may be considered
{{ If accompanied with diarrhea:
–– Either severe enterocolitis (there would also be
frequent passage of flatus) or peritonitis (there is
usually infrequent passage of flatus and minimal
fecal content) is a strong indication for a surgical
opinion. Bogginess in the prerectal space on a perrectal examination would almost be diagnostic of a
pelvic peritonitis
–– An acute appendicitis in a pre-school child may
present directly as peritonitis because of the
subtlety of the early symptoms and the rapid
progression of the pathology at this age
Constipation: unlike chronic constipation, acute consti­
pation usually has an organic cause:
{{ Absolute constipation (obstipation—failure to pass
feces/flatus)—strongly suggests a surgical cause of
acute abdomen
{{ Frequent passage of flatus in a patient with abdominal
distension—possibly medical cause/pneumonia
{{ Chronic constipation preceding abdominal pain—
more likely primary constipation
{{ Constipation following vomiting and abdominal pain—
more likely surgical. Child may pass 1 or 2 normal
stools and constipation may set in later once the bowel
distal to the obstruction is completely evacuated. In
neonates with congenital bowel obstruction, there may
be a history of passage of some meconium, but in most
cases, direct questioning of the neonate’s attendant
may reveal that this meconium was pale colored. In
those cases where the neonates acute abdomen has set
in a few days after the passage of normal meconium,
the possibility of volvulus with malrotation becomes
higher
{{ In the occasional patient with high obstruction and
peritonitis, the baby may pass loose motions due
to peritoneal irritation of the distal bowel; however,
this would be predominantly mucoid and not bile
containing
Fever:
{{ If the acute abdominal pain follows a febrile illness, it
is likely to be secondary to gastroenteritis or gastritis
resulting from the medications
{{ However, if fever follows, an acute abdominal pain
episode for 1–3 days—possibility of localized or
generalized peritonitis/liver abscess or some other
inflammatory pathology of the abdomen or even chest

•

Loose motions: note the content of loose motions:
If feculent—more chances of enteritis/colitis
{{ If mucoid—need to consider surgical causes
Bleeding per rectum:
{{ In infants—typical currant jelly stools (mucoid mixed
with blood): high chances of intussusception
{{ If content is predominantly altered blood with mild
colics, consider bleeding due to a Meckel’s diverticulum
{{ After 2 years of age—mild bleeding with feces with
abdominal pain (not severe)—there is possibility
of rectal juvenile polyps leading to localized intus­
susception
Dysuria:
{{ In case with lateralized colics—renal colics
{{ If right-sided pain with dysuria, the possibility of acute
appendicitis with ipsilateral ureteric/vesical irritation
can be a possibility and needs to be ruled out
A history of recent trauma may indicate the cause of pain
{{ Additional history:
–– Cough or shortness of breath, and chest pain point
to a thoracic source
–– Polyuria and polydipsia suggest diabetes mellitus
–– Joint pain, rash, and smoke-colored urine suggest
Henoch-Schönlein purpura
–– High fever with toxicity acute hemolytic syndromes
like malaria/dengue which may mimic an acute
abdomen
–– Medication: a detailed drug history especially
salicylates/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/
steroids
–– Gynecologic history: relevant especially in adoles­
cent girls
{{

•

Past history: all previous hospitalizations or significant illnesses,
e.g., sickle cell anemia/porphyria. A history of previous surgery
or peritonitis may suggest adhesive obstruction.
Family history: family history of sickle cell/or cystic fibrosis
may indicate the diagnosis.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
General Examination
A throat examination to identify enlarged tonsils leading to
a swallowed gastrointestinal infection, a chest examination
to rule out a pleural/pulmonary pathology is important
complimentary clinical guide.

Gait
While a child with colics writhes with pain, children with
peritonitis remain quite still and resist movement. A patient
with acute appendicitis typically walks with a stoop to the right.

Vital Signs
Dehydration (severity needs to be assesed), fever if any.
Kussmaul’s respiration indicates diabetic ketoacidosis.

617

SECTION 15: Pediatric Surgery

Abdominal Examination
The abdominal movements should be observed, and the
patient should be asked to distend the abdomen and then
flatten it. Restricted abdominal movements indicate a
peritoneal irritation in that area:
• Visible contusions would suggest a traumatic etiology
• A definite examination of the hernial orifices is mandatory
in any case of acute abdominal pain since a strangulated
hernia may present as an acute abdomen (Fig. 2)
• Mottling of the abdomen may indicate an inflammatory
etiology especially in a neonate (Fig. 1)
• Tenderness of abdomen needs to be evaluated with the
palmar (flat) surface of the fingers rather than the tips
of the fingers (Figs 3 and 4). In a crying child, it is best
evaluated between breaths whereas other children may
be asked to take deep breaths with an open mouth to relax
the abdominal muscles. Since smaller children are not
able to localize parietal pain well, guarding/rigidity is more
relevant than tenderness
• Deeper palpation is necessary to discover masses and
organomegaly

Fig. 4: Avoidance of palpating the abdomen with the tips of the
fingers

•

A per rectal examination may reveal a loaded rectum
leading to constipation and abdominal pain/a bogginess
in the pelvis indicative of a peritonitis/blood in the rectum
or a palpable rectal polyp.

•

computed tomography may be necessary if excessive
bowel gas precludes ultrasonographic examination
Diagnostic laparoscopy: it is increasingly being used
prior to a surgical intervention and thus avoids a formal
laparotomy in selected cases. Some of these may include
acute appendicitis, Henoch-Schonlein pupura, Meckels’
diverticulitis, idiopathic omental necrosis, diagnosing a
nonviable bowel, loop, etc. (Figs 9–11).

Specific Conditions Causing Acute Abdomen Pain
The specific conditions causing acute abdomen pain are given
in table 3.

Infantile Colic
Fig. 6: Double-bubble shadow of duodenal obstruction

Infantile colic affects about 20% of infants during the first few
months of life. Typically, the affected children scream, draw
their knees up against their abdomen, and appear to be in

619

SECTION 15: Pediatric Surgery
severe pain. There may be associated symptoms like vomiting;
however, this is rarely persistent. Most infantile colics subside
within a few hours. The closest differential which one needs to
be aware of and needs to be eliminated is intussusception and
volvulus with malrotation. In case of persistence of symptoms
beyond 1–2 hours or in case of bilious vomiting, bleeding per
rectum, an abdominal ultrasonography should be asked for as
a screening test.

Gastroenteritis

Fig. 9: Laparoscopic view of gangrenous bowel

Gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of
abdominal pain in children. Vomiting and/or diarrhea
are usually associated and there may also be fever.
Differentiation from an intussusception is done by the fact
that in intussusception, the stools usually does not contain
fecal matter after one or two motions and there is only blood
and/or mucus.

Appendicitis

Fig. 10: Laparoscopic view of an acutely inflamed appendix (covered
with surrounding omentum

Appendicitis is the most common surgical condition in
children with acute abdomen.
Western literature places the incidence as approximately
1 in 15 persons. While older children may show the classical
pain—vomiting-fever chronology, younger children may
present directly as peritonitis. Most children have the pain
mainly in the periumbilical area with a few vomits and the
pain then shifts to the right side only after localized peritonitis
sets in. In spite of the various investigative modalities, acute
appendicitis still remains a clinical diagnosis and investigations
only have a supportive role.
Mesenteric lymphadenitis often mimics appendicitis.
Being primarily an adenoviral infection, fever is a more
prominent symptom. Generalized lymphadenopathy on
abdominal ultrasonography may be a feature with high fever
may suggest the same.

CHAPTER 126: Evaluation of Acute Abdominal Pain in Children

Abdominal Trauma
Abdominal trauma can be accidental or intentional. There
may be a bowel perforation, intramural hematoma, laceration,
or hematoma of the liver or spleen, and avulsion of intraabdominal organs or vascular pedicles. These patients may
benefit from an abdominal computed tomography scan
in addition to an abdominal ultrasonography. Diagnostic
laparoscopy has a definite role in selected patients.
Intussusception is common around 8–10 months of age
and occurs due to a hypertrophied Peyer’s patch (acting as a
lead point). Such a hypertrophy may occur due to a change in
the bacterial flora during weaning or gastrointestinal infection
or due to ingestion of infected respiratory secretions.
Clinically:
• There may be a prior history of an upper respiratory tract
infection
• Colics: pain occurs in short bursts with intermittent periods
of remission
• Vomiting: bilious only in late cases
• Red currant jelly stools: usually with no fecal matter after
1–2 times (a differentiating feature from dysentery)
• On abdominal palpation: intussusception may be felt
as banana-shaped mass with the concavity toward the
umbilicus. Occasionally the mass can be felt per rectally
• In late cases: features of septicemia and peritonitis.
Investigations:
• Ultrasound of the abdomen can be diagnostic
• Alternatively, a barium enema: the coiled spring sign or the
claw sign.

Intestinal Obstruction
Intestinal obstruction is uncommon in older children unless
there is a previous history of abdominal surgery. Additional
causes include volvulus, intussusception, incarcerated hernia,
congenital, or postinflammatory bands including intestinal
tuberculosis. An erect abdominal X-ray would be diagnostic in
most cases. A trial of conservative management under surgical
supervision may be indicated in case there is no suspicion
of bowel ischemia. Pain not responding to antispasmodics,
tender/palpable loop of bowel, evidence of perforation/
ischemia on imaging, and failure of conservative treatment
for more than a few days will be indications for surgical
intervention.
Pelvic inflammatory disease or primary peritonitis is
typically seen in females and the diagnosis is more on laparo­
scopic/surgical exclusion of known causes of peritonitis.
Indications for surgical consultations in children with
acute abdominal pain:
• Severe or increasing abdominal pain with progressive signs
of deterioration
• Bile-stained or feculent vomitus
• Involuntary abdominal guarding/rigidity
• Rebound abdominal tenderness

•
•
•
•
•

Marked abdominal distension with diffuse tympany
Signs of acute fluid or blood loss into the abdomen
Significant abdominal trauma
Suspected surgical cause for the pain
Abdominal pain without an obvious etiology.

Clinical Pearls
• In the acute surgical abdomen, pain generally precedes
vomiting, while the reverse is true in medical conditions
• While a child with colics writhes with pain, children with
peritonitis remain quite still and resist movement
• Bilious vomiting at almost any age signifies an intestinal
obstruction unless proved otherwise.
• Constipation following vomiting and abdominal pain—more
likely surgical
• If fever follows an acute abdominal pain episode for 1–3 days—
possibility of localized or generalized peritonitis or some other
inflammatory pathology
• Restricted abdominal movements indicate a peritoneal
irritation in that area
• A definite examination of the hernial orifices is mandatory in
any case of acute abdomen
• A patient with acute appendicitis typically walks with a stoop
to the right.

Management of Undescended
Testis: Cryptorchidism
Rasik S Shah, Suyodhan A Reddy, Nachiket M Joshi

INTRODUCTION
Undescended testis (UDT) or cryptorchidism is the most
common congenital abnormality of the genitourinary tract. It
comprises of true cryptorchid or UDT, ectopic testis, absent
testis, atrophic testis, retractile testis, and ascended testis. It is
important to differentiate the aforementioned conditions, as
their individual management is different.

TERMINOLOGY
•
•

•

•
•

•

Cryptorchidism: cryptorchidism, by definition, means
absence of one or both testis in the scrotum
True UDT: the testis, which has failed to descend along its
normal pathway from the retroperitoneum to the scrotum,
is known as true UDT. If the testis remains in abdominal
cavity then it is known as abdominal UDT; if it comes out
of internal ring and goes back to the abdomen, then it is
known as emergent UDT; if it is in inguinal canal, then it
is known as intracanalicular UDT; if it is just outside the
external ring, then it is known as suprascrotal UDT.
Ectopic testis: the testis, which has normally descended
from retroperitoneum up to the external ring subsequently
gets deviated to an aberrant position, is known as ectopic
testis. It may be palpable in the superficial inguinal pouch
(most common), suprapubic region, femoral triangle,
or perineum. Rarely, testis travels via opposite internal
ring into contralateral scrotal compartment and then it is
known as transverse testicular ectopia.
Absent testis: testis which embryologically has failed to
develop is known as absent testis.
Atrophic testis: the testis was developed normally and
at some stage, it has undergone atrophy secondary to
vascular compromise. If it occurs in the prenatal period,
then it is also known as the vanishing testis syndrome or
testicular regression syndrome.
Retractile testis: the testis normally descends to the
scrotum at birth; however, the hyperactive cremasteric

•

reflex pulls the testis into suprascrotal position. This testis
can be manipulated into a dependent scrotal position, by
making the patient relax his cremasteric muscle. The testis
will remain there as long as the cremasteric muscles are
relaxed.
Ascended testis: the testis, which has been documented
to be in the scrotum in neonatal period, is found to be at
higher position in later childhood is known as the ascended
testicle.

PATHOGENESIS
The factors responsible for normal testicular descent are not
well understood. The intra-abdominal phase of descent is
thought to be androgen-independent and is mediated by a
polypetide “descendin”. The testis passes through the inguinal
canal in 28th week of gestation; it is believed to be the combined
result of interactions between mechanical, hormonal, and
neurotransmitters. Changes in abdominal pressure, patency of
the processus vaginalis, gubernacular regression, androgens,
gonadotropins, Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS), and
calcitonin gene-related peptide are all thought to play a role.
The pathogenesis of UDT is less understood than that of
normal testicular descent. Alterations in any of the factors
that contribute to normal testicular descent may theoretically
result in UDT. Gonadotropin deficiencies in utero, decreased
MIS, and increased expression of estradiol in the placenta have
been proposed as contributing factors.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
At birth, 2–5% of full-term and 25–30% of premature male
infants are born with an UDT. Of these, in approximately 70%,
the testis descends spontaneously within first 2–3 months of
life and is unlikely to descend after 3 months. At 1 year of age,
the prevalence of UDT is around 0.8–1%, which is similar to
that in adults.

CHAPTER 127: Management of Undescended Testis: Cryptorchidism

COMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELS

The prevalence of UDT varies geographically, which may
be due to genetics or environmental factors. Prematurity, being
small for gestational age at birth, and birth weight less than
2.5 kg are common risk factor. Prenatal exposure to endocrine
disruptors (e.g., diethylstilbestrol, pesticides) also has been
associated with cryptorchidism in some studies.

Complications and sequels of UDT include inguinal hernia,
testicular torsion, testicular trauma, subfertility, and testicular
cancer. The potential seriousness of these complications and
sequels demands early referral for definitive treatment (Box 2).

Associated Conditions

Inguinal Hernia

Cryptorchidism usually is an isolated finding. However, it
may occur in association with endocrine disorders, genetic
syndromes, and morphologic abnormalities, especially if it is
bilateral. Associated conditions are shown in box 1.

The UDT have an associated patent processus vaginalis in
about 60% cases. Inguinal hernia in UDT can present at any
age with the typical symptoms or complications, including
incarceration.

Clinical Pearl
• Patients having undescended testis and hypospadias have
high incidence of underlying disorders of sexual development.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Clinical features of cryptorchidism include an empty,
hypoplastic, hypopigmented, and poorly developed rugae of
scrotum or hemiscrotum. Inguinal fullness may be present.
In approximately 10%, it is a bilateral condition. Bilateral
UDT are more commonly associated with other conditions.
Unilateral UDT is more common on left side.
The most common location for an UDT is just outside the
external ring (superficial inguinal pouch), followed by the
inguinal canal (intracanalicular), and finally intra-abdominal.
The testis is not palpable in 20% of patients with UDT.
The growth of unilateral UDT is impaired compared
with the normally descended contralateral testis, whether it
descends spontaneously or it is surgically brought in scrotum.
Treatment before 1 year of age is associated with partial catchup of growth.

Testicular Torsion
Testicular torsion is approximately ten times more common in
UDT than in normal scrotal testis, but the true relative risk is
not known. The rate of salvage of torsion in cryptorchid testis
is decreased compared to that in normally descended testis,
perhaps related to delay in diagnosis.
If patient with inguinal testis develops the torsion, then he
will present with local swelling and tenderness with an empty
ipsilateral hemiscrotum. If patient with intra-abdominal testis
develops torsion, then he will present as an acute abdomen
with empty one side of scrotum and usually diagnosis of
torsion is made only at the time of abdominal exploration.

Testicular Trauma
Testis located in the inguinal canal is at increased risk of blunt
traumatic injury from compression against the pubic bone.

Subfertility
Men with a history of UDT have lower sperm counts, sperms
of poorer quality, and lower fertility rates than men with
normally descended testis. Impaired spermatogenesis is
probably related to underlying genetic, hormonal, and
developmental abnormalities, some of which may be partially
reversible through early surgical intervention. Sperm counts in
adulthood are directly related to prepubertal germ cell counts
and type of cell (gonocyte versus adult dark spermatogonia) at
the time of orchidopexy. The local milieu reduces the number
of Leydig cells, which produce testosterone. Testosterone plays
an important role in maturation of gonocyte to dark adult
spermatogonia. This affects both quality and quantity of the
mature germ cells in the testis.
The degree of germ cell dysfunction increases with bilateral
involvement and with increasing duration of suprascrotal
location. Intra-abdominal and intracanalicular UDT are
affected similarly, probably related to the damaging effect of
higher temperatures outside the scrotum on spermatogenesis.
Elevated serum gonadotropin [follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)] concen­
tration and

SECTION 15: Pediatric Surgery
decreased serum inhibin B concentration are endocrinologic
markers of testicular dysfunction.

Testicular Cancer
Men with a history of UDT have an increased risk of developing
testicular cancer compared with men in the general population
in whom the age adjusted incidence is approximately 5.4 per
100,000. The epidemiological data points toward a definite
relationship between the intrauterine, perinatal development
and UDT.
The risk of developing testicular cancer is further increased
in men with bilateral cryptorchidism (which may be associated
with endocrinologic abnormalities or abnormal karyotype)
and intra-abdominal UDT.
A history of cryptorchidism is also a risk factor for
developing intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified
type, a premalignant condition, which is also called carcinoma
in situ, or testicular intraepithelial neoplasia.
Surgical repositioning of the testis (orchidopexy) before
puberty appears to decrease the risk of testicular cancer, but
does not completely eliminate it. Testicular malposition is not
the only factor in the development of testicular cancer in men
with a history of cryptorchidism because surgical repositioning
does not completely eliminate the risk.

these investigations induce confusion in minds of parents. On
imaging, if the testis is not visualized and surgeon recommends
surgery, then they start thinking although that testis is not seen
and even then the surgeon still wishes to operate. If the surgeon
explains why surgery is essential, then the parents might raise
the query that if the surgeon has already decided to operate
upon then what was the need to doing imaging studies. In
order to avoid confusion, it is safer not to order investigations
for locating testis.
The goal is to bring the apparently normal looking testis
into the scrotum from its abnormal position and to prevent
the complications. It is essential to pex testes into scrotum to
prevent postoperative ascent. Small atrophic testes should be
removed.
The testis in scrotal position is less likely to undergo torsion
or blunt traumatic injury. In addition, it also permits easier selfexamination for early detection of malignancy. If orchidopexy
is performed early, it may reduce the risk of infertility and
testicular cancer. The testis in normal scrotal position is
likely to provide improved body satisfaction, although the
psychological impact of abnormal testicular position has not
been studied.
Hormonal therapy has been tried in past, but it has not
proven to be efficacious in inducing testicular descent.

Bilateral Undescended Testis

Clinical Pearl
• Children who has been operated for orchidopexy should
be taught self-examination for early detection of testicular
carcinoma.

MANAGEMENT
The patients of UDT should be worked up for anesthesia fitness
preoperatively. Other hormonal investigations are optional
and may be performed depending upon local institutional
policy. Imaging studies for locating testis are not required,
as they have limited specificity and sensitivity. In addition,

If the patients have bilateral palpable UDT without hypo­
spadias, then they should be operated after the age of 6
months. If the patients have bilateral nonpalpable UDT or
if UDT is associated with hypospadias, then they should
be investigated for disorders of sex differentiation (DSD).
If investigations are in line of a normal boy, then the
orchidopexy should be performed after the age of 6 months.
Authors operate on both sides in the same sitting even when
they are nonpalpable, though some institutes have protocol
of operating on one side first and then on other side. If
investigations are suggestive of DSD, then one should follow
DSD protocol (Algorithm 1).

CHAPTER 127: Management of Undescended Testis: Cryptorchidism

Surgical Treatment

Nonpalpable Testis

Timing of surgery: The spontaneous descent is less likely to
occur after 3 months of age and it has recommended that
children with UDT should be operated as soon as possible
after 6 months of age to prevent the complications. In children
with ascended testicle, surgery should be performed as soon as
possible after diagnosis is established.
Early orchidopexy before 2 years (ideally before 1 year) of
age is associated with improved testicular growth and fertility
potential.
If a patient with UDT presents with inguinal hernia,
then orchidopexy with repair of inguinal hernia should be
performed at the time of presentation (Algorithm 2).

The nonpalpable testis can be abdominal, atrophic, or
absent. It is difficult to differentiate between these conditions
pre­
operatively and parents of these patients should be
explained about possible outcome of surgery, i.e., single stage
orchidopexy, two stage orchidopexy, or orchiectomy depending
upon the operative findings. Even patients with nonpalpable
UDT can be operated as a day care surgery, but they need to be
preferably scheduled as first case in the morning.
The first step is to perform examination under anesthesia
and if testis is palpable, then to proceed with standard open
orchidopexy. If the testis is confirmed to be not palpable, then
proceed with the next step, i.e., laparoscopic surgery.
Following are the advantages of laparoscopic surgery over
open procedure in nonpalpable UDT:
• Probability of missing the high testis and testis in abnormal
position (retrovesical) is almost nil
• Laparoscopic mobilization of testicular vessels is far
superior as compared to open mobilization. The incidence
of postoperative ascent and atrophy is less common
compare to open surgery.
In a place, where option of laparoscopic pediatric surgery
is not available, surgeon may proceed with open surgery by
lower inguinal crease incision. If the testis is not found in the
groin, then the peritoneal exploration may be performed by
extending the groin incision laterally or to reverse the patient
from anesthesia and refer the patient to the higher center.
If cord structures or testicular remnants are found, they are
removed and the procedure is terminated.
The diagnostic laparoscopy is a safe procedure in
experienced hands. The laparoscope is placed via the
umbilicus and following observations are carried out, patency
of the processus vaginalis, location of testis, testicular vessels,
vas deferens, gubernaculum, and presence of Müllerian
structures. The findings on laparoscopy decide the further plan
of action (Algorithm 3).
The presence of blind ending vas and vessels in the
retroperitoneum (usually 2–3 cm proximal to the internal ring)
is suggestive of vanishing testis syndrome. In this situation,
nothing further needs to be done for the UDT, though fixation of
contralateral testis to prevent torsion and loss of only testicular
tissue remains controversial at present. Authors routinely

Clinical Pearl
• Orchidopexy should be performed any time after the age of
6 months, the earlier the better to prevent its complications.
Undescended testes presenting with inguinal hernia should
be operated at the time of diagnosis.

Palpable Testis
Patients with palpable UDT should undergo open orchi­
dopexy. The surgery is usually carried out as a day care
procedure under laryngeal mask and caudal anesthesia.
An incision is taken in the lower skin crease in the groin.
The testis along with the cord structures are mobilized,
herniotomy (if hernial sac is present) is performed and testis
is manipulated into the scrotum and sutured in place. Usually
palpable testis can be brought down to the scrotum as the cord
structures have adequate length. Sometimes, even palpable
(especially emergent) UDT has short cord and they may
not come down to scrotum without tension and can ascend
postoperatively into higher position needing second surgery.
The exact incidence of such a scenario has not been reported,
but it is likely to be in range of 2–3% (personal experience).

Clinical Pearl
• Palpable undescended testes (UDT) should undergo open
surgery and nonpalpable UDT should undergo laparoscopic
surgery

fix the contralateral testis in such a scenario. In addition, if
facilities are available, then surgeon can insert the testicular
prosthesis on the ipsilateral side at the time of surgery or later
on at puberty. If the prosthesis is inserted in a young child,
then it may need to be revised at the time of puberty to match
the normal contralateral testicular size. The psychological
assessment of these young adults with or without prosthesis
has not been performed, but logically the person with normal
feel of scrotum is likely to have better self-esteem.
On laparoscopy, if vas and vessels are entering internal ring,
then patient is likely to have atrophic testis either in the inguinal
canal or in the scrotum. This patient should undergo excision of
atrophic testicle either laparoscopically (if hernial sac is open
and atrophic testis is visualized) or by an open inguinal incision
along with fixation of contralateral testis by scrotal incision to
prevent torsion and loss of only testicular tissue.
On laparoscopy, if apparently normal looking testis is seen,
then surgeon needs to decide whether to bring the testis to
scrotum in one or two operations. This decision is based on
following factors:
• Age of patient
• Distance of testis from the internal ring
• Mobility of testicular vessels.
In infants, length of the inguinal canal is much shorter than
the older children and it is easy to bring the testis in scrotum.
The term low abdominal testis is used when the distance of
testis from the internal ring is less than 2.5 cm (Fig. 1). The
term high abdominal testis is used when the distance of testis
from internal ring is more than 2.5 cm. In children who are less
than 5 years old with low abdominal testis and mobile vessels,
usually the testis can be brought down in single operation. The
success rate of single stage orchidopexy is more than 95%.
The children with high abdominal testis, age more
than 5 years, and short testicular vessels usually needs two
stage Stephen-Fowler (SF) orchidopexy. In the first stage,
the testicular vessels are controlled either using bipolar
diathermy, clipped or with an ultrasonic scalpel and then
transected. This is performed approximately 2.5 cm away
from the testis. This allows the development of collaterals
between artery to vas deferens and testicular vessels (Fig. 2).

internal ring

orchidopexy showing collaterals between artery to vas deferens and

CHAPTER 127: Management of Undescended Testis: Cryptorchidism
The second stage SF orchidopexy is usually performed after 6
months, wherein the testis is brought down to scrotum on the
pedicle of vas. The two stage orchidopexy has success rate of
more than 80%.
In past for high abdominal testis, microvascular surgery
was performed by anastomosis of testicular artery with inferior
epigastric artery but has limited success and is not popular.

of age and in up to 26% of cases who underwent orchidopexy in
the age group 4–14 years of age. The timing of the surgery does
not influence fertility in unilateral cryptorchidism. Though
the fertility is not impaired, there are distinct benefits of early
surgical orchidopexy.

Retractile Testis

Clinical Pearl

Adult men with history of UDT have higher probability
of developing a testicular malignancy. The risk increases
to 32 fold in comparison to the general population. The
intra-abdominal testis has the highest risk of developing
malignancy, which is five times higher than that of inguinal
UDT. The risk of malignancy is higher in bilateral UDT. The
children who undergo orchidopexy after puberty are twice
at the risk of developing the malignancy than those who
undergo orchidopexy before puberty. The incidence of
malignant degeneration in contralateral descended testis is
about 8–15%.

• Retractile testis needs a close supervision and 32% becomes
ascended testicle needing surgery.

KEY POINTS

A retractile testes should be under careful surveillance. The
probability of spontaneous descent is 58 % in boys older
than 7 years and 21% in boys younger than 7 years. It has 32%
risk of becoming an ascending UDT. Surgical repositioning
of the testis should be done if the testes become ascended
testes (acquired cryptorchidism) or there is significant loss of
testicular volume in comparison to contralateral testes.

Malignancy

))
One percent of male child suffers from undescended testes

Ascended Testicle
Ascended testicle should be surgically positioned at the time
of presentation. Ascended testes are seen in mid-childhood,
are usually unilateral, and are present in distal inguinal canal.
Ascended testis is prone to the same germ cell maldevelopment
seen in congenital cryptorchidism.

LONG-TERM OUTCOME OF
THE ORCHIDOPEXY
Testicular Atrophy
Testicular atrophy is a serious negative outcome of the
orchidopexy. It is reported in 1% in ectopic testis, up to 5% of the
distal testis, and in up to 9% of cases in intra-abdominal testis.
The preoperative location of testes, torsion, and anomalies of
vas deferens determines the occurrence of postorchidopexy
testicular atrophy. Inadvertent trauma to the testicular vessels,
postoperative edema, and local infections may also play a role
in testicular atrophy. The resultant postoperative ischemia
leads to complete or partial atrophy of the testis.

Fertility
Adults with bilateral UDT have azoospermia in almost 100%
of cases, while more than 20% adults will have normal sperm
counts when their orchidopexy was done in early childhood.
Adults who underwent orchidopexy generally have low sperm
count and have poor semen quality. This subfertility is not
completely compensated by the contralateral descended
testis. The fertility is further compromised if both testes are
undescended and if the treatment is delayed. In bilateral UDT,
the studies quotes normal sperm counts in up to 76% of cases
when the orchidopexy was done between 10 months and 4 years

Acute Scrotum
Mohan K Abraham

INTRODUCTION
Acute scrotum is an alarming condition both for the parents
and the child. Since the most common cause in children is
torsion of the testis, emergency management is indicated.
Epididymo-orchitis and trauma can also present as acute
scrotum. However, these conditions are rarer and torsion
should be ruled out first.

DEFINITION
Any sudden swelling of the scrotum, unilateral or bilateral with
redness and edema, should be considered as acute scrotum.

ETIOLOGY
Etiology can be divided into infective causes like epididymoorchitis, allergic causes like idiopathic scrotal edema or
ischemic causes like torsion testis and torsion of the appendages
of the testis. Epididymo-orchitis is usually due to ascending
infection through the vas because of a urinary tract infection.
There are two peaks when torsion of the testis occurs; one is in
the new born period and another at puberty. Lack of fixation in
the new born period and over activity of the cremaster muscle
has been attributed to the increased incidence during these
periods. Torsion is mostly extravaginal in the new born period
where the twist occurs in the cord. Torsion is intravaginal in
the rest of life. Intravaginal torsion is due to high investment
of tunica vaginalis which gives rise to a bell clapper deformity.
Here, the mesentery of the testis is narrow and testis hangs
like a bell-clapper in a church bell predisposing it to torsion.
The appendages of the testis can also undergo torsion when
signs and symptoms are minimal. Idiopathic scrotal edema
is another condition that mimics acute scrotum. Absence of
tenderness and normal testis felt on palpation or a normal
testis without edema and good blood flow seen by ultrasound
distinguishes this from other conditions.

CLINICAL FEATURES
History
History gives a clue in most of the conditions. Pain of sudden
onset may indicate torsion. Torsion is commonly seen in
postpubertal or new born age. Torsion of appendages of the
testis occurs in the prepubertal age. History of trauma does
not rule out torsion. If pain from trauma lasts more than 1
hour, torsion should be considered. History of urinary tract
infection, surgery for hypospadias, or sexual activity may be
obtained in epididymo-orchitis. Fever also may be present
in case of epididymo-orchitis. Pain of epididymo-orchitis is
gradual in onset. Henoch–Schönlein purpura can also present
with acute scrotum, but the lesions in other parts of the body
will point to the diagnosis. Obstructed hernia can also mimic
acute scrotum. History of a reducible swelling existing before
the onset of acute scrotum will point to the diagnosis.

Clinical Examination
It is important to gain the confidence of the child or mildly
sedate the child before starting the examination. This will
facilitate proper examination. Abdominal examination
including the inguinal area should be done first. Incarcerated
hernia will have a swelling extending into the inguinal canal. A
thickened and tender spermatic cord in the inguinal canal will
indicate epididymo-orchitis.

Examination of the Scrotum
In idiopathic scrotal edema, both the sides are involved but
tenderness is absent. In torsion and epididymo-orchitis, the
involvement is unilateral to start with and becomes bilateral
as time passes. A testis felt in the root of the scrotum or a
testis with a transverse lie should warn about the possibility of
torsion. Absence of cremasteric reflex indicates torsion. This
is elicited by stroking the medial side of the thigh which gives

demonstrate any difference in tissue saturation between
testis that had undergone torsion and normal testis.

Clinical Pearl
• There is no investigation that is completely reliable to rule out
torsion in a reasonable time frame.

MANAGEMENT
Epididymo-orchitis
Empirical antibiotics are given till urine culture and sensitivity
is obtained. Bed rest and scrotal elevation will lessen the pain.
If urine culture is positive, then child will need further work up
to look for any underlying anatomical abnormality.
Fig. 1: Showing red edematous scrotum on left side due to torsion

rise to ipsilateral elevation of testis because of the contraction
of cremaster muscle. Pain duration less than 24 hours, nausea
or vomiting, a high position of the testis, and an abnormal
cremasteric reflex has a positive predictive value for torsion.
Testis should be examined carefully. Testis should be held
between thumb and two fingers. Epididymis should be felt
as a soft linear structure on the posterior lateral aspect of the
testis. If this is tender and swollen, then epididymitis should be
thought of. Tenderness limited to the upper pole of the testis
suggests torsion of the appendage of the testis. A small area
of bluish discoloration at the upper pole, also known as blue
dot sign, also represents torsion of an appendage of the testis.
Testis is swollen and tender in early torsion and epididymoorchitis. Tenderness may disappear once complete gangrene
of the testis has set in. As time passes, the erythema and edema
involves both sides of the scrotum (Fig. 1). Palpation of the
testis will reveal a hard enlarged testis on the affected side.
Elevation of testis may give relief of pain in case of
epididymo-orchitis, but not in torsion.

INVESTIGATIONS
•
•

•

630

•

Urine analysis: if pyuria is present, it may suggest
epididymo-orchitis
Ultrasound: conventional ultrasound has not been
found useful. Color Doppler has improved the diagnostic
accuracy in expert hands. However, Doppler may miss a
partial torsion which will eventually lead to testicular loss.
A hypervascular enlarged epididymis can occur in 5% of
torsion cases. Color Doppler can avoid surgery in cases
of increased or normal blood flow; in rest of the cases,
exploration may be needed
Nuclear scanning: nuclear scanning is highly accurate in
demonstrating torsion as a photopenic area. However, this
is not widely available and consumes time which may lead
to testicular gangrene. Moreover, it gives a small dose of
radiation also
Near infrared spectroscopy: though some usefulness
was seen in animal studies, in human studies it failed to

Idiopathic Scrotal Edema
Bed rest and scrotal elevation will be enough. Edema will
subside in 48–72 hours.

Torsion of Testis
Points to consider in the management of torsion are:
• Duration of torsion. Some studies have shown that
testicular atrophy occurred in all cases where the symptom
duration was more than 24 hours
• Triggering of immune mechanism because of loss of
blood testicular barrier due to ischemia is a matter of
concern. This can result in damage to the normal testis
and infertility.
Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and no time
should be wasted between diagnosis and exploration. Scrotal
exploration is done and the testis is fixed to the dartos with
nonabsorbable sutures. Alternatively, it can be put in a dartos
pouch to prevent torsion. However, suture fixation has the
potential danger of violating testicular barrier and triggering
an immune response damaging the contralateral testis.
Contralateral side also needs to be fixed to prevent torsion
because the bell clapper deformity can be bilateral. There is
some controversy regarding the fixation of the contralateral
testis in newborn torsion. Neonatal torsions are usuallyextra
vaginal and bilateral involvements are not usually seen in these
cases. However, most surgeons favor fixing the contralateral
side since bilateral torsions are known to occur. If testis is
found to be ischemic as evidenced by dark discoloration, testis
should be detorsed and warm sponges applied to see if there is
regaining of color (Fig. 2). If there is no improvement in color,
testis can be incised to see the state of testicular tissue inside. If
the testis is found to be gangrenous, orchiectomy is indicated.
Contralateral side testis should be fixed in the dartos pouch to
prevent torsion.
Drugs have been studied in experimental animal models
to reduce the ischemia reperfusion injury. These include
allopurinol, calcium channel blockers, oxypurinol, and super­
oxide dismutase. But, none of these studies have produced
enough evidence to allow its usage in human beings.

Perinatal Torsion
Management of perinatal torsion is controversial. One school
of thought considers that salvage of a perinatally torted testis is
very poor so that there is no need for emergency exploration.
Other school of thought wants to give the benefit of the doubt
and explore the testis since there is a possibility that torsion has
occurred during or immediately after delivery and potential for
salvage of the testis is higher.

Torsion of the Appendages of Testis
Torsion of the appendages of testis as evidenced by blue
dot sign is conservatively managed with bed rest and antiinflammatory drugs are justifiable. But, this is usually possible
only in fair skinned children and that too if they present
before scrotal edema develops. If doubt exists, exploration
is the safer option. Exploration of contralateral side is not
indicated (Fig. 3).

Testicular Trauma
Testicular trauma occurs as a result of direct blow to the
testis or straddle injury. Post-traumatic epididymo-orchitis
occurs within a few days after trauma. This has noninfectious
cause and can be managed with scrotal elevation and rest.
Intratesticular hematoma can also be managed conservatively.
However, rupture of the testis will require emergency surgery.

Clinical Pearl
• Epididymo-orchitis in childen should be a postoperative
diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

Torsion testis should be suspected in every case of acute
scrotum

doubt

In the absence of predisposing causes for epidydimo-orchitis

Per-rectal Bleeding
Dasmit S Khokar

INTRODUCTION
Lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is an alarming symptom
of presentation. Among children of all ages, lower GI bleeding
is the main symptom in 0.3% of patients presenting to the
casualty; 50% are less than 1 year of age. Per-rectal bleeding
accounts for 10–15% of referrals to a gastrointestinal service.
In most children, bleeding stops spontaneously but since
the blood volume is small, resuscitation must begin early.
Children can tolerate even massive blood loss surprisingly well,
but sudden deterioration occurs when a critical point is reached.
At the outset, it is imperative to remember the thumb
rule that age-appropriate tachycardia is the most sensitive
indicator of critical blood loss in children. Any patient with an
estimated blood loss more than 10% of the blood volume must
be monitored in an intensive care unit.
Twenty percent patients in the neonatal intensive care unit
are likely to experience stress gastritis with resultant coffee
grounds in the nasogastric aspirate followed thereafter by
malena.

Clinical Classification
•

Hematochezia: fresh bleeding per rectum in large
quantities. Clots plus fresh blood may be seen, hardly any
stool matter
• Malena: usually a sign of bleeding that comes from a source
proximal to the ligament of Treitz. However, massive upper
GI bleeding can produce bright red blood per rectum if GI
transit time is rapid
• Red currant jelly stools: blood mixed with mucus
• Maroon colored stool: occurs with distal small bowel
bleeding, such as with Meckel’s diverticulum.
• Blood mixed with loose stools: infective diarrhea, dysentery.
Painless bleeding in an otherwise healthy child will be
construed differently from per-rectal bleeding in a sick child,
irrespective of the quantity of bleeding.

ch-129.indd 632

Etiology
The most common causes of bleeding vary with the age at
presentation, although almost all causes may be encountered
at any age.
Neonates:
• Healthy baby: hemolytic disease of the newborn, fissure in
ano, local trauma (as happens with an attempted forced
catheter insertion into the rectum)
• Sick baby: necrotizing enterocolitis, bowel gangrene, sepsis,
disseminated intravascular coagulation, Hirschsprung’s
disease with enterocolitis, complicated malrotation, milk
or soya milk enterocolitis, or allergic colitis.
• Drugs causing GI bleeds include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indomethacin, tolazoline,
heparin, etc.
• Some maternal medications like cephalothin, aspirin, and
phenobarbital can cross the placenta and cause per-rectal
bleeding in the neonate after delivery
• Preemies and ventilated babies are prone to stress gastritis
with resultant malena
• Idiopathic.
Up to 2 years of age:
• Milk protein allergy
• Intussusception
• Fissure in ano
• Rectal polyps
• Malrotation
• Hemangioma and other vascular lesions of the gut
• Intestinal duplication
• Trauma due to foreign body or sexual assault
• Lymphonodular hyperplasia
• Eosinophilic gastroenteropathy
• Acquired thrombocytopenia
• Infectious diarrhea.
Elder than 2 years age:
• Infectious diarrhea

Bleeding related to defecation: anal or rectal lesion is likely
Bleeding associated with pain: lesion is below the dentate
line
Blood mixed with stool matter: lesion is higher than the
rectum
Something coming out of the anus: rectal prolapse or rectal
polyp, intussusception
Bleeding associated with epigastric pain and heartburn:
dyspepsia/gastritis
Bleeding associated with high fever: enteric fever with
terminal ileitis
Bleeding associated with loss of weight, anorexia, night
sweats, and fatigue: abdominal tuberculosis

•

Colicky pain followed by red-currant jelly stools: intus­
susception
• Copious bleeding, usually painless or lower abdominal
pain followed by hematochezia: meckel’s diverticulum
and duplication of the gut
• Abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, prostration: infective
ulceration
• Bleeding associated with abdominal distention in a septic
child: intestinal gangrene, necrotizing enterocolitis.
In spite of extensive investigations, the cause may not be
found in which case it is labeled as idiopathic. Munchausen
syndrome by proxy should also be ruled out.

Investigations
•

•
•

•

•

Digital rectal examination: it is the most essential primary
investigation that is needed when a child presents with
such a history. Hard fecalomas, anal stenosis, fissure in
ano, rectal polyps, mass lesion prolapsed from above, etc.
can be judged quite accurately. It is possible to differentiate
between advanced colonic intussusception and rectal
prolapse, judging by the depth to which the palpating
finger can be inserted. In addition, rectal tone should
always be assessed
Ultrasonography abdomen: mass lesions can be detected
as long as the bowel gas does not interfere with the medium
of passage of the ultrasonic waves
Barium enema: larger polyps and multiple polyps can be
diagnosed quite easily with this investigation. However,
smaller polyps are easier to see on endoscopy besides
being amenable to biopsy also.
Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT)
abdomen: this is used judiciously so as to avoid radiation
to the child. This is a highly sensitive and specific imaging
technique for the abdomen. However, a trained pediatric
radio­logist is essential for interpreting the images accurately
Magnetic resonance imaging abdomen: this is being tried
as an alternative to CECT abdomen, but the resolution is
often insufficient to accurately make a diagnosis

•

Meckel’s radionuclide scan with technetium 99 m
pertechnetate: it can be used to detect the presence of a
Meckel’s diverticulum with ectopic gastric mucosa
• Red blood cell (RBC) labeled radionuclide scan: any
bleeding which is more than 0.1 mL/min can be detected
by this scan and the approximate location can be
established. Newer RBC scans have an accuracy of nearly
90% in localizing the bleeding site
• Colonoscopy, gastroscopy, and capsule endoscopy: these
are now being used with increasing frequency to try and
establish a diagnosis and avoid a surgical exploration.
The overall yield of colonoscopy is 64–80%. When rectal
bleeding is associated with diarrhea, the yield is 97%. In
children in the 0–12 years age group, colitis is the most
common cause (36%), followed by polyps in (27%), whereas
rectal ulcers, chronic anal fissures, and hemorrhoids
account for 5% each
• Splanchnic angiography (superior mesenteric arterio­
graphy): it is sometimes resorted to for locating the
bleeding vessel when the bleeding is massive. Even superselective embolization has been successful in select cases
although it can lead to bowel gangrene sometimes
• Laparoscopy: being minimally invasive, it is the last
resort short of a laparotomy, in a case where all other
investigations have been unable to come to a diagnosis
• Laparotomy: It is the last desperate attempt when a lifethreatening bleeding event happens. It has the advantage
of allowing palpation of the bowel wall, but one still cannot
view the mucosal aspect unless opened. The limitation is
that it is not possible to open and view the entire bowel.
The yield is therefore increased further when laparotomy
is coupled with transluminal endoscopy (enteroscopy). An
endoscope is inserted either through a natural orifice or
through an opening made in the bowel and guided by the
operating surgeon.
In most of the cases, if the GI endoscopies are negative, then
a period of observation is desirable. In case the patient bleeds
significantly or repeatedly, then more invasive investigations
become easier to justify. Many cases of idiopathic bleeding will
not last beyond a few months.
Many of the causes of lower GI bleeding are medical causes
and readers are directed to read appropriate source material
for the same.
Some of the more common surgical causes have been
discussed here in this chapter.

FISSURE IN ANO

634

This occurs due to trauma caused by passage of hard stools.
This is the most common cause of per-rectal bleeding in
India. Faulty diet is the usual cause of hard stools. Excessive
milk and bakery products like biscuits and bread are the usual
offenders. With increasing urbanization and break-down of the
joint family system, it is not unusual to obtain a history where
both parents are working, with lesser time at their disposal for
spending with their children. This fact directs them to resort
to appeasement methods to placate their demanding children,

ch-129.indd 634

coupled with short cut alternatives to preparing wholesome
food at home. Thus, children consume more fast foods, street
foods, single-pot meals, and high calorie foods with low
roughage value leading to constipation.
Another phenomenon seemingly on the rise is early,
enforced toilet-training. The child is made to pass stools like an
adult even before the sensation of passing stools or defecation
reflexes are fully developed. This leads to acquired constipation
with its ensuing complications one of which is fissure in ano.

Pathogenesis
The child strains and passes a hard stool. This hard bolus
causes a laceration at the mucocutaneous junction which is
extremely sensitive to pain. Any attempt by the child at passing
stools would now be very painful, so the child holds back the
stools. This leads to further water absorption from the stool
matter causing it to harden further. This vicious cycle causes
the fissure to become chronic. The aim of treatment is to break
this vicious cycle so that the fissure can heal on its own.
It is important to differentiate between acute and chronic
constipation when treating such children. Oral laxatives
should be used for acute constipation only, along with advice
on correction of diet. Oral laxatives are preferred for only acute
constipation and should never be used for prolonged periods.
Any patient, who needs an oral laxative for more than 7 days,
needs to be investigated further for the cause of constipation
and should be referred to a pediatric surgeon.
Patients with chronic constipation need prolonged bowel
training and should be managed by a suppository bowel
management program along with strict dietary correction.
Suppositories having a local action are less habit-forming and
are preferred over oral laxatives. Occasionally, soapy water
enemas and mineral oil or olive oil instillation are needed for
hard fecalomas. Phosphatic enemas can be used occasionally,
but daily usage should be avoided to prevent electrolyte
disturbances.

Clinical Presentation
The most common presentation is a painful passage of hard
stool accompanied by straining. This is followed by a few drops
of fresh blood. Passage of clots is unusual. Subsequent stools
are painful, streaked with blood on one side and few drops of
blood at the end of defecation.
The child might be habituated to passing stools in a
standing position, pressing the buttocks together in an attempt
to prevent the stools from exiting the painful anus. The face
turns red as the child strains excessively and looks quite
frightening to the parents. Finally, the child painfully passes a
hard mass of stool with a streak of blood on it.
The fissure can be seen on careful examination of the
perineum. The most common location is at the 6 o’clock
position but can occur in any position. A recurrent fissure at 12
o’clock position or in an older child should alert the physician
to the possibility of an inflammatory bowel disease.
Sometimes, a portion of the delicate anal valve can get
avulsed and protrude from the anus. This is called an external

Chapter 129: Per-rectal Bleeding
pile (although it is quite distinct from the usual piles). This
can get infected leading to further worsening of the pain and
tenderness.

Treatment
•

•

•
•
•
•
•

The most important step is to treat the underlying cause
of constipation as outlined above. Treating functional
or habitual constipation (acquired megacolon) is quite
difficult and the treatment may take anything from a few
months to a few years
Treatment of chronic constipation causing acquired
megacolon starts only after a mechanical cause like an
anorectal malformation has been ruled out. A bowel
training program is started which includes a suppository or
a nonelectrolytic enema regime with progressively reducing
frequency, coupled with a strict high-roughage dietary
program. This needs a very high degree of motivation of the
parents to implement it appropriately
Warm sitz bath twice a day
Local anesthetic ointment: (lignocaine jelly/proctosedyl)
application thrice a day
NSAIDS when needed
Antibiotics if an external pile shows evidence of infection
Almost all fissures will heal with this treatment. Very rarely,
if the fissure has become chronic and the conservative
regime fails, a surgical option may need to be considered.
Lord’s dilatation or a lateral anal sphincterotomy may then
be required under general anesthesia (GA).

INTUSSUSCEPTION
The most common age group of presentation of intussus­
ception is 6–8 months, mean being around 10 months of age.
The characteristic severe pain in abdomen accompanied
by facial pallor soon followed by red currant jelly stools
is pathognomonic of intussusception. The most common
location is ileocecocolic with a hypertrophied Peyer’s patch
being the lead point. Sometimes, this episode may be preceded
by an attack of acute gastroenteritis, so the clinician has to be
very vigilant in treating such cases.
Diagnosis is quite easily possible by a typical target sign
on an ultrasound examination of the abdomen in 97–100% of
patients. Alternatively, barium enema can also be used with
the additional advantage of being both diagnostic as well as
therapeutic.
In patients more than 2 years of age or a small bowel
intussusception, we have to bear in mind the possibility of a
leading point being a bowel lesion, such as polyp, leiomyoma
or a lymphoma, which may necessitate a bowel resection
with anastomosis and the specimen being subjected to
histopathological examination.

Treatment
Almost 95% of intussusceptions can be treated by hydrostatic
reduction and surgery is not needed. This can be done by either
using barium enema under an image intensifier fluoroscopy or

ch-129.indd 635

normal saline enema under ultrasonography control or even
gas reduction with air/oxygen depending on the facilities and
expertise available. Although many centers prefer the safetynet of doing the procedure without any sedation, midazolam
sedation (both intranasal as well as intravenous, 0.1 mg/kg)
can be used in centers equipped with the requisite facilities
and experience.
It must be remembered that intussusception recurs in
5–10% of children when reduced by nonoperative reduction
and 1–4% after operative reduction.
Hydrostatic reduction treatment of intussusception is
contraindicated in cases where peritonitis/gangrene has
already developed as evidenced by severe rebound tenderness
or rigidity of the abdomen.
Thus, early referral is crucial to a center equipped to handle
such cases and most cases referred within 24 hours of the
onset of symptoms will be successfully reduced by hydrostatic
reduction.
It is imperative to remember that hydrostatic reduction is
done on the threshold of the operation theatre and complete
readiness for an emergency laparotomy is essential. This may
be needed if the bowel ruptures during attempted reduction
leading to fecal peritonitis and delay can be fatal.
In cases where reduction fails or gets complicated or the
intussusception is already advanced, then the surgical options
available are:
• Laparoscopic reduction or laparoscopic-assisted bowel
resection and anastomosis
• Laparotomy with reduction or bowel resection.

RECTAL AND COLONIC POLYPS
Juvenile inflammatory polyps are the most common cause of
bleeding in children older than 2 years of age. Most polyps
are solitary juvenile polyps located in the rectum, hence are
palpable during a digital rectal examination by an experienced
pediatric surgeon. They present as painless, dropwise perrectal bleeding after defecation. They may be pedunculated
and can protrude from the anus. Occasionally, the connecting
stalk may get broken leading to incessant bleeding, so even a
per-rectal examination has to be done with great care.
If polyps are multiple, then a more sinister disease has to be
explained to the relatives. The final diagnosis will of course be
made after a histopathological confirmation of the type of polyp.
Juvenile polyps are the most common intestinal polyps
in children, accounting for almost 90% of colonic polyps in
children. Around 20–25% of patients with juvenile polyps
present with occult blood loss and anemia rather than visible
bleeding.
The majority of colonic polyps are sporadic and not
associated with malignancy, but familial adenomatous
polyposis and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome carry a risk of malignant
transformation. When there are more than five polyps in the
colon, multiple polyps throughout the GI tract or any number
of juvenile polyps with a family history of juvenile polyps, it is
known as juvenile polyposis syndrome, which carries a high
malignant potential.

Section 15: Pediatric Surgery
If the clinical history is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of
an intestinal polyp, but it is not felt on a per-rectal examination,
then a colonoscopy under GA is essential.

Treatment
•
•
•

Solitary rectal polyps are treated surgically by underrunning the base and excising the polyp under GA,
transrectally
Proximally situated polyps or multiple polyps will need a
pediatric colonoscopy with excision by electrocautery or
argon plasma coagulation
If multiple polyposis coli with adenomatous villous
polyps are detected, then a laparoscopic or open total
proctocolectomy with an endorectal ileoanal anastomosis
procedure will be required. In addition, the patient will
have to be kept on a strict follow-up colonoscopy regime to
look for early malignancies.

RECTAL PROLAPSE
Diagnosis of rectal prolapse is quite easy with a good history
taking and per-rectal digital examination. If there are hard
fecal masses present on per-rectal examination, then the
management shifts to management of chronic constipation as
outlined above. If the anal sphincter tone is good, then again
just softening of stools for a few months will cause the prolapse
to disappear.
If conservative treatment fails, then a surgical intervention
may need to be considered.
The various options available today are:
• Injection sclerotherapy for mild prolapse
• Laparoscopic mesh fixation of the rectum (may be done by
laparotomy, if facilities for laparoscopy are not available)
• Posterior sagittal rectopexy
• Excision of a persistent rectal prolapse (stage IV, procedentia).

Clinical Pearls
Counseling points for parents
• Per-rectal bleeding has a wide variety of causes and needs a
reliable history for the diagnosis
• It may need a battery of investigations to determine the
cause and in spite of that a small percentage of cases may be
idiopathic
• The commonest cause of per-rectal bleeding in India is caused
by an anal fissure due to a faulty diet
• Avoid long-term oral laxatives
• Intussusception very rarely needs surgery
• Estimated blood loss more than 10% of the blood volume
must be treated in the intensive care unit.

Inguinal Hernia
Satish K Aggarwal, Nitin Pant

INTRODUCTION
Inguinoscrotal swellings in children are a common reason
for pediatric consultation. Some of them may resolve
spontaneously (e.g., hydroceles) while others (e.g., hernia)
almost always require surgery. Obstructed hernia may require
emergency operation to prevent bowel strangulation. The aim
of this chapter is to enable a pediatrician to understand the
anatomy and pathology of processus vaginalis, its association
with testicular decent, and its role in manifestations of
hydrocele and hernia. The reader should be able to make a
correct diagnosis and counsel parents about need for surgery,
or watchful waiting in hydroceles, and make timely surgical
referral to avoid complications of obstruction and strangulation
in hernia. A brief description of available surgical techniques is
also given.
The testis descends into the scrotum during the seventh
month of gestation pushing a diverticulum of peritoneum
(processus vaginalis) ahead of it. This processus begins to
obliterate in a caudal-cranial fashion once the testis descends
to the scrotal base. The closure starts shortly before birth and
normally completed during the first year of life, leaving only
the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testis. The obliterated
processus vaginalis lies alongside the vas and vessels within
the spermatic cord. Failure of obliteration results in patent
processus vaginalis—the underlying abnormality in all hernias,
hydroceles, and encysted hydrocele of the cord.

INGUINAL HERNIA
Definition
By definition, a hernia is the protrusion of the contents of
a cavity along with its membrane through any normal or
abnormal opening. If the processus is wide enough, it allows
intestinal contents (bowel, omentum) to herniate through
it. This processus vaginalis forms the hernia sac which
can extend from the internal inguinal ring to the tunica
vaginalis (the inguinoscrotal hernia). More commonly, the

sac is incomplete, lying proximal to an obliterated segment
that intervenes between the sac and the tunica vaginalis
(bubonocele). This accounts for the vast majority of inguinal
hernia in children. If the processus is narrow allowing only
peritoneal fluid to pass through, a hydrocele results. If the
hydrocele extends up to the base of scrotum, it is called
a vaginal hydrocele. If the peritoneal fluid collects in a
loculus of the processus at some point along its course in the
spermatic cord, it is called encysted hydrocele. This loculus
usually communicates with the peritoneal cavity proximally,
but the distal part remains obliterated.

Types
Nearly all inguinal hernias in children are indirect, with
patent processus vaginalis being the underlying abnormality.
It travels from the deep inguinal ring across the inguinal
canal, comes out of the superficial ring and travels along the
spermatic cord to the scrotum. Incidence is 0.8–4.4% with
male to female ratio between 3–10:1. The incidence is higher
in infants—keeping with higher rates of patent processus
vaginalis in infancy. Preterm babies accordingly have highest
incidence varying from 16–25%. Right-sided hernias are more
common (60%), attributable to the late descent of the right
testis as compared to the left, hence a higher probability of
patent processus vaginalis on the right. In girls, the canal
of Nuck undergoes the same obliteration as the processus
vaginalis in boys. The obliteration is more likely to be
complete, hence a lower overall incidence of hernias, but
there is a higher incidence of bilateral hernias. The incidence
of bilateral hernia is higher if the first presentation is on the
left side.
Direct inguinal hernia results from a weakness in the
posterior wall of the inguinal canal. They are rare in children.

Clinical Presentation and Examination
The typical presentation of inguinal hernia in boys is a smooth
painless swelling in the groin, which bulges on crying or

SECTION 15: Pediatric Surgery

Fig. 1: Left-sided hernia in a boy. Note the left inguinoscrotal
swelling. The right testis has been pushed due to the large hernia

straining. The swelling may extend to the scrotum as seen
in figure 1. It disappears either spontaneously when the
child is quiet and relaxed, or by gentle manual pressure—a
maneuver to elicit “reducibility” of a hernia. Older children
often complain of groin or inguinal pain during exercise.
To elicit hernia in the clinic, a young child can be made to
strain or cry while older children can be asked to stand and
perform valsalva maneuver or blow a balloon. Clinically, one
can elicit the characteristic cough/strain impulse over the
swelling. The swelling extends in the inguinal canal deep to the
external oblique aponeurosis and emerges from the superficial
inguinal ring. Therefore, the upper margin is not well defined
(one cannot get above the swelling), hence it is called an
inguinoscrotal swelling. When the history is suggestive but the

typical hernia swelling is not elicitable during examination,
the index finger should be rolled transversely across the
spermatic cord over the pubic bone; if there is a hernial sac,
the “rustle” of contiguous layers of peritoneum represents the
empty hernial sac—referred to as a “silken sleeve” or “silk glove
sign”. Even if it is not present, it may be appropriate to assume
the diagnosis of hernia on the basis of intelligent history.
Another source of confusion arises when the parents mistake
a testis in the superficial inguinal pouch for a hernia. In these
cases, the site of the swelling should be precisely indicated
and the presence of a testis in the scrotum documented. If
doubt still exists, the parents can be advised to photograph
the swelling as it appears and examination can be repeated
later. The opposite side should always be examined, and both
testes confirmed to be in the scrotum. Certain conditions are
associated with an increased incidence of inguinal hernia
including prematurity, cryptorchidism, connective tissue
disorders, mucopolysaccharidoses, congenital hip dislocation,
cystic fibrosis, ascites, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, peritoneal
dialysis, abdominal wall defects, meningomyelocele, and
exstrophy bladder.

Management
Algorithm 1 shows a suggested approach to the management
of hernia and hydrocele.
An inguinal hernia will not resolve spontaneously, so
surgery is always indicated. Most full-term infants and older
children undergo an elective herniotomy soon after diagnosis.
It is a day care operation performed under general anesthesia
through a small skin crease incision in the groin. The hernia sac
is gently dissected from the cord structures (vas and vessels)
and transected and ligated at the deep inguinal ring. The distal
sac is left in situ but opened widely. The testis is confirmed
in the scrotum before closing. No repair of the inguinal floor
(herniorrhaphy) is needed unless special situations exist.

CHAPTER 130: Inguinal Hernia

Timing of Surgery
Infants
Elective surgery within days to few weeks from diagnosis.
It is not a dire emergency but waiting longer may invite
complications like obstruction—requiring emergency surgery
with possibility of bowel resection. Obstructed hernia is a
common complication during infancy.

Older children
Elective operation within few weeks.

Preterm babies
Low birth weight babies, who are admitted to neonatal units
with prematurity related issues, often develop a hernias. The
author’s practice is to operate on them once the medical
issues are over and the child is otherwise ready to be sent
home. However, there is an increased risk of anesthesia and
postoperative apnea risk. They may require postoperative
monitoring and ventilation for about 24 hours.

INCARCERATED HERNIA
An incarcerated hernia is one which does not reduce
spontaneously and is not reducible by gentle pressure. If left
untreated, it soon becomes obstructed, causing symptoms
of intestinal obstruction which may progress quite rapidly
to strangulation. Strangulation may cause intestinal and
testicular ischemia—the swelling becomes tense and tender
and there are features of intestinal obstruction. Strangulated
hernia requires emergency surgery to relieve intestinal
obstruction and save the gut and the testis. If the hernia is
incarcerated but not strangulated, the child may be mildly
irritable with groin pain but there is no abdominal distension
and no features of intestinal obstruction or hemodynamic
instability. Such a child should be admitted for monitoring
and sedated. Often the hernia will reduce spontaneously
within about 30 minutes of the child becoming quiet. If not,
“taxis” is applied—the surgeon stands on the side of hernia
and pushes the contents toward the inguinal canal across the
superficial ring with fingers of the right hand, simultaneously
aligning the sac to the superficial ring by the fingers of the left
hand on the top of the sac. Simply pushing the contents are
not successful because the sac turns on itself as it comes out
of the superficial ring. If taxis is successful, the hernia should
be repaired in 24–48 hours after the tissue edema subsides. If
taxis is unsuccessful, another attempt may be made about an
hour later (provided the patient is stable). If it still fails, urgent
operation should be carried out.
Risk of incarceration is highest in infancy reaching an
incidence of up to 30%. Therefore, surgery should be performed
soon after the diagnosis in this subset of patients so as to avoid
the risk of incarceration and strangulation.
An obstructed or strangulated hernia needs urgent
exploration after adequate resuscitation.

HYDROCELE
When the processus vaginalis is patent with a small lumen
it allows some peritoneal fluid to seep down along the cord
producing a soft, fluid-filled swelling (Fig. 2). This collection
of fluid between the layers of the tunica vaginalis is referred
to as hydrocele. Unilateral or bilateral congenital hydroceles
are common in the first few months of life. The swelling
usually is very mild in the morning when the child wakes up;
it gradually fills up during the day as the child remains active.
When sleeping, some fluid recedes back gradually making the
swelling smaller. But this swelling is not reducible manually
because of very small size of patent processus (ink well effect).
Table 1 shows how to differentiate between a hernia and
a hydrocele. The child is unaffected by the presence of the
swelling. Clinically, there is no impulse on crying or straining as
in hernia. The swelling is painless; it is situated around the testis,
is brightly translucent and cannot be emptied by pressure. The
underlying testis may be palpable when the hydrocele is lax,
and when it is tense, the testis shadow can be demonstrated
by transillumination. The upper limit of the hydrocele is
clearly defined—the palpating finger “can get above it”, except

in unusual varieties (abdominoscrotal hydroceles). Most
hydroceles resolve spontaneously as the processus obliterates
by the age of 1 year and surgery is only required if the hydrocele
persists beyond 2 years. Unusual situation that may warrant
an early surgery are: very tense hydrocele causing discomfort
to the child and possible compression of testicular vessels,
abdominoscrotal hydroceles, hydroceles associated with
ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, and when a hernia cannot
be excluded with certainty. An encysted hydrocele of the cord
is a loculus of fluid located above and separate from the tunica
vaginalis. Clinically, the swelling is separate from the testis
and one can get both above and below the swelling. As it is
in line with the processus, it moves when the testis is pulled
down. Uncommonly, an acute hydrocele develops secondary
to epididymo-orchitis, torsion, trauma or tumor—these
hydroceles resolve spontaneously. The operation for hydrocele
is the same as that for hernia.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Preterm Babies
They have high incidence of hernia but, owing to a wider neck,
the rate of incarceration is comparatively lower than in term
babies. When diagnosed in the neonatal unit they should be
repaired just before sending them home from medical point of
view. Bilateral operation is often necessary.

Hernia with Undescended Testis
Undescended testis is always accompanied by a hernial sac,
but is at low risk of incarceration. They can be safely repaired
at the time of orchidopexy (generally at 6 months). However,
the parents are warned about the danger signs of obstruction.
If symptomatic hernia develops, an early repair of hernia and
undescended testis is performed.

The author favors laparoscopic approach in all female hernias.
Routine use of karyotype to pick up a rare case of AIS is not
warranted. AIS requires removal of both testes and life-long
replacement of estrogens.

Bilateral Hernia
Twenty percent hernias are bilateral. Contralateral hernia may
also develop later after repair of ipsilateral hernia. It is more
common in infancy and girls, and when the presenting hernia
is on the left. Bilateral repair should be performed for clinically
present bilateral hernias. But, routine contralateral exploration
for a unilaterally presenting hernia is controversial. Some
surgeons follow the practice of bilateral exploration in selected
situations like preterm babies, presenting hernia on left side,
and infants and female hernia. With advent of laparoscopic
hernia repair, this issue is largely resolved as both the deep
rings are clearly visible and without any additional ports,
bilateral repair can be performed laparoscopically.

LAPAROSCOPIC VERSUS
OPEN REPAIR OF HERNIA
Open repair of hernia through a skin crease incision is a
standard time tested operation with universally good results.
However, laparoscopic repair has also made inroads during
the last decade with improved techniques largely resembling
open hernia repair. The advantages of laparoscopic repair are:
clear magnified view of vas and vessels (Fig. 3), therefore, less
chances of damaging them, no stretching of cord structures,
no disturbance to the testis, hence, less complication of
testicular fixation in the wound, and ability to do simultaneous
bilateral repair, if necessary. The disadvantages are: need to
go transperitoneally, more cost, and a higher incidence of
postoperative hydrocele. Most surgeons agree on its use for
female hernia. For males, the debate continues (Table 1).

Hernia with Ventriculoperitoneal Shunts
These hernias tend to be bilateral and have about 20% risk of
incarceration. Bilateral early repair is in order.

Hernia in a Female Child

640

The incidence of bilaterality is high in females. The ovary
may be a content and it is difficult to reduce. Often, there
is a fallopian tube also herniating out. If there is no pain or
tenderness in the ovary, an elective operation may be done
within a few days to weeks, but if there is pain or tenderness,
it may indicate torsion and requires urgent operation. Rarely,
androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) in a phenotypic female
may present with a hernia with a testis in the sac. The authors
advocate a preoperative ultrasound in females with hernia to
confirm presence of uterus and tubes. If a suspicious gonad is
found in the sac on the table, gonad is not removed; parents are
counseled, hernia repaired, and the child investigated further
with karyotype. Laparoscopy is a good tool to confirm internal
genital anatomy and repair hernia, which are often bilateral.

Antenatal Hydronephrosis
Anurag Krishna

Introduction
Routine antenatal ultrasonography has focused our attention
to urological abnormalities that occur in babies. Ultra­
sonologists routinely use terms such as pelvicaliectasis,
caliectasis, and hydronephrosis, leading to confusion in
the minds of the obstetrician, the neonatologist, and the
pediatric surgeon as to the precise significance of this finding.
This review aims to outline a logical approach to this problem
through the gestational period into the neonatal period
emphasizing what needs to be done and when, and more
importantly, what need not be done.

MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM
It is estimated that some degree of dilatation of the fetal renal
collecting system is identified in 1–5% of all pregnancies,
but in only one-fifth of these, dilatation is significant. The
term hydronephrosis simply denotes dilatation of the upper
urinary tract and does not necessarily imply the presence of
an obstruction or a significant functional abnormality of any
kind. In fact, only 3% of babies with a renal pelvis diameter less
than 10 mm had a significant abnormality needing surgery.
Antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) could occur because of:
• Functional dilatation: minor degree of dilatation that
usually spontaneously resolves or stabilizes later in
gestation or early infancy
• Obstruction: usually at the pelvi-ureteric junction, at the
ureterovesical junction, or in the urethra [as in posterior
urethral valves (PUV)]
• Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
• Renal dysplasia including multicystic dysplastic kidneys
• Uncommon conditions like duplex collecting system or
prune belly syndrome, etc.

What Is Significant Dilatation?
The Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) has recommended a grading
system for hydronephrosis (Table 1). An alternate method is to
measure the renal pelvis anteroposterior diameter.

ch-131.indd 642

A renal pelvis anteroposterior diameter of more than 10
mm after 24–26 weeks of gestation is generally accepted as
a reasonable criterion to denote significant dilatation. The
presence of caliectasis or calyceal dilatation is considered
an additional factor indicative of significant hydronephrosis.
More recently, there is evidence to suggest that milder degrees
of dilatation may also be significant in such babies, who may
have VUR rather than obstruction. Currently, a renal pelvis
diameter of at least 4 mm before 33 weeks and 7 mm after 33
weeks is considered significant. ANH can be classified as mild,
moderate, or severe for prognostic purposes (Table 2). A large
systematic review suggests that the risk of significant postnatal
pathology is 11.9% for mild, 45.1% for moderate, and 88.3% for
severe hydronephrosis.

Information from a
Good Antenatal Ultrasound Scan

Natural History of Antenatal Hydronephrosis

While assessing the significance of the antenatal renal
dilatation, particularly with a view to identify a possible cause
and whether it is worth continuing pregnancy, the ultrasound
must be done carefully and must give the following information:
• Estimated fetal size and weight, and its comparison with
normal for that gestational age
• Amniotic fluid volume (AFV)
• Whether dilatation is unilateral or bilateral, and whether
ureters are dilated or not
• Degree of dilatation (SFU grading) and dilatation of calyces
• Bladder fullness, thickness, and emptying
• Appearance of external genitalia
• Any other associated malformation.
The initial study is usually done at 16–20 weeks of gestation
using an appropriate transducer. There are no specific
guidelines on how frequently to image the fetus. It would be
reasonable to do the ultrasound every 4 weeks till 32 weeks and
two weekly thereafter, mainly to assess the AFV.

Current Status of Fetal Intervention
The rationale for fetal urinary decompression is that those
with severe obstruction early in gestation have significant
impairment of both renal and pulmonary development. It has
been recognized that if the AFV is adequate up to 27 weeks
of gestation, then severe pulmonary hypoplasia is unlikely to
occur. Percutaneous shunting of the bladder into the amniotic
space is technically feasible with some morbidity. However, its
role is extremely limited.
There is no place for any fetal intervention in unilateral
hydronephrosis. Even with bilateral pelviureteric junction
obstruction (PUJO), if the AFV is normal, percutaneous
drainage of the fetal kidneys or early delivery are not warranted.

Spontaneous resolution of prenatally detected hydro­nephrosis
occurs in 50–70% of all fetuses. This regression may be noted
on serial antenatal ultrasound scans or in the postnatal life
up to 3 years. Furthermore, in a substantial number, even if
the hydronephrosis does not resolve completely, the renal
function does not deteriorate despite persistence of pelvic
dilatation. On the other hand, 15–33% of patients show
progressive renal deterioration during observation. It has been
noted that increasing degrees of hydronephrosis correlated
with increased risk of urological pathologies that may need
surgical intervention.

POSTNATAL EVALUATION OF
ANTENATAL HYDRONEPHROSIS
Immediately after birth, the following must be recorded:
• Sex of the baby: in males, PUV is an important diagnosis to
be ruled out as it requires early surgical intervention
• Palpable kidney: common causes are PUJO (more
commonly unilateral), multicystic dysplastic kidney
(unilateral), and PUV (unilateral or bilateral)
• Palpable bladder: indicative of PUV in boys.
If the diagnosis of PUV is suspected, all further
investigations need to be done urgently as the baby requires
early surgical intervention. These babies need renal function
tests, ultrasound scan, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)
within a day or two after birth so that surgical ablation of the
valves may be done at the earliest.
In all other situations, there is no great haste to perform
investigations (Algortihm 1). The initial study to be done is the
ultrasound scan that must preferably not be done in the first
2–3 days. However, if the mother is being discharged earlier, it
is practical to send the baby with the ultrasound scan results.

Section 15: Pediatric Surgery
Following the ultrasound scan, a VCUG is done. There is
no doubt that the conventional VCUG is preferred to a direct
radionuclide cystogram (DRCG) because the latter does not
give a good delineation of the bladder and urethral anatomy
and that reflux, if present, cannot be accurately graded.
Controversy surrounds two aspects of VCUG:
• Should VCUG be done in all babies?
• When should it be done?
Should VCUG be done in all babies?
Voiding cystourethrogram is an invasive procedure, and
some studies have quoted a 6% rate of urinary tract infection
(UTI) following VCUG. This has made most clinicians reluctant
to ask for a VCUG in newborn babies. However, if properly
performed under antibiotic cover, the procedure is safe with
no risk of UTI (personal experience). There are some recent
reports that claim that routine VCUGs may not be indicated
in all babies with antenatally detected hydronephrosis. These
studies recommend VCUG for those babies with:
• bilateral hydronephrosis
• dilated ureters
• presence of UTI.
This literature against routine use of VCUG is far from
convincing. Most large centers recommend that this test
must be done in all babies with ANH even if the postnatal
ultrasound scan is normal. VUR has been recorded in 15–30%
babies born with an antenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis.
Tibballs reported that among 255 renal units with reflux, the
postnatal ultrasound was normal in 177 (70%). Furthermore,
some studies have shown that the postnatal ultrasound may be
normal even with the higher grades of VUR (12% of grade V and
31% with grade IV). The Indian Society of Pediatric Nephrology
has recommended a middle path for performing VCUG if
there is moderate-to-severe hydronephrosis, dilated ureters, or
bladder or urethral abnormalities.
When should it be done?
Some authors recommend that a VCUG should be done
at 4–6 weeks postnatal age. Though, again, it would be more
practical to do it before the baby leaves hospital. Either way, till
the VCUG has been done and VUR excluded the baby needs to
be on low dose antibiotics using amoxicillin (15 mg/kg/day) or
cephalexin (50 mg/kg/day). Trimethoprim (2 mg/kg/day) may
be used safely in babies after 4–6 weeks of age. Neonates who do
not have VUR do not need further antibiotic chemoprophylaxis.

Role of Radionuclide Imaging Studies

644

In most babies, the ultrasound scan is repeated at 4–6 weeks of
age. In most situations, a diuretic renogram is done at about 4
weeks of age to evaluate renal functional status and presence
of obstruction. Renograms performed immediately after birth
may be difficult to interpret due to the immature function of
the kidneys and their handling of the radioisotope. Diuretic
renogram is indicated in all kidneys with grade 3 or 4, and
occasionally grade 2 hydronephrosis; there is bilateral PUJO or
ureterovesical junction obstruction; if there is a solitary kidney;
or, the kidney is palpable and tense.
The renal scan is superior to the introvenous pyelogram
for many reasons. It is safer (contrast reactions and radiation
are less), there is better visualization of the collecting system,

ch-131.indd 644

and objective and quantitative assessment of relative
function of each kidney is possible. The ideal radionuclide
is mercaptoacetyltriglycine, but a cheaper, though less
accurate option is the diethylenetriamine pentaacetate
acid (not dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan. In lower grades
of hydronephrosis, if VUR has been excluded, no further
workup with renal scans may be necessary. These babies need
observation with 3-monthly ultrasound to ensure that the
degree of hydronephrosis is static and not worsening.

Follow-up Evaluation
Currently, no single test can reliably predict whether a
hydronephrotic kidney will improve or deteriorate. Most people
agree that nearly all infants with unilateral PUJO are initially
managed conservatively if the diuretic renogram shows at least
35–40% differential renal function. Exception are infants with
renal infection, tense renal lump or pelvis anteroposterior
diameter more than 50 mm. Follow-up ultrasound scan and
diuretic renography is repeated at 3–6 months and if there
is a deterioration in differential renal function, pyeloplasty
is indicated. Nearly 20% infants will show deterioration on
follow-up requiring pyeloplasty. This usually happens in the
first year of life.
Children with lesser degree of hydronephrosis (up to pelvis
anteroposterior diameter of <20 mm) need to be followed up
with a ultrasound scan at 3 months, 1 year, then 2, 5, and 10 years.
Radionuclide study is done at 3 months, 1 year, and if required
at 2, 5, and 10 years. If the renal function or degree of dilatation
improves, there is no further need for the isotope study.

Clinical Pearls
• Hydronephrosis >7 mm after 33 weeks is significant
• Look for bladder emptying in fetuses with hydronephrosis,
particularly bilateral
• First postnatal ultrasound may be done 48–72 hours after birth
• In male babies, always exclude possibility of posterior urethral
valves by looking for bladder emptying
• Till a voiding cystourethrogram is done, it may be safer to give
low dose antibiotic prophylaxis
• Diethylenetriamine pentaacetate acid renogram should be
done if obstruction is suspected. Dimercaptosuccinic acid
renal scan is to be done in cases with vesicoureteral reflux.

Key points

Antenatal hydronephrosis does not necessarily mean
obstruction

Fetal intervention is not required in majority of cases
))
Postnatal evaluation must be done in all such babies and
must include a surgical opinion

Management of
Vesicoureteric Reflux
Minu Bajpai, Aparajita Mitra, Manisha Jana, Rakesh Kumar, Chandra S Bal

Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is seen in 1% of the
general population. It is seen in 37% of children and up to 50%
of neonates who present with urinary tract infection (UTI).
The association of the triad of UTI-VUR-nephropathy forms
the basis of treatment of VUR. However, lack of application of
appropriate tools in the studies has led to inconsistencies in
management protocols. In VUR, some urine flows back into
the ureters during the act of micturation depending upon the
grade of reflux. VUR may resolve spontaneously with increasing
age, albeit slowly. At the end of 5 years, grades I and II reflux
persist in 37% of children and at 10 years in 25%. During the
corresponding periods, grades III–V reflux persist in 48 and
23%, respectively. Negative prognostic factors for resolution
are recurrent UTIs and bladder dysfunction. Bilateral reflux
resolved more slowly than unilateral reflux and it resolved more
rapidly in boys than in girls. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been
widely employed in the hope of prevention of pyelonephritis.
However, pyelonephritis occurs despite antibiotics.

•

MAINSTAY OF MODERN MANAGEMENT
OF VESICOURETERIC REFLUX
•
•

•

Continuing VUR has the potential to cause long-term
renal damage, therefore, early diagnosis and prevention of
pyelonephritis are very important
UTI may occur even in nondilating VUR (grades I and
II). In a follow-up study in children with VUR, who
were evaluated using criteria specified in the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, 17.2% of children
with normal ultrasound had renal injury identified on renal
scanning, and 62.1% had grade III or higher VUR
The Subcommittee on UTI of the AAP acknowledges that
it is important to detect urinary tract anomalies, such as
VUR, at the outset, once UTI is confirmed. Children with
VUR are believed to be at risk for ongoing renal damage
with subsequent infections, resulting in hypertension and
renal failure. Therefore, identifying urinary abnormalities

•
•

•

•

[by ultrasonography and micturating cystourethrogram
(MCU)] may offer the benefit of preventing hypertension
and renal failure
It has been recognized that, the diagnosis of UTI in young
children is often delayed as the clinical presentation is
often with vague general symptoms
Any antenatally diagnosed and postnatally confirmed
dilated ureter or hydronephrosis or diagnosis of conditions
like duplication anomalies or pelvic kidneys have a risk of
ipsilateral VUR, whereas, multicystic dysplastic kidney and
renal agenesis has an increased incidence of contralateral
VUR. Therefore, MCU/voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)
should be carried out after confirmed, UTI even in presence
of mild hydronephrosis. Once VUR is confirmed, a full
workup is carried out, which includes dimercaptosuccinic
acid (DMSA) scans and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
estimation
Long-term antibiotic use may increase the severity of otitis
media in children. In some studies, including the National
Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines,
prophylactic antibiotics have been found neither to be
effective in reducing the risk of recurrent pyelonephritis
nor incidence of renal scarring in children less than 30
months of age who have grade II–IV VUR
It should be recognized that infants often have non-specific
symptoms of UTI which may remain unnoticed
Renin angiotensin system has been shown to be activated
even in the presence of sterile reflux. The upper tracts are,
therefore, at risk in presence of VUR even between the
episodes of UTI
Endoscopic treatment is viewed as preferable to open
surgery by 60% of parents even for grades I–II reflux and
80% of those with grade III reflux over long-term antibiotic
prophylaxis (Figs 1A and B)
Presently, the endoscopic treatment of VUR by
dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (DXHA) is increasingly
viewed as first line therapy for reflux (Figs 2A and B)

•

Parental preference for choice of therapy is honored and
they should be offered information on the three options of
therapy:

Option A (Antibiotic Prophylaxis)
Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) does not require any
procedure, as compared to the other two options. However, it
does not cure reflux and only reduces the incidence of UTI.
Pyelonephritis may continue to occur. It also requires longterm treatment, with a low success rate after 1 year (33%
in grades II–IV reflux) is a major disadvantage. It has been
recognized that after 2 years of age, chances of spontaneous
resolution of VUR are low, while prolonged antibiotic use leads
to side effects. CAP is still being recommended until more
definitive studies suggest otherwise.

Option B (Endoscopic Injection)
Endoscopic injection recreates the antireflux mechanism by
injecting an inert material into the bladder wall at the ureteric
orifice. While general anesthesia is required, it is generally a
day care procedure. Its success rates range from 70 to 83%.
Success for even grades IV and V reflux reaches above 90% after
two or more injections.

Option C (Open Surgery)
The aim of open surgery is to prevent reflux by reimplantation
of ureter and restoring the antireflux mechanism. Success rates
for open surgery are 98%, with few complications. However,
the higher success rates for open surgery necessitate greater
expense and the need for in-patient hospitalization.

SECTION 15: Pediatric Surgery
•

•

•
•

•

Grade V VUR should be offered open/laparoscopic
surgery. Depending upon the availability and afforda­bility,
endoscopic injection may be offered as an option while
explaining the need for two or more injections. When
treated by surgery, ureteric reimplantation should be
performed after 18 months of age. Till this age, CAP should
be given. If recurrent infections continue to occur before
this period, either endoscopic injection or surgery may be
offered even earlier by creating a pop-off mechanism
Grades III and IV VUR as well as associated cortical
abnormalities delay reflux resolution. Considerations
should be given to treat these by intention to cure, such as
endoscopic injection (option 2) or open surgery (option 3)
If CAP is used, reassessment of VUR by cystogram
between 12 and 24 months after the prior cystogram is
recommended to determine when therapy can be stopped
Open or endoscopic surgery shall be offered in the
presence of UTI, new scars in DMSA scanning, and
parental preference. If decision to intervene is postponed
even after frequent UTIs, there is a higher risk of continuing
postoperative UTIs
After open surgery, ultrasonography should be performed
to rule out obstruction. Follow-up monitoring should
be carried out for infections, new scarring, and somatic
growth through adolescence.

MANAGEMENT OF
VESICOURETERIC REFLUX
Following considerations should be given while outlining
choice of therapy:
• Reflux diagnosed in infancy resolves in about 50% within
24 months
• According to NICE guidelines, as well as other studies,
prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in reducing
the risk of recurrent pyelonephritis or renal scarring in
children less than 30 months of age who have grade II–IV
VUR. However, antibiotics seem to be better than placebo
in preventing infection if given for short periods, but, have
side effects with prolonged use
• Infants often have nonspecific symptoms of UTI which
may remain unnoticed. They also have a greater risk of
morbidity related to infection
• Continuing VUR has the potential to cause long-term
renal damage; therefore, early diagnosis and prevention of
pyelonephritis are very important
• Renal injury/scars are mediated through the activation of
renin angiotensin system:
{{ Microalbuminuria indicates that renal tubular injury
has already begun as this is an early marker of inception
of renal damage

ALGORITHM 1

VUR, vesicoureteric reflux; UTI, urinary tract infections; DMSA, dimercaptosuccinic acid; PRA, plasma renin activity.
*If recurrent UTIs develop during the waiting period, then some other temporizing surgery, such as lower ureteric pop-off mechanism, should be offered to the patient.

CHAPTER 132: Management of Vesicoureteric Reflux
Raised plasma renin activity (PRA) indicates that
activation of renin angiotensin system has already
begun
Renin angiotensin system has been shown to be activated
even in the presence of sterile reflux. Therefore, the upper
tracts are at risk in presence of VUR even between the
episodes of UTI
It has been recognized that after 2 years of age, chances of
spontaneous resolution of VUR are low
Ureteric reimplantation should be avoided before 18
months of age.

Additional Information
•

•

Management of Vesicoureteric Reflux in
the Child under 2 Years of Age
Children under 2 years of age should be assessed for renal
abnormalities and bladder bowel dysfunction. When present,
treatment for the latter is initiated.
• Children with grades I, II, and III VUR who do not have either
UTI, cortical scarring, raised PRA, or microalbuminuria
form a special group: they should be offered option 1 (CAP)
for a period of 12 months or till the time any of the above
features develop, whichever is earlier. In the absence of
UTIs, MCU should be done between 12 and 24 months. If
there is persistence of reflux or any of the above features
develop, they should be offered option 2 or 3, as follows
• Children with any grade of reflux who have either UTI,
cortical defects/scarring, raised PRA, or micro­albuminuria:
they should be offered option 2 (endoscopic treatment).
In the event of nonavailability or, nonaffordability due to
cost of injection, option 3 should be offered. In the case of
decision on the latter case (option 3), antibiotics should
be continued till 18 months of age (“waiting period”
during which open surgery by ureteric reimplantation
is best avoided). During this “waiting period” if adverse
circumstances appear, such as recurrent UTI, cortical
defects, rise in PRA or microalbuminuria, surgical options
other than ureteric reimplantation may be considered.
These are temporizing procedures such as creating a popoff mechanism.

Clinical Pearls
• Antibiotics seem to be better than placebo in preventing
infection if given for short periods, but have side effects with
prolonged use
• Infants often have nonspecific symptoms of urinary tract
infection (UTI) which may remain unnoticed. They also have a
greater risk of morbidity related to infection
• Continuing vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) has the potential to
cause long-term renal damage. Therefore, early diagnosis and
prevention of pyelonephritis are very important
• Renin angiotensin system has been shown to be activated even
in the presence of sterile reflux. Therefore, the upper tracts are at
risk in presence of VUR even between the episodes of UTI
• It has been recognized that after 2 years of age, chances of
spontaneous resolution of VUR are low
• Ureteric reimplantation should be avoided before 18 months
of age.

CONCLUSION
•

Management of Vesicoureteric Reflux in the
Child Over 2 Years of Age
Children over 2 years of age should be assessed for renal
abnormalities and bladder bowel dysfunction. When present,
treatment for the latter is initiated.
• Children with grades I, II and III VUR over 24 months of
age and who do not have either UTI, cortical scarring,
raised PRA, or microalbuminuria form a special group:
they should be offered option 1 for a period of 12 months
or till the time any of the above features develop, whichever
is earlier. If there is persistence of reflux or any of the above
features develop, they should be offered option 2 or 3
• Children with any grade of reflux who have either UTI,
cortical defects/scarring, raised PRA, or micro­albuminuria:
they should be offered option 2 (endoscopic treatment). In
the event of nonavailability or, nonaffordability due to cost
of injection, option 3 should be offered.

Endoscopic treatment can be offered concomitant with
management of bladder and bowel dysfunction. It has been
found to be safe and effective in resolving VUR in children
with associated lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction, even
before their LUT condition has fully resolved. However,
bladder bowel dysfunction should definitely be under
control before surgical intervention
Reflux in solitary kidney and bilateral reflux:
{{ Any grade of reflux with either UTI, cortical defects/
scarring, raised PRA, or microalbuminuria should be
offered endoscopic injection/surgery
{{ Grades I and II reflux without UTI, cortical defects/
scarring, raised PRA, or microalbuminuria: antibiotics
for a period of 12 months. If there is persistence of
reflux or any of the above features develop they should
be offered option 2 or 3.

•

•

While managing VUR, it is important to take into account
individual risk factors in each child. These are: age, sex,
grade of reflux, bilaterality, bladder dysfunction, and bowel
function
It has been recognized that, while antibiotics have some
role for short periods of time, endoscopic injection and
surgery are offered with intention to “cure” to stop reflux
and are more effective in long-term renal outcomes
Parental preference should be honored and details of the
three options of management of VUR should be explained
to them.

Intussusception
Gautam S Agarwal, Anurag Krishna

INTRODUCTION
Intussusception is an acquired invagination of the bowel into
itself, usually involving both small and large bowel (Figs 1
and 2). Ileocolic intussusception is the most common cause
of small bowel obstruction in children. Intussusception is
an emergent condition where delay in diagnosis is not rare,
and may result in bowel obstruction, venous congestion,
subsequent bowel necrosis, and perforation.

DIAGNOSIS
Radiographs typically are ordered by the clinician to exclude
other diagnoses (Fig. 3). Even in experienced hands, abdominal
radiographs have poor sensitivity (45%) for the detection of
intussusception but may serve to screen for other diagnoses
in the differential diagnosis, such as constipation, and for free
peritoneal air.

INCIDENCE AND CLINCAL FEATURES
The peak age for idiopathic intussusception is 5–10 months
and typically ranges up to 3 years. The most common clinical
presentation is of an infant with crampy abdominal pain
and irritability, vomiting, and bloody stools, although signs
and symptoms vary considerably and overlap with other
abdominal conditions. The clinical features of intussusception
are given in table 1.

The presence of a curvilinear mass within the course of the
colon (the crescent sign), particularly in the transverse colon
just beyond the hepatic flexure, is a nearly pathognomonic sign
of intussusception.
The absence of bowel gas in the ascending colon is one
of the most specific signs of intussusception on radiographs.
However, small-bowel gas located in the right abdomen on
radiographs may mimic ascending colon or cecal gas.
Sonography increasingly is used to diagnose either
intussusception or alternative causes for a child’s abdominal
symptoms.
Sonography also plays a role in the evaluation of reducibility
of intussusception, the presence of a lead point mass, the
potential incomplete reduction after enema (vs. edema of the
ileocecal valve), and of intussusception limited to small bowel.
At this point in time, there are no reliable clinical
prediction models that accurately can identify all patients with
intussusception. The clinical triad of colicky abdominal pain,
palpable abdominal mass, and current jelly stools is present in
less than 50% of cases.
There is no doubt that a computed tomography scan
of the abdomen may diagnose intussusception. However,
the cost, radiation dose, and risk of sedation in these young
children make it far less practical than sonography. Published
sonography studies from single institutions suggest high

accuracy, approaching 100% in experienced hands, with a
sensitivity of 98–100% and specificity of 88–100% (Fig. 4).

CHAPTER 133: Intussusception
–– Fluoroscopy
■■ Pros: Confidence
■■ Cons: Radiation.
Barium is no longer the liquid contrast medium of choice for
reduction of intussusception due to risk of barium peritonitis,
infection, and adhesions if perforation occurs during the
enema. While iodinated contrast is considered a safer agent
than barium, one should be aware that it may produce fluid
and electrolyte shifts if perforation occurs because contrast is
absorbed from the peritoneum.
An intussusception encountered in the rectum has only
a 25% reduction rate, but intussusceptions encountered
elsewhere in the colon, including the hepatic flexure, can be
expected to have a successful reduction rate of approximately
80%. The most common location to encounter idiopathic
intussusception is at the hepatic flexure.
Before enema reduction, dehydration should be treated
with intravenous fluid resuscitation. If the child is clinically
unstable, he or she should not undergo enema. Children with
evidence of peritonitis, shock, sepsis, or free air on abdominal
radiographs are not candidates for enema. These children
should be stabilized and treated surgically.
The presence of small-bowel obstruction reduces the
probability of successful enema reduction but it is not a
contraindication to performing the enema.
The most important factor that decreases the reduction rate
of enema is the duration of symptoms. The longer the duration
of symptoms beyond 24 hours, the lower the likelihood of
successful contrast enema reduction. Most literature suggests
a significant delay is typically 48 hours of symptoms but some
reports suggest 24 or 72 hours.
Age less than 3 months is associated with both a higher
perforation rate and a lower rate of successful reduction, as
is dehydration and small-bowel obstruction. These situations
are less common. The lethargy, as seen in this child, is not rare
when they become dehydrated. It is important to correct the
child’s dehydration to improve the enema intussusception
reduction rate.
The most important potential complication of enema is
bowel perforation. The most common site is at or just proximal
to the intussusception in the transverse colon. Perforations
with air tend to be smaller than those with liquid enema
although the overall perforation rates are similar.
The air enema is considered superior at reduction,
cleaner (based on appearance of peritoneal cavity at surgery
when perforation occurs), safer, and faster with less radiation
when compared with liquid enema. In a summary of the
literature, there were 32 studies using air reduction and 39
using liquid (barium, iodinated contrast, saline, or water)
reduction techniques. Air enema studies had significantly
higher mean reduction rates compared with liquid enema
studies (82% vs. 68%).
The air enema technique is well described in the literature.
Briefly, the enema tip should be placed within the child’s
rectum and taped in place with abundant tape. The child is
placed in a prone position to allow the radiologist or assistant
to squeeze the buttocks closed and prevent air from leaking.

Air is rapidly insufflated into the colon under fluoroscopic
observation.
Once the intussusception is encountered, its reduction is
followed fluoroscopically until it is completely reduced. Air
should flow freely from the cecum into the distal small bowel
loops to signify complete reduction. One critical safety issue is
to keep air pressure below a maximum limit of 120 mmHg to
avoid the risk of perforation.
There is no direct evidence supporting the commonly
taught “rule of threes” regarding the liquid enema technique,
particularly the appropriate height of the enema bag.
The superior air enema reduction rate may be due to the
presence of higher intraluminal pressure for air compared with
standard hydrostatic reduction.
In case of failure of reduction and above mentioned absolute
indications, sometimes an operative reduction is required. At
laparotomy, the mass is delivered and gentle manual reduction
is done. The key to reduction is slow, constant milking and
squeezing in a retrograde manner.The intussusceptum is
pushed rather than pulled. Infrequently when the maneuver
fails, or if the bowel is gangrenous, resection of the intestine
with end-to-end anastomosis may be required.

RECURRENCE
Fifty percent of children who develop recurrent intus­susception
will present within 48 hours, although recurrences have been
reported up to 18 months later. If the clinical concern is for
recurrent intussusception, there is little added information
gained by abdominal radiography. Radiographs may show
alternative diagnoses or obstruction but if the clinical concern
is for recurrent intussusception, sonography is the most
reliable test.
There is no question that sonography to screen for
intussusception is a valid imaging test. However, in this
situation, the pretest probability is high for the diagnosis of
intussusception and, therefore, enema would be the reasonable
next step. Repeat enema is both safe and effective in recurrent
intussusception, as long as the child remains clinically stable.
If the patient is not clinically stable, or has signs of peritonitis,
then the patient should undergo surgical reduction.
Intussusception recurrence rates average 10% in large
series, with a range of 5.4–15.4%, regardless of air versus liquid
enema technique. The recurrence rates are less than or equal
to 5% when surgical reduction is performed, presumably due
to the development of adhesions.
The risk of a pathologic lead point (Fig. 5) in children
with recurrent intussusception is low. No predictive clinical
factors have been identified for pathologic lead point in these
children with recurrent intussusception. No clear risk factors
are known for why some children have recurrences although
some do have a focal pathologic lead point. Those with diffuse
bowel abnormalities (diffuse pathologic lead points) and
ileocolic intussusception, such as children with cystic fibrosis,
Henoch-Schönlein purpura, or celiac disease, may be treated
with enema reduction more aggressively than those with focal
pathologic lead points to avoid surgery. Repeat enema is both

child remains clinically stable.
Some articles have reported associations between
intussusception and viral infection, particularly adenovirus,
although the lack of seasonality suggests more than one
pathogen. Approximately 5–6% of intussusceptions in children
are caused by pathologic lead points that are due to either
focal masses or diffuse bowel wall abnormality. The most
common focal pathologic lead points are (in decreasing order
of incidence) Meckel’s diverticulum, duplication cyst, polyp,
and lymphoma.

Neonatal Jaundice:
Surgical Perspective
Nidhi Sugandhi, Veereshwar Bhatnagar

INTRODUCTION
Jaundice in a neonate can have varied connotations. Its
spectrum ranges from physiological jaundice on one hand to
obstructive jaundice requiring urgent surgical correction on
the other hand.
Structural anomalies in the biliary tract causing direct
hyperbilirubinemia due to obstruction to bile outflow are
amenable to surgical correction. Box 1 lists the structural
anomalies presenting with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
These anomalies may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic; of these,
extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) is the most common. While
extrahepatic obstructions have high likelihood to be surgically
correctable, others with diffuse intrahepatic structural
anomalies, such as Caroli’s disease and Alagille syndrome may
be cured only with radical surgery like segmental hepatectomy
or liver transplantation.
Though they constitute only 0.2–0.4% of total cases of
neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, the urgency to diagnose and
treat the surgical causes of neonatal jaundice stems from two
facts: (i) most of the surgical causes of neonatal jaundice are
correctable if operated upon early and (ii) if left untreated they
progress rapidly to cause irreversible liver damage, cirrhosis,
portal hypertension, liver failure, and eventually death. Thus it
is important to diagnose the group of jaundiced neonates likely
to have surgically correctable causes of jaundice and initiate
appropriate treatment.
Box 1: Causes of neonatal surgical jaundice
• Extrahepatic biliary atresia

Confusion with the physiological jaundice normally present
in the early neonatal period can lead to delay in identification
of neonates requiring further investigations and treatment.
Specific parameters indicate pathological jaundice. These are
enumerated in table 1.
A noteworthy point is that even minimal rise of direct
or conjugated bilirubin is pathological and needs to
be investigated. Thus the most important initial test is
measurement of the serum conjugated bilirubin concentration
to establish the presence of cholestasis.
Cholestatic jaundice or direct hyperbilirubinemia is the
hallmark of surgically correctable biliary tract anomalies.
However, it is also a component of mixed hyperbilirubinemia
in another group of disorders with intrahepatic cholestasis
including idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH). Box 2 lists the
causes of direct hyperbilirubinemia including the structural
anomalies and causes of neonatal cholestasis. Thus, once
cholestatic liver disease has been established, the next
challenge is to differentiate the structural anomalies from
INH which can be treated medically in most cases. The clinical
features and investigations needed to differentiate between
the two groups of disorders are discussed in subsequent
sections.

CLINICAL FEATURES

656

Surgical jaundice is not evident immediately after birth
and appears after 5–7 days. Usually, it merges with the
physiological jaundice and is suspected due to unusual
prolongation of the physiological jaundice. Sometimes, it
may also appear 2–3 weeks after birth, subsequent to clearing
of the physiological jaundice. Typically, the first stools of
the neonate are normal and cholic. Differentiating features
need to be looked for. Characteristically, history of clay
colored stools and dark colored urine indicates direct hyper­
bilirubinemia. It should be noted that intermittent passage
of cholic stools, though more frequent in intrahepatic
cholestasis, does not rule out extrahepatic obstruction.
Children are initially active with normal growth during
the first few weeks. Neonatal choledochal cyst can closely
resemble EHBA clinically with a fulminant course including
pancreatitis and cholangitis in contrast to intermittent
symptoms as seen in older children. The classic triad of pain,
mass, and jaundice is typically not seen.
Infants whose cholestasis is caused by bacterial sepsis,
hypopituitarism, or metabolic disorders such as galactosemia
may be acutely ill. Infants who have metabolic liver disease
may have poor feeding, inadequate weight gain, hypoglycemia,
and hypotonia. Hepatitis due to TORCH (Toxoplasmosis,
Other Agents, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, HErpes simplex, and
Syphilis) agents may be associated with dysmorphic facies,
microcephaly, and low birth weight, prematurity, and other
congenital anomalies.

ch-134.indd 656

Physical examination reveals firm to hard hepatomegaly. Late
stages may reveal cirrhotic liver and splenomegaly indicating
development of portal hypertension. Signs of liver failure appear
later and include ascites, spider nevi and coagulopathy.
However, no details in the history or physical examination
are capable of differentiating all infants with neonatal hepatitis
from those who have biliary atresia. Many infants who have
intrahepatic cholestasis (10–15%) have cholestasis so severe
that they mimic biliary obstruction.

EVALUATION OF
THE CHOLESTATIC NEONATE
Pathological jaundice with conjugated bilirubin fraction
above 20% establishes the diagnosis of cholestasis. Further
investigations are aimed at differentiating between neonatal
hepatitis and extrahepatic obstruction and assessing the
severity of liver derangement.

Initial Investigations
Conventional serologic liver function tests are often non­­
specific but discrimination between extrahepatic ductal
disease and neonatal hepatitis is sometimes possible.
Hyperbilirubinemia secondary to neonatal hepatitis is
characterized by elevation of both the direct and indirect
component whereas rise in indirect bilirubin in extrahepatic
obstruction is a late event after the onset of liver failure.
Similarly, synthetic function of the liver as assessed by
coagulation profile and serum proteins is impaired only in
later stages in extrahepatic obstruction. Gamma-glutamyl
transferase may be elevated in both the conditions but is
usually higher in extrahepatic obstruction. Box 3 enumerates
the basic serologic tests for patients suspected with jaundice
due to a surgical cause.

Specific Investigations
A battery of tests is required to establish the presence and
cause of extrahepatic obstruction. Despite these the definitive

diagnosis may be established only on the operating table with
the help of intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC).

Ultrasonography
A quick, noninvasive, and cheap initial investigation, an
ultrasonography is very useful to indicate extrahepatic
obstructive lesions. It can definitively diagnose or rule out
choledochal cyst which is visible as a cystic subhepatic mass.
Gall bladder stone and biliary sludge are also easily visible.
Certain features, viz., absence of gall bladder or a gall bladder
less than 1.5 cm in size with no contractility in response
to feeding, triangular cord sign due to hyperechoic portal
plate, and fibrous cord remnant raise suspicion of EHBA. In
particular, the triangular cord sign has 100% specificity but
only 73% sensitivity to diagnose EHBA. Preduodenal portal
vein, asplenia, or polysplenia are further supportive of a
diagnosis of EHBA. Dilated proximal biliary radicles rule out
EHBA and favor inspissated bile duct syndrome. However, this
is an operator dependent investigation and can, therefore, only
guide further investigations rather than definitively diagnose
all extrahepatic obstructions.

bladder and intrahepatic ducts

Tc99m-hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid Scintigraphy
Failure to excrete this technetium labeled isotope into
the duodenum even after 24 hours is diagnostic of EHBA.
Infants who have biliary atresia do not excrete isotope into
the gut, making the test 100% sensitive for this disorder.
Unfortunately, specificity is not satisfactory as severe neonatal
hepatitis cases may also not excrete the isotope. Pretreatment
with phenobarbitone (5 mg/kg/day) for 3–5 days preceding
imaging enhances excretion and increases discrimination
between EHBA and neonatal hepatitis, and therefore, should
always be followed.

Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is
being increasingly used to evaluate extrahepatic obstruction
and in one small series has shown 100% diagnostic accuracy in
the evaluation of biliary atresia (Figs 1 and 2). However, further
evaluation is required in larger series before establishing its
role in diagnostic evaluation. The usefulness is also limited due
to high cost and difficulty in performing this investigation in
neonates.

Liver Biopsy
Liver biopsy was earlier considered a definitive investigation
for differentiating neonatal hepatitis and biliary obstruction.
However, characteristics thought to suggest EHBA (including
bile ductular proliferation, bile plugs in small bile ducts,
portal tract fibrosis and edema, swelling, vacuolization,
sloughing of biliary epithelium, inflammatory cell infiltration,
and giant cell transformation) may also be present in
advanced stages of severe neonatal hepatitis. Moreover it
is an invasive investigation and may require some time for
analysis. In approximately one-third of the specimens, the
histological findings are not clear-cut, so further evaluation
becomes necessary. A combination of open biopsy (with a

ch-134.indd 657

Fig. 2: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showing a
cystic dilatation of the common bile duct suggestive of choledochal cyst

guaranteed adequacy of size of specimen) and operative
cholangiography is recommended as the ideal approach to
the obstructed child.

Intraoperative Cholangiogram
The gold standard for the diagnosis of EHBA with highest
sensitivity and specificity and widely employed as an
effective practical tool is operative cholangiography. The
liver and extrahepatic biliary atresia ducts are inspected by
a minilaparotomy incision and, if present, gall bladder is
cannulated and injected with radiopaque dye (Fig. 3). Failure
of the dye to reach the duodenum and/or nonopacification
of the proximal biliary ducts, confirm the diagnosis of EHBA
(Fig. 4). Additionally, flushing of bile ducts may prove to be
therapeutic in cases of inspissated bile ducts and some cases of
neonatal hepatitis with secondary bile duct obstruction. Liver
biopsy can be taken at the same time. Details of intrahepatic
ductal anatomy are also clearly seen with an IOC (Fig. 5).

Additional Tests
Additional serological tests may be done simultaneously with
above investigations to negate the possibility of neonatal
hepatitis. It is important to perform the above mentioned
investigations like ultrasound and cholangiography
simultaneously along with the following serological tests
rather than wait for the results of serological tests as timing of
intervention in cases of extrahepatic obstruction is of utmost
importance in determining the long-term prognosis. The
serological tests for neonatal hepatitis are listed in box 4.

Direct hyperbilirubinemia with non-excretion of radio­
nuclide in Tc99m-hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA)
scans even after 24 hours mandate a minilaparotomy with
cholangiography and liver biopsy. It cannot be emphasized
enough that the surgery should never be delayed to wait for
results of the serological tests. The timing of the surgery to
restore the bile flow is crucial. Best immediate and long-term
results are obtained when surgery is performed at less than 60
days of age. Delay leads to proportionally more liver damage
and poorer outcome. Studies have demonstrated 10-year
survival rate of patients undergoing surgery before 60 days
to be 68–80% compared to 15% survival in those undergoing
surgery after 90 days.
The infant should be stabilized preoperatively with special
attention to correction of any coagulopathy and antibiotics to
prevent or treat cholangitis.
Infants with preoperative diagnosis of choledochal cyst
undergo a straightforward excision of cyst with Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy. For others, findings on IOC determine
the further procedure.
Nonexcretion or minimal excretion of dye with proximal
dilatation of biliary radicles indicate inspissated bile syndrome
which responds to thorough flushing of the ducts. Clearing of
the ducts may be confirmed by repeating the IOC at the end of
the procedure.
Absence of gall bladder with atretic common bile duct,
nonexcretion of dye with no proximal visible biliary radicles
along with a firm or hard, cirrhotic enlarged liver confirms

the diagnosis of EHBA and the surgeon proceeds with Kasai
portoenterostomy (KPE). This entails resecting the fibrous
tissue at the area of porta hepatis, with subsequent apposition
of a Roux-en-Y loop of intestine to act as a conduit for biliary
drainage. The resection at the area of the porta hepatis is
believed to expose small but patent bile ducts that can directly
drain into the jejunal loop and restore the bile flow.

COMPLICATIONS
Cholangitis is the most common and serious complication
with an incidence of 33–60%. It is more common in the first

ch-134.indd 659

few years after surgery and contributes to progressive liver
dysfunction and cirrhosis, thus being responsible for delayed
failure of KPE. The incidence can be reduced with a longer
Roux loop (>50–70 cm), construction of an intussuscepted
valve at the jejunojejunostomy site, postoperative prophy­lactic
antibiotics [recommended trimethoprim (4 mg/kg/day)—
sulfamethoxazole (20 mg/kg/day or neomycin 25 mg/kg/day)]
and use of oral steroids [prednisone (2 mg/kg/day)] for at least
3 months postsurgery.
Poor weight gain and malnutrition with poor absorption
of fat soluble vitamins may persist even after surgery. Portal
hypertension may progressively worsen due to initial liver

Section 15: Pediatric Surgery
damage and can cause life threatening variceal bleeding and
hypersplenism.

POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
Prophylactic antibiotics and steroids are continued for 3
months after surgery to prevent cholangitis. Steroids are known
to have additional anti-inflammatory and immuno­suppressive
effects, thus decreasing edema, collagen deposition, and
scarring. They are also thought to have choleretic effect by
stimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase.
Ursodeoxycholic acid is administered for its choleretic
effect and is specially indicated after flushing in inspissated bile
syndrome. Additionally, Vitamin A, D, E, and K supplements
are recommended to prevent malnutrition. Box 5 surmises
post-KPE treatment.

OUTCOME
If the Kasai operation succeeds in restoring bile flow, the
evolution of biliary cirrhosis is prevented or at least delayed;
10-year survival rate for patients who have their native livers
is approximately 30% in reports from multiple centers.
As a general observation, out of all the infants diagnosed
with EHBA undergoing KPE, in one-third bile flow is never
restored despite anatomically patent hepaticojejunostomy,
possibly due to irreversibly fibrosed biliary ductules at the
porta hepatis. Two-thirds achieve bile flow after KPE; half
of these (30–35% of total) will have sustained bile flow and
remain free of long-term sequelae. However, in the other
half of those achieving initial bile drainage (35% of total),
progressive liver insufficiency insidiously develops with
return of jaundice, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. Thus,
despite initial palliation, these children eventually require liver
transplantation. Factors influencing prognosis are the patient’s
age at the time of surgery, extension of liver fibrosis at surgery,
degree of intrahepatic bile duct injury, number of episodes of
ascending cholangitis, the surgeon’s expertise, and the site of
bile duct obstruction.

LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Extrahepatic biliary atresia accounts for nearly half of all
pediatric liver transplants. It is considered for patients in whom
there is delayed presentation with established liver failure,
bile outflow cannot be established even after KPE, or there is
progressive decrease in biliary outflow and worsening of the
liver damage with uncontrollable sequelae. Primary transplant

• Ursodeoxycholic acid: 10–15 mg/kg/day
• Trimethoprim (4 mg/kg/day): sulfamethoxazole (20 mg/kg/day)
or neomycin (25 mg/kg/day)
• Vitamin A, D, E, and K drops
• Prednisone (2 mg/kg/day)

instead of KPE has been suggested as an alternative but not
recommended. Apart from shortage of donor organs, KPE
restores bile flow in at least one-third of the patients and delays
the onset of end stage liver disease in another third. Thus liver
transplantation is an important but only a salvage procedure in
the management of EHBA.

CONCLUSION
Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a neonate presents a
surgical challenge and indicates intrahepatic or extrahepatic
bile flow obstruction. EHBA, choledochal cysts, biliary
sludge/gall stones, and inspissated bile are the common
causes of surgically correctable neonatal jaundice, of which
EHBA is the most common. USG, HIDA, and IOC should be
undertaken early in the workup of direct hyperbilirubinemia
to differentiate surgically correctable lesions from neonatal
hepatitis. Surgical correction should be done by the age of
2 months for best outcomes. The pediatrician has an important
role in identification and early referral of infants with surgically
correctable causes of neonatal jaundice.

Atopic Dermatitis
Vibhu Mendiratta, Nikita, Sarita Sanke

INTRODUCTION
Atopic eczema is a chronic relapsing pruritic, non-contagious
endogenous eczema. It begins in infancy and continues up to
adulthood. It occurs in individuals who have atopic tendency.
These individuals may develop any or all of the three closely
linked conditions: atopic eczema, asthma, or allergic rhinitis.
The hallmark of the disease is pruritic dermatitis that localizes
in different areas depending on age. It is a familial and chronic
disease and its symptoms can increase or disappear over time.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Atopic dermatitis (AD) most often begins in childhood before
age 5 and may persist into adulthood. For some, it flares
periodically and then subsides for a time, even up to several
years. Atopic dermatitis can affect almost 20% of children.
It affects between 1 and 3% of adults. It is estimated that
75% of the cases of AD improve by the time children reach
adolescence, whereas 25% continue to have difficulties with the
condition through adulthood. The prevalence of AD is however
quite difficult to establish since the diagnostic criteria are not
applied universally and are not standard, but it is thought to
vary roughly between 10 and 30%.

ETIOLOGY
Four main factors interact closely in the etiology and
pathogenesis of this condition:
• Genetic predisposition
• Impaired immunity
• Epidermal barrier dysfunction
• Environmental factors.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT (Algorithm 1)
Atopic dermatitis looks different in infants, children, and adults.

ch-135.indd 661

In infants, an erythematous oozy rash may develop by 2 or
3 months of age. It develops suddenly, predominantly affecting
the scalp and face, especially on the cheeks. The extensors of
the limbs like elbows, knees, and ankles are more commonly
involved. It is intensely itchy and interferes with the sleep of
the child. The skin of the child in general is dry and xerotic.
The diaper area being constantly moist is never involved in
AD. Atopic dermatitis has to be differentiated from seborrheic
dermatitis (SD) where in there are greasy scales over scalp
(cradle cap), and face mostly over eyebrows, nasolabial folds,
retroauricular grooves and neck. Diaper area is classically
involved unlike in AD. The rash in SD is nonpruritic, and the
infants are totally undisturbed by it. Hair loss is rare in SD, but
common in AD probably due to itching and rubbing.

Clinical Pearls
• Pruritic exudative plaques over face and scalp: suspect atopic
dermatitis
• Diaper area is never involved in atopic dermatitis.

Psoriasis in infants is not uncommon and is often
mistaken with AD. It often affects the scalp, folds and diaper
area. Lesions over trunk (if present) are well demarcated
erythematous plaques surmounted by a thin white scale.
Atopic dermatitis in children beyond 2 years of age
involves the flexures like the cubital fossa, popliteal fossa, neck,
groins, wrists, and ankles. The involved skin is erythematous
and oozy, at places lichenification develops due to constant
itching. Scabietic eczema should be ruled out where in lesions
of varied morphology like papules, pustules and nodules along
with burrows can be seen especially over hands and feet with
relative sparing of face. History of nocturnal itching can be
elicited in family members.
Flexural erythematous rash along with dry xerotic skin
elsewhere is seen in Netherton syndrome, which makes
it essential to differentiate it from AD. Here, examination

of the hair will reveal trichorrhexis invaginata, with raised
immunoglobulin E.
Zinc and biotin deficiency can present as an eczematous
eruption or an erythroderma, and are often misdiagnosed as
AD before other symptoms and signs become evident. The skin
eruption consists of dermatitis on the face that has a typical
horseshoe appearance on the cheeks and around the chin, with
perianal involvement. However, there is no xerosis or pruritus.
In older children the lesions are seen on the elbows and knees,
whereas in AD the flexures are usually involved.
Other dermatitis like nummular dermatitis, allergic or
irritant dermatitis can resemble AD and should be ruled out.
It is rare for adults to get AD. About half (50%) of people
who get AD during childhood continue to have milder signs
and symptoms of AD as an adult. When an adult has AD, it often
looks different from the AD of childhood. They may continue
to have a diffuse pattern of eczema but the skin is often more
dry and lichenified than in children. Commonly, adults have

ch-135.indd 662

persistent localized eczema, possibly confined to the hands,
eyelids, flexures, nipples, or all of these areas. The skin is prone
to secondary bacterial infections.

Clinical Pearl
• Always look for hyperlinerity of palms, Dennie morgan fold and
other features of atopy when suspecting atopic dermatitis.

Individuals with AD may show other associated features
of atopy like generalized xerosis, Dennie morgan fold,
hyperlinearity of palms, pityriasis alba, keratosis pilaris,
allergic shiners, and ichthyosis vulgaris.

MANAGEMENT
Treatment of atopic eczema may be required for many months
and possibly years. It nearly always requires:

•
•

Reduction of exposure to trigger factors (where possible)
Antihistamines: both first and second generation can be
used to control pruritus. Regular application of emollients,
multiple times per day is very important
• Topical steroids (current mainstay of treatment; commonly
used in conjunction with moisturizers): Hydrocortisone,
triamcinolone, or betamethasone; ointment bases are
generally preferred, particularly in dry environments
• Immunomodulators: tacrolimus and pimecrolimus
(calcineurin inhibitors) are considered second-line therapy.
Other treatments options available include the following:
• Systemic therapy: systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate,
azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil
• Phototherapy: ultraviolet A for acute exacerbations,
narrowband ultraviolet B for chronic disease
• Biological: omalizumab
• Others: probiotics, antibiotics for clinical infections.

Clinical Pearl
What to tell parents?

•
•
•
•

Keep child in humid environment
Avoid pets, dust
Use lukewarm water for bathing
Apply adequate emollients immediately after bath.

Key points

Approach to a Child with
Hypopigmented Macules
Vibhu Mendiratta, Pravesh Yadav

Introduction
Hypopigmented macules in a child can be a cause of worry
for the parents and physician alike. Hypopigmented macules
may be present since birth or may appear later in childhood.
This chapter briefly outlines the approach to such presentation
(Algorithm 1).
Various genetic, autoimmune, and infective diseases
may manifest as hypopigmented lesions in children.
Hypopigmented macules may present at birth or later in
childhood. Localized hypopigmented lesions with forelocks
may present at birth in patients with piebaldism or Waardenburg
syndrome. Piebaldism presents as depigmented patches on
the ventral or lateral trunk and/or the mid-extremities with the
sparing of hand and feet. Poliosis is a common feature. It is not
associated with systemic features. Waardenburg syndrome is
associated with dystopia canthorum, broadening of the nasal
root, presence of hypoplastic alae nasi, synophrys, poliosis,
heterochromia iridis, congenital sensorineural hearing loss,
musculoskeletal abnormalities like limb contractures and
hypoplasia of the limb musculature, and Hirschsprung disease.
Nevus depigmentosus presents as ill-defined hypo­
pigmented macules with feathery margins. Similar cutaneous
lesions along lines of blaschko with or without extracutaneous
manifestations occur in hypomelanosis of Ito. Localized
hypopigmented lesions without forelock may occur in vitiligo.
Nevus anemicus presents as pale, ill defined hypopigmented
macules, which merges with surrounding skin on diascopy.
Tuberous sclerosis may present as off white macules, which
are oval at one end and taper to the other end, resembling
ash leaf called as ash-leaf macules. They are often present
at birth or appear within the first few years of life commonly
over trunk and buttocks. Wood’s lamp may be used to improve
detection especially in light pigmented individuals. Three
or more hypopigmented macules constitute a major feature
for the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. A less common type
of hypopigmentation is the “confetti” skin lesions involving
the legs or forearms which are considered a minor feature for
tuberous sclerosis.

ch-136.indd 664

Generalized hypopigmentation with hair and eye
involvement occurs in albinism. It results either from
enzymatic defects in the biosynthesis of melanin, from
melanosomal defects that interfere with melanin formation,
or from problems in the intracellular transport and
localization of proteins essential for melanin biosynthesis.
In oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 1A, or the classic
tyrosinase negative OCA, there is a complete inability to
synthesize melanin in skin, hair, and eyes, which results in
the characteristic “albino phenotype”. Affected individuals
are born with white hair and skin. The phenotype OCA type
1B can range from minimal hair pigment to near normal skin
and hair pigment. They have very little or no pigment at birth
and develop varying amounts of melanin in the hair and skin
in the first or second decade of life.
Localized well defined, slightly, scaly, hypopigmented
macules involving the trunk, chest, back, and shoulders
occurs in pityriasis versicolor. It is caused by Malassezia
species, which on potassium hydroxide microscopy show
hyphae and blastospores in the typical “spaghetti and
meatballs” appearance. A yellow-green fluorescence is visible
using Wood’s lamp examination. Pityriasis alba typically
presents as ill defined localized powdery white scaly lesions
involving the head and neck region, which may progress to
non-scaly hypopigmented macules. It is commonly seen in
atopic individuals. Leprosy presents as well to ill defined
hypopigmented macules with loss of sweating, hair loss, and
loss of sensation. Lesions in tuberculoid pole presents as
single to a few xerotic hypopigmented macules with hair loss.
Lesions in lepromatous pole present as multiple ill defined,
infiltrated hypopigmented macules and hair loss may occur
later on. Diagnosis of leprosy may be confirmed by slit skin
smear or histopathological examination. Inflammatory
lesions may lead to post-inflammatory hypopigmentation
which presents as well to ill defined hypopigmented
macules. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus presents as a pruritic
erythematous patch in the early stage, evolving into a well
defined porcelain hypopigmented plaques with epidermal

atrophy and follicular atrophy. Vitiligo is a common disorder of
depigmentation occurring in approximately 1% of the world’s
population. Various hypotheses have been proposed including
autoimmune, neurogenic, etc. Vitiligo may be associated
with diabetes mellitus, thyroid diseases, etc. Histopathology
shows absence of melanocytes and melanin in epidermis.
Hypomelanotic macules present in a localized form or
generalized form. Various morphological forms have been
described like acrofacial, segmental, etc. Hairs over the lesion
may also turn gray. Spontaneous repigmentation may occur
in some lesions. Exposure to chemicals may lead to ill defined
hypopigmented macules of chemical leukoderma.
Diffuse acquired hypopigmentation may occur in patients
with hypothyroidism and hypopituitarism.

Clinical Pearls
• Localized hypopigmented lesions with forelocks may present
at birth in patients with piebaldism (without systemic features)
or Waardenburg syndrome (with systemic features)
• Generalized congenital hypopigmentation with hair and eye
involvement occurs in albinisim
• Vitiligo may present in a localized form or generalized form at
birth or later in life.

Pediatric Acne
Vibhu Mendiratta, Niti Gaur, Aashim Singh

INTRODUCTION
Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory condition of the
pilosebaceous unit with a peak incidence during adolescence.
However, it may be found in all age groups including neonates
and infants (Algorithm 1).

NEONATAL ACNE
The onset of neonatal acne is usually before the first 6 weeks of
life. It affects about 20% of the newborns. The papules typically
occur across nasal bridge and cheeks. There are no comedones.
This benign condition is hormonally mediated. Neonatal acne
may be hard to distinguish from heterogeneous papulopustular
acneiform conditions typically without comedones, such as
neonatal cephalic pustulosis or transient neonatal pustular
melanosis. Neonatal cephalic pustulosis pustules are usually
confined to the cheeks, chin, eyelids, and forehead, but the
scalp, neck, upper chest, and back may be involved. It has been
attributed to overgrowth of Malassezia species. Newborns may
present with or develop transient neonatal pustular melanosis,
with pustules on the chin, neck or trunk. Within 24 hours, these
pustules rupture, leaving hyperpigmented macules with a rim
of faint white scale. Most cases of neonatal acne resolve by 3
months of age but severe cases can be treated topically with 2%
ketoconazole cream, benzoyl peroxide or erythromycin.

INFANTILE ACNE
Infantile acne may begin approximately at 6 weeks of age and
last for 6–12 months. It is more common in boys and presents
with comedones as well as inflammatory lesions, which can
include papules, pustules, or occasionally nodular lesions.
Physical examination should include assessment of growth
including height, weight, and growth curve; testicular growth
and breast development; presence of hirsutism or pubic hair;
clitoromegaly; and increased muscle mass. The etiology is

ch-137.indd 667

postulated to be transient rise in dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate and luteinizing hormone levels. Most infantile acne
is self-limited and not associated with underlying endocrine
pathology. There is some evidence that infantile acne
predisposes to more severe adolescent acne. Infantile acne
may be treated with topical antimicrobial agents; topical
retinoids; non-cycline antibiotics, such as erythromycin; and,
occasionally, isotretinoin.

Clinical Pearl
• Acne not responding to treatment or with unusual presentation
should be further evaluated to look for underlying endocrine
pathology.

MID-CHILDHOOD ACNE
Mid-childhood acne presents primarily on the face with a
mixture of comedones and inflammatory lesions. Children
between the ages of 1 and 7 years, however, do not normally
produce significant levels of adrenal or gonadal androgens;
hence, acne in this age group is rare. When it does occur, an
endocrine abnormality should be suspected. In addition to
treatments to address androgen-secreting tumors or congenital
adrenal hyperplasia, the treatment of mid-childhood acne is
similar to that of adolescent acne except that oral tetracyclines
are usually not an option in children younger than 8 years of
age because of the risk of damage to developing bones and
tooth enamel. Hormonal therapy could be used if warranted
by endocrinologic pathology.

Clinical Pearl
• Tetracyclines are contraindicated in children <8 years and
oral isotretinoin is not recommended in children <12 years
according to the food and Drug Administration.

Approach to pediatric acne depending on age of onset

PREADOLESCENT ACNE
Preadolescent (7–12 years) acne is common and may precede
other signs of pubertal maturation. It is characterized by a
predominance of comedones on the forehead and central
face (the so-called “T-zone”) with relatively few inflammatory
lesions. Further workup is generally unnecessary unless there
are signs of excess androgens. Treatment of uncomplicated
preadolescent acne is comparable to that of acne in older age
groups, as discussed later.

ADOLESCENT ACNE

668

Adolescent acne (12–19 years) is common and characterized
by comedones and inflammatory lesions over face, back,
arms. Acne can be categorized as predominately comedonal,
inflammatory and/or mixed. Presence or absence of scarring,
post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or erythema should
be assessed. Severity may be broadly categorized as mild,
moderate or severe. The pathogenesis of acne involves the
interplay of four factors: sebaceous hyperplasia under the
influence of increased androgen levels, alterations in follicular
growth and differentiation, colonization of the follicle by

ch-137.indd 668

Propionibacterium acnes, and consequent immune response
and inflammation.

TREATMENT OF MILD ACNE
Topical therapy alone or in combination is recommended
as initial treatment of mild acne. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as
a single agent, topical retinoids, or combinations of topical
retinoids, antibiotics and BPO as individual agents or fixeddose combinations may be used. If the response is inadequate
then a topical retinoid or BPO may be added to monotherapy
with either agent.

TREATMENT OF MODERATE ACNE
Moderate acne may be initially treated with topical
combinations including a retinoid and BPO and/or antibiotics,
or with oral antibiotics in addition to a topical retinoid and
BP and/or topical antibiotics. Optimally, the topical regimen
would include a retinoid and a benzyl peroxide-containing
formulation, either separately or as a combination product. In
addition, use of an oral antibiotic may be especially prudent if
there is evidence of acne scarring, even if the current severity

11/22/2016 11:14:05 AM

Chapter 137: Pediatric Acne
of inflammatory acne is more modest. Typically, 4–8 weeks of
compliant oral antibiotic use are needed before the clinical
effects of an oral antibiotic are visible, whereas maximal
response may require 3–6 months of administration.

TREATMENT OF SEVERE ACNE
Patients with severe acne are at significant risk for scarring.
Severe acne should be treated with oral antibiotics and topical
retinoids with BPO, with or without topical antibiotics, with
consideration of hormonal therapy in pubertal females or oral
isotretinoin. Patients unresponsive to these topical and oral
therapies will benefit with oral isotretinoin.

Clinical Pearl
• Childhood acne may persist and raises the risk of development
of severe scarring acne in adulthood.

Approach to Congenital
Melanocytic Nevus
Vibhu Mendiratta, Pravesh Yadav

INTRODUCTION
Congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) represent a develop­
mental abnormality of normal melanocytic development.
This is probably due to mutation that occurs in a progenitor
cell that results in the abnormal extensive accumulation of
melanocytic cells along migration pathways during normal
development. The events leading to the nevomelanocyte
accumulation may also have effects on the surrounding tissue
probably due to a change in the local cytokine environment of
the nevomelanocytic cells. According to American National
Institutes of Health consensus definition, CMN have been
categorized according to size into small, under 1.5 cm in
diameter, large as having a diameter between 1.5 and 20 cm and
giant nevi as having a diameter of 20 cm or more (Algorithm 1).
Congenital melanocytic nevi are usually obvious and deeply
pigmented at birth. Majority of these nevi are macular at birth
with smooth, regular and sharply demarcated contour and
distortion of the skin markings. As the child grows, the nevus
usually grows in proportion. At some sites, such as the scalp,
there is commonly a considerable increase in terminal hair. In
other sites, an increase in terminal hair tends to occur more
subtly over time and may be accompanied by the development
of rugosity. As the infant grows, the surface of the nevus may
become rugose or warty and nodules can develop within a
large nevus. Congenital melanocytic nevi may develop a halo of
depigmentation, heralding a potential spontaneous resolution.
Loss of pigmentation has been associated with regression of
underlying melanocytes. Dermatoscopy can sometime prove
to be helpful in the diagnosis showing a characteristic reticular
or globular pattern. A significant proportion of nevi may
become paler in the first 1–2 years of life, and at sites such as
the scalp may fade to cosmetic insignificance.
There may be associated abnormalities such as meningeal
involvement, spina bifida, or meningocele when the nevus
is located over the vertebral column, or club-foot and
hypertrophy or atrophy of the deeper structures of a limb.
Absence of subcutaneous fat is the most common associated

ch-138.indd 670

anomaly and may be symptomatic in sites such as over the
sacrum. Neurocutaneous melanosis may rarely produce raised
intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus or space-occupying
spinal lesions. A variety of proliferative neoplasms may
develop in CMN. Superficial spreading melanoma is the
most significant complication of CMN but the level of risk is
reasonably low. In giant nevi, there is a definite risk, with the
age of onset of the melanoma being earlier than in the general
population. A magnetic resonance imaging scan should be
considered in babies with nevi over the cranium or spine to
exclude significant leptomeningeal melanocytosis. Regular
neurological examination, however, is clearly important.
Histopathology shows presence of nevomelanocytes in the
epidermis as well ordered theques and/or nevomelanocytes
in the dermis in the form of sheets, nests, cords and/or single
cells. Presence of nevomelanocytes in the lower two-thirds of
the reticular dermis and association with appendageal and
neurovascular structures is more commonly seen with CMN
than acquired nevi. Nevomelanocytes may be prominent
within and around the blood vessels showing an inflammatory
appearance. Hair follicles are often quite large and associated
with abundant melanin in the hair bulb.
Differentials of CMN include CALM (café au lait macules),
nevus spilus, Becker’s nevus, lentigo simplex, nevus sebaceous,
smooth muscle hamartoma, epidermal nevi, dermal melano­
cytosis, and solitary mastocytoma.
Congenital melanocytic nevi are essentially considered to
be developmental abnormalities of the skin, with a very low risk
of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies, which is particularly
important when reassuring parents who have a child with a
giant melanocytic nevus. The aims of treatment are to improve
the cosmetic effect of nevi and to reduce the risk of malignant
transformation. The most common treatment is surgical,
using a variety of plastic surgical techniques such as multistep
surgery, the use of tissue expanders and grafting. Tissue
expansion is usually used for the head and neck, but in other
sites excision and grafting are more usual, with consequently
poorer cosmetic results. Other ablative techniques have been

11/22/2016 11:15:23 AM

Chapter 138: Approach to Congenital Melanocytic Nevus
tried such as cryotherapy and, more recently, the Q-switched
ruby laser.
Parents of children with CMN left in situ should be advised
to keep the nevus under review and to seek advice if it changes
in shape, size, or color. Photographs of the child’s nevus and
images of melanomas may be useful tools. Even small nevi that
are difficult to keep under review, such as those in the scalp
or in the middle of the back may be prophylactically excised,
particularly if they have any atypical features such as intense or
irregular pigmentation which persists beyond infancy.

Seborrheic Dermatitis
Vibhu Mendiratta, Nikita, Sarita Sanke

INTRODUCTION
Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic papulosquamous
inflammatory disorder affecting the sebaceous gland rich areas
of the skin. It is a benign self-limiting condition characterized
by remissions and exacerbations. It occurs due to seborrhea,
a pathologic overproduction of sebum, with subsequent
infection and inflammation. It typically presents with scaly,
flaky, greasy, and red skin. The severity ranges from mild
dandruff to exfoliative erythroderma. It can occur in any age
group; however, two age peaks are noted; in infants—during
first 3 months of life and in adults—during 4th to 7th decade
of life. These age peaks correlate with the high activity of
sebaceous glands.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Seborrheic dermatitis affects healthy individuals of any ethnicity,
with no sex predilection. Estimates of SD prevalence and
incidence are hindered by many cases being mild and poor case
definition, so probably underestimate the true figure. Estimates
are also limited due to absence of validated criteria for diagnosis.
As per literature, SD affects 3–5% of the general population. Up
to 70% of newborns are affected by SD in their first 3 months
of life. Dandruff, the mildest form of SD effects 15–20% of the
population. SD is especially prevalent in those with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome and chronic neurodegenerative disorders.

ETIOLOGY
The exact etiology remains uncertain. It involves a complex
interaction between:
• Host factors
• Malassezia species
• Environmental factors.
Host factors: overactivity of sebaceous glands leads to
excess production of sebum. Seborrhoeic dermatitis may

ch-139.indd 672

be aggravated by illness, psychological stress, fatigue, sleep
deprivation, and reduced general health.
In children, excessive vitamin A intake can cause
seborrhoeic dermatitis. Lack of biotin, pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
and riboflavin (vitamin B2) may also be a cause.
Those with immunodeficiency (especially infection with
HIV) and with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s
disease and stroke are particularly prone to it.
Malassezia species: the most implicated species are Malassezia
globosa, others being Malassezia furfur and Malassezia restricta.
Infantile SD is more commonly associated with Malassezia
furfur. Patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis appear to have a
reduced resistance to the yeast. Malassezia hydrolyze human
sebum releasing a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty
acids (FAs). They take up the required saturated FAs, leaving
behind unsaturated FAs. The unsaturated FAs penetrate the
stratum corneum and because of their non-uniform structure
breach the skin’s barrier function. This barrier breach induces
an irritation response, leading to seborrhea and dermatitis.
Environmental factors: worsening of SD occurs in winters and
early spring. Remission can be seen in summers.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND
APPROACH (Algorithm 1)
Infants
Cradle cap is the most common presentation in infants and
usually appears in the first few weeks of life. There are greasy,
yellow scales and crusts that may eventually coalesce to a thick,
scaly plaque with underlying mild to moderate erythema.
Overall, scalp is the most commonly affected site, followed by
face. Areas of face commonly affected are forehead, eyebrows,
nasolabial folds and retroauricular areas.Seborrheic dermatitis
can also involve the thorax, upper back, external genitalia and
flexures such as the axillae, inguinal folds. Involvement of
perianal area in the form of diaper rash is also common.

Chapter 139: Seborrheic Dermatitis
Algorithm  1
Seborrheic dermatitis and its differentials: Diagnostic approach

Clinical Pearl
Seborrheic areas
• Scalp, retroauricular areas, medial eyebrows, nasolabial fold,
anterior chest, interscapular area, axillae, groins, and diaper area.

The condition is not itchy unlike in adolescents. The
condition usually resolves without treatment in weeks to
months, although treatment may be used if needed.
On the other hand, patient with atopic dermatitis have
scalp and facial involvement in the form of oozy plaques
which are extremely pruritic. Extensors may also be involved.
Diaper area is characteristically spared unlike infantile SD and
psoriasis. If the infant exhibits systemic and constitutional

ch-139.indd 673

features along with seborrhic dermatitis like lesions, he should
be worked up for Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis. Scabies with
eczematisaton is also a close mimicker of the disease where
presence of nocturnal exacerbation itching and lesions in
contacts help differentiate the conditions.

Adolescents
Seborrhea of scalp in the form of dandruff is the most common
presentation in adolescents and adults. Greasy white to yellow,
fine scales with underlying erythema can be seen. This should
be differentiated from well-defined plaques with micacious
scales seen in scalp psoriasis. The sites of predilection are the
same as in infants. However, in adolescents SD is usually worse
in hair bearing areas of the face and involvement of flexures

673

11/22/2016 11:17:24 AM

Section 16: Dermatology
and perianal area is less common. Centrofacial erythema is
prominent with greasy scales over eyebrows, nasolabial folds
and retroauricular region. Absence of flushing, telangiectasias
help us differentiate it from rosacea where papulopustules are
present on baseline facial erythema over convexities. Trunk
may also be involved with perifollicular papules (petaloid
pattern) and papulosquamous lesions (pityriasiform pattern)
with greasy scales. Truncal lesions resemble pityriasis rosea
and pityriasis versicolor. Candidal intertrigo and tinea cruris
can mimic flexural SD which can be diagnosed with simple
bedside testing with potassium hydroxide mount.

TREATMENT
The symptoms of SD can be effectively controlled with a
combination of self-care measures and drug therapy.
Topical antifungal agents and topical corticosteroids
are the principal forms of management for SD. Of these two
treatment modalities, antifungals are the mainstay. However,
during acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are often
used as first line therapy.

Infant Seborrheic Dermatitis
Cradle cap usually resolves without treatment. However, it
may require treatment in some cases. Regular emollients and
mild non-medicated baby shampoos can be tried initially for
infantile SD, especially if asymptomatic. For more widespread,
symptomatic or persistent SD, topical ketoconazole 2%
cream, mild corticosteroid ointments (hydrocortisone
1%, desowen lotion 0.05%, clobetasone butyrate 0.05%) or
combination preparations containing hydrocortisone and
miconazole can also be used—initially twice daily on affected
areas, weaning down on improvement. The scales should be
gently removed with a soft brush after shampooing. A small
amount of emollient can be applied to the scalp overnight to
loosen the scaly plaques. There is no role of oral antifungals
in infantile SD.

Clinical Pearl
• Infantile seborrheic dermatitis is a physiological condition and
usually does not require treatment.

Adolescent/Adult Seborrheic Dermatitis
Seborrheic dermatitis in adults is a chronic condition. Longterm maintenance treatment is often necessary.

Scalp Seborrheic Dermatitis

674

Dandruff (mild SD of the scalp) can be treated with antidandruff shampoos. Several types of anti-dandruff shampoos
are available, with the main difference between them being the
active ingredient. All of these treatments are equally effective
after 4 weeks of use. The main active ingredients are:
• Selenium sulfide
• Tar
• Zinc pyrithione
• Ketoconazole.
Shampoos containing corticosteroids, propylene glycol
and keratolytics like coal tar and salicylic acid can also be used

ch-139.indd 674

for additional benefits. For best results, the shampoo should
be left in place for 5–10 minutes before rinsing. The shampoo
should be rinsed out of the hair completely.
The shampoo may be used every day initially, and then
every other day as symptoms improve. These shampoos can be
used for as long as needed.

Nonscalp Seborrheic Dermatitis
Seborrheic dermatitis of the face, trunk, and skin folds generally
is treated with topical corticosteroids or antifungal agents.
Low potency topical corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone
1% cream) may be tried initially. The cream is applied once
or twice a day until symptoms improve with gradual tapering.
Topical antifungal agents (ketoconazole 2%, miconazole)
either alone or in combination with topical steroids can also
be used. Long-term application of steroids should be avoided
in view of side effects like atrophy, striae and telangiectasias.
The topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecro­­
limus are effective in treating SD. Both can be used twice daily
initially and weaned down as the SD improves. Proactive
treatment of adult facial SD to maintain remission with 0.1%
tacrolimus ointment once or twice per week is also effective.
For refractory or widespread SD where topical therapy is
impractical, oral itraconazole 200 mg daily for 2–4 weeks is
effective.

Clinical Pearls
Cradle cap: What to tell parents
• Regular scalp wash with mild baby shampoo
• Remove scales with a brush
• Emollients can be used to loosen the scales.

Approach to Red Eye in Children
Suma Ganesh, Priyanka Arora

INTRODUCTION
Red eye is one of the most common reasons for acute eyerelated visits to the pediatricians, while some causes are
uncomplicated and resolve within a few days, many cases
require prompt treatment to prevent the disease from
worsening or spreading. The condition can be managed
by pediatricians, but knowing when to refer the patient
to ophthalmologist is crucial. In this chapter, we will be
discussing the common causes of red eye in children and the
approach to management of these causes.

CAUSES OF RED EYE
Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. It may
be infectious (bacterial or viral) or noninfectious (allergic,
chemical). At a leading cornea service (Will’s Eye Hospital),
blepharoconjunctivitis was the most common diagnosis in
children, accounting for 15% of all pediatric referrals. Most
cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting. Other
common causes of red eye in children include blepharitis,
corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage,
keratitis, iritis, chemical burns, trauma, endophthalmitis, and
severe dry eye. Some uncommon causes of red eye in children
are iridocyclitis, episcleritis, contact lens related, due to
chemical irritants like chlorine in swimming pools, head
lice if they spread to ocular area, and congenital glaucoma
(Table 1).

HISTORY AND EXAMINATION
A thorough patient history and eye examination may provide
clues towards etiology of red eye (Table 2). Salient points in this
history includes whether the condition is unilateral or bilateral,
duration and type of symptoms, presence of discharge and its
nature, visual changes, pain, photophobia, itching, and any
previous treatments.

Tips for an Effective Patient History and
Examination
When a child presents with red eye, one must be able to identify
potentially serious ocular conditions that require immediate
referral. Includes these questions in a through histroy to aid in
differential diagnosis:
• When did the symptoms start?
• Are they in one eye or both?
• Is there any discharge in the eye? If yes, what kind and how
much?
• Is there any swelling or pain in eyes?
• Is there a history of similar complaints in any of the family
member?
• Any recent history of:
{{ Explosure to chemicals
{{ Contact with another person with red eye
{{ Injury to the eye

Red eye in a newborn can be an alarming sign to the
pediatricians as well as parents
The common causes could be:
{{ Ophthalmia neonatorum (neonatal conjunctivitis)
{{ Birth trauma: corneal injury during forceps delivery

{{ Nasolacrimal duct obstruction/dacryocystitis

Ophthalmia Neonatorum
(Neonatal Conjunctivitis)
It is an extremely common form of conjunctivitis in the first
month of life and is the most common infection in the neonatal
period. The cause of neonatal conjunctivitis is difficult to
determine because the signs and symptoms do not vary by
cause. The timing and presentation of neonatal conjunctivitis is
very useful in identifying the cause. In order of occurrence, the
common causes of neonatal conjunctivitis include: chemical,
bacterial, and viral.
• Chemical conjunctivitis: It occurs within first 24 hours of
life:
{{ Watery discharge with mild redness of the eye
{{ Minimal swelling of eyelids
{{ Symptoms last for only 24–36 hours

CONCLUSION
With careful questioning and thorough examination,
pediatricians can accurately differentiate among the various
causes of red eye in children and address the common benign
conditions. All newborns with conjunctivitis in first week of
life should be evaluated with Gram staining and culture
and if Gram-negative diplococci are seen, should be treated
with systemic antibiotics. Older infants and toddlers usually
have bacterial conjunctivitis associated with otitis media.
So, their ears need to be evaluated for otitis and if present,
should be treated with oral antibiotics. Viral conjunctivitis
mostly affects older children or adolescents and is associated
with pharyngitis and preauricular lymphadenopathy. It
is a self-limiting disease and requires only conservative
treatment. Allergic conjunctivitis is marked by presence of

Compensatory Head Posture
Manav D Singh

INTRODUCTION

Box 2: Components of abnormal head posture

Compensatory or abnormal head posture (AHP) is not an
uncommon condition in childhood with estimated incidence
of 1.3%. Mostly congenital, it may be an acquired finding.
Although it may be also of orthopedic or neurologic in origin,
our focus will be the one of ocular origin (Box 1).
Box 1: Origin of abnormal head posture
• Orthopedic
• Neurologic

• Ocular

In the process of evolution, humans have acquired
binocular vision with the aim to provide stereopsis or depth
perception or simply accurate assessment of distance. There
are three levels of binocular vision; viz.
1. Simultaneous perception (SP)
2. Fusion
3. Stereopsis.
In general, SP is essential for fusion and fusion is essential
for stereopsis. The neuromuscular system of head and neck
tries to compensate for certain abnormalities of the ocular
motor system (which may be primary or secondary to sensory
visual problems) in an effort to achieve single binocular vision,
to avoid diplopia, or sometimes to achieve clear vision. This
results in AHP.

Clinical Pearl
• Head posture is an adaptation of head and neck musculature
to avoid diplopia and attain fusion and is mostly seen in
congenital disorders.

COMPONENTS OF HEAD POSTURE
Observation of head posture is the first step in the examination
of ophthalmic motor system. This should be done as soon as

ch-141.indd 680

• Chin: elevation or depression (vertical component)
• Face turn: to right or left (horizontal component)
• Head tilt: to right or left shoulder (torsional component)

the patient enters the examination room before he becomes
conscious of being examined. Compensatory head posture
may be partially or totally lost by voluntary effort and lots of
information may, thus, be lost. The abnormal head posture has
three components (Box 2).
Each of them is compensation at different joints of head
and neck to correct respective ocular motility disorders in
an effort to achieve fusion by minimizing deviation. If the
deviation is too large to develop any level of fusion, no effort
may be made for the purpose and no AHP may develop. If
unable to fuse, head posture may also develop to provide
maximal deviation in an effort to suppress or ignore the
peripheral image to avoid diplopia. It is also possible to
develop AHP to permit fusion based on anomalous retinal
correspondence (ARC). Occasionally, a patient with very poor
vision in one eye may develop face turn in the direction of
non-seeing eye in order to improve field of vision (Fig. 1) or to
bring null point in straight gaze if he suffers from nystagmus
(Fig. 2).

INTERPRETATION OF HEAD POSTURE

SENSORY AND MOTOR FUSION

It is instinctual to have clear view of any object lying in the field
of vision. Therefore, once an object enters field of vision, eyes
turn in a way so that its image lies on to fovea. Farther is the
stimulated retinal element located from the fovea, higher is
the incentive for the eye to move or higher is the retinomotor
value of that retinal element. Not to mention, retinomotor
value of fovea is zero. Two eyes of the same person have retinal
elements that share common subjective visual directions.
These are called corresponding retinal points. This sensory
correspondence explains sensory fusion and is the essence
of binocular vision. Alignment of eyes in a way that sensory
fusion can be maintained is called motor fusion. The stimulus

Section 17: Ophthalmology
for sensory fusion is the excitation of corresponding retinal
elements and that of motor fusion is retinal disparity. However,
the ultimate goal of all this is to achieve stereopsis. At retinal
element level, it can be said that stereoscopic vision is the
result of simultaneous stimulation of horizontally disparate
retinal elements. The fusion of these (only horizontally not
vertically) disparate images gives rise to a visual impression
perceived in depth.

The Association of Sensory and
Motor Visual System
The sensory visual system which consists of retinocerebral
apparatus assisted by optico-refractory system of eye has
the primary function of collection of information about the
outside world. However, the visual motor system is entirely
in the service of visual sensory system. Since motor system
has no independent existence, it adapts itself to assist a
malfunctioning sensory system in a way to get the best
results in the form of binocular single and distinct vision at
all points of time. The musculature of head and neck region
may further assist the oculomotor system to achieve the same
goal. Abnormal head posture is only one of such adaptations
to regain this remarkable feature of binocular single vision
inherent in human visual system which helps us to achieve the
function of stereopsis.

Clinical Pearl
• Ocular motor system has no independent existence and
adapts itself exclusively in the service of sensory visual system.

CONFUSION, DIPLOPIA, AND SUPPRESSION
In the presence of manifest deviation of eyes, images of
all objects in binocular field of vision are shifted from
corresponding retinal elements. Thus, images of different
objects are formed on foveae of two eyes leading to a
phenomenon called “confusion”. At the same time, image
of identical object is formed on noncorresponding retinal
elements of two eyes leading to diplopia. To avoid them,
the growing visual system in children has two mechanisms
to develop, viz., “suppression” (more common) in which
poor quality image is ignored by the retinocerebral system
and ARC in which disparate retinal elements acquire the
function of corresponding retinal elements. Diplopia is the
most repugnant sensation and the oculomotor system makes
every effort to avoid this. In congenital and early childhood
extraocular muscle paralysis, suppression will generally ensue
if head posture fails to develop fusion.

CAUSES OF ABNORMAL HEAD POSTURE
The cause of the AHP can be ocular, orthopedic, and
neurologic. The orthopedic causes of AHP include congenital
tightness of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, KlippelFeil anomaly, and brachial-plexus injury. Neurologic causes
of AHP are mainly related to brain tumors, postinflammatory
central nervous system conditions, psychomotor delay, and
focal dystonia. However, only ocular causes will be discussed
in detail.

Incomitant Squint
Paralytic or restrictive musculofascial anomalies can lead
to abnormal head posture. Most patients with paralytic
strabismus habitually hold their head in a position so as to
avoid the field of action of paretic muscle. Diplopia is, thus,
eliminated and binocular single vision attained. A classical
example is congenital superior oblique (SO) palsy (ocular
torticollis) in which patient maintains binocular vision with
the help of compensatory head posture. In case of RSO palsy
(Fig. 3), the child will have chin depression, face turn to
left, and head tilt to left shoulder. The head posture ensures
that the paretic muscle is always in the state of relaxation.
Position of head is then so adjusted that the visual axes are
directed straightforwards. Thus, in case of RSO palsy, with
its main action as depression, chin depression develops and
its secondary action as intorsion, head tilt towards opposite
shoulder develops. Face turn towards left brings the eye
in abduction, so that vertical movements can be executed
exclusively by vertical rectii. Causes of ocular head posture
are given in table 1.
It is important to distinguish, especially from pediatrician’s
point of view, between congenital and ocular torticollis

Clinical Pearls

682

ch-141.indd 682

• Diplopia is the most repugnant sensation
• In childhood abnormalities, if head posture fails to develop
fusion, diplopia will invariably be eradicated by suppression or
anomalous retinal correspondence (ARC)
• Suppression, amblyopia, and ARC are general features of
concomitant squint. However, they can develop in congenital
or early childhood paralytic squint as well.

Ocular torticollis, caused by SO palsy, on the other hand
develops later; the head can be moved easily passively or by
voluntary effort of the patient and SCM muscle if soft like in
any normal human being. However, if an effort is made to
correct the head posture, diplopia generally ensues. If eye
with paretic muscle is occluded, head will straighten by itself
unless some secondary skeletal changes have developed over
a period of time.

Vertical incomitance is not uncommon in horizontal
concomitant deviations (eso- or exotropias). Here, strabismus
is comitant in primary gaze, but becomes incomitant in up
or down gaze or both. They are called A or V patterns. The
characters of common errors are given in table 3.
In these cases, dysfunction of oblique muscles is the most
common clinical finding and treatment is based on clinical
findings.

Nystagmus
Nystagmus is a regular, rhythmic, to and fro movement of
eyes. Two common types of nystagmus are pendular and
jerk nystagmus. Pendular is smooth sinusoidal oscillations

(Table 2). Former is caused by malformation of cervical
vertebrae or fibrosis of SCM muscle, usually secondary to birth
trauma and later by congenital SO palsy. In case of congenital
torticollis, torticollis sets in within 6 months of age, passive
straightening of head is difficult, palpation may suggest
hardening of SCM muscle, no visual disturbances are present
and torticollis is not influenced by occlusion of either eye.

(commonly due to sensory deprivation) whereas jerk
nystagmus has a slow and a fast component. Although fast
component is conventionally labeled as the direction of
nystagmus, the fact is that the primary abnormality causes
slow drift and fast component is the corrective movement. In
case of jerk nystagmus, there may be a gaze, where it cannot
be elicited. This is called the null zone. Cases of nystagmus that
have a null point may have a head posture which can have any
of the three component(s) of head posture (Fig. 2).

Clinical Pearls
• Head posture is present only in jerk nystagmus with null point
• The purpose of head posture is to bring null point in straight
gaze for clear vision
• It is the congenital motor nystagmus that responds best to
surgery.

The surgical correction mainly involves shifting of
null point to primary gaze with the hope that it will lead to
correction of head posture. Workup of a case of abnormal
head posture is given in algorithm 1.

Other Causes
Some uncommon/atypical causes of AHP may also be seen in
clinical situations:
• Ptosis, especially if bilateral, may lead to chin elevation to
minimize restriction of superior field of vision
• One eyed persons (Fig. 1) or those with homonymous
hemianopia (Fig. 5) may assume a head posture to center
their gaze to the available field
• Strabismus fixus is an extremely large esotropic deviation
of both eyes seen in patients with maximum contracture
of medial rectus (MR) muscles secondary to replacement
by fibrous tissue. A rarer variety may have fibrous band
replacing lateral rectii leading to anchorage of both eyes in

abduction (Fig. 6A). Patient may adopt a head posture to
center his/her gaze through the better seeing eye (Fig. 6B)
Undercorrected glasses may result in head posture in
an effort to take advantage of higher effective power in
peripheral part of the lens
Ocular/systemic syndromes like Brown’s (SO tendon
sheath) syndrome or Duane syndrome, Mobius syndrome,
progressive external ophthalmoplegia (alone or as part of
Kearns-Sayre syndrome) may also lead to AHP
Orthopedic and neurologic causes more than what has
already been mentioned are beyond the scope of this
chapter.

HISTORY AND EXAMINATION
History starts with age of patient at time onset of head posture,
whether congenital or acquired. Sometimes, parents may
have noticed it much later than its actual appearance. This
can be confirmed by a careful scrutiny of family photographs.
Associated visual disturbances, refractive errors, ocular
motility disturbances, presence of diplopia at present or in
past, abnormal movements of eyeballs, problems of movement
of head and neck region are all very important to find out
the cause and plan management. History of neurological
symptoms like headache, vomiting, convulsions, or of
infections like meningitis and encephalitis are also important
in relevant cases.
Assessment of head posture is the first step in any
ophthalmic examination and especially so in a squint clinic. It
is prudent to start this examination as soon as patient enters
examiners room and certainly before the child becomes
conscious of the fact that he is being examined. Examiner
should not only look for components of head posture, but also
do a comprehensive eye examination. Visual acuity, refractive
status, presence of any amblyopia, squint, restriction of ocular
motility in any of the nine directions of gaze, difference in

ocular deviation in different directions of gaze and while
separately fixing each eye, presence of nystagmus, effect of
occlusion of individual eye on the head posture need to be
assessed. Diagnosing horizontal muscle palsy is, generally,
not difficult. However, diagnosis of isolated cyclovertical
muscle paresis, e.g., trochlear nerve paresis requires threestep evaluation, viz., side of hyperopia, side of gaze in which
vertical deviation increases, and then tilting the head towards

ch-141.indd 685

shoulders and observing on which side the vertical deviation
increases. Patient maintains a head posture of head tilt with
least disparity, the disparity increases if head is forced towards
the shoulder on the side of the paretic SO (Bielschowsky sign).
Assessment for restriction of passive movements of neck and
hardness in SCM muscle is very essential to exclude nonocular
causes of head posture (Algorithm 1). Forced duction test is
invaluable in cases of suspected restrictive problem. One may

refer to any standard book on squint for details of methods of
examination. Examination of nervous system, especially of
cranial nerves, may be very informative in relevant cases.

INVESTIGATIONS
Apart from specific ophthalmic investigations like Hess’s (or
Lee’s) charting, imaging of brain using computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be
required, especially in acquired cases to find out the cause or to
plan the treatment. Certain electrophysiological investigations
like electromyography and electronystagmography (Fig. 2)
may be invaluable in the management of certain case, and also
from academic point of view.

MANAGEMENT
Management depends on age at presentation and cause.
Among congenital conditions, although no treatment is
warranted in certain cases, early treatment may be indicated
in others before permanent secondary skeletal changes get
established. However, in acquired cases, generally, a 6-month
waiting period is given for the system to heal by itself (Algorithm
1). However, nonsurgical treatment like prisms or occlusion
may be temporarily prescribed to give relief to the patient from
intractable diplopia. Indications of therapy are diplopia in
the practical field of fixation and inability to maintain fusion
without cosmetically acceptable head posture.

Nonsurgical Treatment
Correction of refractive error and amblyopia should be done
in all cases. Prisms (in small ocular deviations) and occlusion
may be indicated to avoid diplopia during acute phase or
while waiting for surgery. Prisms are usually effective in
correcting diplopia up to a deviation of 10 prism diopter.
Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin may be helpful
in cases of acute horizontal muscle paralysis, in dissociated
vertical deviations, and as postsurgical adjunct.

Surgical Treatment
The aim of treatment is to develop single binocular vision
or provide clear vision without the presence of AHP. Type
of preferred surgical technique depends on the cause and
duration of problem.

Paralytic Squint

686

In paralytic squint, general principle is to wait for 6 months
for natural recovery and then to weaken the antagonist and to
minimize innervations to the paretic muscle. Strengthening
operations for paretic muscle are less effective. In case of
paralysis of sixth nerve, surgery will generally consist of MR
recession and lateral rectus (LR) resection or transposition of
vertical rectii lateral along with weakening of MR. Congenital
superior rectus palsy with significant head posture should
undergo surgery, as soon as diagnosis is confirmed, to prevent
permanent torticollis, facial asymmetry, and scoliosis. For
acquired fourth nerve paresis, after ruling out underlying

ch-141.indd 686

disease and waiting for spontaneous recovery, recession of
antagonist muscle or weakening of yoke muscle of paralyzed
muscle may be done depending on presence or absence of
contraction of antagonist. In congenital third nerve palsy,
surgery is required for exotropia, hypotropia, and ptosis. Bell’s
phenomenon should be evaluated as there is significant risk
of exposure keratitis following surgery. Acquired third nerve
palsy is in children, is generally because of trauma, infections,
tumors, aneurysm, or migraine. Treatment is of underlying
cause. Residual diplopia and/or ptosis may require surgical
correction depending on individual situation as the palsy is
generally incomplete.

A and V Phenomenon
In cases with oblique over action, oblique muscles should be
weakened (inferior oblique for V patterns and SO for A patterns)
in addition to recession resection of horizontal rectii. However,
in the absence of this feature, 5–8 mm of vertical transposition
of horizontal rectii combined with their recession-resection
may suffice. For the correction of A patterns, MR is shifted up
and LR is shifted down. The opposite is done for patients with
V patterns.

Nystagmus
Surgery for nystagmus is based on three principles, viz.,:
1. To shift null point to primary position (Fig. 2)
2. To induce extra convergence innervations by weakening
medial recti
3. To reduce muscle force by weakening all rectii to dampen
amplitude of nystagmus.

Other Causes
Ptosis is generally corrected by resection of levator palpebrae
superioris (LPS) muscle or by sling surgery. The choice of
operation is generally dependent on amount of ptosis, LPS
action present, Bell’s phenomenon, and associated features.
Causes of head posture other than these are treated by surgical/
nonsurgical methods from case-to-case basis.

Pediatric Epiphora
Shashi Vashisht

INTRODUCTION
Ocular surface is covered by a thin tear film which provides
a smooth optical surface, keeps the ocular surface moist and
plays an important role in the nutrition and protection of
cornea. Overflow of tears leads to watering from the eyes.
Tear film consists of three layers:
1. Superficial lipid layer: derived from secretions of
Meibomian, Zeiss, and Moll glands
2. Middle aqueous layer: secreted by lacrimal and accessory
lacrimal glands
3. Deep mucus layer: secretions principally from conjunctival
goblet cells.

THE OUTFLOW PATHWAY FOR TEARS
•
•

•
•

Lacrimal puncta: a small oval opening near the inner
canthus on upper and lower lids
Lacrimal canaliculi: two superior and inferior lacrimal
canaliculi extending from superior and inferior lacrimal
puncta, respectively, to lacrimal sac. They are directed 2
mm vertically and 8 mm horizontally. Before entering into
the lacrimal sac, they join and form a common canaliculus
in majority of cases
Lacrimal sac: it is located in lacrimal fossa in anterior part
of medial orbital wall
Nasolacrimal duct (NLD): it is a continuation of the
lacrimal sac. It is about 18 mm long, directed downwards,
backwards, and laterally and opens in the inferior meatus
of nose.

DEVELOPMENT OF
LACRIMAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM
The lacrimal drainage system is ectodermal in origin. The
lacrimal sac develops as a solid cord of ectoderm which sends
two columns to the lids which form the canaliculi. The solid
cord descends down to form the NLD. This is met by a similar

ch-142.indd 687

Fig. 1: Tear production and outflow pathway (lacrimal pathway)

structure from the primitive nasal cord. This solid cord starts
canalizing around 3 months of intrauterine life to form the
NLD. It is generally canalized by birth or few weeks before.
However, in some cases, ectodermal debris or a membrane
may remain at the nasal end of the NLD resulting in congenital
NLD block. Tear formation generally starts after second week
of birth (Fig. 1).

Causes of Watering of Eyes in
Relation to Lacrimal System
Hyperlacrimation
There is increased secretion of tears due to any of the following
causes:
• Primary: overproduction from lacrimal gland, which is rare
• Reflex: secondary to ocular inflammation or ocular surface
disease (cornea and conjunctiva) due to stimulation of
sensory branches of fifth nerve.

Epiphora

Ophthalmia Neonatorum

This is a condition that constitutes inadequate drainage of
tears due to any of the following reasons:
• Physiological: lacrimal pump failure secondarily to lower
lid laxity or weakness of orbicularis muscle
• Mechanical: obstruction in outflow pathway involving any
of its components, i.e., punctum, canaliculus, lacrimal
sac, or NLD. Treatment is discussed later. Causes and
management of epiphora in infants and children are
enlisted in table 1.

Ophthalmia neonatorum (ON) is generally seen in the first
week of birth. Any infection in the first month of a baby’s life
can be classified as ON. There is copious discharge, swollen
lids, and watering without regurgitation. Conjunctival swab
should be sent for Gram’s stain and culture (Table 2).

Infective Causes
Depending on the causative organism suspected anti­
microbial/antiviral eye drops/ointment started under
ophthalmic supervision.

Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) or spring catarrh is seen in
children of 4–20 years of age. This condition is more common
in boys than girls. It is an immunoglobulin E-mediated
hypersensitivity reaction to exogenous allergens. Recurrent
bilateral redness, itching, photophobia, and watering occur
with onset of summer season. The term “spring catarrh” is a

of cases undergo remission in late teens. Pharmacological
treatment constitutes following:
• Mast cell stabilizers, e.g., sodium cromoglycate 2% eye
drops
• Topical antihistaminics, e.g., olopatadine 0.1% eye drops
• Topical steroids eye drops give a quick relief, but their use
should be minimized and monitored as indiscriminate use
of steroids can lead to steroid-induced glaucoma
• Topical cyclosporine 1% eye drop.

Clinical Pearl
• In a child complaining of recurrent redness, itching, and
watering in both the eyes with onset of summer season, most
common cause is vernal keratoconjunctivitis.

WORKUP
History
Complete history should be taken including time of onset and
duration of watering, unilateral/bilateral, any contributory
cause, associated symptoms, seasonal variation, and previous
treatment taken.

Clinical Examination with Torch light
•
•
•
•
•

•

Examine the lacrimal sac area for fullness, redness, or
fistula
Regurgitation test: reflux of mucoid or mucopurulent
material from the punctum on pressure over the lacrimal
sac area suggests blocked NLD or mucocele
Inspect lacrimal puncta for eversion or stenosis
Examine eyelids for any skin lesions, entropion, ectropion,
trichiasis, stye, blepharitis
Examination of the conjunctiva for congestion, discharge,
foreign body, tear, cyst, discoloration, chemosis, follicles,
papillae (VKC), concretions, pterygium, pinguecula,
tumors, or any other abnormality
Further examination should be done by an ophthalmologist.

Features of Congenital Obstruction of
Nasolacrimal Duct
•

•

The lacrimal gland starts secreting around 2–3 weeks after
birth. Therefore, effect of NLD block is not seen at birth. This
is seen in around 4–8% of newborns. It is more common in
premature children. It may be uni- or bilateral and has no
sex predilection. A membranous block at the lower end of
NLD (valve of Hasner) is common, as this portion of NLD
is last to canalize. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs in
90% of cases in first year. Other causes could be stenosis of
opening of NLD or a hypertrophied inferior nasal turbinate
Watering with or without mucoid/mucopurulent discharge
and/or matting of lashes is seen

It may be constant or intermittent. Severity of signs and
symptoms can vary with upper respiratory tract infection
(URI), exposure to cold and wind. Pressure over the sac
may result in positive regurgitation from the puncta.
Gradually, secretions start stagnating in the sac and can
give rise to recurrent infection. Chronic infection can lead
to dacryocystitis and fistula formation
Congenital block can involve any other part of the drainage
system.

• Blocked nasolacrimal duct is the most common cause of
watering in infants.

Tests to Check for Nasolacrimal Duct Block
Sac Syringing
It is done to know patency of lacrimal drainage system. Under
local/limited general anesthesia lower punctum is dilated with
a punctum dilator. A blunt tipped lacrimal cannula on a 2 mL
syringe filled with saline is inserted into lower punctum and
canaliculus and the plunger is pushed slowly. Management is
done as per observations after syringing.

Jones Dye Test
•
•

Primary test: it is a test for lacrimal outflow function
Secondary test: it is done in cases of negative primary test.

Fluorescein Dye Disappearance Test
Fluorescein 2% drops are instilled in both conjunctival fornices.
Normally, no dye remains after 3 minutes. Prolonged retention
is inferred as inadequate lacrimal drainage.
There are multiple other tests, like contrast dacryo­
cystography, nuclear lacrimal scintigraphy, Schirmer’s test,
tests to check tear film and ocular surface but they are done at
an ophthalmic set-up.

Clinical Pearl
• When cause of watering is in doubt, ophthalmology reference
is mandatory.

Management of Congenital Blockage
of Nasolacrimal Duct
Sac massage is the mainstay, as spontaneous resolution
occurs in 90% of cases within first year. Management of
congenital blockage of nasolacrimal duct has been outlined
in algorithm 1.
• Sac massage: the child’s head should be held firmly. Mother
is instructed to compress the sac area by applying firm,
gentle pressure with the pulp of index finger such that finger
blocks the common canalicular opening. This finger is then

surgically creating anastomosis between the sac and
nasal mucosa. This procedure can be performed by
external approach or nasal approach.

CONCLUSION
Watering from eyes in childhood is a fairly common complaint.
The cause needs to be diagnosed before starting treatment.

Key points

))
Proper history taking and examination is important to come
to a diagnosis. It nasolacrimal duct obstruction is the most
common cause of epiphora in infants. In most of the cases, it
can be treated conservatively. It is imperative that the proper
procedure of sac massage be explained to the attendant and
reassurance given. When in doubt, ophthalmic referral must
be done.

SUGGESTED READINGS

firmly moved down the side of nose. Procedure is repeated
3–4 times a day (4–5 times every sitting) and it is followed
by instillation of antibiotic (tobramycin or ciprofloxacin
eye drops). By doing this massage, hydrostatic pressure in
the lacrimal sac increases and it may rupture membranous
obstructions and/or displace the debris
• Probing: if sac massage fails, probing and syringing is done
under general anesthesia. Age at which massage should
be discontinued and probing done is controversial. Early
intervention at 6–8 months of age has advantage of high
success rate and prevents long-standing infections. Late
intervention at about 12 months has an advantage as
many cases show spontaneous resolution by a year. This
obviates the need of surgical intervention. Probing should
be avoided if the child has URI. Sac massage should be
continued after probing.
In case of failure, probing can be repeated after 3–4 weeks.
If need be, inferior turbinate infracture can be done at the same
time.
• In case of failed probing:
{{ Intubation with silicone tube can be done
{{ Balloon dacryoplasty can be done
{{ Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): if child presents late,
after 3 years of age or if repeated probing fails, then
DCR is done. In this procedure, NLD is bypassed by

Deviation of Eyes
Taru Dewan, Harshika Chawla

INTRODUCTION
Early and accurate detection of ocular motility disorders in
children can present a challenge for family physicians. Children
may not be willing to participate in the screening process,
and interesting fixation devices are often not available in the
office. In addition, some of the diagnoses are complex. The
involvement of pediatric ophthalmologists with specialized
training, expertise, and examination equipment is, therefore,
often required. Despite these difficulties, most significant eye
problems in children can be identified with effective screening
techniques.

Hypo—the term for an eye whose gaze is directed lower
Torsional strabismus: occurs when the eyes rotate around
the anterior-posterior axis to become misaligned, viz.,
incyclotorsion and excyclotorsion.
Combined: can be horizontal, vertical, torsional, or any
combination thereof.

{{

•
•

Based on Latency
•

STRABISMUS

Latent squint (heterophoria): it is present only when
binocularity is disrupted, e.g., when covering an eye.
Such a patient has normal fusion mechanisms. Latent
strabismus is precipitated in conditions of ocular fatigue,
general debility, etc.

Strabismus may result from a variety of ocular or systemic
conditions. On the other hand, it can lead to severe visually
disabling consequences (amblyopia, abnormal head posture,
loss of binocularity, etc.).
The term “strabismus” is derived from the Greek word
strabismos, to squint/to look obliquely/askance. Strabismus
means ocular misalignment. The image is therefore not in
corresponding areas of both eyes, which may result in eventual
amblyopia in childhood or diplopia in adulthood.
A

CLASSIFICATION
There are several classifications that are used for strabismus.

Based on Direction
•

Horizontal deviations are classified into two varieties:
Eso—describes inward (Fig. 1A)
{{ Exo—describes outward misalignment (Fig. 1B)
Vertical deviations can be:
{{ Hyper—the term for an eye whose gaze is directed
higher than the fellow eye

11/22/2016 11:40:58 AM

Section 17: Ophthalmology
•

Manifest squint (heterotropia): it is present even when
patient views binocularly, i.e., even without occluding an
eye. Such patients cannot align gaze to achieve fusion and
children with manifest squint usually develop amblyopia
and adults present with diplopia.

Clinical Pearl
• The type of squint and the response to treatment in other
family members may be similar.

Based on Onset
•
•

Infantile: deviation documented at birth or before 6 months
of age, presumably related to a defect present at birth
Acquired: a deviation with later onset, after a period of
apparently normal visual development.

CLINICAL FEATURES
•

Based on Constancy
•
•

Constant: when one eye consistently deviates
Intermittent: when the deviation is not present all the time
and may be noticeable for limited time during the day.

•

Based on Comitance
•
•

Comitant strabismus: the size of deviation does not vary
significantly with the gaze or eye used for fixating
Noncomitant (incomitant) strabismus: the deviation varies
in size significantly with the gaze or eye used for fixating.

Based on Etiology
•
•

Paretic strabismus: due to paralysis of one or several
extraocular muscles
Non-paretic strabismus: due to causes other than paralysis
of extraocular muscles.

Clinical Pearl
• Increased prevalence of strabismus has been reported in
association with assisted delivery (forceps or cesarean section),
low-birth-weight (including premature infants) and maternal
drug abuse.

Clinical Pearl
• Pseudostrabismus is the false appearance of strabismus. It
generally occurs in infants and toddlers whose bridge of the
nose is wide and flat, causing the appearance of esotropia. With
age, the bridge of the child’s nose narrows and the folds in the
corner of the eyes become less prominent. Pseudoexotropia
occurs with a wide interpupillary distance or a positive angle
kappa.

ETIOLOGY

692

Etiology of strabismus is generally presumptive, especially
in congenital and nonparalytic cases. Development of
nonparalytic squint is a result of factors which affect
development of normal binocularity. Binocular vision and
coordination of ocular movements is an acquired process
which completely develops by the age of 5–6 years.
Factors, which hinder normal binocular development,
can be:
• Sensory: uncorrected refractive error, corneal opacity or
cataract, optic atrophy, macular disorder, etc.
• Motor: abnormal extraocular muscles or fascia, abnormal
accommodation or convergence
• Central: abnormal cortical control of ocular movements.
Heredity does play a major role but a distinct genetic
pattern for strabismus has not been identified.

Pupillary reactions: light reflex may be abnormal in
diseases of optic nerve or retina
Hirschberg’s reflex test: it gives a rough estimate on the
degree of manifest squint. Shine a pen torch into the
patient’s eyes at an arm’s length away and ask them to look
at the light (babies will tend to look towards it). Observe
where the reflection of the pen torch lies with respect to
the cornea. Normally, it should be central bilaterally. One
millimeter of decentration of reflex corresponds to about
7° of deviation. When the reflection is at the margin of the
pupil, there is approximately 15° deviation, and, if it lies at
the edge of the cornea, there is approximately 45° deviation
Perform the cover/uncover test; if this appears to be
normal, try the alternate cover test:
{{ Cover/uncover test: it confirms the presence of
heterophoria. Patient is asked to focus on a target
held in front of him (at 33 cm). One eye is completely
occluded for several seconds and the uncovered eye is
observed for movement as it focuses on the object. This
eye is then covered and the other eye is observed for
movement. Movement of the eye outwards confirms
that there is an esodeviation (i.e., the eye was turned
inwards initially) and vice versa for exodeviation. The
test is repeated for objects at 6 m
{{ Alternate cover test: it differentiates comitant from
noncomitant variety and it also tells us about the
fixation behavior. The occluder is rapidly switched
from one eye to the other. Observing the eye movement
as the occluder is removed, depending on whether it
moves inwards (i.e., there is an exophoria and the eye
has to move in to see again) or outwards (revealing an
esophoria) confirms the type of strabismus
{{ Prism bar cover test (Algorithm 1): it is the most popular
and informative method to estimate the amount of
squint objectively. Prisms of increasing strength with
apex towards the direction of deviation are placed
over one eye and patient is asked to fixate a target with

Algorithm 1
Prism bar cover test

{{

the other eye. Alternate cover test is done till there is
no recovery movement of the deviating eye under the
prism bar
Krimsky prism bar reflex test (PBRT): in cases with
poor vision in one eye, when patient cannot focus on
fixation target, use of PBRT comes into play.

MANAGEMENT
•

•

•
•

Referral: a neonate with a constant squint or with a squint
that is worsening should be referred to an ophthalmologist.
The earlier the referral, the better chance the child has of
avoiding the possibility of amblyopia
Assessment: there will be both an orthoptic assessment
(to assess the visual acuity and ascertain the presence and
nature of the squint) as well as a medical review to ensure
that the eye is otherwise healthy
Detailed neurological assessment may be required only in
cases of paretic squints
General approaches (Algorithms 2 and 3):
{{ Treatment is guided by the exact nature of the squint
and by the patient’s age
{{ Correction of refractive errors will be the first step. In
the subset of accommodative esotropia, appropriate
refractive correction might be the only thing required.
The true amount of surgically correctable deviation is
assessed only after refractive correction
{{ Any concurrent amblyopia will need treating too
{{ Practical considerations include using plastic instead
of glass lenses for spectacles made for children and
ensuring that the lenses are large enough to prevent the
child from looking over them
{{ Frequent refractions under full cycloplegia may be
required at short time intervals
{{ Some patients are treated with prisms (placed
on spectacle lenses), miotics or other methods of
nonsurgical management
{{ Most patients may require surgical alignment which
may be done using muscle recession (it is moved
backwards on the globe and so its action is weakened)
and/or antagonistic muscle resection (a segment
of muscle is removed, so strengthening its action).
Sometimes, it takes more than one procedure to get the
satisfactory result.

Clinical Pearl
• Infantile esotropia is best managed with early surgical
intervention to optimize outcome. There is evidence that early
surgery is associated with better binocular outcome.

PROGNOSIS
This depends on the nature and degree of the squint and level
of sensory development. Generally, early intervention should
produce good alignment and limit any amblyopia but perfect
stereopsis is rarely achieved.

Decreased Vision in Children
Shikha Jain

INTRODUCTION
Decreased vision in children should be a cause of concern for
all ophthalmologists, as well as nonophthalmologists; because
if not corrected appropriately in time, it can cause amblyopia
leading to permanent vision loss.

NORMAL VISUAL DEVELOPMENT

Table 1: Common causes of decreased or blurred vision in
children
<2 years
• Cataract
• Congenital glaucoma
• Strabismus
• Corneal opacity/corneal ulcer
• Orbital cellulitis

Visual development is a highly complex maturation process.
Visual system is immature at birth. Myelination of optic nerve,
development of visual cortex, and growth of lateral geniculate
body occur over the first 2 years of life.

Visual Milestones
Pupillary light reflex is usually present after 31 weeks of
gestation but it can be difficult to evaluate due to miosis in
newborn. A blink reflex to light is usually present several days
after birth. At 6 weeks of age, baby should be able to make
and maintain eye contact and react with facial expressions. At
2–3 months of age, a child is usually interested in bright lights
although premature infants may reach these landmarks later.
Disconjugate eye movements may be noted initially but should
not persist beyond 4 months.

Signs of Poor Visual Development
Some of the findings which should point to the examining
pediatrician for a need for detailed examination and referral to
an ophthalmologist are:
• Wandering eye movements
• No response to familiar faces and objects
• Nystagmus
• Staring at bright light and forceful rubbing of eyes in a
visually disinterested infant (oculodigital reflex).
The common causes of decreased or blurred vision in
children are given in table 1.

• Refractive errors
• Trauma
• Trachoma
• Hyphema/hypopyon
• Iridocyclitis
• Retinoblastoma
• Xerophthalmia

Approach to an Infant with Decreased Vision
History
A careful history is essential. Antenatal history should include
maternal infection, radiation, drugs, or any history of trauma.
Perinatal history should include prematurity, birth weight,
intrauterine growth retardation, fetal distress, meconium
staining, forceps delivery, and any history of supplemental
oxygen therapy in immediate postpartum period

Examination
For a pediatrician, a thorough torch light examination can
yield rewarding results. Following points should be carefully
documented:
• Ptosis: normally the upper lid covers one-sixth of the cornea
and the lower lid rests at the inferior margin of cornea. Any
dropping of lids more than this can be classified as ptosis.
In severe ptosis, the lower margin of the lid may cover the
pupil resulting in decreased vision
• Visual fixation of the child should be noted. This is done
by shining a torch light and noting the corneal reflex. The
reflex should be in the center of the pupil and the child
should follow the light as it is moved to and fro

Decreased vision in children

•

Ocular alignment, motility, and the presence of nystagmus
or roving eye movements are important to be documented.
Monocular cover-uncover test is the most important test
for detecting the presence of manifest strabismus. As one
eye is covered, the examiner watches for any movement
in opposite noncovered eye, such movement indicates the
presence of a tropia. Movement of covered eye in opposite
direction as the cover is removed indicates a phoria that
becomes manifest when binocularity is interrupted
• Cornea: any obvious corneal haze or opacity should be
documented. It can be an indicator of glaucoma, Peters
anomaly, sclerocornea, and mucopolysaccharide storage
disorders among other causes
• Pupil: it is normally grayish black in color. White reflex of
the pupil is known as leukocoria.
Causes of leukocoria are:
• Cataract
• Retinoblastoma
• Retinopathy of prematurity
• Chorioretinal colobomas
• Uveitis
• Toxocariasis
• Tumors, e.g., hamartomas, choroidal hemangiomas. Size
of the normal pupil is 3–4 cm. A dilated or a miosed pupil
may indicate some pathology, e.g., optic nerve lesion may
have a dilated pupil while Horner’s syndrome and some
poisoning present with miosed pupil
• Pupillary reflex: a note should be made of the equality and
briskness of pupillary responses.

ch-144.indd 697

ASSESSMENT OF VISUAL ACUITY
Infants
In infants it can be assessed by various methods:
• Fixation behavior: It has three components—central,
steady, and maintained (CSM) fixation.
{{ C: after covering one eye of the patient corneal light
reflex is noted as the patient fixates the examiner’s light.
The light reflex should be near the center of cornea
{{ S: steadiness of fixation as the light is held motionless
and then moved slowly
{{ M: ability to maintain alignment with both eyes as the
other eye is uncovered
• Optokinetic nystagmus: the patient follows a moving
object, which then moves out of the field of vision at which
point the eyes move back to the original position.The reflex
develops at about 6 months of age
• Preferential looking: the child is presented with two
stimulus fields, one with alternating stripes and the
other with a homogeneous gray area of the same average
luminance as the striped field. It is based on the concept
that the child will prefer to look at the more interesting
stripes if he/she can detect them
• Visual evoked potential: it measures acuity by assessing
the response of the brain to alternating black and whites
stripes or checks. Three small electrodes are placed on the
child’s head which are connected to a computer. When
the child looks at the stripes, the signal is picked up by the
electrodes.

Toddlers
Allen’s picture cards are used which consist of familiar objects,
e.g., cake, car, horse, duck, etc. (Fig. 1).

Preschoolers
Matching cards are used, e.g., HOTV cards, where the child has
to pick a matching card to that shown from a group of cards
(Fig. 2). Other useful tests include Landolt Rings (C) test or
Tumbling “E” test (Fig. 3).

School-aged Children
In school-aged children, Snellen’s visual acuity is usually done
(Fig. 4).

Clinical Pearl
• Use of pinhole helps to give us an estimate of best corrected
visual acuity though it can be cumbersome in children.

CONCLUSION
Fig. 1: Allen picture cards

In conclusion, it can be said that various features picked up on
a simple torch light examination when taken in conjunction
with the presenting symptoms give a fair idea of the need for
an appropriate and timely ophthalmological reference.

Hearing Screening and
Management in Newborn
Atul Ahuja

Introduction

Box 1: The high risk register

The importance of hearing screening in the newborn cannot
be overemphasized. Though it is one of the most common
congenital anomalies it is not obvious to the uninitiated till
very late (Table 1).
It is therefore surprising that the newborn screening
programs of most hospitals screen for many of the less frequent
conditions while omitting the newborn hearing screening.
One of the reasons cited is that for a newborn to be
screened the presence of risk factors is a must. For this an High
Risk Register (HRR) was used (Box 1).

Clinical Pearl
• Almost 50% children born with hearing impairment have no
known risk factors
• Therefore high risk register is not good enough.

IMPORTANCE OF SCREENING THE NEWBORN
Unlike many other congenital deformities the consequences of
a hearing impairment keep worsening as the child grows older.
Unfortunately hearing loss is not detected early as it is invisible
and no antenatal predictive tests.

List of situations where a hearing impairment can be expected:
• Family history of permanent childhood sensorineural hearing
loss
• In utero infection such as cytomegalovirus, rubella toxoplasmosis
or herpes
• Craniofacial anomalies, including those with morphological
abnormalities of the pinna and ear canal
• Neonatal indicators, specifically hyperbilirubinemia at a serum
level requiring exchange transfusion, persistent pulmonary
hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) associated with mechanical
ventilation, and conditions requiring the use of extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
• Postnatal infections associated with sensorineural hearing loss,
including bacterial meningitis
• Stigmata or other findings associated with a syndrome known to
include a sensorineural or conductive hearing loss or eustachian
tube dysfunction
• Syndromes associated with progressive hearing loss such as
neurofibromatosis, osteopetrosis, and Usher syndrome
• Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Hunter syndrome, or
sensory motor neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth
syndrome
• Parental or caregiver concern regarding hearing, speech,
language, and/or developmental delay
• Head trauma
• Recurrent or persistent otitis media with effusion lasting for at
least 3 months

The development of speech, social development and
emotional bonding of a child are dependent on normal.
During the first few months the child’s brain grows
tremendously. During this period the areas of brain
responsible for hearing if not stimulated consistently by sound
are reallocated other functions (encroachment), pathways fail
to develop and the ganglion cell population decreases.

11/22/2016 11:47:41 AM

Section 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat
Once this critical time period elapses even proper
amplification will not help this child.
It is therefore important to detect hearing loss early. Studies
have revealed that early intervention (before 6 months of age)
allows infants to develop normal speech and language at par
with his normal hearing peers. Even children receiving help
after 7 months of age lag behind those receiving amplification
before 6 months of age.
Traditional techniques detect hearing impairment at an
average age of 2.5 years. Although children who had severe-toprofound hearing loss or multiple disabilities were identified
at or before age 2.5 years, children with mild-to-moderate
hearing loss were often not identified until school age (i.e., 4
years). Studies have indicated that, as a result of the universal
newborn hearing screening program in various countries, the
mean age of diagnosis was 3.9 months, with a mean age of
intervention of 6.1 months.
Another common myth amongst clinicians is that simply
clapping next to the infant is enough to assess the hearing.
There are major pitfalls to this technique:
• Children can compensate for hearing loss and clapping
may create a slight breeze to which the baby may react. The
child may even react to parental expressions reactions or
even shadows
• Even if this were to elicit a startle response, it does not
properly assess the babies hearing. As mentioned before
mild to moderate hearing loss can also be damaging to the
speech and language development of the child.

SCREENING TECHNIQUES

Clinical Pearl
• Traditional techniques of bedside testing are inadequate
and cannot detect moderate hearing impairment, which is
responsible for most speech delays.

ch-145.indd 700

Automated Otoacoustic Emission (Kemp, 1978)
Tests the integrity of the cochlea:
A small soft tipped earpiece (with and integrated mike and
speaker) is placed in the outer part of the baby’s ear; this sends
very soft clicking sounds down the ear.
This sound is transmitted to the tympanic membrane, the
ossicles and eventually the cochlea. Within the cochlea the
sound is picked up by the outer hair cells which start vibrating,
moving tectorial membrane. This in turn stimulates inner hair
cells.
The vibration of outer hair cells transfers energy back to
endolymph and perilymph. These vibrations are transmitted
back along the same path through which they were conducted.
These are then picked up as clicks by a microphone which
is integrated into the same earpiece.
Automated oto-acoustic emissions are fast, efficient and
objective screening test of peripheral auditory sensitivity
(preneural cochlear function). Overcoming major hurdles in
neonatal testing.
However, the effectiveness of the test is reduced by
contamination with low-frequency ambient noise in a busy
nursery, vernix in the ear canal, or any middle ear pathology.
Automated oto-acoustic emissions alone however may
not be a sufficient screening tool in infants who are at risk for
neural hearing loss (e.g., auditory neuropathy/dyssynchrony)
as they test only the cochlea, not the nerve (Fig. 1).

Automated Auditory Brainstem Responses
Automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) is a rapid
electrophysiologic test that is used to assess auditory function
from the eighth nerve through the auditory brainstem. This
test was developed to supplement the results of AABR.
Though quite specific it is not as sensitive as an ABR
(Auditory Brainstem Responses/Brainstem Evoked Response
Audiometry). Together with AOAE, AABR forms a very
powerful screening tool in newborn and infants.

Fig. 1: Organ of corti

11/22/2016 11:47:42 AM

Chapter 145: Hearing Screening and Management in Newborn
For the purpose of AABR measurements disposable surface
electrodes are placed high on the forehead and on the mastoid
and electrical activity traced. The stimulus is in the form of
clicks [generally set at 35 dB hearing level (HL)] is delivered
using small disposable earphones designed to attenuate
background noise.
Automated auditory brainstem response system as the
name suggests automatically first checks the reproducibility of
the wave forms, then compares the infant’s waveform with that
of a template. This has been developed from normative ABR
infant data. The results of this test are just in the form of either
pass or fail, and the test can be conducted in the presence of
background noise.
It lacks frequency-specific information.
The AABR test is solely a screening technique designed
to identify infants who require follow-up testing. It cannot be
used to determine the degree or nature of the hearing loss.
Automated auditory brainstem responses cannot however
detect mild hearing loss and thus should be combined with
AOAE.

Auditory Brainstem Responses
The most common application of auditory evoked responses
is ABR audiometry. These were first described by Jewett and
Williston in 1971.
In ABR an insert phone is introduced into the external
auditory canal and sound inputs in the form of clicks or

tone beeps given. This generates an electrical response in
the auditory (neural) pathways. These responses are picked
up by electrodes placed on the forehead or the vertex and
mastoid processes. The sum total of the electrical responses is
calculated and mapped out as waveforms. These are charted
out as a function of time much like an ECG. These are usually
detected within 10 milliseconds of a click stimulus. These are
consistently picked up with click stimuli in the amplitude
range of 70–90 dB. These waveforms are labeled as waves
I–VII, each denoting an important structure in the auditory
pathway. Though the origin of the waveforms is still being
debated, the following are the most commonly accepted.
• Cochlear Nerve—I
• Cochlear Nucleus—II
• Sup Olivary Nuc—III
• Lat. Laminiscus—IV
• Inf. Colliculus—V
• Med. Geniculate—VI
• Auditory Radiatn—VII
Auditory brainstem response gives us a good idea about
the integrity of the auditory pathways and to some extent the
threshold of hearing; however, it should be used in conjunction
with clinical assessment and behavioral audiometry as it is not
a substitute for these.

Auditory Steady State Response
This is an advance over the ABR/BERA as it tests both the bone
and air conduction for four frequencies, i.e., 500, 1000, 2000, and
4000 Hz. This gives us a good idea about the sound conduction
through the middle ear system and the auditory pathways. It
allows us to assess children not assessable through behavioral
methods and since it gives us a fair idea of frequency specific
thresholds, it helps in fitting hearing aids as well.

SCREENING PROTOCOLS FOR NEWBORN
All patients with unilateral atresia, suspected/confirmed
bacterial meningitis undergo era directly.

Clinical Pearls

Fig. 2: The auditory pathway.

• If there is a delay in sound stimulation, cortical areas in the
brain get encroached and subsequent amplification does not
have the desired effect
• Unless amplification is initiated before 6 months of age an
infant does not keep up with its peers
• Hearing impairment could also be a sign of associated
syndromic disorders. Patients should have a thyroid profile, eye
exam, renal and cardiac assessment
• It is valuable to take a detailed consultation with an
experienced pediatric neurologist to assess milestone delays
and development.

Key points

))
The importance of hearing assessment in neonates cannot be overemphasized

The traditional techniques of assessment are not very accurate and cannot detect mild to moderate hearing impairment. By the time it
becomes apparent to the parents its quite late and such children seldom catch up with their peers since amplification is started too late

Hoarseness in
Pediatric Age Group
Kumud K Handa, Aru C Handa, Dilip Samal

INTRODUCTION
Hoarseness or dysphonia is defined as an abnormality in voice
quality that arises because of dysfunction in vocal cord vibratory
function, causing impairment in proper communication.
Normal voice is produced by the fine vibratory function of
the vocal cords that may get deranged because of structural
abnormality of vocal cords or due to any functional deficit.
Childhood hoarseness is not an uncommon entity.
Although, it is an underdiagnosed entity, its prevalence
may be as high as 23.4% in school-going children with boys
affected more than girls. The causes may be benign vocal cord
lesions, infections, inflammations, congenital, neurological, or
traumatic.
It may impair quality of life in regards to speech. Children
with vocal nodules, vocal fold paralysis and paradoxical vocal
cord movements had statistically significant pediatric voicerelated quality-of-life-impairments as compared to their age
matched normal counterparts as per study conducted in 2008
by Merati et al. This requires a more aggressive evaluation and
required intervention of dysphonia in pediatric ages.

Vocal Nodules
Vocal nodules are by far the most common pathology causing
hoarseness in childhood with an incidence of 38–78%, which
causes abnormality in vibratory function of cords with
decreased mucosal waves on stroboscopic examinations.
The prevalence of vocal fold nodules varies affecting 21.6%
in males and 11.7% in females. Vocal nodules are usually
bilateral and formed at the junction of anterior and mid third
of vocal cords. Vocal nodule arises due to the mechanical
trauma, injury and with secondary hyalinization at the free
edge of vocal cords (Fig. 1).

Clinical Pearls
• Hoarseness in children, with vocal abuse, is commonly due to
vocal nodules
• It is very important to examine the larynx, even in children, to
know the exact pathology.

ETIOLOGY
Vocal abuse plays a major role causing hoarseness in pediatric
age group. It is more commonly observed in boys, in view of
more aggressive nature as compared to girls.
The etiology of hoarseness may be:
• Benign vocal cord lesions like vocal nodule, polyp
• Vocal cord cysts, sulcus vocalis
• Juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis
• Vocal fold paresis
• Laryngopharyngeal reflux
• Acute or chronic laryngitis
• Foreign body inhalation
• Malignant lesions of larynx
• Systemic illness like hypothyroidism
• Post-surgery (Iatrogenic)

Fig. 1: Five-year-old child with hoarseness and cystic swelling free

CHAPTER 146: Hoarseness in Pediatric Age Group

Vocal Polyps

Juvenile Laryngeal Papillomatosis

Vocal polyps are less infrequent entity, usually unilateral,
may be pedunculated or sessile. Polyps are formed due to
phonotrauma and occur at the site of exertion of maximum
muscular and aerodynamic force. These are formed as a result
of circulation impediment, thrombosis, exudation, edema due
to inflammation of the vocal cords.

Juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis (recurrent respiratory
papillomatosis) is a benign infectious condition of larynx
due to human papilloma virus infection of serotype mainly
6 and 11. It is the most common benign neoplasm of larynx
and second most common cause of dysphonia or hoarseness
in children. It is more aggressive in childhood, often
requiring multiple surgical intervention. Most common age
of presentation is from 2 to 4 years, with youngest reported
age is at 1 day. It has an incidence of 4.3 per 100,000 among
the children with an equal male and female distribution.
It usually presents as dysphonia in early stage of disease,
but may be presented with breathing difficulty and stridor
when compromises the glottic airway and may require
tracheotomy. The most common sites involved in larynx are
midzone of the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, the upper
and lower margins of the ventricle, the undersurface of the
vocal folds, the carina with a common histologic feature of a
squamociliary junction sites (Fig. 4).

Vocal Cord Cysts
Vocal cord cysts usually present as unilateral submucosal
swelling with reduced mucosal waves on stroboscopy (Fig. 2).

Sulcus Vocalis
It has epithelium invaginates and adheres to vocal ligament
forming a longitudinal furrow with incomplete vocal cord
closure on stroboscopy. Both are believed to be either
congenital or may be acquired lesions having variable
presentations of hoarseness, vocal fatigue or voice breakage.
They have a poor response to speech therapy and may require
surgical intervention (Fig. 3).

Congenital or Acquired Vocal Fold Paresis
In children it may present as dysphonia, resulting from birth
trauma or congenital anomaly involving the central nervous
system. Vocal fold paralysis may have a unilateral or bilateral
vocal cord involvement and should be differentiated from
cricoarytenoid joint dislocation. Unilateral vocal fold paresis
may remain undiagnosed, but bilateral vocal fold paresis
may present with stridor, requiring tracheostomy. It may have
spontaneous recovery, otherwise may need corrective surgical
intervention later on.

Laryngopharyngeal Reflux
It can present as hoarseness, which is more aggressively being
evaluated in recent era. Although confirming the diagnosis is
difficult, reflux laryngitis with dysphonia may be reversible
with antireflux proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic drug
treatment.

705
Fig. 3: Sulcus vocalis

Fig. 4: Juvenile papilloma (endoscopic view)

SECTION 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat

Acute or Chronic Laryngitis
It may present as dysphonia causing vocal fold edema.
Although it has a viral etiology, may be bacterial or fungal also.
Symptoms may worsen more with vocal abuse. It should be
differentiated from acute laryngotracheobronchitis or croup,
caused by parainfluenza virus I and II.

Foreign Body Inhalation
It can cause hoarseness of acute onset with or without breathing
difficulty. On evaluation patient may have stridor along with
change in voice, which may need immediate intervention.

Malignant Tumors
Malignant tumors of larynx although rare, but should be
ruled out in a pediatric patient presented with progressively
worsening hoarseness with dysphagia or breathing difficulty.
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common variant,
others are squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, muco­
epidermoid carcinoma or metastatic carcinoma variant. Long
standing recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is known risk
factor in the development of malignant transformation with an
incidence of 2–3%.

Iatrogenic
patient may present with change in voice following surgery.
It may be due to vocal fold paresis following cardiothoracic
surgery or may be due to cricoarytenoid dislocation.

Clinical Pearl
• Laryngopharyngeal reflux, despite being common, in children
is still an underdiagnosed entity
• Neonates and infant with unilateral cord paralysis have a weak
cry whereas bilateral vocal cord paralysis presents with stridor.

threatening condition. Stridor may be inspiratory, expiratory or
biphasic, depending upon the site of involvement in the larynx.
The etiology may be laryngeal papillomatosis or neoplastic
lesion.
Difficulty in swallowing may be associated, when laryngeal
involvement because of neurologic disorder or large structural
abnormality that hampers the swallowing physiology. It may be
associated with aspiration, especially in cases of neurological
disorders and laryngeal clefts.
Significant gastroesophageal reflux may present as
hoarseness, but it is a difficulty entity to diagnose or ruled out
reflux. Some physicians prefer an antireflux trial response for
the diagnosis of the entity.

Examination
It includes thorough otolaryngological examination,
examination of endolarynx and voice analysis. Endolarynx is
examined using 90 degree telescope or fiberoptic 2.7 or 4.0 mm
laryngoscope. This provides information regarding structural
vocal cord abnormality and its functional aspects also.
Although awake laryngoscopy is superior to laryngoscopic
evaluation under general anesthesia, in infants for proper
evaluation some surgeon prefer evaluation under anesthesia
without muscle relaxant. Video stroboscopic examination
provides better clinical details regarding the detail mucosal
vibratory function (Fig. 5).
Subjective evaluation with pediatric voice handicap index
(pVHI) and objective voice evaluation with acoustic and
aerodynamic analysis plays an important role in evaluation
and examining response to treatment.

Clinical Pearl
• With patience, counseling, and parental cooperation good
examination of larynx are possible in most cases either by
indirect laryngoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy
• Direct laryngoscopy for examination under anesthesia, without
muscle relaxant, is required only in select few.

EVALUATION
Approach to a child with hoarseness needs a multidisciplinary
approach involving otolaryngologist, speech language
therapist for detailed evaluation of medical history, physical
examinations, laryngoscopic vocal cord assessment and
acoustic and aerodynamic evaluation of voice with strobo­
scopic examination if needed.

History

706

Patient should be thoroughly studied regarding the age
of onset, i.e., since birth or later, duration of hoarseness.
Congenital lesions usually present at birth, whereas
neurological illnesses may present from birth or later on. It
may be intermittent as in reflux laryngitis or vocal abuse or
persistent as in structural laryngeal pathology. Progressively
worsening dysphonia may be because of neoplastic lesions
and juvenile papillomatosis.
When associated with noisy breathing, it should be
evaluated seriously; otherwise it may progress in to a life

ALGORITHM 1

URTI, upper respiratory tract infection; PND, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, PPI, proton pump inhibitor, RRP, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, MLS,
microlaryngeal surgery; CECT, contrast-enhanced computed tomography.

Additional test laryngeal electromyography, pH probing
may be done when there is any clinical suspicion and
requirement.

TREATMENT
Voice therapy: Usually it is the initial and most common form
of treatment used in treatment of dysphonia in pediatric age
group. Voice therapy for children is usually behavioral in
nature and includes family orientation, vocal hygiene and
vocal training. In children specific voice therapy techniques
are associated with drawing, body movements, and hand
gestures to make them understand the goals of therapy.
Computer games and software’s like the voice therapy
segment in Doctor’s Speech etc. especially designed to
provide visual and audio feedbacks related to respiration,
voice quality, pitch, loudness, resonance, and articulation are
used to make voice therapy for children more interesting and
concrete.
General voice therapy techniques include body relaxation,
breathing exercises, laryngeal manipulation, and repositioning
in the neck. Whereas the specific techniques include resonance
and vibration technique, chanting of poems and rhymes
reduces the compression of laryngeal forces and increases
reverberation in oral and nasal cavities.

Clinical Pearls
• Voice therapy is mainstay of treatment for vocal nodules in
children
• It is very important to involve the family for voice therapy in
children.

Surgery
It is done in specific conditions. Vocal polyps need micro­
scopic laser or cold instrument excision while vocal nodules
respond most of the times to voice therapy. It is only vocal
nodules which do not respond to voice therapy that need
surgery. Vocal cord cysts mucus retention or epidermoid
needs surgical excision. This may be done by laser or flap
phonomicrosurgery.
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (Juvenile papillomas)
needs surgical excision. Nowadays a combination of debrider
debulking using a skimmer blade and CO2 laser is used for
removal of juvenile papillomas. Papillomas can recur and need
multiple surgical sittings.
Bilateral abductor cord paralysis may need surgical inter­
vention if stridor is severe. The commonly done procedures are
posterior laser cordectomy, Kashima procedure (disjunction
of vocal process from the vocal cord) and endoscopic laser
arytenoidectomy.

707

SECTION 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat
Unilateral cord paralysis not responding to voice therapy
may need injection or medialization thyroplasty.

Clinical Pearls
• Removal of vocal nodule without a good and adequate
speech therapy is not advisable. Surgery reserved only for rare
refractory cases
• Repeated frequent removal of juvenile onset recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis is required to prevent airway
obstruction and tracheotomy
• The aim of surgery in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is to
provide adequate airway, functional voice with minimal scarring.

Otitis Media with Effusion
Anurag M Srivastava, Anil K Monga, Uday Monga

INTRODUCTION
Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the chronic accu­mulation
of mucus within the middle ear and sometimes the mastoid
air cell system. It is characterized by a nonpurulent effusion
of middle ear that may be either mucoid or serous. Symptoms
usually involve hearing loss or aural fullness but typically
do not involve pain or fever. Otitis media with effusion can
occur during the resolution of acute otitis media once the
inflammation has resolved. Middle ear infections are most
common medical problem in infants and children of pre­
school age. Tympanostomy tube insertion is preferred initial
procedure. Adenoidectomy should not be performed, unless
a distinct indication exists (e.g., nasal obstruction, chronic
adenoiditis). Medical Therapy to manage the mucosal aspect of
the disease will be required regardless of surgical intervention.
The otolaryngologist should monitor patients until the
conditions resolves with medical or surgical intervention.
Thereafter, if the patient’s hearing is normal, the paediatrician
can provide care.

DEFINITION
Otitis media with effusion is the chronic accumulation of
mucus within the middle ear and sometimes the mastoid air
cell system. The time that the fluid has to be present for the
condition to be chronic is usually taken as 12 weeks.

SYNONYMS
Serous otitis media is also known as nonsuppurative otitis
media, exudative otitis media or simply “glue ear”. Other terms
are serous otitis media, secretory otitis media and chronic nonpurulent otitis media (Table 1).

SUBJECTIVE COMPLAINTS
Otitis media with effusion is characterized by a non-purulent
effusion of the middle ear that may be either mucoid or serous.
Symptoms usually involve hearing loss or aural fullness but
typically do not involve pain or fever. In children, hearing loss
is generally mild and is often detected only with an audiogram.
In many children, OME may be preceded by an episode
of acute otitis media (AOM) with otalgia and fever. These
secretions then become secondarily infected with bacteria—
AOM. Once the infection has resolved, it takes time for the
epithelium to recover. So, OME will be present temporarily in
many children after an episode of AOM.

CLINICAL AND FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY
Middle ear cleft is a continuous space that extends from
the nasopharyngeal orifice of the eustachian tube to the
furthermost mastoid air cells. Three main segments are the
eustachian tube; middle ear (tympanum); and the air cells of

SECTION 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat

Classic Theory
The classic explanation proposes that eustachian tube
dysfunction is the necessary precursor. If eustachian tube
dysfunction is persistent, a negative pressure develops within
the middle ear from the absorption and/or diffusion of nitrogen
and oxygen into the middle ear mucosal cells. If present for
long enough and with appropriate magnitude, the negative
pressure elicits a transudate from the mucosa, leading to the
eventual accumulation of a serous, essentially sterile effusion.

Newer Theories

Fig. 1: Anatomy of the external and middle ear

the mastoid, petrosa, and related areas. Tympanic membrane
facilitates sound transfer also allow it to serve as a clinical
window into the middle ear cleft, one that permits inferences
about the condition of the tympanum based on visible changes
in the color, mobility, or position (Fig. 1).
Mucosal lining of the middle ear cleft varies from the thick,
ciliated, respiratory epithelium of the eustachian tube and
anterior tympanum to the thin, relatively featureless cuboidal
epithelium in the mastoid cells.

OBJECTIVE FINDINGS
Otoscopic findings of inflammation in AOM may include
decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane that is
manifested by difficulty in assessing the ossicular landmarks,
yellowness and/or redness with hypervascularity, purulent
middle ear effusion (MEE), and, occasionally, bullae. This
appearance clearly contrasts with that of OME.
Findings that suggest the presence of OME include
observable air-fluid levels (which may be vertically oriented),
serous middle ear fluid, and a translucent membrane with
diminished mobility.
Otitis media with effusion can also be associated with
negative pressure in the middle ear. This negative pressure is
suggested by the prominence of the lateral process, a more
horizontal orientation of the malleus, and movement only with
negative pneumatoscopy.
Occasionally, tonsillar hypertrophy can accompany
findings of OME. More commonly, adenoid hypertrophy is
present. Additional findings may include turbinate bogginess,
postnasal drip, rhinorrhea, and watery and/or erythematous
eyes consistent with a concurrent upper respiratory tract
infection (URTI) or environmental allergies.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

710

Otitis media with effusion can occur during the resolution
of AOM once the acute inflammation has resolved. Among
children who have had an episode of AOM, as many as 45%
have persistent effusion after 1 month, but this number
decreases to 10% after 3 months.

The newer models describe the primary event as infla­mmation
of the middle ear mucosa caused by a reaction to bacteria
already present in the middle ear. Indeed, Bluestone and others
have shown (using radiographic evidence) that reflux up the
eustachian tube is demonstrable in children prone to otitis
media. Furthermore, Crapko et al. demonstrated the presence
of pepsin in the middle ear space of 60% of children with
OME. This reflux certainly may also occur in otherwise healthy
individuals. Yilmaz et al. published a study that documented
significant changes in oxidative stress in patients with OME.
The investigators demonstrated a significantly improved but
not normalized level of oxidants following the placement of
ventilation tubes.

ETIOLOGY

Clinical Pearl
• OME and AOM—still one of the most researched area in otology.

Same flora found in AOM can be isolated in OME. With OME,
the inflammatory process has clearly resolved, and the volume
of bacteria has decreased. However, because of the similarity
of these two conditions, reviewing the pathogenic organisms
in AOM is worthwhile.

Common Pathogens
The most common bacteria in AOM, in order of frequency, are:
• Streptococcus pneumoniae is found in 35% of cases, and the
prevalence does not seem to vary with age; the serotypes
most commonly isolated, in order of frequency, are 19, 23,
6, 14, and 3
• Haemophilus influenzae is found in 20% of cases; of these
cases, 25–45% involve beta-lactamase production, with a
clear trend of increasing resistance
• Moraxella catarrhalis is found in 4–13% of cases of AOM,
with a great frequency in winter and autumn; of these
cases, 70–100% involve beta-lactamase production.
Additional bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus
pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative enteric
bacteria, and anaerobes. When an effusion is present for longer
than 3 months, Pseudomonas species predominate.
In other more recent studies, viruses have been isolated
in conjunction with bacteria in 15–20% of cases of AOM.

CHAPTER 147: Otitis Media with Effusion
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus were the
most frequent.
The primary difference with the pathogens in OME
compared with AOM is that the frequency of S. pneumoniae
is not as high, and H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis are
moderately more common.
• Allergy has long been recognized as one of the causative
factors of OME. Nasotubal mucosal congestion associated
with inhalant allergy and obstruction of the ET was
mentioned earlier. A significant association has been
reported between food allergy and serous otitis media
(SOM) and recurrent AOM is more prevalent among
children suffering from immunodeficiency.
Some other causes are multiple: Young age, bottle feeding,
crowded living conditions (including day-care centers),
heredity, and a variety of associated conditions including cleft
palate, immunodeficiency, ciliary dyskinesia, Down syndrome
and cystic fibrosis. The genetic factors of otitis media have yet
to be delineated (Table 2).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Otoscopic findings of inflammation in AOM may include
decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane (which has
a bulging contour) manifested by difficulty in assessing
the ossicular landmarks, yellowness and/or redness with
hypervascularity, purulent MEE, and, occasionally, bullae.
This appearance clearly contrasts with that of OME.
Findings that suggest the presence of OME are observable
air-fluid levels (which may be vertically oriented), serous
middle ear fluid, and a translucent membrane with diminished
mobility. Extensive inflammation and purulent MEE should
not be evident.
Occasionally, tonsillar hypertrophy can accompany findings
of OME. More commonly, adenoid hypertrophy is present,
especially in patients with prolonged or recurrent condi­
tion. Other findings are turbinate bogginess, postnasal drip,
rhinorrhea, and watery and/or erythematous eyes consistent
with a concurrent URTI or environmental allergies (Fig. 2).

DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Middle ear infections are the most common medical problem
in infants and children of preschool age.
Clinical guidelines from a joint commission of specialties
document that screening surveys of healthy children between
infancy and age 5 years show 15–40% point prevalence in
MEE. Furthermore, among children examined at regular
intervals for 1 year, 50–60% of child care attendees and 25%
of school-aged children were found to have an MEE at some
point during the examination period, with peak incidence
during the winter months.
Between 84% and 93% of all children experience at least 1
episode of AOM. Furthermore, approximately 80% of children
have had an episode of OME when younger than 10 years. The
prevalence of OME is highest in those aged 2 years or younger,
and it sharply declines in children older than 6 years.
Otitis media is more frequent in the winter months
regardless of climate, presumably due to crowding in
schools during the upper respiratory infection (URI) season.
Henderson et al. (1982) confirmed the chronologic proximity of
otitis media to URI in a day-care setting, which held regardless
of time of year.

In adults, recognizing unilateral otitis media (OME) with
effusion is crucial. It must be considered a nasopharyngeal
mass until definitively proven otherwise. Indirect mirror exami­
nation or flexible nasopharyngoscopy should be performed.
Imaging studies and possibly even biopsies may be indicated.
Other neglected areas include:
• Failure to note hearing loss
• Failure to recognize a delay in language development in
children.
The following are conditions that should be considered
when evaluating patients with suspected OME:
• Benign nasopharyngeal masses
• Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

Assessment
Laboratory tests have rarely been used:
• History taking and physical examination are sensitive
and specific enough to facilitate accurate diagnosis and
treatment of the disease
• Obtaining cultures is not routine for this condition but is in
tympanocentesis
• Complete blood cell (CBC) count is assessed to rule out
active infection.

Radiologic Studies
Plain radiography of the nasopharynx is needed to identify
enlarged adenoids.

Computed Tomography
Computed tomography (CT) scanning is extremely sensitive
but done only in rare situations.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) useful in the workup for
soft-tissue masses.

Pneumatic Otoscopy
American clinical practice guidelines have strongly advocated
the use of pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic
method for OME. The sensitivity of pneumatic otoscopy is 85–
93% and its specificity from 71% to 89%. This can be carried out
with a closed system in a handheld otoscope or with a Siegle’s
pneumatic speculum, viewed with headlight illumination or
microscope. Acceptable to most children, the inability to gain
a seal with the available speculum can occur in up to 20% of
children aged over 18 months.

Video Otoscopy

712

Video recordings of otoscopy, including pneumatic otoscopy,
can be documented and used to monitor changes with time. It
can also be used for teaching and research purposes.

Free-field Testing
In primary care, audiometry is seldom available, particularly for
younger children. Under these circumstances, the practitioner
could perform free-field voice testing of hearing.

Tympanometry
Tympanometry is perhaps the most useful of all tests in
association with OME. This test reveals a type B result in 43% of
cases of OME and a type C result in 47% of cases.
Though an acoustic seal is sometimes difficult to achieve,
bilateral tympanograms should be obtainable in the majority
(98%) of children between the ages of 3.5 and 7 years, in a
slightly lower percentage (90–94%) of infants 2–11 months of
age and 78–88% of infants 12–24 months of age are included.
According to American Academy of Family Physicians
(AAFP), the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head
and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), and the American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) subcommittee on OME, audiology is a
necessary component of the evaluation of certain patients with
this condition.
The committee not only stated that initial hearing testing
can be done in a primary care setting for children aged 4 years
or older, but it also stated that conventional audiometry with
earphones is performed with a fail criterion of more than
20 dB HL at 1 or more frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz)
in either ear.

Language Testing
Language testing has also been advised for children with
hearing loss (pure tone average greater than 20 dB HL on
comprehensive audiometric evaluation). Testing for language
delays is important, because communication is integral to all
aspects of human functioning (Box 1).

Tympanocentesis and Myringotomy
Tympanocentesis involves aspiration of effusion from the
middle ear. Tympanocentesis can serve as both a therapeutic
procedure and a diagnostic procedure.
The criterion for documentation of an MEE is myringotomy,
which has the advantage of increased exposure and better
suctioning relative to tympanocentesis. Only disadvantage

is a larger incision with a greater, although small, chance of
persistent perforation or otorrhea.

OVERVIEW OF MEDICAL AND
SURGICAL APPROACHES

Clinical Pearls
• Modification of risk factors is also a form of definitive
management
• Reasonable primary intervention
• Avoidance of passive smoking
• Breastfeeding is associated with a lower incidence of otitis
media
• No feeding in supine position
• Avoidance of exposure to large number of children
• Avoidance of Allergens.

Summary of Medical Intervention
The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the
American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
(AAO-HNS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
subcommittee on OME published clinical guidelines for OME:
• Document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence
and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of
the child with OME
• Distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech,
language or learning problems from other children with
this condition, and more promptly evaluate hearing,
speech, language and need for intervention in children at
risk
• Manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful
waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if
known), or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown)
• Hearing testing should be conducted when OME persists
for 3 months or longer, or at any time that language delay,
learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected
in a child with OME
• Children with persistent OME who are not at risk should
be reexamined at 3–6 month intervals until the effusion is
no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or
structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are
suspected.

Autoinflation
Many studies have reported mixed results when attempting
to determine if autoinflation, compared with no intervention,
improves effusion clearance rates. However, it is not routinely
practiced.

Summary of Surgical Intervention
The following is a verbatim summary of the AAFP, AAO-HNS,
and AAP clinical guideline recommendations:
• When a child becomes a surgical candidate, tympano­
stomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure

•
•
•

Adenoidectomy should not be performed, unless a
distinct indication exists (e.g., nasal obstruction, chronic
adenoiditis)
Repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringo­
tomy, with or without tube insertion
Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be
used to treat OME.

Medication
Pharmacologic management of OME includes adminis­
tration of antimicrobial agents, steroids, antihistamines and
decongestants, and mucolytics.

Antimicrobial Agents
Otitis media with effusion demonstrates viable pathogenic
bacteria, treatment with appropriate antibiotics is reasonable,
albeit with evidence showing only short-term benefit.
Commonly used drugs are erythromycin, sulfisoxazole,
amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.

Steroids
Empirical evidence indicates that steroids help in improvement
of OME in cases resistant to 2 weeks of antibiotics. It may be
beneficial to add intranasal steroids.

Antihistamines and Decongestants
Nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and sinusitis often accompany
otitis media, and antihistamines and decongestants may be
considered for the relief of these associated symptoms.

Mucolytics
Used in antibiotic resistant cases.

Indications for Surgical Intervention
Surgical intervention is indicated in cases of developmental
delays, particularly in the areas of speech and language
development.
Children who need aggressive intervention include any of
the following:
• Children with permanent hearing loss independent of
OME
• Those with suspected or diagnosed speech and language
delay or disorder
• Those with autism spectrum disorder or other pervasive
developmental disorders
• Children with syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome) or
craniofacial disorders that include cognitive, speech and
language delays
• Those who are blind or have uncorrectable visual
impairment
• Children with cleft palate, with or without an associated
syndrome
• Children with developmental delay.

SECTION 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat

MYRINGOTOMY
This section will briefly review myringotomy and aspiration
of effusion and myringotomy with pressure equalization tube
(PET) insertion.

Myringotomy and Ventilation Tubes
Introduced in 1954 by Armstrong, ventilation tube insertion
has become the criterion standard and most common therapy
for chronic otitis media with effusion (COME). Improved
hearing and decreased rates of AOM are absolute benefits of
myringotomy with placement of ventilation tubes; these have
been documented multiple times. Typically, the tubes selfextrude 9–12 months after placement.
Pressure equalization tubes are available in a variety of sizes,
shapes and materials. All are designed to permit ventilation of
the middle ear and mastoid system. Prolonged aeration of the
middle ear has been shown to reverse the mucosal hyperplasia
and metaplasia that accompany OME.
Fig. 3: Showing a tympanic membrane with grommet in situ

Complications
Overall complication rate of ventilation tubes are 11%.
• Persistent otorrhea is the most common complication,
occurring in 15% of patients and persisting as long as 1 year
in 5%
• Second in frequency is tympanosclerosis, which is not
clinically significant unless it is extensive
• Persistent perforation is seen in approximate 2%
cases, where it is in place longer than 18 months. This
complication is also known to increase with the placement
of tympanostomy tubes (T-tubes) that are designed to
stay in the tympanic membrane longer than the typical
grommet tube
• Other lesser known complications are granulation tissue
formation, cholesteatoma and sensorineural hearing loss.
Clinical guidelines summarize a number of studies and
state that tympanostomy tubes are recommended for initial
surgery, because randomized trials show a mean 62% relative
decrease in effusion prevalence and an absolute decrease of
128 effusion days per child during the next year. Hearing levels
improve by a mean of 6-12 dB while the tubes remain patent
(Table 4) (Fig. 3).

Adenoidectomy

Removal because of Enlargement
Enlarged adenoids occlude the nasopharynx and choanae. This
potentiates eustachian tube reflux. However, multiple studies
have revealed that the result of adenoidectomy is independent
of adenoid size. This finding suggests that processes other than
simple adenoid mass are involved.

Removal for Improvement of
Eustachian Tube Function
Improvement in the equilibration of positive middle ear
pressure after adenoidectomy has been documented. In
addition, extremely large adenoids may physically occlude
the eustachian tube orifice, although Bluestone and others
have shown that this is rare. The obstruction is nearly always
functional.

Although adenoidectomy was once the principal treatment for
OME, easy and low-risk placement of PETs is now favored.

Removal of a Potential Source of Inflammation
and Infection at the Eustachian Tube Orifice

TABLE 4: Otitis media with effusion duration and tympanostomy
tube

The third and most recent rationale for adenoidectomy
is to remove a potential inflammatory source and the
presence of infection at the orifice of the eustachian tube.
When performed correctly, adenoidectomy can be used to
create a smooth nasopharyngeal mucosa, which decreases
the colonization of bacteria that can occur in the crypts of
adenoid tissue.
Complications of adenoidectomy include bleeding (0.4%),
velopalatal insufficiency (usually temporary), and a patulous
eustachian tube.

ALGORITHM 1
Management of otitis media with effusion

*Gentle suction cleaning

Long-term Monitoring
No standard of care for the follow-up of patients with OME has
been established.
Most ventilation tubes stay in situ for 6–9 months and
are extruded naturally through ear canal. Patient should be
followed after 3 weeks after the placement of the tubes and
then every 6 months thereafter, until the tubes extrude or are
removed.
Patients are instructed that if more than two episodes of
otorrhea occur before the 6-month follow-up is scheduled,
they should see their otolaryngologist (ENT) instead of or in
addition to their primary care physician (PCP)/pediatrician.
We recommend the removal of ventilation tubes that have
not spontaneously extruded between 18 and 24 months after
placement due to the increasing risk of persistent tympanic
membrane perforation.
The otolaryngologist should monitor patients until the
conditions resolves with medical or surgical intervention.
Thereafter, if the patient’s hearing is normal, the primary
physician/pediatrician can provide care. If a documented
hearing loss is present, it should be reevaluated for severity and
type of management.
A multidisciplinary team should rigorously follow and
aggressively treat language-related developmental delays.
Interventions should include the use of hearing aids, if
justified.

Clinical Pearls
To treat or not to treat, that is the question
• Significant associated conductive hearing loss
• Occurrence in young infants, as they are unable to communicate
about their symptoms and may have suppurative disease
• An associated acute suppurative URTI
• Concurrent permanent conductive/sensorineural hearing loss
• Presence of speech/language delay associated with effusion
and hearing loss
• Tinnitus, vertigo or disequilibrium
• Alterations of tympanic membrane, such as a retraction pocket
• Middle-ear changes, such as adhesive otitis media or ossicular
involvement
• Previous surgery for otitis media (e.g., tympanostomy tube
placement or adenoidectomy)
• When episodes of acute otitis media recur frequently (5–6
episodes/year)
• Effusion that persists for 3 months or longer (i.e. chronic otitis
media with effusion, before consideration for tympanostomy
tube placement)
• Difficult as it is each patient has to be taken up for surgery
at his own merit considering a holistic global understanding
of the extent of the problem, the effect on quality of life and
above all possibility of sequelae and complications in later life.

SECTION 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat

PITFALLS
Thorough investigations required for persistence of OME as in
children with craniofacial abnormalities.
Medical Therapy to manage the mucosal aspect of the
disease will be required regardless of surgical intervention.
Limitations of surgical management of tube placement, i.e.,
persistent otorrhea, tympanosclerosis, persistent perforation
(2%), others—focal atrophy, granulation tissue formation,
cholesteatoma, and SNHL.

Pediatric Sinusitis
Devinder Rai

Introduction
The paranasal sinuses in childhood are difficult to evaluate
because of the variability in size, shape, and patterns of
development. However, the child’s sinuses are affected by a wide
spectrum of conditions including congenital abnormalities,
inflammatory, traumatic and neoplastic conditions.
At birth, both the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present;
however, they are diminutive in size. Thus, they may appear to
be opacified in infants in good health. As sinus development
proceeds, opacification or mucous membrane thickening
continues to be physiological till about 6 years of age.
The sphenoid sinus is underdeveloped and nonpneumatized at birth and only starts to aerate at about 3 years
of age. The varying degrees of pneumatization of the sphenoid
sinus results in three types:
1. Conchal
2. Presellar
3. Sellar.
The last sinus to develop is the frontal sinus, which starts
appearing at the age of 6 and only completes its aeration by the
age of 15. Depending upon the extent of aeration of the frontal
recess, which is the narrow hourglass shaped doorway leading
to the frontal sinus, Kuhn divided the cells in the recess into
four types:
1. Kuhn Type 1—Single cell above an agger nasi cell
2. Kuhn Type 2—Two or more cells above and behind agger
nasi cell
3. Kuhn Type 3—Single large cell above agger nasi,
pneumatized into frontal sinus (<50% the height of frontal
sinus)
4. Kuhn Type 4—Single large cell above agger nasi,
pneumatized into frontal sinus (>50% the height of frontal
sinus).

SINUSITIS
The common predisposing events that set the stage for acute
bacterial sinusitis are acute viral upper respiratory infections

ch-148.indd 717

that result in a viral rhinosinusitis (a diffuse mucositis
that predisposes to approximately 80% of bacterial sinus
infections) and allergic inflammation (that predisposes to 20%
of bacterial sinus infections). Children have 6–8 viral upper
respiratory infections each year; it is estimated that 5–13% of
these infections may be complicated by a secondary bacterial
infection of the paranasal sinuses.
Sinusitis in children is also associated with an increased
risk of complications. The complications of sinusitis may be
divided into orbital, intracranial and local complications. The
increased risk may be attributed to the low immunity of the
children as well as the low bone density of the lamina and the
fovea ethmoidalis.

CLASSIFICATION
According to duration of sinusitis:
1. Acute Sinusitis (7 days to 4 weeks)
2. Subacute sinusitis (4–12 weeks)
3. Chronic sinusitis (persistence of symptoms beyond 3
months).
According to etiology or the causative factors:
1. Bacterial
2. Fungal; Fungal sinusitis is usually seen in children
who are immunocompromised. Thus, the cause of
immunocompromise if any should be searched for in any
child suffering from fungal sinusitis. The cause could be
uncontrolled Type 1 diabetes, children undergoing steroid
therapy, HIV infection, or those suffering from neoplastic
conditions of the blood cells
3. Allergic sinusitis without polyposis: children are inherently
prone to allergies, which is manifested as nasal discharge
and nasal obstruction leading to obstructive sleep apnea
symptoms
4. Allergic sinusitis with nasal polyposis: nasal polyposis,
being relatively common in adults is rarely seen in children.
Any child with polyposis should be further examined to
rule out ciliary dyskinesia syndromes, cystic fibrosis and
other similar diseases.

BACTERIOLOGY
The usual bacteria implicated in sinusitis are Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella
catarrhalis. Other lesser common bacteria isolated were
Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus,
Fusobacterium, and Prevotella.
In immunocompetent children the usual fungal species
responsible are Aspergillus and Candida. However, in
immunocompromised individuals, there is a greater incidence
of invasive fungal sinusitis with Rhizopus and Mucor spp.

NATURAL HISTORY
Usually, bacterial sinusitis occurs as sequelae of viral sinusitis.
Every child on an average has about 5–7 attacks of allergic
rhinitis per year. The most common causative factor is viral.
Due to viral rhinitis there is increased nasal discharge
or rhinorrhea along with nasal congestion and edema of the
nasal mucosa. Another effect of viral infection is that there is
ciliary dysfunction leading to impaired clearance of secretions
particularly in the sinuses. This leads to stasis, which over
a period of time undergoes secondary infection leading to
bacterial sinusitis along with all its signs and symptoms.
Due to the bony immaturity of the pediatric skeleton
and thin intervening septa between the eye and the ethmoid
sinuses there is an increased incidence of complications in
pediatric sinusitis.

SYMPTOMOLOGY

718

The typical symptoms of nasal obstruction, nasal discharge
and headache as seen in the adult population are rarely seen
among young children. Thus indirect signs are considered as
pointers to a possible sinusitis in infants and young children.
The diagnosis of pediatric rhinosinusitis is usually based
on a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory
investigation and radiological findings.
The first and perhaps most common clinical indicator of
sinusitis in children is similar to that of a viral upper respiratory
tract infection which is refractory to supportive therapy.
According to Lusk, it is virtually impossible to differentiate
between an upper respiratory tract infection and rhinosinusitis
during the first 7–10 days of symptomatology. Symptoms may
include:
1. Rhinorrhea which may be serous or mucopurulent
2. Nasal congestion
3. Cough
4. Low grade fever, malaise and irritability
5. Dental pain.
However, in more advanced cases, there may be highgrade fever and a profuse purulent nasal discharge. Always
this should also raise the suspicion of a nasal foreign body in
infants. Once excluded, this may be the sign of acute sinusitis.
Several warning signs point to an impending complication of
acute sinusitis like:
1. Periorbital pain and swelling

ch-148.indd 718

2. Double vision in more advanced cases leading to loss of
vision in extreme cases
3. Signs indicating intracranial involvement like meningismus
and altered sensorium.

COMPLICATIONS
There is an increased incidence of complications in pediatric
sinusitis due to the following reasons:
1. Thinner bony septa and sinus walls
2. Greater porosity of bones
3. Larger vascular foramina
4. Open suture lines.
The complications occurring in sinusitis can be divided
into orbital, intracranial or local complications. The incidence
of orbital complications is higher with about 75% of pediatric
sinusitis cases presenting with an orbital complication. This
greater incidence of orbital complications can be attributed to
the close relationship between the sinuses and the orbit, which
are separated only by a thin bone, the lamina papyracea, which
has congenital dehiscences.
Chandler et al., divided the orbital complications into five
stages:
1. Stage of preseptal cellulitis
2. Stage of orbital cellulitis
3. Stage of subperiosteal abscess
4. Stage of orbital abscess
5. Stage of cavernous sinus thrombosis.

PRESEPTAL CELLULITIS
This is the first stage of orbital complications of sinusitis.
About 30% of children with sinusitis have preseptal cellulitis
as the initial presentation. The signs include eyelid edema
and erythema. There is normal extraocular muscle movement
and normal vision. The diagnosis of preseptal cellulitis is
based upon the characteristic clinical picture and radiological
finding. The radiologic findings include diffuse thickening of
the lids and conjunctiva.
Medical therapy is usually sufficient in preseptal cellulitis
which consists of IV antibiotics, head end elevation and warm
compresses. Decongestant therapy consisting of mucolytics,
topical and systemic decongestants should be instituted to
facilitate drainage of sinuses.

ORBITAL CELLULITIS
This stage consists of post-septal infection, which is
characterized by eyelid edema and erythema. On external
examination, chemosis and proptosis may be present.
Extraocular muscle movement may or may not affect in this
stage. Vision is normal though blurring may be present due
to proptosis. There is no discrete abscess however localized
inflammation signs are positive. Radiologically there is a low
attenuation next to lamina papyracea.
Orbital cellulitis stage may be managed the same as the
stage of preseptal cellulitis. However, due to advanced stage

11/22/2016 12:11:58 PM

Chapter 148: Pediatric Sinusitis
frequent visual acuity testing and extraocular movement
testing is warranted. Surgical drainage is indicated if no
improvement or worsening of symptoms is seen after 48 hours
of medical therapy.

SUBPERIOSTEAL ABSCESS
The stage of subperiosteal abscess is characterized by pus
formation between the periorbita and the lamina papyracea.
This displaces the orbital contents downward and laterally.
On local examination there is proptosis, chemosis, and total
ophthalmoplegia. There is thus and increased risk of residual
visual sequelae. The pus may rupture through the septum and
present in the eyelids. On CT scanning there is a rim enhancing
hypodensity with mass effect adjacent to lamina.
Treatment consists of combined medical and surgical
approaches. Only medical therapy has a success rate of about
50–67%. Combined approach is successful in 95–100% of the
cases. Due to the morbidity associated with loss of eye function,
we advocate an aggressive approach consisting of surgical
drainage along with medical therapy consisting of IV antibiotics,
systemic and topical decongestants and supportive therapy.
The surgical approach depends upon the location and
extent of the abscess in question. In case of medical abscesses
and endoscopic orbital decompression is preferred. However, in
case of lateral abscesses an external ethmoidectomy via lynch
incision or a transcaruncular approach is considered best.

ORBITAL ABSCESS
Orbital abscess is characterized by pus formation within orbital
tissues. On local examination there is exaggeration of signs
seen in subperiosteal abscess. There is visual impairment,
which may range from blurring of vision to total visual loss.
Vision loss constitutes an emergency and according to studies,
the surgeon has about 100 minutes to save the vision before
the loss becomes irreversible. On CT scanning there is a rim
enhancing hypodensity within the orbital tissue, which may
extend to the intraconal region.
Orbital abscess with its ominous complication of
irreversible vision loss must be treated aggressively with
surgical drainage the primary modality of treatment in addition
to medical therapy.

CAVERNOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS
This dreaded complication of sinusitis is characterized
by formation of clots in the cavernous sinus secondary to
infection because of activation of the coagulation cascade. This
condition is associated with chemosis, exophthalmos, decrease
or loss of vision, headaches or paralysis of the cranial nerves 3,
4, 5, 6. Other common signs include signs of raised intracranial
tension and sepsis. Infection can spread to contralateral sinus
within 24–48 hours.
Clinical acuity and testing is paramount to diagnosis as
the signs and symptoms of cavernous sinus thrombosis are

ch-148.indd 719

characteristic. However, imaging used in confirming diagnosis
consists of MRI Venogram in addition to CT scan. Cerebral
angiography is invasive and not very sensitive to the diagnosis
of cavernous sinus thrombosis.
Treatment includes early diagnosis and prompt medical
therapy consisting of IV antibiotics. Drainage of sinuses to
remove the source of infection is a must and should be done
as soon as possible. The role of anticoagulants like heparin is
controversial. Heparin should be used only if diagnosis is made
within a few hours. In more delayed cases anticoagulants like
warfarin may be tried.

LOCAL COMPLICATIONS
The basic premise of sinusitis is that it is always rhinologic in
origin. The ideology being that rhinitis causes the nasal mucosa
to undergo inflammation leading to edema and blockage of
the sinus prechambers leading to accumulation of secretions
in them which undergo secondary infections leading to
sinusitis. The local complications of sinusitis are particularly
more common in children as compared to adults due to the
immature bony skeleton and incompletely closed foramina.
In an acute case there is an incidence of frontal bone
osteomyelitis, which is termed as Potts Puffy Tumor. This is
a misnomer as there is no actual tumor but a subperiosteal
collection of pus in the frontal bone usually secondary to
frontal sinusitis.
The other local complications of sinusitis in children are
mucoceles and pyoceles. Pyocele is a collection of pus within
a walled cavity usually present in the ethmoid or the sphenoid
sinus leading to a myriad of symptoms depending on the sinus
involved and its surrounding structures. A similar presentation
but when the walled cavity contains sterile fluid it is termed
as a mucocele. Sphenoidal mucoceles are considered more
dangerous due to the close proximity of the optic nerve, which
passes in the posterolateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, which
invariably gets compressed due to the mucocele leading to
visual deficits. According to various studies once the optic
nerve gets involved or compressed, the surgeon has about 60
minutes to decompress the nerve in order to save its function
before irreversible functional deficits occur, leading to the
concept of the “golden hour”.

INTRACRANIAL COMPLICATIONS
Due to the bony immaturity, thin fovea ethmoidalis and
numerous foramina that remain open in children till full
ossification takes place there is an increased incidence of
intracranial complications as compared to adults. The signs
and symptoms that the children present with are also subtle,
thus a high degree of suspicion is needed to diagnose the
intracranial complications.
There are five types of intracranial complications of
sinusitis in children:
1. Meningitis
2. Epidural abscess

719

11/22/2016 12:11:58 PM

Section 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat
3. Subdural abscess
4. Brain abscess
5. Cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis.
These complications can also be considered as a spectrum
of progression of disease. Thus the symptoms can be quite
overlapping and confusion to the surgeon and the final
diagnosis is often made radiologically. The common symptoms
include general symptoms like fever, irritability, vomiting,
seizures, and altered sensorium. Specific symptoms include
hemiparesis, visual disturbances and other neurological
deficits. Thus ruling out sinusitis is an important part of
working up a child with such symptoms even with no preceding
complaints of nasal discharge or obstruction.
The most common microorganisms isolated in children
include S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, Gram-negative rods, and
anaerobes.
Meningitis: Acute bacterial meningitis follows sinusitis and
presents with all the general malaise symptoms in the child.
In addition the child may have neck rigidity on examination
and photophobia. The child may also present with cranial
nerve palsies. Upon examination, the various tests done are
the Kernig’s sign and Brudzinki’s sign. Radiologically there
may be enhancement along the meninges but with no abscess
formation.

EPIDURAL AND SUBDURAL ABSCESS
Due to the usual ambiguity between the two types of abscesses,
which are close to one another, they may be considered
together. They present with fever with chills and rigors,
headache and vomiting. Due to raised intracranial tension
there may be features of papilledema upon fundoscopic
examination. Epidural and subdural abscess are differentiated
from one another radiologically. Epidural abscess presents
with a rim shaped enhancement on CT scanning, whereas
subdural abscess presents with biconvex or crescentic
enhancing lesions. Subdural abscess also have a higher rate of
residual neurological sequelae, which are present in 35–55% of
the cases.

INTRACEREBRAL ABSCESS
In the present antibiotic era, brain abscesses have become
extremely rare. However, if present they present the surgeon
as an emergency with symptoms of altered sensorium, focal
neurological deficits, seizures, and papilledema. There is also a
grave prognosis as there is a 20–30% risk of mortality associated
with it. On CT scanning there is hypodense lesion in the brain,
usually in the frontal or temporoparietal lobe with peripheral
rim enhancement.

DIAGNOSIS
720

A high clinical suspicion and rapid diagnosis is a must for
pediatric sinusitis due to rapid progression of infection. A
detailed history and clinical examination including anterior

ch-148.indd 720

rhinoscopy is a must in every case. Flexible fibreoptic
nasendoscopy is an invaluable tool in order to better assess
the nasal cavity and the sinus prechambers. Laboratory
investigations include nasal smears for bacteriology, blood
work for leukocytosis, culture and for diagnosis of sepsis. The
gold standard for the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis
is the recovery of bacteria in high density (≥104 colonyforming units/mL) from the cavity of a paranasal sinus. Blood
investigations may also rule out immunodeficiency conditions
and ciliary dyskinesia.
In children below 6 years of age with uncomplicated
sinusitis radiography is generally not indicated. However,
the American College of Radiology has taken the position
that the diagnosis of acute uncomplicated sinusitis should be
made on clinical grounds alone. They support this position
by noting that plain radiographs of the paranasal sinuses are
technically difficult to perform, particularly in very young
children. Correct positioning may be difficult to achieve
and therefore the radiographic images may overestimate
and underestimate the presence of abnormalities within the
paranasal sinuses.
CT scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for
patients in whom surgery is being considered as a management
strategy (strong recommendation based on good evidence and
strong panel consensus).
In complicated cases, radiography is invaluable in
assessing the extent of disease as well as differentiating the
type of complications present. In case of a suspected intra­
cranial complication MRI may be considered as it has greater
sensitivity and specificity as compared to a CT scan.
Lumbar puncture maybe considered to confirm the
presence of meningitis; however, an ophthalmology consult
must be sought prior to this invasive procedure to rule out
raised ICT, as it may be fatal in such cases.

TREATMENT
For the sake of discussion, treatment of pediatric sinusitis
can be divided into uncomplicated cases and cases with
complications. However, treatment strategies are aimed to
be aggressive due to the fulminant and rapid progression of
infection in children.
The mainstay of treatment of acute uncomplicated
bacterial sinusitis is antibiotics, which may be parenteral or
oral depending upon variables like severity, general condition
of the child. In all suspected cases of complications hospital
admission and IV antibiotics are a must. Supportive therapy
including systemic and topical decongestants is controversial
once sinusitis has set in. A short burst of corticosteroids
may be given in atopic children to manage the symptoms
but should be used with caution in fungal sinusitis. The
following treatment algorithm has been recommended by the
Subcommittee on Management of Sinusitis and Committee on
Quality Improvement Paediatrics in 2001.
In complicated cases of sinusitis the treatment is more
aggressive as compared and involves prompt radiography to
diagnose the complication. In cases of orbital complication,

Section 18: Ear, Nose, and Throat
prompt surgical drainage of sinuses in addition to IV antibiotics
is recommended except in Stage 1, where the role of surgery is
debatable. In Stage 3 and above surgery is a must to prevent
further complications. The norm is to do an endoscopic
drainage of the sinuses and also to do an orbital decompression
and remove the lamina papyracea.
The treatment in intracranial complications is to first
differentiate between meningitis and frank abscess formation.
This can be done by ruling out raised ICT through a retinal
fundoscopy. In case of an abscess formation, surgical drainage
is a must and should be done as early as possible. Drainage
consists of removal of pus from the abscess as well as drainage
of the paranasal sinuses. Thereafter antibiotic therapy and
supportive management should continue.
In cases of mucocele and pyoceles, surgical drainage
and decompression of the surrounding structures is the only
option as supportive therapy has no role it the management.
In cases of Sphenoidal lesions, which compress the optic
nerve decompression of the nerve, must be carried out in the
same sitting.

Clinical Pearls
• Antibiotics in all cases of sinusitis in children less than 2 years of
age or in those who have had a complication in the past
• Early recognition of warning signs a must for successful
treatment and prevention of complications
• Limited role of antihistaminics and systemic decongestants, IV
antibiotics is the mainstay of treatment
• Multidisciplinary team to successfully diagnose and treat
sinusitis and its complications
• Early radiography may remove doubt in most cases
• Prompt surgical intervention is a must in case of visual deficit
and threatening complications.

Stridor in Children
Arvind S Bais

INTRODUCTION

Clinical Pearl

It is not uncommon to come across many young anxious
parents seeking advice for their child’s problem of noisy
breathing.
It is believed that less than 10% of the new born babies have
some kind of noisy breathing and all of them do not fit into the
category of congenital laryngeal stridor.

Clinical Pearl
• It is important to know that no clinical entity as congenital
laryngeal stridor existing pathology in the upper airway and
needs evaluation.

In clinical practice, a variety of terms are frequently used to
describe the noisy breathing which are given in table 1.
It is essential to know that there are some basic differences
between the larynx of an infant and adult larynx. A proper
understanding which helps in treatment planning.
Infant larynx:
• Situated higher up in the neck close to the base of the
tongue
• The size is small
• Epiglottis is infolded
• The aryepiglottic folds are large
• The internal diameter of the larynx is small
• The mucous membrane of the larynx is loosely attached
especially in the subglottic region
• The entire cartilaginous framework of the larynx is soft.

• As the internal diameter of the infant larynx is small even
1 mm of edema in the subglottic area narrows the airway
to approximately 50% as compared to adults in whom no
significant change occurs.

The gravity of the situation is enormous in infants. The
causes of stridor can be divided into: (A) Congenital and (B)
Acquired.

•

•

Reflux laryngitis.

Laryngo-tracheal Stenosis
•
•
•

Adopt the policy of wait and watch if the symptoms are
mild. Allow the time for growth.
If severe stridor is present do tracheostomy.
Laryngo-tracheal reconstruction can be done at a later
date.

Laryngeal Atresia
•

It is usually incompatible with life.

•

Laryngeal Cysts
True congenital cysts of the larynx are extremely rare. There
is severe stridor endoscopy reveals cystic swilling completely
distorting the view of the larynx, originating from the
aryepiglottic folds. Manage by Aspiration of fluid from the cyst,
allow it to collapse and then followed by complete excision
of the cyst wall. The procedure is known as deroofing and
excision.

Laryngomalacia
It is most common condition the clinical findings are as follows:
• Type I—The epiglottis is omega shaped
• Type II—The aryepiglottic folds are foreshortened
• Type III—The arytenoids have loosely attached mucous
membrane or one may see a combination of both.

Diagnosis
Use flexible endoscope to assess the status of the larynx in
spontaneous respiration. It is a self-limiting disease. No need
for tracheostomy:
• Occasionally supraglotto
• Plasty in from of trimming of the soft tissues of the larynx
may be required
• Symptoms usually subside by 2‒3 years of age.

Clinical Pearl

ACQUIRED CAUSES
Epiglottitis
Inflammation of the supraglottic Larynx caused by H.
influenzae type B and rarely by streptococci and pneumococci.
Asses by:
• Postural inspiratory stridor
• Drooling
• Thick mucus secretion
• High temperature.
Recommended:
• Pulse oximetry
• Monitor arterial blood gas (ABGS)
• Humidification
• Oxygenation
• Tracheostomy rarely done.

Clinical Pearl

• Genetic or familial incidence does occur. Reassure the parents
regarding clinical improvement over a period of time.

• There is no evidence to show that the systemic corticosteroid
is useful yet it is widely administered by pediatricians and
otolaryngologists.

Tracheomalacia
•
•
•

The incidence ranges between 1 in 1,500 and 1 in 2,000
children. Diagnosis is by CT and MRI.
Bronchoscopy reveals flattening of the trachea anteriorly
or at the junction of middle and lower third of the trachea
use of antibiotics is recommended to prevent bronchitis.
In severe cases surgery is indicated.

Clinical Pearl
• The parents should be advice to bring their child for regular
check-up in order to minimize unnecessary usage of antibiotics
and overcome anxiety.

Laryngeal Webs

724

In the third month of gestation if the larynx fails to get
recanalized web forms. In majority of cases webs are located
anteriorly and are usually thick and complete:
• Patient presents with severe stridor

ch-149.indd 724

Immediate measure requires tracheostomy following
endoscopy.
Abalation of the web by CO2 laser.

Croup
Most common between 6 months and 5 years of age. Commonly
occurs in winter and is viral in origin.

Symptoms
•
•
•

Inspiratory stridor
Fever
Barking cough.

Diagnosis
Lateral X-ray of the neck in extended position will reveal
enlarged edematous epiglottis, called as Thumb sign or a
tapered subglottic area called “steeple sign” is seen.

Management
Always admit the child. Humidification does not give much
relief. Administer nebulized adrenaline. For moderate to severe
cases systemic or nebulized corticosteroids is recommended.

Chapter 149: Stridor in Children

Clinical Pearl
• Repeated clinical examination is most desired intervention as
the clinical condition may worsen.

Foreign Bodies in the Airways
History of aspiration of foreign bodies in most of the cases
occasionally no history of aspiration yet the child may have
violent cough, breathing difficulty, difficulty in swallowing and
inspiratory stridor.
Management:
• Ensure adequate airway
• Oxygenation in severe stridor
• Prophylactic antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids to be
given on need based cases
• Plan for quick intervention in form of pan endoscopy,
i.e., laryngoscopy bronchoscopy and in few cases
esophagoscopy is required because foreign bodies in the
upper end of esophagus is a common cause of unsuspected
partial airways obstruction
• Endoscopic procedure requires good team work between
pediatrician otolaryngologist and anesthetist
• Premedication is always by Atropine injection.
• Spontaneous anesthesia by use of nitrous oxide, oxygen
and halothane
• Rarely muscle relaxant may be given.
Instruments:
• All types of rigid pediatric laryngoscopes including
anterior commissure laryngoscope rigid broncho­scopes
with internal diameter of 2.5 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm or 6 mm
with facility for ventilation telescopes with an angle of 0, 30,
and 70 degree and all types of foreign body removal forceps
and powerful suction apparatus is a must.
• Tracheostomy tray should be kept ready one may need it
at times.

•

Proper history taking and clinical observation followed by
auscultation
Note the type of stridor
Any relationship with change of posture. Note does it gets
aggravated or stops by change of posture or while feeding
Note the duration of stridor
Is it continuous, regular or intermittent
Any change in the pattern of stridor while crying
Is there any aspiration while taking feeds
Asses the neurodevelopmental status of the infant. It is very
helpful in cases of laryngomalacia.

Clinical Pearls
• Do not classify stridor as wheeze as one may miss upper airway
obstructive pathology.
• Always look for respiratory distress, at times even slow
respiratory rate. There may be evidence of Hypoxia, Hypercarbia
and even cyanosis.

Abnormalities of the Cry
•
•
•
•

In unilateral vocal cord palsy weak cry but obstructive
airway symptoms are missing
In bilateral vocal cord palsy the cry is weak but clear
In tracheomalacia barking cough with or without stridor is
present
Absent or Muffled cry is noted in laryngeal web.

Algorithm 1
Workup of a child with stridor

Clinical Pearls
• In foreign bodies in the airway cases there is no viral prodrome.
• Always prefer to use rigid endoscopes as a flexible
bronchoscope fails to give the depth of the field.

SUBGLOTTIC HEMANGIOMA
•
•
•
•
•

May be congenital or acquired.
Large hemangioma produces inspiratory stridor.
Removal by CO2 laser.
Radiotherapy is contraindicated.
Always look for cutaneous.

HEMANGIOMA IN SUCH CASES
In all cases of stridor the essential broad principles of approach
is as follows:

Physical Signs

))
Flexible endoscopy is helpful for screening, but for removal of

Inspiratory stridor:
• Breathing is rapid
• Recession of the suprasternal and Intercostal spaces
• In drawing of the epigastric region
• Flaring of the nostrils.

Nasal Patency Test
Put a small piece of cotton in front of the baby’s nostril and
observe for to and fro movement of cotton. Less movement on
one or both sides gives an idea of nosal block. It helps in ruling
out nosal causes of noisy breathing.

Radiology
•
•
•
•

Lateral skiagram of neck in extended position is a must
CT and MRI is very helpful in cases of stenosis and
tracheomalacia
Contrast radiography is not indicated except in cases of
suspected vascular abnormalities
Chest X-ray PA and lateral view should always be done.

Key points

))
Supraglottic lesion causes inspiratory stridor while subglottic
pathology may cause biphasic stridor

))
Clinical evaluation of the patient cannot be overemphasised,
it is a must

))
Follow the principle of observation, palpation, and

foreign bodies form the airway rigid endoscopy is preferred

))
Never use jet ventilation anesthesia in cases of surgery of

multiple papilloma of the larynx because of seedling and
recurrence
))
Autogenous vaccine and acyclovir do not give any benefit in
laryngeal papilloma cases
))
If there is delay in setting up OT trolly always intubate the child
and oxygenate
))
For laryngoscopic evaluation with a rigid laryngoscope
in infants never try to lift the epiglottis with the tip of
laryngoscope as severe laryngeal spasm may occur. Just wait
for few seconds spontaneous visualization is possible because
in infants the larynx is very close to the base of the tongue
))
If foreign body such as seed of any such object has been
removed piecemeal then always do a check bronchoscopy
before discharging the patient from the hospital as a small
foreign bodies if left in the bronchus may cause serious
complications later on
))
Be careful in bronchoscopy as one may override a foreign
body and nothing may be found
))
Carina is the thinnest part of tracheobronchial tree respect
it while doing the endoscopy. A small tear may lead to
spontaneous pneumothorax
))
Never waste time in removing a foreign body especially in
demonstrating its location as it may slip deeper down and
make the whole procedure difficult and time consuming
))
Gastroesophageal reflux may play a major role in acquired
abnormalities in older children. In cases of laryngeal stenosis
be treated first.

auscultation of the chest and neck also for any tracheal thud

))
Never hesitate to consult anesthetist for proper management
of airway, i.e., intubation, oxygenation tracheostomy and for
endoscopy anesthesia
))
Monitor oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas estimation
))
Ultrasonography may be needed in vocal cord palsy
))
Prefer laryngeal intubation than tracheostomy as much as
possible

In severe cases of stridor shift the patient to OT where all
facilities for anesthesia, ventilator support, tracheostomy and
endoscopy are available

Upper Airway Obstruction and
Sleep Related Breathing Disorders
Girish Raheja

INTRODUCTION
Habitual snoring during sleep, the hallmark indicator of
increased upper airway resistance, is an extremely frequent
occurrence during childhood, with a median incidence of
about 10% among preschool and school-aged children, with
subsequent declines in frequency after 9 years of age. The
exact polysomnographic criteria that differentiate between
innocent snoring (i.e., habitual snoring that does not lead to
gas exchange abnormalities, sleep disruption and/or to any
morbid consequences), and snoring that is associated with
adverse consequences, have yet to be defined. Nevertheless,
a consensus statement has been generated, and defines a set
of empiric criteria, on the basis of which we currently estimate
that of the many children with habitual snoring; approximately
2–3% will have clinically relevant disease. Therefore, the ratio
between symptomatic habitual snoring and obstructive sleep
apnea is usually between 3:1 and 5:1.
Whenever lymphoid tissue in a child occupies a
disproportionate amount of space in the oropharyngeal
region, it causes a compromise airway. The problem can be
made more intense by associated anatomic conditions such
as craniofacial abnormalities, obesity, laryngomalacia and
conditions with diminished neuromuscular tone as in Down
syndrome and cerebral palsy.
Tonsilar adenoid hyperplasia is often associated with upper
airway obstruction in children. During daytime these children
demonstrate an altered muffled “Hot Potato” closed voice with
mouth breathing, rhinorrhea and hyponasal speech.
It is however during sleep they exhibit signs of the full
spectrum of airway obstruction. This is due to the relaxation
of the oropharyngeal relaxation leading to further obstruction.
These children may usually snore loudly with cessation of
breathing for intermittent periods with sternal retraction and
paradoxical movement of the chest. The negative physiological
outcome includes hypoxemia, hypercapnia and acidosis
which leads to arousals, awakenings and a poor quality sleep.
These children demonstrate a variety of behavioral problems

apnea

• Obstructive sleep apnea

including hyperactivity, lack of stamina, poor attention spans
and daytime sleepiness or tiredness (Box 1).
These disturbances in sleep are collectively called sleep
related breathing disorders (SRBD). One such syndrome is
called upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) where a child
with a significantly obstructive nose causes snoring, mouth
breathing without significant apneas but a significant increase
in respiratory effort related arousal giving rise to daytime
fatigue and poor performance. This is now considered akin to
mild obstructive sleep apnea (Box 2).

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Children with significant obstructive sleep apnea if not treated
may land up with cor pulmonale, right ventricular hypertrophy,
congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and edema,
failure to thrive and are at a definitive risk for permanent
neurologic damage and even death.

The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in children
is 1–4% and surprisingly up to 10% of children may present
with primary snoring. Physical examination should include
the patient’s weight, height, and body mass index. Detailed
examination should be of heart and lung, head, and neck with
special emphasis to adenoids, tonsils, mandible, and mid facial
development. Adenoid facies is perhaps the most common
observation.
Tonsil size should ideally be scaled from 1–4. Scale 1 being
mild hypertrophy and Scale 4 would compromise more than
75% of the oropharyngeal airway. The adenoid size is best
evaluated with a soft tissue lateral neck radiograph to assess
the anteroposterior dimension of the nasopharynx. However,
the correlation to the clinical symptoms is still effected by
subjectivity.
Algorithm 1
Sleep related breathing disorders

728

ch-150.indd 728

Clinical Pearl
• Evaluation of the nasopharynx is only possible with a high quality
radiograph requiring an experienced radiology technician.

The full extent of the problem can only be diagnosed with
a full night polysomnography; however, in practical life the
availability of pediatric sleep labs and the ability of the parent
to conduct the study with a small child in a new environment
is wrought with errors and therefore most clinicians find
it convenient with clinical examination to interpret signs
and symptoms as explained in literature to determine the
presence or absence of obstructive sleep apnea in children.
In a large majority this clinical decision-making is shown
to be accurate. However, it may benefit a child with severe
problems to consult with a pulmonologist and a cardiologist
to rule out the ore significant and dangerous complications of
obstructive sleep apnea.

Clinical Pearl
• Polysomnography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of
obstructive sleep apnea and disordered breathing; however, in
the absence of availability the clinician will need to relay on his
clinical judgment for management of patients presenting with
signs and symptoms as listed in the tables 1 and box 3 text.

In behavioral studies these children demonstrate a high
prevalence of altered behavior such as withdrawal, anxiety,
emotional lability, impulsivity, hyperactivity, aggressiveness,

There is some suggestion that behavioral patterns may
also be associated with reduced verbal abilities and language
scores possibly a result of hypoxemia induced dysfunction
of the frontal lobe. However, this supposition needs to be
substantiated with research in future.

ADENOID AND TONSIL SURGERY FOR
OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA
Unfortunately there are few randomized studies in the
efficacy of the tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for children
with obstructive sleep apnea. The most have concluded
that Adenotonsillectomy should be considered first line of
therapy for obstructive sleep apnea provided adenotonsillar
hyperplasia is present. Outcomes appear to improve regardless
of the measure used and show a definite improvement of

*Historical findings associated with OSAS include habitual snoring with labored breathing, observed apnea, restless sleep, daytime neurobehavioral abnormalities

component of second heart sound, and others. Note that patients may have no abnormalities on examination.

quality of life and severity of obstruction and there related size
and symptoms.

Clinical Pearls
• Tonsil size does not always correlate with severity of obstructive
sleep apnea as determined by polysomnography
• Primary care physician can assess adenoid size by ordering a soft
tissue lateral radiograph of the nasopharynx from a good center

Children with other comorbidities such as craniofacial,
neuromuscular, genetic, allergic abnormalities are at a higher
risk for persistent postoperative obstructive sleep apnea and
also at a higher risk of postoperative complication such as
respiratory embarrassment and residual airway obstruction.
Long-term follow-up shows a dramatic improvement in the
quality of life scores after adenotonsillectomy with reduction
in the number of upper respiratory episodes, and hospital
visit and admissions. A reduction in problem behaviors and

cognitive impairment was seen after adenotonsillectomy.
Studies suggested that in a majority of children enuresis
resolves or improves after the surgery.

Clinical Pearls
• Adnotonsillectomy is effective in reducing physiological,
behavioral, and cognitive sequelly in patients with adeno­
tonsillar hypertrophy and obstructive sleep apnea
• Some patients with obesity develop recurrent obstructive
sleep apnea after adenotensillectomy. The primary care
physician must emphasize weight reduction and continue to
monitor the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea
after surgery.

ADENOTONSILLECTOMY
Adenoidectomy and adenotonsillectomy remain the most
commonly performed operations in children. However, they
are also the most discussed, appreciated, denounced and
least studied procedures in the history of ENT surgery. While
the indications have changed over the decades. The essential
surgery remains the same with the advent of laser, coblation,
high frequency diathermy, etc. The intraoperative bleeding has
reduced dramatically; however, the traditional surgery with
blunt dissection and snare still seems to have a large number
of favorable references.
Adenoidectomy however has become more effective and
definitive with the introduction of nasal endoscopy coupled
with powered instrumentation like shavers made by Zomed.
The operative and postoperative complications of hemorrhage
remain the most common serious problems of the surgery.
The incidence is reported from 0.2 to 0.22% from primary
hemorrhage and from 0.1 to 3% for secondary hemorrhage.
Fever in the first 36 hours is considered “normal”. It is important
to maintain hydration in hospital and immediate postoperative
period. Mortality from tonsillectomy is estimated at 1/16,000–
35,000 tonsillectomies. About one-third attribute to primary
bleeding and the majority to anesthetic mishaps.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends adeno­
tonsillectomy as the first line treatment in any child with
obstructive sleep apnea and enlargement of the tonsils and
adenoids. A lot of parents are worried about the surgery, but
it is actually quite safe and the benefits are significant. In some
kids, however, there is residual obstructive sleep apnea after
surgery. Thus, all children with obstructive sleep apnea who
have surgery need to be followed up to see if there symptoms
resolve and to make sure that they do not return. If symptoms
persist, a sleep study may be helpful. Alternative treatments are
available if sleep apnea persists. Weight loss will help in obese
kids, and allergy treatments, intranasal steroids, orthodontic
work, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can
benefit some kids.

Clinical Pearl
• There are no studies to date that demonstrate significant
negative clinical effect of tonsillectomy on the immune system.

Key points

))
Screening for snoring should be part of routine health

maintenance visits in all children; if snoring is present, a more
detailed evaluation should follow (good evidence; strong
recommendation). Note: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
is unlikely in children who do not have habitual snoring.
))
Complex, high-risk patients should be referred to a
subspecialist (good evidence for increased surgical risk in
these patients and consequent need for more complex
management; strong recommendation).
))
Patients who have cardiorespiratory failure cannot wait for
elective evaluation. These patients are not covered in the
AAP guideline because it is expected that they will be in an
intensive care setting and managed by a subspecialist.
))
The diagnostic evaluation should be thorough. The history
and physical examination have been shown to be poor in
differentiating between primary snoring and obstructive sleep
apnea syndrome (strong evidence). Polysomnography is the
diagnostic method of choice; it is the only test that quantifies
sleep and ventilatory abnormalities. Other screening tech­
niques, such as videotaping, audiotaping, nocturnal pulse
oximetry, and daytime nap polysomnography, may be
helpful if the results are positive. However, these tests have
high false-negative rates, and they do not assess the severity
of the syndrome (disease severity is useful in determining
treatment and follow-up). When the results of other diagnostic
tests are negative, polysomnography should be performed;
additional audiotaping is necessary (strong evidence; strong
recommendation).
))
In most children, adenotonsillectomy is a first-line treatment
for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; continuous positive
airway pressure is an option in patients who are not
surgical candidates or do not respond to surgical treatment
(strong evidence; strong recommendation). Note: Potential
complications of adenotonsillectomy include anestheticrelated medical problems, pain and poor oral intake in
the immediate postoperative period, and hemorrhage.
Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome may
have respiratory complications (e.g., worsening of the
syndrome, pulmonary edema); death attributable to severe

respiratory complications has been reported in patients
with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Risk factors
for complications after adenotonsillectomy in children with
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome include age younger than
3 years, cardiac complications of the syndrome (e.g., right
ventricular hypertrophy), severe obstructive sleep apnea
syndrome determined by polysomnography, failure to thrive,
obesity, prematurity, recent respiratory infection, craniofacial
anomalies, and neuromuscular disorders (the last two risk
factors are not discussed in the AAP Guideline).

Septic Arthritis
Viraj Shingade, Mandar Agashe

INTRoDUCTION
Septic arthritis continues to be one of the major causes of
orthopedic disability in pediatric population. Although
the management is not very difficult, it usually needs a
multidisciplinary approach. Most of the neonates are either
missed in diagnosis in early stages or they are managed by a
medical person single-handed and they lead to outcomes like
deformity and limb shortening. If diagnosis is made timely
and management is done by the team including neonatologist,
pediatrician, pediatric orthopedic surgeon, microbiologist,
and radiologist, most of these cases can be cured completely
without any remnant deformity or disability. This chapter gives
useful information about how to diagnose it at the earliest and
what should be the approach for the treatment.

HOW COMMON IS THE PROBLEM?
Septic arthritis refers to bacterial invasion of the joint space
and the subsequent inflammatory response.
The incidence of septic arthritis in India is approximately
1 in 1,500 live births. Although bone and joint infections are
quite common, the diagnosis of septic arthritis is not always
straightforward.

MECHANISM/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
OF THE PROBLEM
Septic arthritis usually is of hematogenous origin, but can
arise through direct inoculation. It can occur from the primary
seeding of the synovial membrane, secondarily from infection
in the adjacent metaphyseal bone or directly from infection in
the adjoining epiphysis.
When septic arthritis occurs, bacteria rapidly gain access to
the joint cavity and within a matter of hours cause synovitis and
formation of fibrinous exudates followed by areas of synovial
necrosis. Endotoxins are released. This leads to destruction of
the synovium and cartilage matrix. Proteases, peptidases, and

ch-151.indd 733

collagenases are released from the leukocytes and synovial
cells. These enzymes breakdown the cellular and extracellular
structures of the cartilage. The loss of glycosaminoglycans is
the first measurable change in articular cartilage, occurring as
early as 8 hours after bacteria are introduced into the joint. Loss
of glycosaminoglycans softens the cartilage and may cause it to
be susceptible to increased wear. Collagen destruction follows
and is responsible for visible change in cartilage appearance.
Elevation of the intracapsular pressure, thrombosis causes
impairment of the intracapsular vascular supply which causes
articular destruction. Destruction of the joint space leads to
long-term sequelae in a significant percentage of patients. In
certain joints like hip, infection distends and softens joints
capsule and may cause joint subluxation or dislocation.

WHICH ARE THE SUSCEPTIBLE
GROUPS IN NEONATES?
Septic arthritis in the neonates is seen in two distinct groups.
One is the neonate, who is sick, premature, and needs intensive
care. The other group is healthy neonate, who has been
discharged from the hospital and then presents 2–3 weeks later
with bone and joint infection.

When to Suspect (Algorithm 1)?
Clinically, septic arthritis usually presents with obvious
swelling of one or more joints. Symptoms include edema,
erythema, joint effusion, and tenderness. Patients tend to keep
the affected joint in a position that maximizes intracapsular
volume and comfort. Refusal to move an affected joint is
referred to as pseudoparalysis and even passive movement
may be painful. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, malaise,
and poor appetite, are also seen in most patients. If the
infection involves a lower extremity, the child will often have
a limp or will be unable to bear weight on the limb. A history
of antecedent trauma is quite common. Trauma rarely results
in a delayed limp. The clinician should elicit specific details

regarding any traumatic event. Did the child cry and limp or
refuse to bear weight immediately after the trauma? If the
answers to these questions are no and there was a period of
time between the injury and time symptoms appeared, the
suspicion of infection should increase.

WHICH ARE THE MOST COMMON
JOINTS INVOLVED?
Knees and the hips being most commonly affected (80%),
other commonly affected joints include the ankles, wrists,
elbows, and shoulders.

What Are Clinical Clues for Diagnosis in Neonate?
The initial presentation is with swelling of a limb or joint
and reluctance to move the limb. There may be irritability
on handling, e.g., when changing the nappies. Sometimes,
the reluctance to move a limb is so severe as to cause a
pseudoparalysis. Septic arthritis of the hip may cause the baby
to hold the leg flexed, abducted, and externally rotated.
In the fulminant form of septic arthritis, signs of bone and
joint involvement may occur at the time of, or some times after
the signs of, sepsis. The babies are lethargic with or without fever,
do not tolerate feeds, and may have abdominal distension and
jaundice. Multiple bones or joints may be involved.

What are Clinical Clues
in Infants and Older Children?
Typical symptoms like high grade fever, and warmth or hot
extremity may not be present. Limping, refusal to walk, and
refusal to bear weight may be the earliest symptom.

CHALLENGES IN
DIAGNOSING SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Many immunocompromised children fail to have fever and
may show lowered white blood cell count. X-rays may be
reported as normal in early phase of the disease. Ultrasound,
bone scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggest a
process of inflammation and effusion, but cannot diagnose
septic arthritis confirmatively in the early stage of disease.
The damage to the cartilage, growth plate, and bone due to
avascularity and enzymatic destruction sets in very early.
The cartilage destruction starts as early as 8 hours following
the onset of infection. The avascularity sets in within 24–48
hours of the tamponade. The biggest challenge is, therefore,
to control the infection and drain the joint before the damage
takes place. Understanding the limitations of investigations
for confirmation of diagnosis, it is important that physician
should have high index of suspicion and should start treatment
as earliest as possible.

Chapter 151: Septic Arthritis

WHICH ARE OTHER
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES?
It includes hemarthrosis, traumatic effusion, transient
synovitis, reactive arthritis, Lyme arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis, arthritis of acute rheumatic fever, and slipped capital
femoral epiphysis.

WHICH ARE THE MOST
COMMON CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS?
In the neonatal period, Staphylococcus aureus remains a
common organism, but Group B β-hemolytic streptococcus
and Gram-negative enteric bacilli are also frequently identified.
No bacteria are grown from the blood or joint fluid of 50% cases
of typical septic arthritis.
Other contributing organisms could be methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA), Gram-negative organisms (Entero­
bacteriaceae) fungal species like Aspergillus and Candida.
Tuberculosis and syphilis must be considered in atypical case
contexts.

WHAT INVESTIGATIONS ARE
SUPPORTIVE TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS?
The most important diagnostic test is clinical acumen. Positive
changes on X-ray suggest that the disease is already in its
advanced stage. Hence to diagnose the condition in its early
stage, optimum use of investigations like ultrasound and MRI
can be done.

Radiographs
The role of plain X-ray film in the diagnosis of early bone
and joint sepsis is often undervalued. It is because the most
sought after change is osteopenia or bone lysis, which takes
7–10 days to develop. Actually, deep soft tissue swelling with
obliteration of fat plane is the earliest radiographic evidence
of infection. Unlike older children, radiographic changes
appear early in neonatal age group. The thin periosteum
ruptures easily, and osteolytic lesions, soft tissue swelling,
and periosteal elevation are often seen within 7 days of
onset of infection. Erosion of the cortex, cavitation in the
metaphysic or epiphysis can be seen as early as 3 days of
onset of infection.

Ultrasonography
Ultrasonography (USG) is very useful to detect any joint
effusion and subperiosteal edema. Although USG cannot
clearly differentiate between pus and synovial fluid, in
experienced hands USG-guided aspiration may be very useful
to confirm the diagnosis.

Bone Scan
Bone scans are both sensitive and specific. They are often
abnormal within 2–3 days of onset of symptoms.

ch-151.indd 735

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
In selected cases, an MRI is the most sensitive. It shows changes
of marrow edema and helps to differentiate between transient
synovitis, inflammatory arthritis, and septic arthritis by virtue
of changes in marrow edema and synovial lining.

Hematological Investigations
A routine hemogram (complete blood count) with erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
are usually required and helpful to diagnose and monitor
the course of treatment. In the community setting, CRP is
useful parameter and is highly sensitive for infection. In an
immunocompromised child, it may not be very reliable.
Rather than a single value, changing trend in a CRP is more
informative.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is not very useful in
neonates, but with chronicity of infection, a decreasing trend
in ESR usually indicates subsidence of infection.
Blood culture must be routinely performed and sometimes
it can identify the pathogen. However, the blood sample must
be promptly analyzed after collection and any contamination
must be prevented.
Organism identification is extremely important for both
confirmation of the diagnosis and guiding antimicrobial
selection. Needle aspiration is likely to grow an organism in
almost 50–60% of cases whereas blood cultures yield positive
results in one-third to little more than half of specimens.

HOW TO PROCEED FOR THE MANAGEMENT
ONCE DIAGNOSIS IS MADE (Algorithm 1)?
Early diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis is usually
highly effective and usually achieves a clinically normal joint.
Consequently, it is essential that children with septic arthritis
are urgently referred to treatment centers and it is essential that
the latter centers commence treatment as soon as possible.
Prompt diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis is not only
rewarding, but also saves the child from a lifelong disability.
The treatment is a team approach which involves pedia­
trician, pediatric orthopedic surgeon, pediatric intensivist
(particularly in sick neonates), microbiologist, and radiologist.
Treatment is directed towards obtaining a rapid cure as
the sequelae of septic arthritis can be quite devastating (Figs 1
and 2). Any suspicion of the infection in a neonate should
initiate prompt investigation to identify the site and source of
the infection. Ideally, a joint or bone aspirate or positive blood
culture must be obtained before commencing antimicrobial
therapy. However, often this is not the case, and many
neonates have received oral or intravenous antibiotics before
they reach the definitive treatment center. In any case, if there
is no improvement in clinical parameters within 48–72 hours
of antimicrobial administration, then surgical intervention is
mandatory.
Prompt surgical drainage and thorough wash of the joint
is necessary. Open surgical drainage of the certain joints
is essential to prevent necrosis (e.g., head of the femur or

of proper antibiotics. Involvement of pediatric orthopedic
surgeon at the onset of treatment itself is important as he
or she is the person who is going to manage the sequelae in
future. These children need long-term follow-up.
Antimicrobial therapy should commence immediately after
drainage of pus. Antimicrobial therapy is guided by Gram stain
on the aspirated pus. Up to 50% of joint aspirates are sterile in
septic arthritis, possibly because joint fluid is bacteriostatic or
because the organisms are limited to the synovium.

WHICH ANTIBIOTICS NEED TO BE GIVEN?

figure 1A suggesting gross shortening of left lower limb

humerus). The current trend is towards mini-invasive surgeries
(Figs 3 and 4), particularly in neonates; or arthroscopic joint
lavage rather than big incisions. Smaller joints can usually be
effectively treated by regular aspiration and rarely need open
surgical drainage.
Drainage of pus by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon
decompresses the joint with drainage of pus leading to
increased vascularity and healing. The antibiotics which were
not able to reach the local site due to tight compartment like
pressure are able to reach the infection site after drainage of
pus. This ultimately results in rapid healing of bone and joint
due to clearance of tissue-destroying fluid and also due to
decrease in the tamponade effect on the delicate circulation
around the growth plate.
Pus or fluid obtained during surgery must be sent for Gram
staining and appropriate culture which helps in selection

ch-151.indd 736

Since Gram-positive organisms are most frequently responsi­
ble for the infection, an antibiotic that is effective against
these organisms should be started empirically. In infants and
children, a third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime,
ceftriaxone) are the drug of choice combined with amikacin
or gentamicin which provide coverage against many S.
aureus (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus), most streptococci,
Haemophilus influenzae, and Kingella kingae.
Linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and tobramycin
are reserved until there is a positive report to support their
use. Once an organism has been identified, coverage can be
narrowed based on results of susceptibility testing.

WHICH IS THE PREFERRED ROUTE
OF ANTIBIOTICS?
The initiation of treatment should be with intravenous anti­
biotics only. The oral route is preferred for maintenance phase.

HOW LONG ANTIBIOTICS NEED
TO BE GIVEN?
The duration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy is a matter
of debate. While the final choice is decided by the prevalent
pathogen in the bacteriological and culture report, the duration
of intravenous treatment varies from 7 days to 5 weeks.

There are many studies which has proven efficacy of
minimum 3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by 2–3
weeks of oral therapy (total 4–6 weeks). The author follows the
regimen of 2–3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by
oral antibiotics for 2–3 weeks at our center. Few studies have
indicated a shortened course of appropriate antibiotics for 3
weeks is as efficacious as 6 weeks of parenteral therapy.
Close monitoring of the clinical, blood, and radiological
parameters is required to ensure that the treatment is effective
and the outcome satisfactory. Antibiotics can usually be
stopped by 6 weeks if the child has improved. Radiographs
must be taken 6 monthly to see for any sequelae which develop
in future.
Based on the latest review of literature, use of intravenous
antibiotics till child improves clinically and starts weight
bearing, followed by oral antibiotics for 4–6 weeks seems to
be a standard regimen. The duration of antibiotics depends
on the clinical recovery rather than a fixed time frame. To start
with, an intravenous route is preferred. Once the clinical signs
improve and CRP levels touch baseline, the antibiotic may be
given orally.

WHERE AND WHO SHOULD PERFORM
THE JOINT ASPIRATION?
Although older literature mentions about drainage in the
emergency room, recent guidelines suggest to be done under
aseptic atmosphere like operation theater or sterile neonatal

Clinical Pearls
• Suspect septic arthritis in all neonates with decreased
movements of limb or painful movements of limb
• Suspect septic arthritis in all toddlers or children having gait
disturbance with history of fever
• Give joint lavage as earliest as possible
• Joint lavage should be given in aseptic conditions preferably
in operation theater or sterile neonatal intensive care unit/
pediatric intensive care unit room (preferably by pediatric
orthopedic surgeon who will keep follow-up of the case
managing sequelae in long term)
• Send joint fluid for microbiological evaluation
• X-rays and ultrasonography are helpful in diagnosis
• Empirical antibiotics should be commenced after prompt
drainage of joint collections
• Start antibiotics with intravenous route only
• Further choice of antibiotics will depend on culture report and
clinical course
• Once clinical course is better shift to oral route of antibiotics
• Keep patient in long-term follow-up for observation of
sequelae and their subsequent management.

intensive care unit/pediatric intensive care unit room. It should
be done by a person well worse with anatomy of particular
joint (preferably by pediatric orthopedic surgeon).

Is Simple Joint Aspiration Sufficient or a Joint
Wash Need to Be Done?
Joint wash gives an additional advantage of reducing the
bacterial load and thereby better chances of healing. Hence,
whenever a pediatric orthopedic surgeon is available he
should be involved in the management and a thorough joint
wash should be done rather than simple aspiration.

What is the Role of Plaster Cast/Splints/Traction?
Plaster cast/splints help in immobilization of the joint and
better healing particularly initial 1–2 weeks of treatment. Hip
spica is needed in cases of septic hip dislocations to achieve the
containment. Joint should not be immobilized for prolonged
time to avoid stiffness. In children, traction helps in reducing
the pain as well as correcting the deformity. On traction,
movements need to be started as earliest as possible.

Angular and Rotational
Deformities in Children
Taral V Nagda, Venkatadass Krishnamoorthy

INTRODUCTION
Any deviation from the normal alignment of the limb in
coronal plane is termed as angular deformity and that in
transverse or axial plane is termed as rotational (torsional)
deformity. While angular deformities are obviously seen as
outward or inward deviation of legs, children with rotational
deformities often present with either in-toeing or out-toeing
walking. This chapter discusses in brief the common causes of
these abnormalities and an algorithmic approach to each of
this clinical scenario.

ANGULAR DEFORMITIES IN CHILDREN

Usually, it passes through the center of the knee joint. Medial
deviation of mechanical axis is seen in genu varum and lateral
deviation is seen in genu valgum. The measure of the deviation
of mechanical axis of lower limb from the center of knee joint is
called as “mechanical axis deviation (MAD)”. The other angles
which needs to routinely measured are mechanical lateraldistal femoral angle, medial proximal tibial angle, modified
tibiofemoral angle (TFA), and joint line convergence angle
(Fig. 1).

Genu Varum (Algorithm 1)
Causes of genu varum are given in box 1.

Genu varum (bow legs) and genu valgum (knock knees) are
the most common angular deformities for which the child is
brought to the pediatric orthopedic clinic.

Normal Variation During Growth
Before going to the pathological genu varum and valgum, it is
important to know the normal variation during growth. Most
newborns have bow legs, with 10–15° of varus angulation. This
gradually corrects until 18–24 months of age. After 2 years,
there is valgus angulation with maximum valgus occurring
around 4 years of age. The limb usually reaches normal adult
alignment of 6–7° of valgus by around 11 years of age.

Radiological Assessment of
Alignment of Lower Limb
Full length standing radiograph of both lower limbs covering
from both the hip joints to ankle joints with patellae facing
anteriorly is the standard radiograph needed for analyzing
the angular deformities of lower limbs. This should be
standardized as management decisions are made based on
this radiograph. Mechanical axis is drawn by the line joining
the center of the femoral head to the center of tibial plafond.

examination will have other signs of active rickets. The X-rays
show cupping and flaring of the metaphysis with widening of
the physis. Active rickets will have to be treated with vitamin D
supplements and the deformity needs to be observed.
The children with active rickets who are not responding to
vitamin D supplements are likely to have vitamin D resistant
rickets and they need to be investigated preferably by a
pediatric endocrinologist and managed accordingly.
It is not uncommon to see children presenting with
bowlegs after the active rickets has healed. The persistent
deformity needs to be corrected to get the mechanical axis
of the lower limb to normal. Guided growth in the form of
temporary hemiepiphysiodesis with a tension band plate
(8 plate) applied on the lateral side is the preferred form of
treatment when the physes remains open. The parents must
be counseled well about the need for regular follow-up X-rays
at 3–4 monthly intervals and the need for 8-plate removal
once the deformity is corrected. In children for whom the
physes are closed or those with sick physis not responding to
guided growth, the deformity is corrected by osteotomy.

Blount’s Disease
Blount’s disease also called as tibia vara is classified into three
types based on the age of onset of the deformity.
• Infantile tibia vara: less than 3 years
• Juvenile tibia vara: 4–10 years
• Adolescent tibia vara: more than 10 years.
Infantile Blount’s disease is considered to be a disorder on
the other end of the spectrum of physiological bowing.

Clinical Features

Box 1: Causes of genu varum
• Physiological genu varum
• Infantile Blount’s disease
• Metabolic disorders

• Skeletal dysplasias
• Focal fibrocartilaginous
dysplasia

Physiological Genu Varum
Bow legs usually become prominent when the child starts
walking and the parents get concerned about the deformity.
Physiological genu varum is common in early walkers and
in obese children. In physiologic genu varum, there may be
associated tibial intorsion. There are no other significant
positive findings on clinical examination. X-rays of the knees
may show an apparent delay in the ossification of the medial
side of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses or
flaring of the medial distal femoral metaphysis. The physes
are normal. Majority of children less than 2 years of age have
physiological genu varum, which needs reassurance to parents
and follow-up evaluation. The genu varum that persists after
2 years of age is considered to be pathological and needs to be
investigated further.

Nutritional Rickets

740

Nutritional rickets is one of the most common causes for bowed
legs in developing countries. The typical clinical scenario
would be a child presenting with bowed legs and on clinical

ch-152.indd 740

The two major features which helps in differentiating
physiologic genu varum from infantile tibia vara is that the
child is usually obese (>95th percentile) and the presence
of lateral thrust while walking. This sudden lateral knee
movement with weight bearing is caused by varus instability
at the joint. This sign, though not pathognomonic of infantile
tibia vara, increases the level of suspicion and is an indication
for radiography, regardless of the age of the patient.

Radiographic Findings
A standardized standing anteroposterior view of the lower
extremities from hip to ankle with both patellae facing forwards
must be obtained. The diagnosis is based on radiographic
changes in the proximal end of the tibia as follows (Fig 2):
• A sharp varus angulation in the metaphysis
• A widened and irregular physeal line medially
• A medially sloped and irregularly ossified epiphysis
• Prominent beaking of medial metaphysis with lucent
cartilage islands within the beak
• Lateral subluxation of the proximal end of the tibia.
Infantile Blount’s disease in early stages and young patients
can be managed by Blount’s brace, which needs to be worn
23 hours a day. Though the compliance rates are very poor with
brace treatment, there is good evidence in the literature that
in early stages of the disease just braces could normalize the
mechanical axis of the limb. Persistent and severe deformities

Chapter 152: Angular and Rotational Deformities in Children

Focal Fibrocartilaginous Dysplasia
Focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia is a rare cause of unilateral
genu varum in an infant or toddler. Careful clinical examination
reveals that the deformity is slightly more distal than the knee
joint. On weight bearing and walking, the child may have a
lateral thrust along with associated hyperextension of the knee
which is not a feature of Blount’s disease.

Radiographic Findings

Fig. 2: An X-ray of a child with bilateral Blount’s disease

X-rays show a characteristic abrupt varus at the metaphysealdiaphyseal junction of the tibia, clearly not involving the physis.
There is cortical sclerosis in and around the area of the abrupt
varus on the medial cortex. A radiolucent lesion may be seen
just proximal to the area of cortical sclerosis, which probably
corresponds to the fibrocartilaginous tissue. The etiology of
this defect and the pathogenesis of the deformity are unknown.
The importance of recognizing this variation of infantile
tibia vara is that the deformity can resolve without surgery.
Surgical treatment may be necessary if the deformity progresses
or fails to resolve during a period of observation or orthotic
management.

in late stages will require surgical correction in the form of
corrective osteotomy (Fig. 3).

Skeletal Dysplasia
Children with genu varum secondary to skeletal dysplasia
usually have associated short stature. The dysplasia could
be either at the epiphysis, metaphysis or the diaphysis. The
common dysplasias which present with genu varum are
achondroplasia, pseudochondroplasia and metaphysealchondrodysplasia (Schmid/McKusick) and hereditary
multiple exostosis. Genu varum in these children will need
surgical correction to restore the mechanical axis. It is worth­
while considering growth modulation or guided growth in
these patients while the physes are open. Those children
who are not ideal for growth modulation will need corrective
osteotomy.

ch-152.indd 741

Causes of genu valgum are given in box 2.
Valgus alignment of the lower extremities is normal in a
child between 2 years and 6 years of age. The maximum amount
of physiologic valgus occurs between the ages of 2 years and 4
years, after which the alignment of the lower extremity assumes
a mild valgus femoral-tibial angle, the normal alignment in an
adult.
In a younger child, X-rays are not routinely indicated.
Alignment X-rays are indicated in the following situations:
• Presence of short stature
• History of trauma or infection
• Features suggestive of metabolic bone disease
• Asymmetrical genu valgum.
The rotational profile of the extremity must be evaluated
carefully because an apparent increase in valgus may result
from increased femoral anteversion.

Idiopathic Genu Valgum
Significant genu valgum that persists after 7 years of age
without any identifiable underlying cause is usually labeled as
idiopathic genu valgum. Surgical correction is indicated when
there is significant MAD (the mechanical axis passing lateral
to the lateral-tibial plateau). If untreated this may lead to gait

over correction and development of opposite deformity. In
children who present late where the physis is fused, corrective
osteotomy is indicated.

Metabolic Disorders
Genu valgum may be presenting feature of a child with
chronic renal failure. Apart from nutritional rickets, renal
rickets must be ruled out in all children presenting with genu
valgum by doing renal function tests. Correcting the metabolic
abnormality gets the first priority in these children followed by
deformity correction later on.

Skeletal Dysplasia
Multiple hereditary exostosis, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, and focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia are rare causes of genu valgum. The deformity
needs to be corrected when there is severe MAD irrespective
of the etiology.

Growth modulation with medial hemiepiphysiodesis using
a tension band plate is currently the preferred method of
achieving correction while the physis is open (Fig. 4). However,
one must be aware that in genu valgum, correction is rapid

Proximal tibial fracture in toddlers (Cozen’s fracture) is known
to cause unilateral valgus deformity. Though the etiology of
this condition remains undetermined, there is strong evidence
in the literature that most of these deformities would correct
spontaneously and hence need to be observed periodically for
improvement of the deformity.

Clinical Pearl
Beware of unilateral deformity; it is most likely to be pathological.

seeking opinion for abnormal inward or outward positioning
of the feet while walking. Though majority of the rotational
deformities in early childhood are benign and gets resolved
spontaneously with growth, it is important to do a thorough
clinical examination to locate the anatomical site of the
deformity. A comprehensive history along with a thorough
physical examination helps in differentiating benign from
pathologic causes of rotational abnormalities.

Common Causes of
Rotational Deformities in Children
Majority of the rotational anomalies in children are physiologic
variations (Box 3), which resolve over a period of time. Very
rarely physiologic variations may persist or become rigid
deformities, which then would warrant a surgical intervention.
Pathologic causes of rotational deformities need to be identified
and managed appropriately.

• Metabolic disorders
• Skeletal dysplasia
• Rigid pes planus with or
without tarsal coalition
• Slipped capital femoral
epiphysis.

Pathologic Causes for Rotational Deformities
Pathological causes for rotational deformities are given in
box 4.

Evaluation of Child with Rotational Deformity
A good history with systematic clinical examination is
recommended in all children presenting with in-toeing or
out-toeing while walking. The following findings would point
towards a pathologic cause of rotational deformity:
• A hypoxic or infective event in neonatal period
• Delayed developmental milestones
• A family history of hip dysplasia or a neurologic disorder
• Spasticity, a neurologic deficit, or signs of muscular dystrophy
• Limping or another abnormality of gait of sudden onset
• Deformities of the foot.

Section 19: Orthopedics
A comprehensive recording of the patient’s history
combined with a thorough physical examination are essential
for differentiating benign from pathologic causes of rotational
abnormalities. Studies present various conclusions in terms of
the age beyond which the persistence of in-toeing is abnormal.
However, the general consensus is that no natural correction of
a rotational malalignment should be expected beyond the age
of 10 years, although exceptions to this do occur.

Investigations

is the angle between the longitudinal axis of the foot and
an imaginary line of progression of the body through space
(Fig. 5). A positive or external FPA of 0–20° is considered
normal, but the angle varies with age and may necessitate
observation over time and correlation with the remainder
of the physical examination. A negative FPA indicates that
the child is walking with in toeing. Foot progression angle
is also an important indicator of dynamic causes of intoeing such as tibialis anterior overactivity
Step 2 [external rotation and internal rotation (IR) at both
hip joints]: femoral anteversion is diagnosed clinically
when a child has more IR than external rotation of the hip.
In infants, IR of the hip averages 40°, with a range of 10–60°,
and external rotation averages 65° with a range of 45–90°
Step 3 [thigh foot angle (TFA)]: it is determined in the prone
position as the angle between the longitudinal axis of the
foot (usually along the second ray) and the longitudinal
axis of the thigh, with the knee flexed to 90° and the
ankle in neutral position (Fig. 6). Factors influencing the
TFA include tibial torsion and any hind foot or forefoot
deformities. The average TFA is negative or internal by
5° in infants, and becomes positive or external by 10° by
approximately 8 years of age.

In-toeing

744

The three most common causes of in-toeing are persistent
femoral anteversion, internal tibial torsion, and metatarsus
adductus. In-toeing is usually the result of metatarsus
adductus in an infant, of internal tibial torsion in a toddler, and
of femoral anteversion both in children older than 2.5 years
and in adolescents.
Among causes for out-toeing, which is less common, are
diminished femoral anteversion and, less frequently, femoral
retroversion, external tibial torsion, pes calcaneovalgus, and
external rotational contracture of the hip. Out-toeing, when
seen in newborns, is often a consequence of intrauterine
positioning of the foot in dorsiflexion against the shin, or
calcaneovalgus. In infants and toddlers, it is often the result of
external capsular contracture of the hip, and in older children
the consequence of true bone torsion or pes planovalgus.

ch-152.indd 744

As benign variations in the rotational profile of the lower
extremities are quite common in children, imaging is not
routinely required in the assessment of an in-toeing or outtoeing gait unless indicated by a clinically suspected patho­logy.
It is also important to know that deformities in the rotational
or axial plane are difficult to interpret on standard twodimensional radiographs. Indications for supplemental radio­
graphic imaging include the presence of leg-length discrepancy,
asymmetric findings, limp, pain, spasticity, recent changes in
gait, persistence of a deformity into adolescence, and cosmetic
concerns. Children older than 6 months who present with a leglength discrepancy, an asymmetric rotational profile, or both
should have an anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis to rule
out hip dysplasia or other abnormalities of the hip.

Metatarsus Adductus
In metatarsus adductus, there is inward deviation of the
forefoot relative to the hind foot. Metatarsus adductus is
the most common congenital foot deformity and it resolves
spontaneously in more than 90% of children. A rigid forefoot
adduction deformity with a prominent plantar crease, which
often requires surgical management, is termed as “metatarsus
varus” by some authors. For simplicity, these deformities are
now classified as actively correctable, passively correctable
or rigid.
The clinical hallmark of the condition is medial deviation of
the forefoot relative to the hind foot. When the foot is viewed from
the plantar surface, the sole of the foot appears bean shaped.
It is important to establish the degree of flexibility of the
deformity. In mild cases, the foot will correct actively when the
lateral border of the foot is stimulated. In less flexible cases,
the foot will not correct actively but can easily be corrected
passively. A rigid deformity has a medial soft-tissue crease at
the tarso-metatarsal level and a medial soft-tissue contracture
that prevents passive correction of the foot.
If the metatarsus adductus is flexible and spontaneously
corrects as the foot is stimulated into active eversion, it does
not warrant any treatment. These mild deformities will
resolve gradually. Parents should be reassured and shown
how to gently stretch the foot and how to stimulate it to
achieve active correction. Passively correctable deformities
can either be casted or be maintained on a splint. Majority
of the rigid deformities will be corrected by serial casting.
Surgical intervention is indicated very rarely for those patients
with persistent deformity or those presenting late with rigid
deformities and in older patients with recurrence of the
deformities.

Chapter 152: Angular and Rotational Deformities in Children

Tibial Torsion
Tibial torsion is defined by the angular difference between the
transmalleolar axis and the bicondylar axis of the knee. Medial
tibial torsion is most apparent when infants first begin to
walk. This contributes to physiologic genu varum, which often
presents in toddlers younger than 2.5 years. A slightly externally
rotated hip combined with an internally rotated tibia will give
the appearance of genu varum even if the knee is normal in
the coronal plane. This “apparent genu varum” is frequently
confused with true infantile tibia vara (Blount’s disease), but
can usually be differentiated from the latter by serial physical
examinations done over a period of a few months. If torsion
alone is present, the knee with the patella facing forward has
an orientation that ranges from neutral to slight valgus. Classic
tibial torsion usually improves spontaneously, whereas true
Blount disease tends to progress to greater varus deformity.
External tibial torsion, which is less common than classic tibial
torsion, has a greater potential for persistence into adolescence.
Physical examination of the lower extremities is normal or
may show physiologic genu varum and negative TFA. Medial
tibial torsion resolves spontaneously and hence does not need
any treatment. Efforts aimed at changing the torsional profile
of a long bone with an orthosis or other splint is generally
ineffective. It is better to avoid such devices as there is a
possibility of creating a second deformity through the joints.
Due to the benign natural history of the condition and
the generally unattractive and ineffective nature of orthotic
management, observation and parental education are the
main forms of treatment of tibial torsion. A small segment
of the population with severe (>2 standard deviation above
the mean) medial tibial torsion that does not resolve
spontaneously may need treatment. On the other hand,
excessive external tibial torsion might not resolve and,
therefore, might need treatment at a later age. In either case,
moderate-to-severe deformities that fail to resolve should
alert the orthopedist to the possibility of an underlying
neurologic problem, such as cerebral palsy.
Surgical management by rotational osteotomy may
therefore be necessary in the rare situation in which the
child has persistent functional or cosmetic problems after
8 years of age. Rotational tibial osteotomies should probably
be performed only in a child with a persistent deformity
exceeding 15° internal FPA or 30° external FPA at age 8 years
or older, thereby ensuring that no other rotational change or
gait accommodation is likely to occur, and in whom definite
functional and psychological disturbances appear to be
present.

Femoral Anteversion
Femoral version is defined as the angular difference between
the axis of the femoral neck and the transcondylar axis of the
knee. Medial femoral torsion is a common clinical problem
during early childhood. It is twice as common in girls as in
boys. Normally, children are born with an average femoral

anteversion of 40°, which diminishes to approximately 12–16° at
skeletal maturity, resolving at a rate of approximately 1.5° per
year. This “normalization” with growth is usually achieved by
approximately 8–10 years of age.
The child sits with the limbs in the W position, walks with an
in-toeing gait with the patella medially rotated and runs in an
awkward pattern. The appearance while running is described
as egg-beater pattern and the walking is described as pigeontoed gait. Tripping as a result of crossing the feet may occur in
some children.
Clinical examination reveals increased internal rotation
and decreased external rotation. Imaging is not routinely
indicated, unless there is asymmetrical version. A computed
tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging is needed
to exactly measure the amount of version and this is only
indicated for surgical planning rather than as a diagnostic aid.
Majority of the children resolve spontaneously and the
parents need to be reassured and also counseled to encourage
their child sit cross-legged and avoid “W sitting”. In a select
group of children with persistent increased femoral anteversion
(IR >80°) with severe cosmetic and functional limitation derotation osteotomy of the proximal femur is indicated to
correct the deformity.

Approach to a
Child with a Limp
Sandeep A Patwardhan, Anirban Chatterjee, Arjun A Dhawale

INTRODUCTION
A limp is any deviation from the normal gait pattern. The
incidence of limping in children is unknown. A child walking
with an abnormal gait pattern is a cause of concern for parents
and the attending pediatrician. As a number of conditions may
be the cause of a limp, a systematic approach is needed for
appropriate treatment to be initiated.

DIAGNOSIS
Abnormal gait can be antalgic (Algorithm 1) or nonantalgic.
Common abnormal gait patterns are shown in box 1 and

common causes of limp in different age groups are shown in
box 2. A detailed history, physical examination, laboratory
tests, and imaging are necessary for making a diagnosis.
Common tests are shown in table 1.

HISTORY
The importance of obtaining a detailed history from the
child or parents cannot be overemphasized. Some of the
important questions to be answered are: is the onset acute,
insidious, or chronic? Is the limp persistent or periodic,
static or progressive and if there are any systemic symptoms
like fever or weight loss. If there is pain, is it localized and

what its aggravating and relieving factors are. Some examples
are:

anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs)

tuberculosis
Tumor: relentless pain, not relieved by medication; night

exception of osteoid osteoma, where pain relief is known
with ibuprofen.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
It should be noted whether the child walked in or was carried
into the consulting room or walked in. If the child walked in
then some observation of the gait is possible even before a
detailed clinical examination.
To properly analyze the gait, the child should be undressed
and made to walk along a corridor, run, and get up from sitting/
squatting position, provided it is painless. In case the limp is
acute in origin and painful, then such a detailed visual analysis
of gait may not be performed. While the child is walking, one
needs to observe the trunk, the pelvis, hips, knees, and the
ankle foot complex individually. One also needs to observe the
shoes, especially the wear characteristics of the heel and sole.

Local Examination
At the end of the history and examination of the gait, one
should have narrowed down the differential diagnosis (DD)
and also mentally decide which limb, which bone or which
joint needs to be examined in more detail. To avoid missing
out any subtle signs, examination should include the spine
and lower extremities including hip joints, knee joints, and
ankle-foot complex with the child suitably undressed. A useful
dictum to follow for local examination of a part is look, feel,
move, measure, and perform (special tests).
Focal examination should be done if infection or trauma is
suspected.

Section 19: Orthopedics

Clinical Pearls
• Onset, duration, and progress of limp and associated or
absence of pain must be elicited clearly
• Origin of pathology in a limping child may be from the
foot to the spine
• Think of the most common conditions first according to
age.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Transient Synovitis
Transient synovitis is commonly seen in children aged 3–8 years
with acute onset of hip pain and limping with a decreased range
of movements. Often, there is a history of a preceding viral
illness. Ultrasound findings of joint effusion with no elevation
of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
with a normal or slight elevation in white blood cell count help
corroborate the diagnosis. Treatment is observation, rest, and
analgesics.

Septic Arthritis
Septic arthritis can occur at any age from the neonatal
period. There is an acute onset of pain, limping, and fever
with restricted hip range of movements. Differentiation from
transient synovitis is based on history of fever, inability to bear
weight, elevated ESR, and leukocytosis (>12,000 cells/mL). The
probability of a diagnosis of septic arthritis increases with the
number of criteria present; ultrasound to assess joint effusion
and synovial thickening. Radiographs, although not helpful
in the early stages, identifies associated osteomyelitis, softtissue swelling, or hip subluxation. Early intervention with
hip arthrotomy and 6 weeks of antibiotic coverage as per the
culture sensitivity is the standard of care.

Osteomyelitis

are common injuries and are diagnosed with appropriate
radiographs. Treatment depends on the location and type
of fracture and the age of the patient. Closed treatment of
long bone fractures with casting or elastic nailing is usually
the norm. Epiphyseal injuries and joint injuries should be
identified with a thorough local examination and if suspected
then an magnetic resonance imaging is useful.

Limb Length Discrepancy
Children with a limb length discrepancy (LLD) will toe
walk on the shorter side. The shortening may be due to
developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), congenital short
femur, postinfective physeal growth arrest, or hemimelia
(Fig. 2). Apart from treatment of the primary pathology, a
lower extremity scanogram will document the LLD. Treatment
is usually a shoe raise and observation for a difference of up

Osteomyelitis in children usually occurs as a result of
hematogenous spread of bacteria. The most common organism
is Staphylococcus aureus, with incidence of methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) increasing. The child will present
with fever, limping, localized swelling, and tenderness.
Although metaphyseal involvement is more common, the
diaphysis may be involved less often. In acute osteomyelitis,
early radiographs may only show soft-tissue swelling and
radiographs after a few weeks will show periosteal reaction
(Fig. 1) and bone destruction. A 6-week course of appropriate
antibiotics is initiated after obtaining blood cultures and local
cultures after surgical drainage.

Fracture
748

Children with trauma to the lower extremity may present with
a limp. These could commonly occur while playing or due
to motor vehicle accidents. Fractures of the femur and tibia

Chapter 153: Approach to a Child with a Limp
to 2 cm. For a greater LLD, lengthening of the short limb with
an external fixator or an epiphysiodesis of the contralateral
extremity are options after serial documentation of the
discrepancy.

Developmental Dysplasia of Hip
Incidence of neglected DDH is higher in India and other
developing countries due to the absence of screening programs
and unequal distribution of healthcare facilities and personnel
in urban and rural areas. This often results in a missed diagnosis
of DDH and children present with a limp (Fig. 3). Diagnosis
of DDH in a child of walking age can be made clinically on
hip examination by eliciting a telescopy sign and restricted
abduction with LLD. The pelvis anteroposterior radiograph will
confirm the diagnosis of DDH. Treatment depends on the age
of the child. After walking age, open reduction is necessary and
may be combined with a femoral and acetabular osteotomy to
relocate the head into the acetabulum.

Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is more common in
overweight adolescent boys. Onset of limp and pain could be
insidious in stable slips or acute with inability to bear weight
in unstable slips. Some patients may complain of knee pain
(due to referred pain). Patients will have restricted range of
hip movements, with obligatory external rotation on flexion
and restricted internal rotation. Anteroposterior and lateral
hip X-rays are diagnostic of the slip. Bilateral involvement
could occur. An endocrinology workup should be completed.
Treatment is dependent on the degree of slip and usually
involves surgery with in-situ pinning for mild-to-moderate
slips and management of any underlying endocrinological
condition, if present.

Perthes Disease
Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease usually presents with a painful limp
with restricted internal rotation of the hip in children between

Fig. 4: Perthes disease of the right hip in an 11-year-old male with
extrusion and flattening of the head

6 and 11 years. The prognosis is better in younger children
due to the better remodeling potential of the capital femoral
epiphysis. Although many theories have been postulated, the
etiology is not well defined. The pelvis radiograph will show
collapse or extrusion depending on the stage of the disease
(Fig. 4). Treatment depends on the age of the patient and stage
of the disease, the principle being to contain the hip with an
abduction cast, femoral varus osteotomy, or an acetabular
shelf procedure.

Osteoid Osteoma
The child will present with boring pain in the extremity with
worsening at night and typically NSAIDs will relieve the pain.
A computed tomography scan can confirm the diagnosis
with a sclerotic ring surrounding a nidus being the classical
radiographic appearance. Treatment is image-guided
radiofrequency ablation or surgical excision.

Juvenile Arthritis
Juvenile arthritis is an important DD in a child with a limp
who presents with pain in the knee, ankle, or subtalar joints.
Swelling with some restriction of movement will be present
along with an elevated ESR and antinuclear antibody positive
titer, although this may often be negative. Orthopedic inter­
vention is rarely needed.

Clinical Pearls
What to tell the parents?

• Investigations are necessary to prove diagnosis or rule out

Pulled Elbow, Growing Pains,
and Flatfoot
Premal Naik, Hitesh B Chauhan

•

PULLED ELBOW
Pulled elbow is a common injury in children under the age of 5
years. It is a minor soft-tissue injury of the radiohumeral joint
caused by sudden traction on the hand, wrist, or forearm.

Incidence
Five percent of all upper limb injuries less than 10 years age:
• Boys more than girls
• Left more than right.

•
•

Child’s forearm or hand is held firmly by a parent as the
child attempts to run away
Child is lifted by an adult from the ground by his/her hands
Child may be lifted by the hand from a lying or sitting
position or may be swung around by the hands/wrist while
playing.

Pathology
Traction on pronated forearm with extended elbow → partial
escape of radial head from annular ligament → pulled elbow

Mechanism of Injury

Clinical Features (Algorithm 1)

Forcible traction applied to the child’s pronated hand or wrist
with the elbow extended; common circumstances, which leads
to such traction injury, are:

Child presents with painful dangling arm (infant will present
with pseudoparalysis), child does not use the affected limb
for holding objects, keeps the elbow extended and forearm

pronated, and resists supination of forearm. There is no
obvious tenderness, edema, or deformity at elbow.

Algorithm for growing pains

Investigations
Pulled elbow is a clinical diagnosis, but when the mode of
trauma and history are not corroborative, X-ray is indicated.

Treatment
Reduction Maneuver
•

•
•
•

Hold the child’s wrist with one hand and with other hand
support the elbow and palpate the radial head → supinate
the forearm with upward push on the radial head → click is
felt with radial head reduction
Sometimes pronation and flexion of elbow is also required
for reduction
Click signals successful reduction, the child will be playful
and will use the arm after sometime
If the child is not using arm immediately, should be sent
home with analgesics and should be called the next day.

Precautions
An important aspect in the management of pulled elbow is to
advise the parents to avoid traction on the child’s arm. They
should not pull child from hands or wrists. Parents should be
advised to discuss this with neighbors and relatives who are
expected to handle the child any time.

Clinical Pearl
• Look for mode of trauma or mechanism of injury, age of
the child, absence edema or deformity at elbow, pronation
attitude of forearm, and presence of previous history of similar
complaints → clinically pulled elbow → reduction maneuver
→ feel click → dramatic improvement in movements → no
immobilization required.

•
•
•
•

Pain is most commonly in calf and ankle region and
sometimes is so severe that child cries with pain
Few children demand massaging for relief of pain
Primarily involves lower extremities and is mostly bilateral
Typically child resumes normal activity next day.

On Examination
•
•
•
•
•

Normal walking pattern without limp
No local tenderness or swelling in joints and muscles
No muscular spasticity or restriction of joints movements
No wasting or neurological deficit. Gower test will be
negative
No limb length discrepancy or limb wasting.

Investigations
If history is not corroborative, any other condition should be
ruled out with X-rays and blood investigations.

Differential Diagnosis

Incidence

If there is history of trauma and excessive exertion with local
bony tenderness, rule out stress fracture with X-ray. Tumorlike osteoid osteoma, osteogenic sarcomas, or Ewing’s give
rise to night pain, but are more aggressive and associated with
localized swelling, tenderness and limb wasting.

Management

GROWING PAINS (Algorithm 2)
These are idiopathic benign pains or discomfort in children.

Fifteen to thirty percent of all children
More common in girls.

Etiology
Idiopathic in nature, no documented cause has been discovered.

Clinical Features

752

JIA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis; S. CPK, serum creatine phosphokinase.

Growing pain is a diagnosis of exclusion. All other causes of leg
aches are to be excluded before stamping it as growing pain.
• History is typically vague and of long duration
• Not associated with any functional disability
• Usually occurs at night (just before going to sleep).
Occasionally child may get up from sleep due to pain

ch-154.indd 752

After ruling out any other cause of pain, diagnosis of growing
pains is considered.
No specific treatment, hot fomentation, massage, and
analgesic may help.
Most importantly, parents should be reassured and made
to understand that growing pain are self-limiting and will
subside in due course of time. One can be made to understand
relation of pain with sudden increase in height of their child
(growth spurt) in last few months.
Relapse may occur in next growth spurt. If any other
symptoms like swelling, wasting, and fever develop on followup, child should be subjected to further investigation.

Clinical Pearl
Long and vague history, bilateral lower extremity, night pain,
mainly calf and ankle, normal activities next day, no clinical
findings → no radiological findings → diagnosis of exclusion →
reassurance, diversion of mind, relapses may occur → look for
warning signals.

•

Rigid flatfoot: arch is absent all the time, whether child is
bearing weight or not. It may be due to:
{{ Tarsal coalition
{{ Juvenile chronic arthritis
Neuromuscular flatfoot: flatfoot secondary to muscular
imbalance, weakness or spasticity. Common causes are:
{{ Cerebral palsy
{{ Spina bifida.

Differential Diagnosis

FLATFOOT
Absence of medial longitudinal arch of foot is known as flatfoot
(Algorithm 3).

Incidence
It occurs approximately 20–30% of general population.

Other conditions which give similar appearance as of flatfoot
are:
• Congenital vertical talus
• Accessory navicular.

Clinical Features
•

Classification
•

•

Flexible flatfoot: arch is absent when patient bears weight
but appears off weight. It is be due to hyperlaxity of
ligaments (Fig. 1)

•
•

Algorithm  3
Algorithm for flatfoot patient

Primarily parents complaint of awkward appearance of
foot, uneven shoe ware, or sometimes pain
Family history may be positive: parents tend to have joint
laxity and sometimes flatfeet as well. Tarsal coalitions can
be autosomal dominant or recessive
Many parents are bothered about future participation in
sports and army recruitment.

Examination
•
•
•
•
•
•

In flexible flatfeet: arch disappears on standing, and
reappears on taking weight off. Arch also reappears when
patient stands on toes (Fig. 2)
Wind up test or Jack toe raising test: in flexible flatfoot,
arch can be reproduced by extending great toe at
metatarsophalangeal joint (Fig. 3)
General assessment of signs of hyperlaxity should be
looked for hyperextension of elbows, thumb touching to
forearm, knee hyperextension
In rigid flatfeet, arch is always absent, on or off weight.
Extension of great toe or standing on toes does not form
arch
Movements of the hindfoot are restricted in rigid flatfeet
and free in flexible flatfeet
Heel is in valgus and corrects on tiptoeing in flexible feet

In flexible flatfeet:
Parents are reassured regarding benign nature of
deformity
{{ Promote bare feet walking in sand and garden
{{ Special shoes have no role in management of flexible
flatfeet (in fact early shoe wearing in city kids is found
to have high incidence of flatfeet compared to rural
children walking bare feet)
{{ Arch support only if severe shoe wear and feet pain
{{ Rarely surgery is advised for failed conservative
treatment
In tarsal coalitions: initially, conservative treatment in
form of cast followed by splints and arch support is given. If
it fails then bar excision surgery is required
In neuromuscular flatfeet: Initial conservative treatment is
orthosis. If it fails than surgery in form of muscle balancing
or arthrodesis is required.

Clubfoot Treatment:
Current Concepts
Rujuta Mehta, Alaric J Aroojis

INTRODUCTION
Clubfoot is the one of the most frequent congenital deformity
seen by a pediatrician and referred to a pediatric orthopedic
surgeon. Recent estimates say over 50,000 children are born
with clubfoot in India. Over 3,700 children are born with
clubfoot in Maharashtra which means one in every 500 live
birth is a clubfoot. Significant advances have been made over
the last few decades regarding the treatment of clubfoot. This
chapter will give the reader an overview of diagnosis and
management in concurrence with the changing scenario and
shift back to conservative treatment in view of recent successes
vis-a-vis state of the art management.

DEFINITION
The term congenital talipes equino varus (CTEV) aptly
describes the complex amalgamation of the following
deformities of the entire foot: congenital, from birth; talipes,
foot; equino, equinus posture of the foot complex (like a
horse’s heel) excessive plantar flexion; and varus, inversion
and subluxation on talonavicular joint.

Box 1: Multifactorial inheritance system
Most common etiology
• Idiopathic
• Neuromuscular etiology
• Syndromic/genetic etiology, e.g.:
{{ Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita
{{ Streeter’s dysplasia (constriction band syndrome)
{{ Secondary to decrease of size of the uterus resulting from
early rupture of amnion with chorion remaining intact
Rarer syndromic etiology
• Autosomal dominant: whistling face/Freeman-Sheldon
syndrome (craniocarpotarsal syndrome)
• Autosomal recessive:
{{ Diastrophic dwarfism (micromelia)
{{ Joint contracture, scoliosis, thumb deformities, congenital
talipes equino varus
{{ Larson syndrome
{{ Down’s syndrome
{{ Mobius syndrome

ETIOLOGY
Multifactorial inheritance system due to intrauterine
environment factor leads to idiopathic CTEV (Box 1).

PATHOLOGY
Bony and soft-tissue pathology coexist in clubfeet (Fig. 1).
It is a deformation occurring during the second trimester of
pregnancy and not an embryonic malformation except in the
teratologic variety. Congenital clubfoot is a complex threedimensional deformity having four components: (i) equinus,
(ii) varus, (iii) adductus, and (iv) cavus. The tarsal bones,
which are mostly made up of cartilage, are in the most extreme
positions of flexion, adduction and inversion at birth. The talus

Fig. 1: Dissected fetal clubfoot showing typical bony and
soft-tissue pathology

SECTION 19: Orthopedics
is in severe plantarflexion, its neck is deflected medially and
plantarward, and its head is wedge-shaped. The navicular is
severely medially displaced, in close apposition to the medial
malleolus and articulates with the medial surface of the head
of the talus. The calcaneus is adducted, plantarflexed and
inverted under the talus. The forefoot is in some pronation,
causing the plantar arch to be more concave (cavus). The
calcaneocuboid joint is deviated posteromedially. The deltoid,
tibionavicular ligament and the tibialis posterior tendon are
thickened and merge with the short plantar calcaneonavicular
ligament. The ligaments of the posterior and medial aspects
of the ankle and tarsal joints are very thick and taut, thereby
severely restraining the foot in equinus and the navicular and
calcaneus in adduction and inversion. There is an excessive
pull of the tibialis posterior abetted by the gastrocsoleus, the
tibialis anterior and the long toe flexors.

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The orthopedic officer must have a sensitive and kind approach
to babies. After a general examination to rule out nonidiopathic
clubfeet, parents must be reassured that their baby’s deformity
will be corrected in a few weeks. The baby will have a normallooking and functional foot throughout life as long as they are
faithful to all the details of the treatment program. Radiographs
are not necessary.

MANAGEMENT
Treatment of clubfoot as a generic term cannot be clubbed
together. It is therefore subdivided as follows:
• Treatment in the prewalking age
• Treatment after independent walking is achieved.

Treatment in the Prewalking Age
The most widely practiced current standard of care for
treatment of clubfeet in the first 6 months of life is the Ponseti
method of treatment (Fig. 2). This is a combination of weekly
plastering and a semi-invasive procedure of tenotomy of the

756

A

tendo-Achilles at the final step of correction. This technique of
manipulation and casting is based on anatomical studies and
a biomechanical understanding of the “kinematic coupling”
of the subtalar joint. It corrects all elements of the deformity,
resulting in a functional, pain free, looking plantigrade foot
with good mobility, without calluses, and without the need
for wearing special or modified shoes. Foot examination and
corrective manipulations are best done with the baby resting
on the mother’s lap. When applying the plaster cast, the baby is
placed at one end of the table to provide room for the mother
and assistant on either side. It is best if the baby is breastfed
through the treatment.

Results of the Ponseti Method of Clubfoot Treatment
The Ponseti method is a safe and effective treatment for
congenital idiopathic clubfoot and radically decreases the
need for extensive corrective surgery. it is the most effective
method for children less than 1 or 2 years of age (Fig. 3).

Clinical Pearls
• Treatment can begin as early as first week of life
• Complex deformity yields better under influence of relaxin
with serial casts
• Deformity is corrected within few weeks
• Adherence to protocol is a must.

Treatment after Independent
Walking is Achieved
Various surgical modalities exist for addressing all grades of
severity of clubfeet in the post-walking age group:
• Open surgery: soft-tissue releases and tendon transfer
• Bony surgery
• Fixators.
The axiom “No two clubfeet are exactly the same” is well
accepted now and therefore the corollary that the surgical
treatment has to be catered to the type and need of each case
what is known as “A la carte” approach.

manipulations and casting followed by a percutaneous tendo-Achilles tenotomy

Open Surgery: Soft-tissue Releases
Failures of conservative treatment or late presentations after
the age of 1 or 2 years usually mandate surgical release. Several
operations have been described for this condition since early
1930s. The most widely followed surgery is a posteromedial
release popularized by Vincent Turco in the 1960-70s after he
published his original monograph with a 16-year follow-up. This
surgery addresses almost all the deforming pathoanatomical
structures on the anterior medial and posterior aspects of the
foot and their abnormal interrelationships. The salient features
of this surgery are as follows:
• Release of three joints:
{{ Ankle
{{ Subtalar
{{ Talonavicular
• Release of three ligament groups:
{{ Talocalcaneonavicular, spring ligament, and plantar
fascia
{{ Superficial deltoid or talocalcaneal
{{ Calcaneofibular and talofibular.

•

Lengthening of three tendons:
Tendo-Achilles
{{ Tibialis posterior
{{ Flexors digitorum and hallucis.
Results of this surgery are highly gratifying and longlasting (Fig. 4), but not without their share of complications
and morbidity.
{{

Open Surgery: Tendon Transfer
Tendon transfers are indicated for age groups above 3–5 years
mainly for residual uncorrected components of clubfoot
deformities. Tibialis transfer to the medial cuneiform bone is
indicated for dynamic supination and persistent metatarsus
adductus deformity, which particularly occurs with relapses of
the conservative or Ponseti method of plastering.

Bony Surgery
The incidence of bony surgeries has plummeted in recent
years, particularly with the colossal success of conservative
techniques; however, it deserves mention.

Osteotomies: particularly for hind- and midfoot correction
above the age of 5 years, after majority of the tarsal bones
have ossified
Talectomy/naviculectomy: this is a surgery with a very
select place for the treatment of severe arthrogrypotic feet
where the deformity is so severe and no other operation
can work so as to prevent plantigrade shoe wear
Triple arthrodesis: this is a salvage procedure done at or
around skeletal maturity for very severe or recalcitrant
clubfeet, for the purpose of relieving pain or to facilitate
normal shoe wear.

Fixators
In 1989, Dr BB Joshi from Mumbai, India, started using an
indigenous external fixation system for gradual distraction of
multiplanar deformities of clubfoot. The frame is essentially
constructed on K-wires fixing three segments: (i) tibial, (ii)
calcaneal, and (iii) metatarsal. These three segments are then
interconnected using clamps, rods, and distraction assemblies
are used at altering rhythms in a differential fashion, i.e.,
medial more than equinus more than lateral. The process has

758

been analogous to an external version of Ponseti principles
which gradually unlocks the talus and brings about a complete
correction of all components of clubfoot, however, complex the
deformity. Fixators are invaluable for neglected and relapsed
and rigid clubfeet, particularly 3–14 years (Fig. 5).
Clubfoot is referred at any age and treatment can be
instituted irrespective of age of referral. A simple flowchart on
treatment of clubfoot treatment is depicted in algorithm 1.

ROLE OF EXERCISES AND SPLINTS
Any method of CTEV correction requires maintenance of
correction and sustaining the same till skeletal maturity. This
is achieved by using special footwear in the form of ankle-foot
orthosis or stiff medial border shoes mounted on an abduction
bar with external rotation correction. These are essentially
static devices and need to be supplemented with active and
assisted active exercises and stimulation of the muscles of the
lateral aspect of the foot regularly several times a day over a
number of years. The importance of a regular follow-up and
prevention of relapse thus cannot be overemphasized.

Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip
Jayanth S Sampath, Rujuta Mehta

SPECTRUM OF Developmental
dysplasia of the hip
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a term used to
describe a spectrum of conditions where the hip joint fails to
develop normally during childhood. In the past, descriptions
such as congenital dislocation of the hip were used. The term
hip dysplasia is also commonly used. All of the above terms
refer to the same condition.

INCIDENCE OF Developmental
dysplasia of the hip
The widely quoted figure of 1–2 cases of dislocation per 1,000
live births is an approximation. The reported incidence of
DDH in the literature is influenced by genetic and racial
factors, cultural practices (tight swaddling of neonates
amongst Native Americans), experience and training of the
examiner, diagnostic criteria applied and age of the child at
presentation. The incidence of neonatal hip instability may be
as high as 1 in 100. Since the vast majority of unstable hips in

neonates resolve spontaneously, this is termed physiological
instability.

Clinical Pearl
A significant number of clinically unstable hips (Barlow positive)
resolve spontaneously in the first few weeks of life. This is termed
physiological instability. Hip ultrasound scan is mandatory in
such cases.

CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS
Teratologic dislocations are caused by neuromuscular
conditions such as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, spina
bifida, Larsen syndrome, and diastrophic dysplasia. A specific
cause may not be readily identifiable in typical dislocations.
A positive family history in first-degree relatives increases the
risk of DDH. Wynne Davies reported a risk of 6% with 1 affected
sibling, 12% risk with an affected parent, and 36% when a
parent and a sibling are affected. Other risk factors for DDH,
relative risk, and the presumed pathogenetic mechanisms are
summarized in table 1.

Table 1: Risk factors for developmental dysplasia of the hip, relative risk, and the presumed pathogenetic mechanisms
Risk factor

Mechanism

Breech presentation*

5–6 times (greater risk if Frank breech with hip flexion

babies also at risk

“Clicky” hips at birth

8 times compared to normal hip examination at birth

—

Birth order

>50% of developmental dysplasia of the hip in first born

Tight uterus

Girls

3–6 times greater than boys

Greater susceptibility in girl babies to the maternal
hormone; relaxin causes ligamentous laxity

Side affected

Left:right ratio of 3:1

Left occipitoanterior position causes the left hip to
rest against the mother’s spinal column

Oligohydramnios

Higher risk if clinically significant, low risk if diagnosis
made on sonography

Intrauterine compression

Postural foot deformity

Risk varies from 1 in 27 for postural talipes to 1 in 5 for
calcaneovalgus feet

Extraneous compression of the hip on the affected
side

*Successful external cephalic version for breech presentation reduces, but does not abolish developmental dysplasia of the hip risk. Ultrasound screening of the
hips for babies in this category is recommended.

DIAGNOSING Developmental
dysplasia of the hip
Clinical Examination
There are no pathognomonic physical findings in DDH which
will help the clinician make a reliable diagnosis at any age and
in every child. Considerable skill, experience, and patience
are therefore essential if an accurate diagnosis is to be made.
The clinical features suggestive of DDH change as the child
becomes older. An age-specific approach, therefore, needs to
be adopted when examining the child with suspected DDH.
At or soon after birth (first few weeks of life), Barlow
and Ortolani tests are provocative maneuvers with high
specificity for DDH. They should be performed in every child
at or soon after birth. Barlow test detects an enlocated hip
which dislocates from the acetabulum, whereas the Ortolani
is a “relocation” test which diagnoses a dislocated hip as it
reduces back into the acetabulum. Other clinical signs which
are associated with DDH include asymmetrical groin creases
(Fig. 1), a positive Galeazzi test (Fig. 2) and limb length
discrepancy. Reduced hip abduction (<60°) is a sensitive
clinical indicator of DDH in children over the age of 3 months.
Developmental dysplasia of the hip should be borne
in mind when examining a child with a limp or waddling
gait. An important principle in the diagnosis of DDH is to
detect asymmetry in the limbs (length, range of movement,
etc.). However, it is worth remembering that bilateral DDH
is frequently missed due to lack of asymmetry. Table 2
summarizes the clinical features of DDH at different ages.

Clinical Pearl
All newborns, irrespective of risk factors, should undergo a careful
examination of the hip by a pediatrician at or soon after birth.
Barlow and Ortolani tests should be performed and the results
clearly documented.

Investigations
Though clinical tests for DDH have high specificity (>90%), they
lack sensitivity particularly in neonates and infants (around
60% only). By no means does a normal clinical examination
rule out DDH. The clinician should, therefore, select an
investigation which will conclusively confirm or rule out DDH.
The choice of test again depends on the age of the child.
Children 0–4 months of age: ultrasound scanning of the hips
using the Graf (static) and Harcke (dynamic) methods is
recommended in children younger than 4 months.
In the Graf method, a and b angles are calculated and these
angles guide treatment. The alpha angle is an indicator of the
extent of development of the bony acetabulum (bony roof ).
The b angle is an indicator of development of the cartilaginous
roof (Fig. 3).
The Graf method is precise and has been standardized
to a high degree. Specific training in ultrasound scanning
for hip dysplasia is necessary in order to obtain good quality
ultrasound scans.
Ideally, all newborn babies should undergo a hip ultrasound
scan. Though practiced in certain parts of Europe, Universal

Neonatal Ultrasound Hip Screening cannot be justified due
to cost, logistical hurdles and the relatively low incidence of
abnormal hips requiring treatment. As mentioned earlier, many
physiologically immature hips will resolve spontaneously by 6
weeks of age. Universal screening may result in overtreatment
of immature hips and the possibility of iatrogenic complications
such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
Selective ultrasound hip screening based on risk factors
for DDH has been implemented more widely in the United
Kingdom, United States, and other developed nations.
Common indications and the timing of ultrasound screening
are summarized in table 3.
Children older than 4 months: a good quality anteroposterior
X-ray of the pelvis will clearly demonstrate the problem in the
vast majority of cases. Various lines are drawn on the X-ray by
orthopedic surgeons as illustrated but these are probably of
little interest to pediatricians (Fig. 4).
Briefly, the Hilgenreiner’s (horizontal) line and Perkin’s
(perpendicular) line result in four quadrants. The normal hip
lies in the inner-lower quadrant.

Fig. 4: An X-ray of developmental dysplasia of the hip

WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS?
Treatment of DDH is entirely dependent on the age of the child.
The younger the child at diagnosis, the less the intervention
required. It is, therefore, important that the diagnosis is made
as soon after birth as possible.
Figure 5 summarizes the treatment options for DDH at
different ages. Note that the treatment becomes progressively
more invasive with increasing age at treatment.

Pavlik Harness
This is the least invasive method and, therefore, the most
patient friendly. The harness can be used from birth to the age
of approximately 4 months. The baby can kick both legs freely
within the harness and it does not interfere with normal growth
of the baby (Fig. 6).
Once the baby has been placed in a harness, ultrasound
scans must be repeated every week until the hip is anatomically
located back in the hip joint. This may take 2–4 weeks. Average
time in the harness is likely to be between 10 weeks and

Medial Open Reduction
This is a minimally invasive procedure undertaken in children
under 18 months of age. There are numerous advantages
with this procedure compared to a traditional “anterior open
reduction”. The operation is performed through a small incision
in the groin and, therefore, not visible to the outside. There is
minimal blood loss and less postoperative pain.
The medial open reduction is also referred to as “assisted
closed reduction” or “relaxed closed reduction”. This term is
used because a forcible closed reduction causes damage to the
blood supply of the femoral head and poor long-term results.
Medial open reduction is followed by immobilization in
a hip spica cast for 4–6 months. Long-term results of medial
open reduction have proven that this is a minimally invasive
procedure that is safe and effective.

Anterior Open Reduction with
Femoral and Pelvic Osteotomy

12 weeks. In the vast majority of babies under 3 months (90%
or more), treatment with the Pavlik harness is successful and
results in radiographically normal hips when assessed at 5
years of age.

Clinical Pearl
In summary, early diagnosis (soon after birth) and Pavlik harness
treatment should be considered as the gold standard in
managing hip dysplasia.

Complications of Pavlik harness include avascular necrosis
of the femoral head and transient femoral nerve palsy. These
can be minimized through proper attention to technique
during harness application.

Closed Reduction and
Hip Spica Application

764

If the child is older than 6 months at diagnosis, Pavlik
harness is not appropriate. In this group (6–12 months), an
arthrogram will be necessary. A short general anesthetic is
given. A radiopaque dye is also instilled into the hip joint to
provide contrast. If the hip can be reduced without undue
force, a hip spica is applied. The term closed reduction refers
to reducing a dislocated joint without the need for an incision.
This is in contrast to an open reduction where an incision is
necessary. The total period in the spica ranges from 2 months
to 6 months.
In a dislocated hip, concomitant acetabular dysplasia
(shallow acetabulum) is almost always present. Children
less than 18 months of age possess considerable remodeling
capacity and early reduction of the hip typically results in
spontaneous resolution of the acetabular dysplasia. In children
older than 18 months at presentation, an additional procedure
in the form of a pelvic osteotomy is usually required.

ch-156.indd 764

This procedure is typically used in children older than
18 months who have been walking for a period of time on
the dislocated hip. When a child walks on a dislocated hip,
the capsule enlarges and becomes quite lax. This enlarged
capsule needs to be tightened up in order to prevent the hip
from re-dislocating after surgery. The anterior open reduction
procedure is designed to address this particular problem
of a capacious and redundant capsule. The anterior open
reduction is performed through a “bikini” incision. There are
several tight structures (muscles, tendons, and ligaments)
that are divided or lengthened. The hip joint is relocated and
the capsule repaired to keep the joint in place. Typically, the
shallow socket (acetabulum) is also corrected by means of a
pelvic osteotomy wherein the socket is divided and reset in
the correct alignment. In addition to the pelvic osteotomy, a
femoral osteotomy is also sometimes required.

SUGGESTED READINGS

neglected DDH is approximately 5 years. In children older than
these age thresholds, there is unacceptably high incidence of
iatrogenic complications which compromises the eventual
outcome.

Clinical Pearl
The key to successful management of developmental dysplasia
of the hip is to identify risk factors for DDH in the newborn,
confirm the diagnosis by hip ultrasound scan and institute early
appropriate treatment.

Key points

))
Prewalking dysplasia of the hip (DDH) treatment is more
successful than postwalking. A painless unilateral limp or a
bilateral waddle in a child must always be investigated for
DDH

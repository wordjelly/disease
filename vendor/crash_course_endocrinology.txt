Series editor foreword
The Crash Course series first published in 1997 and now, 15 years on, we are still
going strong. Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this series
relevant for today’s students is an ongoing process. These fourth editions build on
the success of the previous titles and incorporate new and revised material, to keep
the series up to date with current guidelines for best practice, and recent
developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and student
reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fourth editions we have completely rewritten our self-assessment material to keep up with today’s ‘single-best answer’
and ‘extended matching question’ formats. The artwork and layout of the titles has
also been largely re-worked to make it easier on the eye during long sessions of
revision.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles on
which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all the
information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate
basic medical science and clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance
between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient depth for those aiming at
distinction. The authors are medical students and junior doctors who have recent
experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the material is
checked by a team of faculty advisors from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Authors
The point of a medical textbook is to deliver clear and concise information on a specific field of medicine that is
also clinically relevant. This new Crash Course Edition has been revised to focus more clearly on the topic of
endocrinology and link the physiology to the disease processes in a more refined manner. The information on specific
and highly relevant conditions, particularly diabetes, has been increased and the latest guidelines on management
have been added. Other marked differences in this edition are also the removal of the excess of information on
reproductive medicine and a change from MCQs and SAQs to the new Single Best Answer Questions, which
are becoming more widely used by medical schools.
My hope is that this book will be of use to those beginning their medical education for forming the knowledge
base that they will need in medicine, while being a revision tool for those who are already further along in the process.

Ronan O’Neill
As a medical student, endocrinology can be a difficult subject to fathom. There are numerous intricate systems and
often complex terminologies that have to be understood and retained when studying. I hope that this edition of
Crash Course Endocrinology will provide you with a reliable, concise and readable source of information whether
you’re new to the topic or you simply need some reassurance the night before your finals exam. Good luck!

Richard Murphy

Faculty Advisors
We live in exciting times in the world of diabetes and endocrinology. Our understanding of the diseases as well as
our ability to manage the conditions have moved on enormously since the last edition of this book. Recent advances
in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the national guidelines around diabetes and endocrine conditions are all
updated for this edition. With these developments and the limitations of space this edition concentrates on
diabetes and endocrinology and old sections on pregnancy etc. have been dropped.
The two authors, both medical students, are to be congratulated on producing a guide to diabetes and
endocrinology that should find a place on every medical and nursing students bookshelf. They have produced a
book that provides not only informative text but also self-assessment questions to guide the learner.

Acknowledgements
I think it’s only fair that I start by thanking my partner in crime and co-author,
Mr Richard Murphy. He was willing to take on the ridiculous task of helping to
publish a medical textbook while still going through medical school.
I also want to thank Drs Weston and Ahmad who offered me this opportunity and
then gave me the space to get on with the work until I needed them.
The next big thank you is to my mum, dad, brothers and, of course, my dog Max.
They were there to encourage me the whole way with this book, which was at
times the bane of my life and I can’t thank them enough for it.
Now the acknowledgements get tricky, but in no particular order, I would like
to thank my friends in Liverpool. Renee and Lisa who at this very moment are
looking like a pair of zombies as we prepare for our exams. Also Asa and Fliss who
put up with my whinging throughout the year.
Finally I’d like to thank all these other people for being there for me when I needed
them. Brenndy Wright, Steve O’Hare, Tom, Paddy, Molly and everyone in the
Liverpool Wilderness Medicine Society.

Ronan O’Neill
I would like to thank Ronan for giving me the opportunity to co-author this
book. Special thanks to Verity, Jono and Owen for their continuous support and

Overview of the
endocrine system
ROLE OF THE ENDOCRINE
SYSTEM
The body requires a constant environment for cellular
activities to take place. This is achieved by homeostasis,
which is the process by which internal systems of
the body are maintained within optimum parameters
despite variations in external conditions. Homeostasis
in the human body is controlled by the endocrine system, which uses chemical messengers called hormones
to enable cellular communication and maintain this
constant environment. Hormones are therefore vital
in the coordination of virtually all body systems, both
short term and long term.
Some short-term effects of the endocrine system
include regulation of:
• Blood pressure
• pH of intracellular and extracellular fluids
• Respiration.
Some long-term effects include regulation of:
• Growth
• Reproduction
• Metabolism.

HORMONES AND ENDOCRINE
SECRETION

What is a hormone?
The main function of hormones is to enable cells to
communicate. There are five ways in which cells can
communicate via hormones (Fig. 1.1):
• Endocrine – hormones are produced by an endocrine gland and transmitted by the circulatory system to alter the structure or function on target cells
elsewhere in the body, e.g renin secreted by the
kidney.
• Paracrine – hormones are produced by endocrine
tissue and diffuse out of the cell to be transmitted
through extracellular fluid to alter the structure or
function of adjacent target cells. Distant cells are usually unaffected by paracrine hormones due to their
low levels in the blood, e.g clotting factors in the
blood.

1

• Autocrine – hormones are produced by a cell and act
locally on the same cell, e.g. cytokines such as interleukin-1.
• Neuroendocrine – hormones are produced by specialized nerve cells and secreted from the nerve endings into the circulation. This is the boundary
between the central nervous system and the endocrine system, e.g. oxytocin, ADH.
• Neurocrine – this does not strictly involve hormones but uses neurotransmitters to enable cell
communication, e.g. serotonin. It causes specific,
limited effects on target cells. There is some overlap
between neurotransmitters and hormones, e.g. noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) are known as neurotransmitters when
they cross synapses and hormones when there are released into the blood.

Types of hormone
Three classes of hormone are secreted into the blood:
• Polypeptides
• Steroids
• Modified amino acids.

Endocrine tissue
Endocrine tissue is simply tissue that secretes a hormone. These tissues respond to signals that either
stimulate or inhibit the release of the specific
hormone.

ORGANIZATION OF THE
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
The hypothalamus is an essential part of the endocrine
system. It provides a link between the brain (central nervous system) and the rest of the body, allowing the brain
to regulate body systems using hormones. The use of
hormones to control peripheral organs and tissues
allows a much wider range of effects compared to the
specific, local effects of neurocrine communication.
Hormones are required for coordinating long-term,
sustained activities of multiple cells, tissues and organs.

signals converge on hypothalamic cells to provide negative feedback to the hypothalamus so it can make the necessary inhibitory or stimulatory adjustments to maintain
homeostasis.

turn, relay messages back to the hypothalamus about
their effects and/or the levels of circulating hormones
in the blood, and this causes either stimulation or inhibition of hormone release by the hypothalamus
(Fig. 1.3). This is called negative feedback (Fig. 1.4).
The key to understanding the endocrine system is understanding that hormones produced by the hypothalamus alter the actions of peripheral endocrine tissues
which act to restore equilibrium in order to maintain a

The hypothalamus is a structure located in the base
of the forebrain. It converts neural signals received from
the brain into chemical signals in the form of hormones. These hormones cause the release of other hormones in the pituitary gland. For this reason, hormones
produced by the hypothalamus are known as ‘releasing
hormones’, e.g. thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (from
the hypothalamus) which causes the release of thyroxine in the pituitary gland. Releasing hormones therefore
act indirectly on peripheral target cells; their actions are
mediated through the release of pituitary hormones
which have a direct effect on target cells.
Hypothalamic activity is altered by homeostatic signals (e.g. osmolarity of the blood) and sensory information arriving from the periphery (e.g. blood pressure,
emotion). Hypothalamic hormones are released in a pulsatile manner, with regular changes in activity over the
course of 24 hours (circadian rhythm). This change in
activity over 24 hours corresponds to daily cycles of
daylight and darkness and alters physiological processes
such as body temperature, metabolic rate and blood
pressure.

Pituitary gland
The pituitary gland is found at the base of the brain, inferior to the hypothalamus. It releases hormones into
the blood in response to signals from the hypothalamus
known as ‘stimulating hormones’. Hormones from the
pituitary gland regulate the function of peripheral endocrine tissues throughout the body.

Peripheral endocrine tissues
These tissues respond to signals from the pituitary by
increasing or decreasing secretion of specific hormones
into the blood. It is the hormones secreted by these
peripheral tissues that affect the state of the body by
acting on target cells.

Target cells
All cells in the body will be exposed to the circulating
hormones in the blood. The cell will only respond to
the hormone, however, if it has the appropriate hormone
receptor. Cells that are the intended object of action of a
hormone are the hormone‘s target cell. There are multiple hormone receptors on every cell so the cell can

3

Overview of the endocrine system
respond to different hormones. Target cells in different
tissues may respond differently to the same hormone
depending on the presence of certain receptors.

Control of hormone secretion
Overall control
Endocrine tissues are regulated by signals from a variety
of neural and systemic sources. These signals are processed by cells to determine the rate of hormone secretion. The strength and importance of the signals varies
so that hormone secretion fits the needs of the body.
A single hormone may have multiple actions; equally,
multiple hormones may have the same action. This is
demonstrated by insulin and the regulation of blood
glucose, respectively.

What are the benefits of having
an endocrine system?
There are two main benefits to having an endocrine
system:

Amplification
Subtle but important neural signals are detected by the
hypothalamus, which then releases a small amount of
‘releasing hormone’. The pituitary gland is able to secrete a greater quantity of ‘stimulating hormone’, which
then stimulates the release of greater amounts of hormone by peripheral endocrine tissue. In this manner,
the signal of a small number of neurons in the hypothalamus is amplified in three stages to affect the entire
body.

Control

Neural control
Higher neural centres can influence the activity of the
endocrine system by acting on the hypothalamus. They
can increase or decrease the secretion of hypothalamic
releasing hormones, which regulate the secretion of
pituitary gland hormones. For example, cold external
temperature will stimulate TRH, ultimately increasing
metabolism in cells, raising body temperature.

Negative and positive feedback
A hormone is released in response to a stimulus. The actions of the hormone directly or indirectly reduce the intensity of the stimulus and restore equilibrium. Through
this mechanism, homeostasis is achieved. This is known
as negative feedback.
Hormones provide negative feedback:

Directly
The level of circulating hormones in the blood is
detected by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland and
subsequently altered, e.g. thyroxine levels are detected
by the hypothalamus.

Indirectly
The actions of the hormone produce physiological effects which are detected and subsequently altered by
the secretion of a hormone or hormones, e.g. low blood
glucose levels (hypoglycaemia).
Feedback can also be positive, where the effect produced by a hormone promotes the stimulus that caused
the release of the hormone. Positive feedback is not usually a homeostatic mechanism.

4

The endocrine system regulates all major body processes
that are essential for life. These processes must be controlled very tightly and kept within normal physiological ranges or else death may occur. The complexity of
the endocrine system allows such tight control and ensures the body can adapt and respond to any changes
rapidly.

HORMONE TYPES AND
SECRETION

Polypeptide hormones
Polypeptide hormones are proteins that act as hormones.
They cannot pass through cell membranes due to their
size and water-soluble nature. Protein hormones are
the most abundant type of hormone (a safe bet in an
exam). They are released by many structures including:
• Hypothalamus – TRH, GnRH, growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), etc.
• Pituitary – TSH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
luteinizing hormone (LH), oxytocin, etc.
• Pancreas and GI tract – insulin, glucagon, cholecystokinin (CCK), etc.

Synthesis and secretion
Polypeptide hormones are synthesized in the same
manner as all proteins. Some polypeptide hormones
undergo modification in the Golgi apparatus or secretory granules before secretion. Addition of carbohydrate
groups to form glycoproteins is quite common as are
cleavage reactions to free a smaller polypeptide hormone from the larger prohormone.

Steroids are derived from cholesterol by a series of reactions in the mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic
reticulum. Cholesterol is acquired from the diet or synthesized within cells; it is stored in the cytoplasm of
steroid cells (Fig. 1.5).
All steroids have the same basic structure formed by
four rings of carbon (Fig. 1.6), but individual hormones
differ in the following ways:
• Side chains attached to these rings
• Bonds within the rings (double or single).

mitochondria

Fig. 1.5 Appearance of a polypeptide-secreting cell and
steroid-secreting cell.

The secretory granules are released by exocytosis, in
which the membrane of the granule fuses with the
membrane of the cell causing the contents to be ejected.
This process is triggered by calcium entering the cell.
Polypeptide hormone release is controlled mainly by
regulating secretion of the hormone from the cell rather
than synthesis (Fig. 1.5).

Lipid-derived hormones
These are divided into two categories:
• Steroid hormones – derived from cholesterol.
• Eicosanoids – derived from arachidonic acid, a
phospholipid found in cell membranes.

Steroid hormones
Steroid hormones are small molecules that travel in the
blood bound to plasma proteins since they are fatsoluble. Their solubility means they can cross cell
membranes also. They are secreted by:
• Adrenal cortex – cortisol and aldosterone
• Ovaries – oestrogen and progesterone

The conversion of cholesterol into a steroid hormone is
a two-step pathway:

Step 1
Cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone by the desmolase enzyme found within the mitochondria of steroid-producing cells.

Step 2
Pregnenolone is converted to progesterone by enzymes
found in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. This reaction
involves:
• Isomerization – the double bond moves from ring B
to ring A.
• Oxidation – the hydroxyl group (OH) of ring A becomes a keto group (O).
Further steps are very variable, but the general pattern
is shown in Fig. 1.7.
Steroid hormones are released immediately after synthesis so the rate of release is determined by the rate of
synthesis, especially the synthesis of pregnenolone.

Eicosanoids
These are paracrine factors which regulate vital cell activities and enzymatic processes including immunity and
inflammation. Arachidonic acid is broken down by

and released by exocytosis in the same manner as polypeptide hormones. A comparison of the different types
of hormone can be found in Figure 1.8.

HORMONE RECEPTORS

Fig. 1.7 Basic structure of a steroid hormone.

Modified amino acids

Hormone receptors are highly specific and are able to
distinguish between hormones with very similar chemical structures. For example, testosterone and oestrogen
have profoundly different effects on cells but are chemically very similar.
In order for a hormone to exert its effects on a cell, a
hormone must interact with its appropriate receptor.
There are two methods by which the hormone can
interact with its receptor. This depends on whether
the hormone is lipid-soluble (lipid derivatives) or watersoluble (polypeptides, amino acids) and therefore its
ability to cross the cell membrane.

These are small water-soluble hormones that can cross
cell membranes.

• Water-soluble hormones, which are unable to cross
the cell membrane, use cell-surface receptors to exert

the enzyme phospholipase A2. Two pathways create different groups of eicosanoids:
• Cyclooxygenase pathway – forms prostaglandins
and thromboxanes
• Lipooxygenase pathway – forms leukotrienes.

their effect on the cell. They activate or inhibit
enzymes, which may affect protein synthesis.
• Lipid-soluble hormones, which are able to cross the
cell membrane, use intracellular receptors to exert
their effect on the cell, which usually involves control
of gene expression. Lipid-soluble hormones and their
intracellular receptors are utilized pharmaceutically
due to their ability to be absorbed from the GI tract.
Hormones that act via cell-surface receptors can
respond faster than those stimulating intracellular receptors because the activation of pre-existing enzymes
takes less time than synthesizing new proteins. This
explains why catecholamines released for the ‘fight-orflight’ response use cell-surface receptors even though
they can cross cell membranes.
A given hormone can have a different effect depending on the target cell and the receptor expressed on the
cell membrane. Additionally, the number of receptors
expressed by the cell can be increased or decreased to
alter the strength of the hormone. This is known as
‘up- and down-regulation’ and affords the cell a limited
degree of control, independent of circulating hormone
concentrations.
• When hormone levels fall and the cell requires more
of the hormone, the cell becomes more sensitive to
the hormone by increasing the number of hormone
receptors expressed. This is called up-regulation.
• When hormone levels rise and the cell requires
less of the hormone, the cell becomes less sensitive
by decreasing the number of hormone receptors
expressed. This is called down-regulation.
Additionally, the receptor itself can become desensitized to circulating hormones. This is mediated by the
hormone and involves phosphorylation of the receptor.
The action is reversible. An example of this is adrenaline; a sustained stimulus (e.g. sky-diving) will produce
a surge of catecholamines (e.g. adrenaline), which
causes an initial rush, which then decreases despite
the stimulus still being present.

Cell-surface receptors
Cell-surface receptors are utilized by polypeptide hormones and catecholamines. The receptor transmits the
signal into the cell where it can have an effect. The cellsurface receptor spans the whole cell membrane so it
has both an extracellular domain (for binding of hormones) and an intracellular domain (to allow the hormone signal to be relayed). This action is known as
signal transduction.
There are two types of cell-surface receptor involved
in the endocrine system:
• G-protein-coupled receptors (Fig. 1.9).
• Tyrosine kinase receptors (Fig. 1.10).

Overview of the endocrine system

Intracellular receptors
Hormones that readily cross the cell membrane, especially steroid hormones, use intracellular receptors.
The receptors stimulate protein synthesis directly so
they are also called transcription factors.
The hormone binds to the receptor in the cytoplasm,
causing a change in shape that activates the receptor.
The hormone and receptor then enter the nucleus where
they bind to specific sections of DNA, stimulating or inhibiting the transcription of particular genes. This action alters protein synthesis in the cell, bringing about the
intended effect of the hormone. This is shown in Fig. 1.11.

Neural control of hormones
The nervous system can control the endocrine system
through two routes:
• Hypothalamus
• Autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and
parasympathetic).
The endocrine system often acts as a long-term output
from the brain to complement the action of shortterm neural responses. This is demonstrated by the
three responses to stress listed in the order they take
effect:

RELATIONSHIP OF THE
NERVOUS AND ENDOCRINE
SYSTEMS

Integration
The nervous and endocrine systems have a very close relationship, since they both use chemical signals to communicate between cells, and they may share a common

evolutionary origin. The overlap between some hormones and neurotransmitters also supports this idea
(e.g. somatostatin is found in both systems). The close
relationship allows the two systems to coordinate
responses to maintain homeostasis.

• Noradrenaline is released from sympathetic
nerves.
• Preformed adrenaline is released from the adrenal
medulla.
• Cortisol is synthesized by the adrenal cortex.

Relationship of the nervous and endocrine systems

Hormonal control of neurons
To complete this circuit, the hormones of the endocrine
system also affect the nervous system. Negative feedback
to the hypothalamus has already been described. However, many hormones affect other areas of the brain, for
example:
•
•
•
•

Thyroid hormone deficiency causes depression.
Leptin and insulin regulate feelings of hunger.
Adrenaline increases mental activity.
Melatonin regulates the feeling of tiredness.

Comparison between the nervous
and endocrine systems
While the two systems function closely they have different modes of action. The hypothalamus combines these
actions since it is an endocrine tissue composed of nerve
cells called neurosecretory cells.
As endocrine hormones are very widespread in their
distribution, the manifestations of endocrine disease
vary greatly. Endocrine disease can be seen in patients
of all ages, from congenital abnormalities in newborns
through a plethora of adult and old-age endocrine
problems. Patients with cancer can have endocrine
dysfunction as part of the primary cancer (i.e. the
cancer releases a hormone) or as a side effect of

1

therapy. Endocrine disease can also occur in
patients with infections, including HIV. Increasingly,
associations are being demonstrated between
endocrine disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease. Therefore, the endocrine system is important
to understand as it plays a key role in many other
branches of medicine.

Nervous system
The nervous system uses very localized chemical signals
at synapses to transmit membrane depolarization between neurons. The effects of the nervous system are
very rapid but of short duration and expensive metabolically (i.e. the neurotransmitters and depolarization require a lot of energy). The specific target cell is
determined mostly by the location of chemical release
rather than the receptors.

Endocrine system
The endocrine system uses very generalized chemical
signals, though a few endocrine tissues can depolarize.
These signals require less energy than neural signals. The
signals travel throughout the body in the bloodstream,
and the target cell is determined mainly by the presence
and specificity of receptors. The signals of the endocrine
system tend to be slower but with a longer duration.

Describe the aetiology and clinical findings in SIADH.

The hypothalamic–pituitary axis is the central regulatory
component of the endocrine system, consolidating signals
from the brain, environmental stimuli and various feedback loops, adjusting output to meet changing demands.
The hypothalamus is sensitive to neural and hormonal stimuli. This information is then integrated by
the hypothalamus to generate chemical signals that relay the message on to the pituitary. The hypothalamus is
also sensitive to stimuli which affect hunger, thirst and
sexual behaviour; however, the output of these stimuli
is not the pituitary gland.
Hypothalamic-releasing and -inhibitory hormones
are carried in the hypophyseal portal vessels to the anterior pituitary, where they regulate the release of anterior pituitary hormones.
The posterior pituitary gland functions in a slightly
different way because it is a direct extension of the hypothalamus. Neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus
synthesize hormones that are transported along axons
that terminate in the posterior pituitary. These hormones are then released into capillaries within the posterior pituitary gland to affect body parts directly.

ANATOMY

Hypothalamus
The hypothalamus is situated at the base of the forebrain, the diencephalon. Together with the thalamus,
which is located superiorly, it forms the lateral walls
of the third ventricle. It is posterior and slightly superior
to the optic chiasm and anterior to the mamillary
bodies. The inferior part of the hypothalamus – called
the median eminence – gives rise to the pituitary stalk,
which is continuous with the posterior pituitary gland.

The base of the hypothalamus between the median eminence and mamillary bodies is known as the tuberal
area and contains nuclei which regulate pituitary gland
function. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.2.
The hypothalamus receives multiple inputs about
the homeostatic state of the body (Fig. 2.3). These arrive
by two means:
• Circulatory, e.g. temperature, blood glucose, hormone levels
• Neuronal, e.g. autonomic function, emotional.
The ability of the hypothalamus to respond to circulatory stimuli is due to numerous connections to circumventricular organs which surround the ventricles
of the brain. The hypothalamus also has extensive connections to sensory nuclei of the brainstem and limbic
system which further modulate its activity (Fig. 2.4).
It responds to these inputs by secreting hormones that
regulate the release of hormones from theanterior pituitary
or releases hormones directly from the posterior pituitary.
The hypothalamus is composed of several components:
• Mamillary bodies – regulate feeding reflexes (e.g.
swallowing) and memory
• Autonomic centres – control nuclei which alter heart
rate and blood pressure
• Supraoptic nucleus – secretes ADH
• Tuberal nuclei – control of anterior pituitary
• Preoptic areas – control of thermoregulation
• Paraventricular nucleus – secretes oxytocin
• Suprachiasmatic nucleus – controls circadian rhythm.

Pituitary gland
The pituitary gland lies in a bony hollow of the sphenoid (the sella turcica), and it is covered by the
fibrous diaphragma sellae. The optic chiasma lies directly

superior to the anterior pituitary. The posterior lobe is
connected to the median eminence of the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk (also known as the
infundibulum).
The pituitary gland is divided into two lobes with distinct embryological origins, structure and function:
• Anterior pituitary (also known as adenohypophysis)
• Posterior pituitary (also known as neurohypophysis).
The cavernous sinuses, including cranial nerves III–VI,
lie laterally (see Figs 2.1 and 2.2).

DEVELOPMENT

Hypothalamus
The hypothalamus develops from the embryological
forebrain, specifically the diencephalon. It can be identified at week 6 of gestation.

Pituitary gland
The pituitary gland has two embryological origins:

Blood supply
The superior hypophyseal arteries (branches of the
internal carotid) form a capillary plexus around the median eminence, supplying blood to the hypothalamus.
Hypothalamic hormones accumulate in the extracellular fluid at the median eminence before entering the
capillary plexus. From here they enter hypophyseal portal vessels forming a portal circulation between the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. The hypophyseal
portal vessels terminate in a second capillary plexus in
the anterior pituitary. This results in little dilution of hypothalamic hormones, allowing the pituitary to be
closely regulated by small amounts of hypothalamic
hormones. See Fig. 2.5.
The inferior hypophyseal arteries supply the posterior pituitary and do not communicate with the median
eminence.
The cavernous sinuses drain the pituitary gland. This is
how pituitary hormones enter the systemic circulation.

12

• The infundibulum of the diencephalon which
grows inferiorly. This is composed of neuroectoderm and forms the neurohypophysis. The neurohypophysis is therefore in direct communication
with the hypothalamus. Axons from neurosecretory
cells in the hypothalamus grow inferiorly into the
pituitary stalk and terminate in the posterior pituitary gland.
• An outgrowth of the primitive oral cavity known as
Rathke’s pouch, which grows superiorly. This is
composed of ectoderm and forms the adenohypophysis. The anterior pituitary is not in direct contact with the hypothalamus.
Rathke’s pouch is visible from the third week of gestation and eventually loses its connection with the oral
cavity and its blood supply at around the eighth week of
gestation; the blood supply to the anterior pituitary is
then replaced by hypothalamic portal vessels.
As the connection to the primitive mouth is lost,
nests of epithelial cells may be left behind. Occasionally

Soon after birth, the anterior pituitary gland begins
to secrete gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) at roughly
adult levels. Within 2 years, secretion declines rapidly
to very low levels that are maintained until puberty. Sexual maturation is halted at this point.

MICROSTRUCTURE

Hypothalamus
There are a number of different secretory neurons in the
hypothalamus (see p. ••), each specialized to secrete
specific hormones. Neurons that secrete the same hormones may be arranged in clusters called nuclei or they
may be scattered diffusely.

Anterior pituitary
The anterior pituitary is composed of cords of secretory
cells in a rich network of capillaries. Six types of secretory cell can be distinguished in the anterior pituitary
(Fig. 2.7). They are listed along with the hormone(s)
they secrete:
• Somatotrophs – growth hormone (GH)
• Gonadotrophs – luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
• Corticotrophs – adrenocorticotrophic hormone
(ACTH)

• Thyrotrophs – thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
• Lactotrophs – prolactin
• Chromophobes – inactive secretory cells.
The anterior pituitary can be further divided into three
parts, which have different secretory functions:
• Pars distalis: anterior portion of the adenohypophysis. This makes up the majority of the gland. It
secretes GH, LH, FSH, ACTH, TSH and prolactin.
• Pars intermedia: a thin layer of corticotroph cells
between the pars distalis and the posterior pituitary. It is poorly developed in humans. Secretes
melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) in the
fetus and during pregancy.
• Pars tuberalis: surrounds the pituitary stalk. Contains
a small number of mostly gonadotroph cells.

Posterior pituitary
The posterior pituitary can be divided into:
• Pars nervosa – majority of the posterior pituitary
• Pituitary stalk
• Median eminence.

The posterior pituitary is composed of two cell types but
it contains no secretory cells:
• Non-myelinated axons, originating from the
hypothalamus
• Pituicytes, which are glial support cells similar to
astrocytes.
Within the axons, there are microtubules and mitochondria that are involved in the transport of neurosecretory granules. These granules travel from the
hypothalamus to the axon terminals in the posterior
pituitary, where they are stored before release. The axon
terminals lie close to blood sinusoids, where the neurosecretory granules are released into the systemic circulation (Fig. 2.8).

HORMONES

Hormones of the hypothalamus
The hypothalamus secretes very small quantities of
hormones into the portal veins to exert control over
the anterior pituitary. By travelling in portal veins

16

directly to the anterior pituitary, their concentration
is high enough to produce an effect. The hypothalamic
hormones are often released in a pulsatile manner. The
pulses vary in amplitude and rate, often with a
circadian rhythm (see Chapter 6). Hormones that influence the anterior pituitary are secreted by short parvocellular neurons. Hypothalamic neurons that travel
directly to the posterior pituitary are magnocellular
neurons.

Hormones that regulate anterior
pituitary function
The hormones secreted by the hypothalamus are small
peptides, except for dopamine, which is derived from
the amino acid tyrosine. These hormones are shown
in Fig. 2.9, along with their effects.
They act on the secretory cells of the anterior
pituitary in an excitatory or inhibitory manner. Some
peptide hormones have more than one action on anterior pituitary secretion, e.g. TRH stimulates prolactin
release as well as TSH release.

• Supraoptic nucleus
• Paraventricular nucleus.
Both nuclei secrete both hormones, but the supraoptic
nucleus tends to secrete more ADH, whereas the paraventricular nucleus secretes more oxytocin. The hormones pass along the axons bound to glycoproteins.
They pass through the median eminence where they
are then stored before release.

Hormones of the anterior
pituitary
The hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary are
large peptides or glycopeptides. They are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Growth hormone (GH)
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
Luteinizing hormone (LH)
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
Prolactin (PRL).

The hormones synthesized by the anterior pituitary are
released into the systemic circulation (Fig. 2.10).
They act in two ways:
• Regulation of other endocrine organs – TSH, ACTH,
GH, LH and FSH
• Direct effects on distant organs – prolactin.
The pars intermedia of the anterior pituitary also secretes:
• a-MSH and g-MSH, which stimulate melanocytes in
skin in human fetal life and during pregnancy. Patients with high ACTH are hyperpigmented but it is
unclear whether this is due to increased production
of MSH or the melanotropic activity of ACTH.
• b-Endorphin, an endogenous opioid, which acts as a
neurotransmitter and may have a role in the control
of pain.

prolactin from the pituitary. This is important clinically
if a tumour stops hypothalamic hormones from reaching the anterior pituitary. The levels of most pituitary
hormones will fall, while levels of prolactin levels will
rise. The use of dopamine antagonists in the treatment
of psychiatric conditions commonly causes this effect
also, causing galactorrhoea.
The hormones of the anterior pituitary can be
remembered using the mnemonic ‘Fresh Pituitary
Tastes Almost Like Guinness’.

HORMONAL FEEDBACK
Hormones exert both positive and negative feedback on
the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus then secretes
releasing factors and inhibiting factors which affect
pituitary hormone release. The pituitary gland also
responds to feedback from circulating hormones and
paracrine and autocrine secretions.
Hypothalamic regulation of prolactin release is
unique because its action is inhibitory: dopamine secreted from the hypothalamus inhibits release of

18

Hormones of the posterior
pituitary
Two major hormones are synthesized in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary into the systemic circulation:
• Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called arginine
vasopressin (AVP)
• Oxytocin.

vasopressin. Low blood volume detected by peripheral
baroreceptors stimulates very high ADH release to
increase blood pressure.
• V1A receptors are expressed by vascular smooth
muscle and cause ADH’s vasoconstrictive action.
• V2 receptors are expressed on the basolateral membrane of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting
ducts of the kidney and are responsible for the hormone’s antidiuretic effect.
A small proportion of ADH is released into the portal
veins, where it stimulates corticotrophs in the anterior
pituitary to secrete ACTH. This action is mediated via
the V1B receptor (formerly known as V3 receptor).

(approx. 1 in 50 000). They tend to cause deficiency
of hypothalamic hormones and the corresponding pituitary hormones. Often, disorders of the hypothalamus
can mimic pituitary pathology; however, the important
distinction is that hypothalamic pathology often causes
decreased secretion of most hormones but may cause
increased secretion of some hormones, e.g. prolactin,
as it is under inhibitory control by the hypothalamus.

19

The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland
The main causes of hypothalamic disorders are listed
below:
• Trauma/surgery
• Radiotherapy
• Hormone excess – Syndrome of inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), disconnection
hyperprolactinaemia
• Hormone deficiency – Cranial diabetes insipidus, congenital gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
deficiency (Kallmann’s syndrome) causing infertility,
congenital GHRH deficiency causing dwarfism
• Primary glial tumours of the hypothalamus.
Lesions in the hypothalamus can cause many other
abnormalities including disorders of consciousness,
behaviour, thirst, satiety and temperature regulation.
In addition to endocrine abnormalities, pituitary tumours
can present with the effects of a space-occupying lesion.
These include headaches from stretching of the dura
mater. Paradoxically, pituitary tumours can cause
panhypopituitarism due to compression of functioning
cells. Tumours of the pituitary gland are surrounded by
the bone of the sella turcica, so they can only expand
upwards into the optic chiasma, causing visual field
defects. Further expansion compresses cranial nerves III,
IV, V and VI in the wall of the cavernous sinus.

DISORDERS OF THE ANTERIOR
PITUITARY
These can be grouped in a similar way to hypothalamic
disorders:
• Hormone excess – Prolactin, GH (acromegaly),
ACTH (Cushing’s disease). These are most commonly due to benign tumours of the secretory cells
called pituitary adenomas. TSH, LH and FSH adenomas are rare. Functioning adenomas usually present
whilst small and cause disease by excess hormone
release.
• Hormone deficiency – Hypopituitarism or compression by a space-occupying lesion (e.g. adenoma).
Non-functioning adenomas usually present later as
a macroadenoma and cause disease by compressing
surrounding structures. This frequently causes insufficient pituitary hormone release either by compression of the portal vessels or secretory cells.

• Hormone hypo- or hypersecretion due to compression
• Amenorrhoea and/or loss of libido.

Hyperpituitarism
All anterior pituitary cells are capable of becoming neoplastic (Fig. 2.14). They are usually classified according
to their location, size and invasiveness:
• Microadenomas – tend to be intrasellar and are
< 10 mm in diameter. These are more common than
macroadenomas.
• Macroadenomas – are >10 mm in diameter and
tend to compress adjacent structures.
Between 10 and 20% of the population have pituitary
microadenomas, which are clinically silent.

Prolactinomas
Prolactinomas are the most common functioning adenoma of the anterior pituitary gland. They are more
common in women and tend to present early, with oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea and infertility. Galactorrhoea may occur as a result of excess prolactin
secretion by the adenoma.
Prolactinomas may present differently in men, with
erectile dysfunction, visual field defects and headache
(Fig. 2.15).
Hyperprolactinaemia may also be caused by some
medications.
Infertility is the result of prolactin interfering with
the release of GnRH, which inhibits LH and FSH release
and causes hypogonadism.
Prolactin-secreting adenomas are the most common
type of functioning adenoma and secrete excess
prolactin by definition. Hyperprolactinaemia and
galactorrhoea can also be caused by dopamine
antagonists used to treat patients with movement
disorders. Furthermore, renal failure can be
associated with hyperprolactinaemia due to
impaired prolactin secretion. Non-functioning
adenomas can also produce hyperprolactinaemia
by removing dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin
release.

Investigations

Pituitary tumours can present in a number of ways:

A number of symptoms and investigations are assessed
to achieve a diagnosis:

• Headache and visual disturbance from compression
• Inappropriate hormone secretion, e.g. prolactin
(hyperprolactinaemia), ACTH (Cushing’s disease),
GH (acromegaly)

• Visual field assessment is carried out to detect compression of the optic chiasma which presents as
bitemporal hemianopia. Diplopia may also be present as a result of cavernous sinus involvement.

20

Disorders of the anterior pituitary
Are there abnormal hormone levels in the blood? Serum levels of the following hormones should be analysed, ideally in the morning, as this will give you a
clinical picture of what pathology is under way:
•
•
•
•
•

Prolactin
TSH and thyroxine
Insulin-like growth factor 1
FSH, LH and levels of oestrogen/testosterone
ACTH and cortisol.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans are used to detect abnormal anatomy. Radiolabelled dopamine receptor antagonists can
also aid visualization of prolactinomas.
Suppression tests may also be carried out to assess pituitary response to hormone analogues or inhibiting
factors to locate the lesion on the endocrine axis. Generally, adenomas display reduced negative feedback.
Suppression tests are used to determine if anterior pituitary secretion is still controlled by negative feedback.
The main suppression tests for anterior pituitary
levels are to measure:
• GH in response to an oral glucose tolerance test,
which normally suppresses GH levels
• ACTH in response to dexamethasone, a steroid that
normally suppresses CRH and ACTH release.

Treatment
There are four methods of treating excess hormone
production, but they all carry the risk of causing
hypopituitarism:
• Bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) to reduce prolactin secretion
• Octreotide (synthetic somatostatin) to reduce GH
secretion
• Surgical removal of pituitary adenoma
• Irradiation to prevent adenoma recurrence.
Surgery on the pituitary gland is indicated when the lesion is causing compression of surrounding structures
or when medical treatment has been unsuccessful.
Irradiation is indicated for persistent hypersecretion of pituitary hormones, or when surgery is
contraindicated.

2

Non-functioning adenomas
These are the most common type of pituitary tumour
and do not produce hormones. They are most commonly non-functioning gonadotroph cells. Since there
is no excess hormone production they usually present
late with symptoms caused by compression of surrounding structures. Symptoms are usually progressive:
• Headache, vomiting and papilloedema due to raised
intracranial pressure
• Visual disturbance
• Oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women
• Reduced libido and infertility in men
• Cranial nerve palsies.
The tumour can cause hormone deficiencies by direct
compression of the secretory cells or by compressing
the portal veins that bring the hypothalamic-releasing
factors. Secretion of anterior pituitary hormones is
inhibited in a characteristic order: GH, LH, FSH, ACTH,
TSH, prolactin (see Fig. 2.13). Unless the compression is
severe, prolactin secretion often increases (see p. ••).

Other tumours
Tumours in surrounding tissues can also compress the
pituitary gland, causing hypopituitarism, the most common being:
•
•
•
•

Craniopharyngiomas
Gliomas (especially in the optic chiasm)
Meningiomas
Metastases (particularly from breast, bronchus and
kidney).

Craniopharyngiomas are tumours arising from remnants of Rathke’s pouch. Occasionally they are functional and secrete ectopic hormones but they are
usually benign. They are rare but are the most common
intracranial tumour affecting children. Hypothalamic
symptoms predominate and can be varied. Children
usually present with growth failure.
Gliomas are primary tumours of the glial support cells.
Meningiomas are formed from arachnoid and
meningioendothelial cells. They are usually highly vascular and consequently carry a high risk of haemorrhage
during surgery.

Infarction of the pituitary gland
Hypopituitarism
Pituitary insufficiency (hypopituitarism) often presents
with insidious-onset depression, tiredness and hypogonadism. Panhypopituitarism refers to a deficiency of all
anterior pituitary hormones. The causes of pituitary insufficiency are more varied than those of hyperpituitarism. However, the most common cause is treatment
of hyperpituitarism.

Infarction of the pituitary gland causes necrosis of all
secretory cells with resultant panhypopituitarism, including loss of prolactin secretion. Sheehan’s syndrome
is a rare cause of pituitary infarction, which is caused by
hypotension and/or hypovolaemic shock during obstetric haemorrhage. The pituitary gland enlarges during
pregnancy and becomes highly vascular as a result;
therefore it is particularly susceptible to hypotension
and hypoxia. The ensuing panhypopituitarism causes

Pituitary apoplexy is a rare endocrine emergency
which is caused by infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumour. The most common precipitants of pituitary apoplexy are hypertension and major surgery.
Patients typically present with the following:
• Sudden-onset severe headache (thunderclap). This is
classically retro-orbital

22

• Nausea, vomiting and decreased conscious level
• Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis or weakness of one or
more extraocular muscles)
• Sudden severe visual impairment or loss. Bitemporal
hemianopia is the most common visual field defect
seen.
These signs and symptoms are usually followed by a deficiency of one or more anterior pituitary hormones.

To counteract haemodynamic instability, high-dose
IV hydrocortisone should be given. Transsphenoidal
surgical decompression should be performed within
one week and is generally reserved for patients with:
• Severe neuro-ophthalmic signs
• Deteriorating conscious level.

Compression of the pituitary
gland
Empty sella syndrome is a condition where the sella turcica partially or completely fills with cerebrospinal
fluid. The majority of patients have no associated pituitary problems, but it may cause pituitary compression,
which could lead to pituitary insufficiency. It is not always pathological.

Other causes of pituitary failure
Pituitary failure can also be caused by inflammatory/infiltrative processes, e.g. sarcoidosis, lymphocytic hypophysitis, haemochromatosis and infective processes,
e.g. TB and syphilis.

Diagnosis of hypopituitarism
Diagnosis of hypopituitarism involves the same steps
as for hyperpituitarism; however, stimulation tests are
used instead of suppression:
•
•
•
•

Visual field assessment
Basal hormone levels in the blood
Stimulation tests
MRI or CT scan.

The main stimulation tests for anterior pituitary
levels are to measure:
• GH in response to an insulin tolerance test, which
normally increases GH levels
• Cortisol in response to hypoglycaemia or the ACTH
analogue Synacthen
• LH and FSH in response to GnRH or the antioestrogen clomifene.

Treatment of hypopituitarism
The main treatment of hypopituitarism is hormone replacement, which requires frequent monitoring. All
major anterior pituitary hormones can be replaced,
though prolactin is not readily available since it is
rarely needed:
• Subcutaneous GH replacement using human recombinant GH. This is only indicated for severe GH deficiency which is severely affecting the patient’s
quality of life
• Oral thyroxine once cortisol replacement has begun

• Oral or intramuscular testosterone in males

DISORDERS OF THE POSTERIOR
PITUITARY

Diabetes insipidus
Diabetes insipidus is the name for the pathological state
in which large amounts of hypotonic, dilute urine are
passed (polyuria). This leads to excessive thirst (polydipsia). It is due to either a deficiency of ADH secretion
(cranial diabetes insipidus), or an inappropriate renal
response to ADH (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). As
a result, fluid reabsorption at the kidneys is impaired
causing the characteristic signs and symptoms. Up to
20 litres of water can be passed in a day, causing potentially fatal dehydration (particularly in unconscious patients) and persistent thirst.
Diabetes insipidus is often diagnosed according to
the clinical history in addition to elevated plasma osmolality (>300 mOsm/kg), and low urine osmolality
(< 600 mOsm/kg).
Hyperglycaemia, hypercalcaemia and hypokalaemia
should be ruled out.
An ADH stimulation test is used to distinguish between cranial diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus:
• Cranial diabetes insipidus is illustrated by an inability to concentrate urine after fluid restriction alone,
but the ability to concentrate urine after administration of ADH.
• Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus shows an inability
to concentrate urine even after administration
of ADH.

the end of this chapter you should be able to:
Explain the structure and development of the thyroid gland
Describe the synthesis of thyroid hormones
Understand the regulation and physiological effects of thyroid hormones
Discuss the major disorders associated with thyroid function.

The thyroid gland is the largest endocrine organ in the
body and is tasked with regulating the metabolism of
most of the body’s cells. It also plays a vital role in
the development of the nervous and skeletal systems.
The gland is located anterior to the trachea on the lower
aspect of the neck and is composed of two lobes joined
by a piece of tissue called the ‘isthmus’.
The gland contains a large store of preformed thyroid
hormones arranged in microscopic spherical sacs called
thyroid follicles. It also acts as a large iodine store, as the
production of thyroid hormones is dependent on adequate iodine being available. The release of thyroid hormones (Fig. 3.1) is regulated by the anterior pituitary
gland, which secretes thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH). The two hormones secreted by the follicles are:
• T4 – a prohormone that acts as a plasma reservoir
• T3 – the active hormone.
Hyperthyroidism is the excessive release of thyroid hormones resulting in an abnormally raised metabolism.
This classically presents with the patient feeling hot
and sweaty and complaining of unexplained weight loss.
Hypothyroidism is the deficient release of thyroid
hormone resulting in an abnormally low metabolism.
The patient will complain of feeling lethargic and cold,
with unexplained weight gain.

ANATOMY

Thyroid gland
The thyroid gland is butterfly-shaped and located inferior to the larynx and cricoids cartilage. It has two pyramidal-shaped lateral lobes, approximately 5 cm in long,
joined by the narrower isthmus anterior to the trachea.
It is usually located over the second and third tracheal
cartilages (Fig. 3.2).
The thyroid is attached to the trachea by the pretracheal fascia (Fig. 3.3) so that it moves with the trachea

and larynx when swallowing but not when the tongue is
protruded. The thyroid is covered by a fibrous capsule
within the fascia.

Blood, nerves and lymphatics
The thyroid is highly vascularized, receiving 80–120 mL
of blood per minute. The vascular supply to the thyroid
comes from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries;
however, a small percentage of people have a third artery
that supplies the isthmus, called the thyroid ima artery.
1. The superior thyroid artery is the first branch of the
external carotid artery and it descends to the superior point of the gland’s lateral lobe. When it reaches
the gland, the artery divides into the anterior and
posterior glandular branches. The anterior glandular branch passes along the superior border of the
gland and anastomoses with its twin from the opposite side. The posterior glandular branch passes to
the posterior side of the gland.
2. The inferior thyroid artery is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk that arises from the first part of the subclavian artery. It ascends passing posterior to the carotid
sheath, and reaches the lateral lobe of the gland at the
inferior pole. The inferior thyroid artery divides into
two branches, the inferior branch and ascending
branch. The inferior branch supplies the lower part
of the thyroid gland and anastomoses with the posterior branch of the superior thyroid artery. The ascending branch supplies the parathyroid glands.
3. The thyroid ima artery is small and not always present. It can arise from two possible locations, the
arch of the aorta or the brachiocephalic trunk, from
which it ascends to the anterior surface of the trachea to supply the thyroid gland.
The thyroid gland is drained by three veins:

• The middle and inferior thyroid veins, which drain
the rest of thyroid gland.
The superior and middle thyroid veins drain into the
internal jugular vein and the inferior thyroid vein drains
into the brachiocephalic vein.
Thyroid lymphatics drain into four groups of nodes:
•
•
•
•

Prelaryngeal lymph nodes
Pretracheal lymph nodes
Paratracheal lymph nodes
Deep cervical lymph nodes.

Parathyroid glands
The parathyroid glands are two pairs of small, oval
structures approximately 5 mm in diameter, one pair located on the posterior surface of each lobe. The glands
are designated as the inferior and superior pairs.

26

However, it is important to note that the number of
glands can vary, as can their location. The function of
the parathyroid glands is described in Chapter 8.

MICROSTRUCTURE

Thyroid gland
The thyroid is composed of approximately one million
microscopic spherical follicles. The wall of each follicle
is made up primarily of epithelial cells, called follicular
cells. These cells surround and extend into a colloidfilled space. The follicular cells secrete thyroglobin, a
storage form of thyroid hormone, into the colloid.
When the follicular cells are not actively secreting hormones, their shape is low cuboidal to squamous, but
when under the influence of TSH they become cuboidal
or low columnar and actively secrete hormones. The
colloid store and follicles increase in size when they
are not carrying out active secretion of hormones.
When the follicular cells are in an active secretory
phase, microvilli form on their inner surface and thyroglobin is absorbed. This results in the colloid store
shrinking in size. The thyroglobin is broken down in
the cell and released as thyroid hormone. The histology
of the thyroid gland is shown in Fig. 3.4.
Another type of secretory cell is located on the follicles, within the basement membrane that surrounds the
follicles. These are called parafollicular cells (C cells),
which synthesize and secrete calcitonin.

Fig. 3.4 Histology of the thyroid gland.

The thyroid develops in the fourth week as a midventral
outgrowth of endoderm from the floor of the pharynx,
named the thyroid diverticulum. It moves inferiorly
into the neck and differentiates into the lateral lobes
and isthmus of the thyroid gland. The gland remains attached to the tongue by the thyroglossal duct.
Approximately half the population have a remnant
of this duct, in the form of a small pyramidal lobe that
extends superiorly from the isthmus. This is important
because thyroglossal cysts can form anywhere along
the thyroid’s course, presenting as neck lumps that rise
when the tongue is protruded.

Parathyroid gland
The parathyroid glands develop from the endoderm, at
the level of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches.
The dorsal portion of the third pouch forms the inferior
parathyroid glands, while the superior pair of glands are
formed by the dorsal portion of the fourth pouch.

Parathyroid glands
The parathyroid glands are composed of two types of
epithelial cells:
• Chief (principal) cells – synthesize parathyroid
hormone (PTH), also known as parathormone
• Oxyphil cells – exhausted chief cells that
increase in number with age. They have no known
function.

THYROID HORMONES
The thyroid gland is unique amongst the endocrine
glands because it stores large quantities of its secretory
product (approximately 100 days worth). This means
that deficiency can take a while to present clinically.

27

The thyroid gland
Three hormones are synthesized and secreted in the
gland:

Iodide oxidation

• Thyroxine (T4)
• Tri-iodothyronine (T3)
• Calcitonin.

• Iodide is rapidly oxidized to iodine (I2) by hydrogen
peroxide, a reaction catalysed by a haem-containing
enzyme, thyroid peroxidase (TPO). TPO is located
on the luminal surface of follicular cell membrane.

Calcitonin is involved in calcium homeostasis and is
discussed in Chapter 8.

The two components are then combined in the colloidal lumen.

Synthesis

Iodination of thyroglobulin

T3 and T4 are derived from two molecules of the
amino acid and iodine. T3 contains three iodine
atoms and T4 contains four. There structures are
shown in Fig. 3.5.
The synthesis of thyroid hormones occurs in the follicle lumen. The process of T3 and T4 synthesis involves
the processing of tyrosine and iodine, followed by a reaction to bind them together. These steps are shown in
Fig. 3.6.
Tyrosine processing is relatively simple since tyrosine
molecules are already within the cell.

• Reactive iodine rapidly attaches to the tyrosine molecules within the extracellular thyroglobulin. The reaction is catalysed by TPO, and monoiodotyrosine
(MIT or T1) and diiodotyrosine (DIT or T2) are
formed.

Thyroglobulin synthesis
• Tyrosine is converted into the glycoprotein thyroglobulin, which contains approximately 110 tyrosine residues.
The processing of iodine involves two stages as plasma
iodine concentrations are very low.

Iodine trapping
• Plasma iodide ions (I) are actively transported from
the plasma into the follicular cells against a steep concentration gradient. This is a rate-limiting step.

Coupling
• Once tyrosine is iodinated, it is taken up into the
thyroglobulin colloid of the follicle and coupled
together. Combinations of T1 and T2 can form thyroid hormones:
• T3 (tri-iodothyronine) is made from T1þ T2
• T4 (tetra-iodothyronine or thyroxine) is made
from T2þT2.
Only a small proportion of coupling reactions form
T3 and T4. Thyroid hormones are now available for release on demand.

Secretion
This is controlled by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH
or thyrotrophin). Under the influence of TSH, iodinated
thyroglobulin is taken into the follicular cells by pinocytosis. This fuses with lysosomes, resulting in hydrolysis
of the thyroglobulin and release of coupled tyrosine
molecules (e.g. T3 and T4). Around 10% of T4 is converted to T3 in the follicular cell cytoplasm by deiodinase
enzymes. Ninety per cent of thyroid hormones are secreted in the form of T4 with the remainder as T3.
Eighty per cent of the T4 is converted to the more
active T3 (under the stimulation of TSH) in the liver
and kidney or to reverse T3 (rT3) that has little or no biological activity. MIT and DIT are also released, but they
are deiodinated by iodotyrosine dehalogenase to recycle
iodine.

Iodine metabolism
Iodine is acquired from the diet mainly from iodized
salt, meat and vegetables. About 150 mg of iodine is
needed per day, though only a fraction of this is
absorbed. The thyroid gland cells are the only cells
that can actively absorb and utilize plasma iodine;
a considerable quantity of iodine is stored in the

thyroid as preformed thyroid hormones. Iodine is
returned to the plasma by the breakdown of these thyroid hormones. Iodine is excreted mainly via the
kidneys.
Thiacarbimide drugs, such as carbimazole, used
in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, inhibit thyroid
peroxidase. This inhibition results in decreased
oxidation of iodide, decreased iodination of
iodides and ultimately reduced thyroid hormone
production.

Regulation
Thyroid activity is controlled by the hypothalamus
and anterior pituitary. Hypothalamic thyrotrophinreleasing hormone (TRH) is released into the hypophyseal portal blood and this stimulates the release of
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotrophin)
from the anterior pituitary gland. This happens in
response to several things, including low thyroid hormone levels, cold, pregnancy, etc. TSH acts on extracellular receptors on the surface of thyroid follicle cells.
Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is formed and this stimulates five
of the stages of synthesis and secretion:
• Iodine uptake
• Thyroglobulin synthesis
• Iodination

• Coupling
• Pinocytosis for secretion.
As a result, T3 and T4 are synthesized and secreted more
rapidly. TSH also has long-term actions on the thyroid
gland by increasing its size and vascularity to improve
hormone synthesis.
A number of factors affect thyroid hormone release.
Three main factors stimulate secretion:
• Long-term exposure to cold temperatures acting on
the anterior pituitary
• Oestrogens acting on the anterior pituitary
• Adrenaline (epinephrine) acting directly on the thyroid gland.
A negative feedback loop exists to partly maintain
temperature homeostasis and circulating levels of T3
and T4. TSH secretion is inhibited by raised serum levels
of thyroid hormones, as well as somatostatin, glucocorticoids and chronic illness. The regulatory effect comes
from thyroid hormones acting on the pituitary receptors
to TRH as opposed to reducing TRH secretion from
the hypothalamus. High levels of iodine also suppress
secretion of thyroid hormones.

Transport of thyroid hormones
Most of the thyroid hormones in the blood are bound to
plasma proteins produced within the liver, which allows them to circulate without being broken down by
enzymes. The transport is also necessary as T3 and T4

29

The thyroid gland
are lipophilic molecules, meaning that they will not
readily dissolve in the blood.
• 70% are bound to thyroid-binding globulin (TBG)
• 30% are bound to albumin.

by increasing or decreasing T3 synthesis. T4 is converted
to T3 by deiodination, i.e. removal of one iodine atom
catalysed by deiodinase enzymes. Two main forms of
this enzyme have been found:

Only a fraction of the circulating thyroid hormones
(0.1% of T4 and 1% of T3) is unbound/free and biologically active. Bound hormone cannot diffuse into the
body’s cells.

• Type 1 – found on the cell surface in most tissues. It
raises local T3.
• Type 2 – intracellular enzymes that raise cellular T3 in
the central nervous system (CNS) and pituitary gland.

Actions
Thyroid hormones are responsible in part for the expression of genes in target cells. They are mediated by the
same receptors as all steroid hormones (Chapter 1);
however, thyroid hormone receptors are found in the
nucleus, not the cytoplasm. Fig. 3.7 shows some of
the differences between T3 and T4. T4 is a relatively inactive, stable molecule that can be thought of as a prohormone and provides a reservoir for the more active T3. T3
is found in a higher percentage of active hormone than
T4 and has a greater effect on receptors. The benefit to
the production of two hormones is that T4 can maintain
a background level of activity whilst T3 levels can adapt
quickly to changing environments.
Peripheral tissues and organs, e.g. the liver, spleen
and kidneys, have the ability to regulate local T3 levels

A further deiodinase enzyme can remove a different iodine molecule from T4 to form reverse T3 (rT3). This is
an inactive molecule that binds to the receptor sites in
the nucleus and blocks the actions of T3. Excess rT3
can lead to a condition called reverse T3 syndrome. RT3
is produced in larger quantities when energy stores
are low or in periods of illness, so as to conserve energy.
In general, T3 promotes energy production in every
cell in the body by increasing the size and number of mitochondria. This causes heat production and maintains
metabolism. Fig. 3.8 shows the intracellular actions of T3.

Feedback
T3 receptors are also found in the pituitary gland and the
hypothalamus, where they inhibit transcription of
the gene for TRH prohormone and the release of TSH,
respectively. Excess T3 inhibits TSH release while a deficiency of T3 stimulates TSH release. This feedback mechanism helps maintain T3 levels, and therefore stabilizes
metabolic rate.

DISORDERS OF THE THYROID
GLAND
The thyroid gland is prone to a number of diseases that
can alter its function and structure. These diseases frequently have wide-ranging systemic effects because

Disorders of the thyroid gland
thyroid hormones regulate the metabolism of almost every cell in the body. The main categories of disease are:
• Hyperthyroidism – excess of thyroid hormone
production
• Hypothyroidism – deficiency of thyroid hormone
production
• Goitre formation
• Adenoma (benign growths) of the thyroid
• Carcinoma.
Clinical examination and findings of thyroid disorders
are discussed later in the chapter.

Hyperthyroidism
This can be defined as ‘overactivity of the thyroid gland,
either due to a tumour, overgrowth of the gland, or Graves’
disease’ that can lead to an excess of thyroid hormone
secretion. When this becomes symptomatic, it causes a
condition known as thyrotoxicosis. This is a common endocrine disorder affecting two in 100 women and two in
1000 men and can develop at any age. Hyperthyroidism
can present in a number of ways, with some variation
depending on the underlying cause. These are shown in
Fig. 3.9.
The classic presentation is usually a gradual weight
loss despite increased appetite (NB there as a paradoxical weight gain in 10–30% of cases).
An acute exacerbation of symptoms can be called a
few names that are all very similar, including thyroid
storm or thyrotoxic storm. This is commonly precipitated
by recent thyroid surgery (damaged follicles releasing
their contents), infection, myocardial infarctions, etc.,
and is considered to be a medical emergency requiring
immediate treatment by an experienced endocrinologist.
The main causes of hyperthyroidism are:
• Graves’ disease – an autoimmune disease
• Toxic mulitnodular goitre – nodules develop that
secrete thyroid hormones, most commonly seen in
elderly patients and in populations where iodine
intake is too low.
• Toxic adenoma – a benign growth that secretes T3
and T4.
Additional (and rarer) causes include subacute
(de Quervain’s) thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue,
drugs, e.g. amiodarone or thyroxine, overdose.

Diagnosis
Thyroid function tests are the main method of diagnosis. Serum TSH, free T3 and free T4 are measured by
radioimmunoassay (RIA). Elevated T3 and T4 levels
indicate hyperthyroidism is present. Raised TSH
suggests the fault lies in or above the pituitary gland,
whereas low TSH points to a thyroid organ disorder.

• Radioisotope scanning to show the size of the thyroid gland and any abnormal ‘hot’ areas such as a
toxic adenoma
• ECG to check for sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (as a result of excess thyroid hormones).

Treatment
Treatment varies depending on the cause of the hyperthyroidism and requires specialist monitoring and

31

The thyroid gland
control in infancy and pregnancy. The main treatments,
however, can be divided into three methods:
1. Drug therapy: b-blockers for rapid symptomatic
control, e.g. palpitations, anxiety.
Carbimazole inhibits the peroxidase reactions of
T3 and T4 synthesis but can take around a month
to have a marked effect. Some physicians use a
block–replace method, i.e. treat with carbimazole
and thyroxine simultaneously to avoid risk of
iatrogenic hypothyroidism.
2. Radioiodine (131I): 131I is only absorbed by the thyroid tissue, killing the cells and reducing thyroid
hormone synthesis. The response is slow and carbimazole may still be required.
3. Partial thyroidectomy: The thyroid gland is removed
surgically leaving some tissue and the parathyroid
glands.
Both radioiodine and partial thyroidectomy run the
risk of long-term hypothyroidism as the remaining
thyroid tissue may not be sufficient to meet the body’s
demands, especially with increasing age. Their treatment
is described under hypothyroidism.

Graves’ disease
Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disease, in which autoantibodies against the TSH receptors are produced.
These antibodies stimulate the TSH receptors and lead
to an excess production of thyroid hormones. Autoantibodies to thyroglobulin and to the thyroid hormones
may also be produced. Graves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis; and
is especially common in middle-aged women (♀:♂,
8:1). There is a genetic association with the human leucocyte antigen (HLA).
The disease itself follows either a relapsing–remitting
course or one with fluctuating severity. Graves’ can lead
to hypothyroidism in some rare cases.
Classically, Graves’ disease presents with a ‘staring’
appearance (exophthalmos), a goitre (with bruit) and
swollen legs (pretibial myxoedema).
Graves’ ophthalmopathy is caused by lymphocytic
infiltration of the periorbital tissues and activation of fibroblasts to secrete osmotically active hyaluronic acid.
This increases the pressure and pushes the eye forward,
resulting in proptosis. This pressure change also causes
muscle fibrosis and diplopia due to weakening of the
extraocular muscles. Corneal ulcers are also important
to be aware of and inflammation can cause optic nerve
compression. The eye disease may precede the onset of
thyroid dysfunction, and does not respond to correction
of thyroid status. Treatment involves radiotherapy and
surgery.
Graves’ disease is diagnosed by detection of autoantibodies along with low TSH and raised T4 and/or T3.

32

The thyroid autoantibodies, thyroglobulin antibody
(TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody, are present in both Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. However, thyroid receptor antibody (TRAb) or
thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) antibodies are specific to Graves’ disease. The treatment is
consistent with other causes of hyperthyroidism, but radioactive iodine and surgery are especially likely to
cause hypothyroidism.

Thyroid hormone resistance
syndrome
This is a rare condition that occurs due to a mutation in
one of the thyroid receptor genes. In most cases the
raised levels of T3 and T4 compensate for the resistance,
but ‘generalized resistance’ can present with congenital
hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is defined as an underactive thyroid
gland leading to deficient thyroid hormones (T3
and T4). When this becomes symptomatic, it is called
myxoedema. It is slightly less common than hyperthyroidism, affecting 1/100 females and 1/500 males. The
symptoms and signs of myxoedema are illustrated in
Fig. 3.10. Presentation is even more gradual than hyperthyroidism, many symptoms frequently being ignored.
Thyroid hormones are essential between birth
and puberty for the normal development of the CNS.
Deficiency can cause irreversible mental retardation
called cretinism. TSH levels are checked in all newborns
for this relatively common abnormality; the levels
will be raised if the thyroid gland is not functioning
correctly.

Diagnosis
Hypothyroidism is not investigated as thoroughly as
hyperthyroidism, since treatment does not vary. Free
T3 and T4 levels are low, whereas TSH levels are usually
raised. If TSH is low then a lesion of the hypothalamus
or pituitary is likely. Autoantibodies can be detected in
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

Treatment
All hypothyroidism is treated with thyroxine (T4) administered as an oral tablet in varying doses. The dose
is increased over several months, with regular monitoring of TSH levels until they are within the normal
boundaries. This process is slow, since it takes 4 weeks
for TSH levels to reflect an increased dose due to the
long half-life of thyroxine. Thyroxine therapy is usually
maintained for life.

Over-treatment of hyperthyroidism
Radioactive ablation and surgical removal of the thyroid
gland initially cure hyperthyroidism, but with time, the
remaining thyroid tissue is often insufficient. Hypothyroidism can develop and lifelong thyroxine treatment is
required.
Many drugs can also cause reversible hypothyroidism including lithium, amiodarone and excess iodine.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
When the thyroid gland is inflamed, the disease is called
thyroiditis. This can be caused by autoimmune or viral
processes. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a destructive autoimmune disease that is especially common in middleaged women. It is mediated by autoantibodies against
rough endoplasmic reticulum (microsomal antibodies)
or thyroglobulin. The presence of these antibodies can

3

be tested to confirm the diagnosis. The thyroid gland
is infiltrated by lymphocytes that cause the gland to enlarge, forming a goitre.
The initial destruction of the thyroid gland can release the thyroglobulin colloid causing temporary hyperthyroidism. The patients usually progress to a
euthyroid (normal) state and finally develop progressive hypothyroidism.

De Quervain’s (subacute) thyroiditis
De Quervain’s thyroiditis is inflammation of the thyroid
gland caused by a virus. It is common in young or middle-aged women, in whom it causes a tender swollen
gland along with a febrile illness. The inflammation
causes an initial increase in thyroid hormone release followed by destroying the follicles, which causes hypothyroidism and leakage of the thyroglobulin colloid. An
immune reaction against this colloid causes the formation of granulomas, so this disease is also called granulomatous thyroiditis.

Primary atrophic hypothyroidism
Spontaneous or primary atrophic hypothyroidism is a
disease resulting in hypothyroidism in the elderly.
The biochemical profile may include the presence of
TSH-R-blocking autoantibodies, but in this condition
the thyroid fibroses and shrinks so that there is no goitre. It is suspected that this disease is the end-stage of
many thyroid diseases, including Hashimoto’s and de
Quervain’s thyroiditis.

Dyshormonogenesis
This is an inherited defect in the synthesis of thyroid
hormones, and can present with hypothyroidism and
goitre.

Iodine deficiency
Iodine deficiency was once a common cause of goitre in
regions where the soil lacked iodine (e.g. Derbyshire,
England), but nowadays iodine is added to salt to prevent this. Deficient iodine means that thyroid hormones cannot be synthesized, with a resultant rise in
TSH levels. TSH causes thyroid enlargement by stimulating follicle growth and the development of new blood
vessels, so the thyroid gland enlarges.

Goitres
A goitre is a swelling in the neck caused by an enlarged
thyroid gland. It is a common finding, and it is usually
asymptomatic; however, large goitres can compress the
oesophagus and trachea. If a goitre is associated with hyperthyroidism it is described as ‘toxic’. Non-toxic goitres

33

The thyroid gland
secrete normal or reduced levels of thyroid hormones.
Non-toxic goitres are usually the result of excessive
TSH stimulation in the presence of hypothyroidism.
Goitres are treated by correcting the underlying pathology or by surgical removal for cosmetic reasons or to
prevent compression of surrounding structures.

Iodine deficiency
The goitre formed by this process is diffusely enlarged
and smooth. It is sometimes called an endemic goitre
because it occurred in certain regions.

Graves’ disease
The constant stimulation of TSH receptors in Graves’
disease causes a goitre in a similar manner to iodine deficiency with similar characteristics. The gland becomes
very vascular, to the extent that a bruit can be heard
using a stethoscope.

The goitre formed is usually slightly nodular, but it may
be tender if the inflammation is acute.

Thyroid gland neoplasia
Thyroid lumps are common and usually benign; however, they must be investigated. Solitary thyroid lumps
are found in 5% of women and it is very difficult to distinguish between benign (80%) and malignant (20%)
on clinical grounds. A fine-needle aspiration should
be performed along with thyroid function tests. Aspiration alone will not distinguish a follicular adenoma
from a follicular carcinoma but low TSH suggests the
former as malignant nodules are not usually
hyperfunctioning.
Causes of solitary thyroid lumps include:

Puberty and pregnancy

•
•
•
•

Higher levels of thyroid hormones are required in puberty and pregnancy so the thyroid gland often enlarges
to meet the increased demand. This enlargement is a
physiological response, not a pathological process.
The goitre regresses once the demand lessens.

Five separate forms of cancer can arise in the thyroid
gland, but three of these are derived from the follicle
cells. These tumours are summarized in Fig. 3.11.
Medullary carcinomas of the parafollicular cells often secrete ectopic hormones, including:

Multinodular goitre

• Calcitonin – usually asymptomatic
• Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) – Cushing’s
syndrome
• 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) – carcinoid
syndrome.

Many elderly people have an enlarged thyroid that contains many nodules of varying sizes. These nodules are
formed from hyperplasia (increased number) of thyroid
cells. The excess cells sometimes cause excess thyroid
hormone production, i.e. hyperthyroidism. The disease
is then called toxic multinodular goitre.

Thyroiditis
Inflammation of the thyroid gland can cause swelling, and
infiltration by lymphocytes can also cause enlargement.

Nodule of multinodular goitre
Follicular adenoma
Malignancy.

The molecular biology of thyroid
cancer
A great deal has been learnt about the molecular
biology of thyroid cancer. Fifty per cent of papillary
thyroid cancers have a translocation that causes

constitutive activation of the RET proto-oncogene. RET
is a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, which when active can drive oncogenesis (the development of neoplasia). In follicular thyroid cancer
(FTC), 40% of cases have an activating point mutation
of the RAS proto-oncogene; 60% of FTCs were shown
to produce an abnormal ‘fusion protein’ (PAX-8/
PPARg), which is the result of two gene fragments coming together by translocation and producing a single
gene product. Medullary thyroid cancer often occurs
as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome
and as such is often associated with RET mutations.
The more aggressive form, anaplastic thyroid cancer,
is often associated with a p53 mutation. This new
knowledge of the events driving thyroid neoplastic
transformation has opened up novel avenues for
therapy.

Medical emergencies of the
thyroid
Occasionally, thyroid disorders present as an
emergency.
A thyrotoxic crisis/ thyroid storm is an acute severe attack of hyperthyroidism, usually precipitated by thyroid
surgery, infection, trauma and radioiodine therapy. Signs
and symptoms include pyrexia, confusion, diarrhoea,
vomiting, coma and life-threatening arrhythmias. The diagnosis can be confirmed using a technetium scan, but
this should come second to urgent treatment. Treatment
is with beta-blockers and antithyroid therapy, with additional treatments to treat the underlying cause, e.g. antibiotics for infection.
Myxoedema coma is another emergency, associated
with hypothyroidism, precipitated by infection, stroke,
myocardial infarction and trauma. A history of treatment for hyperthyroidism, e.g. surgery or radioiodine
therapy, is common. Signs and symptoms include hypothermia, hyporeflexia, hypoglycaemia, bradycardia,
coma and seizures.

Examination of the thyroid
Signs of thyroid disease are elucidated by examining the
energetic state of the patient. The main components of
any examination are inspection, palpation, percussion
and auscultation.

Inspection
The patient will look different depending on the problem with the thyroid. The general signs and symptoms
for hyperthyroidism are shown in Fig. 3.9 and hypothyroidism in Fig. 3.10.
Closer inspection may reveal further pathology
(Figs 3.12 and 3.13).

Examination of the neck, eyes and legs is very important for the thyroid. Anterior and lateral inspection of
the neck can reveal thyroid masses. Patients are asked
to swallow some water and thyroid masses will move
with the trachea. Palpation of the thyroid isthmus
and lobes looks for any displacement, enlargement
and/or nodules. The thyroid can also be palpated
during swallowing. A full examination would include
palpation of regional lymph nodes.

35

The thyroid gland
Percussion is only used to detect any enlargement
of the thyroid inferiorly to behind the sternum.
Percussion of the sternum is dull in the presence of a
retrosternal mass.
Auscultation is of the arteries in the neck to detect
any bruits (turbulent blood flow) due to increased
vascularity.

Thyrotrophin-releasing hormone
stimulation test

Investigations and imaging of the
thyroid

Thyroid autoantibody assay

Investigation of thyroid function overlaps with pituitary
testing as thyroid disorders can be secondary to pituitary
problems. One method for investigating the thyroid is
hormone assays.

Hormone assays
If abnormalities of thyroid function are suspected then
plasma levels of TSH, T4 and T3 should be measured.
Both thyroid hormones should be measured because
variations in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels
can give inaccurate results. Further investigations are
often not needed:
• Low levels of T4 and T3 – hypothyroidism
• High levels of T4 and T3 – hyperthyroidism.
TSH is measured with T4 and T3 to locate the lesion.
In hypothyroidism a low TSH suggests a pituitary/
hypothalamus lesion while a high TSH suggests a
thyroid gland problem. In hyperthyroidism, TSH will
almost always be low as pituitary and hypothalamic
lesions causing high TSH are rare.
TSH is also measured to guide thyroxine treatment of
thyroid disorders. The correct dose of thyroxine or carbimazole is being administered when TSH levels return
to normal.

36

This stimulation test is used if TSH deficiency due
to pituitary lesion is suspected. Hypothalamic TRH is
administered intravenously and plasma TSH levels
are measured before and after to assess pituitary response.

ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) can also
be used to detect thyroid autoantibodies caused by
the common autoimmune thyroid diseases:
• Thyroid receptor antibodies (TRAb) suggest Graves’
disease
• Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and antithyroglobulin (anti-TgAb) antibodies suggest Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
Management of thyroid nodules varies between
hospitals. Findings of irregular firm nodules, lymph node
involvement or tethering to surrounding structures on
clinical examination are suggestive of malignancy.
Ultrasound and thyroid biochemistry are usually used as
the first-line investigations, Malignancy is more
commonly associated with euthyroidism or
hypothyroidism and hypo-echoic lesions on ultrasound.
Isotope scans can reveal ‘hot’ (functioning – and less likely
to be malignant) and ‘cold’ (non-functioning) nodules.
If thyroid biochemistry is within the normal range and
nodules are ‘cold’, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAC)
can be performed as the most sensitive and specific test for
confirming a diagnosis of malignancy.

The adrenal glands

the end of this chapter you should be able to:
Explain the structure and development of the adrenal glands
Describe the synthesis of adrenal hormones
Understand the regulation and physiological effects of adrenal hormones
Discuss the major disorders associated with adrenal function.

The two adrenal glands are incredibly important because the hormones they secrete enable the body to respond to the stresses of life, both emotional and
physical.
The adrenal glands are located on the superior pole
of each kidney. During embryonic development the adrenal gland forms two functionally distinct regions,
each with a different embryological origin. The outer,
larger region is called the adrenal cortex and the inner,
much smaller, adrenal medulla.
The adrenal cortex is controlled by the pituitary
gland, responding to a hormone called adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). The cells of the cortex secrete
three steroid hormones and each has a distinctly different function from the others.
• Glucocorticoids – produced in response to stress
• Mineralocorticoids – regulate blood volume
• Androgens – control sexual development.
The adrenal medulla is composed of sympathetic
nerve cells, though the cells here have no axons. It has
the same embryonic origin as sympathetic nerves and
is considered a modified sympathetic ganglion of the
autonomic nervous system (ANS). The cells of the medulla are under the direct control of the sympathetic
nervous system, which causes it to secrete two amino
acid hormones. These act to enhance the effects the sympathetic division of the ANS has on the rest of the body
during stress.
• Adrenaline (epinephrine)
• Noradrenaline (norepinephrine).
The most important hormones produced by the adrenal glands are glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. This
hormone has the very important function in normal life
as it can protect humans from stress-induced hypotension, shock and death. Synthetic glucocorticoids are
known as ‘steroids’ or ‘corticosteroids’ and are commonly used in the treatment of acute inflammatory
diseases. The mechanism that controls the release of

these hormones is a negative-feedback system known
as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis
(Fig 4.1).
An excess of glucocorticoid causes Cushing’s syndrome and a deficiency causes Addison’s disease.
Another important hormone to note is adrenaline,
which is used as an emergency treatment in situations
such as anaphylactic shock or cardiac arrest.

ANATOMY
There are two adrenal glands (also called suprarenal
glands in America), associated with the superior aspect
of each kidney. However, each adrenal gland has a different shape and relation to the other. As previously
mentioned the glands have an inner and outer region,
each with its own individual controls and secretions,
so they can be thought of as a gland within a gland.
The glands are retroperitoneal, covered in perinephric
fat and enclosed in renal fascia; however, there is a thin
septum which separates each gland from its associated
kidney.

Right adrenal gland
The right gland is shaped like a pyramid and is located
posterior to the right lobe of the liver. The inferior vena
cava and the right crus of the diaphragm lie medial and
lateral, respectively, to the adrenal gland.

Left adrenal gland
The left gland is the larger of the pair and is crescentshaped. Anterior to the gland is part of the pancreas,
stomach and occasionally the spleen. The left crus of
the diaphragm lies laterally. The diaphragm also lies
posterior to both adrenal glands (Fig 4.2).

hormone.)

Blood supply, nerves and
lymphatics
The blood supply to the adrenal glands is massive and
comes from three main sources:
• Superior suprarenal arteries – multiple branches
from the inferior phrenic arteries as they pass upward from the abdominal aorta
• Middle suprarenal artery – branches off directly
from the abdominal aorta
• Inferior suprarenal arteries – inferior branches
from the renal arteries ascend to supply the glands.

38

By comparison, the venous drainage is much simpler
than the arterial supply. The right adrenal vein is short
and immediately enters the inferior vena cava, whereas
the left adrenal gland travels inferior to enter the left renal vein.
The outer cortex receives no significant innervations;
instead it is regulated by ACTH from the pituitary gland
and other bloodborne factors.
The medulla is innervated directly by the splanchnic
nerves, which arise from the thoracic spinal cord and do
not synapse before reaching the adrenal medulla. The
nerves are therefore preganglionic sympathetic nerves
that release acetylcholine, while all other tissues receive
postganglionic sympathetic innervations. The cause of
this relationship is apparent from their development
(see below).
Lymphatic drainage of the adrenal glands is through
the para-aortic nodes.

The adrenal cortex develops from mesodermal cells that
lie adjacent to the urogenital ridge. The fetal zone of the
cortex develops first. Later, more mesodermal cells surround the fetal cortex to form the permanent cortex
found in adults. At birth, the permanent cortex has
two layers, while a third (the zona reticularis) develops
by the third year of life. At around this time the fetal
cortex regresses until only the developed medulla and
permanent cortex are left.
The zona reticularis matures around the age of
8 years old and begins to secrete weak androgens. This
is called adrenarche and is discussed later.

Adrenal medulla
The adrenal medulla is derived from ectodermal neural crest cells of the embryo. They form part of the
amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD)
system. These cells contribute to many diverse structures, including all the noradrenaline-secreting postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous
system. The secretory cells in the adrenal medulla secrete either adrenaline or noradrenaline, and they
are essentially highly specialized neurons (Fig. 4.3).
The medullary precursor cells also form paraganglia
in the organ of Zuckerkandl located around the origin
of the inferior mesenteric artery and the aortic bifurcation, which act as accessory medullary tissue and are a
common site of extra-adrenal catecholamine-secreting
tumours.

MICROSTRUCTURE

The blood in these sinusoids passes directly into the
adrenal medulla.

Adrenal cortex

Adrenal medulla

The adult adrenal cortex makes up about 90% of the
adrenal gland by weight. It is functionally and anatomically divided into three layers, which secrete
the following groups of steroid hormone (Figs 4.4
and 4.5):

The adrenal medulla comprises two types of neuroendocrine cell:

• Outer zona glomerulosa secretes mineralocorticoids
• Middle zona fasciculata secretes glucocorticoids
• Inner zona reticularis secretes androgens and
glucocorticoids.
These hormone groups will be explained later in this
chapter.
The cells of the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis
are arranged in columns around blood sinusoids.

• Noradrenaline-secreting cells (20%)
• Adrenaline-secreting cells (80%).
Both types contain neuroendocrine granules that store
the hormone. In older textbooks, these cells are called
chromaffin cells because they turn a dark-brown colour
if exposed to oxygen after fixation in chrome salts.
The cells are arranged around blood sinusoids.
Medullary cells require the steroid cortisol to convert
noradrenaline to adrenaline. Cortisol is produced in the
cortex, and it travels in the cortical capillaries to the medulla. Separate medullary arteries supply oxygenated
blood directly.

The adrenal cortex secretes three groups of steroid
hormones:
• Mineralocorticoids, e.g. aldosterone, deoxycortisone
• Glucocorticoids, e.g. cortisol
• Androgens, e.g. dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).

Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol.
Steroid hormones are small lipid-soluble molecules that
cross membranes readily. Inside cells, they act on intracellular receptors to regulate gene expression. The synthesis and mechanism of action of steroid hormones

MINERALOCORTICOIDS AND
ALDOSTERONE

Regulation of aldosterone
Mineralocorticoids help to regulate the electronic balance of plasma; their name is derived from this action
on the body’s minerals. Aldosterone is the main mineralcorticoid secreted by the zona glomerulosa. Aldosterone release is stimulated by:
• Angiotensin II
• High plasma potassium
• ACTH.
Angiotensin II is released in response to low blood volume as part of the renin–angiotensin system (see
Chapter 7 and Fig. 4.6). ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland is less important as a regulator, so pituitary
failure does not severely impair aldosterone secretion.
An excess of aldosterone due to an adrenal adenoma
is called Conn’s disease.

Actions of aldosterone
Aldosterone acts mainly on the distal convoluted tubule
(DCT) and the collecting duct of the kidney. It causes
reabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium
and hydrogen ions. Water is also reabsorbed and blood
volume is increased. Other hormones are involved in
this mechanism and they are discussed in more detail
in Chapter 7 on fluid balance.

Intracellular actions of
aldosterone
To cause these physiological effects, aldosterone acts on
the nucleus via an intracellular receptor. Only cells that
express this receptor can respond to aldosterone.

Aldosterone up-regulates the expression of four genes
in the cells of the DCT and collecting duct. The actions
of the gene products (proteins) are described in Fig. 4.7.
Aldosterone circulates in the plasma with 60%
bound to albumin and 40% free, and therefore active.
The high proportion of free hormone causes aldosterone to be rapidly degraded by the liver, giving a short
half-life of about 15 minutes.

GLUCOCORTICOIDS AND
CORTISOL
Glucocorticoids regulate the metabolism of carbohydrate, protein and, to a lesser extent, fat. Glucocorticoids
also have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The major glucocorticoid in humans is

cortisol. Cortisol also plays an important part in metabolic adaptation in response to stressful stimuli.
During fasting, glucocorticoids act to maintain
plasma glucose levels.

Regulation of cortisol
Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted by
the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior pituitary
to produce pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which is
converted to ACTH and leads to increased ACTH release. ACTH, in turn, acts on G-protein-coupled receptors on the wall of the adrenal cells to stimulate
steroidogenesis. Vasopressin can increase the ability of

42

CRH to cause ACTH release. Cortisol has a negative
feedback effect on the hypothalamus (inhibits CRH
transcription) and anterior pituitary gland (inhibits
POMC transcription) to inhibit CRH and ACTH release.
Cortisol release displays a circadian rhythm, i.e. the
rate of secretion changes through a 24-hour period
(Fig. 4.8). The highest levels of cortisol release are in
the early morning, peaking at about 6 a.m., then falling
throughout the day. This circadian variation is initiated
in the hypothalamus by changing sensitivity to cortisol
levels. Cortisol exerts a weaker negative feedback effect
in the morning, so CRH release rises. The circadian
rhythm must be taken into account when making
plasma cortisol measurements.

Androgens

There is some overlap between the actions of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Cortisol can have mineralocorticoid actions and aldosterone can act as a
glucocorticoid.

Like all steroid hormones, cortisol acts via intracellular
receptors to regulate gene expression. The receptor and
genes vary between cells, and this accounts for the wide
range of actions. The anti-inflammatory actions are produced by inhibiting phospholipase A2, an enzyme that
is essential for the production of prostaglandins from
arachidonic acid.
Most cortisol (95%) is transported round the body
bound to plasma proteins:

Fig. 4.8 Circadian variation in plasma cortisol in resting and
chronically stressed subjects.

• 80% bound to cortisol-binding protein
• 15% bound to albumin
• 5% free and active.

Actions of cortisol

Cortisol is inactivated in the liver by conjugation and
then excreted from the kidney. About 1% of cortisol is
excreted into the urine without metabolism. This can
be detected by 24-hour urine collection to estimate
blood cortisol levels.

Physical and psychological stressors (e.g. trauma, haemorrhage, fever) increase ACTH and cortisol secretion, which,
in turn, regulate metabolic adaptations to these stimuli.
This effect is very important, and cortisol deficiency can
rapidly become life-threatening under stressful conditions. The response to stress is called the general adaptation syndrome (GAS), and it is divided into three phases:

Alarm reaction

The immunosuppressive properties of synthetic
corticosteroids (‘steroids’, e.g. prednisolone) are
commonly employed in the treatment of autoimmune
conditions and inflammatory disorders.

A stressful stimulus causes:
• Noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves
• Adrenaline and noradrenaline release from adrenal
medulla
• Cortisol release from adrenal cortex.

Resistance
The effects of cortisol are slower to initiate, as they are
dependent on transcription. However they are longerlasting than those of adrenaline and noradrenaline; this
allows the resistance to stress to be maintained. It also
counteracts the effects of other hormones (e.g. insulin)
to maintain substrates required to combat stress.

ANDROGENS
Androgens are sex steroids, i.e. hormones involved
in the growth and function of the male and female genital tract. They also stimulate muscle growth (anabolism), hence their use as an illicit drug in sport.
Androgens are made in the adrenal gland in both males
and females. However, in males they account for only a
small proportion of total androgen production.

Exhaustion

Actions of adrenal androgens

Prolonged stress causes continued cortisol secretion, and
it results in muscle wastage, immune system suppression
and hyperglycaemia. Cortisol affects almost every cell in
the body. The physiological effects are described in
Fig. 4.9. The main actions of cortisol are:

Adrenal androgens are synthesized in the zona reticularis
of the adrenal gland; the main adrenal androgens are:

• Increase of energy metabolite levels in the blood
• Suppression of the immune system and inhibition
of allergic and inflammatory processes.

• Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
• Androstenedione.
Androgens secreted by the adrenal glands have weak biological activity, but they are converted to more active
androgens, such as testosterone, by aromatase and other
enzymes in peripheral tissues.

Adrenarche
The initiation of androgen secretion from the adrenal
glands is called adrenarche. It occurs a few years before puberty (about 7–9 years of age), and it is marked by maturation of the zona reticularis and a rise in plasma DHEA.
In males, the early development of the male sex organs may result from adrenal androgens released after
adrenarche. In male adult life adrenal androgens account for only 5% of total activity, so they are physiologically negligible.
In the female, adrenal androgens are responsible for
about 50% of total androgen activity from adrenarche
to the end of life. These hormones help to promote
the growth of female pubic and axillary hair.

DISORDERS OF THE ADRENAL
CORTEX
The main diseases of the adrenal cortex are caused
by an excess or deficiency of mineralocorticoids
or glucocorticoids. There are four named diseases

44

affecting the adrenal cortex hormones; however, they
are rare diseases:
• Cushing’s syndrome – chronic, excessive cortisol
production
• Cushing’s disease – ACTH-secreting tumour
• Conn’s syndrome – aldosterone-secreting tumour
• Addison’s disease – deficiency of cortisol and
aldosterone.
Both Cushing’s and Conn’s are important endocrine
causes of hypertension.

Hyperaldosteronism
Excess aldosterone production causes sodium ion and
water retention with increased excretion of potassium
and hydrogen ions. The main symptoms and signs
(Fig. 4.10) are:
•
•
•
•
•

Hypertension (high blood pressure)
Hypokalaemia (low potassium)
Alkalosis (raised blood pH)
Polyuria and polydipsia (thirst)
Muscle weakness and spasm.

A number of blood tests are used for diagnosis:
• Urea and electrolytes (U þ Es) for hypokalaemia
• Aldosterone levels (raised)
• Renin levels (variable).
Aldosterone increases blood volume, which inhibits renin secretion. If renin levels are low then the disorder is
primary hyperaldosteronism, i.e. the disease originates
in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands can then be
imaged by CT/MRI scanning.
Renin stimulates aldosterone release via angiotensin
II, so high renin levels suggest secondary hyperaldosteronism. This disorder is external to the adrenal glands;
it is a common response to heart failure and renal
disease.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism
Secondary hyperaldosteronism is a very common problem caused by activation of the renin–angiotensin system. The most common cause is excessive diuretic
therapy, but it is also a feature of:
•
•
•
•

Congestive heart failure
Renal artery stenosis
Nephritic syndrome
Cirrhosis with ascites.

All these conditions result in decreased renal perfusion,
which stimulates renin release.

Excess cortisol
Cushing’s syndrome

Primary hyperaldosteronism and
Conn’s syndrome
Primary hyperaldosteronism is a rare disease that is responsible for about 1% of patients with hypertension.
The vast majority of primary hyperaldosteronism is
caused by Conn’s syndrome, in which the patients have
an adenoma of the zona glomerulosa. This is discussed
later in this chapter.

The triad of hypertension, hypokalaemia and alkalosis
should raise the suspicion of Conn’s syndrome.
Conn’s syndrome is the result of an adrenocortical
adenoma causing primary hyperaldosteronism.
Hyperaldosteronism can also be seen as part of
congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to the presence
of excess ACTH. Patients with Conn’s syndrome
have a high plasma aldosterone. They also have low
plasma renin due to the effects of chronic water/
salt retention. Renal artery stenosis can also cause this
pattern of symptoms, but these patients have a high
plasma renin.

Cushing’s syndrome is a rare condition caused by a
chronic excess of glucocorticoids. The disorder can be
in the anterior pituitary gland or the adrenal cortex,
or it may result from excess medication. It has a 5-year
mortality of about 50% if it is not treated.
The symptoms and signs of Cushing’s syndrome are
shown in Figs 4.9 and 4.11; it is most common in adult
women.
Diagnosing excess cortisol is complicated by the circadian variation in cortisol secretion. The first-line
screening consists of two main tests which are employed
to overcome this problem:
• Overnight dexamethasone suppression test: plasma
cortisol is measured before an oral dexamethasone
(a synthetic glucocorticoid) dose and then at 8 a.m.
the next morning. In a normal person plasma cortisol
would be suppressed.
• Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol: 1% of free cortisol is excreted unmetabolized, and this can be measured to give an accurate reflection of plasma cortisol.
It is important to note that ‘pseudocushing’s’ (false positives) are seen in other diseases, e.g. depression, obesity, alcohol excess or anything that increases the rate
of dexamethasone metabolism.

Second-line investigations:
• Forty-eight-hour dexamethasone suppression test:
oral dexamethasone is given every 6 hours for
2 days with cortisol measured at 0 and 48 hours.
In Cushing’s syndrome, cortisol levels will remain
elevated.
• Midnight cortisol: this is less commonly used as it requires admission and is often inaccurate. Cortisol
levels are normally lowest at midnight, though it is
elevated in Cushing’s syndrome.
The next step is locating the source of the problem as
this will determine the course of treatment.

Treatment with glucocorticoids
This is the most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome.
Glucocorticoids (often simply called ‘steroids’) are used
to treat a wide range of medical conditions, usually to

46

reduce immune reactions. These conditions include
asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and post-transplantation. Patients are treated
with the lowest dose that will control their condition because prolonged use can cause the features of Cushing’s
syndrome. Inhaled steroids are used in asthma to reduce
the systemic dose, especially in children, in whom
growth retardation may occur.
A review of the patient’s medication will locate any
iatrogenic cause and, if possible, the medication needs
to be gradually stopped.

Cushing’s disease
Cushing’s disease refers to the specific condition of excess corticosteroids as a result of pituitary adenomas.
This stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete excess cortisol, leading to bilateral enlargement of the cortex. The

4

Disorders of the adrenal cortex
negative feedback that normally prevents excess ACTH
release is absent in the tumour.
This type of tumour causes Cushing’s syndrome
with the additional sign of pigmented skin. This is
due to the melanocyte-stimulating action of ACTH
on the receptors for the structurally similar melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) – formed by
the same gene (POMC) that makes ACTH. Cushing’s
disease occurs most frequently in young adult
women.
Cushing’s disease is treated by surgical removal of the
pituitary adenoma. This may result in panhypopituitarism (see Chapter 2 for more details).

Ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone
production
Ectopic ACTH can be secreted by the rare, but highly
malignant, small-cell anaplastic carcinoma of the lung
(also called oat-cell carcinoma). This carcinoma displays the characteristics of a neuroendocrine cell despite
developing from bronchial epithelium. Even more
rarely, tumours of the thymus, ovary, pancreas and carcinoid tumors can secrete ACTH or CRH. The excess
production is so dramatic that patients rarely exhibit
features of Cushing’s syndrome before death. Ectopic
hormones are discussed in Chapter 10.

Neoplasia of the adrenal cortex
Benign adenoma of the adrenal cortex is relatively common, but only a small proportion secrete hormones. If
cortisol is secreted, then Cushing’s syndrome develops; aldosterone-secreting adenomas cause Conn’s syndrome.
Adrenal adenomas are the most common cause of
Cushing’s syndrome in children, but they account
for only 10% of adult disease. In Conn’s syndrome, adenomas of the adrenal cortex are the most common
cause of primary hyperaldosteronism in all age groups.
Adenomas associated with either syndrome are removed surgically, but cortisol replacement is necessary
due to long-term ACTH inhibition.
Carcinoma of the adrenal cortex is a very rare condition. Such carcinomas secrete vast excesses of glucocorticoids and androgens. The patient usually dies before
the physical features of Cushing’s syndrome develop.
The main way to localize the cause of elevated cortisol is with a plasma ACTH measurement following a 48hour dexamethasone suppression test.
Undetectable ACTH levels indicate an adrenal tumour, which requires imaging and further investigations to locate and diagnose. If ACTH is detectable,
then it is important to distinguish a Cushing’s disease
from ectopic ACTH production. See ‘Investigations
and Imaging of the Adrenal Gland’.

Deficiency of cortisol and
aldosterone
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
ACTH controls the production of all the hormones in
the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis. Cortisol
is solely responsible for negative feedback on ACTH
production. Therefore, any deficiency in cortisol relieves
the suppression of ACTH release and glucocorticoid,
mineralocorticoid and androgen production are perturbed. The gland tends to get larger under the trophic
influence of ACTH, and the condition is referred to as
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
One cause of CAH is an autosomal recessive deficiency of 21-hydroxylase. This enzyme is required for
the synthesis of aldosterone and cortisol, and both hormones are deficient. Low cortisol triggers ACTH release,
resulting in hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. Low aldosterone results in salt loss and neonatal shock in some
babies. The enlarged adrenal cortex secretes excess androgens, causing adrenogenital syndrome. This presents
differently in each sex. It can cause ambiguous genitalia
in both males and females. In males, it causes early (precocious) pseudopuberty; signs of secondary sexual development can be found by 6 months of age, but the
child is not fertile. Early bone epiphyseal fusion causes
short adult height.
In females, androgen excess causes masculinization
(also called virilization). The symptoms are similar to
those found in polycystic ovarian syndrome. They include masculine body shape, balding of temporal skull,
increased muscle bulk, deepening of the voice and
enlargement of the clitoris. (For greater detail, see Crash
Course Obstetrics and Gynaecology.)

Precocious puberty, salt-losing crisis or ambiguous
genitalia all indicate a possible diagnosis of CAH.
Plasma levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which are
raised in CAH, are used as a screen. Treatment
focuses on determining the baby’s gender by
karotyping and replacing glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids.

Adrenal cortex insufficiency
Adrenal cortex insufficiency tends to affect the whole
adrenal cortex rather than specific layers. Accordingly, deficiencies of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and androgens occur together, although clinical effects are due
to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency. These effects are
shown in Fig. 4.12. Hydrocortisone (cortisol) and fludrocortisone (a mineralocorticoid) therapy must be initiated
before the underlying disease process is treated.

Suspected adrenal cortex insufficiency is investigated
using the ACTH stimulation test. A synthetic ACTH analogue is injected and plasma cortisol levels are measured every 30 minutes. If the cortisol levels do not
rise sufficiently, then the disease is of the adrenal cortex
(i.e. Addison’s disease).

An acute exacerbation of Addison’s disease is called
an adrenal crisis. It is a life-threatening emergency
caused by stressful events such as infection. Its presentation is the same as acute adrenocortical failure.

Addison’s disease

This is a life-threatening condition characterized by:

Primary insufficiency of the adrenal cortex is called
Addison’s disease; it is characterized by deficient
secretion of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.
It is a rare chronic condition caused by progressive destruction of the adrenal cortex. This destruction can result from autoimmune adrenalitis, infection (e.g.
tuberculosis, fungi) or tumour. Addison’s disease
presents with adrenal cortex insufficiency, but the
high levels of circulating ACTH can cause skin pigmentation too.

48

Acute adrenocortical failure
• Hypotensive shock
• Hypovolaemic shock
• Hypoglycaemia.
The inhibitory action of cortisol on ACTH release is
important clinically. Patients treated with long-term
‘steroids’ cannot simply stop because ACTH release, and
therefore cortisol production, would also stop. Instead,
the dose must be lowered over a number of months.

Hormones of the adrenal medulla
The adrenal cortex can be destroyed acutely by bilateral haemorrhagic necrosis following disseminated intravascular coagulation. Essentially, blood clots block the
venous drainage of the adrenal cortex, causing cell death.
These clots can form following severe septicaemia. Meningococcal septicemia is the most common cause and
this is called Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome.
A similar situation can occur if long-term high-dose
steroid treatment is stopped abruptly. The prolonged
treatment chronically suppresses ACTH release from
the anterior pituitary gland so that no cortisol is secreted
from the adrenal cortex for a number of weeks.

Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency
Disorders of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary
gland can also cause deficiency of adrenal cortex steroid
hormones. Any condition that causes a reduction in
CRH or ACTH release will prevent the synthesis of glucocorticoids especially. These conditions are described
in more detail in Chapter 2.

HORMONES OF THE ADRENAL
MEDULLA
The adrenal medulla secretes two hormones: noradrenaline and adrenaline, which are catecholamines
(Fig. 4.13). Eighty per cent of catecholamine released from
the adrenal glands is adrenaline. The remainder of catecholamines are released at sympathetic nerve synapses.
Once cortisol excess has been confirmed, further tests
using higher doses of dexamethasone and measuring
ACTH levels can locate the source. If a 24-hour
suppression test is positive and ACTH is undetectable,
this suggests an adrenaloma. If the 24-hour test is
positive and ACTH is high, this suggests either pituitary

tumour, which can be suppressed with a 48-hour
suppression test or ectopic ACTH, which cannot be
suppressed with a 48-hour suppression test. CT scans
are used once a source has been identified.

Regulation
Catecholamines are released in response to stress (e.g.
exercise, pain, shock, hypoglycaemia and imminent
exams). Stress stimulates an area of the hypothalamus
that activates both the adrenocortical and sympatheticoadrenal systems. It receives no direct regulation from
the pituitary gland. Catecholamines exert their effects
over a shorter time course than cortisol.

Actions
Catecholamines from the adrenal medulla perform similar functions to direct sympathetic neuronal connections, in that they prepare the body for fight or flight.
Their effects last longer than the neuronal signals, so
they help to minimize the harm caused by repeated
stress. Adrenaline and noradrenaline have similar effects to each other.
Their main actions are described in Fig. 4.14 (for
more detail on the sympathetic nervous system, see
Crash Course Nervous System).

Intracellular actions
Adrenal catecholamines bind to receptors in a similar
manner to neuronal signals. These extracellular receptors are linked to intracellular G-proteins that initiate
a signal cascade. The effect of the signal depends on
the receptor present and the cell type, which are classified into alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.

Synthesis
Noradrenaline is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, which is then converted to adrenaline in response
to cortisol from the adrenal cortex.
The medullary cells store catecholamines in cytoplasmic granules. They are released into blood sinusoids by
exocytosis in response to acetylcholine from preganglionic sympathetic neurons.

the urine. Urinary VMA levels are measured to detect
phaeochromocytomas, a rare tumour of the adrenal medulla that is discussed below.

DISORDERS OF THE ADRENAL
MEDULLA

Phaeochromocytomas
Phaeochromocytomas are very rare tumours of the catecholamine-producing cells in the adrenal medulla.
They are usually benign and present in only one gland
(unilateral). Adrenaline and noradrenaline are secreted
in large quantities, causing severe, sporadic (paroxysmal) hypertension that can produce headaches. With
time, the hypertension can become constant, leading
to heart failure.

50

The first-choice test for diagnosing this tumour is
plasma free metanephrines. Other tests include the
detection of high levels of catecholamine breakdown
products in the urine, e.g. VMA. It is treated by surgical
excision. The surgery has a high perioperative mortality
due to the unstable blood pressure.
Catecholamine-producing tumours can also develop
in sympathetic ganglia. These usually occur beside the
abdominal aorta, near the bifurcation.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia
syndromes
A very rare autosomal dominant mutation causes inheritable phaeochromocytoma. These tumours can also develop in both glands (bilaterally) as a component of
multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN type
II), described in Chapter 10.

Investigations and imaging of the adrenal glands

INVESTIGATIONS AND IMAGING
OF THE ADRENAL GLANDS

Investigations
Some investigations have already been discussed in this
chapter. They work by detecting the levels of ACTH and
cortisol. They include:
• Overnight dexamethasone suppression test – serum
cortisol is measured, 1–2 mg dexamethasone is
given at midnight and then a second cortisol measurement is taken at 8 a.m. Normal patients will
have a decrease in both ACTH and cortisol secretion
to a level of <50 nmol/L.
• 24-hour urinary free cortisol – urine is collected
over 24 hours, with a normal value is < 280 nmol/
24 h. This provides an accurate guide to plasma cortisol levels.
• 48-hour dexamethasone suppression test – 0.5 mg/
6 h PO dexamethasone is given for 2 days with cortisol
measured at 0 and 48 hours. In normal patients, cortisol will fall to < 50 nmol/L and ACTH levels will drop.
• Midnight cortisol – this is less commonly used as it
requires admission and is often inaccurate. Cortisol
levels are normally lowest at midnight, though they
are elevated in Cushing’s syndrome.
As mentioned, these tests will help to diagnose Cushing’s syndrome, but localization of the cause requires
further testing.
An undetectable ACTH level indicates an adrenal tumour and requires additional testing to confirm. The
main methods used are:
• Ultrasound scanning – the use of harmless highfrequency sound waves can determine the composi-

4

tion of masses. A solid mass would suggest a tumour
whereas a fluid-filled mass may be a cyst.
• Computed tomography (CT) – produces a crosssectional image using X-rays.
Scans of both adrenal glands are required; however,
if this is unsuccessful at detecting any abnormalities
then sampling from the adrenal vein to check for elevated cortisol levels may be carried out.
If ACTH levels were detectable during initial investigations then this can indicate a pituitary tumour or an
ectopic ACTH-secreting tumour. To determine the
difference, two tests can be used:
• High-dose dexamethasone suppression test – 2 mg/
6 h dexamethasone is given orally for 48 hours. Measurements of cortisol in both urine and plasma are
taken at 0 and 48 hours. If there is a partial or complete suppression of cortisol, this is indicative of
Cushing’s disease. In Cushing’s disease some feedback remains so it should decrease slightly at least.
An autonomous ectopic source will not be affected
by the dexamethasone.
• Corticotrophin-releasing hormone test – 100 micrograms of human corticotrophin-releasing hormone is
given intravenously. A cortisol level is measured at
2 hours. Elevated cortisol levels indicate the source
of the problem is in the pituitary as CRH has no effect
on an ectopic ACTH-secreting tumour.
If the tests show a pituitary source then further investigation is required to identify the exact location and
direct treatment, though it is usually surgery (see
Chapter 2).
If the tests indicate an ectopic ACTH-secreting
tumour, then CT  MRI of the neck, thorax and abdomen is necessary to locate any small ACTH-secreting
carcinoid tumours.

Objectives
After reading this chapter you should:
• Know the relevant anatomy and developmental physiology of the pancreas and its ducts
• Understand the role of pancreatic hormones in the regulation of blood glucose
• Be able to explain the aetiology, symptoms, complications and treatment of diabetes mellitus
• Briefly discuss neoplasia of the endocrine pancreas.

The pancreas is an organ with both exocrine and endocrine functions. As an exocrine organ it is responsible for
producing and secreting digestive enzymes; however,
this chapter will focus on the endocrine functions of
the gland. Specifically, the pancreatic control of blood
glucose levels will be studied as the pancreas responds
to different control mechanisms than other endocrine
organs. The pancreas secretes two very important hormones that directly affect blood glucose, insulin and
glucagon. However, their secretion is regulated by the
levels of glucose detected by the pancreas directly and
not secreted in response to hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland (Fig. 5.1).
The pancreas is a flattened retroperitoneal gland located posterior and inferior to the stomach and between
the stomach and duodenum. The endocrine cells of the
pancreas are arranged in small clusters around the larger
exocrine cell clusters, called acini. The endocrine clusters
are called islets of Langerhans and within them are four
types of cells, the most abundant being the b-cells which
secrete insulin. Insulin is responsible for lowering blood
glucose by various means including increasing cellular
uptake of glucose and converting glucose to glycogen.
So as food enters our gastrointestinal tract, glucose is
absorbed into the body and the bloodstream. Insulin
acts to prevent the glucose in the blood from rising
too high and thus keeps it within tightly controlled
ranges.
To prevent blood glucose from dropping too far, we
have a hormone to also raise the blood glucose, glucagon. This is normally inhibited by insulin; however,
falling blood glucose causes inhibition of insulin secretion and glucagon secretion. The glucagon acts in the reverse of many of insulin’s actions, e.g. causing glucose to
leave cells and enter the blood.
The most common endocrine disorder is diabetes
mellitus, which is a deficiency of insulin (type 1, formerly
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) or increased insulin

resistance (type 2, formerly non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). In both cases, blood glucose rises,
resulting in hyperglycaemia and dehydration caused
by excessive urination as water follows the movement
of glucose (glycosuria) out of the body through the
kidneys. Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to serious
organ damage and life-threatening complications.
Important words:
Anabolism: processes that build large molecules
Catabolism: processes that break down large
molecules
Glycosuria: glucose in the urine
Polyuria: large volume of urine

ANATOMY
The pancreas is a long, flat organ that lies posterior to the
stomach and extends between the duodenum and
the spleen. The pancreas consists of four main parts,
the head, uncinate process, body and tail (Fig. 5.2).
• The head lies in the C-shaped curve of the duodenum, anterior to the inferior vena cava.
• The uncinate process is a projection from the posterior surface of the head, forming the ‘hook’ of the
pancreas. The superior mesenteric vessels run anterior to the uncinate process, separating it from the
head.
• The body and tail run anteriorly over the aorta and
left kidney and posterior to the stomach. The tail terminates at the hilum of the spleen. A branch of the
aorta (the coeliac trunk) lies superior and gives rise
to the splenic artery that lies along the upper pancreatic border.

Pancreatic duct
The digestive secretions of the pancreas are carried to the
duodenum along the pancreatic duct. It begins at the tail
and travels along the length of the pancreas to the head
where it intersects the bile duct to become the ampulla
of Vater (hepatopancreatic ampulla). This drains into
the duodenum through the sphincter of Oddi, a collection of smooth muscle.

Blood, nerves and lymphatics
The body and tail of the pancreas are supplied by small
branches of the splenic artery (largest branch of the coeliac trunk). The head and uncinate process are supplied
by the inferior and superior, posterior and anterior pancreaticoduodenal artery, branches of the common hepatic artery. Blood drains from the pancreas through
the pancreatic veins. These flow into the splenic veins
and the portal vein, which leads to the liver. Lymph
drains through small nodes and vessels and into the preaortic lymph nodes.
The endocrine pancreas is controlled by hormones
mainly; however, some autonomic nerves do reach
the pancreas. These are derived from the coeliac and superior mesenteric plexuses.

MICROSTRUCTURE
The pancreas contains two major tissue types, exocrine
(enzyme-secreting) and endocrine (hormone-secreting).
The endocrine cells are arranged in spherical clusters
called islets of Langerhans within the exocrine tissue
(Fig. 5.3). Each islet has a rich network of fenestrated
capillaries; however, only 10% of endocrine cells are innervated by the autonomic nervous system.
The islets are made up of endocrine cells containing
dense secretory granules. These cells are APUD (amine
precursor uptake and decarboxylation) cells (see
Chapter 6). There are four types of endocrine cell:
• Glucagon-secreting a-cells (20%)
• Insulin-secreting b-cells (70%)

DEVELOPMENT
major papilla

The pancreas is an endodermal structure that develops
from two buds derived from the foregut:
• Dorsal bud – the larger bud that forms the majority
of the gland
• Ventral bud – the smaller bud from the right side
near the bile duct.
The ventral bud rotates behind the duodenum, along
with the bile duct, to lie posterior to the dorsal bud. This
smaller ventral bud forms the uncinate process as it
fuses with the larger dorsal bud. The ducts usually fuse
so that the end of the pancreatic duct is formed from the
smaller ventral bud. The duct of the dorsal bud may persist as the accessory pancreatic duct. This sequence is
shown in Fig. 5.4.
All the pancreatic cells are thought to arise from a single endodermal precursor. Notch, TGF-beta and sonic
hedgehog are key genes in determining whether endodermal calls become pancreatic precursors, whether these
cells differentiate into exocrine or endocrine cells and,
finally, which islet cell lineage is followed. Other

factors, including cell adhesion molecules (integrins
and NCAMs) and proteolytic enzymes (i.e. matrix
metalloproteinases), determine how the precursor cells
migrate through the developing pancreas.

HORMONES

Insulin
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake, storage
and use of glucose. The beta islet cells secrete insulin
when they detect high blood glucose levels. As glucose

55

The pancreas
levels fall a few hours after a meal, insulin secretion is
reduced. The stored glucose can then be released to
maintain blood levels. Insulin secretion never ceases
completely; there is always a basal level of insulin in
the blood.

Synthesis
Insulin is a polypeptide hormone consisting of two
short chains (A and B) linked by disulphide bonds.
A single gene controls the production of preproinsulin,
which is broken down to form proinsulin. Further cleavage occurs within the secretory vesicles, resulting in two
molecules: insulin and C-peptide. Since equimolar insulin and C-peptide are produced, C-peptide acts as a
useful marker for b-cell activity in diabetics who receive
insulin treatment.

Insulin receptors
The insulin receptor consists of an alpha subunit, which
is extracellular, and an intracytoplasmic beta subunit,
which has tyrosine kinase activity. It must act via cellsurface receptors because it is a polypeptide hormone
and cannot readily cross the cell membrane. Insulin receptors are present in most cells, and they can be sequestered into the cell to inactivate them.
When insulin binds to the tyrosine kinase receptors,
it causes phosphorylation of tyrosine side chains
within the receptor. The phosphorylated receptor
forms a complex with and phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). This activated molecule
then initiates a cascade of phosphorylation and aggregation of other proteins to bring about the intracellular
effects of insulin.

Actions of insulin

Control of insulin secretion
Insulin secretion is controlled directly by detecting
blood glucose levels. Glucose and other metabolites
(e.g. amino acids and triglycerides, etc.) diffuse into
the beta islet cells, leading to increased ATP production.
The raised intracellular ATP levels inhibit membranebound potassium channels, causing beta cell depolarization. This causes voltage-sensitive calcium channels
to open, raising intracellular calcium. This rise promotes secretion of insulin in a biphasic pattern: the immediate release of preformed insulin, lasting less than a
minute, and then a sustained release of newly formed
insulin (Fig. 5.5). Normal daily adult production of insulin is 45–50 units.
Although metabolite concentrations are the main
regulators of insulin release, a number of other stimulants can also affect this pathway (Fig. 5.6). These stimuli can have either an inhibitory or stimulating effect
on plasma insulin levels but never reduce them
completely.

Insulin has an anabolic effect; it promotes the synthesis
of larger molecules. The stimulation of insulin receptors
regulates a variety of enzymes concerned with metabolites. The specific enzymes vary between cells (Fig. 5.7),
but the overall effects are:
• Increased uptake of metabolites
• Conversion of metabolites to stored forms (this is an
anabolic effect)
• Decreased breakdown of stored metabolites
• Recruitment of glucose channels to the cell membranes (e.g. GLUT 4)
• Use of glucose for energy over other metabolites.

Breakdown of insulin
Circulatory insulin has a half-life of approximately
5 minutes; however, proinsulin (released with insulin)
has a longer half-life, approximately 20 minutes. Insulin
is broken down primarily in the kidney and liver as well
as the placenta but almost every tissue can break it down.

The pancreas

Glucagon
Glucagon is synthesized in the pancreatic a cells and is
secreted in response to low levels of metabolites, resulting in a release of stored metabolites. In many respects,
glucagon has the opposite effect to insulin and functions to ensure there is an adequate supply of energy between meals. The most important cause for glucagon
secretion is falling glucose; however, a number of other
factors stimulate its release (Fig. 5.6).

Synthesis and actions
Glucagon is a single-chain polypeptide hormone
formed from a larger precursor in a manner similar to
insulin. The precursor is pre-proglucagon, which is
cleaved in the storage vesicles to yield proglucagon
and, finally, glucagon and the glucagon-like peptides.
Glucagon is a catabolic hormone; it promotes
the breakdown of large molecules. Glucagon binds to
G-protein-coupled receptor on the cell membrane,
and cAMP acts as a second messenger to initiate a cascade effect. Its effects vary between tissues (Fig. 5.8)
but broadly its actions are:
• Inhibition of glucose and amino acid uptake
• Breakdown of stored metabolites into useable metabolites (catabolism)
• Use of fatty acids for energy over other metabolites
• Promotes hepatic output of ketone bodies.

ENDOCRINE CONTROL OF
GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS
All cells in the body are capable of using glucose as an
energy source by the process of glycolysis. Most cells can
also use fatty acids with two important exceptions:

• Neurons (particularly the CNS), although they can
adapt to use ketone bodies
• Blood cells.
If blood glucose levels drop too low (hypoglycaemia)
then the brain is starved of energy. If levels rise too high
(hyperglycaemia) then glucose can become toxic. Blood
glucose is tightly controlled within narrow limits to prevent either scenario. Fasting glucose levels are normally
3.5–5.5 mmol/L.
For glucose levels to be maintained (glucose
homeostasis), the body must be able to increase or
decrease these levels in response to changes. There
are a number of ways that the body can respond
(Fig. 5.9). The liver is especially important in raising
blood glucose.

Insulin and glucagon
Glucose homeostasis is maintained by the interplay between insulin and glucagon. These two hormones act as
antagonists of each other because they are secreted under opposing conditions (Fig. 5.10).
• Insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating uptake,
metabolism and anabolism. It also inhibits the actions of glucagon.
• Glucagon raises blood glucose by stimulating gluconeogenesis (synthesis of glucose from amino acids)
and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen to release glucose). It also inhibits the actions of insulin
but stimulates insulin secretion.
Insulin is the only hormone that lowers blood
glucose levels but a number of hormones,
including glucagon and adrenaline (epinephrine),
can raise them.

Other hormones
Three non-pancreatic hormones also significantly increase blood glucose:
• Adrenaline – released in response to stress; it inhibits
insulin.
• Cortisol – released in response to stress; it reduces
sensitivity to insulin, which explains the diabetes
seen in Cushing’s patients.

Hyperglycaemia is an excess of glucose in the blood; it is
defined as a fasting concentrations >7.8 mmol/L. This
can occur in:
• Diabetes mellitus – a common disease caused by insulin deficiency or insulin resistance (reduced
sensitivity)
• Glucagonoma – a very rare tumour of the a cells that
secrete glucagon.

Hypoglycaemia
Hypoglycaemia is a deficiency of blood glucose defined
as a concentration <2.5 mmol/L. It can result from a variety of reasons, including:
• Taking oral hypoglycaemics (e.g. sulphonylurea) or
too much insulin
• Alcohol (binge or heavy drinking). This is very important to remember when assessing someone who you
think is drunk, as hypoglycaemia can mimic drunkenness as well as be caused by it
• Certain medications, e.g. quinine, salicylates or
propanolol
• Inappropriate levels of exercise or food intake. Type
1 diabetics control their blood glucose by balancing
insulin dosage, food intake and energy expended
through exercise
• Rare cases include liver, kidney, pancreas or thyroid
disease. Another cause is advanced insulin-secreting
tumours elsewhere in the body.

DIABETES MELLITUS

Types of diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus (DM) may be primary or secondary;
however, only 1–2% of presenting cases are as a result
of secondary causes (Fig. 5.11). Secondary causes are
important to catch as they are often treatable.
DM is caused by insulin deficiency or insulin resistance (reduced sensitivity) and results in chronic hyperglycaemia and metabolic abnormalities. This is a very
important disorder to understand as it is on the rise,
currently affecting 5.4% of the population of England.
The main types of DM are:
• Type 1 – caused by insulin deficiency
• Type 2 – caused by insulin insufficiency and/or
resistance
• Gestational diabetes resulting from pregnancy.

Type 1 DM
Type 1 DM is caused by autoimmune destruction of the
b-islet cells resulting in insulin deficiency. Tests reveal
autoantibodies in the blood of these patients in the
early years of life, long before clinical presentation. Type
1 DM has a peak incidence during puberty but a variant
form of type 1 DM called latent autoimmune diabetes of
adults (LADA) can occur at any age.
Type 1 DM has a genetic association with changes in the
human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes. In a pair of identical twins, when one develops type 1 DM the other has a
30–50% chance of developing it also. This points to the
development of the condition being multifactorial.

Type 2 DM
Type 2 DM used to be viewed as a disease of the elderly
but it is gradually rising in younger patients, mainly
those who are obese. It results from a decreased
sensitivity to insulin, or insulin insufficiency (compared

to deficiency in type 1 DM) or a combination of the two.
In type 2 DM, the body develops a resistance to insulin
over time and as such the body tries to compensate by
increasing insulin secretion. This continues over a period of several years until eventually the b-islet cells fail
and insulin secretion completely stops. Patients with
type 2 DM may present before or after the point when
insulin secretion ceases and this will affect their
treatment.
Family history is very important, with approximately
50% concordance in identical twins.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young
(MODY)
This is a different form of diabetes to the others and refers to several hereditary forms of diabetes caused by
mutations in an autosomal dominant gene, which disrupts insulin production. MODY is caused by at least
nine different gene defects and labelled MODY 1,
MODY 2, etc. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms. Around 2% of all diabetes cases are caused
by MODY gene defects. MODY is sometimes compared
to type 2 diabetes, and shares some type 2 diabetes
symptoms. However, MODY is not linked to obesity,
and typical MODY patients are young and not necessarily overweight. The severity of the different types varies
considerably.

Presentation of a diabetic patient
As discussed, insulin has an important role in glucose
homeostasis and metabolic regulation. As such DM
can present in a variety of ways, though there are some
differences in how each type can present.

Type 1 DM
Typically patients with undiagnosed type 1 DM present
with rapid onset of complaints (approximately 2–6week history, sometimes days). However it is important

Fig. 5.11 Secondary causes of diabetes
Endocrine – Cushing’s syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, phaechromocytoma, acromegaly,

Liver – Cirrhosis
Pancreas – Chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, haemochromatosis, pancreatic
carcinoma, cystic fibrosis
Drug-induced – Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroid use

Genetic syndromes – Friedreich’s ataxia, dystrophia myotonica

Diabetes mellitus
to realize that both types of DM can present with the
following symptoms/signs:
• Polyuria – blood glucose exceeds the threshold for
renal reabsorption resulting in osmotic diuresis
• Dehydration/thirst – as a result of excess fluid and
electrolyte loss
• Weight loss – loss of fluid and accelerated fat and
muscle breakdown secondary to insulin deficiency.
Additionally a patient, particularly a young patient, can
present with the early signs of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Signs of starvation are also important to note as they appear mainly in type 1 DM; both signs are discussed later.

Type 2 DM
As mentioned, the main difference in presentation between a patient with type 1 and one with type 2 DM
is the history of the complaint. Type 1 DM typically presents as an acute problem, whereas type 2 usually has a
much more gradual onset, with chronic problems developing over several months or years. The presenting complaint is typically related to a complication brought on
by years of worsening hyperglycaemia. The signs/symptoms typically seen are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Lethargy/tiredness
Blurred vision
Tingling and numbness in the feet
Impotence
Boils
Pruritus vulvae.

Other key presenting symptoms to be aware of are discussed below.

Symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Hyperglycaemia causes dehydration because glucose
is an osmotically active substance, i.e. it draws water
towards it. In hyperglycaemia, glucose concentration
is high in the blood and low in the cells so the cells
become dehydrated. The excess glucose is also excreted by the kidney and again water follows this
movement. Excess water is lost from the body along
with the electrolytes. The symptoms are summarized
in Fig. 5.12.

Symptoms of hypoglycaemia
In hypoglycaemia the body has insufficient glucose to
carry out its normal functions. The brain relies heavily
on blood glucose as it has no glucose stores of its
own; therefore, even mild hypoglycaemia can cause
symptoms. The early signs/symptoms of mild hypoglycaemia include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Feeling hungry
Trembling or shakiness
Sweating
Anxiety or irritability
Going pale
Tachycardia or palpitations
Tingling in the extremities or lips.

The pancreas
Someone suffering from severe hypoglycaemia can resemble someone who is drunk, so this should be kept
in mind when assessing patients with these symptoms.
They can have difficulty concentrating, be confused and
behave in a disorderly or irrational manner.

Symptoms of starvation
A lack of insulin over a protracted period of time can
cause the body to enter into a state of starvation. The excess circulating glucose, caused by raised glucagon, cannot enter the cells due to the lack of insulin. This causes
muscle and adipose tissue to be broken down to release
metabolites. The symptoms are listed in Fig. 5.12.
Preparations of insulin vary in their duration of action
and regimens are adapted according to the patient’s
lifestyle and requirements. Typically, long-acting insulin
(Lente) is given in the morning and at night to provide
basal insulin requirements and short-acting insulin is
administered 15 minutes prior to a meal to cope with the
postprandial hyperglycaemia. If control is poor in the
morning on this regimen then night-time insulin (Lente)
is adjusted. Insulin Lispro is a very rapidly acting insulin
preparation that can be used before a meal.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
This can be a dangerous and life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes. If a patient with type 2 diabetes
develops DKA, their diagnosis may need to be changed
from type 2 diabetes to type 1 diabetes except in certain
circumstances described below. It can present with subtle
symptoms but can rapidly progress if not treated correctly.

Mechanism of DKA
In the absence of insulin, the body is unable to use glucose for energy and fatty acids are released from adipose
tissue. These are converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetate and b-hydroxybutyrate) by the liver. The ketone
bodies are acidic and result in a metabolic acidosis.
The excess glucose (and the ketones) causes osmotic
diuresis as water and solutes are pulled into the urine,
which makes the patient dehydrated.
In type 1 diabetes there is a complete absence of insulin
but in type 2, insulin secretion may still be occurring,
which can suppress ketogenesis. However, extreme insulin
resistance can lead to the formation of ketones as there is
evidence to suggest that high levels of glucose actually
suppress insulin secretion, a phenomenon called glucotoxicity. The mechanism for this is yet to be fully determined. This means that patients with type 2 DM may
present in a state known as Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic
State, or HHS (previously known as HyperOsmolar

62

Non-Ketotic or HONK). Like DKA it is a life-threatening
condition and can present with similar symptoms.

Symptoms of DKA
Patients usually present with a history of the classic
symptoms of diabetes along with a few additional
signs/symptoms:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Polyuria
Excessive thirst
Lethargy
Anorexia
Hyperventilation
Ketotic breath (sweet smelling of pear drops)
Dehydration
Vomiting
Abdominal pain
Coma.

Complications of diabetes
Both types of diabetes can produce complications despite treatment; however, good glucose control lowers
the risk of developing severe complications. Chronic
complications are grouped according to the size of
blood vessel they affect:
• Macrovascular – large vessel disease due to accelerated atherosclerosis
• Microvascular – small vessel disease due to hyaline
arterioloscelerosis.

Macrovascular complications
Diabetes is a major risk factor for the development of
atherosclerosis. This results from raised fatty-acid levels
(hyperlipidaemia) caused by low insulin levels. Atheroma develops more rapidly and more severely than in
non-diabetics, and it can block arteries, causing ischaemia and a high risk of infarction. The major sites of
macrovascular disease (Fig. 5.13) are:
• The brain – the risk of stroke is twice as likely
• The heart – the risk of myocardial infarction is 3–5
times greater
• The kidneys – renal artery stenosis and hypertension
• The legs – gangrene, leading to amputation is 50
times more likely.

Microvascular complications
While atherosclerosis develops in major arteries, the
smaller arterioles and capillaries are at risk of hyaline
arteriolosclerosis. This is characterized by thickening
of the vessel wall and basement membrane. The vessel
lumen is reduced, causing localized ischaemia. Furthermore, the vessel loses integrity, allowing blood and
exudates to leak out. There are four main patterns of

microvascular disease (Fig. 5.13). Diabetic retinopathy
remains one of the most common causes of blindness
in people aged 30–65 years old.

Diagnosis
Normal blood glucose levels are normally 3.5–5.5 mmol/
L after an overnight fast. The most up-to-date NICE
guidelines for diabetes are given below.
One of the tests carried out in the diagnosis is a 2-hour
fasting glucose level measurement. The patient’s plasma
glucose is measured, then the patient ingests a 75-g glucose preparation and 2 hours later, plasma glucose is
measured again. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes are:
• A fasting plasma glucose level of 7.0 mmol/L
(126 mg/dL) OR
• A 2-hour plasma glucose level of  11.1 mmol/L
(200 mg/dL).
The report also provides diagnostic criteria for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG), which if diagnosed can provide a warning to
possible future development of diabetes. The criteria for
IGT are:

legs (nerves)
- peripheral
neuropathy
- ulceration

• A 2-hour plasma glucose level of 7.8 mmol/L and
< 11.1 mmol/L (140 mg/dL and 200 mg/dL).
The criteria for IFG are:
• A fasting plasma glucose level between 6.1 and
6.9 mmol/L (110 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL).
Another important and easy test is a urine dipstick
for glucose. Glycosuria (glucose in the urine) can indicate diabetes and requires further investigations. Currently there are no guidelines on the use of the blood
test HbA1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes. However,
HbA1c is now being considered as a diagnostic tool
globally.
Additional test for autoantibodies and measuring for
C-peptide deficiency can help determine decline in
b-islet cell function, which is useful in discriminating
type 1 from type 2 diabetes. However, there are no
guidelines on its use as a diagnostic tool for diabetes.

MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES
The key to successful management of diabetes relies
largely on educating both the patient and, where
appropriate, the patient’s family on the treatment involved. It is essential to make sure they understand that
the condition requires lifelong control. The management
varies between individuals to a degree and between the
different forms of diabetes. There is, however, some
overlap.

Diet
Dietary advice should be given to help regulate blood
glucose and minimize the risk of developing complications. Dietary intake should be distributed as
follows:
• Carbohydrates – more than 50%
• Protein – 10–15%
• Fat – 30–35%.
Additional advice to give patients includes:
• Avoid rapidly absorbing carbohydrates (e.g. glucose)
to prevent hyperglycaemia.
• Eat regular, small meals to prevent hypoglycaemia.
• Control calorie intake to lose/stabilize weight (especially type 2).
• Eat a low-fat, healthy diet to reduce atherosclerosis.
• Avoid smoking, recreational drugs and alcohol (eating carbohydrates before and after drinking reduces
risk of hypoglycaemic attack).
• Regular exercise can improve insulin sensitivity
but adjustments to insulin dosage and food intake
are vital.

Monitoring glucose control
Diabetics monitor their blood glucose levels regularly
to help with both short- and long-term control. The
following tests are available:
• Urine testing – not recommended for glucose monitoring as it is ineffective and associated with a low
patient satisfaction. Useful for monitoring for
ketonuria.
• Capillary blood spot testing – most commonly used
monitoring device for diabetics. Modern devices
are very simple to use and it gives an instant blood
glucose level.
• Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) – glucose binds
directly and irreversibly to haemoglobin to form
HbA1c. The proportion of HbA1c in the blood gives
a measure of glucose control over the previous
3 months (i.e. the approximate lifespan of a red
blood cell). It is commonly performed on diabetics
to help long-term management plans.

64

Management of type 1 DM
The main method of management is with subcutaneous
insulin injections, regular glucose monitoring and
a good diet.

Subcutaneous insulin injections
Insulin must be injected because it is inactivated if taken
orally. Typically the injection is given in the thigh or lower
abdomen. It is important to rotate through the sites
with each injection as only using one site will lead to lipohypertrophy (build up of fatty tissue at the site of injection)
or, less commonly, lipoatrophy (loss of adipose tissue
at the site). This can be unsightly and can lead to erratic
insulin absorption and poor blood glucose control.
The insulin forms currently being marketed are harvested from genetically altered bacteria, which produce
recombinant human insulin. This method greatly
reduces any adverse immune responses and complications in patients.
There are a variety of insulin regimens, each tailored
to suit the individual, to allow the best blood glucose
management. However, there are three basic regimens:
• One injection a day usually a long- or intermediateacting insulin
• Two insulin injections per day – with a mix of rapid- or
short-acting insulin with intermediate-acting insulin
• Multiple daily injection regimen – injections of
rapid- or short-acting insulin are taken before meals,
together with one or more separate daily injections
of intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin
• Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin
pump therapy) – a programmable pump and insulin
storage reservoir that gives regular or continuous insulin infusions.
Current guidelines recommend different management
plans depending on age.
• Preschool and primary school children should be
place on individualized treatment regimens to maximize glycaemic control.
• Young people should be offered multiple daily injection regimens to maximize glycaemic control. This
should be offered only as part of a package of care
that includes continuing education, dietary management, instruction on the use of insulin and blood
glucose monitoring, etc.
• Adults with type 1 diabetes should have access to the
types of insulin that they find allows them optimal
well-being.

Management of type 2 DM
Type 2 diabetes can be managed with lifestyle changes
alone for some time depending on the severity of the
disease at the time of presentation. However, as type

Examination of the diabetic patient
2 DM is a chronic, progressive disorder, pharmacological treatment will become part of a patient’s management at some point. Recent studies advocate intensive
therapy to aggressively manage blood glucose in type
2 diabetes.

Oral hypoglycaemic agents

• GLP-1/Incretin mimetic – administered via injection.
It acts to promote insulin secretion, reduces glucagon activity and slows glucose absorption in the
gut. Given as a third-level therapy in people with
a BMI  35.0 kg/m2 or where insulin administration would have occupational implications. Side
effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and
stomach pain.

These are the front-line treatment in those patients who
still have functioning insulin secretion. A number of
medications are available:
• Biguanides – increase peripheral glucose uptake and
reduce glucose output from the liver. Their mechanism of action is not fully understood. Side effects
include nausea, diarrhoea and lactic acidosis. They
are the first line of most treatments; the only available biguanide is metformin.
• Sulphonylureas – stimulate b-cells by inhibiting
the membrane-bound Kþ channel; the resulting
depolarization causes insulin release side effects
including weight gain and hypoglycaemia. This is
usually the second line of treatment. Examples of
this class of drugs are gliclazide and glimepiride.
• Acarbose inhibits intestinal enzymes, preventing the
digestion of starch, resulting in a slower rise in blood
glucose after a meal. Side effects include flatulence
and diarrhoea.
• Thiazolidinediones – drugs that promote insulin
sensitivity, and they are usually used in combination
with other drugs. They are contraindicated in people
with heart failure (they cause fluid retention) or at
higher risk of fractures. They are recommended as
a substitute second-line treatment instead of either
metformin or sulphonylureas. The only available glitazone is pioglitazone
• Gliptins, also called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4) – relatively new drug. Their mechanism
of action is not fully understood and is thought to be
as a result of increased incretin (GLP-1 and GIP)
levels, which results in inhibited glucagon, increased insulin secretion and therefore lower blood
glucose. Side effects include headaches, nausea and
nasopharyngitis. Its use as an additional treatment
after metformin or sulphonylureas is recommended. Currently sitagliptin and vildagliptin are
available for use.

5

Patients with type 2 diabetes are often treated
with insulin in a similar manner to those with type
1. This does not mean that they have developed
type 1. Insulin treatment helps to control blood
glucose, which has been proven to reduce
complications.

EXAMINATION OF THE
DIABETIC PATIENT
The presentation of the patient determines the examinations that will be preformed. All newly diagnosed diabetics will undergo a series of general examinations
(Fig. 5.14) and investigations that will be checked on
a regular basis as part of good clinical practice and ongoing management.
Undiagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes will
have a fairly typical presentation and will undergo
a series of routine tests to determine the cause of
their symptoms. They are not likely to require an
examination in the clinical setting unless they present with an associated problem. Possible presenting complaints that would require additional
examination:
•
•
•
•

Thrush – GU examination
Altered sensation – sensory examination
Abdominal pain – abdominal examination
Palpitations – cardiovascular examination.

Undiagnosed type 2 diabetics will present with a specific
problem and associated symptoms that will point to
the diagnosis. Possible presenting complaints and the
associated examinations:

• ‘Pins and needles/altered sensation – CNS examination noting extent of change
• Ulcers – foot examination and peripheral pulses
• Thrush – GU examination.

Hypoglycaemia in non-diabetic
patients
Most people should be able to tolerate fasting for several
days without developing hypoglycaemia. If a patient is
unable to do so then the mnemonic ‘EXPLAIN’ can be
useful:
•
•
•
•

EXogenous drugs (e.g. alcohol and insulin)
Pituitary insufficiency, growth hormone deficiency
Liver failure or defective liver enzymes
Addison’s disease – deficiency of cortisol that raises
blood glucose levels (Autoimmune causes)
• Insulinomas – a type of islet cell tumour (see below)
• Non-pancreatic tumour – by ectopic insulin secretion or excess glucose consumption.

Diabetes, pancreatic transplants
and stem cells
Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of
beta islet cells and type 2 can be as a result of those cells
failing to produce enough insulin to match rising resistance, possibly leading to them dying out.
Understanding the molecular biology of pancreatic
development and the pathology of diabetes is the main
way of advancing the management and possibly even
treatment of diabetes. Transplantation of islet cells is
Fig. 5.15 The action of leptin on
fertility. (FSH, follicle-stimulating
hormone; GnRH, gonadotrophinreleasing hormone; LH, luteinizing
hormone.)

an established protocol but the current supply of tissue
is outstripped by demand. Our understanding of certain
factors (e.g. Notch, sonic hedgehog and TGF-beta) is aimed
at devising a means to create new beta islet cells or regenerate existing cells in vivo. This could overcome the tissue
shortage as well as immunological complications of
transplantation. Alternatively, the use of stem cells to
re-grow specific cells or entire organs is developing and
this could be another treatment in the future (Fig. 5.15).

OTHER DISORDERS OF THE
PANCREAS

Endocrine pancreatic neoplasia
Tumours of the endocrine cells in the pancreas are
called islet cell tumours; they are usually benign and solitary, but they often secrete a specific hormone. Tumours are named according to the hormone they
secrete:
• Insulinomas are the most common type of islet
cell tumour. The excess insulin that they secrete
causes severe hypoglycaemic attacks, which can lead
to coma.
• Glucagonomas are very rare tumours that secrete
glucagon. They are often asymptomatic, but they
may cause diabetes mellitus.
Extremely infrequently, islet cell tumours can secrete
other hormones, such as gastrin in Zollinger–Ellison
syndrome. Other rare tumours can produce vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or adrenocorticotrophic
hormone (ACTH).

Metabolic syndrome/Syndrome X
Type 2 diabetes is often associated with hyperglycaemia,
hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and
central obesity (adipose tissue in an abdominal distribution). This collection of problems is collectively referred
to as the metabolic syndrome and is associated with an
increased risk of stroke and coronary heart disease, which
may be the result of hypertriglyceridaemia or hyperinsulinaemia. There are several theories about why these
factors cluster. Suggestions include simple genetic linkage, whilst others think that insulin resistance is the
initiating event, as it drives the synthesis of triglycerides

5

and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which in turn
lead to obesity and coronary vascular disease. Alternatively, as adipose tissue produces several hormones that
mediate insulin sensitivity, it may be obesity itself which
creates the metabolic syndrome. Growing adipocytes
produce tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a), which increases
insulin resistance. Adiponectin is produced by adipose
tissue and decreases insulin resistance but its levels decrease with obesity. Whilst the identification of a single
underlying cause remains elusive, the metabolic syndrome serves to highlight the importance of treating
other cardiac risk factors in diabetes patients.

the end of this chapter you should be able to:
Recall the constituents of the gut–brain axis
Describe the role of APUD cells
Describe the action of GI tract peptides and the stimuli for their release
Describe the structure and function of the pineal gland and the role it plays in jet lag.

This chapter describes several tissues whose endocrine
functions are still being realized:

• Adiposity signals – leptin and adiponectin
• Growth – somatostatin.

• Gastrointestinal tract – secretes many hormones that
regulate digestive function. Some act locally as mediators, some travel through the blood to act on distant organs
• Pineal gland – secretes melatonin, which regulates
circadian rhythms.

Together, these hormones and the vagus nerve constitute the ‘gut–brain axis’. This intricate system relays information to the hypothalamus and brainstem about
energy homeostasis in the GI tract. The ‘gut–brain axis’
serves a number of functions:

ENDOCRINE CELLS IN THE
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

• Regulates food intake and appetite
• Regulates glucose and fat metabolism
• Regulates the secretion and sensitivity of GI tract
hormones.

Enteroendocrine cells are the product of one of the four
stem-cell lineages that exist within intestinal epithelium
and are considered to be part of the ‘diffuse endocrine
system’. They secrete a variety of peptides, in different
combinations, in response to stimuli reflecting nutrient
consumption and utilization (e.g. intestinal distension
or chemical stimuli) both locally in the intestine and
systemically. They potentiate or inhibit the release
and action of each other. The main peptides will be considered individually below but the role of these peptides
in concert is just beginning to emerge and this complex
system may have a significant role to play in the treatment of obesity and diabetes in the future.
Some GI tract peptides, e.g. vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin,
ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptides (PP), also act as
neurotransmitters in the CNS and the neurons that innervate the GI tract (called the enteric nervous system).
The following functions are regulated in the CNS by
these peptide neurotransmitters:

They are also called neuroendocrine cells, due to
their secretion of both neurotransmitters and ‘hormones’. The following cells are examples of APUD
cells:

• Biological rhythms – VIP
• Orexigenic (stimulate appetite) – ghrelin
• Anorexigenic (reduce appetite) – CCK, glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP- 1), oxyntomodulin (OXM), peptide
tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and PP

• Islets of Langerhans cells which secrete insulin and
glucagon
• Enteroendocrine cells (see below)
• Parafollicular cells which secrete calcitonin; they are
found in the thyroid gland

THE APUD CONCEPT
APUD cells are a group of endocrine cells that secrete
small peptide hormones in many tissues throughout
the body. The name ‘APUD’ (amine precursor uptake
and decarboxylation) reflects the conversion of actively
absorbed amine precursors into amino acids, which are
used to make peptide hormones. These cells are linked
by three features:
• Appearance under an electron microscope (e.g. neurosecretory granules)
• Biochemical pathway for amine or peptide hormone
synthesis
• Embryological origin is from neural crest cells,
which migrate to foregut and other locations.

69

Up and coming hormones
• Juxtaglomerular complex that secretes renin; found
in kidneys
• Neuroendocrine cells of the respiratory tract which
secrete serotonin and calcitonin.

Gastrin
Gastrin is predominantly secreted by G cells in the antrum of the stomach after a meal. It is secreted in response to:
•

•
•

GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
PEPTIDES
The major peptides secreted by the GI tract are described
below. Figs 6.1 and 6.2 show the location of GI tract peptide release and the major actions of four GI tract hormones. The actions of other peptides are shown in Fig. 6.3.

Delivery
GI tract peptides reach their target cells via two means:
• Endocrine – via blood
• Paracrine – act locally to affect nearby cells.
Some peptides have both endocrine and paracrine functions, e.g. somatostatin.

Peptides or amino acids in the stomach
Vagal stimulation (i.e. parasympathetic)
Stomach distension
Gastrin releasing peptide.

It acts to increase protein breakdown, specifically by:
• Stimulating enterochromaffin-like cells to secrete histamine. This acts on histamine-2 receptors (H2) of parietal cells in the stomach to promote the release of
hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor
• Stimulating the release of hydrochloric acid directly
through its action on the CCK receptors of parietal
cells
• Stimulating parietal cell maturation and growth of
the mucosa
• Stimulating chief cells to secrete pepsinogen
• Stimulating pancreatic hormone secretion

Up and coming hormones
• Promoting gastric motility
• Relaxing the pyloric and ileocecal sphincters.
Patients presenting with recurrent peptic ulcers,
especially if there is a family history of endocrine
cancers, should be investigated for Zollinger–Ellison
syndrome. These patients have gastrin-producing
pancreatic adenomas or islet hyperplasia, which causes
excessive release of gastrin, over-stimulation of parietal
cells, acidification of stomach contents and destruction
and ulceration of the stomach mucosa.

Secretin
Secretin is secreted by the S cells of the duodenum and the
small intestine in response to low pH in the duodenum
and other luminal contents, including ethanol and products of protein metabolism. It neutralizes gastric acid by:
• Stimulating pancreatic secretion of fluid and bicarbonate ions (HCO3 )
• Inhibiting acid secretion from the parietal cells in the
stomach.

Cholecystokinin
CCK is secreted by I cells in the duodenum and jejunum
in response to fatty acids, lipids and certain amino acids.
It is also found in the brain. It primarily increases the
breakdown of fat by:
• Stimulating pancreatic enzyme and fluid secretion
• Stimulating gallbladder contraction and release of
bile into the duodenum
• Potentiating the actions of secretin
• Causing some bicarbonate ion release from the
pancreas
• Delaying gastric emptying
• Producing a sensation of satiety (fullness), causing a
decrease in appetite.

Ghrelin
This is a peptide secreted by P/D1 cells in the fundus of
the stomach that:
• Stimulates appetite
• Stimulates growth hormone release from the anterior pituitary
• Decreases insulin secretion
• Stimulates gastric motility, gastric emptying and acid
secretion.
Ghrelin levels rise before meals, stimulating appetite
through its action on the hypothalamus. Levels drop
after meals. Apart from the short-term effects, ghrelin
may also contribute to long-term regulation of weight.
This may have clinical implications in the future.

Adiponectin
Adiponectin is a collagen-like protein hormone secreted by adipose tissue. Plasma levels are inversely
proportional to weight. It exhibits the following
actions:
• Anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects.
It prevents the formation of atherosclerotic plaques
• Anti-diabetic effects. Promotes insulin sensitivity.
Low levels of adiponectin are found in patients with
excess abdominal and visceral fat. This is associated
with a number of conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Obesity
Type 2 diabetes
Dyslipidaemia
Hypertension
Atherosclerosis
Metabolic syndrome.

The further elucidation of the pathophysiological role
of adiponectin in these conditions may yield therapeutic applications for their treatment in the future.

Both leptin and insulin act as long-term adiposity signals, regulating body weight. Leptin is produced predominantly by white adipose tissue in direct
proportion to the amount of body fat present. Leptin
therefore communicates the status of energy stores to
the hypothamalus. Its actions include:
• Increasing satiety, which reduces appetite. This decreases food intake. This is brought about by actions
on the hypothalamus
• Controlling energy expenditure
• Enhancing the effects of short-term satiety signals,
e.g. CCK, GLP-1.

72

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by L cells in
the ileum of the small intestine in response to nutrient
ingestion. It has a number of actions:
•
•
•
•

Enhances insulin release after oral glucose ingestion
Suppresses glucagon release
Delays gastric emptying and acid secretion
May improve insulin sensitivity and restore b-cell
mass in the pancreas
• Promotes satiety in the brain.
Unlike insulin, GLP-1 causes a decrease in weight. Due
to its insulinotrophic effect, GLP-1 agonists have been
developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Examples
include exenatide and liraglutide.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors

Insulin and glucagon

GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4). This has somewhat limited the development of GLP-1 analogues. By blocking the action
of DPP-4, the breakdown of endogenous GLP-1 is prevented, thereby prolonging its action. Examples include
sitagliptin and vildagliptin. These are used to treat type 2
diabetes.

Insulin and glucagon are both peptides secreted by
enteroendocrine cells in the pancreas. The important
functions they perform are described in Chapter 5.

Glucose-dependent
insulinotrophic peptide

Macrostructure

Glucose-dependent insulinotrophic peptide (GIP), also
called gastric inhibitory peptide, is secreted by the
enteroendocrine K cells of the duodenum and jejunum
in response to fats and carbohydrates. It acts to:
• Stimulate insulin secretion
• Inhibit gastric acid production and gastric motility.
This may have therapeutic applications for type 2 diabetes
in the future.

Somatostatin
Somatostatin is secreted mainly by the d cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas but also by D cells in
the stomach and duodenum. It is also secreted by the
hypothalamus where it is called growth-hormoneinhibiting hormone (GHIH), and it inhibits the release
of growth hormone and TSH. In the intestine, secretion
is stimulated by:
•
•
•
•

PINEAL GLAND

Structure
The pineal gland coordinates circadian (daily) rhythms
of dark–light (day–night) cycles by secreting the hormone melatonin. Darkness stimulates its release.
It is a small gland found at the posterior end of the
corpus callosum, forming a section of the roof in the
posterior wall of the third ventricle (Fig. 6.4).
The pineal gland begins to calcify after puberty, making it a useful midline marker in X-rays and computed
tomography (CT) scans.

Microstructure
The pineal gland is composed of two main types of neural cell:
• Pinealocytes – specialized secretory neurons
• Glial support cells.
In keeping with all endocrine organs, it has a very rich
blood supply that forms a network of capillaries

Low pH and amino acids in the stomach

Somatostatin acts to slow down digestion by:

It may also play a role in the regulation of appetite
and food intake, which could have implications for
the treatment of obesity.

Regulation

Jet lag and melatonin treatment

In the absence of light signals, circadian rhythms still exist but are not synchronized with the day–night cycle.
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus serves as an ‘intrinsic clock’, which interacts with
an external rhythm stimulus (or Zeitgeber), in this case
light, to coordinate melatonin release with the external
day–night cycle. This system allows the conversion of
inhibitory light stimuli into a hormonal stimulus that
can regulate:

The pineal gland has evolved to allow adaptation to
changing day length (i.e. seasons). However, resetting
of the SCN is best demonstrated by a jet flight in the following way:

Effects of melatonin

• When a person leaves his or her home country the
SCN and pineal gland are synchronized: at night,
darkness and SCN activation stimulate melatonin
production, inducing sleep.
• If the person flies across time zones, the SCN continues to oscillate in accordance with the previous
time zone, which means that the timing of melatonin production (and, therefore, tiredness) does not
change.
• At a rate of adjustment of a couple of hours a day, the
SCN adapts to the new time zone.

Melatonin has three main effects, which collectively
serve to synchronize body physiology with environmental levels of light and darkness:

Melatonin may also have therapeutic applications
in the treatment of a range of other conditions,
including:

• It induces sleep (hypnotic effect)
• It resets the SCN
• It influences the hypothalamus, affecting behaviour.

• Alzheimer’s disease
• Headaches
• Mood disorders.

• Day and night (circadian rhythm)
• Seasonal breeding rhythms (e.g. in deer, birds)
• Hibernation in animals.

Circadian rhythms influence almost every cell in the
body. Hormones are secreted from the hypothalamus,
pituitary gland and gonads with a circadian rhythm,
e.g. secretion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone
(CRH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
peak early in the morning. These variations in hormone levels throughout the day are thought to be determined by the actions of the SCN and the pineal
gland. The regulation and actions of melatonin are
shown in Fig. 6.5.

74

Taking oral melatonin can shorten the period of jet
lag. Melatonin should be taken at the times of
darkness in the new time zone whilst on the plane
and for several days at the destination. For shift work,
the melatonin should be taken during the period of
desired sleep. The SCN is reset more quickly and the
body becomes resynchronized.

Endocrine control of fluid
balance

Objectives
By the end of this chapter you should be able to:
• Recall the hormones responsible for maintaining fluid balance
• Describe the action of the hormones responsible for maintaining fluid balance and the factors which
stimulate their release
• Describe the significance of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
• Describe the aetiology, signs and symptoms of disordered fluid balance.

Fluid balance is important in maintaining appropriate
perfusion of vital organs, in determining electrolyte concentrations and in meeting the body’s demand for water.
Humans have evolved to consume and store an excess of
water at meal times, rather than being subject to constant
thirst. Using this supply of water the body is able to adapt
to demand by regulating renal water excretion. Changes
in plasma concentration and plasma volume stimulate
the release of hormones which regulate sodium and water reabsorption in the kidney. The variable reabsorption
of sodium and water allows the body to be restored to
equilibrium after fluid balance shifts outside the normal
range. As blood pressure is affected by fluid balance,
many of these hormones are also vasoactive. The main
hormones involved in regulating fluid balance are:
• Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) – from the posterior
pituitary gland (Fig. 7.1)
• Renin – from the kidney (Fig. 7.2)
• Aldosterone – from the adrenal cortex (Fig. 7.2).
An understanding of fluid balance is essential in medicine as it is a component in the management of many
common conditions, e.g. heart failure and hypertension.

FLUID BALANCE

The importance of water
Water is needed for many normal physiological
processes and is essential for all biochemical reactions.
Water is contained in different compartments of the
body, each containing a slightly different composition.
There are two main fluid compartments in the body:
• Intracellular – makes up approx. 2/3 of total body
water
• Extracellular – makes up approx. 1/3 of total body
water.

Extracellular fluid (ECF) is further subdivided into
blood plasma (makes up approx. ¼ of ECF) and interstitial fluid (makes up approx. 3/4 of ECF). Interstitial
fluid refers to fluid that bathes cells, CSF, intestinal fluid
and fluid contained in joints.
This is the normal composition for an average 70-kg
person; the amount of water in the body varies according to age, gender, and notably the amount of adipose
tissue. As adipose tissue increases, total body water
decreases.
All homeostatic mechanisms that regulate fluid balance respond to the composition of ECF. Receptors can
only monitor plasma volume and osmotic concentration.

The importance of sodium
Fluid balance is intimately linked to sodium balance.
Sodium ions are osmotically active (water follows sodium across cell membranes) and they are present in
large quantities within the body. The normal plasma
concentration of sodium ions is 135–145 mmol/L.
In the kidney, variable water reabsorption is enabled
by the kidney’s ability to reabsorb variable amounts
of sodium ions and, under certain conditions, by its
ability to allow water to move more freely across cell
membranes.

The importance of fluid volume
In addition to the maintenance of an adequate water
supply, fluid balance, in particular, fluid volume is a
key determinant of blood pressure. In order to ensure
organs are adequately perfused the body is able to adapt
to changes in fluid volume by adjusting:
• Cardiac output (i.e. stroke volume and rate)
• Peripheral resistance (i.e. vasodilatation
vasoconstriction).

Fluid balance involves the trade-off between fluid intake
and fluid output, and the maintenance of the composition of the fluid.

Fluid intake
Water intake varies according to activity and climate,
but around 2.5 L per day is required for normal functioning. Most of this is obtained by ingesting fluid. This
comes in the form of food and drink and is often unconsciously acquired at meal times.
Fluid intake is determined by the sensation of thirst.
Thirst is stimulated by the thirst centre in the hypothalamus. It contains osmoreceptors which monitor the osmolarity of the plasma. When plasma osmolarity increases or
plasma volume decreases, thirst is the sensation which is
produced and which causes us to consciously desire water.
Thirst can also be stimulated directly by angiotensin
II and aldosterone which are closely linked to fluid balance in the kidney.

Water is mainly excreted by the kidney in the form of
urine. Fluid is also excreted in faeces and sweat, and
evaporates from the lungs and skin. The latter form
brought about by evaporation is called ‘insensible’ fluid
loss as we are unconsciously aware of the loss. Solutes
are not lost in ‘insensible’ fluid, it is water only.
The total blood volume is about 5 L for a person of
average weight and height. The kidneys filter this volume of blood about once every 5 minutes. Water and
sodium are filtered into the kidney tubules by the glomeruli but most is reabsorbed back into the blood. Sodium ions are actively reabsorbed, while water passively
follows the sodium by osmosis. Any sodium or water
that is not reabsorbed is excreted in the urine.
Fluid balance can be regulated in the kidneys by altering two factors:
• Sodium reabsorption
• Permeability of the tubules to water.

Hormones involved in fluid balance

Factors that regulate fluid balance
Fluid balance is regulated by controlling the intake and
excretion of water and sodium. Hormones regulate this
balance by acting on:
• Thirst – detected and stimulated by the hypothalamus
• Volume and concentration of water excreted in the
urine
• Peripheral resistance, which affects blood
pressure.
There are three main hormones that regulate fluid balance; their sites and actions on the kidney nephron are
shown in Fig. 7.4:
• Antidiuretic hormone (ADH; vasopressin) – regulates osmolarity of body fluids by conserving water.
Also a potent vasoconstrictor
• Renin – stimulates angiotensin II synthesis and aldosterone release. Effects an increase in peripheral resistance in response to low arterial blood pressure,
low plasma sodium levels or increased sympathetic
activity
• Angiotensin II – conserves sodium and, as a result,
water. Also a potent vasoconstrictor
• Aldosterone – conserves sodium and, as a result, water. Also a potent vasoconstrictor.
The following hormones, nerves and chemical factors
are released in particular states and may modify the biological response to the former hormones, or act synergistically with them:
• Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)

HORMONES INVOLVED IN
FLUID BALANCE

Antidiuretic hormone
This is the main hormone responsible for controlling
volume of urine production. ADH acts on the kidney
to conserve water. It increases the permeability of
the distal tubule and collecting ducts to water, resulting in more water being reabsorbed and hence
more concentrated urine production. ADH is also a
potent vasoconstrictor. ADH regulates fluid balance
by influencing the movement of water directly,
not through sodium movement. Its main role is in
maintaining water balance and not plasma volume.
The regulation and actions of ADH are shown in
Fig. 7.1.

Synthesis and secretion
ADH is a polypeptide hormone synthesized by neurosecretory cells in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is transported along their axons to
the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored in vesicles. This process is described in more detail in
Chapter 2.

Endocrine control of fluid balance
ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland in response to stimuli which reflect a loss of intravascular
water:
• High plasma osmolarity (concentrated blood). This
is the more potent stimulus to ADH secretion
• Fall in blood pressure, which is detected by cardiac
and large blood vessel baroreceptors.
ADH is rapidly degraded by the liver and kidney,
enabling tight control of water balance.

Intracellular actions
ADH acts on G-protein-linked vasopressin receptors
(V receptors) found on the cell surface of target cells.
These target cells are found in two tissue types:
• Blood vessels – ADH acts on V1 receptors causing
smooth muscle contraction (i.e. vasoconstriction).
Inositol triphosphate (IP3) is the second messenger
in this reaction
• Kidney – ADH acts on V2 receptors in the kidney.
This uses cAMP as a second messenger. In response
to cAMP, aquaporins which are normally contained in cytoplasm vesicles fuse with the apical
membrane and allow water to pass freely through
the cell (the basolateral cell membrane is freely
permeable to water). When cAMP is degraded,
the aquaporin is removed from the apical cell
membrane.

Effects
On the kidneys
ADH is secreted in response to high blood osmolarity. It
increases the reabsorption of water at the kidney by increasing the permeability of the distal tubule and collecting duct. This water reabsorption is independent
of sodium levels and therefore blood osmolarity can
be decreased. Concentrated urine is produced.

On the blood vessels
ADH is also secreted in response to low blood volume.
It causes arteriolar vasoconstriction, which increases peripheral resistance and raises blood pressure. This action
is not usually involved in the regulation of blood pressure, but it is an important response to hypovolaemia in
severe haemorrhage.

Deficiency and excess
ADH deficiency causes diabetes insipidus, in which excess dilute urine is produced, causing fluid dehydration,
and high plasma osmolarity due to hypernatraemia.
ADH excess is called the ‘syndrome of inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone secretion and results in water
retention’.
Both of these conditions are described in more detail
in Chapter 2.

78

ADH secretion is inhibited by alcohol, causing large
volumes of dilute urine to be excreted, resulting in
dehydration the next morning.

The renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system
The renin–angiotensin II–aldosterone system acts to
maintain normal blood volume and blood pressure of
the ECF.
Renin is produced by the kidney in response to low
tubular sodium content or low perfusion pressure, and
causes the release of angiotensin II, which in turn causes
secretion of aldosterone. Angiotensin II causes sodium
reabsorption and consequently water reabsorption in
the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Angiotensin II also causes peripheral vasoconstriction,
thereby increasing peripheral resistance, and raising
blood pressure. The regulation and actions of angiotensin II are shown in Fig. 7.4.
Aldosterone causes the reabsorption of sodium and
therefore water in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, and the secretion of potassium at the same
sites.

Synthesis and secretion of renin
Renin is a small peptide enzyme secreted by the cells of
the juxtaglomerular complex of the kidney. This complex is made of three cell types (Fig. 7.5):
• Juxtaglomerular cells – part of the afferent glomerular arteriole which secretes renin in response to a
fall in sodium. Also responds to beta1 adrenergic
activation which occurs when arterial blood pressure falls
• Macula densa – composed of chemoreceptor cells
which monitor chloride ions in the distal convoluted tubule. This reflects the concentration of sodium ions in the tubule
• Extraglomerular mesangial cells – glomerular support cells that control blood flow in the afferent glomerular arteriole.
Renin release is also controlled by potassium levels, angiotensin II and ANP.
Renin release is stimulated by:
• Low blood pressure at the kidney
• Low tubular sodium levels
• Hypokalaemia.
Renin release is inhibited by:
• High blood pressure at the kidney
• High tubular sodium levels
• Hyperkalaemia.

tubule.)

Effects of renin
Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that acts on the plasma
protein angiotensinogen which is synthesized by the
liver. It cleaves this protein to form angiotensin I,
which is then rapidly converted into angiotensin II
by the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) which is found in vascular beds, especially in
the lungs. ACE inhibitors are a class of drug which
are used to treat hypertension. Their effects are
mediated by blocking the conversion of angiotensin
I to angiotensin II by ACE.

Haemorrhage, dehydration, salt loss and renal
artery stenosis all generate a stimulus for the
juxtaglomerular cells to secrete renin. In most
cases, this is a useful response to conserve water.
However, in renal artery stenosis, the response is
maladaptive and results in inappropriate sodium and
water retention. Prostaglandins are involved in
regulating the tone of the renal arterioles. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs, such as
ibuprofen, inhibit prostaglandins, which can lead to
renin release and resultant sodium and water
retention.

Angiotensin II has four important actions which serve to
increase blood volume and pressure to appropriate
levels:
• Stimulating aldosterone release from the adrenal
cortex, which activates the pumps in the proximal tubule to increase sodium reabsorption, thereby increasing water reabsorption
• Peripheral vasoconstriction to raise blood pressure
• Stimulating sensation of thirst in the hypothalamus
• Inhibiting renin release (negative feedback).
Thus angiotensin II conserves sodium and water and
raises blood pressure.
ACE inhibitors reduce blood volume and peripheral
resistance by blocking the synthesis of angiotensin II
by ACE. Both actions reduce blood pressure, so these
drugs are useful in the treatment of hypertension and
heart failure. ACE inhibitors also act on other substrates including kinins (e.g. bradykinin), which are
thought to contribute to the hypotensive effect. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) do not affect kinin
levels and are also used to treat hypertension. They
are often used when side effects from ACE inhibitors
are intolerable.

A persistent dry cough is a common side effect of
ACE inhibitors that is caused by the decreased
degradation of bradykinin in the lungs. Bradykinin
is usually broken down by ACE.

Aldosterone
Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid synthesized by the
zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex. The main
stimulus for secretion is angiotensin II. Other factors
that inhibit the synthesis of aldosterone include heparin, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and dopamine. Aldosterone causes the conservation of sodium and water. It
regulates extracellular volume and potassium levels in
the blood. See Chapter 4 for a complete description
of aldosterone and the associated disorders. The regulation and actions of aldosterone are shown in Figs 7.2
and 7.4.
Aldosterone receptors are also found in the
colon, illustrating its importance in regulating fluid
levels.

Intracellular actions
Aldosterone acts on intracellular receptors in the distal
convoluted tubule of the kidney. It causes sodium to be
reabsorbed in exchange for potassium. Water follows
this movement.

79

Endocrine control of fluid balance
Effects
Aldosterone is secreted in response to high potassium
levels or low blood volume through the actions of renin
and angiotensin II. It acts to conserve sodium and water,
thereby preventing its further release by negative feedback.

Natriuretic peptides also cause dilation of veins, which
reduces preload on the heart and therefore reduces
cardiac output. They also cause arterial vasodilation,
which decreases vascular resistance and therefore
afterload on the heart; this reduces blood pressure.

Kinins
OTHER HORMONES INVOLVED IN
THE REGULATION OF FLUID
BALANCE

Natriuretic factors
Natriuresis is the excretion of large amounts of sodium
in the urine. Diuresis is the production of large amounts
of urine. Natriuretic factors have a diuretic effect, the opposite effect of ADH, angiotensin II and aldosterone.
They increase sodium excretion, resulting in concomitant water excretion. This causes blood volume to decrease and blood pressure to drop. Natriuretic factors
act as an ‘escape mechanism’ to prevent excessive water
retention. Inappropriate natriuresis leads to a salt-losing
syndrome entailing dehydration, hypotension and even
sudden death.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)
ANP is a polypeptide hormone synthesized and stored
in atrial myocytes and released in response to cardiac
muscle distension due to high blood volume and fluid
overload. ANP levels are a good indicator of hypervolaemic states, which occur in conditions such as congestive
heart failure. A more sensitive diagnostic indicator of
heart failure is BNP and NT-pro-BNP (which is a byproduct of BNP synthesis). These are synthesized by the
ventricles (and also the brain, where they were discovered). Serum natriuretic peptides (especially BNP and
NT-pro-BNP) should be measured in any patient with
clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure. The serum
level helps to guide management and dictates the severity of heart failure. Serum levels of BNP in particular correlate closely with prognosis in patients with congestive
heart failure.
The main actions of natriuretic peptides are to stimulate natriuresis and diuresis by the kidney which
lowers blood pressure. They do this by:
• Increasing the glomerular filtration rate. This is
brought about by vasodilation of the afferent arteriole
and vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole of the glomerulus, increasing hydrostatic pressure in the capsule
• Decreasing sodium and water reabsorption by the
kidneys
• Inhibiting renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone
release.

80

Kinins are potent vasoactive polypeptides formed in the
blood vessels by the action of kallikrein on the precursor
kininogen. They act in the kidney to:
• Inhibit the action of ADH
• Stimulate vasodilation in most vessels, but vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature
• Stimulate prostaglandin synthesis
• Decrease sodium reabsorption.

Renal prostaglandins
Renal prostaglandins are locally acting lipid molecules
synthesized by kidney cells. They act in the kidney to:
• Inhibit the action of ADH and aldosterone
• Stimulate vasodilatation in the kidney.

Dopamine
Dopamine is an amine synthesized in the proximal tubules. It acts in the kidney to:
• Inhibit tubular Naþ/Kþ-ATPase and decrease sodium reabsorption
• Induce renal vasodilatation, thereby increasing renal
bloodflow, glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis and
diuresis.

DISORDERS OF FLUID BALANCE
A deficiency of water is called dehydration, which may
or may not be accompanied by sodium deficiency. The
causes and effects of dehydration are shown in Fig. 7.6.
An excess of water is called fluid retention, which may
or may not be accompanied by an excess of sodium. The
causes and effects of fluid retention are shown in Fig. 7.7.
Intravenous fluid replacement in patients otherwise
unable to acquire fluids is essential. Normal daily fluid
requirements (2400 mL) must be maintained and, in
addition, extraordinary losses from haemorrhage,
vomit or other causes must be restored. The principal
fluid categories are crystalloids, colloids and blood
products. Crystalloids include normal saline (0.9%),
which is used to replace water and sodium but longterm use results in a drop in oncotic pressure and
interstitial fluid accumulation (oedema).

Describe what happens when blood calcium levels rise and fall
Describe the actions of the hormones responsible for maintaining calcium homeostasis

homeostasis
• Define osteoporosis and osteopenia and recall the risk factors for developing osteoporosis
• Describe the principles of management of osteoporosis.

Hormones play an important role in the regulation of
several mineral ions, notably calcium, phosphate and
magnesium. Calcium is a cofactor for enzymatic reactions, a common intracellular signalling molecule and
is essential for nerve conduction and skeletal, cardiac
and smooth muscle contraction. It is also required for
the release of neurotransmitters and both endocrine
and exocrine hormones. Serum calcium levels must
be tightly regulated to maintain these processes and prevent complications such as cardiac arrest. Hormones
serve to maintain calcium homeostasis through their actions on the uptake of calcium in the intestines, release
of calcium from the bone and excretion of calcium
through the kidneys.
Blood calcium levels are regulated by three hormones (Fig. 8.1):
• Parathyroid hormone (PTH) – raises blood calcium
levels
• Calcitonin – reduces blood calcium by increasing excretion of calcium
• Vitamin D3 and its metabolite calcitriol – raise calcium intake from the gastrointestinal tract.
Blood calcium levels in the extracellular fluid (ECF)
are kept within a very narrow range to maintain normal physiological processes. The two main hormones
responsible for this are PTH and calcitonin which have
opposing actions. They act on the free, ionized calcium
in the blood. Calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid cells monitor serum calcium and release PTH
in response to falling serum calcium levels. PTH has
three target organs: the intestine, bone and kidneys.
These effector organs act to increase serum calcium
in response to PTH. An excess or deficiency of this
hormone can cause hyper- and hypocalcaemia,
respectively.

Important words:
Hyperparathyroidism: an excess of parathyroid
hormone
Osteoclast: a cell that breaks down bone, releasing
calcium
Osteoblast: a cell that lays down bone using calcium
Reabsorption: when substances are reclaimed from the
kidney tubule after being filtered out of the blood.

THE ROLE OF CALCIUM
Calcium is a mineral obtained from the diet and excreted by the kidneys. Ninety-nine per cent of the total
body calcium is in bone. The remaining 1% can be exchanged freely between plasma and the extracellular
and intracellular compartments.
Calcium is essential for:
• Bone mineralization, acting in concert with phosphate ions (PO4–)
• Skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle contraction
• All processes that involve exocytosis, including synaptic transmission and hormone release
• Enzymatic reactions
• Intracellular signalling.
The processes requiring calcium are described in
Fig. 8.2.
Forty per cent of serum calcium is bound to albumin,
a further 10% is bound to other proteins and the rest is
in an unbound ionized form. Unbound ionized calcium (Ca2 þ) is physiologically active and is the only
component of blood calcium under direct influence
of calcium-controlling hormones. It is the ionized

Calcium balance is calculated as absorbed calcium minus excreted calcium. This balance is affected by age and
some diseases:

calcium which is most important. Normal levels are
1.0–1.25 mmol/L.
The amount of ionized calcium is affected by:

• Children usually have a positive calcium balance;
this allows bones to grow.
• In adults, input and output should be the same.
• Postmenopausal women tend to have a negative calcium balance (i.e. calcium is lost).

• Blood pH – calcium binding is reduced by low pH (acidosis) and increased by high pH (alkalosis). This increases and decreases free ionized calcium, respectively.

MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN
CALCIUM HOMEOSTASIS

Calcium intake
The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of calcium is
1 g for normal adults, 1.2 g for pregnant women. If an
individual is effectively maintaining the calcium

Calcium levels must be maintained within tight limits
and the normal range of total serum calcium is 2.12–
2.65 mmol/L. Dietary intake is variable, so the body
must be able to adapt to increased or reduced plasma
calcium. Calcium regulation involves the loss or gain
of calcium via three tissues: kidneys, intestines and
bones.
The movements and distribution of calcium in the
body are shown in Fig. 8.3. The movements are regulated by the three hormones discussed below.

PTH is synthesized by the chief cells in the parathyroid
glands. The four small glands are located on the posterior surface of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland. The
principal effects of PTH are to increase serum calcium
and reduce serum phosphate.
PTH is released in response to falling blood calcium
levels. Its actions are to raise calcium levels back to their
normal physiological concentration. Once blood calcium levels are restored to within the normal range,
PTH production is inhibited.
Increases in blood phosphate also stimulate PTH release indirectly by binding to ionized calcium and
thereby reducing its ‘concentration’.

Parathyroid glands
Bone structures are dynamic and bone is constantly
being broken down and remodelled.

Forty per cent of plasma calcium is bound to albumin.
Diseases that lower plasma albumin (e.g. cirrhosis or myeloma) can increase unbound (i.e. active) calcium levels,

Blood supply, nerves and lymphatics
The parathyroid glands are four oval-shaped structures
about 5 mm across; they are embedded in the thyroid
capsule behind both lateral lobes. These glands are described as superior and inferior pairs. The number of
parathyroid glands often varies between two and six

There are three cell types in the parathyroid glands:

Development
The parathyroid glands are endodermal structures that
develop from the pharyngeal pouches. The inferior
parathyroid glands are formed by the dorsal portion
of the third pouch, while the dorsal portion of the
fourth pouch forms the superior parathyroid glands.

Parathyroid hormone
Synthesis and receptors
PTH is a polypeptide hormone composed of 84 amino
acids. Falling plasma ionized calcium and low plasma
ionized calcium trigger the release of PTH from vesicles,
up-regulation of PTH transcription and, under conditions of chronic hypocalcaemia, can stimulate the chief
cells to proliferate. Under normal conditions, calcium inhibits PTH release at near-maximal capacity. The system is
therefore well-suited to adapt to a sudden fall more than a
sudden rise in plasma calcium. Chief cells also possess a
circadian rhythm, releasing PTH in a pulsatile manner.
PTH acts via G-protein-linked receptors on the cell
surface. These receptors are found on osteoblasts, renal
tubule cells and cells in the intestinal epithelium. The
receptors use cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a second messenger
to regulate the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. These proteins are either activated or deactivated
as a result; this brings about the effects of PTH.

Actions
PTH is the most important regulator of blood calcium
levels. The actions of PTH on calcium regulation are
shown in Fig. 8.5.

On the kidneys
PTH has three major effects:
• Increase of calcium ion reabsorption by stimulating
active uptake in the distal convoluted tubule and
thick ascending limb
• Increase of phosphate ion excretion by inhibiting uptake in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. This
causes more ionized calcium to be free in the circulation
• Stimulation of 1a-hydroxylase, an enzyme that
activates vitamin D.

Fig. 8.5 Actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the kidney

On the bones
PTH causes the release of calcium and phosphate from
the bone. PTH stimulates osteoblast proliferation and
differentiation and therefore increases bone production. PTH receptors are not found on osteoclasts but
these cells are stimulated indirectly by factors released
by the activated osteoblasts. Up-regulation of osteoclastic activity causes increased bone breakdown. The resultant increase in bone turnover can have different effects
on net bone mass but always results in increased serum
calcium. The actions are:
•
•
•
•

Direct inhibition of osteoblast collagen synthesis
Indirect stimulation of osteoclast bone erosion
Increased collagenase synthesis to erode the bone
Increased hydrogen ion release to create an acidic environment to enhance bone erosion.

On the intestines
PTH may have a direct action on calcium absorption in
the upper small intestine, but this is unproven. The
major effects are indirect, by stimulating 1a-hydroxylase. This causes the production of calcitriol, which
promotes calcium and phosphate reabsorption in the
intestine.
Although PTH causes increased mobilization of
phosphate, due to the PTH-mediated excretion of phosphate in the kidney, the overall effect is to reduce serum
phosphate levels.

Hormones involved in calcium homeostasis

Vitamin D
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is absorbed by the small intestine as part of the diet (e.g. dairy food) or is synthesized
from cholesterol in the skin. Vitamin D3 synthesis requires
ultraviolet B (UVB) light, usually derived from the sun. It
is then converted into calcitriol. Calcitriol is the biologically active form of vitamin D and is a major determinant
of intestinal calcium and phosphate reabsorption.

Activation
Human vitamin D is an inactive steroid called cholecalciferol (or vitamin D3); this fat-soluble steroid is stored
in adipose tissue. Two reactions must take place in different organs to activate vitamin D; they are shown in
Fig. 8.6.
The activated vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) molecule is shown in Fig. 8.7. It can be inactivated
by 24-hydroxylase found in the kidney. This enzyme catalyses the formation of 1,24,25-trihydroxycholecalciferol, which is rapidly excreted.
All forms of vitamin D are transported in the blood
by a specific plasma protein (transcalciferin). Vitamin D
is fat-soluble, so it can cross cell membranes. It acts via

25-hydroxylase in liver

25 (OH) vitamin D3
+

specific intracellular receptors that are found in the
same locations as PTH receptors.

Actions
The actions of vitamin D on calcium regulation are
shown in Fig. 8.8.

On the intestines
The main action of vitamin D (calcitriol) is stimulation
of active calcium and phosphate absorption in the duodenum and jejunum. The exact mechanism is unclear;
however, it is thought that Ca2 þ-ATPase is up-regulated
and transcription of a calcium-binding protein (calbindin) is stimulated by vitamin D (calcitriol). This makes
the intestine more permeable to calcium. This action on
the intestines takes a long time to produce an effect, so it
does not raise calcium levels immediately.

On the kidney
Activated vitamin D has three effects:
• Increase of calcium reabsorption in the proximal
and distal convoluted tubule
• Increase of phosphate reabsorption in the proximal
convoluted tubule
• Inhibition of 1a-hydroxylase activity. This is a form
of negative feedback.

Vitamin D affects bone remodelling by modulating calcium levels and by directly stimulating osteoblast activity (and indirectly osteoclasts). This brings about the
conditions of high calcium and phosphate optimum
for bone mineralization. Disorders of vitamin D absorption or activation can result in inadequate mineralization of bones (rickets in children or osteomalacia in
adults). If this is due to kidney disease, it is called renal
osteodystrophy (discussed later).

Calcitonin
Calcitonin is secreted by the parafollicular cells (C cells)
in the thyroid gland. The development and anatomy of
this gland is described in Chapter 3. Calcitonin is secreted as blood calcium rises, and it lowers calcium
levels. It has actions antagonist to PTH. It is not essential
to life, but it acts to fine-tune blood calcium levels.

Synthesis and receptors
Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone that is formed by
the breakdown of a larger prohormone. Calcitonin is
stored in secretory vesicles, from which it is released
when blood calcium levels rise. Rising calcium is
detected by the same calcium-sensing receptor which
is present on parathyroid cells.

On the kidney
Calcitonin inhibits the reabsorption of calcium and
phosphate. These ions are excreted as a result.

On the bones
Calcitonin acts primarily on osteoclasts in the bone. It
inhibits these cells to prevent all stages of bone erosion.
This prevents calcium and phosphate release into the
blood, so their levels are lowered.
Calcitonin is not essential for calcium regulation,
and there are no clinical consequences of calcitonin deficiency or excess. Neither removal of the thyroid gland

balance significantly. Calcitonin is used therapeutically
to reduce pain associated with vertebral fractures and to
treat Paget’s disease (a condition of excessive bone
resorption).
Never give the antibiotic tetracycline to young children,
as it binds to calcium in their teeth, making them
yellow. In adults, milk should not be used to swallow
tablets of tetracycline.

Phosphate
Calcium and phosphate are regulated by similar
processes and together they constitute 65% of the
weight of bone. They form hydroxyapatite crystals,
which mineralize the bone and give it strength. Phosphate is also an essential component of nucleic acids,
phospholipid membranes, ATP and signalling molecules. PTH-induced bone resorption causes the release
of phosphate. However, phosphate lowers ionized calcium levels and therefore antagonizes the calciumraising ability of PTH. This potential antagonism is
overcome by PTH concomitantly exerting a strong
phosphaturic action, thereby keeping phosphate low
whilst trying to raise serum calcium.

DISORDERS OF CALCIUM
REGULATION
Since PTH is the most important hormone in calcium homeostasis, disorders of this system are grouped according
to their effect on PTH release. The two groups are:
• Hyperparathyroidism (excess of PTH)
• Hypoparathyroidism (deficiency of PTH).

Primary hyperparathyroidism
Primary hyperparathyroidism is excessive PTH release.
All the actions of PTH raise calcium levels, so hypercalcaemia (excess blood calcium) results. Hypercalcaemia
and excess PTH cause the symptoms shown in Fig. 8.10.
Prolonged hyperparathyroidism causes bone demineralization and softening, called osteomalacia in adults
and rickets in children. The symptoms and signs of these
diseases are shown in Fig. 8.11.
Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common
endocrine disorder (about 1 in 1000 people), and it is
especially common in postmenopausal women. The
main causes are:
• Parathyroid gland adenoma (80%)
• Diffuse parathyroid gland hyperplasia (15%).

8

Neoplastic chief cells are not inhibited by high calcium,
and consequently PTH secretion is unregulated. Malignant tumours of the parathyroid gland are very rare, but
they can be associated with other endocrine tumours in
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. These
are discussed in Chapter 10.
When clerking a patient with suspected hypercalcaemia,
remember: ‘Bones, stones, abdominal groans and
psychic moans’.

Diagnosis and treatment
Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually detected on
routine testing and is suspected if a patient has:
• Unexpected bone weakness
• Hypercalcaemia symptoms and signs
• Hypercalcaemia on a blood test with low phosphate
levels
• Dehydration
• Severe thirst.
It is investigated by:
• Blood test – measuring fasting serum calcium and
phosphate. This will show raised serum calcium
and reduced serum phosphate
• Measuring blood PTH (increased)
• Measuring renal function. This is often normal but
should be measured as a baseline
• Radiography may show subperiosteal bone resorption of the phalanges
• Radioisotope scanning or ultrasound of the parathyroid glands to detect adenomas
• Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase may be seen in
parathyroid bone disease
• 24-hour urinary calcium should be measured in
young patients who present with a moderate increase in serum calcium and PTH to exclude familial
hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia.
Additionally, an abdominal X-ray could be performed
to detect nephrocalcinosis or renal calculi due to
hypercalcaemia.
Medication should be reviewed. Common medications (e.g. lithium and thiazide diuretics) can cause
hypercalcaemia.
There are three treatment options:
• Restrict dietary calcium and vitamin D, and encourage adequate hydration
• Drug treatment (e.g. calcitonin, bisphosphonates,
cinacalcet in certain patients). This is reserved for patients who do not fulfil the criteria for surgery
• Surgical removal of the parathyroid gland(s). Some
indications for surgery include patients under 50
and patients with a serum calcium > 3.00 mmol/L.

Common complications of parathyroid surgery
include:

•
•
•
•

• Hypocalcaemia
• Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
• Bleeding and haematoma formation.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism

A contraindication for parathyroid surgery is familial
hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism
Many diseases can cause hypocalcaemia (e.g. chronic
renal failure), which stimulates PTH as a compensatory response. If hypocalcaemia is prolonged the
glands enlarge by hyperplasia to secrete excess PTH.
This is called secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is
characterized by raised PTH with normal or low serum
calcium.

Causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism
Hypocalcaemia can be caused by:
• Chronic renal failure
• Vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption.
In chronic renal failure, the kidneys fail to reabsorb
calcium. Renal osteodystrophy is a complication of
chronic kidney disease characterized by:
• Secondary hyperparathyroidism
• Osteomalacia
• Vitamin D deficiency.

Dietary modification and/or phosphate binders
Vitamin D analogues
Modification of dialysis
Cinacalcet (calcimimetic). This is not recommended
for patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a complication of secondary hyperparathyroidism and is seen in patients
with renal failure. If secondary hyperparathyroidism
persists, the level of calcium required to inhibit PTH
production by the parathyroid glands is reset to a higher
level. This causes autonomous parathyroid gland activity and hypercalcaemia. Parathyroidectomy is often indicated at this stage.

Familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcaemia
This is a rare genetic condition which is characterized
by raised renal reabsorption of calcium in the presence
of hypercalcaemia. It is caused by a mutation of the
calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid glands,
resulting in deficient binding, and this raises the setpoint for calcium homeostasis. Diagnosis depends
on family history and a reduced calcium/creatinine
clearance ratio in blood and urine samples. No treatment is indicated and parathyroid surgery does not
solve the problem.

It is caused by:
• Impaired 1a-hydroxylase activity in the kidney. This
leads to reduced vitamin D activation and less calcium reabsorption. This increases PTH production.
• Impaired phosphate clearance by the kidney. Hyperphosphataemia reduces the amount of ionized calcium, leading to increased PTH production.
• PTH-induced reabsorption of calcium from bone,
leading to bone marrow fibrosis and cyst formation.
This can be identified radiologically and is called osteitis fibrosa cystica.
Vitamin D deficiency can occur if the diet is deficient in
vitamin D or the skin does not receive adequate sunlight
(e.g. people who spend excessive amounts of time indoors or extensive skin covering) of the right wavelength to produce vitamin D (UVB). Deficiency of
activated vitamin D causes hypocalcaemia as a result
of impaired calcium absorption in the intestines. Reduced intestinal absorption and reduced mobility occur
in the elderly as a normal process, so they are at a higher
risk of developing vitamin D deficiency. Clinically there
is a normal amount of bone but it does not mineralize
fully – osteomalacia in adults, rickets in children.
Treatment aims to correct the cause. This may
include:

Hypoparathyroidism
Hypoparathyroidism is the deficiency of PTH resulting
in hypocalcaemia. It causes the usual symptoms of
hypocalcaemia (see Fig. 8.12) but without osteomalacia. The main causes are listed below:
• Complication of thyroid or parathyroid surgery
• Congenital deficiency – DiGeorge syndrome
• Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism – an autoimmune
disorder
• Pseudohypoparathyroidism – congenital PTH
resistance.
Investigations reveal reduced serum calcium and
increased serum phosphate.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism is the result of resistance
to PTH. Patients have raised PTH with the symptoms of
hypoparathyroidism.
Hypocalcaemia may cause carpopedal spasm,
which can be elicited by occluding the brachial artery
with a blood-pressure cuff for over 3 minutes (Trousseau’s sign). Hypocalcaemia can also be demonstrated
clinically by the twitching of the ipsilateral facial
muscles in response to tapping on the facial nerve
(Chvostek’s sign). If hypocalcaemia is suspected on

Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone
mass and deterioration of bone sufficient to cause bone
fragility and an increased risk of fracture. It is defined as
a bone mineral density (BMD) 2.5 standard deviations
(or less) below the mean BMD for young, healthy adults
at peak bone mass. Osteopenia is defined as 1–2.5 standard deviations below normal BMD.
It is caused by increased osteoclast activity and breakdown of bone and decreased bone formation by

92

* * *
* *
* * *

osteoblasts. This causes loss of bone mass; however, adequate bone mineralization still occurs.
Since new bone is poorly formed, microfractures
cannot be repaired, so the bones become thin and
brittle.
Loss of bone is a normal part of the ageing process;
however, women are at a greater risk due to the loss
of oestrogen production after menopause. There
are a number of other risk factors for osteoporosis
including:
•
•
•
•
•

Family history of osteoporotic fractures
Rheumatoid arthritis
Long-term corticosteroid use
Alcohol intake of > 4 units per day and smoking
Vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in
the elderly.

Osteroporosis is responsible for approximately
180 000 fractures in England and Wales every year.

Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
• Describe the roles, actions and regulation of growth hormone and IGFs
• Name other factors affecting growth
• Name four peptide growth factors, the tissues that secrete them, and where they affect
• Understand how to determine height and mean parental height
• Understand the principal diagnosis and management of growth disorders
• Describe the main changes that occur in the body during puberty.

Growth hormone (GH) is a pituitary hormone that can
act directly on tissues throughout the body; however, its
main effects are mediated by insulin-like growth factors
(IGFs). These are secreted from the liver in response to
GH. In this way, growth follows the conventional pattern
of starting in the hypothalamus (described in Chapter 2).
Growth is a process that takes place at many levels.
It can be defined as an increase in:
•
•
•
•
•

Anabolism (e.g. protein synthesis)
Cell size and number
Cell mutation and maintenance
Organ size
Body size or weight.

Acting through IGFs, GH stimulates all the processes
listed above. By promoting anabolic processes, the cell
increases in size. This promotes cell division and maturation, causing the organ to grow. The cellular actions of
GH begin at birth and continue throughout life, though
the level of action varies. The fastest rate of growth is in
the fetus and neonate; however, a growth spurt also
occurs during puberty.
The growth of the body is limited by the epiphyses
(growth plates) at the ends of the long bones. GH stimulates these plates to grow, causing bones to lengthen
and body height to increase. It also stimulates fusion of
these growth plates preventing further growth.

Important words:
Anabolism: the process of building large molecules
from smaller ones
Epiphysis: the end of a long bone (plural epiphyses)
Epiphyseal growth plate: an area of cartilage between
the epiphysis and shaft of the bone that proliferates
during childhood, resulting in elongation of the bone

Growth factor: any chemical that stimulates cellular
growth
Cell maturation: when a cell differentiates to reach its
final form

DIRECT CONTROL OF GROWTH

Growth hormone (GH)
GH (also called somatotrophin) is a polypeptide that is
secreted by the somatotroph cells in the anterior pituitary
gland. Like many pituitary hormones, it is synthesized
as a precursor molecule (pre-progrowth hormone).
Two cleavages release the active hormone. For more
information about the anterior pituitary, see Chapter 2.

Regulation of secretion
GH secretion is regulated by two hypothalamus releasing factors:
• Growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)
• Somatostatin (also called growth-hormone inhibiting
hormone or GHIH).
GHRH is released in a pulsatile manner, especially during deep sleep or hypoglycaemia, and GH release follows this pattern. Secretion of GH from the anterior
pituitary gland is also regulated by the negative feedback
of IGF-1 and other growth factors (Fig. 9.1).

Effects
GH promotes the growth and maintenance of most
cells. It exerts most of its effects by:
• Stimulating the uptake of amino acids
• Stimulating the synthesis of proteins.

GH exerts most of its effects via IGFs. GH promotes
their synthesis, mainly in the liver but also in other
tissues.
GH is transported in the blood bound to GHbinding protein. It acts via G-protein and Janus kinase
(JAK) receptors on the cell surface of the target cells.

Insulin-like growth factors
Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs or somatomedins) are
polypeptide hormones that exist in two forms: IGF-1
and IGF-2. They resemble insulin in structure and they
act via similar receptors. IGF-1 is more important as a
stimulator of growth. It is transported in the blood by
a number of IGF-binding proteins.

Growth actions
The increase in protein synthesis caused by the metabolic effects of IGF hormones causes cells to grow. This
stimulates cell division and maturation, causing organs
and soft tissues to enlarge.
The growth of the long bones depends on the
state of the epiphyseal growth plate. This is a layer of
chondrocytes (cartilage cells) located between the
end (epiphysis) and shaft (diaphysis) of the bone
(Fig. 9.2). Before puberty, IGFs stimulate these chondrocytes to grow, divide and mature into osteocytes
(bone cells), allowing the bone to lengthen whilst
maintaining a population of chondrocytes in the plate
for further growth. During puberty, IGFs and sex steroids stimulate the chondrocytes within the plate to
mature into osteocytes so that the epiphysis and diaphysis become fused together. The bone is no longer able
to lengthen with further IGF stimulation so final adult
height is reached.

Other growth factors
Growth in specific tissues is also stimulated by a number
of growth factors, many of which are small peptides that
act in a paracrine (local) manner. Their relationship to
GH is not known. The actions and secretion of several
such peptides are described in Fig. 9.3.

INDIRECT CONTROL OF
HORMONES

Metabolic actions

Many factors apart from GH control growth,
including:

Both IGF hormones have some insulin-like actions, e.g.
increasing amino acid uptake and protein synthesis.
However, they also oppose the actions of insulin on glucose by preventing glucose uptake and causing glycogen
breakdown to raise blood glucose.

• Genetics – tall parents often have tall children
• Adequate nutrition – however, excess nutrition does
not increase height
• Health – chronic disease affects height
• Other hormones.

Other hormones

Fetal growth

Growth problems can be caused by the abnormal secretion of a number of hormones, including:

In the fetus, a hormone called placental lactogen is secreted from the placenta. It stimulates fetal cartilage development and acts in a similar manner to prolactin on
the maternal mammary glands.
Thyroid hormones are essential for the development
of the skeleton and CNS. A deficiency in the fetus or neonate results in cretinism.

Thyroid hormones

Puberty

Thyroid hormones, described in Chapter 3, stimulate
cell metabolism, promoting cell growth and division,
especially in the skeleton and developing central nervous system (CNS). Thyroid hormones also stimulate
GH secretion from the pituitary.
Cortisol is described in Chapter 4; it inhibits pituitary
GH secretion, so chronic ill health or stress can suppress
growth.
Normal growth can only occur if both the hormone
milieu and the nutritional supply of proteins are
suitable.

Sexual maturation and the pubertal growth spurt are described later in this chapter.

DETERMINATION OF HEIGHT
A person’s final height is determined simply by the rate
and duration of growth.
During puberty, the epiphyseal growing plates at the
end of the long bones begin to fuse. This fusion prevents further growth and, therefore, further height gain.

97

Endocrine control of growth
Complete fusion occurs between 18 and 20 years of age
in males, and earlier in females.
Fusion of the epiphyseal plates is stimulated primarily by GH and sex steroids; however, thyroid hormone
also promotes this effect. A simple increase in GH during puberty is not sufficient to increase final height since
bones simply mature faster and stop growing.
Only the bones that grow in this manner are prevented from responding to further GH. The jaw and
skull can continue to grow past puberty; this effect is
seen in GH excess. Ultimately, height is determined
by multiple genetic factors.
Short stature, defined as a height less than the third
centile, is associated with poor academic achievement
and anxiety. Growth rates less than the 25th centile
will result in a child dropping down centiles on a
growth chart. Short stature can be primary, secondary
or idiopathic. Primary disorders reflect an intrinsic
bone defect and include achondroplasia and some
causes of intrauterine growth retardation. Secondary
disorders occur in the presence of other factors that
limit bone growth. Malnutrition, chronic disease and
endocrine disorders, such as Cushing’s, can also be
secondary causes. Idiopathic short stature is the most
common cause of short stature and is a variant of
normal.

DISORDERS OF GROWTH

Excess of growth hormone
Excess GH prior to epiphyseal fusion causes gigantism,
proportional abnormal growth. Since the epiphyses
also fuse at an earlier age, the child may have an unremarkable height in adulthood. Diabetes is very common in this group because of the opposing actions of
insulin and GH on blood glucose.
An excess of GH is slightly more common in adults,
where it manifests as acromegaly (prevalence approximately 60 per million). The signs and symptoms are
shown in Fig. 9.4. The long bones can no longer
lengthen, so there is no increase in height. However,
the soft tissues and other bones can still grow, causing
the distinctive features of this condition (Fig. 9.5). Acromegaly is a serious condition, associated with an increase
in mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and malignancy. A therapeutic reduction in plasma
GH is effective in reducing this excess mortality.
GH-secretion pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of acromegaly. These adenomas can cause
other symptoms by compressing surrounding structures (e.g. pituitary stalk compression). Assessment

98

of acromegaly should therefore include demonstration
of excess GH, localization of the tumour, global assessment of anterior pituitary function and assessment of
metabolic and structural complications.

Diagnosis
Excess GH can be diagnosed by high IGF-1 levels, but
the best test is to measure GH levels following an oral
glucose tolerance test. GH levels should fall with the
rise in glucose. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used
to confirm the presence of a functional pituitary
adenoma.

Treatment
The mainstay of treatment is surgical removal of the
tumour. At 3 months post-op, a day curve of GH levels
is measured (4–5 samples, aiming for a mean GH
>5 mU/L) or a repeat oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), measure IGF-1, and do pituitary function tests
to rule out hypopituitarism.
Additional treatments may be needed if surgery
is unsuccessful. These include somatostatin/GHIH
analogues, recombinant GH analogue (acts as a GH
receptor antagonist) and radiotherapy.

Deficiency of growth hormone
The deficiency of GH in children is called dwarfism. It is
detected by short stature along with either:
• Dropping between growth chart centiles (i.e. not following the expected course)
• Being significantly shorter than mean parental
height (MPH).
The most common cause of dwarfism is a deficiency
of GHRH from the hypothalamus; craniopharyngiomas
can also be responsible. See Chapter 2 for more details.

Diagnosis and treatment
GH deficiency is diagnosed using a stimulation test.
Impaired GH rise is seen after sleep, hypoglycaemia induced by IV insulin (used less often because of risks) or
an arginine stimulation test. The treatment for GH deficiency is subcutaneous injections of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) before sleep each night.
Genetic short stature
Children can be short as a consequence of genetics
without pathological correlates. These children have
short parents and they start growing below the 5th
centile but at a normal rate with a normal age
of pubertal onset. Mean parental height (MPH) is the
average of the parents’ heights plus 7 cm in males or

PUBERTY
Puberty is when the sexually immature child becomes a
sexually fertile adult. Prepuberty girls and boys develop
pubic and axillary hair. This prepubertal phase is the result of adrenache (Chapter 3). Puberty starts with the
reactivation of gonadotrophin (LH and FSH) release

after the dormancy of childhood. The age of pubertal
onset varies widely between individuals (females 8–
13 years; males 9–14 years). Puberty is characterized by
a number of processes:
•
•
•
•

Pubertal growth spurt
Development of secondary sexual characteristics
Achievement of fertility
Psychological and social development.

Gonadarche and the initiation
of puberty
From an endocrine perspective, puberty is marked
by the onset of pulsatile gonadotrophin release
from the anterior pituitary gland during the night.

99

Endocrine control of growth
Fig. 9.5 X-ray of the skull showing
acromegaly

Gonadotrophins stimulate the production of sex steroids (i.e. testosterone and oestrogen) from the gonads;
the activation of the gonads is gonadarche.
The onset of puberty is not fully understood; however, the CNS integrates a number of signals. According
to the gonadostat hypothesis, a reduction in hypothalamic sensitivity to the negative feedback of the sex
steroids causes the hypothalamus to secrete higher
levels of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
in a pulsatile manner. Secretion of growth hormone
(GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is also increased.
Other evidence favours the central maturation of the
CNS and its common final communication pathways
between the hypothalamus GnRH neurons and the
pituitary.

Body weight and puberty
In the last few decades the onset of puberty has occurred
at an increasingly young age. This change is often attributed to improved nutrition and rising body weight

100

of 47 kg is a better predictor of the start of periods
than age.
In recent years, a possible mechanism for this effect
has been found. The hormone leptin is secreted by the
adipose tissue, and is a hormonal indicator of body fat:
higher levels of leptin are present with increasing body
fat. Leptin may be the trigger for GnRH activation. Puberty cannot begin without leptin, but evidence suggests
that it is only one of a number of factors. The exact details of the causal relationship between a critical metabolic mass derived from lean body weight, body fat
and total body water and the onset of puberty remains
unclear.

The pubertal growth spurt
The earliest developmental event in puberty is an increase in growth velocity called the growth spurt. It occurs about 2 years earlier in females, giving a temporary
height advantage. The initial rise in growth velocity is
slight, so growth of the breasts or testes is usually noticed first.

Puberty
The increase in growth is caused by increased GH and
sex steroid secretion. Sex steroids also cause bone maturation. As the bones mature, the growing plates
(epiphyses) fuse, preventing further growth. This fusion
occurs 2 years earlier in females, giving males an extra
2 years of growth. This largely accounts for the increased
height of adult males.

Puberty in the male
Puberty usually occurs between 9 and 14 years of age
in boys; however, it is considered normal if it occurs
between 9 and 16 years of age. Once the testes have
developed, male pubertal changes are brought about
by the secretion of androgens such as DHT and
testosterone.

Testes development and early puberty
Growth of the testes from <2 mL to >4 mL is often the
first sign of puberty noticed in boys around 12 years.
The increase is mainly due to proliferation of the seminiferous tubules under the influence of FSH. LH stimulates the interstitial Leydig cells to secrete testosterone.
The scrotum becomes larger, thicker and pigmented;
pubic hair growth follows.
Spermatogenesis begins once the testes have enlarged and matured and is associated with a rise in serum inhibin B. Nocturnal emissions and daytime
ejaculations are often around 13–14 years of age at stage
3 of Tanner’s male genital staging, with fertile ejaculations around 15 years.
HINTS AND TIPS
Clinically, male puberty has begun when the
testes reach 4 mL. This is measured with an
orchidometer.

Penile development and late puberty
The penis begins to enlarge after the testes about the
same time the growth spurt is noticed. The penis doubles in size during puberty to reach an average size of
9.5 cm flaccid or 13.2 cm erect.
Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY) is associated with small
testicles, abnormal spermatogenesis and infertility. The
syndrome is also associated with delayed motor
learning. Treatment is with testosterone. Women with
Turner’s syndrome lack part of the X chromosome (or a
whole X chromosome) needed for normal ovarian

9

development and acquisition of normal secondary
sexual characteristics. These women are often
amenorrhoeic, infertile and have abnormal breast and
pubic hair development. Treatment is with oestrogen
to promote sexual development and growth hormone
to encourage growth.

Facial and axillary hair growth usually starts at about
15 years of age. The sebaceous glands in the skin are also
activated, often causing acne.
The breaking of the voice is also a late feature. The
larynx, cricothyroid cartilage and laryngeal muscles enlarge to give an Adam’s apple.

HINTS AND TIPS
Tanner’s staging is used to assess puberty milestones
and compare individuals. The stages are based on testis,
scrotum and penile growth and pubic hair in males:
Stage 1: height increases 5 cm per year, no pigmented
pubic hair, testes volume < 4 mL, no penis growth.
Stage 2: height increases 5 cm per year, small amount
of pigmented pubic hair, testes volume 4–6 mL,
increased penis dimensions. Stage 3: height increases
7.5 cm per year, darker pubic hair, testes volume
8–10 mL, increased penis dimensions. Stage 4: height
increases 10 cm per year, testes volume 14–16 mL,
increased penis dimensions, adult pubic hair quality.
Stage 5: adult pubic hair distribution, testes volume
18–25 mL, maximum height reached, mature penis
size reached.
Additional changes: axillary hair, increased muscle
mass, voice breaks.

Puberty in the female
Puberty in females usually occurs between 8 and
13 years of age in girls; however, it is considered normal
between 8 and 15 years of age. The changes caused by
oestrogens and progesterone are shown in Fig. 9.6.

Breast development and early puberty
The development of breast buds is often the first sign of
puberty noticed in girls. The breast then continues to
grow under the influence of oestrogen while the ductal
system develops; the number of lobules remains the
same from infancy (Fig. 9.6). Pubic hair begins to grow
about 6 months later.

Menarche and late puberty
The uterus begins to enlarge after the development of
pubic hair. The onset of menstruation (periods) is called
menarche. The mean age of menarche is 13 years, making it a late feature of puberty. In the ovary, follicular
development begins and the first ovulation occurs
10 months after the first menarche, on average, i.e.
the early menstrual cycle are often anovulatory and
infertile.
Tanner’s stages and the female
In the female, the stages are based on breast and pubic
hair development.

102

Breast development
Stage 1: preadolescent, only papillae are elevated. Stage
2: breast bud develops with papillae and breasts
elevated. Stage 3: juvenile smooth stage with further
growth of breasts and areolae. Stage 4: areolae and
papillae project above the breasts. Stage 5: adult pattern
with areolae on the same level as the rest of the breasts.
Pubic hair development
Stage 1: preadolescent, no pubic hair. Stage 2: sparse
hair on labia majora. Stage 3: darker, coarser and curlier
hair, spreads over pubis. Stage 4: adult-type pattern
but covers smaller area. Stage 5: adult pattern.

the end of this chapter you should be able to:
Describe the theories of MEN tumour formation
List the common tumours associated with each of the MEN syndromes
Describe the theories behind ectopic hormone secretion
List tumours that secrete hormones ectopically, along with the relevant tumour
Understand carcinoid tumours and carcinoid syndrome.

Endocrine organs can undergo neoplastic change and
non-endocrine organs can acquire an endocrine phenotype as a result of neoplastic change. When several different endocrine tumour types affect a single individual
they are usually part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia
(MEN) syndrome. These syndromes result when several
endocrine disorders, share a common genetic basis.
There are three patterns, referred to as MEN-I, MEN-IIa
and MEN-IIb. These syndromes are rare, but they can
cause tumours in young adults. They are usually inherited and genetic testing can be used to determine the risk
in family members.
Other endocrine syndromes are caused when tissues
outside the endocrine system give rise to ‘ectopic’ hormone-secreting tumours. These tumours can present
with symptoms pertinent to the hormone that is being
secreted.

MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE
NEOPLASIA SYNDROMES
MEN syndromes are clusters of endocrine tumours that
often occur in the same patient. The tumours are rare,
usually aggressive and arise in multiple tissues; they occur earlier than single sporadic tumours. The underlying
cause is probably genetic, since these syndromes are
usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion although some cases are sporadic.
MEN syndromes are rare, but they may be lifethreatening.

The following patterns of MEN have been described:
MEN-I, MEN-IIa, MEN-IIb (Fig. 10.1) and FMTC.

MEN-I (Werner’s syndrome)
The most common tumours are:
• Parathyroid hyperplasia – most common
• Pancreatic islet cell tumours/duodenal tumours
• Pituitary adenoma (secrete growth hormone, prolactin or ACTH).
The pancreatic islet cell tumours may secrete ectopic
hormones (e.g. glucagonoma or insulinoma) and
the duodenal tumours may secrete gastrin causing
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Thirty per cent of the very
rare Zollinger–Ellison tumours are caused by MEN-I.
MEN-1 is caused by loss-of-function of a tumour
suppressor gene, the MEN-I gene, which produces a
protein that regulates cell proliferation. Patients
typically have a germline mutation in one allele and
acquire somatic mutations in the other allele. MEN-II
syndromes are caused by gain-of-function mutations in
the RET proto-oncogene. The precise genetic location
of this mutation determines the exact phenotype. If
family members test positive for these mutations, they
can be treated with prophylactic surgery.

Less commonly, MEN-I is associated with:
• Parathyroid adenoma
• Hyperplasia of thyroid parafollicular cells
• Adrenal cortical hyperplasia.

MEN-IIa (Sipple’s syndrome)
The main tumours of the MEN-II syndrome are:
• Phaeochromocytoma (often bilateral)
• Medullary cell carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC, often
multi-focal, age of onset < 30).
Occasionally, parathyroid hyperplasia can develop.

Treatment

The very rare MEN-IIb is sometimes called MEN-III.
MEN-IIb patients get both phaeochromocytomas and
MTC, although the MTC is usually more aggressive
and is present before 5 years of age. Patients also have
a marfanoid appearance (long axial bones). Two other
types of tumour develop in the skin and submucosa
throughout the body:

The tumours are treated in a similar manner to any
symptomatic tumour, i.e.:

• Neuromas (tumours of neurons)
• Ganglioneuromas (tumours of neuronal ganglia).

The exact mechanism behind ectopic hormone release is
not fully understood, and it may vary between tumours.
There are two main theories:

Familial medullary thyroid
carcinoma (FMTC)
Medullary thyroid cancer can also occur in a hereditary
pattern without the other endocrine abnormalities.
Seventy-five per cent of MTC is not familial. Calcitonin
is a good plasma marker for following the progression
of MTC.

• Surgical removal
• Irradiation
• Chemotherapy.

Aetiology of ectopic hormones

• The tumour originates from cells that normally secrete small amounts of hormones, e.g. cells of the
bronchial mucosa normally secrete adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and anaplastic carcinoma
of the lung secretes ectopic ACTH.
• Mutations associated with the transformation to
neoplasia activate dormant genes, resulting in ectopic hormone production.

Types of ectopic hormone

ECTOPIC HORMONE SYNDROMES

Ectopic hormones
‘Ectopic’ means out of place. The term ‘ectopic hormone’ is used when a tissue secretes a hormone that
it does not normally secrete. The hormone is released
in an uncontrolled manner by a tumour (benign or
malignant). The tumour can be:
• Endocrine tissue secreting unusual hormones
• Non-endocrine tissue secreting any hormone.
Symptoms are usually caused by the excess of the ectopic hormone while the tumour is still small. Examples
of syndromes caused by ectopic hormone secretion are
listed in Fig. 10.2.

104

Ectopic hormones are almost always peptide hormones
because their synthesis requires expression of only a single gene. Steroid hormone synthesis requires the expression of a complicated series of enzymes.
The ectopic hormone is often not an exact version of
a normal hormone, e.g. breast cancer cells secrete PTHrelated peptide. This would fit the second theory of
aetiology, since the normal processing enzymes may
not be present.

CARCINOID TUMOURS
These are tumours of the APUD cells of the small intestine, most commonly affecting the appendix, terminal
ileum and rectum. They can also occur in other locations in the GI tract, bronchus and the sexual organs.

Carcinoid tumours are normally asymptomatic until
metastases occur, though the tumour may cause some
symptoms as it grows. Some tumours in the appendix
can cause appendicitis as they cause obstruction.
These tumours can also secrete a variety of hormones, including insulin, glucagon, ACTH (can cause
Cushing’s syndrome), thyroid and parathyroid hormones. Other secretions include serotonin, tachykinins,
bradykinins, gastrin and prostaglandins. These tumours
can appear with other neuroendocrine tumours or as
part of MEN-I syndrome.

and neck (most likely a result of bradykinins), as well
as recurrent periods of diarrhoea and abdominal pain.
Patients can also develop cardiac complications due
to serotonin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and tricuspid
incompetence.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis involves looking for the secondary signs of
the tumour itself, specifically ultrasound for liver
metastases and 24-hour urine collection to measure
the main metabolite of serotonin. This is called
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.

CARCINOID SYNDROME
This occurs in around 5% of patients with carcinoid tumours and indicates liver involvement. Typically patients will complain of flushing, especially in the face

Treatment
The mainstay of treatment is surgery to remove the
tumour.

Hormones of the
reproductive system

11

Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should:
• Know the relevant anatomy of both male and female genitalia
• Understand the hormones secreted by the different organs and their function
• Understand the hormonal changes in the body associated with pregnancy, labour and lactation.

The reproductive systems in both men and women are
controlled in many ways by the endocrine system, as seen
in puberty. The reproductive organs themselves produce
hormones that can influence the rest of the body. This
chapter focuses on the normal functions of these organs
and the actions of the hormones they release.
The main functions of the female reproductive system are:
• Oogenesis and ovulation – production and release
of oocytes (female gametes)
• Fertilization – allowing the sperm and oocyte to
meet and fuse
• Pregnancy – providing a suitable environment for
the fetus to grow
• Parturition – expelling the fetus with minimal
trauma to the baby and mother
• Lactation – providing nutrition for the baby.
After menarche (the start of periods), the female body
prepares for pregnancy every month until menopause.
This process is regulated by four main hormones
(Fig. 11.1):
•
•
•
•

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
Luteinizing hormone (LH)
Oestrogen
Progesterone.

Further details on development and disorders of the reproductive systems are covered in other textbooks
(Crash Course Renal and Urinary Systems and Crash Course
Obstetrics and Gynaecology). Polycystic ovary syndrome is
a disease of the female reproductive system and is
covered in this chapter.

THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE
SYSTEM

Anatomy
The female reproductive system consists of six main
components (Fig. 11.3):
• Ovaries – produce oocytes and female sex steroids
(e.g. oestrogens)
• Uterine (fallopian) tubes – connect the ovaries to the
uterus; they are the normal site of fertilization
• Uterus – supports the implantation and development of the fetus
• Vagina – normal site for the deposition of sperm
• Vulva – the structures surrounding the introitus (external orifice of the vagina)
• Breasts – produce milk.

The male reproductive system consists of the testes,
prostate, seminal vesicles and the penis. Its principal
functions are:

The blood supply, lymphatics and innervation of the female reproductive organs are shown in Fig. 11.4.

• Sperm production (spermatogenesis) and release
• Production of hormones involved in male reproduction and libido.

Hormones

After puberty, the testes begin to produce sperm and
they continue to do so until death. This process is regulated by four main hormones (Fig. 11.2):
•
•
•
•

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
Luteinizing hormone (LH)
Testosterone
Inhibin B.

Ovarian sex steroids
The ovaries produce a number of steroid hormones in
response to gonadotrophins from the anterior pituitary.
The main hormones produced are:
• Oestrogens, e.g. oestradiol
• Progestogens, e.g. progesterone
• Androgens, e.g. androstenedione.

Oestrogens
Oestrogens are secreted at the start of the menstrual cycle in response to LH and FSH. Their synthesis takes
place in the developing ovarian follicle (Fig. 11.5), requiring both the thecal and granulosa cells. The theca
interna secretes androgens in response to LH. LH activates the enzyme that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone (i.e. the first step in steroid production); however,
the thecal cells lack the aromatase enzyme necessary to
convert androgens to oestrogens.
The majority of androgens cross the basement membrane into the granulosa cells. FSH activates the aromatase enzyme produced by granulosa cells, allowing the
thecal androgens to be converted to oestrogens (mainly
oestradiol-17b). The process of oestrogen synthesis is
shown in Fig. 11.6. After ovulation, oestrogens are produced by the corpus luteum formed from the follicle.
Oestrogens are transported in the blood bound to sexhormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. They
act via intracellular receptors in the target cells. Oestrogens
act on the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus to provide
feedback which regulates the system. This feedback is usually negative, but high concentrations of oestrogens for
prolonged periods result in a switch to the positive feedback required to induce the LH surge. The actions of oestrogens are shown in Figure 11.7. The main actions are:
• Development of the reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics

• Proliferation of the functional layer of uterus
endometrium
• Production of watery cervical mucus to allow sperm
penetration
• Production of glycogen by the vaginal epithelium.

Progestogens
Progestogens are secreted in the second half of the
menstrual cycle by the corpus luteum. This structure
is formed by the transformation of the granulosa
and theca interna cells in the follicle after ovulation;
LH maintains the secretory activity of these cells.
The main progestogen is progesterone, which is synthesized from cholesterol in just two steps. During
pregnancy, progesterone production is taken over by
the placenta.
Progesterone is transported in the blood bound to
corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin.
It acts via intracellular receptors in the target cells.
Progesterone acts on the anterior pituitary and the
hypothalamus to provide negative feedback. The actions of progesterone are shown in Figure 11.7. Its main
actions are:
• Maintenance of the uterine endometrium
• Stimulation of uterine secretions
• Production of viscid cervical mucus to form an impenetrable barrier.

and FSH stimulate enzymes involved in oestrogen synthesis. LH also allows the formation and maintenance
of the corpus luteum that synthesizes progestogens
and oestrogens.
Oestrogens and progestogens feed back to the anterior hypothalamus to regulate their release. This feedback is usually inhibitory and it prevents excess
secretion. Before ovulation, the oestrogen feedback becomes positive, triggering the surge in LH release that
causes ovulation.

Androgens
The androgens are precursors of oestrogens; however,
small quantities are released systemically. They act with
adrenal androgen to promote pubic and axillary hair
growth during puberty.

Control of ovarian steroid
production
Ovarian steroids are regulated in a similar manner to
many other major hormones (as shown in Fig. 11.2). Gonadotrophin-releasing factor (GnRH) is synthesized by
the hypothalamus and transported to the anterior pituitary gland in the portal veins. Here, it acts on gonadotroph cells to stimulate the release of gonadotrophins
(i.e. LH and FSH). This process is described in more
detail in Chapter 2.
Gonadotrophins reach the ovaries in the blood and
stimulate the release of the ovarian sex steroids. Both LH

110

The menstrual cycle is the process by which the female
prepares for possible fertilization of the secondary oocyte. The system is driven by feedback loops between
hypothalamic GnRH pulses, pituitary LH and FSH release and ovarian oestrogen, progesterone, inhibin
and activin release. Unless interrupted by pregnancy
or pathology, these feedback loops generate a cycle that
lasts 28–32 days and begins on the first day of menstruation (also called a ‘period’). A number of changes occur
in the ovaries and endometrium; these are regulated by
hormones. The hormonal, ovarian and endometrial
changes are shown in Fig. 11.8.
The cycle is divided into two stages, each lasting
about 14 days. Between these stages (about the 14th
day) ovulation occurs.

Regulation of the cycle by the
hypothalamic–pituitary axis
GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus intrinsically generate pulsatile GnRH release. FSH and LH act through endogenous opioids in the hypothalamus to modulate
GnRH pulse frequency and amplitude. In turn, the amplitude and frequency of GnRH release dictates the pattern of LH and FSH transcription and release from the
pituitary. LH then promotes androstenedione production in the theca cells and FSH stimulates oestrogen production in the granulosa cells and follicular growth.

The first half of the cycle
The first half of the cycle begins on the first day of menstruation and lasts until ovulation. The length of the first
half of the cycle is variable; if a woman has a long cycle it
is the first stage that is prolonged.

Ovarian changes
This stage of the cycle is called the follicular stage in the
ovary.

During menstruation, LH and FSH levels rise as oestrogen and progesterone production subside. As its
name implies, FSH stimulates several antral (secondary)
follicles to mature. Cell cooperation between the granulosa cells and the thecal cells allows oestrogen production to begin and for the next 12 days oestrogen levels
rise exponentially. Most of the oestrogen output is from
the dominant follicle.
The oestrogens stimulate synthesis of LH receptors in
the granulosa cells and growth accelerates. With the LH
surge, usually only one follicle will be released (the
dominant follicle). The other follicles regress (a process
called atresia).
Oral contraceptives: administration of synthetic
oestrogen and/or progestogen through the first
half of the menstrual cycle prevents FSH secretion. This
prevents follicular growth so that ovulation cannot
occur.
The dominant follicle has a diameter of about 2.5 cm
just before ovulation. The development of the follicle is

shown in Fig. 11.5. It is composed of seven layers. From
the inside out these are as follows:
• Primary oocyte – the female gamete, arrested in first
meiotic prophase
• Zona pellucida – a glycoprotein layer that surrounds
the oocyte like an egg shell
• Granulosa cells – cuboidal cells surrounding the oocyte; they secrete oestrogens
• Antrum – fluid-filled cavity within the granulosa cells
• Basement membrane/lamina
• Theca interna – a layer of stromal cells that secrete
androgens
• Theca externa – a non-secretory stromal cell layer.

Endometrial changes
The first half of the cycle is separated into two phases:
• Menstrual phase
• Proliferative phase.

During the menstrual phase (days 1–4) the ischaemic
and necrotic functional layer of the endometrium is
lost. This sloughed tissue passes out of the vagina, along
with blood from the degenerating spiral arteries.
The proliferative phase (days 4–13) is caused by the
rising oestrogen levels. These stimulate cells in the basal
layer of the endometrium to proliferate and form a new
functional layer. Glands are formed in this layer but
they are not yet active.
The rising oestrogen also stimulates secretion of a
watery cervical mucus that facilitates sperm transport
across the cervix. At other times, the mucus is scant
and thick.

Ovulation
At the end of the follicular stage, the dominant antral
follicle secretes such large quantities of oestrogen that
the feedback to the pituitary gland changes. The feedback

112

turns from negative to positive and the very high oestrogen levels cause a dramatic surge in the release of LH and,
to a lesser extent, FSH. LH causes the follicle to complete
the first meiotic division and rupture through the germinal epithelium – a process called ovulation. The secondary oocyte and its first polar body are released into
the peritoneal cavity; they are surrounded by the zona
pellucida and a few granulosa cells. The released oocyte
is swept into the uterine tubes by the wafting action of
the cilia of the fimbriae.

The second half of the cycle
The second half of the cycle is the time between ovulation and menstruation; the average length is 14 days
and this remains constant despite changes in cycle
length. The length is determined by the lifespan of the
corpus luteum (about 10 days). This stage of the cycle
is called the luteal stage in the ovary.

Hormones of the reproductive system

Ovarian changes

Other ovarian hormones

The LH surge continues to act on the granulosa and
theca cells in the empty follicle once ovulation has occurred. The cells change and become yellow. They are
now called lutein cells (lutein means yellow, hence
the name ‘luteinizing’ hormone) and the rump of the
ruptured follicle is called the corpus luteum.
Over the next 10 days, these cells secrete high levels of
progesterone and oestrogens, but they then spontaneously
involute (shrink) and lose their secretory ability unless
they are rescued by the signal of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by the implanting conceptus.
The progesterone and oestrogen secreted by the corpus luteum inhibit LH and FSH release from the pituitary gland. The falling LH levels fail to maintain the
corpus luteum, so it undergoes involution. As a result,
progesterone and oestrogen levels fall dramatically so
their negative feedback to the pituitary gland is lost.
FSH and LH secretion rise, causing ovarian follicles to
grow, thus starting the next cycle.
Oral contraceptives: the use of oestrogen and/or progestogen in oral contraceptives aims to mimic the early
stages of the second half of the menstrual cycle.

Inhibin and activin

Endometrial changes
After ovulation, the progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum activates the endometrium by stimulating
differentiation. A number of changes occur:
• Nutrients are stored in the cells
• Glands become tortuous (irregularly shaped) in
preparation for secretion.
About 5 days after ovulation, the glands begin to secrete
a glycogen-rich ‘milk’ in preparation for a potential embryo; as a result the changes to the endometrium during
the second half of the menstrual cycle are called the
secretory phase.
As progesterone and oestrogen levels fall, the spiral
arteries supplying the functional endometrium begin
to coil and constrict, causing ischaemia and necrosis.
Blood leaks from the damaged vessels into the endometrium before the whole functional endometrium is
shed. Menstruation occurs, and this marks the first
day of the next cycle.
If pregnancy occurs then the implanting conceptus
produces hCG, which binds to LH receptors on the luteal cells exerting a luteotrophic signal for the corpus
luteum to maintain itself.

The role of peptides in the menstrual cycle
FSH controls the production of inhibin and activin in
the granulosa cells. Inhibin A suppresses FSH release
during the early follicular phase and inhibin B suppresses FSH during the late phase. Activin facilitates
the release of FSH and enhances its actions.

114

Inhibin and activin are polypeptide hormones secreted
by the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles. Inhibin inhibits pituitary FSH secretion, while activin stimulates
FSH secretion and inhibits androgen production but
stimulates conversion to oestrogens. Together, they regulate FSH secretion and local sex steroid levels and the
balance between oestrogens and androgens.

Relaxin
This is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the corpus
luteum and placenta. It prepares the body for childbirth
by causing cervical softening and relaxation of pelvic
ligaments.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS/
Stein–Leventhal syndrome)
This is a syndrome composed of hyperandrogenism,
oligo-ovulation and polycystic ovaries. The polycystic
ovaries must be in the absence of other conditions,
e.g. congenital adrenal hyperplasia (late onset) or Cushing’s syndrome, that can cause them. The exact cause of
PCOS is not known and while it is often familial, there
have been no genes yet linked to it.
Patients with this condition often have associated insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, and diabetes/
metabolic syndrome may appear as a complication later
in those patients who are obese.
Patients with this condition typically present with
irregular or infrequent periods or possibly with infertility. The patients may also have a number of other signs:
• Hirsutism (excessive growth of thick dark hair in
an androgen-dependent pattern) usually over the
upper lip
• Male-pattern baldness
• Acanthosis nigricans (darkened, thick velvety skin in
the body folds, usually the neck)
• Obesity
• Deep voice
• Acne.

Diagnosis
Raised LH:FSH ratio (approximately 3:1) with raised
testosterone and prolactin. Ultrasound scan will show
at least five small follicles, < 5 mm in diameter, along
the periphery of the ovaries.

Management
It is necessary to exclude other conditions first. Advice
on weight loss and exercise to improve periods and
insulin resistance must be given once diagnosis is

The male reproductive system
confirmed. Pharmacologically, metformin is recommended in women of BMI > 25 trying to conceive because of the improvement in insulin sensitivity,
ovulatory function and menstrual disturbance. Also
available is clomifene, which can stimulate ovulation
but increases risks of ovarian cancer. Additionally, the
use of ovarian drilling (diathermy creates holes in the
ovaries to reduce steroid production) is useful both as
a primary treatment of infertility or when clomifene
does not work. The combined oral contraceptive pill is
found to provide relief of irregular bleeding and can help
to reverse the increase in risk of endometrial cancer.

Complications
Patients with PCOS are seen to have increased risk of
both endometrial and ovarian cancer. Infertility and hypertension are also known associated problems.

THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE
SYSTEM
The male reproductive system consists of five main components (Fig. 11.9):
• Testes – produce the sperm
• Epididymis – stores and matures the sperm
• Vas (ductus) deferens – transports sperm from the
epididymis to the penis

11

• Prostate and seminal vesicles – secrete seminal fluid
to support ejaculated sperm
• Penis – deposits sperm in the vagina.
The blood supply, lymphatics and innervation of the
male reproductive organs are shown in Fig. 11.10.

Hormones
Testicular sex steroids
The testes secrete 95% of the male sex steroids called androgens; the adrenal cortex is responsible for the
remaining 5%. The main androgen is testosterone.
Testicular androgens are secreted by the interstitial
Leydig cells found between the seminiferous tubules.
They convert cholesterol into the steroid testosterone
by a series of reactions. The Leydig cells also secrete
small quantities of oestrogens and progestogens as byproducts of testosterone synthesis.
Testosterone is a strong androgen. However, some
target tissues can convert it to the more potent form
called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The conversion requires the 5-alpha reductase enzyme and occurs in the:
• Sertoli cells
• Prostate gland
• Skin.
Testosterone is transported in the plasma by sexhormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or albumin. It acts

Sources of reproductive hormones
Control of testicular steroid production
Testosterone synthesis and release is controlled by the
same hormones in the male as oestrogen synthesis in
the female. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
from the hypothalamus is transported to the anterior pituitary gland by the portal veins. It stimulates the gonadotroph cells to secrete gonadotrophins (LH and FSH).
This process is described in more detail in Chapter 2.
LH acts on the Leydig cells to stimulate the first step
in testosterone production. Testosterone feeds back to
the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to inhibit LH release, but it has little effect on FSH.
FSH acts on the Sertoli cells; it increases the number
of testosterone receptors to stimulate spermatogenesis.
It also causes inhibin B release from the Sertoli cells,
which feeds back to the hypothalamus and pituitary
gland to inhibit further FSH release. Inhibin has little effect on LH and therefore regulates sperm production
without inhibiting testosterone levels.

Other testicular hormones
The fetal Sertoli cells produce the Müllerian inhibiting
substance. This hormone prevents development of the
female internal genitalia by causing the Müllerian ducts
to regress.

Gynaecomastia
The male breast contains the same tissue components as
the female breast in the undeveloped, prepubescent
state. If the male breast enlarges, the condition is known
as gynaecomastia. It can be defined as the presence of
> 2 cm of palpable, firm, subareolar gland and ductal
breast tissue.
It is caused by any condition or process that raises
oestrogen or lowers testosterone levels. It can often occur in puberty, but will usually resolve with time. The
underlying cause should be treated if it fails to resolve.
Common causes include:

• TFTs
• CXR, to look for tumours.
The next line of investigation would be to check LH,
FSH, oestrogen and testosterone levels. If these tests indicate any abnormalities, further investigations are required. Some specific investigations include:
• Mammography
• Chromosome analysis – Klinefelter’s syndrome
• b human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), alphafetoprotein (AFP) – testicular tumour
• Basal serum prolactin – prolactinoma
• CT head – pituitary tumour.

SOURCES OF REPRODUCTIVE
HORMONES
Endocrine signals are essential for implantation and the
maintenance of pregnancy. As the pregnancy progresses,
the hormone levels change, as shown in Fig. 11.12. There
are two phases of hormonal secretion during pregnancy:
• Corpus luteum phase – the corpus luteum secretes
hormones to maintain the endometrium and the developing placenta
• Placental phase – the placenta takes over hormonal
secretion to allow maternal adaptation to pregnancy, birth and lactation.

Corpus luteum phase
In the normal menstrual cycle, the corpus luteum secretes
progesterone and oestrogen for about 10 days following
ovulation, after which it regresses. The dramatic fall

progesterone

• Oestrogen-containing products or oestrogen-like
compounds, e.g. opiates or anabolic steroids
• Hypogonadism or complete gonadal failure; this results in an increase in the oestrogen:testosterone ratio
• Hyperthyroidism and liver cirrhosis can lead to increased synthesis of oestrogens from androstenedione
• Adrenal and testicular tumours.

A clear history will help point to the appropriate investigation but in the absence of a clear cause, general investigations can be undertaken. These include:

Hormones of the reproductive system
in progesterone levels causes degeneration and shedding of the endometrium, resulting in menstruation.
The blastocyst must prevent the next menstruation by
maintaining the corpus luteum and its steroid secretion.
Soon after implantation, around day 6, the syncytiotrophoblast (outer layer of cells) secretes the hormone
human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). This hormone
is equivalent to LH, and it acts on the corpus luteum to
prevent regression. Progesterone levels continue to rise
and the functional endometrium is maintained. The corpus luteum continues to be the main source of progesterone and oestrogen for the first 6 weeks of development.

Placental phase
The placenta secretes the following hormones:
•
•
•
•
•

hCG
Progesterone
Oestrogens
Human placental lactogen (hPL)
Relaxin.

Other hormones include placental GnRH, placental
CRH, placental TRH, placental ACTH, placental inhibin
and placental GH.
By the sixth week the placenta is the main source of
progesterone and oestrogens, which help the mother’s
body adapt to pregnancy. hPL helps regulate nutrient
levels and metabolism; it also causes the glandular tissue of the breast to develop. Relaxin is secreted towards
the end of pregnancy to prepare the body for birth.

Human chorionic gonadotrophin
hCG is a peptide hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast of the conceptus from implantation. It has a
similar structure and actions to LH. These actions include:
• Maintenance of the corpus luteum
• Regulation of placental oestrogen secretion
• Stimulation of testosterone secretion in the male
fetus.
The corpus luteum is initially formed and maintained by the ovulatory LH surge and hCG simply replaces the falling levels of LH to prevent regression.
hCG is secreted for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy until
the placenta is capable of secreting sufficient sex steroids
to maintain the pregnancy. After 8 weeks the corpus
luteum is no longer needed for hormone production
and hCG levels begin to fall.
The b-subunit of hCG can be detected in the urine
just before the first day of a missed period, usually about
6–8 days after potential fertilization. This allows time
for the blastocyst to implant and hCG levels to rise. This
principle is used for the urine pregnancy testing available in hospitals and over the counter in pharmacies.
Since hCG levels fall after the corpus luteal phase these

118

tests no longer work after 20 weeks. False positives may
rarely indicate underlying disease (see the section on
placental disorders).

Progesterone
Plasma levels of progesterone rise throughout pregnancy, secreted initially by the corpus luteum and then
by the placenta. It is the single most important hormone
in the maintenance of pregnancy. Actions include:
• Maintenance and development of the functional
endometrium
• Inhibition of smooth muscle in the uterus to prevent
premature expulsion
• Metabolic changes, including fat storage
• Physiological adaptation to pregnancy
• Relaxation of smooth muscle throughout the body,
which may cause some side effects (e.g. constipation
and oesophageal reflux).

Oestrogens
Plasma levels of oestrogens (especially oestriol) rise
throughout pregnancy, secreted initially by the corpus
luteum and then by the placenta. Like the granulosa
cells, the placenta lacks several key enzymes for the synthesis of oestrogen from cholesterol. These steps must
be performed by the fetal adrenal gland, allowing the fetus to regulate placental oestrogen secretion. This does
not affect progesterone secretion, which is formed from
cholesterol in just two steps.
The actions of oestrogen prepare the body for birth
and lactation. They include:
• Growth of the smooth muscle of the uterus
(myometrium)
• Increased blood flow to the uterus
• Softening of the cervix and pelvic ligaments
• Stimulation of breast growth and development
directly
• Stimulation of pituitary prolactin secretion
• Inhibition of pituitary LH and FSH secretion
• Stimulation of synthesis of oxytocin receptors in the
myometrium in late pregnancy
• Water retention.

Human placental lactogen
hPL is a peptide hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast; levels rise throughout pregnancy. It is sometimes called human chorionic somatomammotropin
because its actions are similar to growth hormone and
prolactin. These actions include:
• Maternal lipolysis (fat breakdown) and fatty acid
metabolism sparing glucose
• Maternal insulin resistance sparing glucose for the
fetus

Other hormonal changes in pregnancy
• Enhancing active amino acid transfer across the
placenta
• Stimulating the growth and development of the
breasts
• Increasing cell growth and protein synthesis.

Relaxin
Relaxin is a peptide hormone secreted by the placenta
late in pregnancy. It relaxes the myometrium, cervix
and the pelvic ligaments, allowing the uterus to enlarge
and the pelvis to stretch during birth. It acts by stimulating collagenase enzymes, which break down collagen in
these tissues.

REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES
FROM OTHER SOURCES

Inhibin
Inhibin is a peptide hormone secreted by the ovary in
the pregnant and non-pregnant state. It may suppress
pituitary FSH secretion and stimulate progesterone production during pregnancy.

Prolactin
The structure, synthesis and control of prolactin is described in Chapter 2. Prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland rises throughout pregnancy due to
stimulation by oestrogens. It has a similar action to
hPL in that it stimulates the growth and development
of the breasts and regulates fat metabolism.
During pregnancy the high levels of placental oestrogens prevent the secretion of milk. After birth the fall in
oestrogen levels allows prolactin to act on the breast. If
the mother breastfeeds the baby, sensory signals from
the nipple cause further prolactin secretion after pregnancy. The high prolactin levels have two effects:
• Secretion of milk, though it is oxytocin that causes
the milk to be ejected
• Inhibition of pituitary FSH and LH, which has a contraceptive effect.

OTHER HORMONAL CHANGES IN
PREGNANCY
The secretion of the anterior pituitary hormones is altered during pregnancy (Fig. 11.13):
• FSH and LH secretion is almost completely stopped
• Prolactin secretion rises throughout pregnancy
• Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion initially falls then increases

11

• Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion
increases
• Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) secretion
increases.
The anterior pituitary gland enlarges as a result of
these changes.
The rise in secretion of most hormones is caused
by direct actions of placental hormones and an increase in plasma binding proteins (caused by the
action of oestrogens on the liver) that reduces negative feedback.

Thyroid glands
hCG is structurally similar to TSH and inhibits TSH secretion in the first trimester but, as the hCG levels fall
in the second and third trimesters, TSH then rises
above normal. The increase in TSH, together with a reduction in iodine from the overactive kidneys, causes
the thyroid gland to enlarge to trap sufficient iodine.
Pregnancy is a state of relative maternal iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormone synthesis also increases
but so does the synthesis of thyroid-hormone-binding
proteins stimulated by oestrogen. Overall, maternal
active/free thyroid hormone levels remain normal.
The fetal thyroid secretes thyroxine from 12 weeks; this
is independent of maternal control as TSH does not
cross the placenta.

Adrenal glands
In contrast, free cortisol levels do rise, despite the increase in plasma-binding proteins. This raises amino
acid and glucose levels in the blood to improve fetal
growth.
Aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex also
rises slowly in response to the rising ACTH levels. It
helps prevent the sodium loss caused by the raised
GFR in the kidney.

Changes in metabolism
The mother usually gains 9–15 kg during pregnancy,
though the majority of this is caused by the fetus, placenta and fluid retention. Six months after birth, maternal weight is usually just 1 kg higher than before the
pregnancy. Women have a larger appetite during pregnancy to supply the developing fetus, placenta and
breasts. The excess of nutrients is regulated by changes
in metabolism.

Carbohydrates
The hormone hPL causes insulin resistance to develop
by stimulating insulin-like growth factor and this effect
is enhanced by the raised cortisol. Insulin production is

119

Hormones of the reproductive system
nearly doubled. The renal threshold for glucose falls and
most pregnant women will lose glucose in the urine
(glycosuria). As a result, the maternal metabolism uses
a higher proportion of fatty acids and glucose use decreases. Pregnancy is a state of progressive insulin resistance due to hPL. This glucose is spared for the growing
fetus.
If the mother already has a degree of impaired glucose tolerance (e.g. obesity), then diabetes mellitus can
result. The glucose levels should be strictly controlled
because hyperglycaemia predisposes to large babies,
difficult births and other paediatric complications.
After birth, this gestational diabetes mellitus usually
resolves.

Amino acids
Progesterone inhibits the breakdown of amino acids in
the liver to increase their availability for the fetus. The
raised cortisol also increases the blood levels while
hPL aids transport across the placenta.

Fat
Fat stores are initially broken down through the action of
hPL to drive maternal metabolism. Towards the end of
pregnancy, fat is stored in the breasts and subcutaneous
tissues. Fat only accounts for a fraction of weight gain
through pregnancy.

HORMONAL CONTROL OF
PARTURITION

Oxytocin
Oxytocin is a peptide hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland
(it is described in Chapter 2).
During labour, oxytocin levels rise due to cervical
stimulation by the head. It stimulates uterine contractions that push the fetus against the cervix, stimulating
further oxytocin release. A positive feedback mechanism
develops called the Ferguson reflex.
Oxytocin receptors in the uterine muscle are increased
during late pregnancy by the action of oestrogen. Oxytocin binding stimulates prostaglandin production, which
causes the increased contractility (especially PGE2) and
potentiates ion channels, which allow the reflux of
Ca2 þ and Naþ. Stimulation of receptors by oxytocin
may also lead to an increase in intracellular Ca2 þ from
sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Prostaglandins
Prostaglandins are locally acting eicosanoids that regulate many processes throughout the body (see
Chapter 1). During labour, the prostaglandin PGE2 is

synthesized in the uterine muscle cells in response to
oxytocin. It increases gap junctions and stimulates the
release of calcium ions, which cause muscle contractions in a similar fashion to oxytocin.
PGE2 is also synthesized in the cervix, where it stimulates cervical softening and dilatation, known as
ripening.

HORMONES AND LACTATION
Lactation is caused by the effects of two hormones:

+

+

• Prolactin – causes milk secretion
• Oxytocin – causes milk ejection.
Both hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland in response to nipple stimulation. Prolactin is secreted by
the anterior pituitary gland, with production increased
by frequent suckling, and oxytocin is secreted by the
hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary.
The synthesis and secretion of these hormones are
described in Chapter 2.

and secretion of milk

breast

Prolactin
Prolactin secretion increases throughout pregnancy,
causing the acinar cells of the breast to develop. During
pregnancy, milk production is inhibited by high oestrogen levels. After childbirth, oestrogen levels fall dramatically and prolactin stimulates the secretion of milk.
During breastfeeding, stimulation of the nipple
causes prolactin secretion, resulting in milk secretion
and maintenance of the breast. The milk accumulates
within the breast, causing swelling unless oxytocin triggers the milk to be ejected. This neuroendocrine reflex is
shown in Fig. 11.14. Once breastfeeding is stopped, nipple stimulation diminishes so prolactin secretion and
milk production cease.
The high levels of prolactin during lactation inhibit
LH and FSH secretion, giving breastfeeding a contraceptive effect. This is only effective while the baby is suckling regularly. Once lactation ceases, the normal ovarian
cycle and fertility return within 4–5 weeks.

Fig. 11.14 Regulation of lactation by prolactin and
oxytocin.

Oxytocin
Milk is ejected from the breast by the action of hormonal, rather than neural, signals on the smooth muscle in the breast. Oxytocin induces the smooth muscle
cells surrounding the acini to contract so milk is
squeezed out of the nipple. Suckling stimulates this oxytocin release, causing milk ejection within about 30 seconds. The reflex is shown in Fig. 11.14. Even the sound
of the baby crying can stimulate the release of oxytocin
and the ejection of milk. On the other hand, emotional
stress can inhibit this reflex and this can be a particular
problem if the woman is worried about her ability to
breastfeed.

PREFACE

I have been deeply amazed and grateful to see how the Case Files® books have been
so well received, and have helped students to learn more effectively. In the 10 short
years since Case Files®: Internal Medicine has first made it in print, the series has
now multiplied to span the most of the clinical and the basic science disciplines,
and has been translated into over a dozen foreign languages. Numerous students
have sent encouraging remarks, suggestions, and recommendations, Three completely new cases have been written. Updated or new sections include health maintenance, nephritic syndrome, arthritis, diabetes, heart failure, and hyperlipidemia.
This fourth edition has been a collaborative work with my wonderful coauthors and
contributors, and with the suggestions from four generations of students. Truly, the
enthusiastic encouragement from students throughout not just the United States
but worldwide provides me the inspiration and energy to continue to write. It is thus
with humility that I offer my sincere thanks to students everywhere ... for without
students, how can a teacher teach?

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The curriculum that evolved into the ideas for this series was inspired by Philbert
Yau and Chuck Rosipal, two talented and forthright students, who have since
graduated from medical school. It has been a tremendous joy to work with my
excellent coauthors, especially Dr. John Patlan, who exemplifies the qualities of
the ideal physician—caring, empathetic, and avid teacher, and who is intellectually
unparalleled. Dr. Patlan would like to acknowledge several excellent medical students
from the University of Texas Medical School who thoughtfully reviewed many of
the cases and offered detailed advice on how to improve this book: Adam Banks,
Irving Basanez, Hubert Chodkiewicz, Stephen Fisher, Amber Gill, Matthew Hogue,
Michael Holmes, Luke Martin, Colin Massey, and Janice Wilson.
I am greatly indebted to my editor, Catherine Johnson, whose exuberance,
experience, and vision helped to shape this series. I appreciate McGraw-Hill’s
believing in the concept of teaching through clinical cases. I am also grateful to
Catherine Saggese for her excellent production expertise, and Cindy Yoo for her
wonderful editing. I cherish the ever-organized and precise Ridhi Mathur project
manager. It has been a privilege and honor to work with one of the brightest
medical students I have encountered, Molly Dudley who was the principal student
reviewer of this book. She enthusiastically provided feedback and helped to
emphasize the right material. I appreciate Linda Bergstrom for her sage advice and
support. At Methodist, I appreciate Drs. Judy Paukert, Dirk Sostman, Marc Boom,
and Alan Kaplan who have welcomed our residents; Debby Chambers, a brilliant
administrator and Linda Elliott, who holds the department together. Without my
dear colleagues, Drs. Konrad Harms, Priti Schachel, and Gizelle Brooks Carter,
this book could not have been written. Most of all, I appreciate my ever-loving
wife Terri, and our four wonderful children, Andy, Michael, Allison, and Christina,
for their patience and understanding.

INTRODUCTION

Mastering the cognitive knowledge within a field such as internal medicine is a
formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, procure and
filter through the clinical and laboratory data, develop a differential diagnosis, and,
finally, to make a rational treatment plan. To gain these skills, the student learns best
at the bedside, guided and instructed by experienced teachers, and inspired toward
self-directed, diligent reading. Clearly, there is no replacement for education at the
bedside. Unfortunately, clinical situations usually do not encompass the breadth of
the specialty. Perhaps the best alternative is a carefully crafted patient case designed
to stimulate the clinical approach and the decision-making process. In an attempt to
achieve that goal, we have constructed a collection of clinical vignettes to teach
diagnostic or therapeutic approaches relevant to internal medicine.
Most importantly, the explanations for the cases emphasize the mechanisms and
underlying principles, rather than merely rote questions and answers. This book is
organized for versatility: it allows the student “in a rush” to go quickly through the
scenarios and check the corresponding answers, and it allows the student who wants
thought-provoking explanations to obtain them. The answers are arranged from simple
to complex: the bare answers, an analysis of the case, an approach to the pertinent
topic, a comprehension test at the end, clinical pearls for emphasis, and a list of references for further reading. The clinical vignettes are purposely placed in random order
to simulate the way that real patients present to the practitioner. A listing of cases is
included in Section III to aid the student who desires to test his/her knowledge of a
certain area, or to review a topic, including basic definitions. Finally, we intentionally
did not use a multiple choice question format in the case scenarios, because clues
(or distractions) are not available in the real world.

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS BOOK
Each case is designed to simulate a patient encounter with open-ended questions.
At times, the patient’s complaint is different from the most concerning issue, and
sometimes extraneous information is given. The answers are organized into four
different parts:

CLINICAL CASE FORMAT: PART I
1.

2.

Summary: The salient aspects of the case are identiﬁed, ﬁltering out the extraneous information. Students should formulate their summary from the case before
looking at the answers. A comparison to the summation in the answer will help
to improve their ability to focus on the important data, while appropriately
discarding the irrelevant information—a fundamental skill in clinical problem
solving.
A Straightforward Answer is given to each open-ended question.

INTRODUCTION

The Analysis of the Case is comprised of two parts:
a. Objectives of the Case: A listing of the two or three main principles that
are crucial for a practitioner to manage the patient. Again, the students are
challenged to make educated “guesses” about the objectives of the case upon
initial review of the case scenario, which helps to sharpen their clinical and
analytical skills.
b. Considerations: A discussion of the relevant points and brief approach to
the speciﬁc patient.

PART II
Approach to the Disease Process: It consists of two distinct parts:
a. Deﬁnitions: Terminology pertinent to the disease process.
b. Clinical Approach: A discussion of the approach to the clinical problem in
general, including tables, ﬁgures, and algorithms.

PART III
Comprehension Questions: Each case contains several multiple-choice questions,
which reinforce the material, or which introduce new and related concepts. Questions
about material not found in the text will have explanations in the answers.

PART IV
Clinical Pearls: Several clinically important points are reiterated as a summation of
the text. This allows for easy review, such as before an examination.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Part 1. Approach to the Patient
The transition from the textbook or journal article to the clinical situation is one
of the most challenging tasks in medicine. Retention of information is difficult;
organization of the facts and recall of a myriad of data in precise application to
the patient is crucial. The purpose of this text is to facilitate in this process. The
first step is gathering information, also known as establishing the database. This
includes taking the history (asking questions), performing the physical examination, and obtaining selective laboratory and/or imaging tests. Of these, the historical
examination is the most important and useful. Sensitivity and respect should always
be exercised during the interview of patients.

CLINICAL PEARL


The history is the single most important tool in obtaining a diagnosis. All
physical findings and laboratory and imaging studies are first obtained and
then interpreted in the light of the pertinent history.

HISTORY
1. Basic information: Age, gender, and ethnicity must be recorded because some
conditions are more common at certain ages; for instance, pain on defecation
and rectal bleeding in a 20-year-old may indicate inflammatory bowel disease,
whereas the same symptoms in a 60-year-old would more likely suggest colon
cancer.
2. Chief complaint: What is it that brought the patient into the hospital or clinic?
Is it a scheduled appointment, or an unexpected symptom? The patient’s own
words should be used if possible, such as, “I feel like a ton of bricks are on my
chest.” The chief complaint, or real reason for seeking medical attention, may
not be the first subject the patient talks about (in fact, it may be the last thing),
particularly if the subject is embarrassing, such as a sexually transmitted disease,
or highly emotional, such as depression. It is often useful to clarify exactly what
the patient’s concern is, for example, they may fear their headaches represent an
underlying brain tumor.
3. History of present illness: This is the most crucial part of the entire database.
The questions one asks are guided by the differential diagnosis one begins to
consider the moment the patient identifies the chief complaint, as well as the
clinician’s knowledge of typical disease patterns and their natural history. The
duration and character of the primary complaint, associated symptoms, and
exacerbating/relieving factors should be recorded. Sometimes, the history will
be convoluted and lengthy, with multiple diagnostic or therapeutic interventions at different locations. For patients with chronic illnesses, obtaining prior
medical records is invaluable. For example, when extensive evaluation of a complicated medical problem has been done elsewhere, it is usually better to first

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

obtain those results than to repeat a “million-dollar workup.” When reviewing
prior records, it is often useful to review the primary data (eg, biopsy reports,
echocardiograms, serologic evaluations) rather than to rely upon a diagnostic
label applied by someone else, which then gets replicated in medical records and
by repetition, acquires the aura of truth, when it may not be fully supported by
data. Some patients will be poor historians because of dementia, confusion, or
language barriers; recognition of these situations and querying of family members is useful. When little or no history is available to guide a focused investigation, more extensive objective studies are often necessary to exclude potentially
serious diagnoses.
4. Past history:
a. Illness: Any illnesses such as hypertension, hepatitis, diabetes mellitus,
cancer, heart disease, pulmonary disease, and thyroid disease should be elicited. If an existing or prior diagnosis is not obvious, it is useful to ask exactly
how it was diagnosed; that is, what investigations were performed. Duration,
severity, and therapies should be included.
b. Hospitalization: Any hospitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits should
be listed with the reason(s) for admission, the intervention, and the location
of the hospital.
c. Blood transfusion: Transfusions with any blood products should be listed,
including any adverse reactions.
d. Surgeries: The year and type of surgery should be elucidated and any complications documented. The type of incision and any untoward effects of the
anesthesia or the surgery should be noted.
5. Allergies: Reactions to medications should be recorded, including severity and
temporal relationship to the medication. An adverse effect (such as nausea)
should be differentiated from a true allergic reaction.
6. Medications: Current and previous medications should be listed, including dosage, route, frequency, and duration of use. Prescription, over-the-counter, and
herbal medications are all relevant. Patients often forget their complete medication list; thus, asking each patient to bring in all their medications—both prescribed and nonprescribed—allows for a complete inventory.
7. Family history: Many conditions are inherited, or are predisposed in family members. The age and health of siblings, parents, grandparents, and others
can provide diagnostic clues. For instance, an individual with first-degree family members with early onset coronary heart disease is at risk for cardiovascular
disease.
8. Social history: This is one of the most important parts of the history in that the
patient’s functional status at home, social and economic circumstances, and goals
and aspirations for the future are often the critical determinant in what the best
way to manage a patient’s medical problem is. Living arrangements, economic
situations, and religious affiliations may provide important clues for puzzling diagnostic
cases, or suggest the acceptability of various diagnostic or therapeutic options. Marital

4

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

status and habits such as alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use may be relevant as risk
factors for disease.
9. Review of systems: A few questions about each major body system ensure that problems will not be overlooked. The clinician should avoid the mechanical “rapid-fire”
questioning technique that discourages patients from answering truthfully because of
fear of “annoying the doctor.”

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The physical examination begins as one is taking the history, by observing the patient and
beginning to consider a differential diagnosis. When performing the physical examination,
one focuses on body systems suggested by the differential diagnosis, and performs tests or
maneuvers with specific questions in mind; for example, does the patient with jaundice
have ascites? When the physical examination is performed with potential diagnoses and
expected physical findings in mind (“one sees what one looks for”), the utility of the
examination in adding to diagnostic yield is greatly increased, as opposed to an unfocused
“head-to-toe” physical.
1. General appearance: A great deal of information is gathered by observation, as
one notes the patient’s body habitus, state of grooming, nutritional status, level of
anxiety (or perhaps inappropriate indifference), degree of pain or comfort, mental
status, speech patterns, and use of language. This forms your impression of “who this
patient is.”
2. Vital signs: Vital signs like temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
height, and weight are often placed here. Blood pressure can sometimes be different in
the two arms; initially, it should be measured in both arms. In patients with suspected
hypovolemia, pulse and blood pressure should be taken in lying and standing positions
to look for orthostatic hypotension. It is quite useful to take the vital signs oneself,
rather than relying upon numbers gathered by ancillary personnel using automated
equipment, because important decisions regarding patient care are often made using
the vital signs as an important determining factor.
3. Head and neck examination: Facial or periorbital edema and pupillary responses
should be noted. Funduscopic examination provides a way to visualize the effects of
diseases such as diabetes on the microvasculature; papilledema can signify increased
intracranial pressure. Estimation of jugular venous pressure is very useful to estimate
volume status. The thyroid should be palpated for a goiter or nodule, and carotid
arteries auscultated for bruits. Cervical (common) and supraclavicular (pathologic)
nodes should be palpated.
4. Breast examination: Inspect for symmetry and for, skin or nipple retraction with the
patient’s hands on her hips (to accentuate the pectoral muscles) and also with
arms raised. With the patient sitting and supine, the breasts should then be
palpated systematically to assess for masses. The nipple should be assessed for
discharge, and the axillary and supraclavicular regions should be examined for
adenopathy.

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

5

5. Cardiac examination: The point of maximal impulse (PMI) should be ascertained for size and location, and the heart auscultated at the apex of the heart as
well as at the base. Heart sounds, murmurs, and clicks should be characterized.
Murmurs should be classified according to intensity, duration, timing in the
cardiac cycle, and changes with various maneuvers. Systolic murmurs are very
common and often physiologic; diastolic murmurs are uncommon and usually
pathologic.
6. Pulmonary examination: The lung fields should be examined systematically
and thoroughly. Wheezes, rales, rhonchi, and bronchial breath sounds should be
recorded. Percussion of the lung fields may be helpful in identifying the hyperresonance of tension pneumothorax, or the dullness of consolidated pneumonia
or a pleural effusion.
7. Abdominal examination: The abdomen should be inspected for scars, distension, or discoloration (such as the Grey Turner sign of discoloration at the flank
areas indicating intraabdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage). Auscultation
of bowel sounds to identify normal versus high-pitched and hyperactive versus
hypoactive. Percussion of the abdomen can be utilized to assess the size of
the liver and spleen, and to detect ascites by noting shifting dullness. Careful
palpation should begin initially away from the area of pain, involving one
hand on top of the other, to assess for masses, tenderness, and peritoneal signs.
Tenderness should be recorded on a scale (eg, 1-4 where 4 is the most severe
pain). Guarding, and whether it is voluntary or involuntary, should be noted.
8. Back and spine examination: The back should be assessed for symmetry, tenderness, and masses. The flank regions are particularly important to assess for
pain on percussion, which might indicate renal disease.
9. Genitalia:
a. Females: The pelvic examination should include an inspection of the external genitalia, and with the speculum, evaluation of the vagina and cervix.
A pap smear and/or cervical cultures may be obtained. A bimanual examination to assess the size, shape, and tenderness of the uterus and adnexa is
important.
b. Males: An inspection of the penis and testes is performed. Evaluation for
masses, tenderness, and lesions is important. Palpation for hernias in the
inguinal region with the patient coughing to increase intraabdominal pressure is useful.
10. Rectal examination: A digital rectal examination is generally performed for
those individuals with possible colorectal disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
Masses should be assessed, and stool for occult blood should be tested. In men,
the prostate gland can be assessed for enlargement and for nodules.
11. Extremities: An examination for joint effusions, tenderness, edema, and cyanosis may be helpful. Clubbing of the nails might indicate pulmonary diseases such
as lung cancer or chronic cyanotic heart disease.

6

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

12. Neurologic examination: Patients who present with neurologic complaints
usually require a thorough assessment, including the mental status, cranial
nerves, motor strength, sensation, and reflexes.
13. Skin examination: The skin should be carefully examined for evidence of pigmented lesions (melanoma), cyanosis, or rashes that may indicate systemic disease (malar rash of systemic lupus erythematosus).

LABORATORY AND IMAGING ASSESSMENT
1. Laboratory:
a. Complete blood count (CBC): To assess for anemia and thrombocytopenia.
b. Serum chemistry: Chemistry panel is most commonly used to evaluate renal
and liver function.
c. Lipid panel: Lipid panel is particularly relevant in cardiovascular diseases.
d. Urinalysis: Urinalysis is often referred to as a “liquid renal biopsy,” because
the presence of cells, casts, protein, or bacteria provides clues about underlying glomerular or tubular diseases.
e. Infection: Gram stain and culture of urine, sputum, and cerebrospinal fluid,
as well as blood cultures, are frequently useful to isolate the cause of infection.
2. Imaging procedures:
a. Chest radiography: Chest radiography is extremely useful in assessing cardiac size and contour, chamber enlargement, pulmonary vasculature and infiltrates, and the presence of pleural effusions.
b. Ultrasonographic examination: Ultrasonographic examination is useful for
identifying fluid-solid interfaces, and for characterizing masses as cystic, solid,
or complex. It is also very helpful in evaluating the biliary tree, kidney size,
and evidence of ureteral obstruction, and can be combined with Doppler flow
to identify deep venous thrombosis. Ultrasonography is noninvasive and has
no radiation risk, but cannot be used to penetrate through bone or air, and is
less useful in obese patients.

CLINICAL PEARL


Ultrasonography is helpful in evaluating the biliary tree, looking for
ureteral obstruction, and evaluating vascular structures, but has limited
utility in obese patients.

c. Computed tomography: Computed tomography (CT) is helpful in possible intracranial bleeding, abdominal and/or pelvic masses, and pulmonary
processes, and may help to delineate the lymph nodes and retroperitoneal
disorders. CT exposes the patient to radiation and requires the patient to be
immobilized during the procedure. Generally, CT requires administration of a
radiocontrast dye, which can be nephrotoxic.

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

7

d. Magnetic resonance imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identifies soft-tissue planes very well and provides the best imaging of the brain
parenchyma. When used with gadolinium contrast (which is not nephrotoxic),
MR angiography (MRA) is useful for delineating vascular structures. MRI does
not use radiation, but the powerful magnetic field prohibits its use in patients
with ferromagnetic metal in their bodies, for example, many prosthetic devices.
e. Cardiac procedures:
i. Echocardiography: Uses ultrasonography to delineate the cardiac size,
function, ejection fraction, and presence of valvular dysfunction.
ii. Angiography: Radiopaque dye is injected into various vessels, and radiographs or fluoroscopic images are used to determine the vascular occlusion, cardiac function, or valvular integrity.
iii. Stress treadmill tests: Individuals at risk for coronary heart disease are
monitored for blood pressure, heart rate, chest pain, and electrocardiogram (ECG) while increasing oxygen demands on the heart, such as running on a treadmill. Nuclear medicine imaging of the heart can be added
to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Individuals who cannot run on the treadmill (such as those with severe arthritis) may be given
medications such as adenosine or dobutamine to “stress” the heart.

INTERPRETATION OF TEST RESULTS: USING PRETEST
PROBABILITY AND LIKELIHOOD RATIO
Because no test is 100% accurate, it is essential when ordering a test to have some
knowledge of the test’s characteristics, as well as how to apply the test results to an
individual patient’s clinical situation. Let us use the example of a patient with chest
pain. The first diagnostic concern of most patients and physicians regarding chest
pain is angina pectoris, that is, the pain of myocardial ischemia caused by coronary insufficiency. Distinguishing angina pectoris from other causes of chest pain
relies upon two important factors: the clinical history, and an understanding of how
to use objective testing. In making the diagnosis of angina pectoris, the clinician
must establish whether the pain satisfies the three criteria for typical anginal pain:
(1) retrosternal in location, (2) precipitated by exertion, and (3) relieved within
minutes by rest or nitroglycerin. Then, the clinician considers other factors, such
as patient age and other risk factors, to determine a pretest probability for angina
pectoris.
After a pretest probability is estimated by applying some combination of statistical data, epidemiology of the disease, and clinical experience, the next decision is whether and how to use an objective test. A test should only be ordered
if the results would change the posttest probability high enough or low enough
in either direction that it will affect the decision-making process. For example, a
21-year-old woman with chest pain that is not exertional and not relieved by rest
or nitroglycerin has a very low pretest probability of coronary artery disease, and
any positive results on a cardiac stress test are very likely to be false positive. Any test
result is unlikely to change her management; thus, the test should not be obtained.

8

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Similarly, a 69-year-old diabetic smoker with a recent coronary angioplasty who now
has recurrent episodes of typical angina has a very high pretest probability that the
pain is a result of myocardial ischemia. One could argue that a negative cardiac stress
test is likely to be falsely negative, and that the clinician should proceed directly to
a coronary angiography to assess for a repeat angioplasty. Diagnostic tests, therefore,
are usually most useful for those patients in the midranges of pretest probabilities in
whom a positive or negative test will move the clinician past some decision threshold.
In the case of diagnosing a patient with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease
(CAD), one test that is frequently used is the exercise treadmill test. Patients are
monitored on an electrocardiogram, while they perform graded exercise on a treadmill. A positive test is the development of ST-segment depression during the test;
the greater the degree of ST depression, the more useful the test becomes in raising
the posttest probability of CAD. In the example illustrated by Figure I–1, if a patient
has a pretest probability of CAD of 50%, then the test result of 2 mm of ST-segment
depression raises the posttest probability to 90%.

If one knows the sensitivity and specificity of the test used, one can calculate
the likelihood ratio of the positive test as sensitivity/(1 - specificity). Posttest
probability is calculated by multiplying the positive likelihood ratio by the pretest
probability, or plotting the probabilities using a nomogram (see Figure I–1).
Thus, knowing something about the characteristics of the test you are employing,
and how to apply them to the patient at hand is essential in reaching a correct diagnosis and to avoid falling into the common trap of “positive test = disease” and “negative test = no disease.” Stated another way, tests do not make diagnoses; doctors do,
considering test results quantitatively in the context of their clinical assessment.

If test result is positive,
Posttest Probability = Pretest Probability × Likelihood Ratio
Likelihood Ratio = Sensitivity/(1 – Specificity)

Part 2. Approach to Clinical Problem Solving
There are typically four distinct steps to the systematic solving of clinical problems:
1. Making the diagnosis
2. Assessing the severity of the disease (stage)
3. Rendering a treatment based on the stage of the disease
4. Following the patient’s response to the treatment

MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS
There are two ways to make a diagnosis. Experienced clinicians often make a diagnosis very quickly using pattern recognition, that is, the features of the patient’s
illness match a scenario the physician has seen before. If it does not fit a readily
recognized pattern, then one has to undertake several steps in diagnostic reasoning:
1. The first step is to gather information with a differential diagnosis in mind.
The clinician should start considering diagnostic possibilities with initial contact with the patient, which are continually refined as information is gathered.
Historical questions and physical examination tests and findings are all tailored
to the potential diagnoses one is considering. This is the principle that “you find
what you are looking for.” When one is trying to perform a thorough head-totoe examination, for instance, without looking for anything in particular, one is
much more likely to miss findings.
2. The next step is to try to move from subjective complaints or nonspecific
symptoms to focus on objective abnormalities in an effort to conceptualize the
patient’s objective problem with the greatest specificity one can achieve. For

10

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

example, a patient may come to the physician complaining of pedal edema, a
relatively common and nonspecific finding. Laboratory testing may reveal that
the patient has renal failure, a more specific cause of the many causes of edema.
Examination of the urine may then reveal red blood cell casts, indicating glomerulonephritis, which is even more specific as the cause of the renal failure.
The patient’s problem, then, described with the greatest degree of specificity,
is glomerulonephritis. The clinician’s task at this point is to consider the differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis rather than that of pedal edema.
3. The last step is to look for discriminating features of the patient’s illness. This
means the features of the illness, which by their presence or their absence narrow the differential diagnosis. This is often difficult for junior learners because it
requires a well-developed knowledge base of the typical features of disease, so the
diagnostician can judge how much weight to assign to the various clinical clues
present. For example, in the diagnosis of a patient with a fever and productive
cough, the finding by chest x-ray of bilateral apical infiltrates with cavitation is
highly discriminatory. There are few illnesses besides tuberculosis that are likely
to produce that radiographic pattern. A negatively predictive example is a patient
with exudative pharyngitis who also has rhinorrhea and cough. The presence of
these features makes the diagnosis of streptococcal infection unlikely as the cause of
the pharyngitis. Once the differential diagnosis has been constructed, the clinician
uses the presence of discriminating features, knowledge of patient risk factors, and
the epidemiology of diseases to decide which potential diagnoses are most likely.

CLINICAL PEARL


There are three steps in diagnostic reasoning:
1. Gathering information with a differential diagnosis in mind
2. Identifying the objective abnormalities with the greatest specificity
3. Looking for discriminating features to narrow the differential diagnosis

Once the most specific problem has been identified, and a differential diagnosis
of that problem is considered using discriminating features to order the possibilities,
the next step is to consider using diagnostic testing, such as laboratory, radiologic,
or pathologic data, to confirm the diagnosis. Quantitative reasoning in the use and
interpretation of tests was discussed in Part 1. Clinically, the timing and effort with
which one pursues a definitive diagnosis using objective data depend on several
factors: the potential gravity of the diagnosis in question, the clinical state of the
patient, the potential risks of diagnostic testing, and the potential benefits or harms
of empiric treatment. For example, if a young man is admitted to the hospital with
bilateral pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray, there are many possibilities including
metastatic malignancy, and aggressive pursuit of a diagnosis is necessary, perhaps
including a thoracotomy with an open-lung biopsy. The same radiographic findings
in an elderly bed-bound woman with advanced Alzheimer dementia who would not

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

11

be a good candidate for chemotherapy might be best left alone without any diagnostic testing. Decisions like this are difficult, require solid medical knowledge, as
well as a thorough understanding of one’s patient and the patient’s background and
inclinations, and constitute the art of medicine.

ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE
After ascertaining the diagnosis, the next step is to characterize the severity of the
disease process; in other words, it is describing “how bad” a disease is. There is usually prognostic or treatment significance based on the stage. With malignancy, this
is done formally by cancer staging. Most cancers are categorized from stage I (localized) to stage IV (widely metastatic). Some diseases, such as congestive heart failure,
may be designated as mild, moderate, or severe based on the patient’s functional status, that is, their ability to exercise before becoming dyspneic. With some infections,
such as syphilis, the staging depends on the duration and extent of the infection, and
follows along the natural history of the infection (ie, primary syphilis, secondary,
latent period, and tertiary/neurosyphilis).

RENDERING A TREATMENT BASED ON
THE STAGE OF THE DISEASE
Many illnesses are stratified according to severity because prognosis and treatment
often vary based on the severity. If neither the prognosis nor the treatment was
affected by the stage of the disease process, there would not be a reason to subcategorize as mild or severe. As an example, a man with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be treated with inhaled bronchodilators as needed and
advice for smoking cessation. However, an individual with severe COPD may need
round-the-clock oxygen supplementation, scheduled bronchodilators, and possibly
oral corticosteroid therapy.
The treatment should be tailored to the extent or “stage” of the disease. In
making decisions regarding treatment, it is also essential that the clinician identify
the therapeutic objectives. When patients seek medical attention, it is generally
because they are bothered by a symptom and want it to go away. When physicians
institute therapy, they often have several other goals besides symptom relief, such
as prevention of short- or long-term complications or a reduction in mortality. For
example, patients with congestive heart failure are bothered by the symptoms of
edema and dyspnea. Salt restriction, loop diuretics, and bed rest are effective at
reducing these symptoms. However, heart failure is a progressive disease with a high
mortality, so other treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and some beta-blockers are also used to reduce mortality in this condition. It is
essential that the clinician know what the therapeutic objective is, so that one can
monitor and guide therapy.

CLINICAL PEARL


The clinician needs to identify the objectives of therapy: symptom relief,
prevention of complications, or reduction in mortality.

12

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

FOLLOWING THE PATIENT’S RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT
The final step in the approach to disease is to follow the patient’s response to
the therapy. The “measure” of response should be recorded and monitored. Some
responses are clinical, such as the patient’s abdominal pain, or temperature, or
pulmonary examination. Obviously, the student must work on being more skilled in
eliciting the data in an unbiased and standardized manner. Other responses may be
followed by imaging tests, such as CT scan of a retroperitoneal node size in a patient
receiving chemotherapy, or a tumor marker such as the prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) level in a man receiving chemotherapy for prostatic cancer. For syphilis, it
may be the nonspecific treponemal antibody test rapid plasma reagent (RPR) titer
over time. The student must be prepared to know what to do if the measured marker
does not respond according to what is expected. Is the next step to retreat, or to
repeat the metastatic workup, or to follow up with another more specific test?

Part 3. Approach to Reading
The clinical problem–oriented approach to reading is different from the classic “systematic” research of a disease. Patients rarely present with a clear diagnosis; hence,
the student must become skilled in applying the textbook information to the clinical setting. Furthermore, one retains more information when one reads with a purpose. In other words, the student should read with the goal of answering specific
questions. There are several fundamental questions that facilitate clinical thinking.
These questions are:
1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
2. What should be the next step?
3. What is the most likely mechanism for this process?
4. What are the risk factors for this condition?
5. What are the complications associated with the disease process?
6. What is the best therapy?
7. How would you confirm the diagnosis?

CLINICAL PEARL


Reading with the purpose of answering the seven fundamental clinical
questions improves retention of information and facilitates the application
of “book knowledge” to “clinical knowledge.”

WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSIS?
The method of establishing the diagnosis was discussed in the previous part. One
way of attacking this problem is to develop standard “approaches” to common

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

13

clinical problems. It is helpful to understand the most common causes of various
presentations, such as “the most common causes of pancreatitis are gallstones and
alcohol.” (See the Clinical Pearls at end of each case.)
The clinical scenario would entail something such as:
A 28-year-old pregnant woman complains of severe epigastric pain radiating to
the back, nausea and vomiting, and an elevated serum amylase level. What is the
most likely diagnosis?
With no other information to go on, the student would note that this woman has
a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis. Using the “most common cause” information,
the student would make an educated guess that the patient has gallstones, because
being female and pregnant are risk factors. If, instead, cholelithiasis is removed from
the equation of this scenario, a phrase may be added such as:
“The ultrasonogram of the gallbladder shows no stones.”

CLINICAL PEARL


The two most common causes of pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol
abuse.

Now, the student would use the phrase “patients without gallstones who have
pancreatitis most likely abuse alcohol.” Aside from these two causes, there are many
other etiologies of pancreatitis.

WHAT SHOULD BE THE NEXT STEP?
This question is difficult because the next step may be more diagnostic information,
or staging, or therapy. It may be more challenging than “the most likely diagnosis,”
because there may be insufficient information to make a diagnosis and the next step
may be to pursue more diagnostic information. Another possibility is that there is
enough information for a probable diagnosis, and the next step is to stage the disease.
Finally, the most appropriate action may be to treat. Hence, from clinical data, a
judgment needs to be rendered regarding how far along one is on the road of:
Make a diagnosis → Stage the disease → Treatment based on stage → Follow response
Frequently, the student is “taught” to regurgitate the same information that
someone has written about a particular disease, but is not skilled at giving the next
step. This talent is learned optimally at the bedside, in a supportive environment,
with freedom to make educated guesses, and with constructive feedback. A sample
scenario may describe a student’s thought process as follows:
1. Make the diagnosis: “Based on the information I have, I believe that Mr. Smith
has stable angina because he has retrosternal chest pain when he walks three
blocks, but it is relieved within minutes by rest and with sublingual nitroglycerin.”
2. Stage the disease: “I don’t believe that this is severe disease because he does not
have pain lasting for more than 5 minutes, angina at rest, or congestive heart
failure.”

14

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

3. Treatment based on stage: “Therefore, my next step is to treat with aspirin, betablockers, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as well as lifestyle changes.”
4. Follow response: “I want to follow the treatment by assessing his pain (I will
ask him about the degree of exercise he is able to perform without chest pain),
performing a cardiac stress test, and reassessing him after the test is done.”
In a similar patient, when the clinical presentation is unclear or more severe,
perhaps the best “next step” may be diagnostic in nature such as thallium stress test,
or even coronary angiography. The next step depends upon the clinical state of
the patient (if unstable, the next step is therapeutic), the potential severity of the
disease (the next step may be staging), or the uncertainty of the diagnosis (the next
step is diagnostic).
Usually, the vague question, “What is your next step?” is the most difficult question, because the answer may be diagnostic, staging, or therapeutic.

WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY MECHANISM FOR THIS PROCESS?
This question goes further than making the diagnosis, but also requires the student
to understand the underlying mechanism for the process. For example, a clinical
scenario may describe an “18-year-old woman who presents with several months of
severe epistaxis, heavy menses, petechiae, and a normal CBC except for a platelet
count of 15,000/mm3.” Answers that a student may consider to explain this condition
include immune-mediated platelet destruction, drug-induced thrombocytopenia,
bone marrow suppression, and platelet sequestration as a result of hypersplenism.
The student is advised to learn the mechanisms for each disease process, and
not merely memorize a constellation of symptoms. In other words, rather than
solely committing to memory the classic presentation of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (isolated thrombocytopenia without lymphadenopathy
or offending drugs), the student should understand that ITP is an autoimmune
process whereby the body produces IgG antibodies against the platelets. The
platelet-antibody complexes are then taken from the circulation in the spleen.
Because the disease process is specific for platelets, the other two cell lines
(erythrocytes and leukocytes) are normal. Also, because the thrombocytopenia is
caused by excessive platelet peripheral destruction, the bone marrow will show
increased megakaryocytes (platelet precursors). Hence, treatment for ITP includes
oral corticosteroid agents to decrease the immune process of antiplatelet IgG production, and, if refractory, then splenectomy.

WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR THIS PROCESS?
Understanding the risk factors helps the practitioner to establish a diagnosis and to
determine how to interpret tests. For example, understanding the risk factor analysis
may help to manage a 45-year-old obese woman with sudden onset of dyspnea and
pleuritic chest pain following an orthopedic surgery for a femur fracture. This patient
has numerous risk factors for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The
physician may want to pursue angiography even if the ventilation/perfusion scan
result is low probability. Thus, the number of risk factors helps to categorize the
likelihood of a disease process.

SECTION I: HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

15

CLINICAL PEARL


When the pretest probability of a disease is high based on risk factors,
even with a negative initial test, more definitive testing may be indicated.

WHAT ARE THE COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
DISEASE PROCESS?
A clinician must understand the complications of a disease so that one may monitor
the patient. Sometimes the student has to make the diagnosis from clinical clues
and then apply his/her knowledge of the sequelae of the pathological process. For
example, the student should know that chronic hypertension may affect various end
organs, such as the brain (encephalopathy or stroke), the eyes (vascular changes),
the kidneys, and the heart. Understanding the types of consequences also helps the
clinician to be aware of the dangers to a patient. The clinician is acutely aware of
the need to monitor for the end-organ involvement and undertakes the appropriate
intervention when involvement is present.

WHAT IS THE BEST THERAPY?
To answer this question, the clinician needs to reach the correct diagnosis, assess the
severity of the condition, and weigh the situation to reach the appropriate intervention. For the student, knowing exact dosages is not as important as understanding the
best medication, route of delivery, mechanism of action, and possible complications.
It is important for the student to be able to verbalize the diagnosis and the rationale
for the therapy. A common error is for the student to “jump to a treatment,” like a
random guess, and therefore be given “right or wrong” feedback. In fact, the student’s
guess may be correct, but for the wrong reason; conversely, the answer may be a very
reasonable one, with only one small error in thinking. Instead, the student should
verbalize the steps so that feedback may be given at every reasoning point.
For example, if the question is, “What is the best therapy for a 25-year-old man
who complains of a nontender penile ulcer?” the incorrect manner of response is
for the student to blurt out “azithromycin.” Rather, the student should reason it out
in a way similar to this: “The most common cause of a nontender infectious ulcer
of the penis is syphilis. Nontender adenopathy is usually associated. Therefore, the
best treatment for this man with probable syphilis is intramuscular penicillin (but I
would want to confirm the diagnosis). His partner also needs treatment.”

CLINICAL PEARL


Therapy should be logical based on the severity of disease. Antibiotic
therapy should be tailored for specific organisms.

HOW WOULD YOU CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS?
In the scenario above, the man with a nontender penile ulcer is likely to have
syphilis. Confirmation may be achieved by serology (rapid plasma reagent [RPR]

16

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] test); however, there is a significant possibility that patients with primary syphilis may not have developed antibody
response yet, and have negative serology. Thus, confirmation of the diagnosis is
attained with dark-field microscopy. Knowing the limitations of diagnostic tests and
the manifestations of disease aids in this area.

Summary
1. There is no replacement for a careful history and physical examination.
2. There are four steps to the clinical approach to the patient: making the diagnosis,
assessing severity, treatment based on severity, and following response.
3. Assessment of pretest probability and knowledge of test characteristics are essential in the application of test results to the clinical situation.
4. There are seven questions that help to bridge the gap between the textbook and
the clinical arena.

A 56-year-old man comes to the ER complaining of chest discomfort. He describes
the discomfort as a severe, retrosternal pressure sensation that had awakened him
from sleep 3 hours earlier. He previously had been well but has a medical history of
hypercholesterolemia and a 40-pack-year history of smoking. On examination, he
appears uncomfortable and diaphoretic, with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 166/102 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Jugular venous pressure appears normal. Auscultation
of the chest reveals clear lung fields, a regular rhythm with an S4 gallop, and no
murmurs or rubs. A chest radiograph shows clear lungs and a normal cardiac
silhouette. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 1–1.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS TO CASE 1:
Myocardial Infarction, Acute
Summary: This is a 56-year-old man with risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis
(smoking and hypercholesterolemia) who has chest pain typical of cardiac ischemia,
that is, retrosternal pressure sensation. Cardiac examination reveals an S4 gallop,
which may be seen with myocardial ischemia because of relative noncompliance of
the ischemic heart, as well as hypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, which all
may represent sympathetic activation. The duration of the pain and the ECG findings suggest an acute myocardial infarction (MI).
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute ST-segment elevation MI.
• Next step in therapy: Administer aspirin and a beta-blocker, and assess whether
he is a candidate for rapid reperfusion of the myocardium, that is, treatment
with thrombolytics or percutaneous coronary intervention.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the diagnostic criteria for acute MI.
2. Know which patients should receive thrombolytics or undergo percutaneous
coronary intervention, which may reduce mortality.
3. Be familiar with the complications of MI and their treatment options.
4. Understand post-MI risk stratification and secondary prevention strategies.

Considerations
The three most important issues for this patient are: (1) the suspicion of acute MI
based on the clinical and ECG findings, (2) deciding whether the patient has indications or contraindications for thrombolytics or primary percutaneous coronary
intervention, and (3) excluding other diagnoses that might mimic acute MI but
would not benefit from or might be worsened by anticoagulation or thrombolysis
(eg, acute pericarditis, aortic dissection).

APPROACH TO:
Suspected MI
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME: Spectrum of acute cardiac ischemia ranging from unstable angina (ischemic pain at rest or at lower threshold of exertion or
new onset of chest pain) to acute MI (death of cardiac tissue), usually precipitated
by thrombus formation in a coronary artery with an atherosclerotic plaque.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

21

ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: Death of myocardial tissue because of
inadequate blood flow.
NON–ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (NSTEMI):
MI, but without ST-segment elevation as defined below. May have other ECG
changes, such as ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion. Will have elevated
cardiac biomarkers.
PCI: Percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty and/or stenting).
ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (STEMI): MI
as defined as in acute myocardial infarction, with ST-segment elevation more than
0.1 mV in two or more contiguous leads, and elevated cardiac biomarkers.
THROMBOLYTICS: Drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, and reteplase (r-PA), which act to lyse fibrin thrombi in order to restore
patency of the coronary artery when PCI is contraindicated or is not available.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
Acute coronary syndromes, which exist on a continuum ranging from unstable
angina pectoris to NSTEMI to STEMI, usually are caused by in situ thrombosis
at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery. Occasionally,
they are caused by embolic occlusion, coronary vasospasm, vasculitis, aortic root
or coronary artery dissection, or cocaine use (which promotes both vasospasm
and thrombosis). The resultant clinical syndrome is related to both the degree
of atherosclerotic stenosis in the artery and to the duration and extent of sudden
thrombotic occlusion of the artery. If the occlusion is incomplete or if the thrombus undergoes spontaneous lysis, unstable angina occurs. If the occlusion is complete and remains for more than 30 minutes, infarction occurs. In contrast, the
mechanism of chronic stable angina usually is a flow-limiting stenosis caused by
atherosclerotic plaque that causes ischemia during exercise without acute thrombosis (Table 1–1).

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR ACUTE MI
History
Chest pain is the cardinal feature of MI, even though it is not universally present.
It is of the same character as angina pectoris—described as heavy, squeezing, or
crushing—and is localized to the retrosternal area or epigastrium, sometimes with
radiation to the arm, lower jaw, or neck. In contrast to stable angina, however, it
persists for more than 30 minutes and is not relieved by rest. The pain often is
accompanied by sweating, nausea, vomiting, and/or the sense of impending doom.
In a patient older than 70 years or who is diabetic, an acute MI may be painless or
associated with only vague discomfort, but it may be heralded by the sudden onset
of dyspnea, pulmonary edema, or ventricular arrhythmias.

Physical Findings
There are no specific physical findings in a patient with an acute MI. Many patients
are anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiac auscultation may reveal an S4 gallop, reflecting
myocardial noncompliance because of ischemia; an S3 gallop, representing severe
systolic dysfunction; or a new apical systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation caused
by ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction.

Electrocardiogram
The ECG often is critical in diagnosing acute MI and guiding therapy. A series of
ECG changes reflect the evolution of the infarction (Figure 1–2).
1. The earliest changes are tall, positive, hyperacute T waves in the ischemic vascular territory.
2. This is followed by elevation of the ST segments (myocardial “injury pattern”).
3. Over hours to days, T-wave inversion frequently develops.
4. Finally, diminished R-wave amplitude or Q waves occur, representing significant
myocardial necrosis and replacement by scar tissue, and they are what one seeks
to prevent in treating the acute MI.
Sometimes when acute ischemia is limited to the subendocardium, ST-segment
depression, rather than ST-segment elevation, develops. ST-segment elevation is
typical of acute transmural ischemia, that is, a greater degree of myocardial involvement than in NSTEMI.
From the ECG we can localize the ischemia related to a vascular territory
supplied by one of the three major coronary arteries. STEMI is defined as
ST-segment elevation more than 0.1 mV in two or more contiguous leads (ie,
in the same vascular territory) and/or a new left bundle branch block (LBBB)
(which obscures usual ST-segment analysis). As a general rule, leads II, III, and
aVF correspond to the inferior surface of the heart supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA), leads V2 to V4 correspond to the anterior surface supplied by
the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and leads I, aVL, V5, and
V6 correspond to the lateral surface, supplied by the left circumflex coronary
artery (LCX).

Group, LLC.)

Cardiac Biomarkers
Certain proteins, referred to as cardiac biomarkers, are released into blood from
necrotic heart muscle after an acute MI. Creatine phosphokinase (CK) level rises
within 4 to 8 hours and returns to normal by 48 to 72 hours. Creatine phosphokinase is found in skeletal muscle and other tissues, but the creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) isoenzyme is not found in significant amounts outside of
heart muscle, so elevation of this fraction is more specific for myocardial injury.
Cardiac-specific troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac-specific troponin T (cTnT) are
more specific to heart muscle and are the preferred markers of myocardial injury.
These protein levels rise approximately from 3 to 5 hours after infarct. Cardiacspecific troponin I levels may remain elevated for 7 to 10 days and cTnT levels
for 10 to 14 days. They are very sensitive and fairly specific indicators of myocardial injury, and their levels may be elevated with even small amounts of myocardial necrosis. Generally, two sets of normal troponin levels 6 to 8 hours apart
exclude MI.

24

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

The diagnosis of acute MI is made by finding at least two of the following three
features: typical chest pain persisting for more than 30 minutes, typical ECG
findings, and elevated cardiac biomarker levels. Because of the urgency in initiating treatment, diagnosis often rests upon the clinical history and the ECG findings,
while determination of cardiac biomarker levels is pending. During the initial evaluation, one must consider and exclude other diagnoses that typically present with
chest pain but would be worsened by the anticoagulation or thrombolysis usually
used to treat acute MI. Aortic dissection often presents with unequal pulses or
blood pressures in the arms, a new murmur of aortic insufficiency, or a widened
mediastinum on chest x-ray film. Acute pericarditis often presents with chest pain
and a pericardial friction rub, but the ECG findings show diffuse ST-segment elevation rather than those limited to a vascular territory.

TREATMENT OF ACUTE MI
Once an acute MI has been diagnosed based on history, ECG, or cardiac enzyme
levels, several therapies are initiated. Because the process is caused by acute thrombosis, antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and anticoagulation with heparin are used.
To limit infarct size, beta-blockers are used to decrease myocardial oxygen demand,
and nitrates are given to increase coronary blood flow. All of these therapies appear
to reduce mortality in patients with acute MI. In addition, morphine may be given
to reduce pain and the consequent tachycardia, and patients are placed on supplemental oxygen (Figure 1–3).
Because prompt restoration of myocardial perfusion reduces mortality in STEMI, a
decision should be made as to whether the patient can either receive thrombolytics or
undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Where it is readily available, primary PCI is the preferred therapy for most patients, as it is more effective than
fibrinolysis in opening occluded arteries, and is associated with better clinical outcomes.
Individuals with ST-segment elevation MI benefit from thrombolytics, with a
lower mortality, greater preservation of myocardial function, and fewer complications; patients without ST-segment elevation do not receive the same mortality
benefit. Because myocardium can be salvaged only before it is irreversibly injured
(“time is muscle”), patients benefit maximally when the drug is given early, for
example, within 1 to 3 hours after the onset of chest pain, and the relative benefits
decline with time. Because systemic coagulopathy may develop, the major risk of
thrombolytics is bleeding, which can be potentially disastrous, for example, intracranial hemorrhage. The risk of hemorrhage is relatively constant, so the risk begins
to outweigh the benefit by 12 hours, at which time most infarctions are completed,
that is, the at-risk myocardium is dead.
Thrombolytic therapy is indicated if all of the following criteria are met:
1. Clinical complaints are consistent with ischemic-type chest pain.
2. ST-segment elevation more than 1 mm in at least two anatomically contiguous
leads.
3. There are no contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.
4. Patient is younger than 75 years (greater risk of hemorrhage if >75).

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Patients with STEMI should not receive thrombolytics if they have a clear contraindication, such as recent major surgery, active internal bleeding or suspected
aortic dissection, severe hypertension, or a prior history of a hemorrhagic stroke.
Percutaneous coronary intervention is effective in restoring perfusion in patients
with acute STEMI and has been shown in multiple trials to provide a greater survival benefit than thrombolysis and to have a lower risk for serious bleeding when
performed by experienced operators in dedicated medical centers. If patients with
an acute STEMI present within 2 to 3 hours of symptom onset and receive PCI
ideally within 90 minutes, then PCI is the recommended reperfusion therapy.
PCI also can be used in patients with a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy or
who are hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock, for whom thrombolytics offer no survival benefit. PCI is accomplished by cardiac catheterization, in which a guidewire
is inserted into the occluded coronary artery and a small balloon threaded over the
guidewire and inflated in an attempt to open the blockage and restore blood flow.
Sometimes intraluminal expandable stents are deployed, which may improve vessel
patency. Use of primary PCI may be limited by the availability of the facilities and
personnel required to perform the procedure in a timely fashion.

COMPLICATIONS OF ACUTE MI
Mortality in acute MI usually is a result of ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial pump failure and resultant cardiogenic shock.
Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT)
and ventricular fibrillation (VF), are common, especially in the first 24 hours. Historically, the majority of deaths from acute MI occurred in the first hour and were caused
by VT/VF. This has diminished in recent years with earlier and more aggressive treatment of ischemia and arrhythmias. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are
very common but generally they are not treated with antiarrhythmic agents unless they
occur very frequently, are sustained, or induce hemodynamic compromise. Sustained
VT (>30 seconds) and VF are life threatening because they prevent coordinated ventricular contraction and thus often cause pulselessness and cardiovascular collapse.
They are treated with direct current (DC) cardioversion or defibrillation, followed
by infusion of intravenous antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone. Electrolyte deficiency,
such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, which can potentiate ventricular arrhythmias, should be corrected. One benign ventricular arrhythmia that is generally not
suppressed by antiarrhythmics is the accelerated idioventricular rhythm. This is a
wide-complex escape rhythm between 60 and 110 bpm that frequently accompanies
reperfusion of the myocardium but causes no hemodynamic compromise.
Supraventricular or atrial tachyarrhythmias are much less common after acute
MI, but they can worsen ischemia and cause infarct extension as a consequence of
the rate-related increase in myocardial oxygen demand. When they cause hemodynamic instability, they also are treated with immediate DC cardioversion. Other
frequent rhythm disturbances are bradyarrhythmias. Sinus bradycardia is frequently
seen in inferior MI because the right coronary artery supplies the sinoatrial node, but
the condition generally requires no treatment unless it causes hypotension. If the
rate is slow enough to cause cardiac output and blood pressure to fall, intravenous
atropine usually is administered.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

27

Bradyarrhythmias can be caused by atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances. First-degree AV block (P-R interval prolongation) and Mobitz I seconddegree AV block (gradual prolongation of the P-R interval before a nonconducted
P wave) often are caused by AV nodal dysfunction, for example, nodal ischemia
caused by inferior MI. Patients who are symptomatic can be treated with atropine.
AV conduction disturbances can be caused by dysfunction below the AV node,
within the bundles of His, and typically produce a widened QRS complex. Examples
include Mobitz II second-degree AV block (nonconducted P waves not preceded
by PR prolongation) and third-degree AV block (complete AV dissociation with
no P-wave conduction). Third-degree AV block also can be caused by AV nodal
dysfunction. These arrhythmias are described more fully in Case 15. Conduction
disturbances caused by involvement of the bundles of His include LBBB or rightbundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior hemiblock. All of these conduction disturbances have a worse prognosis than does AV nodal dysfunction because
they are generally seen with anterior infarction in which a significant amount of
myocardium is damaged. When symptomatic bradycardias such as third-degree AV
block develop, they are best treated with external pacing or placement of a temporary transvenous pacemaker.

CARDIAC PUMP FAILURE AND CARDIOGENIC SHOCK
Cardiogenic shock in acute MI usually is the most severe form of left ventricular
(LV) pump failure. Ischemic reduction in ventricular diastolic compliance may lead
to transient pulmonary congestion, associated with elevated left-sided filling pressures. Extensive myocardial necrosis and less contracting heart muscle may cause
systolic failure and reduced cardiac output. Patients with hypotension frequently
are evaluated by pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheterization to assess hemodynamic parameters. Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed when the patient has hypotension with systolic arterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg, markedly reduced cardiac
index less than 1.8 L/min/m2, and elevated LV filling pressure (measured indirectly
with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >18 mm Hg). Clinically, such patients
appear hypotensive, with cold extremities because of peripheral vasoconstriction,
pulmonary edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure, reflecting high left- and
right-sided filling pressures. Supportive treatment includes hemodynamic monitoring,
adequate ventilation and oxygenation, and blood pressure support with vasopressors such as dobutamine and dopamine. These patients also may require mechanical assistance to augment blood pressure while providing afterload reduction, using
intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. Cardiogenic shock may require urgent revascularization with primary PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery.
Hypotension may also be seen in patients with right ventricular (RV) infarction, which is a complication of right coronary artery occlusion and inferior infarction. In this case, LV function is not impaired, but LV filling is dramatically reduced
because of the right-sided ventricular failure (the left heart can only pump out what
it receives from the right heart). These patients can be recognized clinically as hypotensive, with markedly elevated jugular venous pressure but clear lung fields and no
pulmonary edema seen radiographically (in contrast to the pulmonary edema seen

28

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

in patients with hypotension to LV failure), and the diagnosis confirmed by observation of ST-segment elevation in a right-sided ECG. In this setting, RV function
is impaired and highly dependent on adequate preload, so treatment requires support consisting of volume replacement with saline or colloid solution. Diuretics or
nitrates that might lower the preload can be disastrous in these patients by causing
hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, and thus should be avoided.
A number of mechanical problems can complicate acute MI, usually within
the first week. The most common is papillary muscle dysfunction caused by LV
ischemia or infarction, leading to mitral regurgitation that may be hemodynamically significant. This is in contrast with papillary muscle rupture, which produces a flail mitral leaflet and acute mitral regurgitation with development of
heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Development of acute heart failure and shock
in association with a new holosystolic murmur also may signify ventricular septal
rupture. Doppler echocardiography can be used to distinguish among these conditions. In all of them, stabilization of cardiogenic shock is accomplished using
afterload reduction with intravenous nitroglycerin or nitroprusside and sometimes
with aortic balloon counterpulsation until definitive, urgent, surgical repair can
be accomplished.
The most catastrophic mechanical complication is rupture of the ventricular
free wall. As blood fills the pericardium, cardiac tamponade develops rapidly, with
sudden pulselessness, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. This complication
nearly always is fatal.
Late complications that occur several weeks after an acute MI include development of a ventricular aneurysm, which should be suspected if ST-segment elevation
persists weeks after the event, as well as Dressler syndrome, an immune phenomenon characterized by pericarditis, pleuritis, and fever. Dressler syndrome may remit
and relapse, and it is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, including nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sometimes prednisone.

POST-MI RISK STRATIFICATION
The goal is to identify patients who are at high risk for subsequent cardiac events
and who might benefit from revascularization. The initial evaluation involves noninvasive testing. Submaximal exercise stress testing is generally performed in stable
patients before hospital discharge to detect residual ischemia and ventricular ectopy
and to provide a guideline for exercise in the early recovery period. Evaluation of LV
systolic function, usually with echocardiography, is routinely performed. High-risk
patients include those with impaired systolic function, large areas of ischemic myocardium on stress testing or postinfarction angina, or ventricular ectopy who might
benefit from coronary angiography to evaluate for revascularization. Percutaneous
coronary intervention can be performed to reduce anginal symptoms, and coronary artery bypass surgery should be considered for patients with multivessel
atherosclerotic stenosis and impaired systolic function because the surgery may
reduce symptoms and prolong survival. Post-STEMI patients with LV dysfunction
(LV ejection fraction <40%) are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death from
ventricular arrhythmias and may benefit from placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

29

SECONDARY PREVENTION OF ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE
Medical therapy to reduce modifiable risk factors is the cornerstone of post-MI
care. In addition to symptom relief, the major goal of medical therapy is to prevent cardiac events: fatal or nonfatal MI. By far, the most important risk factor
is smoking cessation. Quitting tobacco use can reduce the risk of fatal or nonfatal
cardiac events by more than 50%, more than any other medical or surgical therapy
available. A number of other therapies reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular
events and prolong survival in patients with coronary artery disease. Antiplatelet
agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel reduce the risk of thrombus formation,
beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand and may help suppress ventricular
arrhythmias, and cholesterol-lowering agents such as statins reduce the number of
coronary events and prolong survival. Patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD) should have a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level less than
70 mg/dL. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended for
all patients after STEMI but are most important for patients with impaired systolic
function (ejection fraction <40%), diabetes, or hypertension.

the best next step?
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.

Echocardiography
Thallium stress test
Aspirin
Coronary angiography
Coronary artery bypass

ANSWERS
1.1 B. It is appropriate to evaluate chest pain to ﬁrst rule out cardiac ischemia. One
of the most common causes of “chest pain” particularly in a younger patient is
gastroesophageal reﬂux or esophageal spasm. This patient has classic symptoms
of reﬂux esophagitis and is best treated with a proton-pump inhibitor. If the
chest pain has the characteristics of angina pectoris (substernal location, precipitated by exertion, relieved by rest or nitroglycerin), it should be investigated
with a stress test or coronary angiography.
1.2 B. Sinus bradycardia is often seen with inferior wall MI, because the right coronary artery supplies the inferior wall of the left ventricle and the sinoatrial node.
The ischemic changes in leads II, III, and aVF are in the region of the inferior
leads. Understanding which leads reﬂect which portion of the heart allows for
an understanding of the aspect of the heart that is affected. Also understanding
the area of the heart perfused by the various coronary arteries allows for correlation of associated symptoms or therapy.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

31

1.3 D. Diabetic patients can have myocardial ischemia or infarction with atypical
or absent symptoms. Clinical suspicion is required, and a liberal use of cardiac
enzymes. Troponin levels often remain elevated for 7 to 10 days and should
not be used to diagnose reinfarction, especially if the levels are trending downward. New ECG ﬁndings or rapidly rising markers such as serum myoglobin or
CK-MB can be used in this setting.
1.4 C. Aspirin is the ﬁrst agent that should be used after oxygen and nitroglycerin.
Aspirin use decreases mortality in the face of an acute coronary event. Because
initial ECGs and cardiac enzymes may be normal in acute MI, serial studies are
needed to deﬁnitively rule out MI. Clinical assessment to exclude other causes
of chest pain should be undertaken. The other answer choices are aimed toward
diagnostic tests and may be important, but the ﬁrst and foremost priority should
be to “save myocardium.”

CLINICAL PEARLS


Acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction) occur when a thrombus forms at the site of rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and acutely occludes a coronary artery.



Acute myocardial infarction is diagnosed based on the presence of at
least two of three criteria: typical symptoms, ECG findings, and cardiac
enzymes. Initial ECG and enzyme levels may be normal, so serial studies
are necessary.



Early reperfusion with PCI or thrombolytics reduces mortality and preserves ventricular function in patients who have ST-segment elevation,
have no contraindications, and receive treatment within the first 6 to
12 hours.



The goal of secondary prevention after myocardial infarction is to prevent recurrent cardiac events and death. Smoking cessation, aspirin and
clopidogrel, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins all reduce the rate
of events and reduce mortality.



After myocardial infarction, PCI can be performed to reduce ischemia and
anginal symptoms. Bypass surgery may be indicated for patients with
multivessel stenosis and impaired systolic function to reduce symptoms
and prolong survival.



The ECG can indicate the location of the ischemia or infarction: anterior
(leads V2 through V4), lateral (leads I, aVL, V5, and V6), inferior (leads II,
III, and aVF), and posterior (R waves in leads V1 and V2).



STEMI is characterized by ischemic discomfort along with ST-segment
elevation on ECG. Unstable angina and NSTEMI will not have ST-segment
elevation, but NSTEMI is diagnosed by positive cardiac biomarkers.

CASE 2
A 72-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of several weeks of worsening
exertional dyspnea. Previously, he had been able to work in his garden and mow
the lawn, but now he feels short of breath after walking 100 feet. He does not
have chest pain when he walks, although in the past he has experienced episodes
of retrosternal chest pressure with strenuous exertion. Once recently he had felt
lightheaded, as if he were about to faint while climbing a flight of stairs, but the
symptom passed after he sat down. He has been having some difficulty sleeping
at night and has to prop himself up with two pillows. Occasionally, he wakes up
at night feeling quite short of breath, which is relieved within minutes by sitting
upright and dangling his legs over the bed. His feet have become swollen, especially by the end of the day. He denies any significant medical history, takes no
medications, and prides himself on the fact that he has not seen a doctor in years.
He does not smoke or drink alcohol.
On physical examination, he is afebrile, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 115/92 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Examination
of the head and neck reveals pink mucosa without pallor, a normal thyroid gland,
and distended neck veins. Bibasilar inspiratory crackles are heard on examination.
On cardiac examination, his heart rhythm is regular with a normal S1 and a second
heart sound that splits during expiration, an S4 at the apex, a nondisplaced apical
impulse, and a late-peaking systolic murmur at the right-upper sternal border that
radiates to his carotids. The carotid upstrokes have diminished amplitude.

ANSWERS TO CASE 2:
Congestive Heart Failure due to Critical Aortic Stenosis
Summary: A 72-year-old man complains of several weeks of worsening exertional dyspnea. He has experienced angina-like chest pressure with strenuous exertion and nearsyncope while climbing a flight of stairs, and now he has symptoms of heart failure
such as orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Heart failure is also suggested
by physical signs of volume overload (pedal edema, elevated jugular venous pressure,
and crackles suggesting pulmonary edema). The cause of his heart failure may be aortic
valvular stenosis, given the late systolic murmur radiating to his carotid, the paradoxical splitting of his second heart sound, and the diminished carotid upstrokes.
• Most likely diagnosis: Congestive heart failure (CHF), possibly as a result of
aortic stenosis.
• Diagnostic test: Echocardiogram to assess the aortic valve area as well as the
left ventricular systolic function.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the causes of chronic heart failure (eg, ischemia, hypertension, valvular
disease, alcohol abuse, cocaine, and thyrotoxicosis).
2. Recognize impaired systolic function versus diastolic dysfunction.
3. Be familiar with the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure.
4. Be familiar with the evaluation of aortic stenosis and the indications for valve
replacement.

Considerations
This is an elderly patient with symptoms and signs of aortic stenosis. The valvular
disorder has progressed from previous angina and presyncopal symptoms to heart
failure, reflecting worsening severity of the stenosis and worsening prognosis for survival. This patient should undergo urgent evaluation of his aortic valve surface area
and coronary artery status to assess the need for valve replacement.

APPROACH TO:
Congestive Heart Failure
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE HEART FAILURE: Acute (hours, days) presentation of cardiac decompensation with pulmonary edema and low cardiac output, which may proceed to
cardiogenic shock.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

35

CHRONIC HEART FAILURE: Chronic (months, years) presence of cardiac dysfunction; symptoms may range from minimal to severe.
DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: Increased diastolic filling pressures caused by
impaired diastolic relaxation and decreased ventricular compliance, but with preserved ejection fraction >40% to 50%.
SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: Low cardiac output caused by impaired systolic
function (low ejection fraction <40%).
CARDIAC REMODELING: Changes to the heart due to increased cardiac loading (preload and afterload), which leads to cardiac dysfunction. Some medications
can prevent or even reverse the remodeling.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a clinical syndrome that is produced when
the heart is unable to meet the metabolic needs of the body while maintaining normal ventricular filling pressures. A series of neurohumoral responses
develop, including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and
increased sympathetic activity, which initially may be compensatory but ultimately cause further cardiac decompensation. Symptoms may be a result of
forward failure (low cardiac output or systolic dysfunction), including fatigue,
lethargy, and even hypotension, or backward failure (increased filling pressures
or diastolic dysfunction), including dyspnea, peripheral edema, and ascites. Some
patients have isolated diastolic dysfunction with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF >40%-50%), most often as a consequence of hypertension
or simply of aging. Half of patients with CHF have impaired systolic dysfunction
(LVEF <40%) with associated increased filling pressures. Some patients have
isolated right-sided heart failure (with elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatic
congestion, peripheral edema but no pulmonary edema), but more commonly
patients have left ventricular failure (with low cardiac output and pulmonary
edema) that progresses to biventricular failure. Auscultatory findings may include
an S4 (atrial gallop) or an S3 (ventricular gallop), low-pitched heart sounds that
are heard best with the bell of the stethoscope.
Heart failure is a chronic and progressive disease that can be assessed by following the patient’s exercise tolerance, such as the New York Heart Association
(NYHA) functional classification (Table 2–1). This functional classification carries prognostic significance. Individuals in class III who have low oxygen consumption during exercise have an annual mortality rate of 20%; in class IV, the rate
is 60% annually. Patients with a low ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <20%)
also have very high mortality risks. Death associated with CHF may occur from the

Table 2–1 • NYHA FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION
Class I: No limitation during ordinary physical activity
Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Develops fatigue or dyspnea with moderate exertion
Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Even light activity produces symptoms
Class IV: Symptoms at rest. Any activity causes worsening

36

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

underlying disease process, cardiogenic shock, or sudden death as a result of ventricular arrhythmias.
Although heart failure has many causes (Table 2–2), identification of the underlying treatable or reversible causes of disease is essential. For example, heart failure
related to tachycardia, alcohol consumption, or viral myocarditis may be reversible
with removal of the inciting factor. In patients with underlying multivessel atherosclerotic coronary disease and a low ejection fraction, revascularization with coronary
artery bypass grafting improves cardiac function and prolongs survival. For patients
with heart failure, appropriate investigation is guided by the history but may include
echocardiography to assess ejection fraction and valvular function, cardiac stress testing,
or coronary angiography as indicated, and, in some cases, endomyocardial biopsy.
The three major treatment goals for patients with chronic heart failure are
relief of symptoms, preventing disease progression, and a reduction in mortality
risk. The heart failure symptoms, which are mainly caused by low cardiac output and
fluid overload, usually are relieved with dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics. Because heart failure has such a substantial mortality, however, measures in an
attempt to halt or reverse disease progression are necessary. Reversible causes should
be aggressively sought and treated. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and some beta-blockers,
such as carvedilol (CAR), metoprolol, or bisoprolol, have been shown to reduce
mortality in patients with impaired systolic function and moderate to severe
symptoms. In patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition (or in black patients
in whom ACE inhibitors appear to confer less benefit), the use of hydralazine
with nitrates has been shown to decrease mortality. Aldosterone antagonists such
as spironolactone may be added to patients with NYHA class III or IV heart
failure with persistent symptoms, but patients should be monitored for hyperkalemia. Digoxin can be added to these regimens for persistent symptoms, but it
provides no survival benefit.

The mechanisms of the various agents are as follows:
Beta-blockers: Prevent and reverse adrenergically mediated intrinsic myocardial
dysfunction and remodeling.
ACE inhibitors: Reduce preload and afterload, thereby reducing right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures along with systemic vascular
resistance, and prevent remodeling. These agents are the initial drugs of choice in
treating CHF since there is a survival advantage with their use.
Nitrates and nitrites: (not as commonly used) Reduce preload and clear pulmonary
congestion.
Diuretics: Used to decrease preload, used especially acutely.
Digoxin: Acts to improve the cardiac contractility somewhat.
Aldosterone antagonists: Block the action of aldosterone.
Some devices may also be useful in reducing symptoms and mortality in patients
with heart failure. Patients with depressed ejection fraction (EF) and advanced
symptoms often have a widened QRS >120 ms, indicating dyssynchronous ventricular
contraction. Placement of a biventricular pacemaker, called cardiac resynchronization
therapy (CRT), to stimulate both ventricles to contract simultaneously can improve
symptoms and reduce mortality. Since patients with class II-III HF and depressed EF
<35% have elevated risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias,
placement of an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) should be considered.
In patients with acute decompensated heart failure, the initial treatment goals
are to stabilize the patient’s hemodynamic derangements and to identify and treat
reversible factors that may have precipitated the decompensation, such as arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia. Regarding hemodynamics, if patients appear to have
elevated LV filling pressures, they often require intravenous vasodilators such as
nitroglycerin infusion, and patients with decreased cardiac output may require inotropes such as dobutamine, and if hypotensive, they may require vasoconstrictors
such as dopamine.

Aortic Stenosis
The history and physical findings presented in the scenario suggest that this patient’s
heart failure may be a result of aortic stenosis. This is the most common symptomatic valvular abnormality in adults. The large majority of cases occur in men. The
causes of the valvular stenosis vary depending on the typical age of presentation:
stenosis in patients younger than 30 years usually is caused by a congenital bicuspid
valve; in patients 30 to 70 years old, it usually is caused by congenital stenosis or
acquired rheumatic heart disease; and in patients older than 70 years, it usually is
caused by degenerative calcific stenosis.
Typical physical findings include a narrow pulse pressure, a harsh late-peaking
systolic murmur heard best at the right-second intercostal space with radiation to
the carotid arteries, and a delayed slow-rising carotid upstroke (pulsus parvus et tardus).
The ECG often shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Doppler echocardiography
reveals a thickened abnormal valve and can define severity as assessed by the aortic
valve area and by estimating the transvalvular pressure gradient. As the valve orifice

38

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

narrows, the pressure gradient increases in an attempt to maintain cardiac output.
Severe aortic stenosis often has valve areas less than 1 cm2 (normal 3-4 cm2) and
mean pressure gradients more than 40 mm Hg.
Symptoms of aortic stenosis develop as a consequence of the resulting left
ventricular hypertrophy as well as the diminished cardiac output caused by the flowlimiting valvular stenosis. The first symptom typically is angina pectoris, that is,
retrosternal chest pain precipitated by exercise and relieved by rest. As the stenosis worsens and cardiac output falls, patients may experience syncopal episodes,
typically precipitated by exertion. Finally, because of the low cardiac output and
high diastolic filling pressures, patients develop clinically apparent heart failure
as described earlier. The prognosis for patients worsens as symptoms develop, with
mean survival with angina, syncope, or heart failure of 5 years, 3 years, and 2 years,
respectively.
Patients with severe stenosis who are symptomatic should be considered for aortic
valve replacement. Preoperative cardiac catheterization is routinely performed to
provide definitive assessment of aortic valve area and the pressure gradient, as well
as to assess the coronary arteries for significant stenosis. In patients who are not
good candidates for valve replacement, the stenotic valve can be enlarged using balloon valvuloplasty, but this will provide only temporary relief of symptoms, as there
is a high rate of restenosis. Percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement
(TAVR) is a new technique that has been developed for patients who are assessed as
having unacceptably high surgical risk, and catheter-based aortic valves have now
been approved for use in Europe and the United States.

D. Pericardial disease

ANSWERS
2.1 A. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers decrease the
risk of mortality when used to treat CHF with impaired systolic function. For
this reason, these agents are the initial choice to treat CHF. They both prevent
and can even, in some circumstances, reverse the cardiac remodeling.
2.2 B. In the United States, the most common cause of CHF associated with
impaired systolic function is ischemic cardiomyopathy due to coronary atherosclerosis.
2.3 C. The symptoms of aortic stenosis classically progress through angina, syncope,
and, ﬁnally, congestive heart failure, which has the worse prognosis for survival.
This patient’s systolic murmur is consistent with aortic stenosis. An evaluation should include echocardiography to conﬁrm the diagnosis, and then aortic
valve replacement.
2.4 A. When the ejection fraction exceeds 40%, there is likely diastolic dysfunction, with stiff ventricles. The stiff thickened ventricles do not accept blood
very readily. This patient has symptoms with mild exertion that are indicative
of functional class III. The worst class is level IV, manifested as symptoms at rest
or with minimal exertion. ACE inhibitors are important agents in patients with
diastolic dysfunction.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Congestive heart failure is a clinical syndrome that is always caused by
some underlying heart disease, most commonly ischemic cardiomyopathy as a result of atherosclerotic coronary disease, or hypertension.



Heart failure can be caused by impaired systolic function (ejection fraction
<40%) or impaired diastolic function (with preserved systolic function).



Chronic heart failure is a progressive disease with a high mortality.
A patient’s functional class, that is, his or her exercise tolerance, is the
best predictor of mortality and often guides therapy.



The primary goals of therapy are to relieve congestive symptoms with salt
restriction, diuretics, and vasodilators. Angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists can decrease
mortality.



Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and placement of an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) can reduce symptoms and improve mortality
in patients with advanced heart failure and low ejection fraction <35%.



Aortic stenosis produces progressive symptoms such as angina, exertional syncope, and heart failure, with increasingly higher risk of mortality.
Valve replacement should be considered for patients with symptoms and
severe aortic stenosis, for example, an aortic valve area less than 1 cm2.

CASE 3
A 26-year-old woman originally from Nigeria presents to the ER complaining of
sudden onset of palpitations and severe shortness of breath and coughing. She
reports that she has experienced several episodes of palpitations in the past, often
lasting a day or two, but never with dyspnea like this. She has a history of rheumatic fever at the age of 14 years. She is now 20 weeks pregnant with her first child
and takes prenatal vitamins. She denies use of any other medications, tobacco,
alcohol, or illicit drugs.
On examination, her heart rate is between 110 and 130 bpm and is irregularly
irregular, with blood pressure of 92/65 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per
minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. She appears uncomfortable,
with labored respirations. She is coughing, producing scant amounts of frothy
sputum with a pinkish tint. She has ruddy cheeks and a normal jugular venous
pressure. She has bilateral inspiratory crackles in the lower lung fields. On cardiac examination, her heart rhythm is irregularly irregular with a loud S1 and lowpitched diastolic murmur at the apex. Her apical impulse is nondisplaced. Her
uterine fundus is palpable at the umbilicus, and she has no peripheral edema. An
ECG is obtained (Figure 3–1).

ANSWERS TO CASE 3:
Atrial Fibrillation, Mitral Stenosis
Summary: This 26-year-old woman, with a history of rheumatic fever during adolescence, is now in the second trimester of pregnancy and presents with acute onset of palpitations. She is found to have atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response.
She has a diastolic rumble suggestive of mitral stenosis, which is the likely cause of her
atrial fibrillation as a result of left atrial enlargement. Because of the increased blood
volume associated with pregnancy and the onset of tachycardia and loss of atrial contraction, the atrial fibrillation has caused her to develop pulmonary edema.
• Most likely diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation caused by mitral stenosis.
• Next step: Cardiac rate control with intravenous beta-blockers.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the causes of atrial fibrillation.
2. Understand the management of acute atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.
3. Understand the rationale for anticoagulation in chronic atrial fibrillation.
4. Know the typical cardiac lesions of rheumatic heart disease and the physical findings in mitral stenosis.
5. Understand the physiologic basis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and the
special considerations in atrial fibrillation.

APPROACH TO:
Atrial Fibrillation
DEFINITIONS
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Abnormal irregular heart rhythm with chaotic generation of electrical signals in the atria of the heart.
DC CARDIOVERSION: Converting the rhythm of the heart to normal by applying direct current electrical shock.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia for which patients seek
treatment; it occurs in acute, paroxysmal, and chronic forms. During AF, disordered
atrial depolarization, often at rates exceeding 300 to 400 bpm, produces an irregular

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

43

ventricular response, depending on the number of impulses that are conducted
through the atrioventricular (AV) node. The ECG is characterized by absence of
discrete P waves and an irregularly irregular ventricular contraction. The incidence of AF increases with age, affecting 5% to 10% of patients older than 75 years.
Although many patients can maintain a normal activity level and remain essentially asymptomatic with chronic AF, there are several causes of morbidity from this
arrhythmia: it may trigger a rapid ventricular rate leading to myocardial ischemia or
exacerbation of heart failure in patients with heart disease, and thrombus formation in the noncontractile atria can lead to systemic embolization (AF is a common
cause of stroke).
Anything that causes atrial dilation or excessive sympathetic tone can lead to
AF, but the two most common causes of AF are hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis. The common causes of AF are listed in Table 3–1.
Acute AF with rapid ventricular response must be addressed quickly. The four
major goals are: (1) hemodynamic stabilization, (2) rate control, (3) anticoagulation, and (4) possible conversion to sinus rhythm. If a patient is hemodynamically
unstable (hypotensive, angina pectoris, pulmonary edema), urgent direct current
(DC) cardioversion is indicated. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, ventricular rate control can generally be achieved with intravenous beta-blockers, calcium
channel blockers, or digoxin, which slow conduction through the AV node. Once
the ventricular rate has been controlled, consideration can be given to reversing
the underlying causes (eg, thyrotoxicosis, use of adrenergic stimulants, or worsening heart failure) so that patients can undergo cardioversion to sinus rhythm. This
may occur spontaneously or after correction of underlying abnormalities, or it may
require pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. If the duration of AF exceeds
48 hours, the risk of intraatrial thrombus formation increases.
Rate control alone (ie, the use of agents to maintain a slow ventricular response
rate) is often effective in managing the symptoms of atrial fibrillation, and it has
been shown to be at least as effective as rhythm control for long-term outcomes.
If patients are unstable or persistently symptomatic, however, they may require
efforts to terminate the atrial fibrillation, and restore sinus rhythm. The most effective method of terminating AF is electrical cardioversion. After cardioversion, the
return of coordinated atrial contraction in the presence of an atrial thrombus may
result in clot embolization, leading to a cerebral infarction or other distant ischemic
event. Therefore, after 24 to 48 hours of AF, patients should receive 3 to 4 weeks of
warfarin therapy prior to and after cardioversion to reduce the risk of thromboembolic
Table 3–1 • CAUSES OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

phenomena. Alternatively, low-risk patients can undergo transesophageal echocardiography to exclude the presence of an atrial appendage thrombus prior to cardioversion. Postcardioversion anticoagulation is still required for 4 weeks, because even
though the rhythm returns to sinus, the atria do not contract normally for some
time. Pharmacologic antiarrhythmic agents, such as propafenone, sotalol, and amiodarone may be used to try to maintain sinus rhythm.
Many patients with AF cannot be cardioverted and be expected to remain in
sinus rhythm. Two important prognostic factors are left atrial dilation (atrial diameter >4.5 cm predicts failure of cardioversion) and duration of AF. The longer the
patient is in fibrillation, the more likely the patient is to stay there (“atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation”) as a consequence of electrical remodeling of the heart.
In patients with chronic AF, the management goals are rate control, using drugs to
reduce AV nodal conduction (such as digitalis or beta-blockers) as described earlier,
and anticoagulation.
Patients with chronic AF who are not anticoagulated have a 1% to 5% per year
incidence of clinically evident embolization such as stroke. Risk-assessment tools
such as the CHADS2 score (CHF, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75, Diabetes, Stroke or
transient ischemic attack history) can be used to estimate stroke risk and need for
anticoagulation. For chronic AF caused by valvular disease such as mitral stenosis,
the annual risk of stroke is substantially higher. AF that develops in patients younger
than 60 years without evidence of structural heart disease, hypertension, or other
factors for stroke is termed lone AF, and the risk of stroke is very low, so anticoagulation with warfarin is not used. Instead, aspirin may be used.
Anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke in patients with chronic AF by
two-thirds. New oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been
developed for use in atrial fibrillation, but the oral vitamin K antagonist warfarin
remains the most widely used medication for this purpose. Warfarin does not produce
a predictable dose-related response; therefore, the level of anticoagulation needs to
be monitored by regular laboratory testing using the international normalized ratio
(INR). In AF not caused by valvular disease, the goal INR is 2 to 3.
The major complication of warfarin therapy is bleeding as a consequence of
excessive anticoagulation. The risk of bleeding increases as the INR increases. If
the INR is markedly elevated (eg, INR 6-9) but there is no apparent bleeding, the
values will return to normal over several days if the warfarin is held. For higher levels
of INR (such as >9) but without bleeding, vitamin K can be administered. If clinically significant bleeding is present, warfarin toxicity can be rapidly reversed with
administration of vitamin K and fresh-frozen plasma to replace clotting factors and
provide intravascular volume replacement.

RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE
In the case presented in the scenario, the cause of this patient’s AF appears to be
mitral stenosis. Because she has a history of acute rheumatic fever, her mitral stenosis almost certainly is a result of rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease
is a late sequela of acute rheumatic fever, usually becoming symptomatic many years
after the original attack. Valvular thickening, fibrosis, and calcifications lead to valvular stenosis. The mitral valve is most frequently involved. The aortic valve may

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

45

also develop stenosis, but usually in combination with the mitral valve. The right
side of the heart is rarely involved.
Most cases of mitral stenosis in adults are secondary to rheumatic heart disease,
especially in the developing world. Congenital mitral stenosis is also commonly
seen. The physical signs of mitral stenosis are a loud S1 and an opening snap following S2. The S2-OS (mitral valve opening snap) interval narrows as the severity
of the stenosis increases. There is a low-pitched diastolic rumble after the opening
snap, heard best at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope. Because of the stenotic
valve, pressure in the left atrium is increased, leading to left atrial dilation and, ultimately, to pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can cause hemoptysis
and signs of right-sided heart failure such as peripheral edema. When AF develops,
the rapid ventricular response produces pulmonary congestion as a consequence of
shortened diastolic filling time. Rate control with intravenous beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers is essential to relief of pulmonary symptoms. In this case,
the mitral stenosis likely became symptomatic due to the patient’s pregnancy, with
increased blood volume and increased cardiac output of up to 30% to 50%.

WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE SYNDROME
Another cause of AF is the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. In patients
with this condition, AF may be life-threatening. In addition to the AV node,
patients with WPW have an accessory pathway that provides an alternate route
for electrical communication between the atria and ventricles, leading to preexcitation, that is, early ventricular depolarization that begins prior to normal AV
nodal conduction. A portion of ventricular activation occurs over the accessory
pathway, with the remaining occurring normally through the His-Purkinje system.
This preexcitation is recognized on the ECG as a delta wave, or early up-slurring
of the R wave, which both widens the QRS complex and shortens the PR interval, which represents the normal AV nodal conduction time (Figure 3–2). Some

46

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

patients with the ECG abnormalities of WPW syndrome are asymptomatic; others
have recurrent tachyarrhythmias. Most of the tachycardia is caused by paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia; one-third of patients will have AF. AF with conduction to the ventricles over an accessory pathway is a special case for two reasons.
First, when conducted through the accessory pathway, the widened QRS may look
like ventricular tachycardia, except that it will have the irregular RR interval of
AF. Second, because the AV conduction is occurring through the accessory pathway
rather than through the AV node, the ventricular rate may be very rapid, and the
usual AV nodal–blocking drugs given for ventricular rate control will not affect the
accessory pathway. In fact, beta-blockers, verapamil, and other AV nodal–blocking
agents can, paradoxically, increase the ventricular rate and should be avoided in
WPW patients with AF. If hemodynamically unstable, DC cardioversion should
be performed. If hemodynamically stable, the agent of choice is procainamide or
amiodarone, to slow conduction and convert the rhythm to sinus.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
3.1 A 28-year-old woman has been told she has rheumatic heart disease, speciﬁcally
mitral stenosis. Which of the following murmurs is most likely present?
A. Diastolic rumble at apex of the heart
B. Early diastolic decrescendo at right-upper sternal border
C. Holosystolic murmur at apex
D. Late-peaking systolic murmur at right-upper sternal border
3.2 A 48-year-old woman is noted to have atrial ﬁbrillation with a ventricular heart
rate of 140 bpm. She is feeling dizzy and dyspneic with a systolic blood pressure
of 75/48 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

47

3.4 A 59-year-old woman has been placed on warfarin (Coumadin) after being
found to have had chronic atrial ﬁbrillation. She is noted to have an INR of
5.8, is asymptomatic, and has no overt bleeding. Which of the following is the
best management for this patient?
A. Transfuse with erythrocytes.
B. Give vitamin K.
C. Give fresh-frozen plasma.
D. Hold warfarin.
3.5 A 45-year-old woman is noted to have dizziness, pounding of the chest, and
fatigue of 3 hours’ duration. On examination, she is noted to have a blood pressure (BP) of 110/70 mm Hg and heart rate of 180 bpm. She is noted on ECG to
have atrial ﬁbrillation, and a prior baseline ECG showed delta waves. The ER
physician counsels the patient regarding cardioversion, but the patient declines.
Which of the following is the best therapy for her condition?
A. Digoxin
B. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
C. Calcium channel blocker
D. Procainamide

ANSWERS
3.1 A. A diastolic rumble at the cardiac apex suggests mitral stenosis. The early
diastolic decrescendo murmur is typical of aortic regurgitation, holosystolic
murmur at the apex is typical of mitral regurgitation, and late-peaking systolic
murmur at the upper sternal border is typical of aortic stenosis.
3.2 B. This individual has signiﬁcant symptoms and hypotension caused by the
atrial ﬁbrillation and rapid ventricular rate; consequently, DC cardioversion is
the treatment of choice.
3.3 A. Clinical factors associated with a higher risk for embolic stroke include
congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75, diabetes, or prior stroke. Echocardiographic factors include dilated left atrium or the presence of an atrial
thrombus. The man in answer A has “lone atrial ﬁbrillation” with a CHADS2
score <2, and has a low risk for stroke and thus would not beneﬁt from anticoagulation.
3.4 D. The target INR with warfarin is 2 to 3; thus, 5.8 is markedly elevated.
However, because she has no overt bleeding and is asymptomatic, holding the
warfarin until the INR reaches the acceptable range is a reasonable approach
(as earlier mentioned, if INR is 6-9 and no overt bleeding, hold Coumadin).

48

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

3.5 D. This patient has atrial ﬁbrillation but with WPW as indicated by the delta
wave. In this setting, the typical agents used to treat atrial ﬁbrillation that slow
the AV node are contraindicated since the conduction through the accessory
pathway could actually accelerate. DC cardioversion is an option; however in
a hemodynamically stable patient, procainamide may be used since it will slow
propagation through the accessory pathway. Because this patient declines cardioversion, procainamide is the best choice.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common causes of atrial fibrillation are hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, pericardial or pulmonary disease, and hyperthyroidism.



Acute atrial fibrillation is treated with direct current cardioversion if the
patient is unstable. If the patient is stable, initial management is ventricular rate control with an atrioventricular nodal–blocking agent, such as
beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil.



Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation generally require long-term anticoagulation to prevent embolic strokes. An exception is “lone atrial fibrillation,” with CHADS2 score <2 in which the risk of stroke is low.



Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a ventricular preexcitation syndrome
with a delta wave, short PR interval (<0.12 seconds), and prolonged QRS
interval (>0.12 seconds). WPW is associated with paroxysmal tachycardias, including AF. AF in WPW syndrome is treated with DC cardioversion or with procainamide. AV nodal–blocking agents can, paradoxically,
increase the ventricular rate.



Auscultatory findings in mitral stenosis include a loud S1 and an opening
snap (OS) following the sound of second heart sound (S2). The interval
between S2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the stenosis.

A 37-year-old executive returns to your clinic for follow-up of recurrent upper
abdominal pain. He initially presented 3 weeks ago, complaining of an increase
in frequency and severity of burning epigastric pain, which he has experienced
occasionally for more than 2 years. Now the pain occurs three or four times per
week, usually when he has an empty stomach, and it often awakens him at night.
The pain usually is relieved within minutes by food or over-the-counter antacids,
but then recurs within 2 to 3 hours. He admitted that stress at work had recently
increased and that because of long working hours, he was drinking more caffeine
and eating a lot of take-out foods. His medical history and review of systems were
otherwise unremarkable, and, other than the antacids, he takes no medications.
His physical examination was normal, including stool guaiac that was negative
for occult blood. You advised a change in diet and started him on a proton-pump
inhibitor. His symptoms resolved completely with the diet changes and daily use
of the medication. Results of laboratory tests performed at his first visit show no
anemia, but his serum Helicobacter pylori antibody test was positive.

ANSWERS TO CASE 4:
Peptic Ulcer Disease
Summary: A 37-year-old man presents with complaints of chronic and recurrent
upper abdominal pain with characteristics suggestive of duodenal ulcer: the pain is
burning, occurs when the stomach is empty, and is relieved within minutes by food
or antacids. He does not have evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding or anemia. He
does not take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which might cause ulcer formation, but he does have serologic evidence of H pylori infection.
• Most likely diagnosis: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD).
• Next step: Triple antibiotic therapy for H pylori infection, and acid suppression.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know how to differentiate common causes of abdominal pain by historical clues.
2. Recognize clinical features of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, and features that
increase concern for gastric cancer.
3. Understand the role of H pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) in the etiology of PUD.
4. Understand the use and interpretation of tests for H pylori.

Considerations
In this patient, the symptoms are suggestive of duodenal ulcer. He does not have “alarm
symptoms,” such as weight loss, bleeding, or anemia, and his young age and chronicity of symptoms make gastric malignancy an unlikely cause for his symptoms. H pylori
commonly is associated with PUD and requires eradication to promote ulcer healing
and prevent recurrence. This patient’s symptoms might also represent nonulcer dyspepsia.

APPROACH TO:
Peptic Ulcer Disease
DEFINITIONS
DYSPEPSIA: Pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen (mainly in or
around the midline), which can be associated with fullness, early satiety, bloating,
or nausea. Dyspepsia can be intermittent or continuous, and it may or may not be
related to meals.
FUNCTIONAL (NONULCER) DYSPEPSIA: Symptoms as described for dyspepsia, persisting for at least 12 weeks but without evidence of ulcer on endoscopy.
HELICOBACTER PYLORI: A gram-negative microaerophilic bacillus that resides
within the mucus layer of the gastric mucosa and causes persistent gastric infection

and chronic inflammation. It produces a urease enzyme that splits urea, raising local
pH and allowing it to survive in the acidic environment. H pylori is associated with
50% to 60% of gastric ulcers and with 70% to 90% of duodenal ulcers.
PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE (PUD): Presence of gastric or duodenal mucosal
ulceration as demonstrated by endoscopy or by upper gastrointestinal barium study.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Upper abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints encountered in primary care practice. Many patients have benign functional disorders (ie, no specific
pathology can be identified after diagnostic testing), but others have potentially
more serious conditions such as PUD or gastric cancer. Historical clues, knowledge
of the epidemiology of diseases, and some simple laboratory assessments can help to
separate benign from serious causes of pain. However, endoscopy is often necessary
to confirm the diagnosis.
Dyspepsia refers to upper abdominal pain or discomfort that can be caused by
PUD, but it also can be produced by a number of other gastrointestinal disorders.
Gastroesophageal reflux typically produces “heartburn,” or burning epigastric or mid
chest pain, usually occurring after meals and worsening with recumbency. Biliary colic
caused by gallstones typically has acute onset of severe pain located in the right-upper
quadrant or epigastrium, usually is precipitated by meals, especially fatty foods, lasts
30 to 60 minutes with spontaneous resolution, and is more common in women. Irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion but is suggested by chronic dysmotility
symptoms (bloating, cramping) often relieved with defecation, sometimes alternating constipation and diarrhea, without weight loss or GI bleeding. If these causes are
excluded by history or other investigations, it is still difficult to clinically distinguish
the patients with PUD from those without ulcers, termed nonulcer dyspepsia.
The classic symptoms of duodenal ulcers are caused by the presence of acid without food or other buffers. Symptoms are typically produced after the stomach is
emptied but food-stimulated acid production still persists, typically 2 to 5 hours after
a meal. They may awaken patients at night, when circadian rhythms increase acid
production. The pain is typically relieved within minutes by neutralization of acid
by food or antacids (eg, calcium carbonate, aluminum-magnesium hydroxide).
Gastric ulcers, by contrast, are more variable in their presentation. Food may
actually worsen symptoms in patients with gastric ulcer, or pain might not be relieved
by antacids. In fact, many patients with gastric ulcers have no symptoms at all.
Five percent to 10% of gastric ulcers are malignant, and so should be investigated
endoscopically and biopsied to exclude malignancy.
Gastric cancers may present with pain symptoms, with dysphagia if they are
located in the cardiac region of the stomach, with persistent vomiting if they
block the pyloric channel, or with early satiety by their mass effect or infiltration
of the stomach wall. Because the incidence of gastric cancer increases with age,
patients older than 45 years who present with new-onset dyspepsia should generally undergo endoscopy. In addition, patients with alarm symptoms (eg, weight
loss, recurrent vomiting, dysphagia, evidence of GI bleeding, or iron-deficiency anemia)
should be referred for prompt endoscopy. Finally, endoscopy should be recommended for
patients whose symptoms have failed to respond to empiric therapy. When endoscopy

52

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

is undertaken, besides visualization of the ulcer, biopsy samples can be taken to
exclude the possibility of malignancy, and specimens can be obtained for urease testing or microscopic examination to prove current H pylori infection.
In younger patients with no alarm features, an acceptable strategy is to perform
a noninvasive test to detect H pylori, such as serology, urea breath test, or fecal
H pylori (Hp) antigen test. The two most commonly used tests are the urea breath
test, which provides evidence of current active infection, and H pylori antibody
tests, which provide evidence of prior infection, but will remain positive for life,
even after successful treatment. Because chronic infection with H pylori is found
in the large majority of duodenal and gastric ulcers, the standard of care is to test
for infection and, if present, to treat it with a combination antibiotic regimen for
14 days and acid suppression with a proton-pump inhibitor or H2-blocker. Several
different regimens are used, such as omeprazole plus clarithromycin, plus metronidazole or amoxicillin. A bismuth compound such as bismuth subsalicylate is also
frequently included. To improve patient compliance, some anti-H pylori regimens
are available in prepackaged formulations.
Aside from its association with PUD, H pylori is associated with the development of
gastric carcinoma and gastric mucosa–associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.
Whether treatment of H pylori infection reduces or eliminates dyspeptic symptoms in
the absence of ulcers (nonulcer dyspepsia) is uncertain. Similarly, whether treatment
of asymptomatic patients found to be H pylori positive is beneficial is unclear. In H
pylori–positive patients with dyspepsia, antibiotic treatment may be considered, but
a follow-up visit is recommended within 4 to 8 weeks. If symptoms persist or alarm
features develop, then prompt upper endoscopy is indicated.
In addition to H pylori, the other major cause of duodenal and gastric ulcers is the
use of NSAIDs. They promote ulcer formation by inhibiting gastroduodenal prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in reduced secretion of mucus and bicarbonate and
decreased mucosal blood flow. In other words, they impair local defenses against acid
damage. The risk of ulcer formation caused by NSAID use is dose dependent and
can occur within days after treatment is initiated. If ulceration occurs, the NSAID
should be discontinued if possible, and acid-suppression therapy with a proton-pump
inhibitor should be initiated.
A rare cause of ulcer is the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), a condition in
which a gastrin-producing tumor (usually pancreatic) causes acid hypersecretion, peptic ulceration, and often diarrhea. This condition should be suspected if patients have
ulcers refractory to standard medical therapy, ulcers in unusual locations (beyond the
duodenal bulb), or ulcers without a history of NSAID use or H pylori infection. About
25% of gastrinomas occur in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN I)
syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by parathyroid, pancreatic, and pituitary neoplasms. To diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the first step
is to measure a fasting gastrin level, which may be markedly elevated (>1000 pg/mL),
and then try to localize the tumor with an imaging study.
Hemorrhage is the most common severe complication of PUD and can present with hematemesis or melena. Free perforation into the abdominal cavity may

of peritonitis. If the perforation occurs adjacent to the pancreas, it may induce pancreatitis. Some patients with chronic ulcers later develop gastric outlet obstruction,

with persistent vomiting and weight loss but no abdominal distention. Perforation
and obstruction are indications for the patient to undergo surgery.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
4.1 A 42-year-old overweight but otherwise healthy woman presents with sudden
onset of right-upper abdominal colicky pain 45 minutes after a meal of fried
chicken. The pain is associated with nausea and vomiting, and any attempt to eat
since has caused increased pain. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
A. Gastric ulcer
B. Cholelithiasis
C. Duodenal ulcer
D. Acute hepatitis
4.2 Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding H pylori infection?
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.

It is more common in developed than underdeveloped countries.
It is associated with the development of colon cancer.
It is believed to be the cause of nonulcer dyspepsia.
The route of transmission is believed to be sexually transmitted.
It is believed to be a common cause of both duodenal and gastric ulcers.

4.3 A 45-year-old man was brought to the ER after vomiting bright red blood. He
has a blood pressure of 88/46 mm Hg and heart rate of 120 bpm. Which of the
following is the best next step?
A. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and preparation for a transfusion
B. Administration of a proton-pump inhibitor
C. Guaiac test of the stool
D. Treatment for H pylori
4.4 Which one of the following patients should be promptly referred for endoscopy?
A. A 65-year-old man with new onset of epigastric pain and weight loss
B. A 32-year-old patient whose symptoms are not relieved with ranitidine
C. A 29-year-old H pylori-positive patient with dyspeptic symptoms
D. A 49-year-old woman with intermittent right-upper quadrant pain following meals

ANSWERS
4.1 B. Right-upper abdominal pain of acute onset that occurs after ingestion of
a fatty meal and is associated with nausea and vomiting is most suggestive
of biliary colic as a result of gallstones. Duodenal ulcer pain is likely to be
diminished with food, and gastric ulcer pain is not likely to have acute severe
onset. Acute hepatitis is more likely to produce dull ache and tenderness.

54

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

4.2 E. Although H pylori is clearly linked to gastric and duodenal ulcers and probably
to gastric carcinoma and lymphoma, whether it is more common in patients with
nonulcer dyspepsia and whether treatment in those patients reduces symptoms
are unclear. It is more common in underdeveloped or developing countries.
4.3 A. This patient is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension and tachycardia
as a consequence of the acute blood loss. Volume resuscitation, immediately
with crystalloid or colloid solution, followed by blood transfusion, if necessary,
is the initial step to prevent irreversible shock and death. Later, after stabilization, acid suppression and H pylori treatment might be useful to heal an ulcer, if
one is present.
4.4 A. Patient in answer A has “red ﬂag” symptoms: he is older than 45 years and
has new-onset symptoms. Patient in answer B may beneﬁt from the reassurance
of a negative endoscopic examination. Patient in answer C, however, may beneﬁt from treatment of H pylori ﬁrst. Some studies indicate this approach may be
cost-saving overall. This patient could be sent for an endoscopic examination if
she does not improve following the therapy.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common causes of duodenal and gastric ulcers are Helicobacter
pylori infection and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.



Helicobacter pylori is associated with duodenal and gastric ulcers, chronic
active gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa–associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.



Treatment of peptic ulcers requires acid suppression with an H2 blocker
or proton-pump inhibitor to heal the ulcer, as well as antibiotic therapy of
Helicobacter pylori infection, if present, to prevent recurrence.



Patients with dyspepsia who have “red flag” symptoms (new dyspepsia
after the age of 45 years, weight loss, dysphagia, evidence of bleeding or
anemia) should be referred for an early endoscopic examination.



Other patients (patients with dyspepsia who do not have “red flag” symptoms) may be tested for Helicobacter pylori and treated first. Antibody
tests show evidence of infection but remain positive for life, even after
successful treatment. Urea breath tests are evidence of current infection.



Common treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection include a
14-day course of a proton-pump inhibitor in high doses along with antibiotic therapy, which may include clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or tetracycline, along with a bismuth compound.

A 65-year-old white woman is brought to the ER by her family for increasing confusion and lethargy over the past week. She was recently diagnosed with limited
stage small cell lung cancer but has not begun cancer treatment. She has not
been febrile or had any other recent illnesses. She is not taking any medications.
Her blood pressure is 136/82 mm Hg, heart rate is 84 bpm, and respiratory rate
is 14 breaths per minute and unlabored. She is afebrile. On examination, she is
an elderly appearing woman who is difficult to arouse and reacts only to painful stimuli. She is able to move her extremities without apparent motor deficits,
and her deep tendon reflexes are decreased symmetrically. The remainder of her
examination is normal, with a normal jugular venous pressure and no extremity
edema. You order some laboratory tests, which reveal the serum sodium level is
108 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) 5 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.5 mg/dL. Serum osmolality is 220 mOsm/kg,

ANSWERS TO CASE 5:
Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion
of Antidiuretic Hormone
Summary: A 65-year-old white woman with small cell lung cancer has increasing confusion and lethargy over the past week. She is afebrile and normotensive,
and she has no edema or jugular venous distention. She is lethargic but is able to
move her extremities without apparent motor deficits, and her deep tendon reflexes
are decreased symmetrically. Her serum sodium level is 108 mmol/L, potassium
3.8 mmol/L, bicarbonate 24 mEq/L, BUN 5 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.5 mg/dL; serum
osmolality is 220 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality is 400 mOsm/kg. A CT scan of the
brain shows no masses or hydrocephalus.
• Most likely diagnosis: Coma/lethargy secondary to severe hyponatremia, which
is most likely caused by a paraneoplastic syndrome of inappropriate secretion of
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
• Next therapeutic step: Treat the hyponatremia with hypertonic saline.
• Most serious complication of this therapy: Osmotic cerebral demyelination,
also referred to as central pontine myelinolysis.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the causes of hyponatremia.
2. Understand the use of laboratory testing in the diagnosis of hyponatremia.
3. Know how to treat hyponatremia, and some of the potential complications of
therapy.

Considerations
This elderly woman with small cell lung cancer presents in a stuporous state with
hypotonic hyponatremia. She appears euvolemic, as she does not have findings suggestive of either volume overload (jugular venous distention or peripheral edema)
or volume depletion. She has no focal neurologic deficits or apparent masses on
CT scan of the brain suggesting cerebral metastases. The most likely cause for her
mental status alteration is the hyponatremia. The patient does not take medications; thus, with the situation of hypotonic hyponatremia in a euvolemic state and
with inappropriately concentrated urine, the most likely etiology is inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone produced by the lung cancer. Therapy is guided by the severity of the hyponatremia and the symptoms. Because this individual is stuporous and
the sodium level is severely decreased, hypertonic saline is required with fairly rapid
partial correction. This therapy is not benign and requires monitoring in intensive
care unit (ICU). Also, the target is not correction of the sodium level to normal
(135 mmol/L) but rather to a level of safety, such as 120 to 125 mmol/L.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO:
Hyponatremia
DEFINITIONS
ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE (ADH): Also referred to as arginine vasopressin
(AVP), ADH is the posterior pituitary hormone that controls excretion of free water
and thus, indirectly, sodium concentration and serum tonicity.
OSMOLALITY: Concentration of osmotically active particles, which draw water
into a compartment; normal range is 280 to 300 mOsm/kg.
SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE SECRETION OF ANTIDIURETIC
HORMONE (SIADH): Nonphysiologic elevation of ADH levels as a consequence
of ectopic production, as in malignancy, or stimulation of excess pituitary production by various pulmonary or central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level <135 mmol/L and is, by far, the
most common electrolyte disturbance among hospitalized patients. Patients are
often asymptomatic, especially if the hyponatremia develops slowly. Depending
on the rapidity with which the hyponatremia develops, most patients do not have
symptoms until the serum sodium level is in the low 120 mmol/L range. The clinical
manifestations are related to osmotic water shifts leading to cerebral edema; thus,
the symptoms are mainly neurologic. Early symptoms include headache, nausea, and
vomiting; later symptoms may progress to lethargy, confusion, seizures, or coma.
Serum sodium concentrations are important because they almost always reflect
tonicity, the effect of extracellular fluid on cells that will cause the cells (eg, brain
cells) to swell (hypotonicity) or to shrink (hypertonicity). For purposes of this discussion, we use serum osmolality as a valid indicator of tonicity, which is almost
always true, so we use the terms interchangeably.
Hypotonic hyponatremia always occurs because there is water gain, that is,
restriction or impairment of free water excretion. If one considers that the normal
kidney capacity to excrete free water is approximately 18 to 20 L/d, it becomes
apparent that it is very difficult to overwhelm this capacity solely through excessive
water intake, as in psychogenic polydipsia. Therefore, when hyponatremia develops,
the kidney is usually holding on to free water, either pathologically, as in SIADH,
or physiologically, as an attempt to maintain effective circulating volume when
patients are significantly volume depleted. Hyponatremia can also occur in cases of
sodium loss, for example, as a consequence of diuretic use, or because of aldosterone
deficiency. However, in those cases, there is then a secondary gain of free water.
To determine the cause of the hypotonic hyponatremia, the physician must clinically assess the volume status of the patient by history and physical examination. A
useful algorithm for assessment of patients with hyponatremia is seen in Figure 5–1.
A history of vomiting, diarrhea, or other losses, such as profuse sweating, suggests
hypovolemia, as do flat neck veins, dry oral mucous membranes, and diminished
urine output. In cases of significant hypovolemia, there is a physiologic increase in

ADH in an attempt to retain free water to maintain circulating volume, even at
the expense of hypotonicity. In these cases, the excess ADH is not “inappropriate”
as in SIADH, but extremely appropriate. At this point, one can check the urinary
sodium levels. In hypovolemia, the kidney should be avidly retaining sodium, so the
urine sodium level should be less than 20 mmol/L. If the patient is hypovolemic, yet
the urine sodium level is more than 20 mmol/L, then kidneys do not have the ability
to retain sodium normally. Either kidney function is impaired by the use of diuretics,
or the kidney is lacking necessary hormonal stimulation, as in adrenal insufficiency,
or there is a primary renal problem, such as tubular damage from acute tubular
necrosis. When patients are hypovolemic, treatment of the hyponatremia requires
correction of the volume status, usually replacement with isotonic (0.9%) saline.
Hypervolemia is usually apparent as edema or elevated jugular venous pressure.
It commonly occurs as a result of congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or
the nephrotic syndrome. In these edematous disorders, there is usually a total body
excess of both sodium and water, yet arterial baroreceptors perceive hypoperfusion
or a decrease in intravascular volume, which leads to an increase in the level of
ADH and, therefore, retention of free water by the kidneys. Renal failure itself can
lead to hypotonic hyponatremia because of an inability to excrete dilute urine. In
any of these cases, the usual initial treatment of hyponatremia is administration of
diuretics to reduce excess salt and water.
Thus, hypovolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia is often apparent clinically
and often does not present a diagnostic challenge. Euvolemic hyponatremia, however, is a frequent problem that is not so easily diagnosed. Once the clinician has
diagnosed the patient with euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia, the next step is to
measure the urine osmolarity. This measurement is taken to determine whether the
kidney is actually capable of excreting the free water normally (urine osmolality
should be maximally dilute, <100 mOsm/kg) or whether the free water excretion
is impaired (urine not maximally concentrated, >150-200 mOsm/kg). If the urine
is maximally dilute, it is handling free water normally but its capacity for excretion
has been overwhelmed, as in central polydipsia. More commonly, free water excretion
is impaired and the urine is not maximally dilute as it should be. Two important diagnoses must be considered at this point: hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.
Thyroid hormone and cortisol both are permissive for free water excretion, so
their deficiency causes water retention. Cortisol deficiency in secondary adrenal
insufficiency can mimic SIADH. In contrast, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) also lack aldosterone, so they have impaired ability to
retain sodium, and often appear hypovolemic and may even present in shock.
Euvolemic hyponatremia is most commonly caused by SIADH. Nonphysiologic
nonosmotically mediated (therefore “inappropriate”) secretion can occur in the setting of pulmonary disease, CNS disease, pain, in the postoperative period, or as part of
a paraneoplastic syndrome. Because of retention of free water, patients actually have
mild (although clinically inapparent) volume expansion. Additionally, if they have a
normal dietary sodium intake, the kidneys do not retain sodium avidly. Therefore, modest natriuresis occurs so that the urine sodium level is elevated >20 mmol/L. SIADH
is a diagnosis of exclusion: the patient must be hypoosmolar but euvolemic, with
urine that is not maximally dilute (osmolality >150-200 mOsm/L), urine sodium

62

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

more than 20 mmol/L, and normal adrenal and thyroid function. Some laboratory
clues to SIADH are low BUN and low uric acid levels. Unless the patient has severe
neurologic symptoms, the usual initial treatment of SIADH is free water restriction. Patients with severe neurologic symptoms, such as seizures or coma, require
rapid partial correction of the sodium level. The treatment of choice is hypertonic
(eg, 3%) saline. When there is concern that the saline infusion might cause volume
overload, the infusion can be administered with a loop diuretic such as furosemide.
The diuretic will cause the excretion of hypotonic urine that is essentially “halfnormal saline,” so a greater portion of sodium than water will be retained, helping to
correct the serum sodium level.
When hyponatremia occurs for any reason, especially when it occurs slowly, the
brain adapts to prevent cerebral edema. Solutes leave the intracellular compartment of the brain over hours to days, so patients may have few neurologic symptoms
despite very low serum sodium levels. If the serum sodium level is corrected rapidly,
the brain does not have time to readjust, and it may shrink rapidly as it loses fluid to
the extracellular space. It is believed that this rapid shrinkage may trigger demyelination of the cerebellar and pontine neurons. This osmotic cerebral demyelination,
or central pontine myelinolysis, may cause quadriplegia, pseudobulbar palsies, a
“locked-in” syndrome, coma, or death. Demyelination can occur even when fluid
restriction is the treatment used to correct the serum sodium level. For any patient
with hyponatremia, the general rule is that chronic hyponatremia should be corrected slowly, and acutely developing hyponatremia can be corrected more quickly.
In chronic hyponatremia, the serum sodium concentration should correct no faster
than 0.5-1 mEq/h.
For patients with chronic hypervolemic hyponatremia, as in heart failure or cirrhosis, vasopressin antagonists (vaptans) are now available and are very effective in
increasing free water excretion and raising serum sodium concentrations. Therapy
with vaptans is typically initiated in the hospital with close monitoring of sodium
concentration.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
5.1 A 24-year-old man develops seizures following an emergent splenectomy after a
car accident. His serum sodium level is initially 116 mEq/L and is corrected to
120 mEq/L over the next 3 hours with hypertonic saline. Which of the following factors most likely led to his hyponatremia?
A. Elevation of serum vasopressin
B. Administration of hypertonic solutions
C. Volume depletion
D. Seizure-induced hyponatremia

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

63

5.2 A 56-year-old man presents to the doctor for the ﬁrst time complaining of
fatigue and weight loss. He has never had any health problems, but he has
smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for about 35 years. He is a day laborer and is
currently homeless and living in a shelter. His physical examination is notable
for a low to normal blood pressure, skin hyperpigmentation, and digital clubbing. He appears euvolemic. You tell him you are not sure of the problem as yet,
but you will draw some blood tests and schedule him for follow-up in a week.
The laboratory calls that night and informs you that the patient’s sodium level
is 126 mEq/L, potassium level is 6.7 mEq/L, creatinine level is normal, and
bicarbonate and chloride levels are low. Which of the following is the likely
cause of his hyponatremia given his presentation?
A. SIADH
B. Hypothyroidism
C. Gastrointestinal losses
D. Adrenal insufficiency
E. Renal insufficiency
5.3 An 83-year-old woman comes to your clinic complaining of a headache and
mild confusion. Her medical history is remarkable only for hypertension, which
is well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide. Her examination and laboratory
tests show no signs of infection, but her serum sodium level is 119 mEq/L, and
plasma osmolarity is 245 mOsm/kg. She appears to be clinically hypovolemic.
Which of the following is the best initial therapy?
A. Fluid restriction
B. Infusion of 0.9% saline
C. Infusion of 3% saline
D. Infusion of 3% saline with furosemide
5.4 A 58-year-old man has undergone a lengthy colon cancer surgery. On the ﬁrst
postoperative day, he is noted to have signiﬁcant hyponatremia with a sodium
level of 128 mEq/L. You suspect that the hyponatremia is due to the intravenous
infusion of hypotonic solution. Which of the following laboratory ﬁndings supports your diagnosis?
A. Urine sodium >20 mmol/L
B. Urine osmolality >200 mOsm/L
C. Serum osmolarity <280 mOsm/kg
D. Serum potassium >5.0 mEq/L

ANSWERS
5.1 A. In the postoperative state or in situations where the patient is in pain, the
serum vasopressin level may rise, leading to inappropriate retention of free
water, which leads to dilution of the serum. Concomitant administration of
hypotonic ﬂuids may exacerbate the situation.

64

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

5.2 D. Hyponatremia in the setting of hyperkalemia and acidosis (low bicarbonate
level) is suspicious for adrenal insufﬁciency. This patient’s examination is also
suggestive of the diagnosis, given his complaints of fatigue, weight loss, low
blood pressure, and hyperpigmentation. The diagnosis is made by a 24-hour
urine cortisol test or by measuring the response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation, showing low cortisol levels. The underlying cause
of the adrenal gland destruction in this patient probably is either tuberculosis or
malignancy.
5.3 B. Because the patient is hypovolemic, probably as a result of the use of
diuretics, volume replacement with isotonic saline is the best initial therapy.
Hyponatremia caused by thiazide diuretics can occur by several mechanisms,
including volume depletion. It is most common in elderly women.
5.4 C. In a patient with hyponatremia due to the infusion of excessive hypotonic
solution, the serum osmolarity should be low. The kidneys in responding normally should attempt to retain sodium and excrete water; hence, the urine
sodium concentration should be low, and the urine osmolality should be low.
When the infusion of hypotonic solution is used, the serum potassium level will
also be low. This is in contrast to a situation of mineralocorticoid deﬁciency
in which the sodium level will be decreased and potassium level may be elevated. Similarly, hyperaldosteronism can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia
(Conn syndrome).

CLINICAL PEARLS


Hyponatremia almost always occurs by impairment of free water excretion.



SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion. Criteria include euvolemic patient,
urine that is not maximally dilute (osmolality >150-200 mmol/L), urine
sodium >20 mmol/L, and normal adrenal and thyroid function.



Hypovolemic patients with hyponatremia should be treated with volume
replacement, typically with isotonic (0.9%) saline.



Euvolemic patients with asymptomatic hyponatremia can be treated with
fluid restriction. Patients with severe symptoms, such as coma or seizures, can be treated with hypertonic (3%) saline.



The rate of sodium correction generally should not exceed 0.5-1 mEq/h;
otherwise central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination) can
occur.

A 42-year-old man is brought to the ER by ambulance after a sudden onset of
severe retrosternal chest pain that began an hour ago while he was at home
mowing the lawn. He describes the pain as sharp, constant, and unrelated to
movement. It was not relieved by three doses of sublingual nitroglycerin administered by the paramedics while en route to the hospital. He has never had symptoms like this before. His only medical history is hypertension, for which he takes
enalapril. There is no cardiac disease in his family. He does not smoke, drink
alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He is a basketball coach at a local high school, and is
usually physically very active.
On physical examination, he is a tall man with long arms and legs who appears
uncomfortable and diaphoretic; he is lying on the stretcher with his eyes closed.
He is afebrile, with a heart rate of 118 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/64 mm Hg
in the right arm and 188/74 mm Hg in the left arm. His head and neck examination is unremarkable. His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally, and incidental
note is made of pectus excavatum. His heart rate is tachycardic and regular, with a
soft, early diastolic murmur at the right sternal border, and his pulses are bounding. His abdominal examination is benign, and neurologic examination is nonfocal. His chest x-ray shows a widened mediastinum.

ANSWERS TO CASE 6:
Aortic Dissection, Marfan Syndrome
Summary: A 42-year-old man is brought in to the ER with severe chest pain, which
was unrelieved by nitroglycerin. His blood pressure is elevated but asymmetric in
his arms, and he has a new murmur of aortic insufficiency. The chest x-ray shows a
widened mediastinum. All of these features strongly suggest aortic dissection as the
cause of his pain. He is tall with pectus excavatum and other features suggestive of
Marfan syndrome, which may be the underlying cause of his dissection.
• Most likely diagnosis: Aortic dissection.
• Next step: Administer an intravenous beta-blocker to lower blood pressure and
arterial shear stress, then perform a noninvasive imaging procedure, such as
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), computed tomography (CT) angiography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the clinical and radiographic features of aortic dissection as well as complications of dissection.
2. Know the risk factors for aortic dissection.
3. Understand the management of dissection and the indications for surgical versus
medical treatment.
4. Learn about other aortic diseases, such as abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the
role of surveillance, and indications for surgical repair.

Considerations
Most patients with chest pain seek medical attention because they are concerned
about a myocardial infarction (MI). Differentiating other conditions of chest pain
is important because some underlying conditions, such as aortic dissection, could be
worsened by the treatment of MI, for example, by anticoagulation with heparin or
use of thrombolytics. In hypertensive patients with dissection, urgent blood pressure
lowering is indicated to limit propagation of the dissection.

APPROACH TO:
Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection
DEFINITIONS
ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM (AAA): Defined as a pathologic dilation to more than 1.5 times the normal diameter of the aorta. Aneurysms can occur
anywhere in the thoracic or abdominal aorta, but the large majority occurs in the
abdomen, below the renal arteries.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

67

AORTIC DISSECTION: Tear or ulceration of the aortic intima that allows
pulsatile aortic flow to dissect longitudinally along elastic planes of the media, creating a false lumen or channel for blood flow. Sometimes referred to as a “dissecting
aneurysm,” although that term is misleading because the dissection typically produces the aneurysmal dilation rather than the reverse.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The aorta is the largest conductance vessel in the body. It receives most of the shear
forces generated by the heart with every heartbeat throughout the lifetime of an
individual. The wall of the aorta is composed of three layers: the intima, the media,
and the adventitia. These specialized layers allow the aortic wall to distend under
the great pressure created by every heartbeat. Some of this kinetic energy is stored
as potential energy, thus allowing forward flow to be maintained during the cardiac
cycle. One must consider the great tensile stress that the walls of this vessel face
when considering the pathologic processes that affect it.
Cystic degeneration of the elastic media predisposes patients to aortic dissection.
This occurs in various connective tissue disorders that cause cystic medial degeneration, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Other factors predisposing to aortic dissection are hypertension, aortic valvular abnormalities such as
aortic stenosis and congenital bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, pregnancy, and atherosclerotic disease. Aortic dissection may occur iatrogenically after
cardiac surgery or catheterization.
A dissection occurs when there is a sudden intimal tear or rupture followed by
the formation of a dissecting hematoma within the aortic media, separating the
intima from the adventitia and propagating distally. The presence of hypertension
and associated shear forces are the most important factors causing propagation of
the dissection. Aortic dissection can produce several devastating or fatal complications. It can produce an intraluminal intimal flap, which can occlude branch
arteries and cause organ ischemia or infarction. The hematoma may rupture into
the pericardial sac, causing cardiac tamponade, or into the pleural space, causing
exsanguination. It can produce severe acute aortic regurgitation leading to fulminant heart failure.
The clinical features of aortic dissection typically include a sudden onset of
ripping or tearing pain in the chest, which often radiates to the back and may
radiate to the neck or extremities as the dissection extends (Table 6–1). Differentiating the pain of dissection from the pain of myocardial ischemia or infarction is
essential because the use of anticoagulation or thrombolytics in a patient with a
dissection may be devastating. In contrast to anginal pain, which often builds over
minutes, the pain of dissection is often maximal at onset. In addition, myocardial ischemia pain usually is relieved with nitrates, whereas the pain of dissection
is not. Also, because most dissections begin very close to the aortic valve, a dissection may produce the early diastolic murmur of aortic insufficiency; if it occludes
branch arteries, it can produce dramatically different pulses and blood pressures in
the extremities. Most patients with dissection are hypertensive; if hypotension is
present, one must suspect aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, or dissection of the
subclavian artery supplying the arm where the blood pressure is being measured.

standard,” but in recent years, very sensitive noninvasive studies, such as TEE,
dynamic CT scanning, and MRI, have gained widespread use. Because of the emergent nature of the condition, the best initial study is the one that can be obtained
and interpreted quickly in the given hospital setting.
Several classification schemes describe the different types of aortic dissections.
Figure 6–1 shows the Stanford classification. Type A dissection always involves the
ascending aorta but can involve any other part. Type B dissection does not involve
the ascending aorta but can involve any other part.
Two-thirds of aortic dissections originate in the ascending aorta a few centimeters above the aortic valve. The classification system is important because it guides
therapy. Virtually all type A (proximal or ascending) dissections require urgent
surgical therapy with replacement of the involved aorta and sometimes the aortic
valve. Without surgery, the mortality rate for type A dissections is 90%. Type B
dissections do not involve the ascending aorta and typically originate in the aortic
arch distal to the left subclavian artery. Type B dissections usually are first managed
medically, and surgery usually is performed only for complications such as rupture or
ischemia of a branch artery of the aorta.
The aim of medical therapy is to prevent propagation of the dissection by reducing mean arterial pressure and the rate of rise (dP/dT) of arterial pressure, which
correlates with arterial shear forces. Intravenous vasodilators, such as sodium nitroprusside to lower blood pressure to a goal systolic pressure <120 mm Hg can be
administered, along with intravenous beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, to reduce
shear forces and try to achieve a heart rate of 60 bpm. Alternatively, one can administer intravenous labetalol, which accomplishes both tasks.
In marked contrast to the dramatic presentation of dissection of the thoracic
aorta, patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are typically asymptomatic; their AAAs often are detected by physical examination, with detection of a
midline pulsatile mass, or are noted incidentally on ultrasound or other imaging

procedure. The AAA usually is defined as a dilation of the aorta with a diameter
more than 3 cm. It is found in 1.5% to 3% of older adults but in 5% to 10% of higher
risk patients, such as those with known atherosclerotic disease. It is a degenerative
condition typically found in older men (>50 years), most commonly in smokers,
who often have atherosclerotic disease elsewhere, such as coronary artery disease
or peripheral vascular disease. It is recommended that men between the ages of
65 and 75 years who have a history of smoking should be screened for AAA with
ultrasound.
The feared complication of AAA is spontaneous rupture. If the AAA ruptures
anteriorly into the peritoneal cavity, the patient usually exsanguinates and dies
within minutes. If the AAA ruptures posteriorly and the bleeding is confined to
the retroperitoneum, the peritoneum can produce local tamponade, and the patient
presents with severe lower back or midabdominal pain. Overall, the mortality rate
of ruptured AAA is 80%, with 50% of patients dead before they reach the hospital.
The risk of rupture is related to the size of the aneurysm: the annual rate of
rupture is low if the aneurysm is smaller than 5 cm but is at least 10% to 20% for
6-cm aneurysms. The risk of rupture must be weighed against the surgical risk of elective repair, which traditionally required excision of the diseased aorta and replacement with a Dacron graft, although endovascular treatment with placement of an
aortic stent graft is now commonly performed. Operative repair of AAAs is indicated for aneurysms 5.5 cm or greater in diameter or those expanding more than

0.5 cm per year, or if the aneurysm is symptomatic. As for surveillance of AAAs,
the current recommendations are that patients undergo some sort of imaging of the
aneurysm (MRI, CT scan, or ultrasound study) at 3- to 12-month intervals, depending on the risk of rupture.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
6.1 A 59-year-old man complains of severe chest pain that radiates to his back. His
brachial pulses appear unequal. He appears hemodynamically stable. On chest
radiography, he has a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the best
next step?
A. Initiate thrombolytic therapy.
B. Obtain CT of chest with intravenous contrast.
C. Initiate aspirin and heparin.
D. Measure serial cardiac enzyme levels.
6.2 A 45-year-old woman with new-onset aortic regurgitation is found to have aortic dissection of the ascending aorta and aortic arch by echocardiography. She
is relatively asymptomatic. Which of the following is the best management?
A. Oral atenolol therapy and monitor the dissection
B. Angioplasty
C. Surgical correction
D. Oral warfarin (Coumadin) therapy
6.3 A healthy 75-year-old man undergoing an ultrasound examination for suspected
gallbladder disease is found incidentally to have a 4.5-cm abdominal aneurysm
of the aorta. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?
A. Surgical repair of the aneurysm
B. Serial ultrasound examinations every 6 months
C. Urgent MRI
D. Beta-agonist therapy
6.4 A 45-year-old man is concerned because his father died of a ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm. On evaluation, he is found to have a bicuspid aortic valve.
Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding his condition?
A. He is at risk for an aortic aneurysm of the ascending aorta.
B. He is at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
C. He is not at increased risk for aortic aneurysms.
D. He should have surgical correction of the aortic valve.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

71

ANSWERS
6.1 B. A CT scan of the chest is a quick imaging test to conﬁrm the aortic dissection. Thrombolytic therapy or anticoagulation can worsen the process.
6.2 C. Surgery is urgently required in the event of aortic root or other proximal
(type A) dissections. Unrecognized and hence untreated aortic dissection can
quickly lead to exsanguination and death.
6.3 B. When an AAA reaches 5.5 cm or greater, surgery usually is indicated because
the risk of rupture is increased. For asymptomatic aneurysms smaller than 5 cm,
the 5-year risk of rupture is less than 1% to 2%, so serial noninvasive monitoring is an alternative strategy.
6.4 C. Risk factors for AAA include smoking, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. A bicuspid aortic valve is usually asymptomatic and does not place
the patient at risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms, although it is a risk factor for
the development of aortic stenosis or dissection.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Hypertension is an underlying factor that predisposes to aortic dissection
in the majority of cases. Other patients at risk include those with Marfan
syndrome, patients with congenital aortic anomalies, or otherwise normal women in the third trimester of pregnancy.



Urgent surgical repair is indicated for type A (ascending) aortic dissections. Uncomplicated, stable, type B (transverse or descending) aortic
dissections can be managed medically.



Medical therapy for aortic dissection includes intravenous beta-blockers
such as metoprolol or labetalol to lower cardiac contractility, arterial pressure, and shear stress, thus limiting propagation of the dissection.



Men between the ages of 65 and 75 years with a smoking history should
be screened for AAA by ultrasound.



Aortic dissection may be complicated by rupture, occlusion of any branch
artery of the aorta, or retrograde dissection with hemopericardium and
cardiac tamponade.



The risk of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases with size.
Aneurysms larger than 5.5 cm should undergo elective surgical repair;
those smaller than 5 cm can be monitored with serial ultrasonography or
other imaging procedure.



Chest pain in the presence of a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray
should suggest aortic dissection.

CASE 7
A 32-year-old man infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), whose last
CD4 count is unknown, presents to the ER with a fever of 102.5°F. He was diagnosed
with HIV infection approximately 3 years ago when he presented to his doctor with
oral thrush. He was offered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and stayed
on this regimen until approximately 10 months ago, when he lost his job and insurance and could no longer pay for the drugs and discontinued all treatment. He has
felt more “run down” recently. For the last 2 to 3 weeks he has had fever and a nonproductive cough, and he has felt short of breath with mild exertion, such as when
cleaning his house. On examination his blood pressure is 134/82 mm Hg, pulse
is 110 bpm, and respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation on
room air at rest is 89% but drops to 80% when he walks 100 feet, and his breathing
becomes quite labored. His lungs are clear to auscultation, but white patches cover
his buccal mucosa. Otherwise, his examination is unremarkable. Laboratory testing
shows a leukocyte count of 2800 cells/mm3. Serum lactic (acid) dehydrogenase (LDH)
is 540 U/L (normal 140-280 U/L). His chest radiograph is shown in Figure 7–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 7:
HIV and Pneumocystis Pneumonia
Summary: A 32-year-old man with known HIV infection but unknown CD4 count
presents with subacute onset of fever, dry cough, and gradually worsening dyspnea.
He is not undergoing any antiretroviral therapy or taking prophylactic medications. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate is seen on chest x-ray, and he is
tachypneic and hypoxemic. The presence of oral thrush suggests that he is immunosuppressed. His leukocyte count is decreased (<3500 cells/mm3), and his LDH
level is elevated.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
probable Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).a
• Next step: The next step is to stabilize the patient, who is tachypneic and
hypoxic but is in only mild distress and is hemodynamically stable. Therefore,
there is time to further evaluate him. An arterial blood gas measurement can be
obtained to quantify his degree of hypoxemia, as it will impact the treatment.
• Other diagnoses to be considered: In patients with AIDS, other opportunistic
infections must be considered. Other respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis
(TB), atypical mycobacteria, cryptococcosis, and disseminated histoplasmosis,
a

As of 2002, the organism has been renamed Pneumocystis jirovecii. The abbreviation PCP remains for
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

must be considered. In addition, HIV-infected patients are susceptible to the
usual causes of community-acquired pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae,
mycoplasma, and viruses such as influenza.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the natural history of HIV infection.
2. Know the types of opportunistic infections that typically affect HIV-infected
patients at various levels of immunocompromise.
3. Be familiar with respiratory infections in patients with AIDS.
4. Be familiar with indications for antiretroviral therapy and for prophylactic medications against opportunistic infections.

Considerations
This individual with HIV, currently not taking antiviral medications or any antibiotic prophylaxis, presents with subacute dyspnea and cough. His lack of sputum production and elevated LDH level are suggestive of PCP. The presence of oral thrush
suggests a CD4 count less than 250. If the CD4 count is less than 200 cells/mm3,
then PCP seems the most likely explanation for his symptoms and chest x-ray findings. Obtaining an arterial blood gas measurement will provide information about
prognosis and help guide therapy. Arterial oxygen concentration less than 70 mm Hg
or alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a) more than 35 mm Hg suggests a worse prognosis
and corticosteroids may be helpful, followed by treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).

APPROACH TO:
HIV Infections
DEFINITIONS
PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII (Formerly Pneumocystis carinii): A unicellular
fungus that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, especially those
with HIV and CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3.
AIDS: A CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 or diagnosis of an AIDS-defining
illness in a patient who is HIV positive.

CLINICAL APPROACH
When evaluating a patient with HIV and suspected opportunistic infection, it
is essential to know or estimate the patient’s level of immunodeficiency. This is
reflected by the CD4 (T4) cell count. Normal CD4 levels in adults range from 600 to
1500 cells/mm3. As levels decline to less than 500 cells/mm3, immune function is
compromised, and patients become increasingly susceptible to unusual infections or
malignancies.

76

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Approximately 30% of patients first infected with HIV will develop an acute
HIV syndrome characterized by sudden onset of a mononucleosis-like illness with
fever, headaches, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and sometimes a macular rash.
The rest of the patients remain asymptomatic and have a clinically latent period of
8 to 10 years, on average, before the clinical manifestations of immunocompromise
appear. As CD4 levels decline, various opportunistic infections appear. At CD4
levels less than 500, patients are susceptible to infections, such as recurrent pneumonias, tuberculosis (TB), vaginal candidiasis, and herpes zoster. At CD4 levels less
than 200, patients are significantly immunocompromised and develop infections
with organisms that rarely cause significant illness in immunocompetent hosts, such
as Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly Pneumocystis carinii), toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, or cryptosporidiosis. At CD4 levels less than 50, patients are
severely immunocompromised and are susceptible to disseminated infection with
histoplasmosis and Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare complex (MAC) as well as
development of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, colitis, and esophagitis, or primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) has published a list of clinical conditions that define progression to AIDS in a patient who is HIV positive, so-called AIDS-defining conditions (see Table 7–1).

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic infection affecting AIDS patients but often is very difficult to diagnose. The clinical
presentation ranges from fever without respiratory symptoms, to mild, persistent,
dry cough, to significant hypoxemia and respiratory compromise. In addition, the
radiographic presentation can be highly variable, ranging from a near-normal chest
film to a diffuse bilateral infiltrate, to large cysts or blebs (but almost never causes
pleural effusion). The blebs can rupture, causing spontaneous pneumothorax. PCP
often is suspected when patients present with subacute onset of fever and respiratory symptoms, but the diagnosis should usually be confirmed. Definitive diagnosis
can be established by use of Giemsa or silver stain to visualize the organism but
usually requires induction of sputum using aerosolized hypertonic saline to induce
cough or bronchoalveolar lavage to obtain a diagnostic specimen. PCR to detect
Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA sequences may also be performed. Elevated LDH level
often is used as an indirect marker for PCP, although it is nonspecific and may also
be elevated in disseminated histoplasmosis or lymphoma. It is useful as a negative
predictor because patients with an LDH level less than 220 IU/L are very unlikely
to have PCP. Similarly, if patients have a CD4 count more than 250 cells/mm3 or if
they were taking PCP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX, the diagnosis of PCP should be
considered highly unlikely.
The level of oxygenation of PCP patients by arterial blood gas is useful because it
may affect prognosis and therapy. Patients with arterial PO2 less than 70 mm Hg or
A-a gradient less than 35 mm Hg have significant disease and have an improved
prognosis if prednisone is given in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy. After
prednisone is given to patients with hypoxia, the usual treatment for PCP is TMPSMX. Patients who are allergic to sulfa can be treated with alternative regimens,
including pentamidine or clindamycin with primaquine.
Many other respiratory infections are possible and should be considered in
patients with AIDS. Diagnosis can be suggested by chest radiography. Diffuse interstitial infiltrates are seen with PCP, disseminated histoplasmosis, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium kansasii. Patchy infiltrates and pleural-based infiltrates can be seen with TB and cryptococcal lung disease. Cavitary lesions can be
seen with TB, PCP, and coccidiomycosis. Clinical history should also be considered.
Since the most common causes of bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients are the
same organisms that cause pneumonia in immunocompetent hosts, acute onset
of fever and productive cough, with a pulmonary infiltrate, is most consistent with
community-acquired pneumonia. A more indolent or chronic history of cough and
weight loss, especially in a patient who has a high-risk background (prison, homeless, immigrant), should raise the question of tuberculosis. In patients with CD4
count more than 200 cells/mm3, the radiographic appearance of TB is likely to be
similar to that of other hosts, for example, bilateral apical infiltrate with cavitation;
in those with CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3, the radiographic appearance is
extremely variable. Because TB involves both the alveoli and the pulmonary circulation, patients with TB rarely are hypoxic with minimal infiltrate on chest x-ray
(although this is relatively common in PCP). Patients with suspected pulmonary
TB should be placed in respiratory isolation until it is assured they are not spreading airborne tuberculous infection. A negative purified protein derivative (PPD)

78

(tuberculin skin test) does not rule out tuberculosis in an immunocompromised
host. Diagnosis and treatment of TB is discussed in Case 31, but it should be noted
that in HIV, TB is more likely to spread hematogenously and produce extrapulmonary manifestations. In HIV patients, M kansasii can cause pulmonary disease and
radiographic findings identical to those of M tuberculosis.
Several other opportunistic infections in AIDS deserve mention. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common CNS mass lesions in AIDS patients. It typically
presents with headache, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits, and it is seen on CT or
MRI scan, usually as multiple enhancing lesions, often located in the basal ganglia.
Presumptive diagnosis often is made based on the radiologic appearance, supported
by serologic evidence of infection. The major alternative diagnosis for CNS mass
lesions is CNS lymphoma. This diagnosis is considered if there is a single mass
lesion or if the lesions do not regress after 2 weeks of empiric toxoplasmosis therapy
with sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine. If this is the case, historically, the next diagnostic step has been stereotactic brain biopsy. However, recent evidence indicates
that examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for Epstein-Barr virus DNA
is a useful strategy because it is present in more than 90% of patients with CNS
lymphoma.
Another CNS complication that requires a high index of suspicion is cryptococcal meningitis. It is a chronic indolent infection, which often presents with vague
symptoms of mood or personality changes, headaches, or visual disturbance. If the
diagnosis is considered, one can screen for evidence of cryptococcal infection by
a serum cryptococcal antigen or perform a lumbar puncture. The CSF frequently
shows a lack of inflammatory response (ie, normal white blood cell [WBC] count),
but the patient often presents with elevated intracranial pressures. Diagnosis can
be confirmed by demonstrating the yeast by India ink stain, by fungal culture, or
by measuring the level of cryptococcal antigen from CSF. Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis requires induction with intravenous amphotericin B plus flucytosine,
then chronic suppression with oral fluconazole. At times, frequent lumbar punctures
with removal of large volumes of CSF are required to treat the intracranial hypertension, and CSF shunts may be required.
At very low CD4 counts (<50 cells/mm3), patients with AIDS are also susceptible to CMV infections. This can be manifested as viremia with persistent fever and
constitutional symptoms, retinitis that can lead to blindness, esophagitis that can
cause severe odynophagia, colitis, and necrotizing adrenalitis, which occasionally
destroys sufficient adrenal tissue to produce clinical adrenal insufficiency. Therapy
for severe CMV infections includes intravenous ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir.
Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare complex (MAC) is one of the most frequent opportunistic infections occurring in patients with very low CD4 counts.
The most frequent presentations are disseminated infection with persistent fevers,
weight loss, and constitutional symptoms, as well as gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms
such as abdominal pain or chronic watery diarrhea. It often is diagnosed by obtaining a mycobacterial blood culture. Treatment with clarithromycin, ethambutol, and
rifabutin is required for weeks in an attempt to clear the bacteremia.
Because of the frequency and severity of common opportunistic infections,
antimicrobial prophylaxis is routinely given as a patient’s immune status declines.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

79

With CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3, PCP prophylaxis should be given as
one double-strength tablet of TMP-SMX daily. When counts fall to less than
100 cells/mm3 and patients have a positive Toxoplasma serology, toxoplasmosis can
be prevented with daily dosing of TMP-SMX. If CD4 levels are less than 50 cells/
mm3, MAC prophylaxis consists of clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily or azithromycin 1200 mg weekly. Prophylaxis can be discontinued if HAART is started and the
patient’s CD4 levels recover.
HAART includes a combination at least three drugs often consisting of two
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, along with either a nonnucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor. HAART is very potent and
has dramatically revolutionized the treatment of HIV patients, producing suppression of viral replication and allowing a patient’s CD4 count to recover. Initiation
of antiretrovital therapy is usually indicated in any of the following circumstances:
(1) acute HIV infection, (2) asymptomatic infection with CD4 <500, (3) pregnancy,
or (4) symptomatic patient regardless of CD4 count.
However, initiation of HAART likely is not practical in acutely ill patients
because the medications are not easy to take and often cause side effects that can be
confused with the underlying disease process. Additionally, within 1 to 2 weeks of
starting HAART, improvement in the immune system can actually cause worsening
symptoms as a result of host responses, termed the “immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome” (IRIS). Therefore, it may be better to wait until the acute illness
has resolved and to initiate antiretroviral therapy after the patient has recovered,
in consultation with an infectious diseases expert, when reliable follow-up has been
assured.

7.3 A 44-year-old woman infected with HIV is noted to have a CD4 count of
180 cells/mm3. Which of the following is recommended as a useful prophylactic
agent in this patient at this point?
A. Fluconazole
B. Azithromycin
C. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
D. Ganciclovir
7.4 A 36-year-old woman with HIV is admitted with new-onset seizures. The CT

the following is the best therapy for the likely condition?
A. Rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol
B. Ganciclovir
C. Penicillin
D. Sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine

ANSWERS
7.1 A. The fever, dry cough, and dyspnea are consistent with PCP, which is diagnosed by silver stain of the sputum, which often requires bronchoalveolar lavage
to obtain.
7.2 D. The same organisms that cause community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent individuals are causative in HIV patients. Additionally, HIV patients
may be more susceptible to encapsulated organisms such as S pneumoniae and
H inﬂuenzae.
7.3 C. When the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/mm3, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) prophylaxis is generally initiated to prevent PCP.
Prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare complex usually is
started when the CD4 count is less than 50 cells/mm3, and toxoplasmosis prophylaxis usually is started when the CD4 count is less than 100 cells/mm3.
7.4 D. The most common cause of a mass lesion of the brain in an HIV patient is
toxoplasmosis, which is treated with sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Pneumocystis pneumonia typically has a subacute presentation with fever
and a dry cough, almost always in patients with a CD4 count less than
200 cells/mm3. Patients may have normal chest x-ray or a faint bilateral
infiltrate, and typically have an elevated serum lactic acid dehydrogenase
level.



Pulmonary tuberculosis should always be considered in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with respiratory symptoms and
suggestive history; its radiographic presentation may be atypical.



The most common causes of bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients are
the same as those in immunocompetent patients, that is, communityacquired organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.



In patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) prophylaxis is effective in preventing Pneumocystis pneumonia and in preventing toxoplasmosis when the CD4 count
is less than 100 cells/mm3. When the CD4 is less than 50 cells/mm3,
clarithromycin or azithromycin can prevent Mycobacterium avium–
intracellulare complex.



Highly active antiretroviral therapy is effective in reducing viral replication, increasing CD4 counts, and restoring immunocompetence but generally should not be initiated during an acute illness due to IRIS.

CASE 8
A 58-year-old man presents to the ER complaining of severe pain in his left calf
and foot that woke him from sleep. He has a history of chronic stable angina,
hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, for which he takes aspirin, atenolol, and
simvastatin. He has experienced pain in both calves and feet with walking for
several years, and the pain has gradually progressed so that he can now only walk
100 feet before he has to stop because of pain. He occasionally has experienced
mild pain in his feet at night, but the pain usually gets better when he sits up
and hangs his feet off the bed. This time, the pain was more severe and did not
improve, and he now feels like the foot is numb and he cannot move his toes.
On physical examination, he is afebrile, with heart rate 72 bpm and blood pressure 125/74 mm Hg. Head and neck examination are significant for a right carotid
bruit. His chest is clear to auscultation; his heart rhythm is regular with a nondisplaced apical impulse, an S4 gallop, and no murmurs. His abdomen is benign,
with no tenderness or masses. He has bilateral femoral bruits, and palpable femoral and popliteal pulses bilaterally. His pedal pulses are diminished; they are present on the right but absent on the left. The left distal leg and foot are pale and cold
to touch, with very slow capillary refill.

vascular disease, including acute limb ischemia.
2. Know the evaluation and medical management of peripheral vascular disease.
3. Understand the indications for extremity revascularization.

Considerations
This patient has diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease, including coronary artery
disease, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease. His history of calf pain
with walking, but resolution with rest, is classic for claudication. Recently, the
perfusion of his left leg likely was worsening, requiring his waking up and dangling
his leg to enable blood flow and to help the pain. Rest pain is a warning sign of
possible critical limb vascular insufficiency. The patient complains of sudden onset
of pain, pallor, and pulselessness, indicative of acute arterial occlusion. His limb
ischemia may result from acute arterial occlusion caused by an embolus, usually arising from a dislodged thrombus from the heart, or from the aorta or a large proximal
artery such as the iliac. Depending on the level of occlusion, the patient may require
urgent arterial thromboembolectomy. MR or CT angiography, or possibly a conventional arteriogram would be needed to first determine the arterial anatomy and
define the best mode of revascularization.

APPROACH TO:
Peripheral Vascular Disease
DEFINITIONS
ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX (ABI): Ratio of ankle to brachial systolic blood
pressure, determined using Doppler ultrasound flow.
CLAUDICATION: Pain, ache, or cramp in muscles that increases with walking or
leg exertion in a predictable manner and resolves with rest.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

85

CLINICAL APPROACH
Although atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, clinicians often focus on the coronary
circulation and are less attentive to the extremities. Yet atherosclerotic peripheral
arterial disease (PAD) is estimated to affect up to 16% of Americans (55 years and
older) and may exist without clinically recognized coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, PAD confers the same risk of cardiovascular death as in persons
with a prior myocardial infarction or stroke. The most important risk factors for
PAD are cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
elevated homocysteine levels also play significant roles.

Diagnosis
The most common symptom associated with chronic arterial insufficiency caused
by PAD is intermittent claudication, characterized by pain, ache, a sense of fatigue,
or other discomfort that occurs in one or both legs during exercise, such as walking,
and is relieved with rest. It is ischemic pain and occurs distal to the site of the arterial stenosis, most commonly in the calves. The symptoms often are progressive and
may severely limit a patient’s activities and reduce the patient’s functional status.
An individual with proximal stenosis, such as aortoiliac disease, may complain of
exertional pain in the buttocks and thighs. Severe occlusion may produce rest pain,
which often occurs at night and may be relieved by sitting up and dangling the legs,
using gravity to assist blood flow to the feet.
On physical examination, palpation of the peripheral pulses may be diminished
or absent below the level of occlusion; bruits may indicate accelerated blood flow
velocity and turbulence at the sites of stenosis. Bruits may be heard in the abdomen
with aortoiliac stenosis and in the groin with femoral artery stenosis. Elevation of
the feet above the level of the heart in the supine patient often induces pallor in the
soles. If the legs are then placed in the dependent position, they frequently develop
rubor as a result of reactive hyperemia. Chronic arterial insufficiency may cause hair
loss on the legs and feet, thickened and brittle toenails, and shiny atrophic skin.
Severe ischemia may produce ulcers or gangrene.
When PAD is suspected, the test most commonly used to evaluate for arterial insufficiency is the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Systolic blood pressures are measured by
Doppler ultrasonography in each arm and in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
arteries in each ankle. Normally, blood pressures in the large arteries of the legs and
arms are similar. In fact, blood pressures in the legs often are higher than in the arms
because of an artifact of measurement, so the normal ratio of ankle to brachial pressures is more than 1. Patients with claudication typically have ABI values ranging from
0.41 to 0.90, and those with critical leg ischemia have ABI values less than or equal
to 0.40. Further evaluation with exercise treadmill testing can clarify the diagnosis
when symptoms are equivocal, can allow for assessment of functional limitations (eg,
maximal walking distance), and can evaluate for concomitant coronary artery disease.

Management
The goals of therapy include reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,
improvement in quality of life by decreasing symptoms of claudication and eliminating rest pain, and preservation of limb viability.

86

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

The first step in managing patients with PAD is risk factor modification. Because
of the likelihood of coexisting atherosclerotic vascular disease such as coronary
artery disease, patients with symptomatic PAD have an estimated mortality rate of
50% in 10 years, most often as a consequence of cardiovascular events. Smoking
is, by far, the single most important risk factor impacting both claudication symptoms and overall cardiovascular mortality. Besides slowing the progression to critical
leg ischemia, tobacco cessation reduces the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial
infarction by as much as 50%, more than any other medical or surgical intervention. In addition, treatment of hypercholesterolemia, control of hypertension
and diabetes, and use of antiplatelet agents such as aspirin or clopidogrel all have
been shown to improve cardiovascular health and may have an effect on peripheral
arterial circulation. Carefully supervised exercise programs can improve muscle
strength and prolong walking distance by promoting the development of collateral
blood flow.
Specific medications for improving claudication symptoms have been used,
with some benefit. Pentoxifylline, a substituted xanthine derivative that increases
erythrocyte elasticity, has been reported to decrease blood viscosity, thus allowing
improved blood flow to the microcirculation; however, results from clinical trials
are conflicting, and the benefit of pentoxifylline, if present, appears small. A newer
agent, cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with vasodilatory and antiplatelet
properties, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
treatment of claudication. It has been shown in randomized controlled trials to
improve maximal walking distance. Figure 8–1 shows an algorithm for management
of PAD.
Patients with critical leg ischemia, defined as ABI less than 0.40, severe or
disabling claudication, rest pain, or nonhealing ulcers, should be evaluated for
a revascularization procedure. This can be accomplished by percutaneous angioplasty, with or without placement of intraarterial stents, or surgical bypass grafting.
Angiography (either conventional or magnetic resonance arteriography) should be
performed to define the flow-limiting lesions prior to any vascular procedure. Ideal
candidates for arterial revascularization are those with discrete stenosis of large vessels; diffuse atherosclerotic and small-vessel disease respond poorly.
Less common causes of chronic peripheral arterial insufficiency include thromboangiitis obliterans, or Buerger disease, which is an inflammatory condition of
small- and medium-size arteries that may affect the upper or lower extremities and is
found almost exclusively in smokers, especially males younger than 40 years. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a hyperplastic disorder affecting medium and small arteries
that usually occurs in women. Generally, the renal or carotid arteries are involved,
but when the arteries to the limbs are affected, the clinical symptoms are identical to those of atherosclerotic PAD. Takayasu arteritis is an inflammatory condition, seen primarily in younger women, that usually affects branches of the aorta,
most commonly the subclavian arteries, and causes arm claudication and Raynaud
phenomenon, along with constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss.
Patients with chronic peripheral arterial insufficiency who present with sudden unremitting pain may have an acute arterial occlusion, most commonly the
result of embolism or in situ thrombosis. The heart is the most common source

of emboli; conditions that may cause cardiogenic emboli include atrial fibrillation,
dilated cardiomyopathy, and endocarditis. Artery-to-artery embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the aorta or large vessels may occur spontaneously or, more
often, after an intravascular procedure, such as arterial catheterization. Emboli tend
to lodge at the bifurcation of two vessels, most often in the femoral, iliac, popliteal,
or tibioperoneal arteries. Arterial thrombosis may occur in atherosclerotic vessels at
the site of stenosis or in an area of aneurysmal dilation, which may also complicate
atherosclerotic disease.
Patients with acute arterial occlusion may present with a number of signs, which can
be remembered as “six Ps”: pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesias, poikilothermia
(coolness), and paralysis. The first five signs occur fairly quickly with acute ischemia;
paralysis will develop if the arterial occlusion is severe and persistent.
Rapid restoration of arterial supply is mandatory in patients with an acute
arterial occlusion that threatens limb viability. Initial management includes anticoagulation with heparin to prevent propagation of the thrombus. The affected
limb should be placed below the horizontal plane without any pressure applied to
it. Conventional arteriography usually is indicated to identify the location of the
occlusion and to evaluate potential methods of revascularization. Surgical removal

of an embolus or arterial bypass may be performed, particularly if a large proximal
artery is occluded. A balloon catheter may also be attempted to remove the clot.
Alternatively, a catheter can be used to deliver intraarterial thrombolytic therapy
directly into the thrombus. In comparison with systemic fibrinolytic therapy, localized infusion is associated with fewer bleeding complications.

8.5 A 67-year-old woman is noted to have signiﬁcant peripheral vascular disease.
She is evaluated by the cardiovascular surgeon but not felt to be a surgical candidate. Which of the following conditions is likely to be present in this patient?
A. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease
B. Leg pain at rest
C. Symptoms that do not improve with pharmacologic management
D. Nonhealing ulcers of the ankle

ANSWERS
8.1 D. Tobacco cessation is the most important intervention to improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients, such as those with PAD,
and to improve claudication symptoms. Cilostazol may help with claudication
symptoms but will not affect cardiovascular mortality. Aspirin, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are important adjuncts for riskfactor modiﬁcation and for relief of symptoms, but their beneﬁts pale in comparison to smoking cessation.
8.2 C. Thromboangiitis obliterans, or Buerger disease, is a disease of young male
smokers and may cause symptoms of chronic arterial insufﬁciency in either legs
or arms.
8.3 D. Takayasu aortitis is associated with symptoms of inﬂammation such as fever,
and most often affects the subclavian arteries, producing stenotic lesions that
may cause unequal blood pressures, diminished pulses, and ischemic pain in the
affected limbs.
8.4 A. Embolism of cholesterol and other atherosclerotic debris from the aorta or
other large vessels to small vessels of skin or digits may complicate any intraarterial procedure.
8.5 A. Surgical therapy is reserved for severe symptoms after exercise and
pharmacologic agents are used, and quality of life is impaired. Pain at rest, lack
of symptoms for medical therapy, nonhealing ulcers, and gangrene are some of
those indications. Duplex ultrasound can help to discern whether the patient
is a potential surgical candidate. Arteriography may also be performed. Diffuse
atherosclerotic disease is a contraindication for surgery since bypass would not
help in the face of signiﬁcant and widespread disease.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Smoking cessation is the single most important intervention for atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease. Other treatments include pentoxifylline or cilostazol, regular exercise, and cardiovascular risk factor
modification.



Revascularization by angioplasty or bypass grafting may be indicated
for patients with debilitating claudication, ischemic rest pain, or tissue
necrosis.



Acute arterial occlusion that threatens limb viability is a medical emergency and requires immediate anticoagulation and investigation with
conventional arteriography.



Acute severe ischemia of an extremity causes the “six Ps”: pain, pallor,
pulselessness, paresthesias, poikilothermia, and paralysis. Chronic incomplete arterial occlusion may result only in exertional pain or fatigue, pallor
on elevation of the extremity, and rubor on dependency.

CASE 9
A 56-year-old man comes into your clinic as a new patient. Seven years ago at a
work-related health screening, he was diagnosed with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. At that time, he saw a physician who prescribed a diuretic and
encouraged him to lose some weight and to diet and exercise. Since that time,
the patient has not sought medical attention. During the past 2 months, he has
been experiencing occasional headaches, which he attributes to increased stress
at work. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and has
done so since he was 15 years old. He typically drinks two glasses of wine with dinner. On examination, the patient is obese, and you calculate his body mass index
(BMI) as 30 kg/m2. His blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg in the right arm and
170/94 mm Hg in the left arm. His blood pressure did not change with changes
in position. His heart rate is 84 bpm. He has no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.
Funduscopic examination reveals narrowing of the arteries, arteriovenous nicking,
and flame-shaped hemorrhages with cotton wool exudates. Cardiac examination
reveals that his point of maximal impulse is displaced 2 cm left of the midclavicular line. There is an S4 gallop. No murmurs are auscultated. Lung and abdomen
examinations are normal.

ANSWER TO CASE 9:
Hypertension, Outpatient
Summary: A 56-year-old hypertensive man is being evaluated as a new patient.
His blood pressures are in the range of 170/95 mm Hg. Funduscopic examination
reveals hypertensive retinopathy. His point of maximal impulse is displaced laterally,
suggesting cardiomegaly, and a fourth heart sound is consistent with a thickened,
noncompliant ventricle. In addition, he has multiple cardiovascular risk factors,
including his age, obesity, and smoking.
• Next steps:
1. Laboratory evaluation to evaluate renal function such as electrolytes, creatinine, and urinalysis; evaluation of other cardiovascular risk factors such as
serum glucose and lipid profile; and a baseline ECG to assess for target organ
damage.
2. Start the patient on a two-drug antihypertensive regimen that includes a
thiazide diuretic.
3. Recommend lifestyle changes, most importantly tobacco cessation.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the initial evaluation of a patient with hypertension.
2. Be familiar with the most common antihypertensive medications, and indications and cautions regarding their usage.
3. Be familiar with the various causes of secondary hypertension and when to pursue
these diagnoses.

Considerations
This is a 56-year-old man with severe hypertension, who has evidence, on physical
examination, of hypertensive end-organ damage, that is, hypertensive retinopathy
and left ventricular hypertrophy as well as multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic
disease. The most likely diagnosis is essential hypertension, but secondary causes
still must be considered. Although you have measured his blood pressure (BP) only
once in your clinic, he has been told before that he is hypertensive, and he already
appears to have end-organ damage of hypertension. His blood pressure is above
160/100 mm Hg, which places him in stage II hypertension, which warrants starting him on two-drug therapy without further delay.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO:
Hypertension
DEFINITIONS
ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION: Also known as idiopathic or primary hypertension. It has no known cause, yet it comprises approximately 80% to 95% of all cases
of hypertension.
LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION: A cornerstone in the treatment of hypertension, consisting of regular aerobic activity, weight loss, decreased salt intake, and
increased intake of fruit and vegetables, while decreasing the amount of total fat,
especially saturated fat, in the diet. Alcohol consumption should be moderated, no
more than two glasses of wine per day for men and one glass per day for women.
PREHYPERTENSION: Blood pressures 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg.
STAGE I HYPERTENSION: Blood pressures 140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg.
STAGE II HYPERTENSION: Blood pressures more than 160/100 mm Hg.
SECONDARY HYPERTENSION: Elevated arterial blood pressure with a known
underlying cause, such as renal artery stenosis or primary aldosteronism. Prevalence
is approximately 5% to 20% of all cases of hypertension.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Initial Evaluation and Management
Hypertension can first be staged, to guide the intensity of medical intervention, by
measuring blood pressures on two or more occasions. Underlying causes of hypertension must then be considered. Essential or idiopathic hypertension is the most
common form of hypertension, comprising 80% to 95% of cases, but approximately
5% to 20% of cases of hypertension are caused by secondary causes (Table 9–1).
To identify the secondary (and potentially reversible) causes of hypertension, the

clinician must be aware of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of the processes. A secondary cause of hypertension, and thus more extensive testing, is
indicated when patients have any of the following clinical features: age of onset
before 25 years or after 55 years, presenting with malignant hypertension, refractory hypertension requiring three or more antihypertensive medications, hypertension that has suddenly become uncontrolled, a rising creatinine level with the use
of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or other clinical signs of a
secondary cause.

OTHER CARDIAC RISK FACTORS AND EVALUATION FOR TARGET ORGAN DAMAGE
Cardiovascular risk factors and hypertensive target organ damage should be identified. The major risk factors of cardiovascular disease are age, cigarette smoking,
dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, kidney disease, and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Target organ damage of hypertension includes cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cerebrovascular disease. A complete
history and physical examination, including funduscopic examination, auscultation of the major arteries for bruits, palpation of the abdomen for enlarged kidneys, masses, or an enlarged abdominal aorta, evaluation of the lower extremities for
edema and perfusion, and a neurologic examination should be standard. Some initial laboratory testing is also indicated (Table 9–2). Counseling patients on lifestyle
changes is important at any blood pressure level and includes weight loss, limitation
of alcohol intake, increased aerobic physical activity, reduced sodium intake, cessation of smoking, and reduced intake of dietary saturated fat and cholesterol.

Therapy
Initial therapy should be based on the stage or degree of hypertension. For all
patients with hypertension, lifestyle modifications should be instituted. For those
with prehypertension (blood pressure 120-139/80-89 mm Hg), lifestyle modifications are the only interventions indicated unless they have another comorbid condition, such as heart failure or diabetes, which necessitates use of an antihypertensive.
Patient with stage I hypertension (blood pressure 140-159/90-99 mm Hg) should be
started on a single antihypertensive agent, whereas those with stage II hypertension
(blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg) usually will need at least two antihypertensives
in combination.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

For most patients, with hypertension, the degree of blood pressure reduction is
the major determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction, rather than the class of antihypertensive drug used. Each of the major classes of antihypertensives (thiazides,
beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors [ACEI] or ARB, and alphablockers) seem to be equally efficacious when used as monotherapy. In general,
younger patients may be more responsive to beta-blockers and ACEIs, and older
patients may be more responsive to calcium antagonists and thiazides. Among
African-Americans, thiazides may be more effective than beta-blockers, and ACEIs
or ARBs may be less effective than in white patients. The target blood pressure typically is 135/85 mm Hg, unless the patient has diabetes or renal disease, in which
case the target would be lower than 130/80 mm Hg. The Seventh Report of the
Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment
of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7), published in 2003, recommended that low-dose
thiazides should be used in the initial drug treatment of most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, unless there is a specific indication for a drug from another
class. Whatever drug class is used, a long-acting formulation that provides 24-hour
efficacy is preferred over short-acting agents for better compliance and more consistent blood pressure control. A list of oral antihypertensive drugs is extensive
(Table 9–3). At the writing of this book, JNC 8 was predicted to be released in draft
form for public comments as an update to JNC 7 sometime in 2012.
For some patients, there are specific compelling indications to use specific drug
classes. ACE inhibitors are the agents of choice in hypertensive patients with
diabetes or heart failure. Beta-blockers would be first-line agents in patients with
hypertension and coronary artery disease. Alpha-blockers may be considered in men
with hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Most patients ultimately need
more than one drug to control their blood pressure. It is critical to tailor the treatment to the patient’s personal, financial, lifestyle, and medical factors, and to periodically review compliance and adverse effects.

SELECTED CAUSES OF SECONDARY HYPERTENSION
The most common cause of secondary hypertension is renal disease (renal parenchymal or renovascular). Renal artery stenosis is caused by atherosclerotic disease
with hemodynamically significant blockage of the renal artery in older patients or
by fibromuscular dysplasia in younger adults. The clinician must have a high index
of suspicion, and further testing may be indicated, for instance, in an individual
with diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Potassium level may be low or borderline low
in patients with renal artery stenosis caused by secondary hyperaldosteronism. A
captopril-enhanced radionuclide renal scan often is helpful in establishing the diagnosis; other diagnostic tools include magnetic resonance angiography and spiral
computed tomography. Surgical or angioplastic correction of the vascular occlusion
may be considered.
Polycystic kidney disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The classic clinical findings are positive family history of polycystic kidney disease, bilateral
flank masses, flank pain, elevated blood pressure, and hematuria. Other causes of
chronic renal disease very commonly lead to hypertension.

Other causes of secondary hypertension include primary hyperaldosteronism,
which typically will cause hypertension and hypokalemia. Anabolic steroids,
sympathomimetic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents, and illicit drugs, such as cocaine, as well as licit ones, such
as caffeine and alcohol, are included in possible secondary causes of hypertension.
Obstructive sleep apnea is another fairly common cause of hypertension. The
cause of obstructive sleep apnea is a critical narrowing of the upper airway that
occurs when the resistance of the upper airway musculature fails against the negative
pressure generated by inspiration. In most patients, this is a result of a reduced airway
size that is congenital or perhaps complicated by obesity. These patients frequently
become hypoxic and hypercarbic multiple times during sleep, which, among other
things, eventually can lead to systemic vasoconstriction, systolic hypertension, and
pulmonary hypertension.
Hyperthyroidism may also cause hypertension. The patient will have a widened
pulse pressure with increased systolic blood pressure and decreased diastolic blood
pressure, as well as a hyperdynamic precordium. The patient may have warm skin,
tremor, and thyroid gland enlargement or a palpable thyroid nodule. A low level of
serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and elevated levels of thyroid hormones
(such as free T4) are diagnostic.
Glucocorticoid excess states, including Cushing syndrome, and iatrogenic
(treatment with glucocorticoids) states usually present with thinning of the extremities with truncal obesity, round moon face, supraclavicular fat pad, purple striae,
acne, and possible psychiatric symptoms. An excess of corticosteroids can cause
secondary hypertension because many glucocorticoid hormones have mineralocorticoid activity. Dexamethasone suppression testing of the serum cortisol level aids in
the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome.
Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aortic lumen and usually is diagnosed in younger patients by finding hypertension along with discordant upper and lower extremity blood pressures. Coarctation of the aorta can cause
leg claudication, cold extremities, and diminished or absence of femoral pulses as a
result of decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities.
Carcinoid syndrome is caused by overproduction of serotonin. Carcinoid tumors
arise from the enterochromaffin cells located in the gastrointestinal tract and in the
lungs. Clinical manifestations include cutaneous flushing, headache, diarrhea, and
bronchial constriction with wheezing, and often, hypertension.
Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-releasing tumor that typically produces
hypertension. Clinical manifestations include headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis, and chest pain. Other symptoms include anxiety, nervousness, tremor, pallor,
malaise, and occasionally nausea and/or vomiting. Symptoms typically are paroxysmal
and associated with hypertension.

after an evaluation is noted to have no complications. According to JNC 7,
which of the following antihypertensive agents are generally considered ﬁrstline agents for this individual?
A. Thiazide diuretics
B. Angiotensin-receptor blockers
C. Alpha-blocking agents
D. Nitrates
E. Vasodilators such as hydralazine
9.4 A 45-year-old man with type 2 diabetes is noted to have blood pressures of
145/90 and 150/96 mm Hg on two separate occasions. Which of the following
is the best initial therapy for this patient?
A. Hydrochlorothiazide
B. ACE inhibitor
C. Beta-blocker
D. Beta-blocker and hydrochlorothiazide

ANSWERS
9.1 C. The central obesity, abdominal striae, hirsutism, and easy bruisability are
consistent with Cushing syndrome, a disease of adrenal steroid overproduction.
9.2 B. Prognosis in hypertension depends on the patient’s other cardiovascular risks
and observed end-organ effects from the hypertension.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

99

9.3 A. Thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone are generally considered ﬁrst-line agents for uncomplicated hypertension because of their
effect in reducing cardiovascular mortality and their cost-effectiveness.
9.4 B. For diabetics, in general, the antihypertensive agent of choice is the ACE
inhibitor. If the blood pressure is uncontrolled, then a thiazide diuretic may be
added. The patient will have survival advantage with the ACE inhibitor.

CLINICAL PEARLS


In general, the diagnosis of hypertension requires two or more blood
pressure measurements on at least two visits.



Cardiovascular disease risk evaluation consists of identifying target
organ dysfunction and cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes and
hyperlipidemia.



Most patients with hypertension have essential hypertension, but secondary causes of hypertension should be evaluated when clinically indicated.



Renal diseases, including renovascular hypertension, are the most common causes of secondary hypertension.



Lifestyle modifications consisting of dietary changes, exercise, and moderation of alcohol intake are indicated to address hypertension control
and lower overall cardiovascular risk.



For most patients, the degree of blood pressure reduction is the major
determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction, rather than the class of antihypertensive drug used.

CASE 10
A 39-year-old man is brought to the ER by ambulance after he was found wandering in the street in a disoriented state. He is confused and agitated, and further
history is obtained from his wife. She reports that for the last several months he
has been complaining of intermittent headaches and palpitations, and he had
experienced feelings of lightheadedness and flushed skin when playing basketball. Three weeks ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and was started on
clonidine twice per day. He took the clonidine for 2 weeks, but because the drug
made him feel sedated, he was instructed by his physician 5 days ago to stop the
clonidine and to begin metoprolol twice daily. On examination, he is afebrile, with
heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of
98%, and blood pressure of 215/132 mm Hg, equal in both arms. He is agitated
and diaphoretic, and he is looking around the room but does not appear to recognize his wife. His pupils are dilated but reactive, and he has papilledema and
scattered retinal hemorrhages. He has no thyromegaly. Heart, lung, and abdominal examinations are normal. His pulses are bounding and equal in his arms and
legs. He moves all of his extremities well, his reflexes are brisk and symmetric, and
he is slightly tremulous. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head is
read as negative for hemorrhage. Laboratory studies include a normal leukocyte
count and a hemoglobin level of 16.5 g/dL. Serum sodium level is 139 mEq/L,
potassium 4.7 mEq/L, chloride 105 mEq/L, HCO3 29 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) 32 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.3 mg/dL. Urinalysis is normal, and a urine drug
screen is negative. Lumbar puncture is performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) has no red or white blood cells, no xanthochromia, and normal protein and
glucose.

ANSWERS TO CASE 10:
Hypertensive Encephalopathy/Pheochromocytoma
Summary: A 39-year-old man recently diagnosed with hypertension is now in the
ER in an acute confusional state and with critically elevated blood pressures. He has
been having episodes of palpitations, headaches, and lightheadedness. His medication was recently changed from clonidine to metoprolol. His examination is significant for dilated pupils, papilledema, and bounding peripheral pulses. The urine drug
screen is negative. The CT scan of the head and CSF studies show no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or infection.
• Most likely diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy.
• Possible etiology: Pheochromocytoma, consider clonidine rebound hypertension.
• Next step: Admit to the intensive care unit (ICU), immediately lower blood
pressure with a parenteral agent, and closely monitor arterial pressure.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the definition and management of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies.
2. Understand the relationship between systemic blood pressure and cerebral blood
flow.
3. Know how to diagnose and medically treat a patient with a pheochromocytoma.

Considerations
This is a relatively young man with severely elevated blood pressures who presents
with altered mental status. Use of illicit drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines,
must be considered, but this patient’s drug screen was negative. Hypertensive
encephalopathy, a symptom complex of severely elevated blood pressures, confusion, increased intracranial pressure, and/or seizures, is a diagnosis of exclusion,
meaning other causes for the patient’s acute mental decline, such as stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, or mass lesions, must be ruled out. Knowing the
specific etiology of the patient’s hypertension is not necessary to treat his encephalopathy; urgent blood pressure lowering is indicated. However, it is not necessary,
and it may be harmful to normalize the blood pressure too quickly, because it may
cause cerebral hypoperfusion. Parenteral medications should be used to lower the
blood pressure to 160/100-110 mm Hg range. The patient has tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, and a slight tremor, all signs of a hyperadrenergic
state. Pheochromocytoma must be considered as a possible underlying etiology of his
hypertension. His antihypertensive medication changes may also be contributory—
perhaps clonidine rebound.

APPROACH TO:
Hypertensive Emergencies
DEFINITIONS
MEN IIA: Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes that can occur in families. Type
IIa includes pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and hyperparathyroidism.
MEN IIB: Pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and mucosal neuromas.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hypertensive crises are critical elevations in blood pressure, which usually are classified as either hypertensive emergencies or urgencies. The presence of acute endorgan damage constitutes a hypertensive emergency, whereas the absence of such
complications is considered hypertensive urgency. Examples of acute end-organ
damage include hypertensive encephalopathy, myocardial ischemia or infarction
associated with markedly elevated blood pressure, aortic dissection, stroke, declining renal function with proteinuria, and pulmonary edema secondary to acute left
ventricular failure.
Hypertensive emergencies require immediate reduction in blood pressure over
minutes to hours, typically with intravenous medications and close monitoring in an
intensive care unit. Hypertensive urgencies also require prompt medical attention,
but the blood pressure can be lowered over 1 to 2 days and can be monitored in the
outpatient setting for patients with reliable follow-up.
Hypertensive crises are uncommon but occur most often in patients with an established history of essential hypertension, that is, hypertension without an apparent
underlying cause. A crisis may be precipitated by use of sympathomimetic agents,
such as cocaine, or by conditions that produce excess sympathetic discharge, such as
clonidine withdrawal. Hypertensive crises also result from underlying diseases that
cause hypertension, such as renovascular disease (eg, renal artery stenosis), renal
parenchymal disease (eg, glomerulonephritis), and pheochromocytoma.
Although the pathophysiology is not completely understood, abrupt rises in vascular resistance are met with endothelial compensation by the release of vasodilator molecules such as nitric oxide. If the increase in arterial pressure persists, the
endothelial response is overwhelmed and decompensates, leading to a further rise in
pressure and endothelial damage and dysfunction.
Cerebral blood flow is a good example of vascular compensation by vasodilation or vasoconstriction in response to changes in arterial pressure (Figure 10–1). In
normotensive adults, cerebral blood flow remains relatively constant over a range
of mean arterial pressures between 60 and 120 mm Hg because cerebral vasoconstriction limits excessive cerebral perfusion. As the mean arterial pressure increases
beyond the normal range of cerebral autoregulation, there is cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, leading to
vasogenic edema and the formation of micro-hemorrhages. Patients then manifest
symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy, such as lethargy, confusion, headaches,

or vision changes. Typical imaging findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
include posterior leukoencephalopathy, usually in the parietooccipital regions,
which may or may not be seen on CT scanning. Without therapy, the condition can
lead to seizures, coma, and death.
The definition of hypertensive emergency does not require numerical thresholds of arterial pressure but is based on end-organ effects. Autoregulation failure can occur in previously normotensive individuals at blood pressures as low as
160/100 mm Hg; however, individuals with longstanding hypertension frequently
develop adaptive mechanisms (eg, cerebral arterial autoregulation) and may not
show clinical manifestations until the blood pressure rises to above 220/110 mm Hg.
Thus, emergent treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy (and indeed all hypertensive emergencies) should focus on the symptoms rather than the numbers. In
fact, it may be dangerous to “normalize” the blood pressure of patients with chronic
hypertension. As a consequence of the right shift in the autoregulation curve, rapid
lowering of blood pressures may lead to decreased perfusion to the brain, resulting in
cerebral ischemia or infarction, or similar renal or coronary hypoperfusion. Usually,
a reasonable goal is reduction of mean arterial pressures by no more than 25% or to
a diastolic blood pressure of 100 to 110 mm Hg over a period of minutes to hours.
Treatment of hypertensive emergencies usually necessitates parenteral medication without delay; direct blood pressure monitoring with an arterial catheter often
is necessary. One of the most commonly used medications for treating hypertensive
emergencies is sodium nitroprusside. It has the advantage of nearly instantaneous
onset of action, and its dose can be easily titrated for a smooth reduction in blood
pressure. However, its metabolite may accumulate, resulting in cyanide or thiocyanate toxicity when it is given for more than 2 to 3 days. Certain clinical situations
may favor the use of other medications. Intravenous loop diuretics and vasodilators

such as nitroglycerin decrease the preload (central venous pressure) in acute pulmonary edema. Myocardial ischemia or infarction is treated with intravenous nitroglycerin to improve coronary perfusion and beta-blockers to reduce blood pressure,
heart rate, and myocardial oxygen demand. Patients with aortic dissection benefit
from medications that reduce the shear forces affecting the aorta, which will help
limit propagation of the dissection. A useful technique in treating these individuals
is the use of intravenous nitroprusside to lower the arterial blood pressure and a betablocker to blunt reflex tachycardia. Alternatively, intravenous labetalol, a combined
alpha- and beta-blocker, alone can be used. Patients presenting with acute cerebral
infarction generally should not have acute blood pressure lowering because of the
possibility of worsening cerebral ischemia.
The vast majority of hypertension has no discernible cause, so-called essential
hypertension. Some patients have secondary causes, such as renal artery stenosis,
hyperaldosteronism, or pheochromocytoma. This patient’s history of paroxysmal
hypertension with headaches, palpitations, and hyperadrenergic state (flushing,
dilated pupils, diaphoresis) suggests the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing tumors that arise from chromaffin cells
of the adrenal medulla. Other symptoms may include episodic anxiety, tremor, and
orthostatic hypotension caused by volume contraction from pressure-induced natriuresis. Although uncommon, accounting for only 0.01% to 0.1% of hypertensive
individuals, these tumors have important therapeutic considerations.
The diagnosis is established by measuring increased concentrations of catecholamines or their metabolites in either urine or plasma. Usually, a 24-hour urine
collection is assayed for metanephrines, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and catecholamines. One-time measurement of plasma free metanephrines is a convenient
and fairly sensitive screening test. After the biochemical tests document the excess
catecholamines, the next step is to locate the tumor for surgical removal. Approximately 90% of pheochromocytomas are in the adrenal gland, usually identified by
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. If the initial imaging is unrevealing, scintigraphic localization with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG)
or an octreotide (somatostatin-analogue) scan is indicated, because this radioisotope
is preferentially taken up in catecholamine-producing tumors.
The treatment of choice for these tumors is surgical resection, but it is critical
to reverse the acute and chronic effects of the excess catecholamines prior to excision. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible,
long-acting agent, started a week prior to surgery help to prevent hypertensive
exacerbations, which are especially worrisome during surgery. To expand the commonly seen contracted blood volume, a liberal salt diet is initiated. Sometimes, a
beta-blocking agent is started, but only after alpha-blockade is established. The
products of pheochromocytomas stimulate both the alpha- and beta-adrenergic
receptors; thus, using a beta-blocker alone may worsen the hypertension because
of unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Also, beta-blockade may result in
acute pulmonary edema, especially in the presence of cardiomyopathy secondary to
chronic catecholamine exposure.
Less than 10% of pheochromocytomas are familial, and these tend to be bilateral.
One should consider screening for the presence of the RET protooncogene seen in

106

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MEN II) or the VHL gene for von HippelLindau syndrome, or screening family members for these diseases as well as for familial
pheochromocytoma and neurofibromatosis.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
10.1 A 50-year-old man with chronic hypertension presents at the clinic having
run out of his medications, lisinopril and amlodipine, for more than a month.
He is asymptomatic and has a blood pressure of 200/104 mm Hg. Which of the
following is the best management?
A. Admit in the hospital and initiate intravenous nitroprusside.
B. Prescribe clonidine 0.1 mg TID and recheck the blood pressure in 24 to
48 hours.
C. Restart his ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker.
D. Refer to a social worker and do not prescribe any antihypertensive agent.
10.2 An 80-year-old woman without a history of hypertension undergoes surgery for
a hip fracture. Her blood pressure on postoperative day 1 is 178/110 mm Hg.
She is asymptomatic except for hip pain. Which of the following is the best
next step?
A. Transfer the patient to the intensive care unit, obtain cardiac enzyme levels, and lower the blood pressures to the 140/90 mm Hg range.
B. Control the pain and monitor the blood pressure.
C. Start the patient on a beta-blocker and monitor the blood pressure.
D. Restrict visitors and turn down television, alarms, and other noise.
10.3 A 61-year-old man with coronary artery disease complains of progressive
orthopnea and pedal edema. He is hospitalized with a blood pressure of
190/105 mm Hg. Cardiac enzyme levels and ECG are normal. Intravenous furosemide has been administered. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Prescribe a beta-blocker to decrease myocardial oxygen demands.
B. Start intravenous dopamine.
C. Observe.
D. Start an ACE inhibitor.
10.4 A 58-year-old woman with aphasia and right-arm weakness of 8 hours’ duration is seen in the ER. CT scan shows no intracranial hemorrhage. Her blood
pressure is 162/98 mm Hg. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Normalize the blood pressure with beta-blockade.
B. Admit to ICU with sodium nitroprusside.
C. Normalize the blood pressure with an ACE inhibitor.
D. Observe the blood pressure.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

107

ANSWERS
10.1 B. This man has a hypertensive urgency—elevated blood pressures without
end-organ symptoms. The appropriate treatment is re-initiation of blood pressure medications and reassessment in 24 to 48 hours. Clonidine would not be
a good maintenance therapy given questions regarding his compliance with
treatment and the risk of rebound hypertension.
10.2 B. Elevated blood pressures without symptoms may occur acutely after surgery,
particularly as a consequence of postoperative pain. Blood pressure medications are usually not indicated, but rather, pain control is the primary treatment. Lowering of blood pressure can lead to orthostatic hypotension when
the patient gets out of bed.
10.3 D. Elevated blood pressures may exacerbate congestive heart failure and must
be treated. Generally, beta-blockers are avoided when patients are volume
overloaded because beta-blockers decrease myocardial contractility. ACE
inhibition reduces afterload, and oral nitrates or IV nitroglycerine reduce
preload, and are used to treat acute heart failure.
10.4 D. In general, blood pressure should not be acutely decreased in an individual
suspected of having a stroke because of the concern for cerebral hypoperfusion
and worsening brain ischemia. If thrombolytic therapy is considered, blood
pressure should be controlled to <185/100 mm Hg, but this patient’s symptom
duration precludes that consideration.

CLINICAL PEARLS


A hypertensive emergency is defined as an episode of elevated blood
pressure associated with acute end-organ damage or dysfunction and
requires immediate lowering of the blood pressure.



Asymptomatic patients with elevated blood pressure usually can be
started on an oral regimen and reassessed as outpatients in 24 to 48
hours.



The cerebral autoregulation curve of individuals with chronic hypertension is shifted to the right. Nevertheless, marked elevations in mean arterial pressure can exceed the ability of cerebral vessels to constrict, causing
hyperperfusion, cerebral edema, and hypertensive encephalopathy.



Pheochromocytomas may cause paroxysmal blood pressure elevations,
in association with episodic headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis.



Preoperative blood pressure control in pheochromocytoma can be
achieved with the use of alpha-blockers such as phenoxybenzamine. Betablockers used alone can, paradoxically, increase blood pressure because
of unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects.

CASE 11
A 28-year-old man comes to your clinic complaining of a 5-day history of nausea,
vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, fever to 101°F, and muscle aches. He has lost
his appetite, but he is able to tolerate liquids and has no diarrhea. He has no significant medical history or family history, and he has not traveled outside the United
States. He admits to having 12 different lifetime sexual partners, denies illicit drug
use, and drinks alcohol occasionally, but not since this illness began. He takes
no medications routinely, but he has been taking acetaminophen, approximately
30 tablets per day for 2 days for fever and body aches since this illness began.
On examination, his temperature is 100.8°F, heart rate 98 bpm, and blood pressure 120/74 mm Hg. He appears jaundiced, his chest is clear to auscultation,
and his heart rhythm is regular without murmurs. His liver percusses 12 cm, and
is smooth and slightly tender to palpation. He has no abdominal distention or
peripheral edema. Laboratory values are significant for a normal complete blood
count, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 3440 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2705 IU/L, total bilirubin 24.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin

ANSWERS TO CASE 11:
Acute Viral Hepatitis, Possible Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity
Summary: A 28-year-old man complains of nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain,
fever, and myalgias. He has had 12 different lifetime sexual partners and currently
is taking acetaminophen. He appears icteric and has a low-grade fever and tender
hepatomegaly. Results of his laboratory studies are consistent with severe hepatocellular injury and somewhat impaired hepatic function.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute hepatitis, either viral infection or toxic injury,
possibly exacerbated by acetaminophen (APAP) use.
• Most important immediate diagnostic test: Acetaminophen level, because
acetaminophen toxicity may greatly exacerbate liver injury but is treatable.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the use of viral serologic studies for diagnosing hepatitis A, B, and
C infections.
2. Know the prognosis for acute viral hepatitis and recognize fulminant hepatic
failure.
3. Know measures to prevent hepatitis A and B infections.
4. Understand the use of the acetaminophen nomogram and the treatment of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.

Considerations
This patient has an acute onset of hepatic injury and systemic symptoms that predate
his acetaminophen use. The markedly elevated hepatic transaminase and bilirubin
levels are consistent with viral hepatitis or possibly toxic injury. This patient denied
intravenous drug use, which would be a risk factor for hepatitis B and C infections.
His sexual history is a possible clue. The degree and pattern of transaminase alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation can provide some clues to help differentiate possible etiologies. Transaminase levels more
than 1000 IU/L are seen in conditions that produce extensive hepatic necrosis, such
as toxic injury, viral hepatitis, and ischemia (“shock liver”). Patients with alcoholic
hepatitis almost always has levels less than 500 IU/L and often have an AST/ALT
ratio of 2:1. In this case, it is important to consider the possibility of acetaminophen
toxicity, both because the condition can produce fatal liver failure and because
an effective antidote is available. By obtaining a serum acetaminophen level and
knowing the time of his last ingestion, these data can be plotted on a nomogram
(Figure 11–1) to help predict acetaminophen-related liver damage and the possible
need for N-acetylcysteine, which is the antidote.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Hepatitis
DEFINITIONS
HEPATITIS: An inflammation of the liver. At least six viruses that cause hepatitis
have been identified, referred to as hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, and G.
CHRONIC HEPATITIS: A syndrome that is defined clinically by evidence of
liver disease with inflammation and necrosis for at least 6 consecutive months, most
commonly with hepatitis B, C, and D.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Viral Hepatitis
Most cases of acute hepatitis are caused by infection with one of the five viruses:
hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. They can produce virtually indistinguishable clinical
syndromes, although it is unusual to observe acute hepatitis C. Affected individuals

112

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

often complain of a prodrome of nonspecific constitutional symptoms, including
fever, nausea, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, and sometimes pharyngitis and
coryza. This is followed by the onset of visible jaundice caused by hyperbilirubinemia,
with tenderness and enlargement of the liver, and dark urine caused by bilirubinuria.
The clinical course and prognosis vary based on the type of virus causing the hepatitis.
Hepatitis A and E both are very contagious and transmitted by fecal-oral route,
usually by contaminated food or water where sanitation is poor, and in daycare by
children. Hepatitis A is found worldwide and is the most common cause of acute
viral hepatitis in the United States. Hepatitis E is much less common and is found
in Asia, Africa, Central America, and the Caribbean. Both hepatitis A and E infections usually lead to self-limited illnesses and generally resolve within weeks. Almost
all patients with hepatitis A recover completely and have no long-term complications. A few may have fulminant disease resulting in liver failure. Most patients
with hepatitis E also have uncomplicated courses, but some patients, particularly
pregnant women, have been reported to develop severe hepatic necrosis and fatal
liver failure.
Hepatitis B is the second most common type of viral hepatitis in the United
States, and it is usually sexually transmitted. It also may be acquired parenterally,
such as by intravenous drug use, and during birth from chronically infected mothers.
The outcome depends on the age at which the infection was acquired. Up to 90% of
infected newborns develop chronic hepatitis B infection, which places the affected
infant at significant risk of hepatocellular carcinoma later in adulthood. For individuals infected later in life, approximately 95% of patients will recover completely without sequelae. Between 5% and 10% of patients will develop chronic hepatitis, which
may progress to cirrhosis. A chronic carrier state may be seen in which the virus
continues to replicate, but it does not cause irreversible hepatic damage in the host.
Hepatitis C is transmitted parenterally by blood transfusions or intravenous
drug use, and rarely by sexual contact. The mode of transmission is unknown in
approximately 40% of cases. It is uncommonly diagnosed as a cause of acute hepatitis, often producing subclinical infection, but is frequently diagnosed later as a cause
of chronic hepatitis.
Hepatitis D is a defective RNA virus that requires the presence of the hepatitis
B virus to replicate. It can be acquired as a coinfection simultaneously with acute
hepatitis B or as a later superinfection in a person with a chronic hepatitis B infection. Patients afflicted with chronic hepatitis B virus who then become infected
with hepatitis D may suffer clinical deterioration; in 10% to 20% of these cases,
individuals develop severe fatal hepatic failure.
Fortunately, in most cases of acute viral hepatitis, patients recover completely,
so the treatment is generally supportive. However, fulminant hepatic failure as a
result of massive hepatic necrosis may progress over a period of weeks. This usually
may be caused by infection by the hepatitis B and D viruses, or can be drug-induced.
Toxin- or drug-induced liver injury is the cause of the majority of cases of acute
liver failure. Drug- or toxin-induced liver injury may be due to directly toxic effects
(acetaminophen, Amanita phalloides), or due to idiosyncratic reactions (halothane,
isoniazid, phenytoin). Direct toxic effects are predictable and dose-dependent, but
idiosyncratic reactions are not.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

113

Acute hepatic failure is characterized by rapid progression of encephalopathy
from confusion or somnolence to coma. Patients also have worsening coagulopathy as measured by increasing prothrombin times, rising bilirubin levels, ascites and
peripheral edema, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and lactic acidosis. Fulminant
hepatitis carries a poor prognosis (the mortality for comatose patients is 80%) and
often is fatal without an emergency liver transplant.

Diagnosis Clinical presentation does not reliably distinguish a specific viral
etiology, so serologic studies are used to establish a diagnosis. Anti–hepatitis A
immunoglobulin M (IgM) establishes an acute hepatitis A infection. Anti–hepatitis
C antibody is present in acute hepatitis C, but the test result may be negative for
several weeks. The hepatitis C RNA assay, which becomes positive earlier in the
disease course, often aids in the diagnosis. Acute hepatitis B infection is diagnosed
by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the clinical context of
elevated serum transaminase levels and jaundice. HBsAg later disappears when the
antibody (anti-HBs) is produced (Figure 11–2). There is often an interval of a few
weeks between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBsAb.
This period is referred to as the “window period.” During this interval, the presence
of anti–hepatitis B core antigen IgM (anti–HBc IgM) is indicative of an acute
hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B precore antigen (HBeAg) represents a high level
of viral replication and high infectivity. It is almost always present during acute
infection, but its persistence after 6 weeks of illness is a sign of chronic infection and
high infectivity. Persistence of HBsAg or HBeAg is a marker for chronic hepatitis or
a chronic carrier state; elevated versus normal serum transaminase levels distinguish
between these two entities, respectively. Patients who have been vaccinated against
hepatitis B will have a positive HBsAb, but no other positive serology.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Prevention The efﬁcacy of the hepatitis A vaccine (available in two doses given
6 months apart) exceeds 90%. It is indicated for individuals planning to travel to
endemic areas. Postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis A immunoglobulin, along
with the ﬁrst injection of the vaccine, should be given to household and intimate
contacts within 2 weeks of exposure. The hepatitis B vaccine (given in three doses
over 6 months) provides effective immunity in more than 90% of patients. It is
recommended for health-care workers, as well as for universal vaccination of infants
in the United States. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) is given after exposure,
such as a needle-stick injury from an infected patient, or to newborns of infected
mothers. The ﬁrst inoculation of the vaccine usually is given concurrently. There
is no immunization and no proven postexposure prophylaxis for persons exposed
to hepatitis C. Interferon and lamivudine are used to treat patients with chronic
hepatitis B. Patients with chronic hepatitis C can be treated with peginterferon or
ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor is added if they have genotype I.
Acetaminophen Hepatitis
Acetaminophen-induced hepatocellular injury may result after a single, large ingestion, as in a suicide attempt, or by chronic use of over-the-counter acetaminophencontaining preparations for treatment of pain or fever. Hepatic toxicity most often
occurs after an acute ingestion of 10 g or more, but lower doses may cause injury
in patients with preexisting liver disease, particularly in those who abuse alcohol.
Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which produces a toxic metabolite; this metabolite is detoxified by binding
to glutathione. Potential hepatic injury is greater when P450 activity is augmented
by drugs such as ethanol or phenobarbital, or when less glutathione is available,
as in alcoholism, malnutrition, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Acetaminophen levels are measured between 4 and 24 hours after an acute ingestion and plotted on a nomogram to predict possible hepatotoxicity and determine
if treatment is necessary (Figure 11–1). Sometimes, empiric therapy is started even
before laboratory results return.
If acetaminophen levels are above the level that predisposes to hepatic injury,
treatment is started with gastric decontamination with charcoal and administration of N-acetylcysteine, which provides cysteine to replenish glutathione stores.
N-acetylcysteine should be started within the first 10 hours to prevent liver damage
and is continued for 72 hours. Meanwhile, the patient should not receive any medications that are known to be hepatotoxic.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
11.1 A 25-year-old medical student is stuck with a hollow needle during a procedure
performed on a patient known to have hepatitis B and C viral infection, but
who is HIV negative. The student’s baseline laboratory studies include serology: HBsAg negative, anti-HBsAb positive, anti-HBc IgG negative. Which of
the following regarding this medical student’s hepatitis status is true?
A. Prior vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine
B. Acute infection with hepatitis B virus
C. Prior infection with hepatitis B virus
D. The student was vaccinated for hepatitis B but is not immune
11.2 What postexposure prophylaxis should the student described in Question 11.1
receive?
A. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg)
B. Oral lamivudine
C. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
D. Reassurance
11.3 In a suicide attempt, an 18-year-old adolescent female took 4 g of acetaminophen,
approximately 8 hours previously. Her acetaminophen level is 30 μg/mL.
Which of the following is the best next step to be performed for this patient?
A. Immediately start N-acetylcysteine
B. Observation
C. Alkalinize the urine
D. Administer intravenous activated charcoal

ANSWERS
11.1 A. This student’s serology is most consistent with vaccination and not prior
infection. Like all health-care workers, the student should have been vaccinated against the hepatitis B virus, which induces anti–HBs IgG antibody,
which is thought to be protective. Not all people receiving the vaccine develop
an adequate antibody titer; if none were detected, it would indicate the need
for revaccination. Patients with prior hepatitis B infection will also likely have
anti-HBsAb but will also have anti–HBc IgG. Acute infection would be signiﬁed by the presence of either HBsAg or anti–HBc IgM.
11.2 D. No postexposure prophylaxis is deﬁnitively indicated. The student has
detectable protective antibody levels against the hepatitis B virus, and if the
levels are judged to be adequate, the student is protected against infection.
Oral lamivudine is a treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection and is part of
an antiretroviral prophylaxis if the patient was HIV positive. There is no effective prophylaxis for hepatitis C exposure.

116

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

11.3 B. The serum acetaminophen level of 30 μg/mL, with last ingestion 8 hours
previously, is plotted on the nomogram and falls below the “danger zone” of
possible hepatic injury. Thus, this patient should be observed. Sometimes,
patients will take more than one medication so that serum and/or urine drug
testing may be worthwhile. Gastrointestinal activated charcoal, not intravenous charcoal, is used for other ingestions.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common cause of acute hepatic failure is toxin or drug injury,
which may be due to direct toxic effects, or idiosyncratic reaction.



The large majority of adults with acute hepatitis B viral infection recover
completely, but 5% to 10% develop chronic hepatitis.



Vaccination for hepatitis B should produce measurable HBsAb. Presence
of anti-HBc IgG indicates evidence of prior infection. Anti–HBc IgM can be
positive during the “window period” of acute infection.



Prevention of hepatitis B viral infection hinges on long-term immunity
with a highly effective recombinant vaccine, or postexposure prophylaxis
with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg). There is no postexposure prophylaxis or vaccine for hepatitis C.



The likelihood of toxic acetaminophen injury and the need for treatment
can be predicted from a nomogram based on serum level and the time
since last ingestion.

CASE 12
A 38-year-old woman presents to your clinic for evaluation of menstrual irregularity. She states that her periods started when she was 12 years old, and they have
been fairly regular ever since, coming once every 28 to 30 days. She has had three
previous uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. However, approximately
9 months ago, her cycles seemed to lengthen, and for the last 3 months she has
not had a period at all. She stopped breast-feeding 3 years ago, but over the last
3 months she noticed that she could express a small amount of milky fluid from
her breasts. She had a bilateral tubal ligation after her last pregnancy, and she
has no other medical or surgical history. She takes no medications except multivitamins. Over the last year or so, she thinks she has gained about 10 lb, and she
feels as if she has no energy despite adequate sleep. She has noticed some mild
thinning of her hair and slightly more coarse skin texture. She denies headaches
or visual changes. Her physical examination, including pelvic and breast examinations, are normal. She is not obese or hirsute. Slight whitish nipple discharge is
elicited from her breasts. Her pregnancy test is negative.

ANSWERS TO CASE 12:
Oligomenorrhea Caused by Hypothyroidism
and Hyperprolactinemia
Summary: A 38-year-old woman complains of oligomenorrhea and now secondary
amenorrhea, along with galactorrhea. She previously had regular menses and three
uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. She had a bilateral tubal ligation after
her last pregnancy, but she has no other medical or surgical history, and she takes
no medications that might cause galactorrhea. She has experienced weight gain,
fatigue, mild thinning of her hair, and slightly more coarse skin. She denies headaches or visual changes, which might suggest a pituitary adenoma. Her physical
examination, including pelvic and breast examinations, are normal. She is not obese
or hirsute. You can elicit slight whitish nipple discharge.
• Most likely diagnosis: Oligomenorrhea and galactorrhea due to hypothyroidism.
• Most likely etiology: In this patient with symptoms of weight gain, fatigue,
thinning hair, and galactorrhea in the setting of previously normal menses,
hypothyroidism is the most likely diagnosis.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the differential diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea and the approach
to the investigation of possible hormonal causes.
2. Understand the interactions of the hormones involved in the hypothalamicpituitary-gonadal axis.
3. Recognize the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of hypothyroidism.
4. Be familiar with the treatment of hypothyroidism.

Considerations
This 38-year-old woman presents with secondary amenorrhea, weight gain, fatigue,
and galactorrhea despite having previously normal menses and discontinuing breastfeeding 3 years ago. Her history of fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss suggest a systemic cause of her symptoms, possibly hypothyroidism. However, her normal physical
examination with lack of myxedema or bradycardia, normal reflexes, normal cognition, and nondisplaced point of maximal impulse suggest mild hypothyroidism. Lack
of virilization or obesity does not exclude polycystic ovarian syndrome, but their
absence makes this diagnosis less likely. Hypothyroidism alone could attribute to
galactorrhea, because hypothyroidism can be associated with hyperprolactinemia.
Prolactinomas can also cause galactorrhea as well as secondary amenorrhea, however, and should be excluded.

APPROACH TO:
Oligomenorrhea
DEFINITIONS
AMENORRHEA: Primary—Absence of menarche by the age of 16 years regardless
of the presence or absence of secondary sex characteristics. Secondary—Absence of
menstruation for 3 or more months in women with normal past menses.
GALACTORRHEA: Any discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast, may
be unilateral or bilateral, and may appear clear, milky, or bloody.
OLIGOMENORRHEA: Menses occurring at infrequent intervals of more than
40 days or fewer than nine menses per year.
POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: Syndrome characterized by infertility,
hirsutism, obesity, and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and often clinically significant insulin resistance.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The assessment of oligomenorrhea is similar to the workup for secondary amenorrhea with the understanding that secondary amenorrhea is present when a normally
menstruating woman stops having periods for 3 consecutive months or more. The
most common cause of both symptoms, and the easiest to exclude in the clinic, is
pregnancy. A negative in-clinic pregnancy test should be confirmed with a serum
beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Primary amenorrhea is present when
the first menses has not appeared in a girl by the age of 16 years and is generally
caused by a variety of genetic or congenital defects and is commonly associated with
disorders of puberty. Given this patient’s age and history, primary amenorrhea is not a
consideration; thus, a diagnostic pathway for secondary amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea
should be undertaken.

PROBLEMS OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-OVARIAN AXIS
Excluding pregnancy and problems in the genital outflow tract, disorders of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis account for the largest number of cases of
oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. Disorders of the hypothalamus account for the
largest percentage of abnormality (>45%); these include problems of nutrition
(rapid weight loss/anorexia), excessive exercise, stress, and infiltrative diseases (eg,
craniopharyngioma, sarcoidosis, histiocytosis). The largest single cause of oligomenorrhea is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), accounting for 30% of all cases.
PCOS was once thought to be a disease originating in the ovary; however, it now
is known that PCOS is a much more complicated neuroendocrine disorder with
evidence of estrogenization, as well as insulin resistance. Other important causes
of amenorrhea include diseases of the pituitary, specifically neoplasms (eg, prolactinomas, functioning or nonfunctioning adenomas), which account for 18% of cases.

Pregnancy must always be suspected with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea.

pituitary fossa, and Sheehan syndrome, caused by severe obstetric hemorrhage and/
or maternal hypotension at delivery, are important causes of atrophy and ischemia of
the pituitary. If suspected, they should be investigated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Finally, disorders such as premature ovarian failure (loss of all functional
ovarian follicles before the age of 40 years), diseases of the thyroid, and adult-onset
adrenal hyperplasia should be considered and investigated if supported by history
and physical examination with the appropriate laboratory studies (Table 12–1).
The history and physical examination will narrow the range of possible causes.
In this patient, the history of fatigue, weight gain, and galactorrhea, along with
previously normal menses and a normal physical examination, place hypothyroidism
at the top of the list. In primary hypothyroidism, the hypothalamus increases
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which also stimulates prolactin secretion.
Measurement of both thyroid hormone and prolactin levels would be indicated
in this case. Prolactinomas are the most common functional pituitary tumors in
both men and women, and should be suspected if the prolactin level is markedly
elevated, >200 μg/L. If prolactin levels are markedly elevated, pituitary imaging
with MRI is indicated. Hyperprolactinemia from any cause inhibits hypothalamic
GNrH secretion, leading to amenorrhea in women, and infertility and diminished
libido in men. In the workup of secondary amenorrhea, these two diagnoses are the
easiest to start with because the tests are noninvasive and relatively inexpensive.

HYPOTHYROIDISM
Hypothyroidism is defined as the insufficient production of thyroid hormone.
Secondary hypothyroidism as a result of dysfunction of hypothalamic and pituitary
hormone secretion is much less common but should be suspected in a patient with

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

121

a history suggestive of Sheehan syndrome or with symptoms or signs of a tumor in
the region of the sella. Ninety-five percent of cases of hypothyroidism are caused
by primary thyroid gland failure, resulting in insufficient thyroid hormone production.
In the United States, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is lymphocytic
(Hashimoto) thyroiditis, in which cytotoxic antibodies are produced, which leads
to thyroid atrophy and fibrosis. The next most common cause is surgical or radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism, or Graves disease. Worldwide, iodine
deficiency is the most common cause of goitrous (enlarged thyroid) hypothyroidism,
but in the United States, this is rare.
Most hypothyroid patients present with vague and nonspecific symptoms. Elderly
individuals may be suspected of having dementia or depression when the cause is
really hypothyroidism. In general, symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, muscle cramping, cold intolerance, hair thinning, menstrual changes, or carpal tunnel syndrome
are common and should prompt an investigation of thyroid function. In severe,
prolonged hypothyroidism, a syndrome termed myxedema may develop. These
patients present with dull facies, swollen eyes, and doughy extremities from the
accumulation of hydrophilic polysaccharides in the dermis, sparse hair, and a thickened tongue. They may have an enlarged heart, nonmechanical intestinal obstruction (ileus), and a delayed relaxation phase of their deep tendon reflexes. Without
treatment, they may become stuporous and hypothermic, especially if challenged
with an intercurrent illness. This is a life-threatening emergency with a high mortality, even when managed aggressively with intravenous levothyroxine.
When testing outpatients for hypothyroidism, measurement of the serum thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) level is the most sensitive and useful test. Because
almost all cases of hypothyroidism are caused by thyroid gland failure, the normal
pituitary response is to markedly increase the TSH levels in an attempt to stimulate
the failing gland. Falling levels of thyroid hormone produce logarithmic increases
in the TSH concentration. Measurement of TSH alone would be insufficient in
suspected cases of pituitary disease, so measurement of the thyroid hormone level
can also be performed. One should remember that almost all thyroxine (T4) circulates bound to protein, but it is the free or unbound fraction that is able to diffuse
into cells and become active. Most laboratories can now measure free T4 directly, or
it can be estimated by using the free thyroxine index (FTI). The FTI is calculated
from measurements of total T4 and the T3 resin uptake test. When there is excess
thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), as in pregnancy or oral contraceptive use, T4 levels
will be high (as a consequence of the large amount of carrier protein), but T3 uptake
will be low (value varies inversely with amount of TBG present). Conversely, when
there is a low level of TBG, as in a hypoproteinemic patient with nephrotic syndrome, the T4 level will necessarily also be low (not much carrier protein), but the
T3 uptake will be high. If both total T4 and T3 uptake are low, the FTI is low, and
the patient is hypothyroid.
In mild cases, or subclinical hypothyroidism, the TSH level is mildly elevated
(4-10 mU/L), but the free T4 or FTI is within the normal range. Patients may be
asymptomatic or report the vague and subtle symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as
fatigue. About half of such patients will progress to overt hypothyroidism within
5 years. They often have some derangement of cholesterol metabolism, such as

122

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

elevated total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Thyroid hormone
replacement can be prescribed in an attempt to relieve symptoms or possibly to
reduce cardiovascular risk, or if positive antithyroid antibodies are present.
In clinical hypothyroidism, the TSH level is markedly elevated, and the free
T4 or FTI is low. The overwhelming majority of patients with hypothyroidism can
be treated with once-daily dosing of synthetic levothyroxine, which is biochemically identical to the natural hormone. Levothyroxine is relatively inexpensive,
has a long half-life (6-7 days), allowing once-daily dosing, and gives a predictable
response. Older thyroid preparations, such as desiccated thyroid extract, are available but are not favored because they have a high content of T3, which is rapidly
absorbed and can produce tachyarrhythmias, and the T4 content is less predictable.
If there is no residual thyroid function, the daily replacement dose of levothyroxine is 1.6 μg/kg, or typically 100 to 150 μg. In older patients and in those
with known cardiovascular disease, dosing should start at a lower level, such as
25 to 50 μg/d, and be increased at similar increments once every 4 to 6 weeks until
the patient achieves a euthyroid state. Overly rapid replacement with the sudden
increase in metabolic rate can overwhelm the coronary or cardiac reserve. The goal
of treatment is normalized TSH, ideally in the lower half of the reference range. The
TSH level will take 6 to 8 weeks to readjust to a new dosing level, so follow-up
laboratory testing should be scheduled accordingly. Patients may not experience full
relief of symptoms until 3 to 6 months after normal TSH is achieved.

12.3 A 19-year-old gymnast active in national competition is brought to your clinic
by her mother because the daughter’s menses have ceased for the last 3 months.
Prior to this, she was always regular. She denies excess dieting, although she
does work out with her team 3 hours daily. Her physical examination is normal
except for her body mass index (BMI) of 20 kg/m2. Which of the following
laboratory tests should be ordered ﬁrst?
A. Thyroid function tests
B. Complete blood count
C. Luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
D. Prolactin
E. Beta-hCG
12.4 A 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 4 weeks ago
presents to your clinic complaining of persistent feelings of fatigue and sluggishness. After conﬁrming your diagnosis with a measurement of the TSH,
you started her on levothyroxine 50 μg daily. She has been reading about her
diagnosis on the Internet and wants to try desiccated thyroid extract instead of
the medicine you gave her. On examination, she weighs 175 lb, her heart rate
is 64 bpm at rest, and her blood pressure is normal. Which of the following is
the best next step?
A. Tell her that this delay in resolution of symptoms is normal and schedule
a follow-up visit with her in 2 months.
B. Change her medication, as requested, to thyroid extract and titrate.
C. Increase her dose of levothyroxine and have her come back in 4 weeks.
D. Tell her to start a multivitamin with iron to take with her levothyroxine.

ANSWERS
12.1 C. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism with
goiter in the United States. It is most commonly found in middle-aged women,
although it can be seen in all age groups. Patients can present with a rubbery,
nontender goiter that may have “scalloped” borders. Iodine deﬁciency is
exceedingly uncommon in the United States because of iodized salt. Graves
disease is a hyperthyroid condition. Patients with multinodular goiter usually
are euthyroid. Patients with thyroid cancer usually are euthyroid and have a
history of head and neck irradiation.
12.2 D. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease of the thyroid. Several
different autoantibodies directed toward components of the thyroid gland will
be present in the patient’s serum; however, of these, antithyroperoxidase antibody almost always is detectable (also called antimicrosomal antibody). These
antibodies are the markers, not the cause, of gland destruction. On thyroid
biopsy, lymphocytic inﬁltration and ﬁbrosis of the gland are pathognomonic.
The presence of these autoantibodies predicts progressive gland failure and the
need for hormone replacement. None of the other tests will be helpful.

124

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

12.3 E. In a young woman with oligomenorrhea, pregnancy should always be the
ﬁrst diagnosis considered. Urine pregnancy tests are easily performed in the
clinic and are highly sensitive. Serum beta-hCG can be measured to conﬁrm
a negative test. In this patient, the next most likely diagnosis is hypothalamic
hypogonadism, secondary to her strenuous exercise regimen. These young
women are at risk for osteoporosis and should be counseled on adequate nutrition and offered combined oral contraceptives if the amenorrhea persists.
12.4 C. Levothyroxine is the preferred replacement hormone for hypothyroidism.
The amount of hormone batch to batch and the patient dose response are
believed to be more predictable than with other forms of hormone replacement, such as thyroid extract, which is made from desiccated beef or pork
thyroid glands. There is no evidence that the natural hormone replacement is
superior to the synthetic form. The dose of levothyroxine should be titrated to
relief of symptoms, as well as to normalization of the TSH. Other medications,
especially iron-containing vitamins, should be taken at different times than
levothyroxine because they may interfere with absorption.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common causes of oligomenorrhea are disorders of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome
and hypothyroidism.



Hypothyroidism may cause hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia
from any cause induces hypothalamic dysfunction, leading to menstrual
irregularities in women, and diminished libido and infertility in men.



The most common cause of hypothyroidism is primary thyroid gland
failure as a result of Hashimoto thyroiditis.



A low free T4 or free thyroxine index and a high thyroid-stimulating hormone characterize primary hypothyroidism.



Synthetic levothyroxine (T4) replacement is the treatment of choice for
hypothyroidism; in older patients, you need to “start low and go slow.”



The goal of therapy is to normalize the thyroid-stimulating hormone level
in primary hypothyroidism and to relieve symptoms.

CASE 13
A 49-year-old woman presents to the ER complaining of a 4-week history of progressive abdominal swelling and discomfort. She has no other gastrointestinal
symptoms, and she has a normal appetite and normal bowel habits. Her medical
history is significant only for three pregnancies, one of which was complicated by
excessive blood loss, requiring a blood transfusion. She has been married and
monogamous for 20 years, exercises, does not smoke, and drinks only occasionally. On pointed questioning, however, she does admit that she was “wild” in her
youth, and she had snorted cocaine once or twice at parties many years ago. She
does not use drugs now. She was HIV negative at the time of the birth of her last
child.
On examination, her temperature is 100.3°F, heart rate 88 bpm, and blood pressure 94/60 mm Hg. She is thin, her complexion is sallow, her sclerae are icteric,
her chest is clear, and her heart rhythm is regular with no murmur. Her abdomen
is distended, with mild diffuse tenderness, hypoactive bowel sounds, shifting dullness to percussion, and a fluid wave. She has no peripheral edema. Laboratory
studies are normal except for Na 129 mEq/L (normal 135-145), albumin 2.8 g/dL
(normal 3.5-5 g/dL), total bilirubin 4 mg/dL, prothrombin time 15 seconds (normal
11-13.5 s), hemoglobin 12 g/dL with mean cell volume (MCV) 102 fL (normal 78-95),
and platelet count 78,000/mm3 (normal 150 000-500 000).

ANSWERS TO CASE 13:
Cirrhosis, Probable Hepatitis C–Related
Summary: A 49-year-old woman presents with new-onset abdominal swelling. Her
history reveals a blood transfusion and remote history of drug use. On examination,
her temperature is 100.3°F, heart rate 88 bpm, and blood pressure 94/60 mm Hg. Her
sclerae are icteric. Her abdomen is distended, with mild diffuse tenderness, shifting
dullness to percussion, and a fluid wave, consistent with ascites. She has no peripheral edema. Laboratory studies show the following levels: Na 129 mmol/L, albumin
2.8 g/dL, prothrombin time 15 seconds, hemoglobin 12 g/dL with MCV 102 fL, and
platelet count 78 000/mm3.
• Most likely diagnosis: Ascites caused by portal hypertension as a complication
of hepatic cirrhosis.
• Next step: Perform a paracentesis to evaluate the ascitic fluid to try to determine its likely etiology as well as evaluate for the complication of spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the causes of chronic hepatitis, especially hepatitis C virus (HCV).
2. Learn the complications of chronic hepatitis, such as cirrhosis and portal
hypertension.
3. Understand the utility of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) to
differentiate causes of ascites.
4. Know how to diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Considerations
This 49-year-old woman had been in good health until recently, when she noted
increasing abdominal swelling and discomfort, indicative of ascites. The physical
examination is consistent with ascites with the fluid wave and shifting dullness. Her
icterus suggests liver disease as the etiology of the ascites. Her laboratory studies are
significant for hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy (prolonged prothrombin time),
indicating probable impaired hepatic synthetic function and advanced liver disease.
She does have prior exposures, most notably a blood transfusion, which put her at
risk for hepatitis viruses, especially hepatitis C. Currently, she also has a low-grade
fever and mild abdominal tenderness, both signs of infection. Bacterial infection of
the ascitic fluid must be considered, because untreated cases have a high mortality.
Although the large majority of patients with ascites and jaundice have cirrhosis,
other etiologies of the ascites must be considered, including malignancy. Diagnostic
paracentesis can be used to assess for infection as well as to seek an etiology of the
ascites.

APPROACH TO:
Chronic Hepatitis
DEFINITIONS
ASCITES: Abnormal accumulation (>25 mL) of fluid within the peritoneal cavity.
CHRONIC HEPATITIS: Evidence of hepatic inflammation and necrosis for at
least 6 months.
CIRRHOSIS: Histologic diagnosis reflecting irreversible chronic hepatic injury,
which includes extensive fibrosis and formation of regenerative nodules.
PORTAL HYPERTENSION: Increased pressure gradient (>10 mm Hg) in the
portal vein, usually resulting from resistance to portal flow and most commonly
caused by cirrhosis.
SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS: Bacterial infection of ascitic
fluid without any intra-abdominal source of infection. Occurs in 10% to 20% of
cirrhotic patients with ascites.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Chronic hepatitis is diagnosed when patients have evidence of hepatic inflammation and necrosis (usually found by elevated transaminases) for at least 6 months.
The most common causes of chronic hepatitis are viral infections, such as hepatitis B and C, alcohol use, chronic exposure to other drugs or toxins, and autoimmune hepatitis. Less common causes are inherited metabolic disorders, such as
hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, or α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Table 13–1 lists the
diagnostic markers for these disorders.
Hepatitis C infection is most commonly acquired through percutaneous exposure to blood. Risk factors for acquisition of hepatitis C include intravenous drug
use, sharing of straws to snort cocaine, hemodialysis, blood transfusion, tattooing,
and piercing. In contrast to hepatitis B, sexual transmission is rare. Vertical transmission from mother to child is uncommon but occurs more often when the mother
has high viral titers or is HIV positive.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Most patients diagnosed with hepatitis C are asymptomatic and report no prior
history of acute hepatitis. The clinician must have a high index of suspicion and
offer screening to those individuals with risk factors for infection. To date, the best
methods for detecting infection include the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) test, which detects anti-HCV antibody (Ab), or the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) to detect HCV RNA. Approximately 70% to 80% of all patients
infected with hepatitis C will develop chronic hepatitis in the 10 years following
infection. Within 20 years, 20% of those will develop cirrhosis. Among those with
cirrhosis, 1% to 4% annually may develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Therapy is
directed toward reducing the viral load to prevent the sequelae of end-stage cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the treatment of choice
for chronic hepatitis C is combination therapy with pegylated alpha-interferon
and ribavirin. Trials have demonstrated a sustained response (undetectable viral
levels) in up to 75% to 80% of those with favorable HCV genotypes (types 2 and 3).
However, the therapy has many side effects, such as influenzalike symptoms and
depression with interferon, and hemolysis with ribavirin. The goal of interferon
therapy for hepatitis C is preventing the complications of chronic hepatitis.
Cirrhosis is the end result of chronic hepatocellular injury that leads to both
fibrosis and nodular regeneration. With ongoing hepatocyte destruction and
collagen deposition, the liver shrinks in size and becomes nodular and hard.
Alcoholic cirrhosis is one of the most common forms of cirrhosis encountered in
the United States. It is related to chronic alcohol use, but there appears to be some
hereditary predisposition to the development of fibrosis, and the process is enhanced
by concomitant infection with hepatitis C. Clinical symptoms are produced by the
hepatic dysfunction, as well as by portal hypertension (Table 13–2).
Loss of functioning hepatic mass leads to jaundice as well as impaired synthesis
of albumin (leading to edema) and of clotting factors (leading to coagulopathy).
Decreased liver production of steroid hormone binding globulin (SHBG) leads to
an increase in unbound estrogen manifested by spider angiomata, palmar erythema,
and testicular atrophy and gynecomastia in men.
Fibrosis and increased sinusoidal resistance lead to portal hypertension and its
complications. Esophageal and gastric varices are prone to bleeding, which may
produce massive hemorrhage, or more subtle bleeding that can trigger a bout of
encephalopathy. Treatment may include infusion of octreotide to cause splanchnic
vasoconstriction and reduce portal pressure. Esophageal varices can also be treated
endoscopically with ligation or banding to treat or prevent bleeding, or with sclerotherapy for active bleeding. Transjugular portal-systemic shunts (TIPS) may also be
placed to decompress portal pressure and reduce bleeding risk, but this carries a risk of
causing hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by mental status changes, asterixis, and elevated ammonia levels. It may be precipitated
by numerous factors including electrolyte disturbance, increased dietary protein
load (including digestion of blood), or infection. Treatment is aimed at correcting
underlying causes, as well as administration of lactulose, a nonabsorbable disaccharide that causes colonic acidification and elimination of nitrogenous waste. Poorly
absorbed antibiotics such as neomycin may also be administered orally as adjunctive
treatment.

The most common cause of ascites is portal hypertension as a consequence
of cirrhosis. Ascites may be a result of exudative causes such as infection (eg,
tuberculous peritonitis) or malignancy. It is important to try to determine the
cause of ascites in order to look for reversible causes and for serious causes, such
as malignancy, and to guide therapy. Ascitic fluid is obtained by paracentesis and
examined for protein, albumin, cell count with differential, and culture. The
first step in trying to determine the cause of ascites (Table 13–3) is to determine
whether it is caused by portal hypertension or by an exudative process by calculating the SAAG:
Serum-ascites albumin gradient = serum albumin − ascitic albumin

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

The treatment of ascites usually consists of dietary sodium restriction coupled
with diuretics. Loop diuretics are often combined with spironolactone to provide
effective diuresis and to maintain normal potassium levels. Spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis is a relatively common complication of ascites, thought to be caused
by translocation of gut flora into the peritoneal fluid. Symptoms include fever and
abdominal pain, but often there is paucity of signs and symptoms. Diagnosis is established by paracentesis and finding more than 250 neutrophils/mm3 or by a positive
culture. Culture of ascitic fluid often fails to yield the organism. However, fluid
cultures, when positive, usually reveal a single organism, most often gram-negative
enteric flora but occasionally enterococci or pneumococci. This is in contrast to
secondary peritonitis, for example, as a consequence of intestinal perforation, which
usually is polymicrobial. Empiric therapy includes coverage for gram-positive cocci
and gram-negative rods, such as intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin, or a thirdgeneration cephalosporin or a quinolone antibiotic.
Other complications of advanced cirrhosis include hepatorenal syndrome, which
typically presents as progressive decline in renal function in patients with significant ascites. Pathogenesis is poorly understood, but appears to involve multifactorial
renal vasoconstriction. Treatment is difficult, and prognosis is often poor, unless
patients proceed for liver transplant.
Patients being considered for transplant are stratified according to scoring
systems to estimate disease severity and survival. The Model for End-stage Liver
Disease (MELD) score uses a patient’s laboratory values for serum bilirubin, serum
creatinine, and the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR)
to predict survival. An older scoring system, the Child-Pugh system, also classifies
severity of disease, with class A having the best prognosis and class C the worst.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
13.1 E. Idiopathic or autoimmune hepatitis is a less-well-understood cause of
hepatitis that seems to be caused by autoimmune cell-mediated damage to
hepatocytes. A subgroup of these patients includes young women with positive
ANAs and hypergammaglobulinemia who may have other symptoms and
signs of systemic lupus erythematosus.
13.2 B. Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism. Progressive iron
overload leads to organ destruction. Diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis of the liver,
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, arthropathy, and cardiomyopathy are among
the more common end-stage developments. Skin deposition of iron leads to
“bronzing” of the skin, which could be mistaken for a tan. Diagnosis is made
early in the course of disease by demonstrating elevated iron stores but can
be made through liver biopsy with iron stains. Genetic testing is available.
Therapy involves phlebotomy to remove excess iron stores.
13.3 D. Sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune destruction of both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and often is associated with inﬂammatory
bowel disease, most commonly ulcerative colitis. Patients present with jaundice
or symptoms of biliary obstruction; cholangiography reveals the characteristic
beading of the bile ducts.
13.4 C. Primary biliary cirrhosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease leading to
destruction of small- to medium-size bile ducts. Most patients are women between
the ages of 35 and 60 years, who usually present with symptoms of pruritus and
fatigue. Alkaline phosphatase elevated two to ﬁve times above the baseline
should raise suspicion; diagnosis is conﬁrmed with antimitochondrial Ab.
13.5 A. Wilson disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The inability
to excrete excess copper leads to deposition of the mineral in the liver, brain,
and other organs. Patients can present with fulminant hepatitis, acute nonfulminant hepatitis, or cirrhosis, or with bizarre behavioral changes as a result
of neurologic damage. Kayser-Fleischer rings develop when copper is released
from the liver and deposits in Descemet membrane of the cornea.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common causes of cirrhosis are alcohol use, hepatitis B and C,
and autoimmune disorders.



Hepatitis C is most commonly contracted through blood exposure and
rarely through sexual contact. Most patients are asymptomatic until they
develop complications of chronic liver disease.



A serum ascites albumin gradient more than 1.1 g/dL suggests that ascites is caused by portal hypertension, as occurs in cirrhosis.



Treatment of cirrhotic ascites requires sodium restriction and, usually,
diuretics, such as spironolactone and furosemide.



Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is infection of the ascitic fluid characterized by more than 250 polymorphonuclear cells/mm3, sometimes with
a positive monomicrobial culture.

CASE 14
A 42-year-old Hispanic woman presents to the ED complaining of 24 hours of
severe, steady epigastric abdominal pain, radiating to her back, with several
episodes of nausea and vomiting. She has experienced similar painful episodes
in the past, usually in the evening following heavy meals, but the episodes always
resolved spontaneously within an hour or two. This time the pain did not improve,
so she sought medical attention. She has no medical history and takes no medications. She is married, has three children, and does not drink alcohol or smoke
cigarettes.
On examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood
pressure 115/74 mm Hg, and shallow respirations of 22 breaths per minute. She
is moving uncomfortably on the stretcher, her skin is warm and diaphoretic, and
she has scleral icterus. Her abdomen is soft, mildly distended with marked rightupper quadrant and epigastric tenderness to palpation, hypoactive bowel sounds,
and no masses or organomegaly appreciated. Her stool is negative for occult
blood. Laboratory studies are significant for a total bilirubin (9.2 g/dL) with a direct
fraction of 4.8 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase 285 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) 78 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 92 IU/L, and elevated amylase level
1249 IU/L. Her leukocyte count is 16,500/mm3 with 82% polymorphonuclear cells
and 16% lymphocytes. A plain film of the abdomen shows a nonspecific gas pattern and no pneumoperitoneum.

ANSWERS TO CASE 14:
Pancreatitis, Gallstones
Summary: A 42-year-old woman with a prior history consistent with symptomatic
cholelithiasis now presents with epigastric pain and nausea for 24 hours, much longer than would be expected with uncomplicated biliary colic. Her symptoms are
consistent with acute pancreatitis. She also has hyperbilirubinemia and an elevated
alkaline phosphatase level, suggesting obstruction of the common bile duct caused
by a gallstone, which is the likely cause of her pancreatitis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis
• Most likely etiology: Choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stone)
• Next diagnostic step: Right-upper quadrant abdominal ultrasonography

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the causes, clinical features, and prognostic factors in acute pancreatitis.
2. Learn the principles of treatment and complications of acute pancreatitis.
3. Know the complications of gallstones.
4. Understand the medical treatment of a patient with biliary sepsis and the indications for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgical
intervention.

Considerations
This 42-year-old woman complained of episodes of mild right-upper quadrant
abdominal pain with heavy meals in the past. These prior episodes were short-lived.
This is very consistent with biliary colic. However, this episode is different in severity and location of pain (now radiating straight to her back and accompanied by
nausea and vomiting). The elevated amylase level confirms the clinical impression
of acute pancreatitis. She likely has acute pancreatitis caused by a stone in the common bile duct. Biliary obstruction is suggested by the elevated bilirubin level. She is
moderately ill but is hemodynamically stable and has only one prognostic feature to
predict mortality—her elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (Table 14–1). She
likely can be managed on a hospital ward without the need for intensive care.

APPROACH TO:
Acute Pancreatitis
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE PANCREATITIS: An inflammatory process in which pancreatic
enzymes are activated and cause autodigestion of the gland.
PANCREATIC PSEUDOCYST: Cystic space within the pancreas not lined by
epithelial cells, often associated with chronic pancreatitis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Acute pancreatitis can be caused by many conditions, but in most series, gallstones
are the most common cause (30%-60% of cases), usually due to passage of a gallstone
into the common bile duct. Alcohol use is next most common cause (15%-30% of cases
in the US) with episodes often precipitated by binge drinking. Hypertriglyceridemia
is another common cause (1%-4% of cases) and occurs when serum triglyceride levels are more than 1000 mg/dL, as is seen in patients with familial dyslipidemias or
diabetes (etiologies are given in Table 14–2). Acute pancreatitis can be induced by
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), occurring after 5% to
10% of such procedures. When patients appear to have “idiopathic” pancreatitis,
that is, no gallstones are seen on ultrasonography and no other pre-disposing factor
can be found, biliary tract disease is still the most likely cause—either biliary sludge
(microlithiasis) or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
Abdominal pain is the cardinal symptom of pancreatitis and often is severe,
typically in the upper abdomen with radiation to the back. The pain often is
relieved by sitting up and bending forward, and is exacerbated by food. Patients
commonly experience nausea and vomiting that is precipitated by oral intake.

138

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Table 14–2 • CAUSES OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS
Biliary tract disease (eg, gallstones)
Alcohol use
Drugs (eg, the antiretroviral didanosine [DDI], pentamidine, thiazides, furosemide, sulfonamides,
azathioprine, L-asparaginase)
Surgical manipulation of the gland, or ERCP
Hypertriglyceridemia/hypercalcemia
Infections such as mumps or cytomegalovirus
Trauma such as blunt abdominal trauma

They may have low-grade fever (if temperature is >101°F, one should suspect infection) and often are volume depleted because of the vomiting and inability to tolerate
oral intake, and because the inflammatory process may cause third spacing with
sequestration of large volumes of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis with blood tracking along fascial planes would be suspected if periumbilical
ecchymosis (Cullen’s sign) or flank ecchymosis (Grey Turner’s sign) is present.
The most common test used to diagnose pancreatitis is an elevated serum amylase
level. It is released from the inflamed pancreas within hours of the attack and remains
elevated for 3 to 4 days. Amylase undergoes renal clearance, and after serum levels
decline, its level remains elevated in the urine. Amylase is not specific to the
pancreas, however, and can be elevated as a consequence of many other abdominal
processes, such as gastrointestinal ischemia with infarction or perforation; even
just the vomiting associated with pancreatitis can cause elevated amylase of salivary
origin. Elevated serum lipase level, also seen in acute pancreatitis, is more specific
than is amylase to pancreatic origin and remains elevated longer than does amylase. When the diagnosis is uncertain or when complications of pancreatitis are suspected, computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the abdomen is highly sensitive for
showing the inflammatory changes in patients with moderate to severe pancreatitis.
Treatment of pancreatitis is mainly supportive and includes “pancreatic rest,”
that is, withholding food or liquids by mouth until symptoms subside, and adequate
narcotic analgesia, usually with meperidine. Intravenous fluids are necessary for
maintenance and to replace any deficits. In patients with severe pancreatitis who
sequester large volumes of fluid in their abdomen as pancreatic ascites, sometimes
prodigious amounts of parenteral fluid replacement are necessary to maintain intravascular volume. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with
papillotomy to remove bile duct stones may lessen the severity of gallstone pancreatitis, and is usually done within 72 hours. When pain has largely subsided and the
patient has bowel sounds, oral clear liquids can be started and the diet advanced as
tolerated.
The large majority of patients with acute pancreatitis will recover spontaneously
and have a relatively uncomplicated course. Several scoring systems have been
developed in an attempt to identify the 15% to 25% of patients who will have a
more complicated course. When three or more of the Ranson criteria are present
(Table 14–1), a severe course complicated by pancreatic necrosis can be predicted.
The most common cause of early death in patients with pancreatitis is hypovolemic

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

139

shock, which is multifactorial: third spacing and sequestration of large fluid volumes in the abdomen, as well as increased capillary permeability. Others develop
pulmonary edema, which may be noncardiogenic due to acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), or cardiogenic as a consequence of myocardial dysfunction.
Pancreatic complications include a phlegmon, which is a solid mass of inflamed
pancreas, often with patchy areas of necrosis. Sometimes, extensive areas of pancreatic necrosis develop within a phlegmon. Either necrosis or a phlegmon can become
secondarily infected, resulting in pancreatic abscess. Abscesses typically develop
2 to 3 weeks after the onset of illness and should be suspected if there is fever or
leukocytosis. If pancreatic abscesses are not drained, mortality approaches 100%.
Pancreatic necrosis and abscess are the leading causes of death in patients after the
first week of illness. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a cystic collection of inflammatory
fluid and pancreatic secretions, which unlike true cysts do not have an epithelial
lining. Most pancreatic pseudocysts resolve spontaneously within 6 weeks, especially
if they are smaller than 6 cm. However, if they are causing pain, are large or expanding,
or become infected, they usually require drainage. Any of these local complications of
pancreatitis should be suspected if persistent pain, fever, abdominal mass, or persistent
hyperamylasemia occurs.

Gallstones
Gallstones usually form as a consequence of precipitation of cholesterol microcrystals in bile. They are very common, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients older than
65 years. Patients often are asymptomatic. When discovered incidentally, they can
be followed without intervention, as only 10% of patients will develop any symptoms related to their stones within 10 years. When patients do develop symptoms
because of a stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann pouch, the typical attack of
biliary colic usually has a sudden onset, often precipitated by a large or fatty meal,
with severe steady pain in the right-upper quadrant or epigastrium, lasting between
1 and 4 hours. They may have mild elevations of the alkaline phosphatase level and
slight hyperbilirubinemia, but elevations of the bilirubin level over 3 g/dL suggest a
common duct stone. The first diagnostic test in a patient with suspected gallstones
usually is an ultrasonogram. The test is noninvasive and very sensitive for detecting stones in the gallbladder as well as intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct
dilation.
One of the most common complications of gallstones is acute cholecystitis,
which occurs when a stone becomes impacted in the cystic duct, and edema and
inflammation develop behind the obstruction. This is apparent ultrasonographically
as gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, and is characterized clinically as a persistent right-upper quadrant abdominal pain, with fever and leukocytosis.
Cultures of bile in the gallbladder often yield enteric flora such as Escherichia coli
and Klebsiella. If the diagnosis is in question, nuclear scintigraphy with a hepatobiliary
iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan may be performed. The positive test shows visualization of the liver by the isotope, but nonvisualization of the gallbladder may
indicate an obstructed cystic duct. Treatment of acute cholecystitis usually involves
making the patient nil per os (NPO), intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and early
cholecystectomy within 48 to 72 hours.

140

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Another complication of gallstones is cholangitis, which occurs when there is
intermittent obstruction of the common bile duct, allowing reflux of bacteria up
the biliary tree, followed by development of purulent infection behind the obstruction. If the patient is septic, the condition requires urgent decompression of the
biliary tree, either surgically or by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP), to remove the stones endoscopically after performing a papillotomy, which
allows the other stones to pass.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
14.1 A 43-year-old man who is an alcoholic is admitted to the hospital with acute
pancreatitis. He is given intravenous hydration and is placed NPO. Which of
the following ﬁndings is a poor prognostic sign?
A. His age
B. Initial serum glucose level of 60 mg/dL
C. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level rises 7 mg/dL over 48 hours
D. Hematocrit drops 3%
E. Amylase level of 1000 IU/L
14.2 A 37-year-old woman is noted to have gallstones on ultrasonography. She is
placed on a low-fat diet. After 3 months she is noted to have severe rightupper quadrant pain, fever to 102°F, and nausea. Which of the following is the
most likely diagnosis?
A. Acute cholangitis
B. Acute cholecystitis
C. Acute pancreatitis
D. Acute perforation of the gallbladder
14.3 A 45-year-old man was admitted for acute pancreatitis, thought to be a result
of blunt abdominal trauma. After 3 months he still has epigastric pain but is
able to eat solid food. His amylase level is elevated at 260 IU/L. Which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Recurrent pancreatitis
B. Diverticulitis
C. Peptic ulcer disease
D. Pancreatic pseudocyst

ANSWERS
14.1 C. When the BUN rises by 5 mg/dL after 48 hours despite IV hydration, it is a
poor prognostic sign. Notably, the amylase level does not correlate to the severity of the disease. An elevated serum glucose would be a poor prognostic factor.
A drop in hematocrit of at least 10% is a signiﬁcant poor prognostic criterion.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

141

14.2 B. Acute cholecystitis is one of the most common complications of gallstones.
This patient with fever, right-upper quadrant pain, and a history of gallstones
likely has acute cholecystitis.
14.3 D. A pancreatic pseudocyst has a clinical presentation of abdominal pain and
mass and persistent hyperamylasemia in a patient with prior pancreatitis.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The three most common causes of acute pancreatitis in the United States
are gallstones, alcohol consumption, and hypertriglyceridemia.



Acute pancreatitis usually is managed with pancreatic rest, intravenous
hydration, and analgesia, often with narcotics.



Patients with pancreatitis who have zero to two of the Ranson criteria are
expected to have a mild course; those with three or more criteria can have
significant mortality.



Pancreatic complications (phlegmon, necrosis, abscess, pseudocyst) should
be suspected if persistent pain, fever, abdominal mass, or persistent hyperamylasemia occurs.



Patients with asymptomatic gallstones do not require treatment; they
can be observed and treated if symptoms develop. Cholecystectomy is
performed for patients with symptoms of biliary colic or for those with
complications.



Acute cholecystitis is best treated with antibiotics and then cholecystectomy,
generally within 48 to 72 hours.

CASE 15
A 72-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after fainting while in church.
He had stood up to sing a hymn and then fell to the floor. His wife, who witnessed
the episode, reports that he was unconscious for approximately 2 or 3 minutes.
When he awakened, he was groggy for another minute or two, and then seemed
himself. No abnormal movements were noted. This has never happened to him
before, but his wife does report that for the last several months he has had to
curtail activities, such as mowing the lawn, because he becomes weak and feels
light-headed. His only medical history is osteoarthritis of his knees, for which he
takes acetaminophen.
On examination, he is alert, talkative, and smiling. He is afebrile, his heart rate
is regular at 35 bpm, and his blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg, which remains
unchanged on standing. He has contusions on his face, left arm, and chest wall,
but no lacerations. His chest is clear to auscultation, and his heart rhythm is regular but bradycardic with a nondisplaced apical impulse. He has no focal deficits.
Laboratory examination shows normal blood counts, renal function, and serum
electrolyte levels, and negative cardiac enzymes. His ECG (electrocardiogram) is
shown in Figure 15–1.

ANSWERS TO CASE 15:
Syncope—Heart Block
Summary: A 72-year-old man presents with a witnessed syncopal episode, which was
brief and not associated with seizure activity. He has experienced decreasing exercise
tolerance recently because of weakness and presyncopal symptoms. He is bradycardic,
with third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block on ECG. Arrows in Figure 15–1 point
to P waves.
• Most likely diagnosis: Syncope as a consequence of third-degree AV block
• Next step: Placement of temporary transcutaneous or transvenous pacemaker
and evaluation for placement of a permanent pacemaker

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the major causes of syncope and important historical clues to the diagnosis.
2. Understand the basic evaluation of syncope based on the history.
3. Recognize vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus hypersensitivity.
4. Be able to diagnose and know the management of first-, second-, and thirddegree AV block.

Considerations
There are two major considerations to the management of this patient: the cause
and the management of his AV block. He should be evaluated for myocardial infarction and structural cardiac abnormalities. If this evaluation is negative, he may simply have conduction system disease as a consequence of aging. Regarding temporary
management, atropine or isoproterenol can be used when the conduction block is
at the level of the AV node, but in this case, the heart rate is less than 40 bpm, and
the QRS borderline is widened, suggesting the defect is below the AV node, in the
bundles of His. A pacemaker likely is required.

APPROACH TO:
Syncope
DEFINITIONS
SYNCOPE: A transient loss of consciousness and postural tone with subsequent
spontaneous recovery.
VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: Fainting due to excessive vagal tone causing impaired
autonomic responses such as hypotension without appropriate rise in heart rate or
vasomotor tone.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

145

CLINICAL APPROACH
Syncope is a very common phenomenon, resulting in 5% to 10% of emergency center visits and subsequent hospitalization. The causes are varied, but they all result in
transiently diminished cerebral perfusion leading to loss of consciousness. The prognosis is quite varied, ranging from a benign episode in an otherwise young, healthy
person with a clear precipitating event, such as emotional stress, to a more serious
occurrence in an older patient with cardiac disease. In the latter situation, syncope
has been referred to as “sudden cardiac death, averted.” For that reason, higher risk
patients routinely undergo hospitalization and sometimes extensive evaluation to
determine the cause.
Traditionally, the etiologies of syncope have been divided into neurologic and cardiac. However, this probably is not a useful classification, because neurologic diseases
are uncommon causes of syncopal episodes. Syncope is essentially never a result of
transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), because syncope reflects global cerebral hypoperfusion, and TIAs are a result of regional ischemia. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency with
resultant loss of consciousness is often discussed yet rarely seen in clinical practice.
Seizure episodes are a common cause of transient loss of consciousness, and distinguishing seizure episodes from syncopal episodes based on history often is quite difficult. Loss of consciousness associated with seizure typically lasts longer than 5 minutes,
with a prolonged postictal period, whereas patients with syncope usually become reoriented quickly. To further complicate matters, the same lack of cerebral blood flow that
produced the loss of consciousness can lead to postsyncopal seizure activity. Seizures
are best discussed elsewhere, so our discussion here is confined to syncope.
The only neurologic diseases that commonly cause syncope are disturbances
in autonomic function leading to orthostatic hypotension as occurs in diabetes,
parkinsonism, or idiopathic dysautonomia. For patients in whom a definitive diagnosis of syncope can be ascertained, the causes usually are excess vagal activity,
orthostatic hypotension, or cardiac disease—either arrhythmias or outflow obstructions. Table 15–1 lists the most common causes of syncope. By far, the most useful
evaluation for diagnosing the cause of syncope is the patient’s history. Because,
by definition, the patient was unconscious, the patient may only be able to report
preceding and subsequent symptoms, so finding a witness to describe the episode is
extremely helpful.
Vasovagal syncope refers to excessive vagal tone causing impaired autonomic
responses, that is, a fall in blood pressure without appropriate rise in heart rate or
vasomotor tone. This is, by far, the most common cause of syncope and is the usual
cause of a “fainting spell” in an otherwise healthy young person. Episodes often are
precipitated by physical or emotional stress, or by a painful experience. There is usually a clear precipitating event by history and, often, prodromal symptoms such as
nausea, yawning, or diaphoresis. The episodes are brief, lasting seconds to minutes,
with a rapid recovery. Syncopal episodes also can be triggered by physiologic activities that increase vagal tone, such as micturition, defecation, or coughing in otherwise healthy people. Vasovagal syncope needs to be differentiated from orthostatic
hypotension.
Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is also vagally mediated. This usually occurs in
older men, and episodes can be triggered by turning the head to the side, by wearing

Table 15–1 • CAUSES OF SYNCOPE
CARDIOGENIC
Cardiac arrhythmias
• Bradyarrhythmias
• Sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, sinus arrest, sick sinus syndrome
• Atrioventricular block
• Tachyarrhythmias
• Supraventricular tachycardia with structural cardiac disease
• Atrial fibrillation associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
• Atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction
• Ventricular tachycardia
Other cardiopulmonary etiologies
• Pulmonary embolism
• Pulmonary hypertension
• Atrial myxoma
• Myocardial disease (massive myocardial infarction)
• Left ventricular myocardial restriction or constriction
• Pericardial constriction or tamponade
• Aortic outflow tract obstruction (aortic valvular stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy)
NONCARDIOGENIC
Vasovagal (vasodepressor, neurocardiogenic)
Postural (orthostatic) hypotension
• Drug induced (especially antihypertensive or vasodilator drugs)
• Peripheral neuropathy (diabetic, alcoholic, nutritional, amyloid)
• Idiopathic postural hypotension
• Neurologic disorder (Shy-Drager syndrome)
• Physical deconditioning
• Sympathectomy
• Acute dysautonomia (Guillain-Barré syndrome variant)
• Decreased blood volume (adrenal insufficiency, acute blood loss, etc)
• Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
Situational
• Cough, Valsalva
• Micturition, defecation
• Hypoglycemia
• Generalized anxiety, panic disorder, somatization

a tight collar, or even by shaving the neck over the area. Pressure over one or both
carotid sinuses causes excess vagal activity with resultant cardiac slowing and can
produce sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, or even AV block. Less commonly, carotid
sinus pressure can cause a fall in arterial pressure without cardiac slowing. When
recurrent syncope as a result of bradyarrhythmias occurs, a demand pacemaker is
often required.
Patients with orthostatic hypotension typically report symptoms related to positional changes, such as rising from a seated or recumbent position, and the postural
drop in systolic blood pressure by more than 20 mm Hg can be demonstrated on
examination. This can occur because of hypovolemia (hemorrhage, anemia, diarrhea
or vomiting, Addison disease) or with adequate circulating volume but impaired
autonomic responses. The most common reason for this autonomic impairment

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

147

probably is iatrogenic as a result of antihypertensive or other medications, especially
in elderly persons. It also can be caused by autonomic insufficiency seen in diabetic
neuropathy, in a syndrome of chronic idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in older
men, or the primary neurologic conditions mentioned previously. Multiple events
that all are unwitnessed (not corroborated) or that occur only in periods of emotional upset suggest factitious symptoms.
Etiologies of cardiogenic syncope include rhythm disturbances and structural
heart abnormalities. Certain structural heart abnormalities will cause obstruction of
blood flow to the brain, resulting in syncope. These include aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Syncope due to cardiac outflow
obstruction can also occur with massive pulmonary embolism and severe pulmonary
hypertension. Syncope caused by cardiac outflow obstruction typically presents during or immediately after exertion. An echocardiogram often is obtained to elucidate
such abnormalities.
Arrhythmias, usually bradyarrhythmias, are the most common cardiac cause
of syncope. Sinus bradycardia most often due to degenerative sinoatrial node dysfunction and AV node blocks (see section on Heart Block) are bradyarrhythmic causes of
syncope. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in elderly patients is one of the most common
causes for pacemaker placement. Patients with SSS may experience sinus bradycardia
or arrest, alternating with a supraventricular tachycardia, most often atrial fibrillation (tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). Tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation
or flutter, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT), or
ventricular fibrillation (VF) are more likely to produce palpitations than syncope.
Often, the rhythm abnormality is apparent by routine ECG, or, if it occurs paroxysmally, it can be recorded using a 24-hour Holter monitor or an event monitor.
Sometimes evaluation requires invasive electrophysiologic studies to assess sinus
node or AV node function or to induce supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias.

Heart Block
There are three types of AV node block, all based on ECG findings. First-degree
AV block is a prolonged PR interval longer than 200 ms (>1 large box). This is a
conduction delay in the AV node. Prognosis is good, and there is usually no need for
pacing. Second-degree AV block comes in two types. Mobitz type I (Wenckebach)
is a progressive lengthening of the PR interval, until a dropped beat is produced.
The resulting P wave of the dropped beat is not followed by a QRS complex. This
phenomenon is caused by abnormal conduction in the AV node and may be the
result of inferior myocardial infarction. Prognosis is good, and there is generally no
need for pacing unless the patient is symptomatic (ie, bradycardia, syncope, heart
failure, asystole >3 seconds). On the other hand, Mobitz type II produces dropped
beats without lengthening of the PR interval. This is usually caused by a block
within the bundle of His. Permanent pacing is often indicated in these patients
because the Mobitz type II AV block may later progress to complete heart block.
Third-degree AV block is a complete heart block, where the sinoatrial (SA) node
and AV node fire at independent rates. The atrial rhythm is faster than the ventricular escape rhythm. Permanent pacing is indicated in these patients, especially when
associated with symptoms such as exercise intolerance or syncope.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
15.1 An 18-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room because she fainted
at a rock concert. She apparently recovered spontaneously, did not exhibit any
seizure activity, and has no medical history. Her heart rate is 90 bpm and blood

D. Reassure the patient and discharge home.
15.2 A 67-year-old woman has diabetes and mild hypertension. She is noted to
have some diabetic retinopathy, and she states that she cannot feel her legs.
She has recurrent episodes of lightheadedness when she gets up in the morning. She comes in now because she had fainted this morning. Which of the
following is the most likely cause of her syncope?
A. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
B. Pulmonary embolism
C. Autonomic neuropathy
D. Critical aortic stenosis
15.3 A 74-year-old man with no prior medical problems faints while shaving. He

the following is the best next step?
A. Atropine
B. Transvenous pacer
C. Lidocaine
D. Observation

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

149

ANSWERS
15.1 D. A young patient without a medical history and with no seizure activity with
a history suggestive of emotionally mediated vasovagal syncope has an excellent prognosis.
15.2 C. This diabetic patient has evidence of microvascular disease, including
peripheral neuropathy, and likely has autonomic dysfunction.
15.3 A. He likely has carotid hypersensitivity; thus, careful carotid massage (after
auscultation to ensure no bruits are present) may be given in an attempt to
reproduce the symptoms.
15.4 A. This patient’s bradycardia is severe, probably a result of the inferior myocardial infarction. Atropine is the agent of choice in this situation. Mobitz type I
block has a good prognosis (vs complete heart block), so transvenous pacing is
not usually required.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope in healthy
young people. It often has a precipitating event, prodromal symptoms,
and an excellent prognosis.



Carotid sinus hypersensitivity causes bradyarrhythmias in older patients
with pressure over the carotid bulb and sometimes requires a pacemaker.



Syncope caused by cardiac outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis,
occurs during or after exertion.



Syncope is a very common problem, affecting nearly one-third of the
adult population at some point, but a specific cause is identified in less
than half of cases.



Permanent pacing usually is indicated for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias (eg, sick sinus syndrome), Mobitz II atrioventricular block, or thirddegree heart block.

CASE 16
A 28-year-old man comes to the emergency room complaining of 2 days of abdominal pain and diarrhea. He describes his stools as frequent, with 10 to 12 per day,
small volume, sometimes with visible blood and mucus, and preceded by a sudden
urge to defecate. The abdominal pain is crampy, diffuse, and moderately severe,
and it is not relieved with defecation. In the past 6 to 8 months, he has experienced
similar episodes of abdominal pain and loose mucoid stools with some bleeding, but the episodes were milder and resolved within 24 to 48 hours. He has no
other medical history and takes no medications. He has neither traveled out of the
United States nor had contact with anyone with similar symptoms. He works as
an accountant and does not smoke or drink alcohol. No member of his family has
gastrointestinal (GI) problems.
On examination, his temperature is 99°F, heart rate 98 bpm, and blood pressure 118/74 mm Hg. He appears uncomfortable and is lying still on the stretcher.
His sclerae are anicteric, and his oral mucosa is pink and clear without ulceration.
His chest is clear, and his heart rhythm is regular, without murmurs. His abdomen
is soft and mildly distended, with hypoactive bowel sounds and minimal diffuse
tenderness but no guarding or rebound tenderness.
Laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15 800/mm3
with 82% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, and platelet
count 754 000/mm3. The HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) assay is negative.
Renal function and liver function tests are normal. A plain film radiograph of the
abdomen shows a mildly dilated air-filled colon with a 4.5-cm diameter and no
pneumoperitoneum or air/fluid levels.

ANSWERS TO CASE 16:
Ulcerative Colitis
Summary: A 28-year-old man comes in with a moderate to severe presentation of
colitis, as manifested by crampy abdominal pain with tenesmus, low-volume bloody
mucoid stool, and colonic dilatation on x-ray. He has no travel or exposure history
to suggest infection. He reports a history of previous similar episodes, which suggests
a chronic inflammatory rather than acute infectious process.
• Most likely diagnosis: Colitis, probably ulcerative colitis.
• Next step: Admit to the hospital, obtain stool samples to exclude infection,
and begin therapy with corticosteroids.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the typical presentation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
2. Know the differences between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.
3. Know the treatment of IBD.

Considerations
Although the likelihood is low, infection must be excluded, and it is necessary to
check for infections with organisms such as Entamoeba histolytica, Salmonella, Shigella, E coli, and Campylobacter, as well as Clostridium difficile, which can occur in the
absence of prior antibiotic exposure. The main consideration in this case would be
IBD versus infectious colitis. The absence of travel history, sick contacts, and the
chronicity of the illness all point away from infection.
At the moment, the patient does not appear to have any life-threatening complication of colitis, such as perforation or toxic megacolon, but he must be monitored
closely, and surgical consultation may be helpful. The combination of abdominal
pain, bloody diarrhea, and the abdominal x-ray localizing the disease to the colon
points to a “colitis.”

APPROACH TO:
Colitis
DEFINITIONS
COLITIS: Inflammation of the colon, which may be due to infectious, autoimmune, ischemic, or idiopathic causes.
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Autoimmune-mediated intestinal inflammation primarily due to either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

153

CLINICAL APPROACH
The differential diagnosis for colitis includes ischemic colitis, infectious colitis
(C difficile, E coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter), radiation colitis, and IBD
(Crohn disease vs ulcerative colitis). Mesenteric ischemia usually is encountered in
people older than 50 years with known atherosclerotic vascular disease or other cause
of hypoperfusion. The pain usually is acute in onset following a meal (“intestinal
angina”) and not associated with fevers. Infectious colitis is usually characterized by
an acute onset of symptoms, often in patients with a recent history of foreign travel,
or recent use of antibiotics.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is most commonly diagnosed in young
patients between the ages of 15 and 25 years. There is a second peak in the
incidence of IBD (usually Crohn disease) between the ages of 60 and 70 years. IBD
may present with a low-grade fever. The chronic nature of this patient’s disease
(several months) is typical of IBD. Anemia may be present, either due to iron
deficiency from chronic GI blood loss, or anemia of chronic disease. Patients with
IBD may also report fatigue and weight loss.
Ulcerative colitis usually presents with grossly bloody stool, whereas symptoms
of Crohn disease are much more variable, mainly chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea,
and weight loss. Ulcerative colitis involves only the large bowel, whereas Crohn
disease may affect any portion of the GI tract, typically the colon and terminal
ileum. Ulcerative colitis always begins in the rectum and proceeds proximally in a
continuous pattern; disease is limited to the colon. Crohn disease classically involves
the terminal ileum but may occur anywhere in the GI tract from the mouth to the
anus. Anal fissures and nonhealing ulcers are often seen in Crohn disease. Additionally, the pattern of Crohn disease is not contiguous in the GI tract; classically,
it has a patchy distribution that is often referred to as “skip lesions.” Patients with
Crohn disease may develop strictures caused by fibrosis from repeated inflammation which can lead to bowel obstruction, with crampy abdominal pain and nausea/
vomiting. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by diarrhea and typically leads to bowel
obstruction. The diagnosis usually is confirmed after colonoscopy with biopsy of
the affected segments of bowel and histologic examination. In ulcerative colitis,
inflammation will be limited to the mucosa and submucosa, whereas in Crohn
disease, the inflammation will be transmural (throughout all layers of the bowel).
Tables 16–1 and 16–2 list further clinical features. Surgery is indicated for complications of Crohn disease, such as obstruction, fistulas, or perforation, but recurrent
disease is common.

Crohn Disease Versus Ulcerative Colitis
The treatment of ulcerative colitis can be complex because the pathophysiology of the disease is incompletely understood. Management is aimed at reducing
the inflammation. Most commonly, sulfasalazine and other 5-aminosalicylic acid
(ASA) compounds such as mesalamine are used and are available in oral and rectal
preparations. They are used in mild to moderate active disease to induce remission,
and in the maintenance of disease to reduce the frequency of flare-ups. Corticosteroids such as prednisone may be used (PO, PR, or IV) to treat patients with moderate to severe disease. Once remission is achieved, the steroids should be tapered

Immune modulators are used for more severe, refractory disease. Such medications
include 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody infliximab. Anti-TNF therapy, such as infliximab, has been an
important treatment of patients with Crohn disease who are refractory to steroids,
and more recently has shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis. Patients receiving the
potent immunomodulator infliximab are at increased risk of infection, including
reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
Surgery is indicated for complications of ulcerative colitis. Total colectomy is performed in patients with carcinoma, toxic megacolon, perforation, and uncontrollable bleeding. Surgery is curative for ulcerative colitis if symptoms persist despite
medical therapy. Two very important and potentially life-threatening complications
of ulcerative colitis are toxic megacolon and colon cancer. Toxic megacolon occurs
when the colon dilates to a diameter more than 6 cm. It usually is accompanied

by fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and evidence of serious toxicity, such as
hypotension or altered mental status. Therapy is designed to reduce the chance
of perforation and includes IV fluids, nasogastric tube placed to suction, and placing the patient NPO (nothing by mouth). Additionally, IV antibiotics are given
in anticipation of possible perforation, and IV steroids are given to reduce inflammation. The most severe consequence of toxic megacolon is colonic perforation
complicated by peritonitis or hemorrhage.
Patients with ulcerative colitis have a marked increase in the incidence of colon
cancer compared to the general population. The risk of cancer increases over time
and is related to disease duration and extent. It is seen both in patients with active
disease and in patients whose disease has been in remission. Annual or biennial
colonoscopy is advised in patients with ulcerative colitis, beginning 8 years after
diagnosis of pancolitis, and random biopsies should be sent for evaluation. If colon
cancer or dysplasia is found, a colectomy should be performed.

16.4 A 35-year-old woman has chronic crampy abdominal pain and intermittent

endoscopy with biopsies are normal, and stool cultures are negative. Which of
the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Infectious colitis
B. Irritable bowel syndrome
C. Crohn disease
D. Ulcerative colitis

ANSWERS
16.1 A. Fistulas are common with Crohn disease because of its transmural nature
but are uncommon in ulcerative colitis. Gallstones are common in patients
with Crohn disease due to ileal bile salt malabsorption and depletion, causing
the formation of more cholesterol-rich lithogenic bile.
16.2 C. The ERCP shows the typical appearance for primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), which is associated with IBD in 75% of cases. Stone-induced strictures
should be extrahepatic and unifocal. Cholangiocarcinoma is less common but
may develop in 10% of patients with PSC.
16.3 C. With toxic megacolon, antibiotics and surgical intervention are often necessary and life saving. Medical therapy is usually ineffective.
16.4 B. Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by intermittent diarrhea and
crampy abdominal pain often relieved with defecation, but no weight loss or
abnormal blood in the stool. It is a diagnosis of exclusion once other conditions,
such as inﬂammatory bowel disease and parasitic infection (eg, giardiasis), have
been excluded.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Ulcerative colitis always involves the rectum and may extend proximally
in a continuous distribution.



Crohn disease most commonly involves the distal ileum, but it may
involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract and has “skip lesions.”



Because of transmural inflammation, Crohn disease often is complicated
by fistula formation.



Toxic megacolon is characterized by dilation of the colon along with systemic toxicity; failure to improve with medical therapy may require surgical intervention.



Ulcerative colitis is associated with increased risk of colon cancer; the risk
increases with duration and extent of disease.

Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease can be associated with extraintestinal manifestations, such as uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma
gangrenosum, arthritis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

A 54-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease is
admitted to the coronary care unit with worsening angina and hypertension. His
pain is controlled with intravenous nitroglycerin, and he is treated with aspirin,
beta-blockers to lower his heart rate, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors to lower his blood pressure. Cardiac enzymes are normal. He undergoes coronary angiography, which reveals no significant stenosis. By the next day,
his urine output has diminished to 200 mL over 24 hours. Examination at that

ANSWERS TO CASE 17:
Acute Kidney Injury
Summary: A 54-year-old diabetic man is receiving medical therapy consisting of
oral aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitor, and intravenous nitroglycerin for treatment of his angina and hypertension. He undergoes coronary angiography, which
reveals no significant stenosis. He is normotensive. His funduscopic examination
shows dot hemorrhages and hard exudates, evidence of diabetic retinopathy. In this
setting, the baseline elevated creatinine level on admission likely represents diabetic
nephropathy as well. His creatinine level has risen to 2.9 mg/dL from 1.6 mg/dL on
admission. By the next day, he has become oliguric.
• New clinical problem: Acute kidney injury (AKI)
• Next step: Urinalysis and urine chemistries to determine whether the process is
prerenal or renal, or less likely postrenal

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the common causes, evaluation, and prevention of AKI in hospitalized patients.
2. Know how to use urinalysis and serum chemistry values in the diagnostic approach
of AKI so as to be able to categorize the etiology as prerenal, renal, or postrenal.
3. Be familiar with the management of hyperkalemia and indications for acute
dialysis.

Considerations
A 54-year-old man with diabetes, retinopathy, and some chronic kidney disease
develops AKI in the hospital, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine level
to 2.9 mg/dL and BUN of 69 mg/dL. He has undergone several medical therapies
and procedures, all of which might be potentially contributory: acute lowering of his
blood pressure, an ACE inhibitor, radiocontrast media, and arterial catheterization
with possible atheroemboli. The mortality rate associated with critically ill patients
who develop AKI is high; thus, identifying and treating the underlying etiology of
this patient’s kidney failure and taking measures to protect the kidneys from further
damage are essential.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO:
Acute Renal Failure
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (AKI): Abrupt decline in kidney function, measured
as glomerular filtration rate (GFR). True GFR is difficult to measure, so we rely on
increases in serum creatinine levels to indicate a fall in GFR. Because creatinine is
both filtered and secreted by the kidneys, changes in serum creatinine concentrations
always lag behind and underestimate the decline in the GFR. In other words, by the
time the serum creatinine level rises, the GFR has already fallen significantly.
ANURIA: Less than 50 mL of urine output in 24 hours. Acute obstruction, cortical
necrosis, and vascular catastrophes such as aortic dissection should be considered in
the differential diagnosis.
OLIGURIA: Less than 400 mL of urine output in 24 hours. Physiologically, it is the
lowest amount of urine a person on a normal diet can make if he or she is severely
dehydrated and does not retain uremic waste products. Oliguria is a poor prognostic
sign in ARF. Patients with oliguric renal failure have higher mortality rates and
less renal recovery than do patients who are nonoliguric.
UREMIA: Nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, weakness, nausea and early morning
vomiting, itchiness, confusion, pericarditis, and coma attributed to the retention of
waste products in renal failure but do not always correlate with the BUN level. A
highly malnourished patient with renal failure may have a modestly elevated BUN
and be uremic. Another patient may have a highly elevated BUN and be asymptomatic. Elevated BUN without symptoms is called azotemia.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The differential diagnosis of AKI proceeds from consideration of three basic pathophysiologic mechanisms: prerenal failure, postrenal failure, and intrinsic renal
failure. Individuals with prerenal failure experience diminished GFR as a result of
a marked decreased renal blood perfusion so that less glomerular filtrate is formed.
Sometimes, the clinical presentation is straightforward, such as volume depletion
from gastrointestinal fluid loss or hemorrhage; at other times, the presentation of
patients with prerenal failure can be more confusing. For example, a patient with
severe nephrotic syndrome may appear to be volume overloaded because of the massive peripheral edema present, while the effective arterial blood volume may be very
low as a consequence of the severe hypoalbuminemia. Yet the mechanism of this
individual’s AKI is prerenal. Similarly, a patient with severe congestive heart failure
may have prerenal failure because of a low cardiac ejection fraction, yet be fluid
overloaded with peripheral and pulmonary edema. The key is to assess “what the
kidneys see” versus the remainder of the body. Typically, the BUN:Cr ratio is more
than 20 in prerenal failure. Medications such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and ACE inhibitors can alter intrarenal blood flow and
result in prerenal failure. Table 17–1 provides an abbreviated listing of the etiologies
of prerenal failure.

Postrenal failure, also referred to as obstructive nephropathy, implies blockage
of urinary flow. The site of obstruction can be anywhere along the urinary system, including the intratubular region (crystals), ureters (stones, extrinsic compression by tumor), bladder, or urethra. By far, the most common causes of obstructive
nephropathy are ureteral obstruction due to malignancy, or prostatic obstruction due
to benign or malignant hypertrophy. The patient’s symptoms depend on whether or
not both kidneys are involved, the degree of obstruction, and the time course of the
blockage. This is usually diagnosed by seeing hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.
Intrinsic renal failure is caused by disorders that injure the renal glomeruli or
tubules directly. These include glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and
acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from either ischemia or nephrotoxic drugs. Table 17–2
lists major causes of intrinsic AKI.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

163

Evaluation of a patient with AKI starts with a detailed history and physical
examination. Does the patient have signs or symptoms of a systemic disease, such
as heart failure or cirrhosis, that could cause prerenal failure? Does the patient have
symptoms of a disease, such as lupus, that could cause a glomerulonephritis? Did the
patient receive something in the hospital that could cause ATN, such as intravenous contrast or an aminoglycoside? While in the operating room did the patient
become hypotensive from sepsis or from hemorrhage that caused ischemic ATN?
Is the patient receiving an antibiotic and now has allergic interstitial nephritis? In
addition to the history and physical examination, urinalysis and measurement of
urinary electrolytes are helpful in making the diagnosis.

Urinalysis
The urine findings based on testing with reagent paper and microscopic examination help with the diagnosis of ARF (Table 17–3). In prerenal failure, urinalysis
usually reveals a high specific gravity and normal microscopic findings. Individuals
with postrenal failure typically are unable to concentrate the urine, so the urine
osmolality is equal to the serum osmolality (isosthenuria) and the specific gravity
is 1.010. The microscopic findings vary depending on the cause of the obstruction: hematuria (crystals or stones), leukocytes (prostatic hypertrophy), or normal
(extrinsic ureteral compression from a tumor). Urinalysis of various intrinsic renal
disorders may be helpful. Ischemic and nephrotoxic ATN usually is associated with
urine that is isosthenuric, often with proteinuria, and containing “muddy brown”
granular casts on microscopy. In glomerulonephritis, the urine generally reveals
moderate to severe proteinuria, sometimes in the nephrotic range, and microscopic
hematuria and red blood cell (RBC) casts. Tubulointerstitial nephritis classically produces urine that is isosthenuric (the tubules are unable to concentrate the
urine), with mild proteinuria, and on microscopy, reveals leukocytes, white cell
casts, and urinary eosinophils.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Urinary Electrolytes
Measurement of urinary electrolytes and calculation of the fractional excretion of
sodium (FENa) were devised to differentiate oliguric prerenal failure from oliguric
ATN; they are of little use in other circumstances. FENa represents the amount of
sodium filtered by the kidneys that is not reabsorbed. The kidneys of a healthy
person on a normal diet usually reabsorb more than 99% of the sodium that is
filtered, with a corresponding FENa less than 1%. Normally, the excreted sodium
represents the dietary intake of sodium, maintaining sodium homeostasis. In prerenal failure, decreased renal perfusion leads to a diminished GFR; if the renal tubular
function is intact, FENa remains less than 1%. Furthermore, because the patient has
either true volume depletion or “effective” volume depletion, serum aldosterone
will stimulate the kidneys to retain sodium, and the urinary sodium will be low
(<20 mEq/L). On the other hand, in oliguric ATN, the renal failure is caused by
tubular injury. Hence, there is tubular dysfunction with an associated inability to
reabsorb sodium, leading to an FENa more than 2% and a urinary sodium exceeding 20 mEq/L.
Measurements of FENa and urinary sodium are less helpful in other circumstances.
For example, in nonoliguric ATN, the injury usually is less severe, so the kidneys
still may maintain sodium reabsorption and be able to produce an FENa less than 1%.
Diuretic medications, which interfere with sodium reabsorption, are often used in
congestive heart failure or nephrotic syndrome. Although these patients may have
prerenal failure, the use of diuretics will increase the urinary sodium and FENa. In
acute glomerulonephritis, the kidneys often avidly resorb sodium, leading to very
low urinary sodium levels and FENa. Early in the course of postobstructive renal
failure caused by ureteral obstruction, the afferent arteriole typically undergoes
intense vasoconstriction, with consequent, low urinary sodium levels (Table 17–3).
The indications for dialysis in AKI include fluid overload, such as pulmonary
edema, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, uremic pericarditis, severe hyperphosphatemia, and uremic symptoms. Because of the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias,
severe hyperkalemia is considered an emergency, best treated acutely medically
and not with dialysis. An urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed on
any patient with suspected hyperkalemia; if the classic peaked or “tented” T waves
are present, intravenous calcium should be administered immediately. Although it
will not lower the serum potassium level, the calcium will oppose the membrane
effects of the high potassium concentration on the heart, allowing time for other
methods to lower the potassium level. One of the most effective methods for treating hyperkalemia is administration of intravenous insulin (usually 10 units), along
with 50 to 100 mL of 50% glucose solution to prevent hypoglycemia. Insulin drives
potassium into cells, lowering levels within 30 minutes. Potassium also can be driven
intracellularly with a beta-agonist, such as albuterol, by nebulizer. In the presence
of a severe metabolic acidosis, administration of intravenous sodium bicarbonate
also promotes intracellular diffusion of potassium, albeit less effectively. All three
therapies have only a transient effect on serum potassium levels, because the total
body potassium balance is unchanged, and the potassium eventually leaks back out
of the cells. Definitive treatment of hyperkalemia, removal of potassium from the
body, is accomplished by one of three methods: (1) administration of a loop diuretic

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

165

such as furosemide to increase urinary flow and excretion of potassium, or, if the
patient does not make sufficient urine, (2) administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), a cationic exchange resin that lowers potassium by exchanging
sodium for potassium in the colon, or, finally, (3) emergency dialysis.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
17.1 A 63-year-old woman with a history of cervical cancer treated with hysterectomy and pelvic irradiation now presents with acute oliguric renal failure. On
physical examination, she has normal jugular venous pressure, is normotensive
without orthostasis, and has a benign abdominal examination. Her urinalysis
shows a speciﬁc gravity of 1.010, with no cells or casts on microscopy. Urinary
FENa is 2%, and the Na level is 35 mEq/L. Which of the following is the best
next step?
A. Bolus of intravenous fluids
B. Renal ultrasound
C. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen with intravenous
contrast
D. Administration of furosemide to increase her urine output
17.2 A 49-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic renal failure as
a consequence of diabetic nephropathy is brought to the emergency room
for nausea, lethargy, and confusion. His physical examination is signiﬁcant
for an elevated jugular venous pressure, clear lung ﬁelds, and harsh systolic
and diastolic sounds heard over the precordium. Serum chemistries reveal
K 5.1 mEq/L, CO2 17 mEq/L, BUN 145 mg/dL, and creatinine 9.8 mg/dL.
Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy?
A. Administer IV insulin and glucose.
B. Administer IV sodium bicarbonate.
C. Administer IV furosemide.
D. Urgent hemodialysis.
17.3 A 62-year-old diabetic man underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
2 days ago. He is being treated with gentamicin for a urinary tract infection.
His urine output has fallen to 300 mL over 24 hours, and his serum creatinine
has risen from 1.1 mg/dL on admission to 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following
laboratory values would be most consistent with a prerenal etiology of his renal
insufﬁciency?
A. FENa of 3%
B. Urinary sodium level of 10 mEq/L
C. Central venous pressure reading of 10 mm Hg
D. Gentamicin trough level of 4 μg/mL

166

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
17.1 B. Renal ultrasound is the next appropriate step to assess for hydronephrosis
and to evaluate for bilateral ureteral obstructions, which are common sites
of metastases of cervical cancer. Her physical examination and urine studies (showing an FE > 1%) are inconsistent with hypovolemia, so intravenous
infusion is unlikely to improve her renal function. Use of loop diuretics may
increase her urine output somewhat but does not help to diagnose the cause of
her renal failure or to improve her outcome. Further imaging may be necessary
after the ultrasound, but use of intravenous contrast at this point may actually
worsen her renal failure.
17.2 D. The patient has uremia, hyperkalemia, and (likely) uremic pericarditis,
which may progress to life-threatening cardiac tamponade unless the underlying renal failure is treated with dialysis. As for the other treatments, insulin plus glucose would treat hyperkalemia, and bicarbonate would help with
both metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia, but in this patient, his potassium
and bicarbonate levels are only mildly abnormal and are not immediately life
threatening. Furosemide will not help because he does not have pulmonary
edema and has renal insufﬁciency.
17.3 B. Prerenal insufﬁciency connotes insufﬁcient blood volume, typically with
FENa less than 1% and urinary sodium less than 20 mEq/L. Supporting information would be a low central venous pressure reading (normal central venous
pressure is 4-8 mm Hg). The gentamicin level of 4 μg/mL is elevated (normal
<2 μg/mL) and may predispose to kidney damage.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The two main causes of AKI in hospitalized patients are prerenal azotemia
and acute tubular necrosis.



In the anuric patient, one must quickly determine if the kidneys are
obstructed or if the vascular supply is interrupted.



Treatment of prerenal renal failure is volume replacement; treatment of
postrenal failure is relief of the obstruction.



The main causes of postrenal failure are obstruction caused by prostatic
hypertrophy in men and bilateral ureteral obstruction caused by abdominal
or pelvic malignancy in either gender.



Uremic pericarditis is an indication for urgent hemodialysis. Other indications include hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, severe hyperphosphatemia,
and volume overload when refractory to medical management.



Treatment of hyperkalemia: C BIG K (calcium, bicarbonate/beta-agonist,
insulin, glucose, Kayexalate).



Hyperkalemia is treated initially with calcium to stabilize cardiac membranes; insulin and beta-agonists to redistribute potassium intracellularly
(sodium bicarbonate if there is a severe metabolic acidosis); and then
loop diuretics, a potassium exchange resin, or hemodialysis to remove
excess potassium from the body.



Indications for dialysis: AEIOU (acidosis, electrolyte disturbances, ingestions, overload, uremia).

CASE 18
A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency room complaining of retrosternal
chest pain for the past 2 days. The pain is constant, not associated with exertion,
worsens when she takes a deep breath, and is relieved by sitting up and leaning
forward. She denies any shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis.
On examination, her temperature is 99.4°F, heart rate 104 bpm, and blood
pressure 118/72 mm Hg. She is sitting forward on the stretcher, with shallow
respirations. Her conjunctivae are clear and her oral mucosa is pink, with two aphthous ulcers. Her neck veins are not distended; her chest is clear to auscultation
and is mildly tender to palpation. Her heart rhythm is regular, with a harsh leathery
sound over the apex heard during systole and diastole. Her abdominal examination is benign, and her extremities show warmth and swelling of the proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints of both hands.
Laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2100/mm3,
hemoglobin concentration 10.4 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 94 fL,
and platelet count 78,000/mm3. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine
levels are normal. Urinalysis shows 10 to 20 WBCs and 5 to 10 red blood cells
(RBCs) per high-powered field (hpf). A urine drug screen is negative.
Chest x-ray is read as normal, with a normal cardiac silhouette and no pulmonary
infiltrates or effusions. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in Figure 18–1.

ANSWER TO CASE 18:
Acute Pericarditis Caused by Systemic
Lupus Erythematosus
Summary: A 27-year-old woman presents with nonexertional pleuritic chest pain
that is relieved with sitting forward. In addition, she has a pericardial friction rub
and ECG changes consistent with acute pericarditis. She has no radiographic evidence of a large pericardial effusion and no clinical signs of cardiac tamponade.
Regarding the etiology of her pericarditis, she has pancytopenia and an active urinary sediment, which could be caused by infection but may also represent a connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute pericarditis as a consequence of SLE

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical and ECG features of pericarditis and be able to recognize a
pericardial friction rub.
2. Know the causes of pericarditis and its treatment.
3. Know the diagnostic criteria for SLE.
4. Know the major complications of SLE and its treatment.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

171

Considerations
In patients with chest pain, one of the primary diagnostic considerations is always
myocardial ischemia or infarction. This is particularly true when the ECG is abnormal with changes that may represent myocardial injury, such as ST-segment elevation. However, other conditions may produce ST-segment elevation, such as acute
pericarditis. ECG findings can help distinguish between these two diagnoses.

APPROACH TO:
Acute Pericarditis
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE PERICARDITIS: An inflammation of the pericardial sac surrounding
the heart.
PERICARDIAL FRICTION RUB: Harsh, high-pitched, scratchy sound, with
variable intensity, usually best heard at the left sternal border by auscultation, due
to pericarditis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Acute pericarditis can result from a multitude of disease processes, but the most
common causes are listed in Table 18–1.
There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, from subclinical or inapparent inflammation, to the classic presentation of acute pericarditis with chest pain,
to subacute or chronic inflammation, persisting for weeks to months. Most patients
with acute pericarditis seek medical attention because of chest pain. The classic
description is a sudden onset of substernal chest pain, which worsens on inspiration
and with recumbency, that often radiates to the trapezius ridge, and is improved by
sitting and leaning forward. Other clinical features vary according to the cause of
the pericarditis, but most patients are thought to have viral infection and often present with low-grade fever, malaise, or upper respiratory illness symptoms.

Table 18–1 • COMMON CAUSES OF ACUTE PERICARDITIS
Idiopathic pericarditis: specific diagnosis unidentified, presumably either viral or autoimmune and
requires no specific management
Infectious: viral, bacterial, tuberculous, parasitic
Vasculitis: autoimmune diseases, postradiation therapy
Hypersensitivity/immunologic reactions, eg, Dressler syndrome
Diseases of contiguous structures, eg, during transmural myocardial infarction
Metabolic disease, eg, uremia, Gaucher disease
Trauma: penetrating or nonpenetrating chest injury
Neoplasms: usually thoracic malignancies such as breast, lung, or lymphoma
(Data from Spodick DH. Acute pericarditis: current concepts and practice. JAMA. 2003;289:1150-1153.)

172

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

A pericardial friction rub is pathognomonic and virtually 100% specific for acute
pericarditis. The sensitivity of this sign varies, though, because friction rubs tend to
come and go over hours. Classically, a rub is a harsh, high-pitched, scratchy sound,
with variable intensity, usually best heard at the left sternal border. It can have one,
two, or three components: presystolic (correlating with atrial systole), systolic, and
diastolic. The large majority of rubs are triphasic (all three components) or biphasic,
having a systolic and either an early or late diastolic component. In these cases, it
usually is easy to diagnose the pericardial friction rub and acute pericarditis. When
the rub is monophasic (just a systolic component), it often is difficult to distinguish
a pericardial friction rub from a harsh murmur, making bedside diagnosis difficult
and uncertain. In these cases, one should look for ECG evidence of pericarditis
(Table 18–2) and perform serial examinations because the rub may vary with time.
The classic ECG findings in acute pericarditis as seen in this patient include diffuse ST-segment elevation in association with PR-segment depression. The opposite findings (PR-segment elevation and ST-segment depression) are often seen in
leads aVR and V1. Because of the presentation with chest pain and ST-segment
elevation on ECG, acute pericarditis may be confused with acute myocardial infarction (MI). This is potentially a serious problem because if the patient is treated with
thrombolytics for infarction, the patient may develop pericardial hemorrhage and
cardiac tamponade. Several clinical features can help to differentiate the two conditions: acute ischemia is more likely to have a gradual onset of pain with crescendo
pattern; it usually is described as a heavy pressure or squeezing sensation rather than
the sharp pain of pericarditis; it typically does not vary with respiration; and it is
relieved with nitrates, whereas the pain of pericarditis is not. In addition, several
ECG features can help to make the distinction (Table 18–2). Also, if the ECG
reveals arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities, the condition is much more likely
to represent ischemia rather than pericarditis.
Most patients with acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis have excellent
prognoses. Treatment is mainly symptomatic, with aspirin or another nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as indomethacin, for relief of chest pain.
Colchicine or corticosteroids may be used for refractory symptoms. In most patients,
symptoms typically resolve within days to 2 to 3 weeks. Any form of pericarditis
can cause pericardial effusion and bleeding; however, the most serious consequence

Table 18–3 • DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR SLE
Malar rash: fixed erythema, flat or raised over the malar area, that tends to spare nasolabial folds
Discoid rash: erythematous raised patches with adherent keratotic scaling and follicular plugging
Photosensitivity: skin rash as a result of exposure to sunlight
Oral or vaginal ulcers: usually painless
Arthritis: nonerosive, involving two or more peripheral joints with tenderness, swelling, and
effusion
Serositis: usually pleuritis or pericarditis
Renal involvement: persistent proteinuria or cellular casts
Neurologic disorder: seizure or psychosis
Hematologic disorder: hemolytic anemia or leukopenia (<4000/mm3) on two or more occasions,
or lymphopenia (<1500/mm3) on two or more occasions, or thrombocytopenia (<100 000/mm3)
Immunologic disorder: positive anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Smith Ab, antiphospholipid Ab
Antinuclear antibody (ANA): positive ANA in absence of drugs known to induce ANA

would be cardiac tamponade. It is a common misconception that a pericardial friction rub cannot coexist with an effusion (both are very common in uremic pericarditis). Therefore, it is important to monitor these patients for signs of developing
hemodynamic compromises, such as cardiac tamponade.
Our patient is very young and has no significant previous medical history. The
presence of symmetric arthritis as well as laboratory findings suggests a systemic
disease, such as SLE, as the cause of her pericarditis. SLE is a systemic inflammatory
disease that mainly affects women. It is characterized by autoimmune multiorgan
involvement, such as pericarditis, nephritis, pleuritis, arthritis, and skin disorders.
To diagnose SLE, the patient must meet 4 of the 11 criteria listed in Table 18–3
(96% sensitive and 96% specific).
Our patient has serositis (pericarditis), oral ulcers, hematologic disorders
(leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia), arthritis, and renal involvement
(hematuria)—she clearly meets the criteria for SLE. Although the patient in the
scenario, like most lupus patients, sought medical attention because of the pain of
arthritis or serositis, both these problems are generally manageable or self-limited.
The arthritis is generally nonerosive and nondeforming, and the serositis usually
resolves spontaneously without sequelae. The major complication of SLE usually is
related to renal involvement, which can cause hypertension, chronic renal failure,
nephrotic syndrome, or end-stage renal disease. In the past, renal disease was the
most common cause of death of SLE patients, but now it can be treated with powerful
immunosuppressants, such as high-dose corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide. Other
serious complications of lupus include central nervous system (CNS) disorders,
which are highly variable and unpredictable and can include seizures, psychosis,
stroke syndromes, and cranial neuropathies. In addition to renal failure and CNS
involvement, the most common causes of death in SLE patients are infection (often
related to the immunosuppression used to treat the disease) and vascular disease, for
example, myocardial infarction.

C.
D.

NSAIDs
Dialysis
Steroids

18.2 The patient described in Question 18.1 is hospitalized, but there is a delay
in initiating treatment. You are called to the bedside because he has become
hypotensive with systolic blood pressure of 85/68 mm Hg, a heart rate of
122 bpm, and you note pulsus paradoxus. A repeat ECG is unchanged
from admission. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate
intervention?
A. Draw blood cultures and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected
sepsis.
B. Intravenous furosemide for fluid overload.
C. Echocardiographic-guided pericardiocentesis.
D. Percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction.
18.3 A 25-year-old woman complains of pain in her PIP and metacarpophalangeal
(MCP) joints and reports a recent positive ANA laboratory test. Which of the
following clinical features would not be consistent with a diagnosis of SLE?
A. Pleural effusion
B. Malar rash
C. Sclerodactyly
D. Urinary sediment with RBC casts

ANSWERS
18.1 B. Uremic pericarditis is considered a medical emergency and an indication
for urgent dialysis.
18.2 C. The clinical picture suggests the patient has developed pericardial tamponade, which may be life threatening and often requires urgent pericardiocentesis.
18.3 C. Sclerodactyly, which is thickened and tight skin of the ﬁngers and toes, is
a classic feature of patients with scleroderma (who may also have a positive
ANA test), but is not seen in SLE. The other ﬁndings (malar rash, serositis,
glomerulonephritis) are typical of SLE, but not seen in scleroderma.

Treatment of pericarditis is directed at the underlying cause; for example,
for uremic pericarditis, urgent dialysis is necessary. For viral or inflammatory causes, treatment is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids for refractory cases.

Systemic lupus erythematosus can be diagnosed if a patient has four of
the following features: malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral
ulcers, arthritis, serositis, renal disease, neurologic manifestations,
hematologic cytopenias, immunologic abnormalities (eg, false-positive
Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] test), and positive antinuclear antibody.

The major morbidity and mortality of systemic lupus erythematosus are
consequences of renal disease, central nervous system involvement, or
infection.

CASE 19
A 27-year-old man presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of 2 days of facial
and hand swelling. He first noticed swelling around his eyes 2 days ago, along
with difficulty putting on his wedding ring because of swollen fingers. Additionally,
he noticed that his urine appears reddish-brown and that he has had less urine
output over the last several days. He has no significant medical history. His only
medication is ibuprofen that he took 2 weeks ago for fever and a sore throat, which
have since resolved. On examination, he is afebrile, with heart rate 85 bpm and
blood pressure 164/98 mm Hg. He has periorbital edema; his funduscopic examination is normal without arteriovenous nicking or papilledema. His chest is clear
to auscultation, his heart rhythm is regular with a nondisplaced point of maximal
impulse (PMI), and he has no abdominal masses or bruits. He does have edema
of his feet, hands, and face. A dipstick urinalysis in the clinic shows specific gravity
of 1.025 with 3+ blood and 2+ protein, but it is otherwise negative.

ANSWERS TO CASE 19:
Acute Glomerulonephritis, Poststreptococcal Infection
Summary: A 27-year-old man complains of several days of facial and hand swelling,
decreased urine output, and reddish-brown urine. He took ibuprofen for fever and a
sore throat 2 weeks ago. He is afebrile, hypertensive, and has periorbital edema but
a normal funduscopic examination. His cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal examinations are normal, but he does have edema of his feet, hands, and face. A dipstick
urinalysis in the clinic shows hematuria and proteinuria.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute glomerulonephritis (GN).
• Next diagnostic step: Examine a fresh spun urine specimen to look for red
blood cell (RBC) casts or dysmorphic red blood cells.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to differentiate glomerular from nonglomerular bleeding.
2. Understand the clinical features of GN.
3. Know how to evaluate and treat a patient with GN.
4. Be familiar with the evaluation of a patient with nonglomerular hematuria.

Considerations
A young man without a significant medical history now presents with new onset of
hypertension, edema, and hematuria following an upper respiratory tract infection.
He has no history of renal disease, does not have manifestations of chronic hypertension, and has not received any nephrotoxins. He does not have other symptoms of
inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The presentation of acute
renal failure, hypertension, edema, and hematuria in a young man with no significant
medical history is highly suggestive of glomerular injury (GN). He likely has acute
GN, either postinfectious (streptococcal) or immunoglobulin (Ig)A nephropathy.
The reddish-brown appearance of the urine could represent hematuria, which was
later suggested by dipstick urinalysis (3+ blood); hence, microscopic examination of
the urine for RBCs is very important. Together, the history and the examination suggest that the patient likely has acute GN, either primary GN of unknown etiology
(no concomitant systemic disease is mentioned) or secondary GN as a result of recent
upper respiratory infection (postinfectious GN). The next logical step in diagnosing
GN should be to examine the precipitate of a freshly spun urine sample for active
sediment (cellular components, red cell casts, dysmorphic red cells). If present, these
are signs of inflammation and establish the diagnosis of acute GN. Although likely
to be present, these markers do not distinguish among the distinct immune-mediated
causes of GN; they merely allow us to make the diagnosis of acute GN (primary or
secondary). Further evaluation with serologic markers, such as complement levels and
antistreptolysin-O (ASO) titers (Table 19–1), may help to further classify the GN.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Glomerulonephritis
DEFINITIONS
HEMATURIA: Presence of blood in the urine.
GROSS HEMATURIA: Blood in the urine visible to the eye.
MICROSCOPIC HEMATURIA: Red blood cells in the urine that require microscopy for diagnosis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The term hematuria describes the presence of blood in the urine. Although direct
visualization of a urine sample (gross hematuria) or dipstick examination (positive
blood) can be helpful, the diagnosis of hematuria is made by microscopic confirmation of the presence of red blood cells (microscopic hematuria). The first step in
evaluating a patient who complains of red-dark urine is to differentiate between true
hematuria (presence of RBCs in urine) and pigmented urine (red-dark urine). The
breakdown products of muscle cells and red blood cells (myoglobin and hemoglobin,
respectively) are heme-containing compounds capable of turning the color of urine
dark red or brown in the absence of true hematuria (red blood cells). A dipstick
urinalysis positive for blood without the presence of RBCs (negative microscopic
cellular sediment) is suggestive of hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria.
After confirmation, the etiology of the hematuria should be determined.
Hematuria can be classified into two broad categories: intrarenal and extrarenal
(Table 19–2). The history and physical examination are very helpful in the evaluation (age, fever, pain, family history). Laboratory analysis and imaging studies often
are necessary, and considering the potential clinical implications, the etiology of
hematuria should be pursued in all cases of hematuria. First, examination of the
cellular urine sediment can help to differentiate glomerular from nonglomerular hematuria. The presence of dysmorphic/fragmented RBCs or red cell casts is
indicative of glomerular origin (GN). Second, the urine Gram stain and culture
can aid in the diagnosis of infectious hematuria. Third, the urine sample should be
sent for cytologic evaluation when the diagnosis of malignancy is suspected. Finally,

Intrarenal hematuria
• Kidney trauma
• Renal stones and crystals
• Glomerulonephritis
• Infection (pyelonephritis)
• Neoplasia (renal cell carcinoma)
• Vascular injury (vasculitis, renal thrombosis)
Extrarenal hematuria
• Trauma (eg, Foley placement)
• Infections (urethritis, prostatitis, cystitis)
• Nephrolithiasis (ureteral stones)
• Neoplasia (prostate, bladder)

renal imaging via ultrasound or CT scan can help in the visualization of the renal
parenchyma and vascular structures. Cystoscopy can be used to assess the bladder.

Glomerular Disease
Glomerular disease is encountered mainly in the form of two distinct syndromes:
nephritic or nephrotic (or sometimes an overlap of the two syndromes). Nephritis
(nephritic syndrome) is defined as an inflammatory renal syndrome that presents
as hematuria, edema, hypertension, and a low degree of proteinuria (<1-2 g/d).
Nephrosis (or the nephrotic syndrome) is a noninflammatory (no active sediment
in the urine) glomerulopathy that causes heavy proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome is
distinguished by four features: (1) edema, (2) hypoalbuminemia, (3) hyperlipidemia,
and (4) proteinuria (>3 g/d). Glomerular injury may result from a variety of insults
and presents either as the sole clinical finding in a patient (primary renal disease) or
as part of a complex syndrome of a systemic disorder (secondary glomerular disease).
For the purpose of this discussion, glomerulonephritis (GN) includes only the inflammatory glomerulopathies.

Nephritic Syndrome
The presentation of acute renal failure with associated hypertension, hematuria, and
edema is consistent with acute GN. Acute kidney injury, as manifested by a decrease
in urine output and azotemia, results from impaired urine production and ineffective
filtration of nitrogenous waste by the glomerulus. Common signs suggesting an inflammatory glomerular cause of renal failure (ie, acute GN) include hematuria (caused by
ruptured capillaries in the glomerulus), proteinuria (caused by altered permeability
of the capillary walls), edema (caused by salt and water retention), and hypertension
(caused by fluid retention and disturbed renal homeostasis of blood pressure). The
presence of this constellation of signs in a patient makes the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis very likely. However, it is important to note that often patients present
with an overlap syndrome, sharing signs of both nephritis and nephrosis. Moreover,
the presence of hematuria in itself is not pathognomonic for GN because there are
multiple causes of hematuria of nonglomerular origin. Therefore, confirmation of the
presumptive diagnosis of acute glomerulonephritis requires microscopic examination

of a urine sample from the suspected patient. The presence of red cell casts (inflammatory cast) or dysmorphic RBCs (caused by filtration through damaged glomeruli)
in a sample of spun urine establishes the diagnosis of GN.
Once the diagnosis of acute GN is made, it can be broadly classified as either
primary (present clinically as a renal disorder) or secondary (renal injury caused by a
systemic disease). The specific diagnosis can usually be established by clinical history and serologic evaluation, and often requires a kidney biopsy (Table 19–3).

Diagnostic Approach to Glomerulonephritis
The approach to the patient with glomerular disease should be systematic and undertaken in a stepwise fashion. The history should be approached meticulously, looking
for evidence of preexisting renal disease, exposure to nephrotoxins, and especially
any underlying systemic illness. Serologic markers of systemic diseases should be
obtained, if indicated (Figure 19–1) in order to further classify the GN. Once the
appropriate serologic tests have been reviewed, a kidney biopsy may be required. A
biopsy sample can be examined under the light microscope in order to determine
the primary histopathologic injury to the nephron (MPGN, crescentic GN, etc).
Further examination of an immunofluorescent stained sample for immune recognition (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, or pauci-immune staining) of the affected glomerular
membrane (capillary, epithelial, etc) and under electron microscopy for characteristic patterns of immune deposition (granular, linear GN) may provide a definitive
diagnosis of the immune-mediated injury to the glomeruli. Figure 19–1 shows an
algorithmic approach to the patient with acute GN.
A common clinical scenario is to distinguish between postinfectious (usually
streptococcal) GN versus IgA nephropathy. Both illnesses can present with GN
occurring after an upper respiratory illness. The history can sometimes provide a
clue. In poststreptococcal GN (PSGN), the glomerulonephritis typically does not
set in until several weeks after the initial infection. In contrast, IgA nephropathy
may present with pharyngitis and glomerulonephritis at the same time. In addition,
PSGN classically presents with hypocomplementemia, and if the patient undergoes

a renal biopsy there is evidence of an immune complex-mediated process. In contrast, IgA nephropathy has normal complement levels and negative ASO titer (IgA
levels may be elevated in about a third of patients, but this is nonspecific) and the
renal biopsy will show mesangial IgA.

Treatment of Glomerulonephritis
Treatment depends on the diagnosis of the glomerulonephritis, whether it is a primary renal disease or secondary to a systemic illness. When appropriate, the underlying disease should be treated (infective endocarditis, hepatitis, SLE, or vasculitis).
The use of steroids and cyclophosphamide has been advocated in the treatment of
ANCA-induced GN, while other antibody-mediated GNs might require plasmapheresis in order to eliminate the inciting antibody–immune complex. Treatment
for poststreptococcal GN is usually supportive, with control of hypertension and
edema, with a very good prognosis. There is no clearly defined treatment for IgA
nephropathy, although ACE inhibitors, fish oils, and steroids have all been used.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
19.1 An 18-year-old marathon runner has been training during the summer. He is
brought to the emergency room disoriented after collapsing on the track. His
temperature is 102°F. A Foley catheter is placed and reveals reddish urine with
3+ blood on dipstick and no cells seen microscopically. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his urine?
A. Underlying renal disease
B. Prerenal azotemia
C. Myoglobinuria
D. Glomerulonephritis

19.3 A 22-year-old man complains of acute hemoptysis over the past week. He denies
smoking or pulmonary disease. His blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg, and his
physical examination is normal. His urinalysis also shows microscopic hematuria
and red blood cell casts. Which of the following is the most likely etiology?
A. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the lungs
B. Acute tuberculosis of the kidneys and lungs
C. Systemic lupus erythematosus
D. Goodpasture disease (antiglomerular basement membrane)

184

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
19.1 C. This individual is suffering from heat exhaustion, which can lead to rhabdomyolysis and release of myoglobin. Myoglobinuria leads to a reddish appearance and positive urine dipstick reaction for blood, but microscopic analysis of
the urine likely will demonstrate no red cells.
19.2 C. The antistreptolysin-O titers typically are elevated and serum complement
levels are decreased in poststreptococcal GN.
19.3 D. Goodpasture (antiglomerular basement membrane) disease typically affects
young males, who present with hemoptysis and hematuria. Antibody against
type IV collagen, expressed in the pulmonary alveolar and glomerular basement membrane, leads to the pulmonary and renal manifestations. Wegener
granulomatosis typically affects older adults, and includes more systemic symptoms such as arthralgias, myalgias, and sinonasal symptoms, and these patients
are positive for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).

CLINICAL PEARLS


Finding red blood cell casts or dysmorphic red blood cells on urinalysis
differentiates glomerular bleeding (eg, glomerulonephritis) from nonglomerular bleeding (eg, kidney stones).



Glomerulonephritis is characterized by hematuria, edema, and hypertension caused by volume retention.



Gross hematuria following an upper respiratory illness suggests either
immunoglobulin A nephropathy or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.



Patients with nonglomerular hematuria and no evidence of infection
should undergo investigation with imaging (ultrasound or intravenous
pyelogram) or cystoscopy to evaluate for stones or malignancy.

CASE 20
A 58-year-old Hispanic woman presents to your office complaining of persistent
swelling of her feet and ankles, so much so that she cannot put on her shoes. She
first noted mild ankle swelling approximately 2 to 3 months ago. She borrowed
a few diuretic pills from a friend; the pills seemed to help, but now she has run
out. She also reports that she has gained 20 to 25 lb over the last few months,
despite regular exercise and trying to adhere to a healthy diet. Her medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes, for which she takes a sulfonylurea agent.
She neither sees a doctor regularly nor monitors her blood glucose at home. She
denies dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency, but she does report that her urine
has appeared foamy. She had no fevers, joint pain, skin rashes, or gastrointestinal
(GI) symptoms.
Her physical examination is significant for mild periorbital edema, multiple hard
exudates, and dot hemorrhages on funduscopic examination, and pitting edema
of her hands, feet, and legs. Her chest is clear, her heart rhythm is regular without
murmurs, and her abdominal examination is benign. She has diminished sensation
to light touch in her feet and legs to mid-calf. A urine dipstick performed in the
office shows 2+ glucose, 3+ protein, and negative leukocyte esterase, nitrates, and
blood.

ANSWERS TO CASE 20:
Nephrotic Syndrome, Diabetic Nephropathy
Summary: A 58-year-old woman with long-standing diabetes now presents with
edema and significant proteinuria on a urine dipstick. She has diabetic retinopathy,
some peripheral neuropathy, and no other findings suggestive of any other systemic
disease.
• Most likely diagnosis: Nephrotic syndrome as a consequence of diabetic
nephropathy
• Best intervention: Angiotensin inhibition with either an ACE inhibitor or
angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB)

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the clinical features and complications of nephrotic syndrome.
2. Know the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome.
3. Understand the natural history of diabetic renal disease and how to diagnose and
manage it.
4. Learn the principles of treatment of nephrotic syndrome.

Considerations
Patients develop significant proteinuria as a result of glomerular damage, which can
result from many systemic diseases. It is important to screen for diseases such as
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), autoimmune diseases, and malignancy by
history, physical examination, and sometimes laboratory investigation to determine
the underlying cause and appropriate treatment of the renal manifestations.

APPROACH TO:
Nephrotic Syndrome
DEFINITION
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME: Urine protein excretion more than 3.5 g over
24 hours, serum hypoalbuminemia (<3 g/dL), hyperlipidemia, and edema.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Normally, the kidneys do not excrete appreciable amounts of protein (<150 mg/d)
because serum proteins are excluded from the urine by the glomerular filter both by
their large size and their net negative charge. Thus, the appearance of significant

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

187

proteinuria heralds glomerular disease, with disruption of its normal barrier function. Proteinuria in excess of 3 to 3.5 g of protein per day is considered to be in the
nephrotic range. The key feature of nephrotic syndrome is the heavy proteinuria,
which leads to loss of albumin and other serum proteins. The hypoalbuminemia and
hypoproteinemia result in decreased intravascular oncotic pressure, leading to tissue
edema that usually starts in dependent areas such as the feet but may progress to
involve the face, hands, and ultimately the whole body (anasarca). Both increased
synthesis and decreased clearance of lipoproteins may lead to hyperlipidemia.
Patients typically present to the doctor complaining of the edema and have the
laboratory features described earlier. Urinalysis usually shows few or no cellular elements and may show waxy casts and oval fat bodies (which look similar to Maltese
crosses under polarized light) if hyperlipidemia is present.
In adults, one-third of patients with nephrotic syndrome have a systemic disease that involves the kidneys, such as diabetes or lupus; the rest have a primary
renal disease, with one of four pathologic lesions: minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Thus, a new diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome
warrants further investigation into an underlying systemic disease. Common tests
include serum glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to evaluate for diabetes,
antinuclear antibody (ANA) to screen for systemic lupus erythematosus, serum and
urine protein electrophoresis to look for multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, and viral
serologies, because HIV and viral hepatitis can cause nephrosis. Less common causes
include various cancers, medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), heavy metals such as mercury, and hereditary renal conditions. Of these
causes, diabetes mellitus is by far the most common, as in the patient presented in
this scenario.
Adults with nephrotic syndrome usually undergo renal biopsy, especially if the
underlying diagnosis is unclear, or if there is a possibility of a treatable or reversible
condition. Patients with advanced diabetes who have heavy proteinuria and microvascular disease, such as retinopathy, but no active cellular components on a urinary sediment are generally presumed to have diabetic nephropathy. These patients
typically do not undergo renal biopsy because the nephrotic proteinuria represents
irreversible glomerular damage.
Treatment of nephrotic syndrome consists of treatment of the underlying disease,
if present, as well as management of the edema and attempts to limit the progression
of the renal disease. For edema, all patients require strict salt restriction, but most
patients will also need diuretics. Because both thiazide and loop diuretics are highly
protein bound, there is reduced delivery to the kidney, and often very large doses are
required to manage the edema. Counterintuitively for a patient with hypoproteinemia,
dietary protein restriction usually is recommended. It is thought that high-protein
intake only causes heavier proteinuria, which can have an adverse effect on renal
function.
Besides the edema, patients with nephrotic syndrome have other consequences
of renal protein wasting. They have decreased levels of antithrombin III and proteins
C and S, and often are hypercoagulable, with formation of venous thromboembolism, including renal vein thrombosis. Patients with evidence of thrombus formation

188

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

require anticoagulation, often for life. Other complications include hypogammaglobulinemia with increased infection risk (especially pneumococcal infection),
iron deficiency anemia caused by hypotransferrinemia, and vitamin D deficiency
because of loss of vitamin D–binding protein.
In the progression of diabetic nephropathy, initially the glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) is elevated and then declines over time. Prior to the decline in GFR, the
earliest stages of diabetic nephropathy can be detected as microalbuminuria. This
is defined as a urine albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/d. It is possible to
measure this in a random urine sample rather than a timed collection, because a
ratio of albumin (in milligrams) to creatinine (in grams) of 30 to 300 usually correlates with the total excretion described. When albuminuria exceeds 300 mg/d, it
is detectable on ordinary urine dipsticks (macroalbuminuria), and the patient is said
to have overt nephropathy.
After the development of microalbuminuria, most patients will remain asymptomatic, but the glomerulopathy will continue to progress over the subsequent 5 to
10 years until overt nephropathy develops. At this point, many patients have some
edema, and nearly all patients have developed hypertension. The presence of hypertension will markedly accelerate the decline of renal function. If left untreated,
patients then progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or
transplant, within a 5- to 15-year period.
The development of nephropathy and proteinuria is very significant because they
are associated with a much higher risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. By the time patients with diabetes
develop ESRD and require dialysis, the average life expectancy is less than 2 years.
Thus, the development of microalbuminuria in diabetic patients is extremely important because of the progressive disease it heralds.
Tight glycemic control with a goal hemoglobin A1c less than 6.5 to 7.0 has
been shown to slow or prevent the progression of renal disease in patients with
microalbuminuria Once macroalbuminuria has developed, however, it is not clear
whether improved glycemic control affects the course of renal disease. In addition,
as renal function declines, insulin requirements typically fall, and some oral
medications such as sulfonylureas and metformin can be dangerous in advanced
renal insufficiency.
Strict blood pressure control with a goal less than 130/80 mm Hg in all patients
with diabetes, or less than 125/75 mm Hg in patients with greater than 1 g/d proteinuria
is essential to slow progression.
Angiotensin inhibition, with either an ACE inhibitor or ARB, has been shown
to reduce the progression of renal disease independent of blood pressure control.
Although there are no good direct comparisons between the two classes of drugs,
most experts believe they are equivalent in patients with diabetes. If additional
blood pressure control is needed, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers,
beta-blockers, or diuretics may be added.
In addition, because cardiovascular disease is the major killer of patients with
diabetes, aggressive risk factor reduction should be attempted, including smoking
cessation and reduction of hypercholesterolemia. Patients with diabetes are regarded
as the highest risk category, and should be treated with diet and statins with a goal of

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL. If diabetic patients
are known to have atherosclerotic coronary disease, they should achieve an LDL
goal of less than 70 mg/dL.

ANSWERS
20.1 D. Beta-blockers are a good ﬁrst-choice agent for a patient with hypertension
and no comorbidities. However, for the patient with diabetes and nephropathy
described in the clinical vignette, the beneﬁt of an ACE inhibitor for decreasing proteinuria makes this the best choice for initial treatment. Changing from
one sulfonylurea to another is of no beneﬁt because all are equally efﬁcacious.
There is no indication for referral to a cardiologist based on the information
provided in the vignette.
20.2 C. The patient has hypertension, and urinary sediment consistent with
a nephritic rather than nephrotic syndrome (RBC casts, mild degree of
proteinuria). Given his recent episode of pharyngitis, the most likely cause
would be postinfectious, probably due to streptococcal infection. SLE can
produce a variety of renal diseases, including both nephritic and nephrotic
manifestions, but it would be unlikely in a male patient, especially without
other clinical manifestations of lupus such as arthritis. Amyloidosis, diabetes,
and HIV all cause renal disease, but usually produce the nephrotic syndrome
(heavy proteinuria >3 g/d, edema, hypoalbuminemia).
20.3 A. Although a 24-hour urine collection for creatinine may be useful in assessing declining GFR, it is not the best screening test for the diagnosis of early
diabetic nephropathy. In the outpatient setting, a dipstick urinalysis is readily
available but will detect only patients with overt nephropathy (proteinuria
>300 mg/d). Thus, a random urinary albumin/creatinine ratio of 30/300 is
the best test to screen for early diabetic nephropathy. A fasting blood glucose
may aid in the diagnosis of diabetes but not nephropathy. Finally, although
most patients with nephrotic syndrome require a renal biopsy for diagnosis,
a patient with worsening renal function who has had long-standing diabetes
is assumed to have renal disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy, and the
majority of these patients do not undergo a renal biopsy.
20.4 D. Patients with diabetes are considered at high risk for the development of
coronary artery disease, and should be treated with lipid-lowering agents such
as statins to achieve an LDL less than 100 mg/dL.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by more than 3.5 g proteinuria over
24 hours, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Often, hypercoagulability and
hyperlipidemia are present.



Nephrotic syndrome can be a result of a primary renal disease but is
often a manifestation of a systemic disease such as diabetes, HIV infection, an autoimmune disease, or a malignancy.



Patients with diabetes should be screened for microalbuminuria (albumin
excretion 30-300 mg/d); if present, treatment should be initiated with an
ACE inhibitor or ARB even if the patient is normotensive.



Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at very high risk for cardiovascular
disease, so aggressive risk factor reduction, such as use of statins, is
important, with a goal LDL less than 100 mg/dL.

CASE 21
A 48-year-old man comes to your office complaining of severe right knee pain for
8 hours. He states that the pain, which started abruptly at 2 AM and woke him from
sleep, was quite severe—so painful that even the weight of the bed sheets on his
knee was unbearable. By the morning, the knee had become warm, swollen, and
tender. He prefers to keep his knee bent, since straightening the knee causes the
pain to worsen. He has never had pain, surgery, or injury to his knees. A year ago,
he did have some pain and swelling at the base of his great toe on the left foot,
which was not as severe as this episode, and resolved in 2 or 3 days after taking ibuprofen. His only medical history is hypertension, which is controlled with
hydrochlorothiazide. He is a nonsmoker, and reports moderate social alcohol use.
On examination, his temperature is 99.4°F, heart rate 104 bpm, and blood pressure 136/78 mm Hg. His head and neck examinations are unremarkable, his chest
is clear, and his heart is tachycardic but regular, with no gallops or murmurs. His
right knee is swollen, with a moderate effusion, and appears erythematous, warm,
and very tender to palpation. He is unable to fully extend the knee because of pain.
He has no other joint swelling, pain, or deformity, and no skin rashes.

ANSWERS TO CASE 21:
Acute Monoarticular Arthritis—Gout
Summary: A 48-year-old hypertensive man complains of acute onset of severe
right knee pain of 8-hour duration. He denies previous pain, surgery, or injury to
his knees. One year ago, he had great toe pain and swelling for several days that
resolved with ibuprofen. His right knee is swollen, with a moderate effusion, and
appears erythematous, warm, and very tender to palpation. He is unable to fully
extend the knee because of pain. He has no other joint swelling, pain, or deformity,
and no skin rashes.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute monoarticular arthritis, likely crystalline or infectious, most likely gout because of history. (See considerations.)
• Next step: Aspiration of the knee joint to send fluid for cell count, culture, and
crystal analysis.
• Best initial treatment: If the joint fluid analysis is consistent with infection, he
needs drainage of the infected fluid by aspiration and administration of antibiotics. If analysis is suggestive of crystal-induced arthritis, he can be treated with
colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or corticosteroids.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the use of synovial fluid analysis to determine the etiology of
arthritis.
2. Know the stages of gout and the appropriate treatment for each stage.
3. Know about the similarities and differences between gout and pseudogout.

Considerations
A middle-aged man presents with an acute attack of monoarticular arthritis, as
evidenced by knee effusion, limited range of motion, and signs of inflammation
(low-grade fever, erythema, warmth, tenderness). The two most likely causes are infection (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) and crystalline arthritis (eg, gout or pseudogout). If
the patient is at risk, gonococcal arthritis is also a possibility. The previous less severe
episode involving his first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint sounds like podagra, the
most common presentation of gout. The rapid onset of severe symptoms during the
current attack is consistent with acute gouty arthritis. In this patient, the attack could
have been precipitated by the use of alcohol, which increases uric acid production,
and his use of thiazide diuretics, which decrease renal excretion of uric acid.
Although the first attack was typical of gout, which makes this episode very
likely to also be acute gouty arthritis, the current presentation is also consistent
with bacterial infection. Untreated septic arthritis could lead to rapid destruction of
the joint, so joint aspiration and empiric antibiotic therapy are appropriate until his
cultures and crystal analysis are available.

APPROACH TO :
Monoarticular Arthritis
DEFINITIONS
MONOARTHRITIS: Inflammation of a single joint.
GOUT: A disturbance of uric-acid metabolism occurring mainly in men, characterized by hyperuricemia and the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints,
as well as in connective tissues.
PSEUDOGOUT: Arthritis caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Almost any joint disorder may begin as monoarthritis; however, the primary concern is always infectious arthritis, because it may lead to joint destruction and
resultant severe morbidity. For that reason, acute monoarthritis should be considered a medical emergency and investigated and treated aggressively.
Accurate diagnosis starts with a good history and physical examination supplemented by additional diagnostic testing, such as synovial fluid analysis, radiography,
and occasionally synovial biopsy. Patients with crystal-induced arthritis may give
a history of recurrent, self-limited episodes. Precipitation of an attack by surgery or
some other stress can occur with both crystalline disorders, but gout is far more
common than is pseudogout. The clinical course can provide some clues to the
etiology: septic arthritis usually worsens unless treated; osteoarthritis worsens with
physical activity.
The location of joint involvement may be helpful. Gout most commonly involves
the first MTP joint (podagra), ankle, mid-foot, or knee. Pseudogout most commonly affects the large joints, such as the knee; it may also affect the wrist or the first
MTP joint (hence the name pseudogout). In gonococcal arthritis, there are often
migratory arthralgias and tenosynovitis, often involving the wrist and hands, associated with pustular skin lesions, before progressing to a purulent monoarthritis or
oligoarthritis. Nongonococcal causes of septic arthritis often involve large weightbearing joints, such as the knee and hip.
The basic approach in physical examination is to differentiate arthritis from
inflammatory conditions adjacent to the joint, such as cellulitis or bursitis. True
arthritis is characterized by swelling and redness around the joint, and painful
limitation of motion in all planes, during active and passive motion. Joint movement that is not limited by passive motion suggests a soft tissue disorder such as
bursitis rather than arthritis.
Diagnostic arthrocentesis is usually necessary when evaluating an acute monoarthritis and is essential when infection is suspected. Synovial fluid analysis helps to
differentiate between inflammatory and noninflammatory causes of arthritis. Fluid
analysis typically includes gross examination, cell count and differential, Gram
stain and culture, and crystal analysis. Table 21–1 gives the typical results that can
help one distinguish between noninflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis,

inflammatory arthritis such as crystalline disease, and septic arthritis, which is most
often a bacterial infection.
Normal joints contain a small amount of fluid that is essentially acellular. Noninflammatory effusions should have a white blood cell count less than 1000 to 2000/mm3
with less than 25% to 50% polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. If the fluid is inflammatory, the joint should be considered infected until proven otherwise, especially
if the patient is febrile.
Crystal analysis requires the use of a polarizing light microscope. Monosodium
urate crystals, the cause of gout, are needle-shaped, typically intracellular within a
PMN cell, and are negatively birefringent, appearing yellow under the polarizing
microscope. Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate (CPPD) crystals, the cause of pseudogout, are short and rhomboid, and are weakly positively birefringent, appearing
blue under polarized light. Even if crystals are seen, infection must be excluded
when the synovial fluid is inflammatory! Crystals and infection may coexist in the
same joint, and chronic arthritis or previous joint damage, such as occurs in gout,
may predispose that joint to hematogenous infection.
In septic arthritis, Gram stain and culture of the synovial fluid is positive in 60% to
80% of cases. False-negative results may be related to prior antibiotic use or fastidious
microorganisms. For example, in gonococcal arthritis, joint fluid cultures typically
are negative, whereas cultures of blood or the pustular skin lesions may be positive.
Sometimes, the diagnosis rests upon demonstration of gonococcal infection in another
site, such as urethritis, with the typical arthritis-dermatitis syndrome. Synovial biopsy
may be required when the cause of monoarthritis remains unclear, and is usually necessary to diagnose arthritis caused by tuberculosis or hemochromatosis.
Plain radiographs usually are unremarkable in cases of inflammatory arthritis; the
typical finding is soft tissue swelling. Chondrocalcinosis or linear calcium deposition
in joint cartilage suggests pseudogout.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

197

Generally, patients require initiation of treatment before all test results are available. When septic arthritis is suspected, the clinician should culture the joint fluid
and start antibiotic therapy; the antibiotic choice should be initially based on the
Gram stain and, when available, the culture results. If the Gram stain is negative, the
clinical picture should dictate antimicrobial selection. For example, if the patient
has the typical presentation of gonococcal arthritis, intravenous ceftriaxone is the
usual initial therapy, usually with rapid improvement in symptoms. Nongonococcal
septic arthritis usually is caused by gram-positive organisms, most often S aureus,
so treatment would involve an antistaphylococcal penicillin such as nafcillin, or
vancomycin when methicillin resistance is suspected. It is essential to drain the
purulent joint fluid, usually by repeated percutaneous aspiration. Open surgical
drainage or arthroscopy is required when joint fluid is loculated, or when shoulders,
hips, or sacroiliac joints are involved.
Gout classically progresses through four stages:
Stage 1 is asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Patients have elevated uric acid levels
without arthritis or kidney stones. The majority of patients with hyperuricemia
never develop any symptoms, but the higher the uric acid level and the longer the
duration of hyperuricemia, the greater the likelihood of the patient developing
gouty arthritis.
Stage 2 is acute gouty arthritis, which most often involves the acute onset of severe
monoarticular pain, often occurring at night, in the first MTP joint, ankle, or knee,
with rapid development of joint swelling and erythema and sometimes associated
with systemic symptoms such as fever and chills. This usually follows decades of
asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Attacks may last hours or up to 2 weeks.
Stage 3 is intercritical gout, or the period between acute attacks. Patients are generally completely asymptomatic. However, 60% to 70% of patients will have another
acute attack within 1 to 2 years. The presence of these completely asymptomatic
periods between monoarthritic attacks is so uncommon, except in crystalline arthritis, that it is often used as a diagnostic criterion for gout.
Stage 4 is chronic tophaceous gout, which usually occurs after 10 or more years
of acute intermittent gout. In this stage, the intercritical periods are no longer
asymptomatic; the involved joints now have chronic swelling and discomfort,
which worsens over time. Patients also develop subcutaneous tophaceous deposits
of monosodium urate.
In general, asymptomatic hyperuricemia requires no specific treatment. Lowering the urate level does not necessarily prevent the development of gout, and most of
these patients will never develop any symptoms. Acute gouty arthritis is treated with
therapies to reduce the inflammatory reaction to the presence of the crystals, all of
which are most effective if started early in the attack. Potent NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, are the mainstay of therapy during an acute attack. Alternatively, oral
colchicine can be taken TID until the joint symptoms abate, but dosing is limited
by gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhea. Individuals affected by
acute joint pain with renal insufficiency, for which a NSAID or colchicine is relatively contraindicated, usually benefit from intraarticular glucocorticoid injection
or oral steroid therapy. Steroids should be used only if infection has been excluded.

198

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Treatment to lower uric acid levels is inappropriate during an acute episode because
any sudden increase or decrease in urate levels may precipitate further attacks.
During intercritical gout, the focus shifts to preventing further attacks by lowering
uric acid levels to less than 6.0 mg/dL. Dietary restriction is mainly aimed at avoiding organ-rich foods, such as liver, and avoiding alcohol. Patients taking thiazide
diuretics should be switched to another antihypertensive if possible. Urate lowering can be accomplished by therapy to increase uric acid excretion by the kidney,
such as with probenecid. Uricosuric agents such as this are ineffective in patients
with renal failure, however, and are contraindicated in patients with a history of
uric acid kidney stones. In these patients, allopurinol can be used to diminish uric
acid production, but given at lower doses in patients with renal disease. Febuxostat
is a new xanthine oxidase inhibitor that does not require dose adjustment in renal
insufficiency.
Patients with tophaceous gout are managed as previously described during acute
attacks and subsequently treated with allopurinol to help tophaceous deposits
resolve. Surgery may be indicated if the mass effect of tophi causes nerve compression, joint deformity, or chronic skin ulceration with resultant infection.
Patients with pseudogout are treated similarly for acute attacks (NSAIDs, colchicine, systemic or intraarticular steroids). Prophylaxis with colchicine may be helpful in patients with chronic recurrent attacks, but there is no effective therapy for
preventing CPPD crystal formation or deposition.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
21.1 A previously healthy 18-year-old college freshman presents to the student
health clinic complaining of pain on the dorsum of her left wrist and in her
right ankle, fever, and a pustular rash on the extensor surfaces of both her
forearms. She has mild swelling and erythema of her ankle, and pain on passive
ﬂexion of her wrist. Less than 1 mL of joint ﬂuid is aspirated from her ankle,
which shows 8000 polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells per high-power ﬁeld (hpf)
but no organisms on Gram stain. Which of the following is the best initial
treatment?
A. Indomethacin orally
B. Intravenous ampicillin
C. Colchicine orally
D. Intraarticular prednisone
E. Intravenous ceftriaxone
21.2 Which of the following diagnostic tests is most likely to give the diagnosis for
the case in Question 21.1?
A. Crystal analysis of the joint fluid
B. Culture of joint fluid
C. Blood culture
D. Cervical culture

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

199

21.3 A 30-year-old man is noted to have an acutely swollen and red knee. Joint
aspirate reveals numerous leukocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes,
but no organisms on Gram stain. Analysis shows few negatively birefringent
crystals. Which of the following is the best initial treatment?
A. Oral corticosteroids
B. Intraarticular corticosteroids
C. Intravenous antibiotic therapy
D. Oral colchicine

ANSWERS
21.1 E. The patient described best ﬁts the picture of disseminated gonococcal infection. She has the rash, which typically is located on extensor surfaces of distal
extremities. Pain on passive ﬂexion of her wrist indicates likely tenosynovitis
of that area. The ﬂuid is inﬂammatory, but gonococci are typically not seen
on Gram stain. Ceftriaxone is the usual treatment of choice for gonococcal
infection. Nafcillin would be useful for staphylococcal arthritis and would be
the more likely choice if she were older, had some chronic joint disease such
as rheumatoid arthritis, or were immunocompromised. Gonococcal arthritis
is the most common cause of infectious arthritis in patients younger than
40 years. Indomethacin or colchicine would be useful if she had a crystalline
arthritis, but that is unlikely in this clinical picture. Intraarticular prednisone
is contraindicated until infectious arthritis is ruled out.
21.2 D. Synovial ﬂuid cultures usually are sterile in gonococcal arthritis (in fact,
the arthritis is more likely caused by immune complex deposition than by
actual joint infection), and blood cultures are positive less than 50% of the
time. Diagnosis is more often made by ﬁnding gonococcal infection in a more
typical site, such as urethra, cervix, or pharynx.
21.3 C. Corticosteroids should not be used until infection is ruled out. The inﬂammatory arthritis as shown by Gram stain of the joint aspirate is suspicious for
infection, even with no organisms seen on Gram stain. Also, the presence of a
few crystals does not eliminate an infection.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

CLINICAL PEARLS


In the absence of trauma, acute monoarthritis is most likely to be caused
by septic or crystalline arthritis.



In a febrile patient with a joint effusion, diagnostic arthrocentesis is mandatory. Inflammatory fluid (white blood cell count more than 2000/mm3)
should be considered infected until proven otherwise.



Gonococcal arthritis usually presents as a migratory tenosynovitis, often
involving the wrists and hands, with few vesiculopustular skin lesions.



Nongonococcal septic arthritis is most often caused by S aureus and
most often affects large weight-bearing joints.



Monosodium urate crystals in gout are needle-shaped and negatively
birefringent (yellow) under the polarizing microscope. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in pseudogout are rhomboid and positively
birefringent (blue).



Treatment of gout depends on the stage: NSAIDs, specifically indomethacin colchicine, or steroids for an acute gouty arthritis, and urate lowering
with probenecid or allopurinol during the intercritical period.

CASE 22
A 32-year-old nurse presents to your office with a complaint of intermittent
episodes of pain, stiffness, and swelling in both hands and wrists for approximately 1 year. The episodes last for several weeks and then resolve. More recently,
she noticed similar symptoms in her knees and ankles. Joint pain and stiffness
are making it harder for her to get out of bed in the morning and are interfering
with her ability to perform her duties at work. The joint stiffness usually lasts for
several hours before improving. She also reports malaise and easy fatigability for
the past few months, but she denies having fever, chills, skin rashes, and weight
loss. Physical examination reveals a well-developed woman, with blood pressure
120/70 mm Hg, heart rate 82 bpm, and respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. Her
skin does not reveal any rashes. Head, neck, cardiovascular, chest, and abdominal
examinations are normal. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The joint examination
reveals the presence of bilateral swelling, redness, and tenderness of most proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, the wrists, and the
knees. Laboratory studies show a mild anemia with hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit
32.5%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 85.7 fL, white blood cell (WBC) count 7.9/mm3
with a normal differential, and platelet count 300 000/mm3. The urinalysis is clear
with no protein and no red blood cells (RBCs). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) is 75 mm/h, and the kidney and liver function tests are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 22:
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Summary: This is a 32-year-old woman with a 1-year history of symmetric polyarticular
arthritis and morning stiffness. Joint examination reveals the presence of bilateral
swelling, redness, and tenderness of her PIP joints, MCP joints, wrists, and knees.
She has a mild normocytic anemia with an otherwise normal complete blood count
(CBC). Urinalysis, renal, and liver function tests are normal. The ESR is elevated,
suggesting an inflammatory cause of her arthritis.
• Most likely diagnosis: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
• Next diagnostic step: Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody titer

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Discern between the clinical presentation of RA and other symmetric polyarthritis
syndromes.
2. Learn about the clinical course and treatment of RA.

Considerations
This patient’s history, including the symmetric peripheral polyarthritis and duration
of symptoms, is suggestive of RA. Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune
disorder of unknown etiology. Its major distinctive feature is a chronic, symmetric,
and erosive synovitis of peripheral joints, which, if untreated, leads to deformity and
destruction of joints due to erosion of cartilage and bone. The diagnosis of RA is a
clinical one, based on the presence of a combination of clinical findings, laboratory
abnormalities, and radiographic erosions.

APPROACH TO:
Polyarticular Arthritis
CLINICAL APPROACH
The first and most important step in evaluating a patient with polyarticular joint
pain is determining whether or not synovitis/arthritis is present, producing soft tissue swelling, joint effusion, tenderness, warmth of the joint, and limitation of both
active and passive range of motion. If the only finding is pain without inflammatory
changes, then the diagnostic considerations include noninflammatory diseases such
as osteoarthritis (OA), fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain, and depression. The presence of soft tissue swelling and tenderness with limited active range
of motion but normal passive range of motion suggests the problem is extraarticular
soft tissue inflammation, such as bursitis or tendonitis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

203

If there is active synovitis/arthritis, it is clinically useful to distinguish between
monoarticular/oligoarticular arthritis (see Case 21) and polyarticular arthritis. In
polyarticular disease, the next diagnostic clue is the duration of symptoms. If symptoms are relatively acute (<6 weeks), the major considerations are arthritis due to
viral infection (such as hepatitis B or C, rubella, or parvovirus B19) or the earliest
manifestation of a true rheumatic disease. Viral serologies and compatible clinical
history of exposure often can make the diagnosis at this point and obviate need for
further rheumatologic evaluation. Treatment of a viral arthritis usually is limited to
symptom relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because the
conditions are generally self-limited.
Symmetric peripheral polyarthritis is the most characteristic feature of RA.
Other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
and psoriatic arthritis, are often asymmetric. Lupus, which may present with a symmetric polyarthritis, usually is characterized by the presence of other symptoms, such
as malar rash, serositis (pleuritis and pericarditis), renal disease with proteinuria or
hematuria, central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, as well as hematologic disorders, such as hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, or thrombocytopenia.
Rheumatic fever, which can cause symmetric polyarthritis, is an acute febrile illness
lasting only 6 to 8 weeks. In psoriatic arthritis the pattern of joint involvement
varies widely. The vast majority of patients have peripheral joint involvement of
more than five joints. Others have a pauciarticular asymmetric arthritis or exclusive
distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement. Inflammation is not limited to the joints
but also occurs at the periosteum, along tendons, and at the insertion points into
the bone, resulting in the development of “sausage digits,” which are typical of
psoriatic arthritis (and Reiter syndrome). Although the arthritis can precede the
development of a skin rash, the definite diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis cannot be
made without the evidence of skin or nail changes typical of psoriasis (nail pitting,
scaly plaques). Reactive arthritis is an asymmetric inflammatory arthritis that follows
infection of the gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract with bacteria such
as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, or Chlamydia. Reiter syndrome is a
form of reactive arthritis with the triad of arthritis, uveitis, and urethritis.
The peripheral polyarthritis of RA most typically involves the wrists and the
MCP or PIP joints of both hands; the DIP joints usually are spared. It is useful to
contrast the typical pattern of joint involvement of RA from that of degenerative
OA. Degenerative joint disease may affect multiple joints, but it occurs in older age
groups, is usually not associated with inflammation or constitutional symptoms, and
tends not to be episodic. Also, in OA the hand joints most commonly involved are
the DIP joints, where the formation of Heberden nodes can be noted (Figure 22–1).
In RA, ulnar deviation of the MCP joints is often associated with radial deviation
of the wrists; swan-neck deformities can develop as well as the boutonnière deformity (Figure 22–2). Swan-neck deformity results from contracture of the interosseous and flexor muscles and tendons, which causes a flexion contracture of the MCP
joint, hyperextension of the PIP joint, and flexion of the DIP joint. In the boutonnière deformity, there is a flexion of the PIP and hyperextension of the DIP joints.
These findings are typical of advanced RA.

inflammation.

Rheumatoid nodules are subcutaneous nodules typically found over extensor surfaces of the proximal ulna or other pressure points. They only occur in 20% to 30%
of patients with RA but are believed to have a high diagnostic specificity for RA.
Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are immunoglobulins that react to the FC portion
of immunoglobulin (Ig)G molecules. The usual serologic tests used in clinical
laboratories detect IgM RFs, which are found in 80% to 85% of patients with RA.
Rheumatoid factor is not specific for RA, as it is found in 5% of healthy patients,
but it can support the diagnosis when clinical features are suggestive. High RF titers
have a prognostic utility for more severe systemic and progressive disease.
Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) are now recognized as very
useful biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic significance. Anti-CCP antibodies
have the same sensitivity as RF, but are highly specific, about 95%. The presence of
anti-CCP also portends worse outcomes in RA.
Radiologic findings in RA, such as erosion of periarticular bone and cartilage
destruction with loss of joint space, may help the diagnosis. On x-rays, the typical
findings are joint space narrowing, subchondral polysclerosis, marginal osteophyte
formation, and cyst formation. Usually, though, the typical x-ray findings do not
develop until later in the disease process after a diagnosis has been made based on
clinical findings. Joint deformities in RA occur from several different mechanisms,
all related to synovitis and pannus formation with resulting cartilage destruction and
erosion of periarticular bone. The structural damage to the joint is irreversible and
worsens with disease progression. Multiple different joints may be affected, such as
hand, foot, ankle, hip, shoulders, elbow, and cervical spine.
There are several extraarticular manifestations in RA, including vasculitic lesions
with the development of ischemic ulcers, which implies systemic involvement; ocular
manifestations with symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Sjögren syndrome);

respiratory manifestations caused by interstitial lung disease; cardiac manifestations; and several neurologic manifestations, such as myelopathy, related to cervical
spine instability. Although not common, the continuous bone erosion may result in
an atlantoaxial subluxation with cervical dislocation and spinal cord compression.
Entrapment neuropathy may develop, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Hematologic
manifestations include anemia, typically anemia of chronic disease. The combination of RA, splenomegaly, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, and thrombocytopenia
is called Felty syndrome. Felty syndrome is most common with severe noduleforming RA.
At this stage in the disease process, our patient is presenting with joint complaints, fatigue, and malaise. No other extraarticular manifestations have developed
yet. At the very onset of RA, the characteristic symmetric inflammation of the
joints and the typical serologic findings may not be evident. Therefore, initially
distinguishing RA from other conditions, such as lupus, may be difficult. Usually,
the development of extraarticular phenomenon allows the physician to make a more
specific diagnosis.

Treatment
Several drugs are currently used for treatment of RA. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors such as celecoxib may
control local inflammatory symptoms. Corticosteroids have an immediate and
dramatic effect on joint symptoms, but were historically thought not to alter the
natural progression of the disease. Recent evidence suggests that low-dose corticosteroids may retard the progression of bone erosions.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may have a favorable
impact on the natural course of the disease, reducing joint inflammation and disease activity, and improving functional status in patients with RA. The nonbiologic
DMARDs include methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, minocycline,
and leflunomide. There is controversy regarding which DMARD is the most effective, but methotrexate is often used as the first drug of choice because of its rapid
onset of action and higher tolerability and patient compliance. Toxicity of the various DMARDs is often the most important determinant of which drug is used, and if
the patient fails to respond or develops unacceptable side effects, the patient may be
tried on a different agent.
In the last decade, the biologic DMARDs have revolutionized the treatment of
RA. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) have been found to reduce disease activity within weeks, unlike other
DMARDs, which may take several months to act, and may also control signs and
symptoms in patients who have failed conventional DMARD therapy. Side effects of
TNF blockers may include increased risk of infection, such as reactivation tuberculosis, so all patients should first be screened for latent TB. Other biologics currently
in use include anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, abatacept, a soluble fusion protein of IgG and human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4
(CTLA-4), and rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, a cellsurface molecule of B-lymphocytes.

22.4 A 22-year-old man presents with complaints of low back pain for 3 to 4 months
and stiffness of the lumbar area, which worsen with inactivity. He reports difﬁculty in getting out of bed in the morning and may have to roll out sideways,
trying not to ﬂex or rotate the spine to minimize pain. A lumbosacral (LS)
spine x-ray ﬁlm would most likely show which of the following?
A. Degenerative joint disease with spur formation

wrists, and knees. She is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Which of the
following treatments will reduce joint inﬂammation and slow progression of
the disease?
A. NSAIDs
B. Joint aspiration
C. Methotrexate
D. Systemic corticosteroids

ANSWERS
22.1 E. Pseudogout is diagnosed by positive birefringent crystals.
22.2 B. The involvement of the great toe is most likely gout, and the synovial ﬂuid
is likely to show needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals.
22.3 A. This history is suggestive of gonococcal arthritis, and the rash is suggestive
of disseminated gonococcal disease. The synovial ﬂuid would most likely show
an acute inﬂammatory exudate, WBCs 72 000/mm3 with 75% polymorphonuclear cells.
22.4 B. A young man is not likely to have osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, or compression fractures. His morning stiffness, which worsens with rest, suggests an
inﬂammatory arthritis, such as ankylosing spondylitis, which would include
sacroiliitis with increased sclerosis around the sacroiliac joints.
22.5 C. Although NSAIDs and corticosteroids may help to relieve symptoms,
they typically do not alter the disease course signiﬁcantly. Disease-modifying
mediations include methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, oral and
parenteral gold, and penicillamine. Of these agents, methotrexate is thought
to be the ﬁrst line.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by the insidious onset of symmetric polyarthritis and extraarticular
symptoms.



Rheumatoid factor is found in the serum of 85% of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis.



In nearly all patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the wrist, metacarpophalangeal
joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints are affected, whereas the distal
interphalangeal joints are spared.



Distal interphalangeal joints and large weight-bearing joints are most
commonly involved in osteoarthritis.



The typical x-ray finding in rheumatoid arthritis—periarticular bone erosion
(loss of joint space)—may not develop until later in the disease process,
when the diagnosis has already been made based on clinical findings.



DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis includes methotrexate and TNF
antagonists.

CASE 23
A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse is brought to the emergency
room complaining of nausea and vomiting and mild abdominal pain. He had been
on a 5-day drinking binge until the onset of these symptoms. He has no other
medical history and was taking no other drugs and no medications.
On examination, he is sleeping on the stretcher but is easily arousable. He is
afebrile with a pulse rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure 122/72 mm Hg, and respiratory
rate of 18 breaths per minute. His breath has a strong odor of alcohol. His eyes are
bloodshot but anicteric, his chest is clear to auscultation, and his heart is tachycardic but regular in rhythm, and no murmurs are appreciated. His abdominal
examination is significant for mild epigastric tenderness with hypoactive bowel
sounds, but no guarding or tenderness is noted. He has peripheral edema, and no
focal neurologic deficits.
Initial labs show sodium 145 mEq/L, potassium 5.0 mEq/L, chloride 105 mEq/L,
and bicarbonate 14 mEq/L, with BUN 20 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.5 mg/dL. Serum
glucose is 142 mg/dL. A serum Acetest is weakly positive for ketones. Urinalysis
shows ketonuria but no glycosuria and no cells, casts, or crystals. Urine drug
screen is negative, and abdominal x-rays show a normal bowel gas pattern with no
signs of obstruction.

ANSWERS TO CASE 23:
Alcoholic Ketoacidosis
Summary: A 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse is brought to the emergency room with nausea and vomiting after a prolonged drinking binge. His physical
examination is significant only for tachycardia and mild epigastric tenderness. His
lab studies are most significant for a low serum bicarbonate level, suggestive of an
acidotic state. The Acetest is weakly positive for ketones, but his serum glucose is
not elevated.
• Most likely diagnosis: Alcoholic ketoacidosis
• Best initial treatment: Infusion of 5% dextrose with 0.9% saline

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand how to diagnose and classify simple acid-base disorders.
2. Know how to calculate the anion gap (AG), and how to manage the causes of
high AG acidosis.
3. Understand the two causes of nongap acidosis (bicarbonate losses from the GI
tract and renal tubular acidosis).
4. Understand how to discriminate between saline-responsive and saline-resistant
metabolic alkalosis.

Considerations
The most significant finding in this case is an apparent acidosis with an elevated
anion gap, which will be discussed later. In this patient with a history of alcoholism
and an alcohol binge, alcoholic ketoacidosis is most likely, but one must also consider
the possibility of other ingestions (methanol, ethylene glycol), either accidental or
intentional, that would also present with similar laboratory findings, but may be
more serious or even fatal.

APPROACH TO:
Alcoholic Ketoacidosis
DEFINITIONS
Anion gap (AG) = [Na+] – [Cl−+ HCO3−]. An estimation of unmeasured anions in
the plasma (phosphate, sulfate, organic acids).
Osmolal gap: The difference between the measured and calculated serum osmolality. If
elevated (eg, >10 mOsm), then suggestive of the presence of significant serum concentration of an additional osmotically active solute such as methanol or ethylene
glycol.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

213

Urine anion gap (UAG) = urine [Na+ + K+] – urine [Cl−]. An estimation of urinary
ammonium ion (NH4+) excretion.

CLINICAL APPROACH
In normal physiology, systemic pH is maintained between 7.35 and 7.45. The main
homeostatic mechanisms are respiratory and renal. Under normal conditions, body
CO2 production is relatively stable, and CO2 excretion by the respiratory system
keeps the arterial CO2 tension around 40 mm Hg. The main renal mechanisms
for maintaining normal pH are the reabsorption of filtered HCO3− in the proximal
tubule, and excretion of NH4+ in the distal tubule. Disturbances in one of these
systems cause a compensatory change in the other system. For instance, the development of a metabolic acidosis would stimulate the respiratory system to increase
the ventilation and lower the PaCO2 so that the HCO3− :PaCO2 ratio and thus the
pH would move toward but not quite to normal. Simple acid-base disorders can be
classified and understood using the pH, the PaCO2, and the HCO3− (see Table 23–1).

Metabolic Acidosis
If metabolic acidosis is evident, the first step in evaluating the cause is to calculate
the anion gap (AG). The AG represents unmeasured anions in the plasma including phosphates, sulfates, organic anions, as well as anionic proteins such as albumin.
The normal AG is usually 10 to 12 mmol/L. When evaluating the AG, one should
remember the role of charged proteins. The calculated AG will be lowered if patients
are hypoalbuminemic as in nephrotic syndrome (decreased anionic albumin), or if
there are high levels of immunoglobulins as in multiple myeloma (increased cationic
paraproteins). The causes of high AG metabolic acidosis are listed in Table 23–2.
Lactic acidosis most commonly occurs in the setting of an acute illness with poor
tissue perfusion such as septic shock, heart failure, severe anemia, or poisoning
affecting tissue oxygen delivery or cellular respiration (carbon monoxide, cyanide).
Treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying condition. Sodium bicarbonate may
be used in severe acidemia (pH <7.1).
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is caused by insulin deficiency with increased
lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism, with accumulation of the ketoacids acetoacetate
and β-hydroxybutyrate. Diagnosis and treatment of DKA is discussed in Case 43.
In alcoholic ketoacidosis, decreased carbohydrate intake reduces insulin secretion,
and alcohol-induced inhibition of gluconeogenesis leads to stimulation of lipolysis and
contributes to increased ketoacid formation, predominantly β-hydroxybutyrate. The
nitroprusside reaction test to detect serum ketones (Acetest) can detect acetoacetate,

but not β-hydroxybutyrate, so the nitroprusside reaction may only be weakly positive, and can lead one to underestimate the degree of ketosis. With treatment, as the
patient improves, the formation of acetoacetate is favored, so the degree of measured
ketosis may appear to paradoxically worsen. In contrast to the markedly elevated
glucose levels in DKA, the plasma glucose concentration in alcoholic ketoacidosis
may be low, normal, or somewhat elevated. In alcoholic or fasting ketoacidosis, the
primary treatment is administration of dextrose and saline solutions; the dextrose will
increase insulin secretion and reduce lipolysis, along with saline to replenish fluid deficits. Electrolyte deficiencies such as hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia are also common, and should be corrected. In alcoholics, thiamine 100 mg
should be administered prior to any glucose-containing solution to decrease the risk
of precipitating Wernicke encephalopathy or Korsakoff syndrome.
In a patient with an elevated AG acidosis and a suggestive social history, one must
also consider the possibility of other ingestions, such as methanol or ethylene glycol.
Methanol and ethylene glycol are frequently found in high concentration in automotive antifreeze and deicing solutions, windshield wiper fluid, and other solvents. They
may be ingested as a substitute for ethanol, by accident, or intentionally, for example,
in a suicide attempt. Methanol is metabolized via the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)
enzyme to formaldehyde and formic acid, causing optic nerve and CNS injury.
Ethylene glycol is metabolized by ADH to glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate and can
cause acute renal failure due to glycolate-induced damage to tubules, and tubular
obstruction from precipitated oxalate crystals. If either of these ingestions is suspected,
direct lab assays of the substances are not usually available, so their presence may be
inferred by an elevated osmolal gap. Serum osmolality is primarily determined by
solutes that can be directly measured: sodium, glucose, and urea. Other unmeasured
solutes, especially low-molecular weight substances such as methanol will also affect
osmolality. Serum osmolality can be calculated using the following formula:
SmOsm = (2 × [Na]) + [glucose, in mg/dL]/18 + [BUN, in mg/dL]/2.8.
If the difference between the directly measured serum osmolality and the calculated serum osmolality is greater than 10, then the presence of another solute is

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

215

suspected. Ethanol itself can be directly measured in most labs, so a patient with
a suspicious ingestion with a high AG acidosis, elevated osmolar gap, and low or
absent blood alcohol level may be suspected to have methanol or ethylene glycol
ingestion. If ethylene glycol is suspected, one may also examine the urine for
oxalate crystals. For either methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion, therapy includes
the administration of fomepizole, an ADH inhibitor that reduces the formation of
the toxic metabolites.
Non-AG metabolic acidosis: Causes of non-AG metabolic acidosis are listed
in Table 23–3. With bicarbonate losses from the GI tract or kidney, there is a rise
in chloride concentration that approximates the fall in bicarbonate concentration
(hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis), so the AG remains normal. Most GI causes
can be elicited by the clinical history (diarrhea, external pancreatic, biliary, or
small bowel drainage). In patients with diarrhea and hypokalemia, renal synthesis
and secretion of ammonia is stimulated, causing a buffering of the urine with a pH
greater than 5.5 (higher than expected in acidosis). Acidosis with high urine pH
due to GI losses (has high urinary NH4+ ) can be differentiated from RTA (has low
urinary NH4+) by assessing urinary NH4+ excretion. Urine NH4+ cannot be directly
measured, but it can be estimated with the urine anion gap (UAG).
When [Na + K] − [Cl] is negative (usually −20 to −50 mEq/L), then urinary
NH4+ is appropriately increased, suggesting a GI or extrarenal cause of acidosis.
When the UAG is positive, it suggests impaired NH4+ excretion. Causes include
distal (type 1) RTA, hypoaldosteronism, or type 4 RTA. In patients with advanced
chronic kidney disease, decline in functional renal mass also causes a proportional
reduction in renal NH4+ excretion.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Distal or type 1 RTA in adults is most commonly caused by autoimmune diseases
such as Sjogren syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis. Patients have a high urine pH,
and often have hypokalemia. Most patients have hypocitraturia and hypercalciuria,
so kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis commonly occur. Treatment usually involves
alkalinization and citrate supplementation with sodium or potassium citrate to normalize pH and prevent stone formation.
Type 4 RTA is due to generalized distal nephron dysfunction, and is commonly
seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Low plasma renin activity is common
in diabetic patients, leading to hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. Patients typically present with hyperkalemia and a mild hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
The hyperkalemia is usually managed with a low potassium diet and use of loop or
thiazide diuretics.

Respiratory Acidosis
Respiratory acidosis can occur acutely or chronically. The pathophysiology is reduction in minute ventilation leading to rising PaCO2 and falling pH. Renal adaptation
occurs, with increased reabsorption of HCO3−. In a chronic compensated state, the
HCO3− increases 4 mmol/L for every 10 mm Hg increase in PaCO2. The most common cause of acute respiratory acidosis in hospitalized patients is drug-induced respiratory depression with hypoventilation, due to narcotics, sedatives, or anesthesia.
The most common cause of chronic respiratory acidosis is COPD. Many of these
patients live with chronic elevations of PaCO2 of 50 mm Hg or higher.

Respiratory Alkalosis
This condition most often occurs acutely, with increased respiratory rate and tidal
volume, leading to an acute fall in PaCO2 and rise in pH. It can be a response to any
disease that causes hypoxia, such as a pulmonary embolism, but is also often seen
as a manifestation of an anxiety disorder with hyperventilation. Hypocapnia causes
decreased cerebral blood flow, so symptoms manifest as lightheadedness or dizziness.
With acute alkalosis, there is increased affinity between albumin and calcium, so
more calcium becomes protein bound. Patients may then experience symptoms of
hypocalcemia (perioral numbness, paresthesias).

Metabolic Alkalosis
Metabolic alkalosis most often occurs when there is loss of acid or excess endogenous production of HCO3− by the kidney. Under normal physiologic circumstances,
the kidney can excrete very high quantities of HCO3−, so for a metabolic alkalosis
to be maintained, there must be some impairment in their normal ability to excrete
excess alkali. The kidneys will retain rather than excrete excess HCO3− under the
following common conditions:
1. Hyperaldosteronism causes increased tubular reabsorption of Na+ and HCO3−,
and excessive loss of Cl− in the urine (urine chloride >20 mEq/L).
2. ECF volume contraction and hypokalemia due to various causes (vomiting, nasogastric suction, diuretics), causing augmented distal H+ secretion (urine chloride
<10 mEq/L).

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

217

In the first circumstance, correction of the metabolic alkalosis requires treatment
of the underlying condition (eg, primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, Cushing
syndrome). This alkalosis is termed “chloride resistant” or “saline resistant,” meaning that it cannot be corrected by the administration of sodium chloride solution.
In the second circumstance, correction of hypokalemia and administration of
saline solution to restore ECF volume are usually sufficient to reverse the alkalosis.
This alkalosis is termed “chloride responsive” or “saline responsive.”

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
23.1 A 34-year-old woman presents to your ofﬁce for a checkup. Her only medical
history is recurrent kidney stones. She is currently asymptomatic. Her labs
show Na 136, K 3.0, Cl 110, HCO3 16, creatinine 1.0, and glucose 110. Her
urine pH is 6.5. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bulimia with chronic hypokalemia
B. Ethylene glycol ingestion with calcium oxalate stones
C. Type 1 distal RTA
D. Type 4 RTA due to diabetic kidney disease
23.2 Which of the following urine electrolytes is most useful in estimating the ECF
volume status of a patient with metabolic alkalosis?
A. Urine Na
B. Urine Cl
C. Urine urea
D. Urine anion gap
23.3 A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency room obtunded and unable to
give a history. He is afebrile and normotensive. He has edema of the optic disc,
and his neurologic examination does not reveal any focal neurologic deﬁcits.
His labs include pH 7.25, PaCO2 23, Na 145, K 5.3, Cl 105, HCO3 10, BUN 25,
creatinine 1.3, and glucose 80. His measured serum osmolality is 335 mOsm,
and his blood alcohol level is 0. Urinalysis shows no crystals. What is the most
likely cause of his mental status and acidemia?
A. Ethanol intoxication
B. Acute stroke with hypoventilation
C. Methanol intoxication
D. Ethylene glycol intoxication

218

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
23.1 C. She has a non-AG acidosis with alkaline urine, suggestive of RTA. Patients
with type 1 RTA tend toward hypokalemia, whereas type 4 RTA has hyperkalemia.
With alkaline urine and hypercalciuria, patients are predisposed to recurrent
calcium phosphate stones. Vomiting from bulimia might cause metabolic alkalosis.
Ethylene glycol would cause AG acidosis.
23.2 B. Urine chloride is useful for judging the volume status of patients with
metabolic alkalosis, and is used to classify them as either volume depleted (low
urine Cl) or volume repleted (high urine Cl). If low urine chloride, they are
considered chloride responsive, and the alkalosis can be corrected with the
infusion of saline. Urine Na is not a good indicator of volume status, since
urinary HCO3 losses will force a certain amount of Na with it.
23.3 C. The patient has a high AG metabolic acidosis. He has a high osmolal
gap, but his ethanol level is undetectable. The most likely intoxication is
methanol, which is metabolized to formic acid. This toxic metabolite causes
mental status depression, papilledema, optic neuritis, and metabolic acidosis.
Hypoventilation would cause respiratory acidosis. Ethylene glycol may cause
the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Causes of AG metabolic acidosis include: lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis,
toxic ingestion, and renal failure.



In AG acidosis, a large osmolal gap (>10) can be caused by ingestion of
methanol or ethylene glycol.



In non-AG acidosis, positive urine anion gap is suggestive of RTA, and negative urine anion gap is consistent with extrarenal (GI) cause of acidosis.



Patients with respiratory alkalosis may experience symptoms of cerebral
vasoconstriction (dizziness) and transient hypocalcemia (perioral numbness and paresthesias).



In metabolic alkalosis, low urine chloride can determine that the alkalosis
can be corrected by saline infusion (chloride responsive).

CASE 24
An obese 35-year-old housekeeper presents with low back pain and requests an
x-ray. She has had this pain off and on for several years; however, for the past
2 days it is worse than it has ever been. It started after she vigorously vacuumed
a rug, is primarily on the right lower side, radiates down her posterior right thigh
to her knee, but is not associated with any numbness or tingling. It is relieved by
laying flat on her back with her legs slightly elevated and lessened somewhat when
she takes ibuprofen 400 mg. Except for moderate obesity and difficulty maneuvering onto the examination table because of pain, her examination is fairly normal.
The only abnormalities you note are a positive straight leg raise test, with raising
the right leg eliciting more pain than the left. Her strength, sensation, and deep

ANSWERS TO CASE 24:
Low Back Pain
Summary: An obese 35-year-old woman with acute worsening of chronic low back
pain complains of shooting pain down her right leg. Her physical examination is
normal.
• Most likely diagnosis: Musculoskeletal low back pain, possible sciatica without
neurologic deficits.
• Next step: Encourage continuation of usual activity, avoiding twisting motions
or heavy lifting. Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a scheduled basis; you can also recommend muscle relaxants, although these drugs may
cause sleepiness. Massage or physical therapy might be helpful. Follow-up in
4 weeks. Long-term advice includes weight loss and back-strengthening exercises.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the history and physical examination findings that help to distinguish
benign musculoskeletal low back pain from more serious causes of low back pain.
2. Understand the variety of treatment options and their effectiveness in low back
pain.
3. Learn the judicious use of laboratory and imaging tests in evaluating low back
pain.

Considerations
This young patient with chronic back pain has an acute exacerbation with pain
radiating down her leg, which may indicate possible sciatic nerve compression. She
has no other neurologic abnormalities, such as sensory deficits, motor weakness, or
“red flag” symptoms of more serious etiologies of back pain, which if present would
demand a more urgent evaluation. Thus, this individual has a good prognosis for
recovery with conservative therapy, perhaps time being the most important factor. If
she does not improve after 6 weeks, then imaging studies can be considered.

APPROACH TO:
Low Back Pain
DEFINITIONS
CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME: Lower back pain, saddle anesthesia, and bowel
or bladder dysfunction with possible lower extremity weakness and loss of reflexes
caused by compression of multiple sacral nerve roots. Cauda equina syndrome is a
surgical emergency.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

221

SCIATICA: Pain in the distribution of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots, with or
without motor or sensory deficits.
SPONDYLOLISTHESIS: Anterior displacement of an upper vertebral body on
the lower body, which can cause symptoms and signs of spinal stenosis. This condition can result from spondylolysis or from degenerative disk disease in the elderly.
SPONDYLOLYSIS: Defect in the pars interarticularis, either congenital or
secondary to a stress fracture, leading to lower back pain, back muscle spasms, or no
symptoms.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Low back pain is experienced by two-thirds of all adults at some point in their lives.
Approximately 2% of adults miss work each year because of low back pain. This
complaint is most common in adults in their working years, usually affecting patients
between 30 and 60 years of age. Although it is common in workers required to
perform lifting and twisting, it is also a common complaint in those who sit or stand
for prolonged periods. Low back pain is a recurrent disease that tends to be mild in
younger patients, often resolving within 2 weeks, but can be more severe and prolonged as the patient ages. It is one of the most common reasons for young adults to
seek medical care, second only to upper respiratory infections, and millions of healthcare dollars are expended on this problem each year. In evaluating patients with
low back pain, the clinician needs to exclude potentially serious conditions, such
as malignancy, infection, and dangerous neurologic processes, such as spinal cord
compression or cauda equina syndrome. Individuals without these conditions are
initially managed with conservative therapy. Nearly all patients recover spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks; only 3% to 5% remain disabled for more than 3 months. If
patients do not improve within 4 weeks with conservative management, they should
undergo further evaluation to rule out systemic or rheumatic disease and to clarify the
anatomic cause, especially patients with localized pain, nocturnal pain, or sciatica.
The potential causes of back pain are numerous (Table 24–1). Pain can emanate
from the bones, ligaments, muscles, or nerves. Rarely, it can be a result of referred
pain from a visceral organ or other structure. Back pain with radiation down the back
of the leg suggests sciatic nerve root compression, generally caused by a herniated
intervertebral disk at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 level. Patients typically report aching
pain in the buttock and paresthesias radiating into the posterior thigh and calf or
lateral foreleg. When pain radiates below the knee, it is more likely to indicate a true
radiculopathy than radiation only to the posterior thigh. A history of persistent leg
numbness or weakness further increases the likelihood of neurologic involvement.
Most cases of back pain are idiopathic, and this group, in general, is referred to
as musculoskeletal low back pain. Imaging studies and other diagnostic tests are
generally not helpful in managing these cases. Studies show that the history and
physical examination can help separate the majority of patients with simple and selflimited musculoskeletal back pain from the minority with more serious underlying
causes. Finding “red flag” symptoms can help the physician use diagnostic tests in a
more judicious manner (Table 24–2). Malignancy should be considered in patients
with systemic symptoms and who have pain at night or pain that is not relieved

by lying in a supine position. Primary cancers that commonly metastasize to the
spine include lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal (GI) tumors
and melanoma. Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm that can present with
bone pain, renal failure, and anemia. When the patient has worrisome symptoms
or signs, in most cases, the most effective initial evaluation is plain anteroposterior
and lateral radiographs of the involved area of the spine, a sedimentation rate, and
a complete blood count. More expensive tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), should be reserved for those patients for whom surgery is being considered,
because it is not required to make most diagnoses.
It is rare that the patient can recall a precipitating event. Patients often have a
history of recurrent episodes of low back pain. Psychological causes have not been
consistently related to low back pain; however, there does seem to be an association with job satisfaction. During the physical examination, palpable point tenderness over the spinous processes may indicate a destructive lesion of the spine itself;
in contrast, those with musculoskeletal back pain most often have tenderness in

the muscular paraspinal area. Strength, sensation, and reflexes should be assessed,
especially in those with complaints of radicular or radiating pain. Straight leg raise
testing, in which the examiner holds the patient’s ankle and passively elevates the
patient’s leg to 45°, is helpful if it elicits pain in the lower back suggesting nerve
root compression. However, it is not a very sensitive or specific test. The Patrick maneuver, in which the patient externally rotates the hip, flexes the knee, and
crosses the knee of the other leg with the ankle (like a number 4) while the examiner simultaneously presses down on the flexed knee and the opposite side of the
pelvis, can help distinguish pain emanating from the sacroiliac joint.
In treating idiopathic low back pain, various modalities have been shown to be
equally effective in the long run. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that
encouraging the patient to continue his or her usual activity is superior to recommendations for bed rest. Patients without disability and without evidence of nerve
root compression probably can maintain judicious activity rather than undergoing bed
rest. Bed rest probably is appropriate only for individuals with severe pain or neurologic deficits. The patient should be instructed to position himself or herself so as
to minimize pain; this usually consists of lying supine with the upper body slightly
elevated and a pillow under the knees. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications
(on a scheduled rather than on an as-needed basis), nonaspirin analgesics, and muscle
relaxants may help in the acute phase. Because most cases of disk herniation with
radiculopathy resolve spontaneously within 4 to 6 weeks without surgery, these conservative measures are initial regimen recommended for these patients as well. Narcotic
analgesics are also an option in cases of severe pain; however, because idiopathic low
back pain is often a chronic problem, their prolonged use beyond the initial phase is
discouraged. Chiropractic therapy, physical therapy, massage therapy, and acupuncture have been studied (in trials of varying quality), with results comparable to traditional approaches. Referral to a surgeon may be considered for those patients with
radicular pain with or without neuropathy that does not resolve with 4 to 6 weeks of
conservative management.
Patients with concerning clinical features, such as a history of malignancy, fever,
or examination findings suggestive of spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome, should be referred for urgent imaging, either MRI or CT of the spine, to
evaluate for conditions such as vertebral metastases, vertebral osteomyelitis, or spinal epidural abscess that require urgent treatment.

24.3 A 70-year-old woman presents with a 4-week history of low back pain, generalized weakness, and a 15-lb weight loss over the last 2 months. Her medical
history is unremarkable, and her examination is normal except that she is generally weak. Initial laboratory tests reveal an elevated sedimentation rate, mild
anemia, creatinine level 1.8 mg/dL, and calcium level 11.2 mg/dL. Which of
the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Osteoporosis with compression fractures
B. Renal failure with osteodystrophy
C. Multiple myeloma
D. Lumbar strain
E. Osteomyelitis
24.4 A 45-year-old man complains of decreased sensation in his buttocks and inability to achieve an erection. On examination he has decreased anal sphincter
tone and decreased ankle reﬂexes bilaterally. Which of the following is the
next best step in management?
A. Bed rest and follow-up in 4 to 6 weeks
B. Plain film x-ray of lumbosacral spine
C. Sedimentation rate and complete blood count
D. Immediate referral for surgical decompression

ANSWERS
24.1 A. Bed rest has not been shown to improve outcome in idiopathic low back
pain compared to encouraging usual activities that do not exacerbate the pain.
Imaging is not necessary with uncomplicated back pain.
24.2 B. The patient’s country of origin, the chronic and slowly progressive nature
of the pain in association with fever, and night sweats are highly suggestive of
tuberculous osteomyelitis of the spine, or Pott disease. Bacterial osteomyelitis
presents more acutely, often with high, spiking fevers. Metastatic breast cancer
and multiple myeloma are extremely rare in this age group. The fevers, night
sweats, and persistent and progressive nature of her back pain make a musculoskeletal cause unlikely.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

225

24.3 C. This patient has many “red ﬂag” symptoms in her presentation: her age,
new-onset pain, and history of weight loss. The elevated calcium level and
mild renal failure are classic for multiple myeloma. Plain radiographs of the
spine and, more likely, of the skull may illustrate the punched out lytic bone
lesions often seen in this disease. Bence Jones protein in the urine is also a
ﬁnding in multiple myeloma.
24.4 D. This individual has cauda equine syndrome and requires immediate surgical
decompression to avoid long-term nerve denervation and incontinence/lower
extremity weakness. The decreased anal sphincter tone and decreased ankle
reﬂexes indicate a peripheral neuropathy. Bed rest with follow-up is indicated
when no “red ﬂag” symptoms and signs are present. The plain ﬁlm x-ray is
often normal in patients with cauda equina syndrome.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Acute low back pain, even with sciatic nerve involvement, resolves within
4 to 6 weeks in 90% of patients,



Analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotics,
muscle relaxants, and attempts at maintaining some level of activity are
helpful in managing acute low back pain; bed rest does not help.



Pain that interferes with sleep, significant unintentional weight loss, or
fever suggests an infectious or neoplastic cause of back pain.



Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging, are useful only if
surgery is being considered (persistent pain and neurologic symptoms
after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative care in patients with herniated disks) or
if a neoplastic or infectious cause of back pain is being considered.



Signs for cauda equine syndrome are a clinical emergency and require
immediate referral to surgery for decompression.

ANSWERS TO CASE 25:
Iron-Deficiency Anemia
Summary: A healthy 52-year-old man complains of a 4- to 5-month history of
increasing exercise intolerance, but he denies orthopnea, PND, edema, or other
signs of heart failure. The patient uses a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) regularly. He has not had any overt gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss. On
examination, he weighs 205 lb, and he has slight pallor of the conjunctiva, skin, and
palms. He is anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL.
• Most likely diagnosis: Iron-deficiency anemia as a result of chronic blood loss.
• Next diagnostic step: Analyze the complete blood count (CBC), particularly
the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), to determine if the anemia is microcytic,
normocytic, or macrocytic; assess the leukocyte count and platelet count.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand that iron-deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia.
2. Know the diagnostic approach to anemia.
3. Be familiar with the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia.

Considerations
This 52-year-old man presents to the doctor’s office with complaints of fatigue and
dyspnea on exertion for the few months prior to the office visit. His physical examination is significant only for pallor. The serum hemoglobin level confirms anemia.
The next step would be to characterize the anemia as microcytic, which would be
consistent with iron deficiency, and confirm with further testing for total ironbinding capacity (TIBC) and ferritin. The most likely source of blood loss in male
patients is the GI tract; therefore, finding iron-deficiency anemia should suggest the
presence of a possible GI source of bleeding, with colon cancer the most serious possibility. This patient is using an NSAID, which may predispose to erosive gastritis.
Once iron-deficiency anemia is confirmed, a thorough evaluation of the GI tract,
including upper and lower endoscopy, is needed.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Iron-Deficiency Anemia
DEFINITIONS
ANEMIA: Decreased red blood cell (RBC) mass, leading to less oxygen-carrying
capacity. Hemoglobin levels less than 13 g/dL in men and less than 12 g/dL in
women are generally used.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

229

IRON STUDIES: Ferritin is a marker of iron stores, but it also is an acute-phase
reactant, which is decreased in iron deficiency but increased with inflammatory
chronic diseases. The TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin saturation levels
and is increased in iron deficiency.
MEAN CORPUSCULAR VOLUME (MCV): Average RBC volume. This offers
a method of categorizing anemias as microcytic (MCV <80 fL), normocytic (MCV
80-100 fL), and macrocytic (MCV >100 fL).
RETICULOCYTE: New RBC that usually is 1 to 1.5 days old.
RETICULOCYTE COUNT: Fraction of RBCs consisting of reticulocytes that
indirectly indicates the bone marrow activity of the erythrocyte line. It usually is
expressed as a percentage and normally is 1%; corrected reticulocyte count accounts
for anemia.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Iron Deﬁciency
Although anemia may be caused by disorders of bone marrow production, red cell
maturation, or increased destruction, iron deficiency is the most common cause of
anemia in the United States, affecting all ages and both genders. Iron is essential to
the synthesis of hemoglobin. The normal daily intake of elemental iron is approximately 15 mg, of which only 1 to 2 mg is absorbed. The daily iron losses are about
the same, but menstruation adds approximately 30 mg of iron lost each month. The
primary etiology for iron-deficiency anemia is blood loss (Table 25–1). In men, the
most frequent cause is chronic GI tract occult bleeding. In women, menstrual loss
may be the main mechanism, but other sites must be considered. Supplemental iron
is needed during pregnancy because of iron transfer from the mother to the developing fetus. Iron deficiency may also be a result of increased iron requirements, diminished iron absorption, or both. Iron deficiency can develop during the first 2 years
of life if dietary iron is inadequate for the demands of rapid growth. Adolescent girls
may become iron deficient from inadequate diet plus the added loss from menstruation. The growth spurt in adolescent boys may also produce a significant increase
in demand for iron. Other possible causes of anemia are decreased iron absorption
after gastrectomy and upper-bowel malabsorption syndrome, but such mechanisms
are rare when compared to blood loss.
When iron loss exceeds intake, iron deposits are progressively depleted.
Hemoglobin and serum iron levels may remain normal in the initial stages, but the
serum ferritin level (iron stores) will start to fall. As serum iron levels fall, the percent of transferrin saturation falls and the TIBC will increase, leading to a progressive decrease in iron available for RBC formation. At this point, anemia will
develop initially with normal-appearing RBCs. As the iron deficiency becomes more
severe, microcytosis and hypochromia will develop. Later in the disease process, iron
deficiency will affect other tissues, resulting in a variety of symptoms and signs.
Typical symptoms of anemia include fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, palpitations, and impaired concentration. Additionally, patients with chronic
severe iron deficiency may develop cravings for dirt, paint (pica), or ice (pagophagia).

Table 25–1 • COMMON CAUSES OF IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
Blood loss
Gastrointestinal blood loss
• Esophageal varices
• Peptic ulcer disease
• Gastritis, eg, NSAID induced
• Small bowel polyp or carcinoma
• Colonic angiodysplasia
• Colon cancer
• Inflammatory bowel disease, eg, ulcerative colitis
• Hookworm infestation
Uterine blood loss
• Menstruation/menorrhagia
• Uterine fibroids
Other blood loss
• Chronic hemodialysis
• Surgical blood loss
• Repeated blood donation or phlebotomy
• Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
Malabsorption
• Gastrectomy
• Celiac disease
• Inflammatory bowel disease, eg, Crohn disease
Inadequate dietary intake/increased physiologic demands
• Infancy/adolescence
• Pregnancy
• Vegetarian diet

Glossitis, cheilosis, or koilonychia may develop, and in rare cases, dysphagia associated with a postcricoid esophageal web (Plummer-Vinson syndrome) may occur.
When the anemia develops over a long period, the typical symptoms of fatigue and
shortness of breath may not be evident. Many patients with iron-deficiency anemia
may be asymptomatic. The lack of symptoms reflects the very slow development of
iron deficiency and the ability of the body to adapt to lower iron reserves and anemia.

Evaluation of Anemia Once anemia is discovered, a CBC with differential,
platelets, and RBC indices are helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.
The first step is to look at the MCV to classify the common causes of anemia
(Table 25–2). Iron deficiency usually leads to a microcytic anemia. The red blood
cell distribution width (RDW) is a calculated index that quantitates the variation
in the size of RBCs. RDW is a quantitative measure of anisocytosis (variation in cell
size) that helps to distinguish uncomplicated iron deficiencies from uncomplicated
thalassemia. An increased RDW associated with microcytic anemia is suggestive
of iron-deficiency anemia, because the bone marrow produces new erythrocytes of
various sizes. A normal RDW in the presence of microcytic anemia may be more
suggestive of chronic disease, thalassemia, or even iron deficiency with concomitant
anemia of chronic disease. A detailed history, physical examination, and further
laboratory data may be necessary to achieve a final diagnosis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

Table 25–2 • CLASSIFICATION OF ANEMIA BY MCV
Microcytic (low MCV)
• Iron deficiency
• Thalassemia
• Sideroblastic anemia
• Lead poisoning
Normocytic (normal MCV)
• Acute blood loss
• Hemolysis
• Anemia of chronic disease
• Anemia of renal failure
• Myelodysplastic syndromes
Macrocytic anemia (high MCV)
• Folate deficiency
• Vitamin B12 deficiency
• Drug toxicity, eg, zidovudine
• Alcoholism/chronic liver disease

The reticulocyte count is another important parameter to help in the differential
diagnosis of anemia. A new RBC can be stained as a reticulocyte for 24 to 36 hours,
after which the RBC circulates for approximately 120 days. The blood normally contains about 1 reticulocyte per 100 RBCs. The reticulocyte count, usually reported as
a percentage of reticulocytes per 100 RBCs, may be falsely elevated in the presence
of anemia. Therefore, a corrected reticulocyte percentage is calculated by multiplying the reported reticulocyte count by the patient’s hematocrit divided by 45 (normal hematocrit). The reticulocyte may also be converted to an absolute number by
multiplying the reported reticulocyte count by the RBC count and dividing by 100.
The absolute reticulocyte count is normally 50,000 to 70,000 reticulocytes/mm3. If
the reticulocyte count is low, causes of hypoproliferative bone marrow disorders
should be suspected. A high reticulocyte count may reflect acute blood losses,
hemolysis, or a response to therapy for anemia.
Iron studies are very helpful to confirm a diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia and
to help in the differential diagnosis with other types of anemia, such as anemia of
chronic disease and sideroblastic anemia (Table 25–3). A low serum ferritin concentration is a reliable indication of iron deficiency. Serum ferritin values are
increased with chronic inflammatory disease, malignancy, or liver injury; therefore,
serum ferritin concentration may be above normal when iron deficiency exists with
chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Hodgkin disease, or hepatitis, among
many other disorders. Measurement of serum iron concentration, serum TIBC, and
calculation of percent saturation of transferrin have been widely used for diagnosis of
iron deficiency. True iron deficiency is strongly suspected on the basis of low serum
iron level and normal or high binding capacity, which will result in a low calculated
transferrin saturation. In anemia of chronic disease, serum iron concentration is
low, but the TIBC is usually also reduced; therefore, percent transferrin saturation is typically normal. Chronic inflammatory diseases typically cause elevation
in serum ferritin concentration. When chronic disease and iron-deficiency anemia
coexist, serum ferritin concentration may be normal. Sideroblastic anemia is

a disease where the bone marrow produces abnormal RBCs, commonly microcytic and
hypochromic. The iron studies in sideroblastic anemia include increases in serum
iron and serum ferritin concentration and saturation of transferrin. An important
clue to the presence of sideroblastic anemia is the presence of stippled RBCs in the
peripheral blood smear. Iron stain in the bone marrow reveals the pathognomonic
feature of engorged mitochondria in the developing RBCs called ringed sideroblasts.
Evaluating the peripheral blood smear for specific abnormalities in RBC
morphology may be very useful for determining the etiology of anemia. In irondeficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear shows RBCs smaller than normal
(microcytes) and hypochromia.
Although the treatment of iron deficiency is straightforward, finding the underlying etiology is paramount. Treatment of iron-deficiency anemia consists of iron
replacement therapy, typically with oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg two or three times
daily. Correction of anemia usually occurs within 6 weeks, but therapy should
continue for at least 6 months to replenish the iron stores. A number of patients
may develop GI side effects, such as constipation, nausea, and abdominal cramping. Taking the iron with meals may help with tolerance but can reduce absorption. Parenteral iron therapy is indicated in rare instances, such as in patients with
a poor absorption state (occurs in celiac disease, chronic kidney disease) or with
excessive intolerance to oral therapy. Caution must be taken with parenteral iron
dextran because anaphylaxis may occur, but newer parenteral iron compounds are
now available with lower rates of adverse events.
It should be emphasized that after diagnosis of iron deficiency is established, the
cause of the iron loss should be identified. Except in menstruating women, the most
common site of blood loss is the GI tract, and most patients will require endoscopic
evaluation. Gastritis, peptic ulcers, and angiodysplasia are all common sources of
blood loss, but the most serious diagnosis to exclude would be the possibility of an
occult GI malignancy.

234

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
25.1 B. Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss leads to low ferritin levels reﬂecting
diminished iron stores, elevated TIBC, and low iron saturation. There is a
microcytic anemia (low MCV) with a low reticulocyte count. The reticulocyte
count would be elevated with acute blood loss, but the patient has not experienced this.
25.2 B. Iron deﬁciency occurs in pregnancy as a result of the expanded blood
volume and active transport of iron to the fetus.
25.3 B. Macrocytic anemia is usually a result of folate or vitamin B12 deﬁciency.
Because vitamin B12 stores last for nearly 10 years, a dietary change of several
months would more likely cause folate deﬁciency. Also vitamin B12 deﬁciency
can lead to neurologic symptoms. Folate is found in green leafy vegetables.
25.4 B. This laboratory ﬁnding is diagnostic of iron-deﬁciency anemia (microcytic,
low ferritin, high TIBC, high RDW).
25.5 D. Thalassemia usually leads to a microcytic anemia with uniform red cell size
(normal RDW) and excess iron stores.
25.6 C. Chronic disease generally leads to a normocytic anemia with elevated
ferritin level (acute-phase reactant); although a microcytic anemia can also
be seen, a normocytic anemia is more common.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Anemia is a clinical finding, not a diagnosis, and requires some investigation to determine the underlying etiology.



Iron-deficiency anemia in men or postmenopausal women is primarily a result
of gastrointestinal blood losses; therefore, finding iron-deficiency anemia in
this patient population warrants a thorough gastrointestinal workup.



Iron-deficiency anemia in women of reproductive age is most often
caused by menstrual blood loss.



Fecal occult blood testing is negative in approximately 50% of patients
with gastrointestinal cancer. Therefore, a negative fecal occult blood test
in the presence of iron-deficiency anemia should not discourage you from
pursuing a thorough gastrointestinal workup.



The mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell distribution width, and
reticulocyte index are important parameters in the evaluation of anemia.

CASE 26
A 61-year-old man comes to the emergency room complaining of 3 days of worsening abdominal pain. The pain is localized to the left lower quadrant of his abdomen.
It began as an intermittent crampy pain and now has become steady and moderately
severe. He feels nauseated, but he has not vomited. He had a small loose stool at
the beginning of this illness, but he has not had any bowel movements since. He
has never had symptoms like this before, nor any gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses.
On examination, his temperature is 100.2°F, heart rate 98 bpm, and blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg. He has no pallor or jaundice. His chest is clear, and his heart
rhythm is regular without murmurs. His abdomen is mildly distended with hypoactive bowel sounds and marked left lower quadrant tenderness with voluntary
guarding. Rectal examination reveals tenderness, and his stool is negative for
occult blood.
Laboratory studies are significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12,800/mm3
with 74% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 22% lymphocytes, and a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit. A plain film of the abdomen shows no pneumoperitoneum
and a nonspecific bowel gas pattern.

ANSWERS TO CASE 26:
Acute Sigmoid Diverticulitis
Summary: A 61-year-old man has 3 days of new-onset, worsening, left lower quadrant abdominal pain. He feels nauseated, and he has not had any bowel movements
since the illness began. He has a low-grade fever and is hemodynamically stable.
He has no pallor or jaundice, and his abdomen is mildly distended with hypoactive
bowel sounds and marked left lower quadrant tenderness with voluntary guarding.
He has leukocytosis and normal hemoglobin with no occult blood in his stool. A
plain film of the abdomen shows no acute changes.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute sigmoid diverticulitis.
• Most appropriate next step: Admit to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics
and monitoring. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen will be
very useful to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude pericolic abscess or other
complications, such as fistula formation.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the complications of diverticular disease.
2. Understand the appropriate therapy of acute diverticulitis, which is dependent
on the age of the patient and the severity of the disease presentation.
3. Learn the complications of diverticulitis and the indications for surgical
intervention.

Considerations
This is an older patient with new-onset, progressively severe, lower abdominal pain
on the left side, suggesting diverticulitis as a diagnosis. The low-grade temperature
and leukocytosis are consistent with acute sigmoid diverticulitis, which is likely to
improve with antibiotic therapy. The abdominal film reveals no pneumoperitoneum,
making perforation less likely. Diverticulosis, that is, non-inflammatory diverticuli,
may present with bright red bleeding per rectum. Ischemic colitis is another diagnostic consideration in an older patient, but it usually is associated with signs of bleeding, whereas diverticulitis is not. Because the clinical presentation may be similar, it
is important to evaluate the patient for colon cancer with perforation, once all signs
of inflammation have subsided.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

239

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Diverticulitis
DEFINITIONS
COLONIC DIVERTICULUM: Herniation of the mucosa and submucosa through
a weakness of the muscle lining of the colon.
DIVERTICULITIS: Inflammation of a colonic diverticulum, typically on the left
colon, such as the sigmoid.
DIVERTICULOSIS: Presence of diverticular disease in the colon without inflammation, and is often asymptomatic or may present with painless bright red rectal
bleeding.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Diverticulosis is extremely common, affecting 50% to 80% of people older than
80 years. Colonic diverticula are, in fact, pseudodiverticula through a weakness in
the muscle lining, typically at areas of vascular penetration to the smooth muscle.
Therefore, their walls do not contain the muscle layers surrounding the colon.
They are typically 5 to 10 mm in diameter and occur mainly in the distal colon
in Western societies. The development of diverticula has been linked to insufficient dietary fiber leading to alteration in colonic transit time and increased resting
colonic intraluminal pressure. The majority of patients will remain asymptomatic.
However, some patients will have chronic symptoms resembling those of irritable
bowel syndrome (nonspecific lower abdominal pain aggravated by eating with relief
upon defecation, bloating, and constipation or diarrhea). They may even present
with acute symptoms that could be confused with acute diverticulitis, but without
evidence of inflammation upon further workup. This entity has been named “painful
diverticular disease without diverticulitis.” Complications of diverticulosis include
acute diverticulitis, hemorrhage, and obstruction.
Diverticular hemorrhage is the most common cause of hematochezia in patients
older than 60 years, and typically presents as painless passage of bright red blood.
Only 20% of patients with diverticulosis will experience GI bleeding. Generally,
the hemorrhage is abrupt in onset and abrupt in resolution. The diagnosis may
be established by finding diverticula on endoscopy without other pathology. Most
diverticular hemorrhages are self-limited, and treatment is supportive, with intravenous fluid or blood replacement as needed. Treatment of diverticulosis consists of
dietary measures with increased fiber. Avoidance of nuts or foods with small seeds
(eg, strawberries) is traditionally advised, although data supporting this recommendation are scant. For patients with recurrent or chronic bleeding, resection of the
affected colonic segment may be indicated.
Acute diverticulitis is another common complication of diverticulosis, developing in approximately 20% of all patients with diverticula. Patients often present
with acute abdominal pain and signs of peritoneal irritation localizing to the left
lower quadrant, often presenting like “left-sided appendicitis.” Inspissated stool

particles (fecaliths) appear to obstruct the diverticular neck, setting up for more
inflammation and diminished venous outflow, as well as bacterial overgrowth, which
ultimately leads to abrasion and perforation of the thin diverticular wall. Most cases
are uncomplicated and may be managed medically, but 25% of cases develop complications that may require surgical intervention (Table 26–1).

Diagnosis
Patients usually present with visceral pain that localizes later to the left lower quadrant and is associated with fever, nausea, vomiting, or constipation. A right lower
quadrant presentation would not exclude this diagnosis because ascending colon or
cecal diverticulitis can occur. On examination, the patient may have localized left
lower quadrant tenderness or more diffuse abdominal tenderness with peritoneal
irritation signs, such as guarding or rebound tenderness.
Plain film radiographs, including abdominal erect and supine films with a chest
x-ray, are routinely performed but usually are not diagnostic. They help in identifying patients with pneumoperitoneum and assessing their cardiopulmonary status,
especially in patients with other comorbid conditions. Barium enemas are contraindicated for fear of perforation and spillage of contrast into the abdominal cavity, a
catastrophic complication. Endoscopy is also relatively contraindicated in the acute
phase and usually is reserved for use at least 6 weeks after resolution of the attack and
then is performed primarily to exclude colonic neoplasia, which may have similar
findings on imaging.
CT scan typically is the preferred modality of choice for diagnosing diverticulitis.
Findings consistent with diverticulitis include sigmoid diverticula, thickening of the
bowel wall to more than 4 mm, pericolic fat stranding signifying inflammation, or
the finding of a diverticular abscess.

Therapy
Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can usually be managed conservatively
(with bowel rest and antibiotics). Selected patients may be managed as outpatients
(less severe presentation, ability to tolerate oral intake, no significant comorbid
conditions). Oral antibiotics may include a quinolone plus metronidazole, or
amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 to 14 days. Patients should be instructed to take clear
liquids only, and advance their diet slowly only if clinical improvement is evident
after 2 to 3 days.
Factors that advocate for inpatient therapy include elderly or immunosuppressed patients, those with significant comorbidities, and those with high fever

or significant leukocytosis, or the need for narcotics to control pain. Patients
requiring hospitalization can be treated with clear liquids or NPO with intravenous hydration, depending upon the severity of symptoms. Intravenous empiric
antibiotics with broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative rods and anaerobic
organisms (eg, piperacillin/tazobactam, or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole) should
be started. Pain, fever, and leukocytosis are expected to diminish with appropriate management in the first few days of treatment, at which point the dietary
intake can be advanced gradually. CT imaging is indicated to identify complications (Table 26–2) such as abscess, stricture, or obstruction in the patient with
persistent fever or pain.
Surgical management such as sigmoid resection is indicated for low surgical risk
patients with complicated diverticulitis. Patients who have suffered two or more
episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis are often treated surgically, but medical
management may also be continued without increased risk of perforation. Indications for emergent surgical intervention include generalized peritonitis, uncontrolled sepsis, perforation, and clinical deterioration.

extremely rare.

Single-stage surgery with fistula
closure and primary anastomosis.

Obstruction

Either acutely or chronically. Ileus or
pseudo-obstruction is more likely
than complete mechanical obstruction. Small bowel obstruction may
occur if a small bowel loop was
incorporated in the inflamed mass.

Usually amenable to medical
management (NPO, gastric
decompression). If not, prompt
surgical intervention is required.

Strictures

Occur as a result of recurrent
attacks of diverticulitis. Insidiousonset colonic obstruction is likely.
Colonoscopy is important for an
accurate diagnosis and to exclude a
stenosing neoplasm as the cause of
the stricture.

A trial of endoscopic therapy
(bougienage, balloon, laser,
electrocautery, or a blunt dilating
endoscope) reasonably can be
attempted. Surgery is indicated if
neoplasm could not be excluded
or if such trial has failed.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
26.1 A 48-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with left lower quadrant
abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and a CT showing sigmoid wall thickening consistent with a pericolic abscess. Her only signiﬁcant medical history is a similar
hospitalization with the same diagnosis less than a year previously. Which of
the following is the most appropriate treatment?
A. Surgical consultation for exploratory laparotomy and sigmoid resection
B. Intravenous antibiotics with follow-up colonoscopy after hospital discharge
C. Intravenous antibiotics and barium enema to evaluate for possible colonic
malignancy
D. Intravenous antibiotics and recommendations for post-discharge diet
high in fiber with whole grains and nuts to minimize the risk of diverticular progression
26.2 A 78-year-old is noted to have fever and chills, decreased mentation, tachycardia,
and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness and guarding. Which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Ruptured diverticulitis
B. Meningitis
C. Ruptured appendicitis
D. Ischemic bowel
E. Urosepsis
26.3 A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a temperature of
102°F, abdominal pain localizing to the left lower quadrant, and mild rebound
tenderness. Which of the following diagnostic tests is the best next step?
A. Barium enema
B. Flexible sigmoidoscopy
C. CT imaging of the abdomen
D. Laparoscopic examination

ANSWERS
26.1 A. This patient has complicated diverticulitis, with recurrent disease, and is
a low surgical risk, and thus should be evaluated for resection. Barium enema
is contraindicated due to risk of perforation, and dietary recommendations
regarding nuts and seeds are unsupported by data.
26.2 C. The most common cause of an acute abdomen at any age is appendicitis.
26.3 C. CT imaging is the modality of choice in evaluating diverticulitis. Barium
enema and endoscopy tend to increase intraluminal pressure and can worsen
diverticulitis or lead to colonic rupture.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Acute diverticulitis usually presents with left lower quadrant pain,
fever, leukocytosis, and constipation, and often with signs of peritoneal
inflammation.



Uncomplicated diverticulitis can be treated medically with antibiotics and
bowel rest. Complicated diverticulitis is usually treated surgically.



Diverticulitis can be complicated by perforation with peritonitis, pericolic
abscess, fistula formation, often to the bladder, and strictures with colonic
obstruction.



Enemas and endoscopy are usually avoided in acute diverticulitis because
of the risk of perforation.

CASE 27
A 24-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of 24 hours of
fevers with shaking chills. He is currently being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). His most recent chemotherapy with hyperfractionated CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) was 7 days ago. He
denies any cough or dyspnea, headache, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. He has had
no sick contacts or recent travel. On physical examination, he is febrile to 103°F,
tachycardic with heart rate 122 bpm, blood pressure 118/65 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. He is ill appearing; his skin is warm and moist but
without any rashes. He has no oral lesions, his chest is clear to auscultation, his
heart rate is tachycardic but regular with a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal
border, and his abdominal examination is benign. The perirectal area is normal,
and digital rectal examination is deferred, but his stool is negative for occult blood.
He has a tunneled vascular catheter at the right internal jugular vein without erythema overlying the subcutaneous tract and no purulent discharge at the catheter
exit site. Of note, he reports an onset of shaking chills 30 minutes after the catheter
was flushed. Laboratory studies reveal a total white blood cell count of 1100 cells/
mm3, with a differential of 10% neutrophils, 16% band forms, 70% lymphocytes,
and 4% monocytes (absolute neutrophil count 286/mm3). Chest radiograph
and urinalysis are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 27:
Neutropenic Fever, Vascular Catheter Infection
Summary: A 24-year-old man with ALL is receiving immunosuppressive
chemotherapy. He now presents with fever. He has no respiratory or abdominal
symptoms, a clear chest x-ray, and an absolute neutrophil count of 286/mm3. He has
a central venous catheter, with a history suggestive of possible catheter infection.
• Most likely diagnosis: Neutropenic fever and possible infected vascular
catheter.
• Next therapeutic step: After drawing blood cultures, the patient should undergo
broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic administration, including coverage for
gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus spp. The vascular catheter should
be removed, if possible.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the possible sources of infection in a neutropenic patient.
2. Learn the management of a patient with neutropenic fever.
3. Be able to diagnose and treat a catheter-related infection.
4. Understand the techniques to prevent infection in immunosuppressed patients,
including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and vaccination of
household contacts.

Considerations
This patient is being treated for a hematologic malignancy with combination
chemotherapy, which has a common side effect of leukopenia and, especially,
neutropenia. Generally, the nadir of the white cell count occurs 7 to 14 days after
the chemotherapy. This patient certainly has neutropenia, defined as an absolute
neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm3. The absolute neutrophil count is calculated by neutrophil percent multiplied by total WBC count. Infection in this
immunosuppressed condition is life-threatening, and immediate antibiotic coverage
is paramount. Neutropenic patients are at risk for a variety of bacterial, fungal, or
viral infections, but the most common sources of infection are gram-positive bacteria from the skin or oral cavity or gram-negative bacteria from the bowel. Infection
of the indwelling catheter, as in this individual, is common. Rapid institution of
empiric antibiotic therapy is critical while attempts to find a source of infection are
in progress.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

247

APPROACH TO:
Neutropenic Fever
DEFINITIONS
CVC: Central venous catheter.
FEVER: Single oral temperature measurement more than or equal to 101°F (38.3°C)
or a temperature more than or equal to 100.4°F (38.0°C) for 1 hour or more.
MUCOSITIS: Breakdown of skin and mucosal barriers as a result of chemotherapy
or radiation. Mucositis can result in bacteremia or fungemia.
NEUTROPENIA: Absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm3 or a count
less than 1000 cells/mm3 with a predicted decrease to less than 500 cells/mm3.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Fever in a neutropenic patient with cancer should be considered a medical
emergency. Approximately 5% to 10% of cancer patients will die of neutropeniaassociated infection. Individuals with a hematologic malignancy (leukemias or
lymphomas) are at even greater risk for sepsis as a result of lymphocyte or granulocyte
dysfunction or because of abnormal immunoglobulin production. Chemotherapy
often causes further bone marrow suppression and neutropenia. The incidence of
an occult infection in a neutropenic patient increases with the severity and duration of the neutropenia (>7-10 days). Some neutropenic patients (eg, the elderly
or those receiving corticosteroids) may not be able to mount a febrile response to
infection; thus, any neutropenic patient showing signs of clinical deterioration
should be suspected of having sepsis.
The typical signs and symptoms of infection noted in immunocompetent patients
are the result of the host’s inflammatory response and may be minimal or absent in
neutropenic patients. Soft tissue infections may have diminished or absent induration, erythema, or purulence; pneumonia may not show a discernible infiltrate on a
chest radiograph; meningitis may not reveal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis;
and urinary tract infection may be present without pyuria.
Empiric antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly to all neutropenic
patients at the onset of fever. Historically, gram-negative bacilli, mainly enteric
flora, were the most common pathogens in these patients. Because of their frequency
and because of the high rate of mortality associated with gram-negative septicemia,
empiric coverage for gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is
almost always indicated for neutropenic fever. Currently, as a consequence of frequent use of central venous catheters (CVCs), gram-positive bacteria now account
for 60% to 70% of microbiologically documented infections. Other clues that the
infection is likely to be a gram-positive organism include the presence of obvious
soft tissue infection, such as cellulitis or oral mucositis, which causes breaks in the
mucosal barriers and allows oral flora to enter the bloodstream. If any of these factors are present, an appropriate agent, such as vancomycin, should be added to the
regimen. If patients continue to be febrile despite antibacterial therapy, empiric

antifungal therapy with either fluconazole or amphotericin B should be considered.
Figure 27–1 shows a useful algorithm for patient management.
Central venous catheters are in widespread use and are a common site of infection
in hospitalized patients and in those receiving outpatient infusion therapy. Infection may occur as a consequence of contamination by gram-positive skin flora or by
hematogenous seeding, usually by enteric gram-negative organisms or Candida spp.
Erythema, purulent drainage, and induration are evidence of infection. A variety
of CVCs are frequently used, with different rates of infection.
The two main decisions impacting suspected catheter-related infection are
(1) whether the catheter is really the source of infection and, if it is, (2) must the
catheter be removed or can the infection be cleared with antibiotic therapy? Most
nontunneled or implanted catheters should be removed. For the more permanent
catheters, the decision to remove the catheter depends on the patient’s clinical
state, identification of the organism, and the presence of complications such as
endocarditis or septic venous thrombosis. Infected catheters may produce several
manifestations, such as infections of the subcutaneous tunnel, infection at the exit
site, or catheter-related bacteremia and sepsis. Generally, erythema overlying the
subcutaneous tract of a tunneled catheter necessitates catheter removal. Leaving
the catheter in place may result in severe cellulitis and soft tissue necrosis. If there is
only erythema at the exit site, it may be possible to salvage the line using antibiotics,
usually vancomycin, through the CVC. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as
Staphylococcus epidermidis, are the most common organisms causing line infections.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

249

In the absence of obvious tunnel or exit-site infection, authorities recommend
obtaining two or more blood cultures to try to diagnose catheter-related bacteremia.
Catheter-related infection is suspected when a patient has two or more positive
blood cultures obtained from a peripheral vein, clinical manifestation of infection
(eg, fever, chills, and/or hypotension), and no apparent source for bloodstream infection except for the catheter. In some institutions, quantitative blood cultures are
obtained, that is, counting colony-forming units (CFUs), with the idea that heavier
colony counts will be obtained from blood drawn through an infected catheter than
from blood obtained from a peripheral vein. If the catheter is removed, the tip of the
catheter may be cut off and rolled across a culture plate, again using a quantitative
culture method.
Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus are the most
common causes of catheter-associated infections. With coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus bacteremia, response to antibiotic therapy without catheter
removal is possible up to 80% of the time; that is, one may seek to “sterilize” the
CVC if it is deemed necessary. However, this is usually not advisable in critically ill or
hemodynamically unstable patients in whom immediate catheter removal and rapid
administration of antibiotics are essential. Bacteremia as a consequence of S aureus,
gram-negative organisms, and fungemia caused by Candida spp respond poorly to
antimicrobial therapy alone, so prompt removal of the catheter is recommended.
Because of the serious complications associated with neutropenia, preventive
measures are critical in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy. They should
be immunized against Pneumococcus and influenza, but administration of live
virus vaccines, such as measles-mumps-rubella or varicella zoster, is contraindicated.
G-CSF, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce neutrophils, is frequently
used prophylactically in patients receiving chemotherapy to shorten the duration
and depth of neutropenia, thereby reducing the risk of infection. It is sometimes used
once a neutropenic patient develops a fever, but its use at that point is controversial.
Prophylactic use of oral quinolones to prevent gram-negative infection or antifungal agents to prevent Candida infection may reduce certain types of infection but
may select for resistant organisms and is not routinely used. In hospitalized patients
with neutropenia, use of reverse isolation offers no benefit (the patient is most often
infected with his or her own flora) and interferes with patient care.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
27.1 Which of the following infectious agents is the most likely etiology associated

of the following is appropriate therapy?
A. Immunization against varicella
B. Immunization against mumps
C. Use of recombinant erythropoietin before the next cycle of chemotherapy
D. Use of G-CSF after the next cycle of chemotherapy

ANSWERS
27.1 C. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as S epidermidis, along with S aureus,
are the most common etiology of catheter-related infections.
27.2 E. Antifungal therapy should be added when the fever is persistent despite
broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.
27.3 D. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor given after chemotherapy can
decrease the duration and severity of neutropenia and the subsequent risk
of sepsis. Live vaccines, such as varicella and mumps, are contraindicated.
Erythropoietin is not indicated because the patient is not anemic.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

251

CLINICAL PEARLS


Fever in a neutropenic patient should be considered a medical emergency
and is associated with a high mortality rate.



The usual sources of bacterial infection in neutropenic patients are
gram-positive skin or oral flora or gram-negative enteric flora, including
Pseudomonas.



Antifungal therapy should be started in neutropenic patients who have
persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and who have
no obvious source of infection.



Vascular catheters with evidence of infection along a subcutaneous tract
or purulent discharge at the exit site should be removed; replacement
over a guidewire is insufficient.



If a catheter is deemed necessary but it is infected with coagulase-negative
staphylococci, antibiotic treatment may sterilize the catheter, allowing it
to remain in place. For S aureus, gram-negative rods, or fungal catheter
infections, the catheter usually requires removal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 28:
Sickle Cell Crisis
Summary: A 25-year-old African American man with a history of numerous pain
crises is admitted for abdominal and bilateral lower extremity pain. He is febrile
to 101°F, with respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and slight tachycardia of 100
bpm. Lung examination reveals bronchial breath sounds and egophony in the right
lung base. His oxygen saturation on 2 L/min nasal cannula is 92%. He is now complaining of chest pain, which is worse on inspiration. He has a leukocytosis, an elevated reticulocyte count, and a hemoglobin and hematocrit that are slightly lower
than baseline. Sickle and target cells are seen on the peripheral smear.
• Most likely diagnosis: Acute chest syndrome
• Next step: Chest radiograph and empiric antibiotic therapy
• Potential complications: Respiratory failure, possible death

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia and acute painful episodes.
2. Learn the acute and chronic complications of sickle cell anemia.
3. Become familiar with treatment options available for the complications of sickle
cell anemia.

Considerations
The patient in this case, a 25-year-old man with known sickle cell disease with
a history of numerous pain crises is admitted with abdominal pain and bilateral
leg pain. He also has the acute onset of chest pain, cough, fever, and abnormal
findings on the pulmonary auscultation. His oxygen saturation is 92% on room
air, which is concerning, and should be followed up with an arterial blood gas.
Pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and acute chest syndrome should be considered
as possible diagnoses. Acute chest syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that
includes chest pain and tachypnea. It can result from infectious or noninfectious
(eg, pulmonary infarct) causes. It usually presents with some combination of chest
pain, fever, hypoxia, and a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography. Often,
acute chest syndrome and pneumonia cannot be distinguished initially. Therefore,
it is prudent to treat these patients with antibiotics, obtain a Gram stain and culture of the sputum, and admit them to the hospital. The treatment for acute chest
syndrome is supportive and includes oxygen, intravenous fluid hydration, and analgesia. These patients should be carefully evaluated, because significant morbidity or
mortality can result.

APPROACH TO:
Sickle Cell Anemia
DEFINITIONS
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA: A congenital defect in hemoglobin formation such that
both genes code for hemoglobin S, leading to hemolysis and an abnormal shape
of the red blood cell. Affected individuals have numerous complications including
pain crises.
ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME: A condition found in individuals with sickle
cell disease characterized by fever, tachycardia, chest pain, leukocytosis, and
pulmonary infiltrates.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology
The molecular structure of a normal hemoglobin molecule consists of two alphaglobin chains and two beta-globin chains. Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a substitution of valine for glutamine in the sixth amino
acid position of the beta-globin chain. This substitution results in an alteration of
the quaternary structure of the hemoglobin molecule. Individuals in whom only half
of their beta chains are affected are heterozygous, a state referred to as sickle cell trait.
When both beta chains are affected, the patient is homozygous and has sickle cell
anemia. In patients with sickle cell disease, the altered quaternary structure of the
hemoglobin molecule causes polymerization of the molecules under conditions of
deoxygenation. These rigid polymers distort the red blood cell into a sickle shape,
which is characteristic of the disease. Sickling is promoted by hypoxia, acidosis,
dehydration, or variations in body temperature.

Epidemiology
Sickle cell anemia is the most common autosomal recessive disorder and the most
common cause of hemolytic anemia in African Americans. Approximately 8% of
African Americans carry the gene (ie, sickle cell trait), with one in 625 affected by
the disease.

Complications of Sickle Cell Disease
Acute painful episodes, also known as pain crises, are a consequence of microvascular
occlusion of bones by sickled cells. The most common sites are the long bones of
the arms and legs, the vertebral column, and the sternum. Acute painful episodes
are precipitated by infection, hypoxia (for instance, at high altitude), cold exposure,
dehydration, venous stasis, or acidosis. They usually last 2 to 7 days.
Infections are another complication. Patients with sickle cell disease are at greater
risk for infections, especially with encapsulated bacterial organisms. Autoinfarction
of the spleen occurs during early childhood secondary to microvascular obstruction
by sickled red blood cells. The spleen gradually regresses in size and by age 4 years

256

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

is no longer palpable. As a consequence of infarction and fibrosis, the immunologic capacity of the spleen is diminished. Patients with sickle cell disease are at
greater risk for pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis by encapsulated organisms such
as Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae. For the same reason, patients
with sickle cell disease are at greater risk for osteomyelitis with Salmonella spp.
Acute chest syndrome is a vaso-occlusive crisis within the lungs and is associated with infection or pulmonary infarction. It is characterized by the presence of
the following signs and symptoms: new pulmonary infiltrate, chest pain, fever, and
respiratory symptoms such as tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. These episodes may
be precipitated by pneumonia causing sickling in the infected lung segments, or, in
the absence of infection, intrapulmonary sickling can occur as a primary event. It
is virtually impossible to clinically distinguish whether or not infection is present;
thus, empiric antibiotic therapy is used.
Aplastic crisis occurs secondary to viral suppression of red blood cell precursors,
most often by parvovirus B19. It occurs because of the very short half-life of sickled
red blood cells and consequent need for brisk erythropoiesis. If red blood cell production is inhibited, even for a short time, profound anemia may result. The process
is acute and usually reversible, with spontaneous recovery.
Other complications of sickle cell disease include hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke
as a result of thrombosis, pigmented gallstones, papillary necrosis of the kidney,
priapism, and congestive heart failure.

Treatment
The mainstay of treatment of pain crisis is hydration and pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and narcotics. It is important to also provide adequate oxygenation to reduce sickling. One must search diligently for any underlying
infection, and antibiotics are often used empirically when infection is suspected.
Acute chest syndrome is treated with oxygen, analgesia, and antibiotics. Sometimes exchange transfusions are necessary. In general, blood transfusions may be
required for aplastic crisis, for severe hypoxia in acute chest syndrome, or to decrease
viscosity and cerebral thrombosis in patients with stroke. Transfusion does not shorten
the duration of pain crisis. To protect against encapsulated organisms, all patients
with sickle cell disease should receive penicillin prophylaxis and a vaccination
against pneumococcus. Hydroxyurea is often used to reduce the occurrence of
painful crisis by stimulating hemoglobin F production and thus decreasing hemoglobin S concentration, and should be considered in patients who have repeated
episodes of acute chest syndrome or frequent severe pain crises. The antineoplastic
agent 5-deoxyazacytidine (decitabine) may also elevate levels of hemoglobin
F without excessive side effects.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Treatment of an acute painful episode in sickle cell disease includes
hydration, narcotic analgesia, adequate oxygenation, and search for underlying infection.



Acute chest syndrome is characterized by chest pain, fever, new radiographic
pulmonary infiltrate, and respiratory symptoms; it can be caused by
pneumonia, vaso-occlusion, or pulmonary embolism.



Blood transfusion may be required for aplastic crisis, for severe hypoxemia in acute chest syndrome, or to decrease viscosity and cerebral
thrombosis in patients with stroke.



Hydroxyurea and decitabine increase hemoglobin F production (decreasing hemoglobin S concentration) and thus reduce the frequency of pain
crises and other complications.

CASE 29
A 20-year-old college student is your next patient in the emergency room. When
you walk into the room, he is lying on the examination table, on his side, with
his arm covering his eyes. The light in the room is off. You look at his chart and
see that the nurse recorded his temperature as 102.3°F, heart rate 110 bpm, and
blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. When you gently ask how he has been feeling,
he says that for the past 3 days he has had fever, body aches, and a progressively
worsening headache. The light hurts his eyes and he is nauseated, but he has not
vomited. He has had some rhinorrhea, but no diarrhea, cough, or nasal congestion. He has no known ill contacts. On examination, he has no skin rash, but his
pupils are difficult to assess because of photophobia. Ears and oropharynx are
normal. Heart, lung, and abdomen examinations are normal. Neurologic examination reveals no focal neurologic deficits, but passive flexion of his neck worsens
his headache, and he is unable to touch his chin to his chest.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS TO CASE 29:
Bacterial Meningitis
Summary: A 20-year-old college student presents with a 3-day history of fever,
headache, myalgias, and nausea. He has no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms,
but now has developed photophobia. He is febrile to 102.3°F, tachycardic, and
normotensive. His physical examination is generally unremarkable with a nonfocal
neurologic examination but some neck stiffness, suggesting meningeal irritation. He
has no skin lesions as might be seen in meningococcemia.
• Most likely condition: Meningitis
• Diagnostic test to confirm diagnosis: Lumbar puncture (LP) for evaluation of
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), possibly preceded by a computed tomographic
(CT) scan of the head

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the clinical presentations of viral and bacterial meningitis.
2. Know that LP is the diagnostic test of choice for meningitis.
3. Be familiar with the treatment for meningitis.

Considerations
This 20-year-old college student has headache, nausea, photophobia, fever, and
neck pain and stiffness—all suggestive of meningitis, which could be bacterial or
viral. Prompt LP and analysis of CSF are essential to establish the diagnosis. In a
patient without focal neurologic signs and a normal level of consciousness, CT scan
may be unnecessary prior to performing an LP. If he had a purpuric skin rash, one
would be suspicious of Neisseria meningitis, and appropriate antibiotics should be
administered immediately. Dosing of antibiotics in suspected meningococcal infection should not await the performance of any diagnostic test because progression
of the disease is rapid, and mortality and morbidity are extremely high even when
antibiotics are given in a timely manner.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Meningitis
DEFINITIONS
MENINGITIS: Inflammation of the subarachnoid space and meninges, most often
infectious, can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa.
PAPILLEDEMA: Swelling of the optic nerve, caused by an increased intracranial
pressure. On funduscopic examination, the optic disc margin appears hazy.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

261

ENCEPHALITIS: Brain parenchymal injury and inflammation most often due to
a virus. When focal brain parenchymal infection is caused by bacteria, it is usually
termed cerebritis or abscess.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Bacterial meningitis is the most common pus-forming intracranial infection, with
an incidence of 2.5 per 10 000 persons. The microbiology of the disease has changed
somewhat since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine in
the 1980s. Now Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial isolate,
with Neisseria meningitidis a close second. Group B Streptococcus or S agalactiae
occurs in approximately 10% of cases, more frequently in neonates or in patients
older than 50 years or with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or liver disease. Listeria
monocytogenes accounts for approximately 10% of cases and must be considered
in pregnant women, the elderly, or patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity such as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) patients. H influenzae is
responsible for less than 10% of meningitis cases. Resistance to penicillin and some
cephalosporins is now of great concern in the treatment of S pneumoniae.
Bacteria usually seed the meninges hematogenously after colonizing and invading the nasal or oropharyngeal mucosa. Occasionally, bacteria directly invade the
intracranial space from a site of abscess formation in the middle ear or sinuses. The
gravity and rapidity of progression of disease depend upon both host defense and
organism virulence characteristics. For example, patients with defects in the complement cascade are more susceptible to invasive meningococcal disease. Patients
with CSF rhinorrhea caused by trauma or postsurgical changes may also be more
susceptible to bacterial invasion.
Staphylococcus aureus and S epidermidis are common causes of meningitis in
patients following neurologic procedures such as placement of ventriculoperitoneal
shunts. The brisk host inflammatory response in the subarachnoid space may cause
edema, vasculitis, and coagulation of vessels, leading to severe neurologic complications including seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and stroke. Acute bacterial
meningitis can progress over hours to days. Typical symptoms include fever, neck
stiffness, and headache. Patients may also complain of photophobia, nausea and
vomiting, and more nonspecific constitutional symptoms. Approximately 75% of
patients will experience some confusion or altered level of consciousness. Forty percent
may experience seizures during the course of their illness.
Some physical examination findings may be useful in the evaluation of a patient
with suspected meningitis. Nuchal rigidity is demonstrated when passive or active
flexion of the neck results in an inability to touch the chin to the chest. Classic tests
include Kernig and Brudzinski signs. Kernig sign can be elicited with the patient on
his or her back. The hip and knees are flexed. The knee is then passively extended,
and the test is positive if this maneuver elicits pain. Brudzinski sign is positive if the
supine patient flexes the knees and hips when the neck is passively flexed. Neither
sign is very sensitive for the presence of meningeal irritation, but, if present, both
are highly specific. Papilledema, if present, would indicate increased intracranial
pressure, and focal neurologic signs or altered level of consciousness or seizures may
reflect ischemia of the cerebral vasculature or focal suppuration.

262

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is fairly limited and can be narrowed depending upon the patient’s age, as discussed earlier, exposure history, and
course of illness. Various viral infections may also cause meningitis. These include
enteroviruses, which tend to be more common in the summer and fall, when patients
may present with severe headache, accompanied by symptoms of gastroenteritis.
The CSF white blood cell (WBC) count will be elevated, with a predominance
of lymphocytes, and usually glucose and protein levels are normal (Table 29–1).
Either herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 or HSV-2 can cause herpes simplex meningitis.
The CSF of these patients will also have a normal glucose level, whereas protein
and WBC counts will be elevated with a predominance of lymphocytes. Typically,
these patients have a high CSF red blood cell count, which is not seen in bacterial
meningitis in the absence of a traumatic spinal tap. In a patient with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, fungal meningitis, specifically caused by
Cryptococcus, should be considered. Tuberculous meningitis presents subacutely and
is more common in older, debilitated patients, or in patients with HIV. Rickettsial
disease, specifically Rocky Mountain spotted fever, may also present with meningitis.
Intracranial empyema, or brain or epidural abscess, should be considered, especially
if the patient has focal neurologic findings. The one nonsuppurative diagnosis in the
differential is subarachnoid hemorrhage. These patients present with sudden onset
of the “worst headache of their lives” in the absence of other symptoms of infection.
They may have photophobia, and the CSF will be grossly bloody; the supernatant
will be xanthochromic, reflecting the breakdown of blood into bilirubin.
Blood cultures should be obtained in all patients with suspected meningitis. Critical
to the diagnosis of meningitis is the LP and evaluation of the CSF. Table 29–1 lists
typical findings in the CSF from various causes of meningitis.
The necessity of imaging of the head and brain prior to performing an LP is
controversial. Studies show that in the patient with suspected meningitis who does
not have papilledema, focal neurologic signs, or altered level of consciousness, an
LP may be safely performed without preceding imaging. However, in instances in
which performance of the LP may be delayed, antibiotics should be administered
after blood cultures while awaiting the radiologic studies. Ideally, the CSF should
be examined within 30 minutes of antibiotics, but it has been shown that if the LP
is performed within 2 hours of antibiotic administration, it will not significantly
alter the CSF protein, glucose, or WBC count, or Gram stain. If CSF is obtained,
a culture and Gram stain should be sent. If enough fluid is available, it should also
be sent for cell count and glucose and protein levels. Latex agglutination tests for
S pneumoniae and H influenzae can be useful in patients pretreated with antibiotics,
and, although not very sensitive, they are highly specific. If positive they can establish the infectious agent. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is available for
some bacteria; however, it may be more useful in the diagnosis of herpes simplex,
enteroviral, or tuberculous meningitis. In all, no more than 3.5 to 4 mL of CSF is
necessary. The most critical issue in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis,
however, is the initiation of antibiotics. The CSF examination and imaging studies
can be deferred in this medical emergency.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

During the course of treatment, most patients will undergo some cerebral imaging
studies. Computed tomographic (CT) scans are most useful in the initial presentation
to exclude intracranial mass or bleeding, or to evaluate for other signs of increased
intracranial pressure. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most helpful
for demonstrating any focal ischemia or infarction caused by the disease. When HSV
meningitis is suspected, MRI should demonstrate enhancement of the temporal
lobes. In tuberculous meningitis, enhancement of the basal region may be seen. An
electroencephalogram (EEG) may be helpful in patients suspected of HSV meningitis.
Within 2 to 15 days of the start of the illness, periodic sharp and slow wave complexes originating within the temporal lobes can be demonstrated at 2- to 3-second
intervals. When the purpuric skin lesions are present, skin biopsy may demonstrate
N meningitidis and can be helpful in the diagnosis. Age may give a clue regarding
etiology of meningitis (Table 29–2).

Therapy
Treatment of meningitis often is empiric until specific culture data are available.
Because of the growing incidence of resistant pneumococci as well as meningococci,
the recommended empiric therapy in most areas is a high-dose third-generation
cephalosporin given concurrently with vancomycin. In other areas, if the disease
presentation is typical for meningococcus (with the typical rash) or the organism is
identified quickly on Gram stain of the CSF, therapy with high-dose penicillin can
be started if the meningococcus in that area is known to be sensitive. Ampicillin
is added when there is a suspicion of listeriosis. Acyclovir should be started for
suspicion of HSV, or four-drug antituberculosis (TB) therapy should be started if the

presentation is suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The administration of glucocorticoids to reduce CNS (central nervous system) inflammation is controversial.
One study in adults demonstrated decreased mortality in patients with S pneumoniae
meningitis who were given glucocorticoids. There are stronger data supporting
steroids for H influenzae and S pneumoniae meningitis in children. There is also some
evidence for benefit of steroids in severe tuberculous meningitis.
Prevention of meningitis can be achieved through the administration of vaccines
and chemoprophylaxis of close contacts. Specific vaccinations are available for
H influenzae type B and some strains of S pneumoniae and are now routinely
administered to children. Meningococcal vaccination is recommended for those
living in dormitory situations, such as college students and military recruits, but not
for the general population. Rifampin given twice daily for 2 days or a single dose of
ciprofloxacin is recommended for household and close contacts of an index case of
meningococcemia or meningococcal meningitis.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
29.1 An 18-year-old with a 1-week history of fever, headache, increasing confusion,
and lethargy presents to the emergency room. His physical examination is normal, and he has no focal neurologic signs. The CT scan of his head is negative.
An LP reveals a WBC count of 250/mm3, with 78% lymphocytes and red
blood cells (RBCs) 500/mm3 in tube 1 and 630/mm3 in tube 2, respectively.
No organisms are seen on Gram stain. Which of the following is the best next
step?
A. Intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and vancomycin
B. Intravenous fluconazole
C. Intravenous azithromycin
D. Careful observation with no antibiotics
29.2 A 55-year-old man with a long history of alcohol abuse presents with a 3-week
history of progressive confusion and stupor. On examination he is afebrile,
but he has a new right sixth cranial nerve palsy and tremulousness of all four
extremities. His CSF has 250 WBCs/mm3, with 68% lymphocytes. There are
300 RBCs/mm3. Protein levels are high, and the ratio of CSF to serum glucose
is very low. He is started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and acyclovir. A puriﬁed protein derivative (PPD) placed on admission is positive, and bacterial
cultures are negative at 48 hours. Which of the following would help to
conﬁrm the diagnosis?
A. Gram stain of throat scrapings
B. CT of the head with contrast
C. MRI of the head
D. Repeat LP after 48 hours of therapy
E. Herpes simplex virus PCR

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

29.3 A 65-year-old man with colon cancer on chemotherapy presents with a fever
and headache of 3-day duration. An LP is performed, and Gram stain reveals
gram-positive rods. Which of the following therapies is most likely to treat the
organism?
A. Vancomycin
B. Metronidazole
C. Ampicillin
D. Gentamicin
E. Ceftriaxone

ANSWERS
29.1 A. This young man most likely has viral meningitis given the modest CSF
pleocytosis count with predominant lymphocytes. Given the high RBC count,
it may be HSV, so acyclovir should be instituted until more speciﬁc testing can
be done. However, because bacterial meningitis cannot be excluded based on
the CSF analysis alone, empiric antibacterials should be given until culture
results are known, usually within 48 hours.
29.2 D. Tuberculous meningitis is extremely difﬁcult to diagnose, and the index of
suspicion should be high in susceptible individuals. Certain clinical ﬁndings,
such as nerve palsies, and CSF ﬁndings, such as an extremely low glucose and
high protein levels with a fairly low WBC count, are highly suggestive but not
diagnostic. Mortality is high and related to the delay in instituting therapy.
The only deﬁnitive test is acid fast bacillus (AFB) culture, but it can take 6 to
8 weeks to grow. PCR test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is diagnostic if positive; however, the sensitivity is low, so a negative test does not rule out the
disease. Findings such as a positive PPD, or CSF cell counts and protein levels
that do not change with standard antimicrobial or antiviral therapies, can also
suggest the diagnosis. Low CSF glucose is a hallmark of TB meningitis—if the
glucose level falls at 48 hours, it is highly suggestive of TB. A CT scan and an
MRI may demonstrate basilar meningitis in TB, but the ﬁnding is not speciﬁc.
29.3 C. Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod that causes approximately 10%
of all cases of meningitis. It is more common in the elderly and in other patients
with impaired cell-mediated immunity, such as patients on chemotherapy. It
is also more common in neonates. It is not sensitive to cephalosporins, and
speciﬁc therapy with ampicillin must be instituted if the suspicion for this
disease is high.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

267

CLINICAL PEARLS


In general, a lumbar puncture should not be delayed in a patient in whom
meningitis is suspected. If lumbar puncture is contraindicated or impossible because of hemodynamic or other instability, empiric therapy should
be started immediately after blood cultures are drawn.



CT imaging of the brain prior to lumbar puncture is not necessary in
most cases, but should be considered when the risk of brain herniation
is high. These findings include new-onset seizures, signs suspicious for
space-occupying lesions (such as papilledema and focal neurologic signs),
and moderate to severe impairment in consciousness.



The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults is S pneumoniae,
followed by N meningitides. Listeria monocytogenes meningitis occurs in
neonates and in immunocompromised or older patients.



Patients who have undergone neurosurgical procedures or who have
been subject to skull trauma are at risk for staphylococcal meningitis.



Hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid with evidence of temporal lobe involvement by imaging or EEG suggests herpes simplex virus encephalitis;
acyclovir is the treatment of choice.

CASE 30
A 28-year-old man comes to the emergency room complaining of 6 days of fever
with shaking chills. Over the past 2 days, he has also developed a productive
cough with greenish sputum, which occasionally is blood streaked. He reports
no dyspnea, but sometimes experiences chest pain on deep inspiration. He does
not have headache, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea. He
has no significant medical history. He smokes cigarettes and marijuana regularly,
drinks several beers daily, but denies intravenous drug use.
On examination, his temperature is 102.5°F, heart rate 109 bpm, blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute. He is alert
and talkative. He has no oral lesions, and funduscopic examination reveals no
abnormalities. His jugular veins show prominent V waves, and his heart rhythm
is tachycardic but regular with a harsh holosystolic murmur at the left lower
sternal border that increases with inspiration. Chest examination reveals inspiratory rales bilaterally. On both of his forearms, he has linear streaks of induration,
hyperpigmentation, and some small nodules overlying the superficial veins, but
no erythema, warmth, or tenderness.
Laboratory examination is significant for an elevated white blood cell (WBC)
count at 17,500/mm3, with 84% polymorphonuclear cells, 7% band forms, and
9% lymphocytes, a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL, hematocrit 42%, and
platelet count 189,000/mm3. Liver function tests and urinalysis are normal. Chest
radiograph shows multiple peripheral, ill-defined nodules, some with cavitation.

ANSWERS TO CASE 30:
Endocarditis (Tricuspid)/Septic Pulmonary Emboli
Summary: A 28-year-old man complains of shaking chills and fever. He also has a
productive cough. He denies intravenous drug use. He has a temperature of 102.5°F,
heart rate 109 bpm, and a new holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border,
which increases with inspiration. He has linear streaks of induration on both forearms, and chest radiograph shows multiple ill-defined nodules.
• Most likely diagnosis: Infective endocarditis involving the tricuspid valve,
with probable septic pulmonary emboli.
• Next step: Obtain serial blood cultures and institute empiric broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the differences in clinical presentation between acute and subacute,
and left-sided versus right-sided endocarditis.
2. Learn the most common organisms that cause endocarditis, including “culturenegative” endocarditis.
3. Know the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to infective endocarditis, including the indications for valve replacement.
4. Understand the complications of endocarditis.

Considerations
Although this patient denied parenteral drug use, his track marks on the forearms
are very suspicious for intravenous drug abuse. He has fever, a new heart murmur
very typical of tricuspid regurgitation, and a chest radiograph suggestive of septic
pulmonary emboli. Serial blood cultures, ideally obtained before antibiotics are
started, are essential to establish the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The rapidity with which antibiotics are started depends on the clinical presentation of the
patient: a septic, critically ill patient needs antibiotics immediately; a patient with a
subacute presentation can wait many hours while cultures are obtained.

INFECTIOUS ENDOCARDITIS: A microbial process of the endocardium, usually involving the heart valves.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

271

JANEWAY LESIONS: Painless hemorrhagic macules on the palms and soles that
are consistent with infectious endocarditis, thought to be caused by septic emboli,
resulting in microabscesses.
OSLER NODES: Painful, palpable, erythematous lesions most often involving the
pads of the fingers and toes, they represent vasculitic lesions caused by immune
complexes.
ROTH SPOTS: Hemorrhagic retinal lesions with white centers, due to infectious
endocarditis, also thought to be an immune-complex–mediated vasculitis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The clinical presentation depends upon the valves involved (left-sided vs right-sided),
as well as the virulence of the organism. Highly virulent species, such as Staphylococcus
aureus, produce acute infection, and less virulent organisms, such as the viridans
group of streptococci, tend to produce a more subacute illness, which may evolve
over weeks. Fever is present in 95% of all cases. For acute endocarditis, patients
often present with high fever, acute valvular regurgitation, and embolic phenomena
(eg, to the extremities or to the brain, causing stroke). Subacute endocarditis is
more often associated with constitutional symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss,
night sweats, and findings attributable to immune-complex deposition and vasculitis;
these include petechiae, splenomegaly, glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Janeway
lesions, and Roth spots. These classic peripheral lesions, although frequently
discussed, are actually seen in only 20% to 25% of cases. Splinter hemorrhages
under the nails may also be seen, but this finding is very nonspecific.
Right-sided endocarditis usually involves the tricuspid valve, causing pulmonary
emboli, rather than involving the systemic circulation. Accordingly, patients
develop pleuritic chest pain, purulent sputum, or hemoptysis, and radiographs may
show multiple peripheral nodular lesions, often with cavitation. The murmur of
tricuspid regurgitation may not be present, especially early in the illness.
In all cases of endocarditis, the critical finding is bacteremia, which usually is
sustained. The initiating event is a transient bacteremia, which may be a result of
mucosal injury, as in dental extraction, or a complication of the use of intravascular
catheters. Bacteria are then able to seed valvular endothelium. Previously damaged,
abnormal, or prosthetic valves form vegetations, which are composed of platelets
and fibrin, and are relatively avascular sites where bacteria may grow protected from
immune attack.
Serial blood cultures are the most important step in the diagnosis of endocarditis. Acutely ill patients should have three blood cultures obtained over a 2- to
3-hour period prior to initiating antibiotics. In subacute disease, three blood cultures
over a 24-hour period maximize the diagnostic yield. Of course, if patients are critically ill or hemodynamically unstable, no delay in initiating therapy is appropriate,
and cultures are obtained on presentation, even while broad-spectrum antibiotics
are administered. Usually it is not difficult to isolate the infecting organism,
because the hallmark of infective endocarditis is sustained bacteremia; thus, all
blood cultures often are positive for the microorganism. Table 30–1 lists typical
organisms, frequency of infection, and associated conditions.

Culture-negative endocarditis, an uncommon situation in which routine cultures
fail to grow, is most likely a result of prior antibiotic treatment, fungal infection (fungi
other than Candida spp. often require special culture media), or fastidious organisms.
These organisms can include Abiotrophia spp, Bartonella spp, Coxiella burnetii,
Legionella spp, Chlamydia, and the HACEK organisms (Haemophilus aphrophilus/
paraphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella
corrodens, Kingella kingae). The clinical features, blood cultures, and echocardiography
are used to diagnose cases of infective endocarditis using the highly sensitive and
specific Duke criteria. It should be noted that transesophageal echocardiography
(TEE) rather than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the method of choice
in assessing these vegetations. Endocarditis is considered to definitely be present if
the patient satisfies two major criteria; one major and three minor criteria; or five
minor criteria (Table 30–2).

Table 30–2 • DUKE CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOCARDITIS
Major criteria
• Isolation of typical organisms (viridans streptococci, S aureus, enterococci, Streptococcus bovis,
or one of the HACEK organisms) from two separate blood cultures, or persistently positive
blood cultures with other organisms
• Evidence of endocardial involvement: either echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis, eg,
oscillating intracardiac mass, or new valvular regurgitation
Minor criteria
• Predisposing valvular lesion or intravenous drug use
• Fever >100.4°F (38.0°C)
• Vascular phenomena: arterial or septic pulmonary emboli, mycotic aneurysm, Janeway lesions
• Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots, positive rheumatoid
factor
• Positive blood cultures not meeting major criteria

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

273

One life-threatening complication of endocarditis is congestive heart failure,
usually as a consequence of infection-induced valvular damage. Other cardiac complications are intracardiac abscesses and conduction disturbances caused by septal
involvement by infection. Systemic arterial embolization may lead to splenic or
renal infarction or abscesses. Vegetations may embolize to the coronary circulation,
causing a myocardial infarction, or to the brain, causing a cerebral infarction. A
stroke syndrome in a febrile patient should always suggest the possibility of endocarditis. Infection of the vasa vasorum may weaken the wall of major arteries and
produce mycotic aneurysms, which can occur anywhere but are most common in the
cerebral circulation, sinuses of Valsalva, or abdominal aorta. These aneurysms may
leak or rupture, producing sudden fatal intracranial or other hemorrhage.
Antibiotic treatment is usually begun in the hospital but because of the prolonged nature of therapy is often completed on an outpatient basis when the patient
is clinically stable. Treatment generally lasts 4 to 6 weeks. If the organism is susceptible, such as most Streptococcus species, penicillin G is the agent of choice. For
S aureus, nafcillin is the drug of choice, often used in combination with gentamicin
initially for synergy, to help resolve bacteremia. Therapy for intravenous drug users
should be directed against S aureus. Vancomycin is used when methicillin-resistant
S aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci are present. Ceftriaxone is the usual
therapy for the HACEK group of organisms. Deciding appropriate therapy for
culture-negative endocarditis may be challenging and depends on the clinical
situation.
Table 30–3 summarizes the commonly recognized indications for surgical intervention: valve excision and replacement.
Patients at high risk for developing infective endocarditis benefit from antibiotic
prophylaxis prior to dental procedures. The most recent American Heart Association
guidelines (2008) specify the following individuals:
• Prosthetic heart valves
• Previous infective endocarditis
• Congenital heart disease (unrepaired cyanotic coronary heart disease [CHD]
including palliative shunts and conduits)
• Completely repaired CHD repaired with prosthetic material or device during
the first 6 postoperative months

Table 30–3 • INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF
ENDOCARDITIS
Intractable congestive heart failure caused by valve dysfunction, >1 serious systemic embolic
episode, or large (>10 mm) vegetation with high risk for embolism
Uncontrolled infection, eg, positive cultures after 7 d of therapy
No effective antimicrobial therapy (eg, fungal endocarditis)
Most cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, especially S aureus prosthetic valve infection
Local suppurative complications, eg, myocardial abscess

274

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

• Repaired CHD with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a
prosthetic patch or prosthetic device
• Valve regurgitation caused by a structurally abnormal valve in cardiac transplant recipients
Amoxicillin is the drug of choice for prophylaxis unless the patient is allergic
to penicillin or unable to take medications by mouth. Alternatives for use in
these situations include ampicillin, cephalosporins, or clindamycin.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
30.1 A 68-year-old man is hospitalized with Streptococcus bovis endocarditis of the
mitral valve and recovers completely with appropriate therapy. Which of the
following is the most important next step?
A. Good dental hygiene and proper denture fitting to prevent reinfection of
damaged heart valves from oral flora.
B. Repeat echocardiography in 6 weeks to ensure the vegetations have
resolved.
C. Colonoscopy to look for mucosal lesions.
D. Mitral valve replacement to prevent systemic emboli such as cerebral
infarction.
30.2 A 24-year-old intravenous drug user is admitted with 4 weeks of fever. He has
three blood cultures positive with Candida spp and suddenly develops a cold
blue toe. Which of the following is the appropriate next step?
A. Repeat echocardiography to see if the large aortic vegetation previously
seen has now embolized.
B. Cardiovascular surgery consultation for aortic valve replacement.
C. Aortic angiography to evaluate for a mycotic aneurysm, which may be
embolizing.
D. Switch from fluconazole to amphotericin B.
30.3 A patient with which of the following conditions requires antimicrobial prophylaxis before dental surgery?
A. Atrial septal defect
B. Mitral valve prolapse without mitral regurgitation
C. Previous coronary artery bypass graft
D. Previous infective endocarditis

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

275

ANSWERS
30.1 C. Colonoscopy is necessary because a signiﬁcant number of patients with
S bovis endocarditis have a colonic cancer or premalignant polyp, which leads
to seeding of the valve by gastrointestinal (GI) ﬂora. Heart valves damaged
by endocarditis are more susceptible to infection, so good dental hygiene is
important, but in this case, the organism came from the intestinal tract, not
the mouth, and the possibility of malignancy is most important to address.
Serial echocardiography would not add to the patient’s care after successful
therapy, because vegetations become organized and persist for months or years
without late embolization. Prophylactic valve replacement would not be indicated, because the prosthetic valve is even more susceptible to reinfection
than the damaged native valve and would actually increase the risk of cerebral
infarction or other systemic emboli as a consequence of thrombus formation,
even if adequately anticoagulated.
30.2 B. Fungal endocarditis, which occurs in intravenous drug users or immunosuppressed persons with indwelling catheters, frequently gives rise to large friable
vegetations with a high risk of embolization (often to the lower extremities)
and is very difﬁcult to cure with antifungal medications. Valve replacement is
usually necessary. Repeat echocardiography would not add to the patient’s care,
because the clinical diagnosis of peripheral embolization is almost certain, and
it would not change the management. Medical therapy with any antifungal
agent is unlikely to cure this infection. Mycotic aneurysms may occur in any
artery as a consequence of endocarditis and can cause late embolic complications, but in this case, the source probably is the heart.
30.3 D. Prior endocarditis damages valvular surfaces, and these patients are at
increased risk for reinfection during a transient bacteremia, as may occur during dental procedures or some other GI or genitourinary tract procedures. All
of the other conditions mentioned have a negligible risk of endocarditis, the
same as in the general population, and antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended by the American Heart Association.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

CLINICAL PEARLS


The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is established by using clinical
criteria, the most important of which are sustained bacteremia and evidence of endocardial involvement, usually by echocardiography.



Right-sided endocarditis may be difficult to diagnose because it lacks the
systemic emboli seen in left-sided endocarditis, and the new murmur of
tricuspid regurgitation is often not heard.



Left-sided native valve endocarditis usually is caused by Streptococcus
viridans, S aureus, and Enterococcus. The large majority of right-sided
endocarditis is caused by S aureus.



Valve replacement usually is necessary for persistent infection, recurrent embolization, or when medical therapy is ineffective, for example, in
cases of large vegetations as seen in fungal endocarditis.



Culture-negative endocarditis usually is caused by prior administration of
antibiotics before obtaining blood cultures or by infection with fungi or
fastidious organisms such as the HACEK group.

CASE 31
A 62-year-old man is brought to the clinic for a 3-month history of unintentional
weight loss (12 lb). His appetite has diminished, but he reports no vomiting or
diarrhea. He does report some depressive symptoms since the death of his wife
a year ago, at which time he moved from Hong Kong to the United States to live
with his daughter. He denies a smoking history. He complains of a 3-month history of productive cough with greenish sputum. He has not felt feverish. He takes
no medications regularly. On examination, his temperature is 100.4°F and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. His neck has a normal thyroid gland and no
cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. His chest has few scattered rales in
the left mid-lung fields and a faint expiratory wheeze on the right. His heart rhythm
is regular with no gallops or murmurs. His abdominal examination is benign, his
rectal examination shows no masses, and his stool is negative for occult blood.

Tuberculosis (Pulmonary), Cavitary Lung Lesions
Summary: A 62-year-old man from Hong Kong has a 12-lb unintentional weight
loss with diminished appetite but no vomiting or diarrhea. On examination, he has
a low-grade fever, and there are a few scattered rales in the left mid-lung fields and
a faint expiratory wheeze on the right. His chest x-ray shows a cavitary lesion (left
lower lobe).
• Most likely diagnosis: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)
• Next step: Refer him to the hospital for admission so that serial sputum samples
can be collected for identification of the organism, and for culture and sensitivities to guide antimicrobial therapy

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

279

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the natural history and the clinical and radiographic manifestations of
primary and reactivation pulmonary TB and of latent TB infection.
2. Understand the methods of diagnosis of TB.
3. Learn treatment strategies for TB.
4. Know the common extrapulmonary sites of TB, including pleurisy, lymphadenitis,
miliary, meningeal, genitourinary, skeletal, and adrenal TB.

Considerations
This elderly Asian gentleman has symptoms suggestive of TB, such as weight loss
and productive cough. A chest radiograph is essential in helping to establish the
diagnosis. His chest x-ray is highly suggestive of TB, but many other diseases may
cause cavitary lung lesions, including other infections and malignancies. If the
sputum samples do not reveal acid-fast organisms, then further testing, such as
bronchoscopy, may be needed to rule out malignancy.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Tuberculosis
DEFINITIONS
LATENT TUBERCULOSIS: Asymptomatic infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PRIMARY TUBERCULOSIS: Development of clinical illness immediately after
infection with M tuberculosis.
REACTIVATION TUBERCULOSIS: Illness that occurs when latent TB
becomes active and infectious after a period of dormancy, such as years after the
initial infection.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pulmonary Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection caused by the acid-fast bacillus (AFB)
M tuberculosis, which usually is transmitted through airborne spread of droplets
from infected patients with pulmonary TB. The vast majority of cases occur in
developing countries, but a resurgence of cases in the United States occurred during
the mid-1980s as a consequence of various factors, including human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) infection. Untreated disease can have a 1-year mortality rate of 33% and a
5-year mortality rate as high as 50%.
Often seen in children, primary pulmonary TB usually affects the middle
and lower lung zones. Lesions form in the periphery with hilar and paratracheal

280

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

lymphadenopathy. Granulomatous lesions are caused by the inflammatory response
of lymphocytes and macrophages. The center of the lesion may become necrotic
(caseous necrosis) and liquefied, forming a cavity. Healed lesions are called Ghon
lesions. Most patients exposed to M tuberculosis do not manifest clinical symptoms,
but they may have a latent infection. Years later, frequently during times of stress
or immunosuppression, TB may reactivate and become symptomatic. Reactivation
TB usually involves the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes or the
superior segments of the lower lobes of the lungs. The course may be rapid (weeks to
months), chronic and slowly progressive (“consumption”), or spontaneously remit.
Signs and symptoms are nonspecific and subacute, including fever, night sweats,
malaise, weight loss, and anorexia. The cough usually is productive of purulent
sputum and sometimes streaked with blood. A lesion may erode into a vessel, causing massive hemoptysis. Rasmussen aneurysm is the rupture of a dilated vessel in
a cavity. Physical findings can include fever, wasting, rales and rhonchi (if there is
a partial bronchial obstruction), pallor, or finger clubbing from hypoxia. Possible
laboratory abnormalities are leukocytosis, anemia, and hyponatremia secondary to
the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis
The sites, in order of decreasing frequency of occurrence, are the lymph nodes, pleura,
genitourinary tract, bones and joints, meninges, and peritoneum. Tuberculosis
lymphadenitis is common in HIV-infected patients, children, and nonwhite women
and generally is painless adenopathy. Pleural disease can have an exudative effusion
but may require pleural biopsy for diagnosis. Tuberculosis meningitis usually has
cerebrospinal fluid with high protein, a lymphocyte predominance (or neutrophils
in early infection), and low glucose level. Adjunctive glucocorticoids may improve
the treatment response in TB meningitis. Genitourinary TB can be asymptomatic
or have local symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, and urinary frequency. It is characterized by the finding of leukocytes in the urine but negative bacterial cultures—
“sterile pyuria.” Skeletal TB affects weight-bearing joints, whereas Pott disease
involves the spine. Miliary TB refers to hematogenously disseminated tuberculosis,
and describes the radiographic or pathologic finding of 1- to 2-mm granulomas that
resemble millet seeds (hence the name). Adrenal involvement is common in military
TB, and may cause adrenal insufficiency.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of TB is made by combining the history and clinical picture with
AFB stains or culture of a specimen (smear or tissue biopsy). When pulmonary TB
is suspected, three samples of early morning sputum should be obtained while the
patient is in isolation. Biopsy material should not be put in formaldehyde. Cultures
may take from 4 to 8 weeks on ordinary solid media or 2 to 3 weeks on liquid media.
Tuberculosis cases should be reported to the local public health department.
Purified protein derivative (PPD), or tuberculin, skin testing is useful for screening for latent TB infection but has a limited role in diagnosing active infection
because of frequent false-negative results in this setting. A positive PPD is defined
by induration of at least 5 mm after 48 to 72 hours (see Table 31–1).

Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are new diagnostic tools for latent
tuberculosis. They are in vitro blood tests of cell-mediated immune response to
M tuberculosis and measure T-cell release of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) following
stimulation by TB antigens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommend that such tests can be used in place of tuberculin skin testing. IGRAs are
preferred for patients with history of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination
(it is not affected by BCG). The most commonly used IGRAs are the Quantiferon
TB Gold assay and the T-SPOT TB assay.

Treatment
The probable resistance pattern of the TB organism, based on the country of origin,
may help to guide treatment. For individuals from areas with low drug resistance,
therapy generally starts with a 2-month course of four-drug treatment with isoniazid
(INH), rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of INH
and rifampin. Multiple drugs are used to avoid resistance. Directly observed treatment (watching patients take the medication) should be instituted in all patients
in this phase. Pyridoxine is frequently added to the regimen to prevent peripheral
neuropathy. Drug resistance or intolerable side effects may require alternate therapy.
Toxicity for which patients must be monitored includes hepatitis, hyperuricemia,
and thrombocytopenia. Treatment failure is defined by positive cultures after 3 months
or positive AFB stains after 5 months and should be treated by adding two more
drugs. Latent TB infection should be treated with INH for 9 months, with the goal
of preventing reactivation TB later in life.

31.3 A 25-year-old woman is seen in the clinic because her father, who recently
immigrated from South America, was diagnosed with and has been treated for
tuberculosis. She denies a cough and her chest radiograph is normal. A PPD

Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Oral isoniazid and barrier contraception.
B. Combination therapy including isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.
C. Observation.
D. Induce three sputum samples.
31.4 Which of the following tests is the most important to follow for a patient
receiving isoniazid and rifampin for tuberculosis treatment?
A. Renal function tests
B. Liver function tests
C. Slit-lamp examinations
D. Amylase and lipase tests

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

283

ANSWERS
31.1 C. Reactivation tuberculosis (in this case, likely triggered by inﬂiximab) usually involves the apical aspects of the lungs. Primary TB infection most often
affects the middle and lower lung zones. Lymphadenitis and pleural infection
are the most common extrapulmonary sites of TB, but they are less common
than pulmonary TB.
31.2 B. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is important for preventing the peripheral neuropathy that can complicate isoniazid therapy. If the numbness were caused by
Pott disease, he should have back pain and other neurologic ﬁndings, such as
lower extremity weakness.
31.3 A. Because this woman is a household contact of a patient with active TB, she
is among the highest risk group: her skin test would be considered positive with
5 mm induration. She has latent TB infection and should be offered treatment
to prevent reactivation TB later in life. Oral contraceptives may reduce drug
levels, so barrier contraception might be a better option for her.
31.4 B. Drug-induced hepatitis is a common complication of isoniazid and rifampin
and requires periodic surveillance. Alcohol use, prior liver disease, and increased
age are risk factors.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Reactivation pulmonary tuberculosis most commonly presents radiographically with infiltrates or nodules in the apical and posterior segments
of the upper lobes.



Tuberculin skin testing is not a diagnostic test but is a useful screening
test for potential contacts of infected persons; the response cutoff for
a positive test depends on the patient’s level of risk. IGRAs such as TB
Quantiferon Gold are also useful to diagnose latent TB.



Patients with a positive tuberculin skin test and no clinical or radiographic
evidence of active disease are said to have latent tuberculosis infection;
they can be treated with isoniazid to reduce their lifetime risk of developing reactivation tuberculosis.



Individuals with active tuberculosis should be initiated on multidrug therapy,
such as isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.



Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is usually added to antituberculosis medications
to prevent peripheral neuropathy.

ANSWERS TO CASE 32:
Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade Caused by Malignancy
Summary: A 42-year-old man with a thoracic malignancy and history of radiotherapy to the mediastinum now presents with chest pain, dyspnea, cardiac enlargement
on chest x-ray (which could represent cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion), jugular
venous distention, distant cardiac sounds, and pulsus paradoxus.
• Most likely diagnosis: Pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade
• Next therapeutic step: Urgent pericardiocentesis or surgical pericardial window

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize pericardial tamponade; know how to check for pulsus paradoxus.
2. Know the features of cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, and restrictive
cardiomyopathy and how to distinguish among them.
3. Understand the treatment of each of these conditions.
4. Know the potential cardiac complications of thoracic malignancies and radiation
therapy.

Considerations
The patient described in the scenario, with his thoracic malignancy and history of
radiation therapy, is at risk for diseases of the pericardium and myocardium. The
jugular venous distention, distant heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus all are suggestive of cardiac tamponade. The major diagnostic considerations in this case, each
with a very different treatment, are pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade,
constrictive pericarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. All of these conditions
can impede diastolic filling of the heart and lead to cardiovascular compromise.
Urgent differentiation among these conditions is required, because the treatment
is very different and the consequences of these diseases can be immediately fatal.
Clinically, the patient’s fall in systolic blood pressure with inspiration, pulsus paradoxus, is suggestive of cardiac tamponade, which would be treated by evacuating
the pericardial fluid.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

287

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Cardiac Tamponade
DEFINITIONS
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Fluid that fills the pericardial space, which may be
due to infection, hemorrhage, or malignancy. A rapidly accumulating effusion may
lead to cardiac compromise.
CARDIAC TAMPONADE: Increased pressure within the pericardial space
caused by an accumulating effusion, which compresses the heart and impedes
diastolic filling.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Cardiac tamponade refers to increased pressure within the pericardial space caused
by an accumulating effusion, which compresses the heart and impedes diastolic filling. Because the heart can only pump out during systole what it receives during
diastole, severe restrictions of diastolic filling lead to a marked decrease in cardiac
output, which can cause cardiovascular collapse and death. If pericardial fluid accumulates slowly, the sac may dilate and hold up to 2000 mL (producing amazing
cardiomegaly on chest x-ray) before causing diastolic impairment. If the fluid accumulates rapidly, as in a hemopericardium caused by trauma or surgery, as little as 200 mL
can produce tamponade. The classic description of Beck triad (hypotension, elevated
jugular venous pressure, and small quiet heart) is a description of acute tamponade
with rapid accumulation of fluid, as in cardiac trauma or ventricular rupture. If the
fluid accumulates slowly, the clinical picture may look more like congestive heart
failure, with cardiomegaly on chest x-ray (although there should be no pulmonary
edema), dyspnea, elevated jugular pressure, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema. A
high index of suspicion is required, and cardiac tamponade should be considered in
any patient with hypotension and elevated jugular venous pressure.
The most important physical sign to look for in cardiac tamponade is pulsus
paradoxus. This refers to a drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration of
more than 10 mm Hg. Although called “paradoxical,” this drop in systolic blood
pressure is actually not contrary to the normal physiologic variation with respiration; it is an exaggeration of the normal small drop in systolic pressure during inspiration. Although not a specific sign of tamponade (ie, it is often seen in patients
with disturbed intrathoracic pressures during respiration, eg, those with obstructive
lung disease), the paradoxical pulse is fairly sensitive for hemodynamically significant tamponade in almost all cases. To test for this, one must use a manual blood
pressure cuff that is inflated above systolic pressure and deflated very slowly until
the first Korotkoff sound is heard during expiration and then, finally, during both
phases of respiration. The difference between these two pressure readings is the
pulsus paradoxus. When the pulsus paradoxus is severe, it may be detected by palpation as a diminution or disappearance of peripheral pulses during inspiration.
Constrictive pericarditis is a complication of previous pericarditis, either acute
or chronic fibrinous pericarditis. The inflammation with resultant granulation tissue

288

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

forms a thickened fibrotic adherent sac that gradually contracts, encasing the heart
and impairing diastolic filling. In the past, tuberculosis was the most common cause
of this problem but now is rare in the United States. Currently, this is most commonly
caused by radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, or any cause of acute pericarditis, such
as viral infection, uremia, or malignancy. The pathophysiology of constrictive pericarditis is similar to that of cardiac tamponade in the restricted ability of the ventricles
to fill during diastole because of the thickened noncompliant pericardium.
Because the process is chronic, patients with constrictive pericarditis generally
do not present with acute hemodynamic collapse but rather with chronic and slowly
progressive weakness and fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Patients commonly have
what appears to be right-sided heart failure, that is, chronic lower extremity edema,
hepatomegaly, and ascites. Like patients with tamponade, they have elevated jugular
venous pressures, but pulsus paradoxus usually is absent. Examination of neck veins
shows an increase in jugular venous pressure during inspiration, termed Kussmaul
sign. This is easy to see because it is the opposite of the normal fall in pressure as a
person inspires. Normally, the negative intrathoracic pressure generated by inspiration sucks blood into the heart, but because of the severe diastolic restriction, the
blood cannot enter the right atrium or ventricle, so it fills the jugular vein. Another
physical finding characteristic of constrictive pericarditis is a pericardial knock,
which is a high-pitched early diastolic sound occurring just after aortic valve closure.
Chest radiography frequently shows cardiomegaly and a calcified pericardium.
Restrictive cardiomyopathy, like the previous diagnoses, is primarily a problem
of impaired diastolic filling, usually with preserved systolic function. This is a relatively uncommon problem in the Western world. The most common causes are
amyloidosis, an infiltrative disease of the elderly, in which an abnormal fibrillar
amyloid protein is deposited in heart muscle, or fibrosis of the myocardium following radiation therapy or open heart surgery. In Africa, restrictive cardiomyopathy
is much more common because of a process called endomyocardial fibrosis, characterized by fibrosis of the endocardium along with fever and marked eosinophilia,
accounting for up to 25% of deaths due to heart disease.
Clinically, it may be very difficult to distinguish restrictive cardiomyopathy from
constrictive pericarditis, and various echocardiographic criteria have been proposed to
try to distinguish between them. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be
very useful to visualize or exclude the presence of the thickened pericardium typical of
constrictive pericarditis. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to obtain an endomyocardial
biopsy to make the diagnosis. Differentiation between the two is essential because
constrictive pericarditis is a potentially curable disease, whereas very little effective
therapy is available for either the underlying conditions or the cardiac failure of
restrictive cardiomyopathy. Table 32–1 compares features of cardiac tamponade,
acute pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and constrictive pericarditis.

Treatment
Treatment of cardiac tamponade consists of relief of the pericardial pressure, either
by echocardiographically guided pericardiocentesis or a surgical pericardial window.
Resection of the pericardium is the definitive treatment of constrictive pericarditis.
There is no effective treatment for restrictive cardiomyopathy.

constrictive pericarditis.
32.2 B. Pulsus paradoxus is a sensitive although nonspeciﬁc sign for cardiac
tamponade.

disease processes mentioned are causes of dilated cardiomyopathy.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Elevated jugular venous pressure and pulsus paradoxus are features of
cardiac tamponade.



Kussmaul sign and right-sided heart failure are features of constrictive
cardiomyopathy, but pulsus paradoxus is not.



Cardiac tamponade requires urgent treatment by pericardiocentesis or a
pericardial window.



Constrictive pericarditis may show calcifications of the pericardium on
chest x-ray or thickened pericardium on echocardiography. Definitive
therapy is resection of the pericardium.

CASE 33
A 23-year-old man is the next patient you see in the clinic. Under chief complaint,
the nurse has written, “Wants a general checkup.” You enter the room and greet
a generally healthy-appearing young, white man, who seems nervous. He finally
admits that he has been worried about a lesion on his penis. He denies pain or
dysuria. He has never had any sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and has an
otherwise unremarkable medical history. He is afebrile, and his examination is
notable for a shallow clean ulcer without exudates or erythema on the shaft of his
penis, which is nontender to palpation, and has a cartilaginous consistency. There
are some small, nontender, inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally.

ANSWERS TO CASE 33:
Syphilis
Summary: A 23-year-old healthy man reluctantly requests evaluation of a lesion on
his penis. He has never had any STDs and has an otherwise unremarkable medical
history. He is afebrile, and his examination is notable for a firm nontender ulcer on
his penis with small, nontender inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally.
• Most likely diagnosis: Chancre of primary syphilis
• Likely treatment: Single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathogenesis and natural history of Treponema pallidum infection.
2. Know the differential diagnosis of genital ulceration and STDs.
3. Learn the treatment of syphilis.

Considerations
This 23-year-old man reluctantly reveals his concern about a nontender ulcer of the
penis. Although he has no history of STD, the most common cause of a painless
ulcer of the genital area in a young, immunocompetent person is syphilis. The STDs
often travel together, so he should be evaluated for other STDs such as chlamydia
and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other causes of genital ulcers should
also be considered, including chancroid and herpes virus (both usually painful), and
a superficially infected skin lesion. Compliance with therapy and follow-up are
crucial because syphilitic infections can progress to a chronic form that can lead to
aneurysmal dilation of the aorta as well as permanent neurologic changes. He could
continue spreading the disease to others, and if he infects women of childbearing
age, these women, if infected during pregnancy, could pass the infection to their
newborns.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Syphilis
DEFINITIONS
PRIMARY SYPHILIS: Initial lesion of T pallidum infection, usually in the form of
a firm, nontender ulcer: the chancre.
SECONDARY SYPHILIS: Disseminated infection manifesting in a pruritic, maculopapular diffuse rash that classically involves the palms and soles, or the flat moist
lesion of condyloma lata.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

293

TERTIARY (LATE) SYPHILIS: Symptomatic infection involving the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, or the skin and subcutaneous tissues
(gummas).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Syphilis is classically called the “great imitator” for its protean manifestations. After
a decline in cases over the prior decades, the incidence of syphilis has been increasing since the 1980s. The public health consequences can be grave, so recognizing
and correctly treating this disease is of great importance. An estimated 70 000 new
cases of syphilis occur every year in the United States. Most occur in young adults in
their twenties, and most cases are concentrated in the southern states. The number
of cases reached its lowest point in the 1980s; however, these have increased since
then, especially in heterosexuals, young women, and neonates. Some researchers
believe this increase may be a result of cocaine use, sex for drugs trade, and perhaps
the increased incidence of HIV infections.
Syphilis is caused by the spirochete T pallidum. The organism penetrates abraded
skin or mucous membranes and then disseminates through the lymphatics and
bloodstream to involve almost every organ. Within 1 week to 3 months of inoculation, a chancre usually forms at the site of entrance. Multiple ulcers may form, as in
HIV-infected patients, but some patients may not notice the ulceration at all. The
chancre of syphilis typically is nonerythematous, with rolled borders and a clean
base, with a very firm consistency on palpation. It usually is painless, although it
may be mildly tender if touched. Other diseases that can cause ulcerations include
chancroid; however the ulcer in this disease usually is painful, exudative, with
ragged borders and a necrotic base, and bleeds easily. The lymph nodes can also
suppurate in chancroid, unlike in syphilis. The ulcers in herpes simplex infections
typically are painful, grouped vesicles on an erythematous base that eventually
ulcerate.
If untreated, syphilis progresses to a second stage, in which the disease disseminates widely, and the patient may present with a pruritic, maculopapular diffuse
rash that classically involves the palms and soles. Patients also may have these
lesions orally, called “mucous patches,” and they may suffer constitutional symptoms such as fever, myalgias, and headache. Other typical skin findings include
condyloma lata, a gray papillomatous lesion found in intertriginous areas, and
patchy hair loss.
If still left untreated, the patient will pass into a quiescent, or latent, stage.
Although relapses of symptoms of secondary syphilis can occur during this time,
they become less frequent over years. Approximately 30% of patients will go on to
develop late-stage syphilis. The symptoms of this stage result from the destruction
of tissue caused by the chronic infection. The immune reaction to the organism
causes a proliferative, obliterative endarteritis. In some organs, such as the skin,
liver, and bone, these lesions are organized into granulomas with an amorphous or
coagulated center called gummas. These lesions, in themselves, are benign; however, they can cause organ dysfunction through destruction of normal tissue. In the
aorta, the obliterative endarteritis involves the vasa vasorum, which leads to necrosis

294

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

of the media of the arterial wall. The resulting weakness of the wall leads to the
formation of saccular aneurysmal dilations of the aorta.
Neurosyphilis is another form of tertiary disease that may occur after secondary disease or from the latent stage. The organism disseminates to the central nervous system (CNS), causing a broad range of neurologic symptoms. In the CNS,
it may cause vasculitis, leading to ischemia, stroke, and focal neurologic deficits.
Patients may exhibit personality changes or dementia, demyelination of the
posterior column with wide-based gait and loss of proprioception (tabes dorsalis),
or cranial nerve impairment, including the development of the Argyll Robertson
pupil (accommodates but does not react to light). Lumbar puncture to exclude
neurosyphilis is generally indicated when any patient with syphilis develops neurologic
or ocular symptoms or if HIV-infected patients with syphilis are relatively immunosuppressed (CD4 <350) or have a high rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer (>1:32).
The diagnosis of syphilis is always made indirectly, as the organism has not yet
been cultured. Nonspecific serologic tests, such as the RPR and Venereal Disease
Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests, which actually are tests for antibodies against
lipid antigens that occur as part of the host reaction to T pallidum, are fairly sensitive
for the detection of disease. However, especially at low titers, they may be nonspecific and may result in false-positive results. Therefore, confirmatory testing in the
form of specific antibody testing for T pallidum, such as the fluorescent treponemal
antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or microhemagglutination assay for Treponema
pallidum (MHA-TP) test, is the next step. Dark-field microscopy, in which scrapings from an ulcer are placed under a phase contrast lens to actually identify the
organisms, is the classic method of diagnosis but is rarely performed today. Biopsy of
lesions, such as those seen in secondary syphilis with special stains, also can identify
the organisms. To diagnose CNS disease, a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VDRL
or RPR in the setting of increased CSF leukocytosis and protein counts, sometimes
with low glucose levels, is suggestive of CNS involvement. False-negative results for
VDRL in CSF are common, however, and the diagnosis is often made on clinical
grounds.
Penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis. The most effective treatment
and regimen, however, are truly unknown, because no therapeutic trials have been
performed. However, current recommendations are to treat syphilis based on the
stage of presentation (Table 33–1). Individuals with early disease, that is, with primary or secondary syphilis, or those with early latent syphilis (infection for <1 year)
may be treated with a single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G, a
long-lasting intramuscular (IM) injection. For patients with late disease, that is,
latent syphilis of an unknown duration (presumed to be >1 year), or with cardiovascular manifestations or with gummas, treatment is given as three weekly IM injections of benzathine penicillin G.
Neurosyphilis is notoriously difficult to treat. Those with CNS disease or patients
concurrently infected with HIV and syphilis should receive high doses of intravenous penicillin G for 10 to 14 days or longer. All patients should be followed closely
to ensure that their titers fall over the year after treatment. Pregnant women who
are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and then receive penicillin, because
this is the only treatment known to prevent congenital infection.

Treponema pallidum infection usually leads to a positive specific serologic test
(FTA-ABS or MHA-TP) for life, whereas an adequately treated infection will lead
to a fall in RPR serology. A normal response is considered a fourfold drop in titers
within 3 months and a negative or near-negative titer after 1 year. A suboptimal
response may mean inadequate treatment or undiagnosed tertiary disease.
In any patient diagnosed with an STD, the possibility that they may have other
STDs should be considered.
Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STD, and can be asymptomatic, especially in women. In females, it can cause cervicitis (vaginal discharge, post coital
bleeding) and urethritis (dysuria or UTI symptoms). It may also cause pelvic inflammatory disease (lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge or dysuria, with fever and
systemic symptoms), which can lead to infertility due to tubal scarring. Men with
symptoms typically present with urethritis (dysuria, urethral discharge), but may
also experience epididymitis (scrotal pain and fever) or proctitis (rectal pain or diarrhea). Diagnosis is usually made by antigen detection or gene probe from urethra
or cervix. Treatment is usually single-dose azithromycin or a course of doxycycline.
Gonorrhea due to the gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria gonorrhoeae can
cause identical clinical syndromes as Chlamydia (in fact, up to 30% of patients are
coinfected with both organisms), but patients are less likely to be asymptomatic,
especially men. It may also cause disseminated infection characterized by fever,
migratory polyarthritis, tenosynovitis of hands and feet, and a rash on the distal
extremities. Patients with disseminated infection require hospitalization for IV antibiotics, usually ceftriaxone. Outpatients with genitourinary symptoms are treated
with a single IM injection of ceftriaxone, and are typically given azithromycin or
doxycycline for Chlamydia coinfection.
HIV is often asymptomatic early in the course of infection, and screening should
be recommended to those persons who have histories of high-risk behaviors or who
have evidence of other STDs.

33.4 A 28-year-old woman is noted to have a nontender ulcer of the vulva. A
herpes culture is taken of the ulcer scraping, which is negative, and the RPR
titer is negative. Which of the following is the next best step?
A. Empiric treatment with doxycycline for Chlamydia trachomatis
B. Empiric treatment with acyclovir for herpes simplex virus (HSV)
C. Empiric treatment with azithromycin for Haemophilus ducreyi
D. Dark-field microscopy
E. Biopsy for possible vulvar cancer

ANSWERS
33.1 B. The triad of uveitis or conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthritis is characteristic of reactive arthritis or Reiter syndrome. This poorly understood
disease is thought to be caused by immune cross-reaction between antigens
in infectious organisms and the host connective tissue. Organisms commonly
involved include C trachomatis, which this patient may have contracted when
he contracted syphilis but which may not have been treated. The arthritis
typically involves large joints and is both progressive and additive. The uveitis
can be difﬁcult to treat; however, the dysuria of the urethritis can be transient.
Patients with Reiter syndrome are often HLA-B27 positive.
33.2 D. This patient should be desensitized and treated with penicillin, especially
because she is pregnant and may pass the disease to her child. Following treatment, her titers should be closely followed and should show at least a fourfold
decrease. Treatment of the child after delivery with intravascular (IV) penicillin should be considered.
33.3 A. Lumbar puncture to exclude neurosyphilis is generally indicated when any
patient with syphilis develops neurologic or ocular symptoms, or if HIV-infected
patients with syphilis have a CD4 less than 350 or an RPR more than 1:32.
33.4 D. Approximately one-third of patients who have the primary lesion of the
chancre will have negative serology and require either dark-ﬁeld microscopy
or biopsy with special stains to identify the spirochetes. The organism is too
thin to be visualized by conventional light microscopy. Empiric treatment with
penicillin is reasonable if dark-ﬁeld microscopy is not available. Genital herpes
and chancroid should produce painful genital ulcers, and Chlamydia should
cause nonulcerative cervicitis or urethritis.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

CLINICAL PEARLS


Syphilitic chancres are generally clean, painless, ulcerative lesions and
can be located anywhere on the body where inoculation occurred.



The rash of secondary syphilis typically involves the palms and soles.



Elevated RPR and VDRL tests are nonspecific and may be falsely positive
in several normal conditions (pregnancy) and disease states (systemic
lupus erythematosus). Specific treponemal antibody tests, such as the
microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) and
the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, should
be performed for confirmation, but once positive, they usually stay positive for life.



A declining RPR titer can be followed to test the efficacy of therapy.



Central nervous system involvement can be excluded only through testing of the cerebrospinal fluid.



Treatment of syphilis is based on stage: early syphilis can be treated with
a single intramuscular injection of penicillin; late latent syphilis can be
treated with three weekly injections; and neurosyphilis or tertiary syphilis
can be treated with intravenous penicillin for 10 to 14 days.

CASE 34
A 58-year-old man comes to see you because of shortness of breath. He has experienced mild dyspnea on exertion for a few years, but more recently he has noted
worsening shortness of breath with minimal exercise and the onset of dyspnea
at rest. He has difficulty reclining, and, as a result, he spends the night sitting up
in a chair trying to sleep. He reports a cough with production of yellowish-brown
sputum every morning throughout the year. He denies chest pain, fever, chills,
or lower extremity edema. He has smoked about two packs of cigarettes per day
since age 15 years. He does not drink alcohol. A few months ago, the patient
went to an urgent care clinic for evaluation of his symptoms, and he received a
prescription for some inhalers, the names of which he does not remember. He
was also told to find a primary care physician for further evaluation. On physical
examination, his blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg, heart rate 96 bpm, respiratory
rate 28 breaths per minute, and temperature 97.6°F. He is sitting in a chair,
leaning forward, with his arms braced on his knees. He appears uncomfortable
with labored respirations and cyanotic lips. He is using accessory muscles of
respiration, and chest examination reveals wheezes and rhonchi bilaterally, but
no crackles are noted. The anteroposterior diameter of the chest wall appears
increased, and he has inward movement of the lower rib cage with inspiration.
Cardiovascular examination reveals distant heart sounds but with a regular rate
and rhythm, and his jugular venous pressure is normal. His extremities show no
cyanosis, edema, or clubbing.

ANSWERS TO CASE 34:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Summary: A 58-year-old smoker has noted worsening shortness of breath with minimal exercise and the onset of dyspnea at rest and difficulty reclining. He reports a
productive cough with yellowish-brown sputum every morning throughout the year.
He is sitting in a characteristic “tripod” position to facilitate use of accessory muscles
of respiration. He appears to have airway obstruction with respiratory distress, with
lower chest retractions, and bilateral wheezes and rhonchi. His perioral cyanosis suggests hypoxemia. The anteroposterior diameter of the chest wall appears increased,
suggesting hyperinflation. Cardiovascular examination reveals distant heart sounds
but no signs of significant cardiac disease.
• Most likely diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with
acute exacerbation
• Next diagnostic step: Arterial blood gas to assess oxygenation and acid-base
status
• Best initial treatment: Oxygen by nasal cannula, followed closely by bronchodilators, and steroids for inflammatory component

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the definition and etiologies of chronic bronchitis, COPD, and emphysema.
2. Be familiar with spirometry and flow-volume loops for diagnosis of obstructive
and restrictive lung diseases.
3. Be familiar with the treatment of chronic stable COPD, as well as management
of acute exacerbations, including the indications for ventilatory assistance.

Considerations
This 58-year-old long-time smoker likely has chronic obstructive lung disease. He
is now in respiratory distress with labored respirations, cyanosis, and wheezing. The
urgent issue is his current respiratory status. Rapid clinical assessment is critical in
case this patient is headed toward respiratory failure, perhaps necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. An arterial blood gas will quickly provide information regarding the adequacy of oxygenation status (PaO2) and ventilation (PaCO2).

APPROACH TO:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
DEFINITIONS
CHRONIC BRONCHITIS: Clinical diagnosis characterized by excessive secretion of bronchial mucus and productive cough for 3 months or more in at least
2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease that might account for this
symptom.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD): Chronic
airflow obstruction caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Usually is progressive, may be accompanied by airway hyperreactivity, and may be partially reversible.
Typically the forced expiratory volume in first second of expiration (FEV1) will be
less than 80% of expected, and some use a staging system of FEV1/FVC (forced vital
capacity): <0.7 (mild), 0.3 to 0.5 (moderate), and <0.3 (severe).
EMPHYSEMA: Pathologic diagnosis that denotes abnormal, permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, with destruction of their walls
and without obvious fibrosis.
SPIROMETRY: Method of evaluating respiratory flow volumes and flow rates to
assess pulmonary function.
FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC): Total volume of air expired after full inspiration. FVC is reduced in restrictive lung disease. Patients with obstructive lung
disease usually have normal FVC.
FEV1: Volume of air expired in the first second during maximal expiratory effort.
FEV1 is reduced in both obstructive lung disease (increased airway resistance) and
restrictive lung disease (low vital capacity).
FEV1/FVC: Percentage of the vital capacity that is expired during the first second
of maximal effort, reduced in obstructive lung disease.
RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE: Chronic pulmonary disorders characterized
by low lung volumes because of alterations of either the lung parenchyma (intrinsic),
or chest wall, pleura, or respiratory muscles (extrinsic). Typically the FVC and FEV1
are reduced, but the FEV1/FVC is normal. The diagnosis is best made by a reduced
total lung capacity (TLC).

CLINICAL APPROACH
The most common etiology for COPD is inhalation injury, specifically cigarette
smoking. Another important cause is α1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is hereditary.
Pulmonary disease may become evident by age 40 years and often occurs without
cough or smoking history. Therapy by replacement of α1-antitrypsin enzyme is available. Characteristically, patients with COPD present with progressively worsening
dyspnea (first on exertion, then with activity, then at rest). Patient may vary in
appearance from a “blue bloater” (chronic bronchitis, overweight, edematous,
cyanotic) to a “pink puffer” (emphysema, thin, ruddy cheeks).

Arterial blood gases (ABG) often are normal in the early phase of the disease;
however, in more advanced disease, there is evidence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia,
often with a chronic compensated respiratory acidosis as a consequence of CO2 retention. Such chronic stable patients may have a PaO2 near 50 mm Hg and a PaCO2 near
50 mm Hg, but a near-normal pH (the “50-50” club). During an acute exacerbation,
more severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia, or respiratory acidosis noted on ABG may be
an indication of impending respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support.
Spirometry is the most basic, inexpensive, widely valuable pulmonary function
test to diagnose pulmonary diseases (Figure 34–1). Spirometric tracings of forced
expiration (Figure 34–2) and flow-volume loops (Figure 34–3) help to identify the

type of lung disease (obstructive vs restrictive), as well as potential reversibility of
airflow obstruction. Restrictive lung diseases tend to have lower lung volumes
(decreased TLC and VC [vital capacity]), whereas obstructive diseases have larger
lung volumes (TLC normal or increased) with decreased expiratory flow rates
(reduced FEV1 to <80% expected, and FEV1/FVC <0.7). Specific parameters help
to classify the type and degree of lung dysfunction (Table 34–1). Reduced FEV1/FVC
with minimal response to bronchodilators is the hallmark of COPD.
Management of severe COPD exacerbations focuses simultaneously on relieving
airway obstruction and correcting life-threatening abnormalities of gas exchange.
Bronchodilators (beta-agonist and anticholinergic agents) are administered via
handheld nebulizers; high-dose systemic glucocorticoids accelerate the rate of
improvement in lung function among these patients; antibiotics should be given if
there is suspicion of a respiratory infection. Controlled oxygen administration with
nasal oxygen at low flows or oxygen with Venturi masks will correct hypoxemia without causing severe hypercapnia. Caution must be exercised in patients with chronic
respiratory insufficiency whose respiratory drive is dependent on “relative hypoxemia”;
these individuals may become apneic if excessive oxygen is administered.
Positive-pressure mask ventilation, such as continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) or biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP), offers an alternative to intubation and mechanical ventilation in the treatment of cooperative patients with
an acute exacerbation of COPD and severe hypercapnia. Signs of acute respiratory
failure include tachypnea (respiratory rate >40 breaths per minute), inability to

speak because of dyspnea, accessory muscle use with fatigue despite maximal
therapy, confusion, restlessness, agitation, lethargy, a rising PaCO2 level, and extreme
hypoxemia. Acute respiratory failure is generally treated with endotracheal intubation with ventilatory support to correct the gas-exchange disorders. Complications
of mechanical ventilation include difficulty in extubation, ventilator-associated
pneumonia, pneumothorax, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Long-term complications of COPD from hypoxemia can cause pulmonary
hypertension, secondary erythrocytosis, exercise limitation, and impaired mental
functioning. For patients with COPD who are stable, only smoking cessation, supplemental oxygen therapy for patients with chronic hypoxemia, and lung volume
reduction surgery in selected patients have been shown to alter the natural history of the disease, and provide any reduction in mortality. Patients with a resting
hypoxemia (PaO2 <55 mm Hg or SaO2 <88%) generally benefit from home oxygen
therapy, which must be utilized at least 18 h/d. Other therapies such as inhaled
bronchodilators (beta-agonists and/or anticholinergics) or inhaled glucocorticoids
are used for symptomatic relief and to try to reduce the frequency of exacerbations.

A. Normal diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)
B. Decreased residual volume
C. Normal to slightly increased forced expiratory volume in first second
(FEV1)
D. Decreased forced expiratory volume in first second/forced vital capacity
(FEV1/FVC)
E. Decreased forced vital capacity (FVC)
34.4 Which of the following therapies is most likely to provide the greatest beneﬁt
to a patient with chronic stable emphysema and a resting oxygen saturation
of 86%?
A. Inhaled tiotropium daily
B. Inhaled albuterol as needed
C. Oral prednisone daily
D. Supplemental oxygen used at night
E. Supplemental oxygen used continuously

ANSWERS
34.1 A. COPD is characterized by chronic airway obstruction, with most airﬂow
resistance occurring in small airways of the lower respiratory tract, producing
expiratory wheezing. Inspiratory stridor would occur with upper airway, usually
extrathoracic, obstruction. Clubbing is not generally a feature of COPD and
should prompt investigation for another disease process such as a bronchogenic carcinoma. Crackles, elevated JVP, and an S3 are signs of congestive
heart failure.
34.2 C. Chest wall deformities can lead to chronic hypoventilation with elevated
PaCO2 levels, as well as with recurrent pulmonary infection. The pattern
on pulmonary function testing is usually that of a restrictive pattern, with
decreased total lung volumes and vital capacity, but with normal FEV1/FVC.

306

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

34.3 D. This patient likely has COPD, based on the smoking history and symptoms. A decrease in the forced expiratory volume in ﬁrst second/forced vital
capacity ratio is the hallmark of airﬂow obstruction. The FEV1 is decreased
in obstructive, as well as in restrictive, lung disease. The diffusing capacity is
typically deceased in COPD as well as intrinsic restrictive lung disease. The
DLCO indicates the adequacy of the alveolar-capillary membrane; the residual
volume is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiratory
effort and is usually increased in COPD due to air trapping.
34.4 E. For patients with chronic hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen has a signiﬁcant
impact on mortality, with a greater beneﬁt with continuous usage, rather than
intermittent or nocturnal-only usage. Bronchodilators such as tiotropium and
albuterol improve symptoms and improve FEV1, but offer no mortality beneﬁt.
Chronic use of oral corticosteroids should be avoided because of unfavorable
side effects such as osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and gastrointestinal (GI)
side effects.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Patients with obstructive lung disease have trouble blowing air out
(reduced FEV1/FVC), whereas patients with restrictive lung disease have
trouble getting air into the lungs (reduced TLC).



The mainstay for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbations includes bronchodilators, oxygen, and glucocorticoids, as
well as antibiotics if infection is suspected.



Controlled supplemental oxygen along with positive-pressure mask ventilation (biphasic positive airway pressure) may prevent respiratory failure
requiring intubation.



Smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen to treat chronic hypoxemia
are the only medical therapies shown to decrease mortality among persons
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.



The hallmark of restrictive lung disease is decreased lung capacities,
particularly the TLC but also the VC.



Whereas in both obstructive and restrictive lung disease, the FEV1 is
decreased, the FEV1/FVC is decreased in obstructive processes and normal
in restrictive processes.

CASE 35
A 37-year-old man presents to your office with the complaint of cough. The cough
began approximately 3 months prior to this appointment, and it has become more
annoying to the patient. The cough is nonproductive and worse at night and after
exercise. He has had a sedentary lifestyle but recently started an exercise program,
including jogging, and says he is having a much harder time with the exertion. He
just runs out of breath earlier than he used to previously, and he coughs a great
deal. He has not had any fever, blood-tinged sputum, or weight loss. He denies
nasal congestion and headaches. He does not smoke and has no significant medical
history. His examination is notable for a blood pressure of 134/78 mm Hg and
lungs that are clear to auscultation bilaterally, except for an occasional expiratory
wheeze on forced expiration. A chest radiograph is read as normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 35:
Chronic Cough/Asthma
Summary: A 37-year-old nonsmoking man complains of a 3-month history of a nonproductive cough that is worse at night and with exercise. He does not have fevers or
other symptoms to suggest infection. He is normotensive, and his lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally, except for an occasional expiratory wheeze on forced expiration. A chest radiograph is read as normal.
• Most likely diagnosis: Reactive airway disease (asthma)
• Confirmation of diagnosis: Pulmonary function tests, with methacholine challenge if indicated

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the differential diagnosis of chronic cough in adult patients.
2. Understand the stepwise approach to finding the cause of cough in these patients.
3. Learn how to diagnose and treat reactive airway disease (asthma).

Considerations
This is a 37-year-old man who presents with a chronic cough of more than 8 weeks’
duration. With the history of exercise intolerance, worsening cough at night, and
occasional wheezes on examination, asthma is the most likely diagnosis in this
patient. A chest radiograph is important to evaluate for more serious processes such
as tumor, infection, or parenchymal abnormality. A focused history should look for
exposure to environmental irritants, medications such as angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or possible underlying disorders such as postnasal drip or
gastroesophageal reflux.

APPROACH TO:
Chronic Cough
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE COUGH: Condition for less than 3 weeks, most commonly caused by
acute upper respiratory infection but also may be caused by congestive heart failure,
pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism.
ASTHMA: Condition of bronchial hyperactivity and smooth muscle hypertrophy
leading to a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways associated with widespread bronchospasm that is reversible.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

311

CHRONIC COUGH: Condition for longer than 3 to 8 weeks (case definitions
vary), which in a smoker may be suspicious for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchogenic carcinoma; in a nonsmoker with a normal chest
radiograph and not taking an ACE inhibitor, it may be due to postnasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or asthma.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Chronic cough represents a common complaint and a large portion of health-care
dollars. Physiologically, cough serves two main functions: (1) to protect the lungs
against aspiration and (2) to clear secretions or other material into more proximal
airways to be expectorated from the tracheobronchial tree. Patients with hemoptysis, immunocompromised states, comorbidities such as COPD or cystic fibrosis, current or previous infections such as tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), and significant symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and chills are
beyond the scope of this discussion.
Evaluation of chronic cough begins with a detailed history and physical examination, including smoking habits, complete medication list, environmental and
occupational exposures, and any history of asthma or obstructive lung disease.
Specific questions regarding the precipitating factors, duration, character, and
development of the cough should be elicited. Although the physical examination
or nature of the cough rarely identifies the cause, meticulous review of the ears,
nose, throat, and lungs may suggest a particular diagnosis. For example, a cobblestone appearance of the oropharynx (representing lymphoid hyperplasia) or boggy
erythematous nasal mucosa can be consistent with postnasal drip. End-expiratory
wheezing suggests active bronchospasm, whereas localized wheezing may be
consistent with a foreign body or a bronchogenic tumor.
In more than 90% of cases, a negative chest radiograph in an immunocompetent nonsmoker guides the physician to one of three diagnoses: postnasal drip,
asthma, or GERD. In the outpatient setting, the mainstay of diagnosis relates to
the response with empiric therapy, and multiple etiologies are addressed in terms
of treatment. Often, a definitive diagnosis for chronic cough depends on observing
a successful response to therapy. A rational approach includes stopping an ACE
inhibitor if present, chest radiograph, and avoiding irritants. If persistent, then three
conditions—postnasal drip, asthma, and GERD—should be considered. Referral to
a pulmonologist is recommended when the diagnostic and empiric therapy options
are exhausted. If suspicion for carcinoma is high, a high-resolution computed
tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax or bronchoscopy should be actively pursued.
A diagnosis of psychogenic cough should be one of exclusion. See Figure 35–1 for
example of an algorithm.

Postnasal Drip
Postnasal drip syndrome can be attributed to sinusitis and the following types of
rhinitis, alone or in combination: nonallergic, allergic, postinfectious, vasomotor,
drug induced, and environmental irritant induced. Because the symptoms may be
nonspecific (eg, frequent throat clearing, nasal discharge, or sensation of liquid in
the throat), no definitive diagnostic criteria exist for postnasal drip, and response

to therapy confirms the diagnosis. Initial treatment for a nonallergic etiology usually
includes combination treatment with a first-generation antihistamine and a decongestant for 3 weeks. For allergic rhinitis, a newer-generation antihistamine, along
with a nasal corticosteroid, should be used. If the patient’s symptoms do not improve,
sinus radiographs may be ordered. Opacification, air-fluid levels, or mucosal thickening could suggest sinusitis, which should be treated with antibiotics.

Asthma
Although wheezing is considered a classic sign of reactive airway disease, cough is
often the only symptom. Cough-variant asthma usually presents with a dry cough that
occurs throughout the day and night that is worsened by airway inflammation from
viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, allergies, cold air, or exercise. Although
the history may be suggestive of asthma, the diagnosis should be confirmed with
pulmonary function tests. Spirometry can confirm airflow obstruction with reduced
FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, as well as reversibility with increased FEV1 after inhalation
of beta-agonist. If the diagnosis is in doubt, airway hyperresponsiveness (the fundamental pathophysiologic abnormality in asthma) can be confirmed by reduced FEV1
after challenge with methacholine or histamine. A positive methacholine challenge
is generally defined as reversible obstruction with an increase in FEV1 of more than
or equal to 12% after bronchodilator treatment. Management of asthma should be
aimed at bronchodilators for rapid relief of symptoms, and asthma controllers, which
inhibit airway inflammation. Initial empiric treatment usually includes inhaled bronchodilators for intermittent bronchospasm as well as inhaled or oral corticosteroids
to reduce airway inflammation. Therapy is initiated in a stepwise approach, based on
frequency and severity of symptoms (Table 35–1).

Gastroesophageal Reﬂux Disease
Gastroesophageal reflux disease often can be clinically inapparent, and it may be
the primary or coexisting cause of the cough, often as a result of aspiration and vagal
stimulation. Initial treatment includes lifestyle modification along with medical
therapy. Recommendations include a low-fat diet, elevation of the head of the bed,
avoidance of offending foods (caffeine, alcohol, chocolate), smoking cessation, and
weight reduction. If the cough does not resolve with lifestyle changes, daily treatment with an H2 receptor antagonist such as famotidine, or a proton pump inhibitor
such as omeprazole, should be initiated. If acid suppression does not resolve the
symptoms, a gastric motility stimulant such as metoclopramide can be added.
Patients who remain symptomatic after maximal medical treatment often benefit
from 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring to confirm the diagnosis. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing esophagitis or an upper gastrointestinal radiographic
series demonstrating reflux further supports the diagnosis. Of note, gastrointestinal symptoms may resolve prior to resolution of the cough, and full resolution may
require 2 to 3 months of intensive medical therapy.

35.2 Which of the following is most accurate?
A. Cough caused by captopril may resolve with switching to enalapril.
B. Initial treatment of a chronic cough should include codeine or a similar
opiate derivative to suppress the cough.
C. Cough caused by reflux can be effectively ruled out by a negative history
of heartburn or dyspepsia.
D. More than one condition often is responsible for causing a chronic cough
in a given patient.
35.3 A 22-year-old African American woman presents with fatigue, arthralgias,
and a nagging dry cough for the past 6 weeks, but no shortness of breath. On
physical examination, her lungs are clear to auscultation, and she has bilateral
pretibial tender erythematous raised nodules. Which of the following is your
best next step?
A. Chest radiograph
B. High-resolution CT
C. Empiric treatment for postnasal drip
D. Antinuclear antibody
E. Initiation of antituberculosis therapy
35.4 An obese 50-year-old man with a history of asthma returns with complaints of
occasional dyspepsia and nocturnal cough. He wakes up in the morning with a
sour taste in his mouth. His current medications include inhaled corticosteroid
and a short-acting β2-agonist. Which of the following should be your next step?
A. 24-Hour esophageal pH monitoring
B. Chest radiograph
C. Initiation of omeprazole
D. Short course of oral corticosteroids
E. Initiation of allergy desensitization

ANSWERS
35.1 C. Long-acting β2-agonists are helpful in this situation. The asthma would
be classiﬁed as moderate persistent, and the recommended treatment is longacting β2-agonists, such as salmeterol, which are particularly helpful with nocturnal symptoms.
35.2 D. Often more than one condition is responsible for causing a chronic cough in
a given patient. Cough from ACE inhibitors is class dependent, and change to
another class of antihypertensives is more appropriate. The etiology of chronic
cough should be determined prior to suppression of the cough because treatment of the underlying condition is the most effective approach. The GERD
may present with the sole manifestation of cough, or it may present “silently.”

316

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

35.3 A. The patient has clinical features suggestive of sarcoidosis given the new
cough, arthralgias, and description of erythema nodosum. The initial, most
cost-effective study is a chest radiograph. Hilar lymphadenopathy with or
without interstitial inﬁltrates would solidify a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. A highresolution CT may be ordered if the patient has interstitial lung disease, but
it is not the ﬁrst study of choice. Postnasal drip does not explain the patient’s
other symptoms. An antinuclear antibody would not necessarily identify the
cause of the cough or provide a diagnosis.
35.4 C. The dyspepsia and the sour taste suggest GERD. Aside from acid suppression, other recommendations include dietary modiﬁcations and weight
reduction. Twenty-four–hour esophageal pH monitoring is indicated only if
the medication does not help.

CLINICAL PEARLS


A normal chest radiograph excludes most, but not all, of the serious and
uncommon causes of chronic cough.



The three most common causes of chronic cough in immunocompetent nonsmokers who are not taking ACE inhibitors are postnasal drip,
asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.



Cough caused by ACE inhibitors can be triggered after the first dose or
may occur after months of therapy.



Treatment of asthma is a stepwise process based on frequency of symptoms and response to prescribed medications.



Asthma can be the cause of cough in a patient with normal examination
and pulmonary function tests. If suspicion is high, a positive methacholine challenge has a high predictive value.



Definitive diagnosis of the etiology of chronic cough is not always necessary for successful treatment.

CASE 36
A 63-year-old African American woman is brought to the emergency room for
upper arm pain and swelling following a fall at home. The family has noted that for
approximately the past 2 months, the patient has become progressively fatigued
and absentminded, and she has developed loss of appetite and weight loss. She has
been getting up to urinate several times per night and complains of thirst; however,
a test for diabetes in her doctor’s office was negative. This morning, she lost her
balance because she felt “lightheaded” and fell, landing on her left arm. Physical
examination is notable for an elderly, thin woman in mild distress as a result of pain.
She is afebrile, and her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and heart rate 80 bpm.
Her thyroid gland is normal to palpation. Her mucous membranes are somewhat
dry and sticky. Heart and lung examinations are normal, and carotid auscultation
reveals no bruits. Examination of her extremities is significant only for deformity of
the left mid-humerus with swelling. The left radial pulse is 2+ and symmetric. The
radiologist calls you to confirm the fracture of the mid-left humerus but also states
that there is the suggestion of some lytic lesions of the proximal humerus and recommends a skull film (see Figure 36–1). Serum creatinine level is 2.1 mg/dL, with
normal electrolyte and glucose concentrations, but serum calcium level is 13 mg/dL
and hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL.

x-ray, she also has lytic lesions of the proximal humerus. She has renal insufficiency,
anemia, and hypercalcemia.
• Most likely diagnosis: Hypercalcemia with pathologic fracture of the left
humerus.
• Most likely underlying etiology: Multiple myeloma.
• Next therapeutic step: Initial therapy of the hypercalcemia with intravenous
(IV) fluids could be started in the emergency room.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia.
2. Know the treatment of symptomatic hypercalcemia.

Considerations
The patient presents with acute confusion, fatigue, and lethargy, all symptoms of
hypercalcemia, consistent with the calcium level of 13 mg/dL. The first step in
therapy should be intravenous saline to restore volume status and facilitate urinary
calcium excretion. Given the rapidity of onset of symptoms, weight loss, age, and
presence of lytic bone lesions, the first concern should be for malignancy, such as
multiple myeloma, or bony metastases from an undiagnosed cancer. Both serum and
urine electrophoresis would help to identify the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy. Normal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related
protein (PTHrP) levels would exclude other causes of hypercalcemia (diagnostic
algorithm is given in Figure 36–2 and causes of hypercalcemia in Table 36–1). Treatment then can be aimed at the underlying cause (Table 36–2).

APPROACH TO:
Hypercalcemia
DEFINITIONS
CORRECTED CALCIUM LEVEL: Add 0.8 mg/dL to the serum total calcium
for every 1 g/dL of albumin level below 4 g/dL. Example: If the serum calcium
level is 9.0 mg/dL and the albumin level is 2.0 g/dL, the corrected calcium level
is 10.6 mg/dL.
HYPERCALCEMIA: Elevated serum calcium levels after correction for albumin
concentration (normal range approximately 8.8-10.4 mg/dL).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hypercalcemia
The most common causes of hypercalcemia include malignancies or hyperparathyroidism, accounting for 90% of cases. Other causes include granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis and tuberculosis; less commonly, hypercalcemia
may be the presentation of intoxication with vitamin A, vitamin D, or calciumcontaining antacids, or may occur as a side effect of therapies with drugs such as
lithium or thiazide diuretics. Genetic conditions such as familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism as part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia
syndrome are less common causes.
The differential diagnosis can be narrowed based on the chronicity of the
patient’s presentation and the presence or absence of other symptoms and signs.
Primary hyperparathyroidism, usually caused by a solitary parathyroid adenoma,
is the most likely cause when hypercalcemia is discovered in an otherwise asymptomatic patient on routine laboratory screening. Most patients have no symptoms
with mild hypercalcemia less than 12 g/dL, except perhaps some polyuria and dehydration. With levels more than 13 mg/dL, patients begin developing increasingly

322

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

severe symptoms, including central nervous system (CNS) symptoms (lethargy,
stupor, coma, mental status changes, psychosis), gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia,
nausea, constipation, peptic ulcer disease), kidney problems (polyuria, nephrolithiasis,
prerenal azotemia), and musculoskeletal complaints (arthralgias, myalgias, weakness).
The symptoms of hyperparathyroidism can be remembered as stones (kidney),
moans (abdominal pain), groans (myalgias), bones (bone pain), and psychiatric
overtones (mental status changes). Diagnosis can be established by finding hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and inappropriately elevated PTH levels. Patients may
be treated surgically with parathyroidectomy if the hypercalcemia is greater than
1 mg/dL above upper limit of normal, or if less than 50 years old and significantly
decreased bone mineral density.
However, a patient presenting with acute onset of symptomatic hypercalcemia
is more likely to have a malignancy. Multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia
all can present with hypercalcemia, as can solid tumors such as breast, lung, and
kidney cancers. Some of these cancers cause elevated calcium levels by stimulating
osteoclast activity through direct bone marrow invasion (multiple myeloma, leukemia,
and breast cancer). Others produce excess 1,25-vitamin D (lymphomas), whereas
still others secrete a parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) that binds the
PTH receptor (kidney and lung). Cancer-related hypercalcemia can be differentiated
from primary hyperparathyroidism by a suppressed PTH level.
Electrolytes to assess acid-base status and renal function are important tests to
consider. A normal complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral smear would make
leukemia a less likely cause. Levels of PTH and specific assays for PTHrP are generally measured. If multiple myeloma is suspected, serum and urine electrophoresis
for monoclonal antibody spikes should be examined. Radiographs showing lytic or
blastic lesions may be helpful; finally, a bone marrow biopsy may be considered.

Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells that usually produce
monoclonal immunoglobulins. Patients typically present with lytic bone lesions,
hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and an elevated globulin fraction on
serum chemistries, which, if separated by electrophoresis, shows a monoclonal proliferation (M-spike). The diagnosis of multiple myeloma requires laboratory and
clinical criteria: a monoclonal antibody spike in the serum, or light chains in the
urine, and more than 10% clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, and lytic bone
lesions.
Patients with lower level monoclonal IgA or IgG antibody production without the signs or symptoms of multiple myeloma have what is termed a monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is much more common
than myeloma, affecting up to 1% of the population more than 50 years of age.
Long-term studies demonstrate that approximately 16% of these patients will go
on to develop multiple myeloma. Patients with MGUS typically require no therapy.
Some patients with myeloma with no bone lesions or other end-organ damage
have an indolent course (“smoldering myeloma”) and can be observed without
treatment for many years. Therapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma includes a
high-dose pulsed dexamethasone, often in combination with chemotherapy with

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

vincristine/doxorubicin or thalidomide. Some patients may be candidates for
autologous stem cell transplant.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
36.1 On routine blood work performed for a life insurance application, a
48-year-old premenopausal woman was found to have a calcium level of
12 mg/dL (normal = 8.8-10.4 mg/dL) and a phosphate level of 2 mg/dL
(normal = 3.0-4.5 mg/dL). She is not anemic and has no symptoms. Her
medical history is signiﬁcant for osteoporosis, discovered on a dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan performed last year. Which of the following
is the most likely cause of her hypercalcemia?
A. Multiple myeloma
B. Parathyroid adenoma
C. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
D. Sarcoidosis
E. Undiagnosed breast cancer
36.2 A 62-year-old asymptomatic woman is noted to have multiple myeloma and
hypercalcemia, but no bone lesions or end-organ damage. Which of the following therapies is useful for immediate treatment of the hypercalcemia?
A.
B.
C.
D.
E.

Bisphosphonates.
Erythropoietin.
Dexamethasone plus thalidomide.
Interferon-α.
Observe without treatment since she is asymptomatic.

36.3 A 22-year-old African American woman presents with worsening cough and
shortness of breath over 6 weeks, which did not improve with a course of antibiotics or antitussives. Her serum calcium level is found to be 12.5 mg/dL, and a
chest x-ray reveals bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. She has erythema nodosum
on her legs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sarcoidosis
B. Mycoplasma pneumonia
C. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
D. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
E. Pulmonary embolism

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

36.4 A 66-year-old man with known metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the
esophagus is brought to the emergency room for increasing lethargy and confusion. He is clinically dehydrated, his serum calcium level is 14 mg/dL, and his
creatinine level is 2.5 mg/dL but 1 month ago was 0.9 mg/dL. Which therapy
for his hypercalcemia should be instituted ﬁrst?
A. Intravenous bisphosphonate
B.
C.
D.
E.

Intravenous furosemide
Glucocorticoids
Intravenous normal saline
Chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma

ANSWERS
36.1 B. An asymptomatic, most likely chronically elevated calcium level is most
likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma.
The hypercalcemia is presumed to be chronic because she has osteoporosis
and is premenopausal.
36.2 A. Bisphosphonates are helpful in controlling hypercalcemia through inhibition of osteoclastic bone reabsorption. Dexamethasone, in combination with
thalidomide, is useful in treatment of the myeloma, with a slower effect on the
calcium level.
36.3 A. Both sarcoidosis and lymphoma can present with cough, dyspnea, and hilar
adenopathy on chest x-ray. In approximately 10% of cases, sarcoidosis can
cause elevated calcium levels through the production of 1,25-vitamin D that
occurs in the macrophages of the granulomas. This can also be seen in granulomas caused by tuberculosis and in lymphoma. Leukemia usually does not
present in this manner, although it can cause hypercalcemia. Squamous cell
carcinoma of the lung would be unusual in a patient of this age, and the radiographic presentation is atypical.
36.4 D. Although all of the other therapies listed may be helpful in the treatment of
hypercalcemia, given the clinical ﬁndings of dehydration and elevated creatinine level with a history of previously normal renal function, volume expansion with normal saline would correct the dehydration and presumed prerenal
azotemia, allowing the kidneys to more efﬁciently excrete calcium. Other
therapies can be added if the response to normal saline alone is insufﬁcient.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Hypercalcemia that is acutely symptomatic is most likely caused by
cancer. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is most likely caused by primary
hyperparathyroidism.



In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum parathyroid hormone and calcium
levels are elevated, and phosphate levels are decreased. In malignancyrelated hypercalcemia, the calcium level is high and parathyroid hormone
levels are suppressed.



Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism can be remembered as “stones,
moans, groans, bones, and psychiatric overtones.”



Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and
symptomatic multiple myeloma are on opposite ends of a spectrum of
neoplastic disease of plasma cells.



The classic triad of multiple myeloma consists of bone pain due to lytic
lesions, anemia, and renal insufficiency.

CASE 37
A 48-year-old woman calls 911 and is brought to the emergency room complaining
of a sudden onset of dyspnea. She reports she was standing in the kitchen
making dinner, when she suddenly felt as if she could not get enough air, her
heart started racing, and she became lightheaded and felt as if she would faint.
She denied chest pain or cough. Her medical history is significant only for gallstones, for which she underwent a cholecystectomy 2 weeks previously. The procedure was complicated by a wound infection, requiring her to stay in the hospital
for 8 days. She takes no medications regularly, and only takes acetaminophen as
needed for pain at her abdominal incision site.
On examination, she is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute,
oxygen saturations 84% on room air, heart rate 124 bpm, and blood pressure
118/89 mm Hg. She appears uncomfortable, diaphoretic, and frightened. Her oral
mucosa is slightly cyanotic, her jugular venous pressure is elevated, and her chest
is clear to auscultation. Her heart rhythm is tachycardic but regular with a loud
second sound in the pulmonic area, but no gallop or murmur. Her abdominal
examination is benign, with a clean incision site without signs of infection. Her
right leg is moderately swollen from mid-thigh to her feet, and her thigh and calf
are mildly tender to palpation. Laboratory studies including cardiac enzymes are
normal; her electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals only sinus tachycardia, and her chest
x-ray is interpreted as normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 37:
Pulmonary Embolism
Summary: A 48-year-old woman is brought to the hospital for very acute onset of
dyspnea and is found to be tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypoxemic. On physical
examination, she has elevated jugular venous pressure and a loud pulmonic closure
sound, perhaps signifying acutely elevated pulmonary pressures. All of these findings, especially the hypoxemia despite a clear chest radiograph, strongly suggest a
pulmonary embolism (PE), most likely caused by a lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis (DVT), a late complication of her recent hospitalization and relative
immobilization.
• Most likely diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism
• Most appropriate diagnostic step: Chest computed tomography (CT) with
intravenous contrast, or other imaging study as indicated

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the factors that predispose patients to develop thromboembolic disease.
2. Recognize the clinical presentation of PE.
3. Know the strategies to diagnose PE.
4. Understand the goals and methods of treatment of thromboembolism.

Considerations
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a difficult diagnosis to establish because of the nonspecificity of presenting signs and symptoms and the probabilistic nature of the most
common noninvasive diagnostic tests. In patients with suspected PE, initial treatment is supportive to maintain adequate oxygenation and hemodynamic stability,
and efforts are undertaken to try to diagnose the PE or other cause of the patient’s
symptoms. Often, a series of diagnostic tests is necessary to determine the likely
diagnosis. Specific treatment of PE may include thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy for unstable patients and initiation of anticoagulation as a long-term measure
to prevent recurrence.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Pulmonary Embolism
DEFINITION
DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT): Blood clot in the deep venous system
that usually affects the lower extremities or pelvic veins.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

329

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology and Risk Factors
Diagnosis and management of PE require a combination of clinical suspicion and
appropriate use of diagnostic tools. Pulmonary emboli usually arise from deep venous
thrombi and occasionally from less common sources, including air, fat, amniotic
fluid, or tumor thrombus. More than 100 years ago, Rudolf Virchow postulated three
factors that predispose to venous thrombus: local trauma to vessel wall, a state of
hypercoagulability, and venous stasis. Genetic predisposition to hypercoagulability
accounts for approximately 20% of PEs. The most common inherited conditions are
the factor V Leiden mutation and the prothrombin gene mutations. Malignancy is
also a predisposing condition for deep venous thrombosis. These neoplastic cells are
thought to generate thrombin or to synthesize various procoagulants. Surgery and
immobilization also increase the risk of PE as late as 1 month postoperatively.

Pathophysiology
When venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they may embolize to
the pulmonary arteries causing PE. The deep proximal lower-extremity veins are
the most common sites of clot formation, although thromboses in pelvic, calf,
and upper-extremity veins may also embolize. Obstruction to the pulmonary artery
causes platelets to release vasoactive agents such as serotonin, thereby elevating
pulmonary vascular resistance. The resulting increase in alveolar dead space and
subsequent redistribution of blood flow create areas of V/Q mismatch and impair
gas exchange. Reflex bronchoconstriction causes increasing airway resistance. This
cascade can result in pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or loss of surfactant, further
decreasing lung compliance. As pulmonary vascular resistance increases, rightheart wall tension rises, resulting in dilation and dysfunction that ultimately may
impair left heart function. Progressive right heart failure is the usual cause of
death from PE.

Clinical and Nonimaging Evaluation
Pulmonary embolism (PE) can often mimic other cardiopulmonary diseases, making
the diagnosis challenging. Acute onset of dyspnea is the most common symptom
of PE, and tachypnea is the most frequently observed sign. Severe dyspnea accompanied by syncope, hypotension, or cyanosis may indicate massive PE, whereas
pleuritic pain, cough, or hemoptysis may suggest a smaller more peripheral embolus
causing infarction of lung tissue. Classic findings on physical examination include
tachycardia and signs of right ventricular dysfunction, including bulging neck veins,
left parasternal lift, accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound,
and systolic murmur that increases with inspiration. Findings suggestive of DVT
include pain, swelling, and erythema to the lower extremity, particularly the back of
the leg below the knee. Some patients complain of calf tenderness.
The most useful nonimaging diagnostic test is the serum D-dimer enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). It is elevated (>500 ng/mL) in more than 95% of
patients with PE, reflecting the breakdown of fibrin and thrombolysis. Although the
D-dimer ELISA has a high negative predictive value and thus is useful in excluding

330

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

PE, it lacks specificity. Elevations may be seen in patients with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, heart failure, cancer, or sepsis. Abnormalities on the ECG are less
useful in the evaluation of PE. The most common finding is sinus tachycardia. The
S1Q3T3 (S wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III)
is often discussed but less commonly seen, but when present, is relatively specific.

Imaging Modalities
Radiologic studies are critical in the diagnosis of PE and DVT. A chest x-ray is the
first study indicated in a symptomatic patient with new-onset dyspnea. A normal or
near-normal chest x-ray is the most common finding in PE, sometimes with nonspecific abnormalities, such as atelectasis. In general, acute onset of hypoxemia in
a patient with a normal chest x-ray should be interpreted as PE until otherwise
proven. Classic abnormalities associated with PE include Westermark sign (nonspecific
prominence of the central pulmonary artery with decreased pulmonary vascularity),
Hampton hump (peripheral wedge-shaped density above the diaphragm), and Palla
sign (enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery). The chest radiograph
probably is more important in identifying other significant pulmonary parenchymal
disease (pneumonia, pulmonary edema) and cardiac disease (cardiomyopathy) as the
cause of the respiratory symptoms.
For any imaging modality, the most accurate diagnosis will be achieved in combination with the clinical suspicion. The Wells score is a useful clinical calculator to
clinically estimate pretest probability of PE. A point score less than 4 with a negative
D-dimer assay indicates a low probability for PE. A score of 2 to 6 points indicates
moderate probability, and more than 6 points is high probability. (See Table 37–1.)
Chest CT with intravenous contrast is now the principal imaging modality to
diagnose suspected pulmonary embolism. Current generation spiral CT can acquire
high-resolution images in a single breath hold, and can visualize small branch artery
emboli. In addition, the chest CT has the additional benefit of visualizing other
abnormalities such as pneumonia, aortic abnormalities, or pulmonary masses that

may not have been apparent on routine chest radiograph, and which may provide
an alternative diagnosis for the patient’s symptomatology. The main caveats in the
use of CT are the image quality and the experience of the center in interpreting
this type of scan. In general, however, CT has been shown to be at least as accurate
as the previously accepted standard imaging modality, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q)
lung scanning.
In patients in whom a CT with radiocontrast cannot be obtained or is contraindicated (advanced renal insufficiency, severe contrast allergy), a V/Q scan remains
a useful tool. A normal scan or a low-probability scan with a low clinical suspicion
for PE effectively excludes the diagnosis.
If the CT and/or V/Q scan are nondiagnostic, yet the clinical suspicion remains
high, other imaging modalities may be obtained. A lower extremity venous ultrasound demonstrating an acute DVT in a patient with signs and symptoms of PE
would be sufficient to diagnose and treat PE (especially since the treatment with
anticoagulation is the same). It should be noted, though, that a normal ultrasound
does not exclude the diagnosis of PE, since most patients with PE do not have evidence of residual DVT, and in many cases because the clot has already embolized.
Other imaging studies such as contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) or echocardiography (especially transesophageal echocardiography) may
be used when the clinical suspicion remains high, but other diagnostic studies are
inconclusive. Figure 37–1 gives a diagnostic algorithm for suspected PE.

or thrombolysis or removal of clot by surgical embolectomy and usually is reserved
for patients with a high risk for adverse outcomes if the clot remains, that is, those
with right heart failure or hypotension.
For patients who are normotensive with normal right ventricle (RV) function,
treatment is with anticoagulation, with the goal of secondary prevention of thrombus
extension or recurrence. Anticoagulation does not dissolve existing thrombus, but
allows for endothelialization and organization, which begins within days of treatment.
Immediate anticoagulation should be initiated with intravenous unfractionated
heparin (UFH), subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin
or tinzaparin, or the direct factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux. While UFH requires a
continuous infusion and frequent laboratory monitoring every 4 to 6 hours, LMWH
and fondaparinux provide rapid onset of action and predictable dose response, and
no laboratory monitoring is generally required.
Patients can then be started on the oral vitamin K antagonist warfarin. It may
cause an initial paradoxical prothrombotic state, and thus requires overlap with
UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux when beginning therapy. Because its biologic effect
is unpredictable, warfarin requires routine monitoring of the prothrombin time,
standardized across laboratories as the international normalized ratio (INR). The
target therapeutic INR is usually 2.5. When initiating warfarin therapy, the usual
course is to use UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least 5 days while overlapping
with warfarin until the INR has been therapeutic for 2 consecutive days. The duration of treatment relates to the risk of recurrence. One factor in assessing this risk
is whether the DVT or PE was provoked (ie, occurred due to a readily identifiable
and transient event such as trauma or surgery) or unprovoked. For provoked DVT
of the calf or upper extremity, 3 months of anticoagulation are recommended. Six
months are recommended for patients with provoked proximal leg DVT or PE. For
patients with idiopathic or unprovoked DVT or PE, or with ongoing risk factors,
such as malignancy or antiphospholipid syndrome, the duration of therapy is controversial, but indefinite anticoagulation may be required.
Inferior vena cava filter placement to prevent recurrent PE is recommended
when there is active bleeding or other contraindication to anticoagulation, or recurrent DVT or PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation.

37.3 A 54-year-old woman is noted to have cervical cancer and presents with signiﬁcant vaginal bleeding with a hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL. Her left leg is
swollen, which on Doppler investigation reveals a deep venous thrombosis.
Which of the following is the best treatment for the thrombus?
A. Intravenous unfractionated heparin
B. Fractionated subcutaneous heparin
C. Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin
D. Oral warfarin (Coumadin)
E. Vena cava filter

ANSWERS
37.1 C. Tachypnea is the most common physical sign associated with pulmonary
embolus.
37.2 C. Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common hereditary thrombophilia.
37.3 E. Cervical cancer with signiﬁcant vaginal bleeding is a relative contraindication for anticoagulation. Thus, a vena cava ﬁlter is the most appropriate choice
in this patient.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Acute onset of dyspnea or hypoxemia with a normal chest x-ray should be
considered a pulmonary embolism until proven otherwise.



Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is usually established using imaging
tests such as chest CT considered in the light of clinical pretest probability.



The primary therapy of DVT or PE is anticoagulation, with the goal of
preventing recurrence.

CASE 38
A 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after coughing up several
tablespoons of bright red blood. For the previous 3 to 4 months, she has had a
chronic nonproductive cough but no fevers. More recently, she has noticed some
scant blood-streaked sputum. On review of her symptoms, she reports increased
fatigue, decreased appetite, and a 25-lb weight loss in the past 3 months. She
denies chest pain, fever, chills, or night sweats. The patient has smoked one pack
of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years. She drinks two martinis every day and
has not had any significant medical illness. She worked in a library for 35 years
and has no history of occupational exposures. She does not take any medication
except for one aspirin per day.
The patient is a thin woman who is mildly anxious, alert, and oriented. Her
blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 88 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths
per minute, and temperature 99.2°F. Neck examination reveals no lymphadenopathy,
thyromegaly, or carotid bruit. The chest has scattered rhonchi bilaterally, but there
are no wheezes or crackles. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate
and rhythm, without rubs, gallops, or murmurs. The abdomen is benign with no
hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of her extremities reveals no cyanosis; there is
finger clubbing. Neurologic examination is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 38:
Hemoptysis, Lung Cancer
Summary: A 68-year-old female smoker has expectorated bright red blood. She has
had a chronic nonproductive cough and, more recently, some blood-streaked sputum.
She reports increased fatigability, reduced appetite, and unintentional weight loss. She
has no fever, chills, or night sweats to suggest infection. On examination, her chest
reveals scattered rhonchi bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. She has clubbing
of the fingers.
• Next step: Chest imaging, either x-ray or CT scan
• Most likely diagnosis: Lung cancer

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the differential diagnosis of hemoptysis.
2. Be familiar with the risk factors for and the clinical presentation of lung cancer
(including superior vena cava [SVC] syndrome and Horner syndrome).
3. Know the workup of the solitary pulmonary nodule.
4. Be familiar with the general principles of treatment of lung cancer.

Considerations
The most likely diagnosis in this case is lung cancer. On physical examination, there
was finger clubbing, an enlargement of the terminal digital phalanges with loss of
the nail bed angle. In pulmonary disease, clubbing of fingers is most commonly seen
in patients with lung cancer or with chronic septic conditions, such as bronchiectasis
or lung abscess. She will require imaging studies such as a chest x-ray and likely a
computed tomography (CT) of the chest, and if abnormalities are seen, a biopsy
procedure to establish a tissue diagnosis. In the meantime, she will benefit from
rest and cough suppression to minimize her hemoptysis, which may be acutely life
threatening, if massive bleeding occurs.

APPROACH TO:
Hemoptysis
DEFINITIONS
MASSIVE HEMOPTYSIS: More than 100 to 600 mL of blood loss that is coughed
up within a 24-hour period.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

337

HORNER SYNDROME: Symptoms are ptosis, loss of pupillary dilation (miosis),
and loss of sweating on the ipsilateral side (anhidrosis) caused by compression of the
superior cervical ganglion and resultant loss of sympathetic innervation.
SUPERIOR VENA CAVA (SVC) SYNDROME: Obstruction of venous drainage,
usually by external compression of the SVC, leading to edema of the face, neck, and
upper part of the torso often with formation of collateral veins on the upper chest.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hemoptysis is defined as an expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract. It is
an alarming symptom, both because it may be a manifestation of a serious underlying diagnosis, such as malignancy, and because massive hemoptysis can fill up
alveolar air spaces and cause asphyxiation. Hemoptysis, particularly if in large quantity or recurrent, is a potentially fatal event requiring an immediate search for the
cause and precise location of the bleeding. Hemoptysis must be differentiated from
hematemesis and from blood originating in the nasopharynx. Currently, the most
common causes of hemoptysis in the United States are bronchitis and lung
cancer. In prior eras, the most common causes have been tuberculosis, lung abscess,
and bronchiectasis. History is an important diagnostic step: blood-streaked purulent
sputum suggests bronchitis; chronic copious sputum production suggests bronchiectasis. Hemoptysis with an acute onset of pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea
suggests a pulmonary embolism. Every patient with hemoptysis should undergo a
chest x-ray or CT to look for a mass lesion, evidence of bronchiectasis, or parenchymal disease. If the chest imaging reveals a pulmonary mass, the patient should
undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy to localize the site of bleeding and to visualize
and attempt to biopsy any endobronchial lesion. Patients with massive hemoptysis
require measures to maintain their airway and to prevent spilling blood into unaffected areas of the lungs. These patients should be kept at rest with suppression of
cough. If the bleeding is localized to one lung, the affected side should be placed in a
dependent position so that bleeding does not flow into the contralateral side. They
may also require endotracheal intubation and rigid bronchoscopy for better airway
control and suction capacity.

Risk Factors for Lung Cancer
Primary lung cancer, or bronchogenic carcinoma, is the leading cause of cancer
deaths in both men and women. Approximately 85% of lung cancers of all cell types
are linked to smoking. Of the 15% of lung cancers that are not related to smoking,
the majority are found in women for reasons that are unknown. Thoracic radiation
exposure as well as exposure to environmental toxins such as asbestos or radon are
also associated with increased risk of developing lung cancer.

Clinical Presentation of Lung Cancer
Only 5% to 15% of patients with lung cancer are asymptomatic when diagnosed. In
these cases, a lung nodule usually is found incidentally on chest x-ray or CT.
Endobronchial tumors may present with cough or with hemoptysis. Chest pain is
also a possible symptom of lung cancer and suggests pleural involvement or neoplastic
invasion of the chest wall. Symptoms of weight loss, malaise, and fatigue usually

338

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

develop later in the disease course. Malignant pleural effusion is common. Horner
syndrome is caused by the invasion of the cervicothoracic sympathetic nerves and
occurs with apical tumors (Pancoast tumor). Phrenic nerve invasion may cause
diaphragmatic paralysis. SVC obstruction is produced by direct extension of the
tumor or by compression from the neighboring lymph nodes. SVC syndrome has a
dramatic clinical presentation and requires urgent care.
Once a patient presents with symptoms or radiographic findings suggestive of
lung cancer, the next steps are as follows:
1. Tissue diagnosis to establish malignant diagnosis and histologic type
2. Staging to determine resectability or curative potential
3. Cancer treatment: surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy

Lung Cancer Classiﬁcation
Histologically, primary lung cancer can be divided into two major categories with
important therapeutic implications: small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which comprise 95% of primary lung cancers. NSCLC is
further divided into three histologic types: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma,
and large cell carcinoma. NSCLC is three to four times more common than SCLC.
Squamous cell cancer usually does not metastasize early. It usually is a central/hilar
lesion with local extension that may present with symptoms caused by bronchial
obstruction, such as atelectasis and pneumonia. It may present on chest x-ray as a
cavitary lesion; squamous cell cancer is by far the most likely to cavitate. It may
also produce PTH (parathyroid hormone)-like hormone and present with hypercalcemia. Adenocarcinoma and large cell cancer are peripheral lesions. Adenocarcinoma metastasizes early, especially to the CNS, bones, and adrenal glands.
Adenocarcinoma has the least association with smoking and a stronger association with pulmonary scars/fibrosis. Large cell cancer usually is a peripheral lesion
and tends to metastasize to the CNS and mediastinum, causing SVC syndrome or
hoarseness as a consequence of laryngeal nerve paralysis.
Small cell cancer, previously called oat-cell, is made up of poorly differentiated cells of
neuroendocrine origin. It is extremely aggressive but is more likely to respond to chemotherapy than NSCLC. The primary lesion is usually central. Eighty percent of patients
have metastasis at the time of diagnosis, so its treatment usually is different from that
of other lung cancers. Contrary to other lung cancers, cavitation never occurs in small
cell cancer. SCLC can cause the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic
hormone (SIADH), ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, and
Eaton-Lambert syndrome. Table 38–1 lists typical characteristics of various cell types.
SCLC is initially very responsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but
unfortunately, most SCLC relapses. Additionally, SCLC has almost always spread
at time of diagnosis, so surgical treatment with curative intent is not possible. In
contrast, NSCLC is much less responsive to chemotherapy or to radiation, but
tumors that are localized at time of diagnosis may be treated curatively surgically,
or with radiation therapy. NSCLC includes several histologic subtypes—squamous
cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma—but they all have similar
prognoses at similar stages, and are treated similarly.

General Principles of Treatment
Treatment of lung cancer consists of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy in different combinations, depending on the tissue type and extent of
the disease, and may be performed with either curative or palliative intent.
SCLC is nearly always metastatic at time of diagnosis and, therefore, not eligible
for surgical resection. It is staged as either limited-stage disease, that is, disease
confined to one hemithorax that can be treated within a radiotherapy port, or
extensive-stage disease, that is, contralateral lung involvement or distant metastases.
Patients with untreated SCLC have a grim prognosis, with survival measured in weeks.
With treatment, survival can be prolonged, and approximately 20% to 30% of
patients with limited-stage disease can be cured with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
The prognosis for relapsed patients, though, is very poor.
Once the diagnosis of NSCLC is made, the next step is to stage the disease to
decide whether the cancer is resectable and, thus, potentially curable. In patients
with NSCLC, the following are major contraindications to potential curative
resection:
• Extrathoracic metastases
• Superior vena cava syndrome
• Vocal cord or phrenic nerve paralysis
• Malignant pleural effusion
• Cardiac tamponade
• Tumor within 2 cm of the carina
• Metastasis to the contralateral lung
• Metastases to supraclavicular lymph nodes or contralateral mediastinal node
• Involvement of the main pulmonary artery

340

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

If the cancer is deemed resectable, the next decision point is whether the patient
can withstand an operation. Because most lung cancer occurs in older patients who
have been smokers, they frequently have underlying cardiopulmonary disease
and require preoperative evaluation, including pulmonary function testing, to
predict whether they have sufficient pulmonary reserve to tolerate a lobectomy
or pneumonectomy.

Solitary Pulmonary Nodule
The solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as a nodule surrounded by normal
parenchyma. The large majority of incidentally discovered nodules are benign,
but differentiation between benign etiologies and early-stage malignancy can
be challenging. Proper management of a solitary nodule in an individual patient
depends on a variety of elements: age, risk factors, presence of calcifications, and
size of the nodule. Of these factors, size is highly predictive. Larger lesions are more
likely to be malignant than smaller lesions. In one study, the likelihood of malignancy was 0.2% for nodules smaller than 3 mm, 0.9% for nodules 4 to 7 mm, 18%
for nodules 8 to 20 mm, and 50% for nodules larger than 20 mm. Put another way,
greater than 99% of nodules measuring less than 8 mm are benign.
The presence and type of calcification on a solitary pulmonary nodule can be
helpful. “Popcorn” and “bull’s-eye” calcifications suggest a benign process, whereas
absence of calcification increases the likelihood of malignancy.
For lesions 8 mm or less, serial CT imaging is an acceptable strategy to monitor
for growth. Radiographic stability for 2 years or longer is strong evidence of benign
etiology. For lesions 1 cm or greater, additional studies such as positron emission
tomography (PET) scan or transthoracic needle biopsy or bronchoscopic evaluation
may be indicated.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
38.1 A 67-year-old long-time smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
presents with 3 days of headaches and plethoric swelling of his face and right
arm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Angioedema
B. Hypothyroidism
C. Superior vena cava syndrome
D. Trichinosis
38.2 A 64-year-old woman comes to your ofﬁce complaining of hoarse voice for
4 months. She has not had fever, sore throat, or a cough. On examination, she
has expiratory wheezes in her left mid-lung ﬁelds. Which of the following is
the best next step?
A. Prescribe antibiotics for bronchitis.
B. Order a chest x-ray.
C. Advise gargling with salt-water solution.
D. Prescribe an albuterol inhaler.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

341

38.3 A 33-year-old woman who is a nonsmoker has lost 30 lb and has a cough. She
is noted to have a lung mass on chest radiograph. Which of the following lung
cancers is the most likely cell type?
A. Squamous cell
B. Adenocarcinoma
C. Small cell
D. Large cell
38.4 A 52-year-old man presents with dyspnea, and chest x-ray shows a hilar mass
with ipsilateral pleural effusion. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. CT scan of the chest, head, and abdomen for cancer staging.
B. Pulmonary function testing to evaluate pulmonary reserve to evaluate for
pulmonectomy.
C. Obtain a specific tissue diagnosis by biopsy of the hilar mass.
D. Initiate palliative radiation because the patient is not a candidate for curative resection.

ANSWERS
38.1 C. The patient has features of SVC syndrome, caused by compression of the
SVC, almost always by a thoracic malignancy. Urgent diagnosis and treatment
are mandatory because of impaired cerebral venous drainage and resultant
increased intracranial pressure or possibly fatal intracranial venous thrombosis.
Angioedema, hypothyroidism, and trichinosis all may cause facial swelling,
but not the plethora or swelling of the arm.
38.2 B. This patient has chronic hoarseness and unilateral wheezing. This suggests
an intrathoracic mass causing bronchial obstruction and impairment of the
recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing vocal cord paralysis. Thus, an imaging study
of the chest is essential.
38.3 B. Ninety percent of patients with lung cancer of all histologic types have a
smoking history. The most common form of lung cancer found in nonsmokers,
young patients, and women is adenocarcinoma.
38.4 C. Tissue diagnosis is essential for proper treatment of any malignancy and
should always be the ﬁrst step. Once a speciﬁc tissue diagnosis is obtained,
the cancer is staged for prognosis and to guide therapy: is the cancer potentially resectable? Questions for this patient include the tissue type, location of
spread, and whether the pleural effusion is caused by malignancy.

Most patients with hemoptysis require evaluation with bronchoscopy.
Massive hemoptysis may result in death by asphyxiation.



Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women.



A solitary pulmonary nodule measuring 8 mm or less can be followed
radiographically. For larger lesions, a biopsy, whether bronchoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical, should be considered.



Steps in management of a patient with suspected lung cancer include
tissue diagnosis, staging, preoperative evaluation, and treatment with
surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.

Small cell lung cancer usually is metastatic at the time of diagnosis and
not resectable. Non–small cell lung cancer may be curable by resection if
it is early stage, and the patient has sufficient pulmonary reserve.

ANSWERS TO CASE 39:
Community-Acquired Pneumonia
Summary: A 44-year-old healthy man presents with sudden onset of shaking chills,
fever, and productive cough. He also complains of right-sided pleuritic chest pain.
He is febrile to 102°F, but not tachypneic, and is normotensive with good oxygenation. His physical examination is unremarkable except for bronchial breath sounds
and end-inspiratory crackles in the right lower lung field, and there is a right lower
lobe consolidation on chest x-ray.
• Most likely diagnosis: Community-acquired pneumonia.
• Next step: Oral antibiotic therapy, pain relievers, antipyretics, and cough
suppressants for relief of symptoms. Close outpatient follow-up (in 1-2 weeks).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the causative organisms in community-acquired pneumonia and the
appropriate therapeutic regimens.
2. Understand the clinical criteria indicating inpatient versus outpatient therapy.
3. Discuss the role of radiologic and laboratory evaluation in the diagnosis of
pneumonia.
4. Understand the difference between aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration
pneumonia.

Considerations
This previously healthy 44-year-old man has clinical and radiographic evidence of
a focal consolidation of the lungs, which is consistent with a bacterial process, such
as infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The specific causative organism is usually not definitively established, so you will need to initiate empiric antimicrobial
therapy and risk stratify the patient to determine whether he can safely be treated as
an outpatient or requires hospitalization.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Pneumonia
DEFINITIONS
PNEUMONIA: An infection of the lung parenchyma, which may be caused by
bacteria, viruses, fungi, or rarely protozoa.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

345

COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA (CAP): An infection of the
alveoli, distal airways, and interstitium of the lungs that occurs outside the hospital
setting, affecting individuals of all ages.
HEALTH-CARE–ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (HCAP): Pneumonia occurring in a nonhospitalized patient but with extensive health-care contact, including
one of the following: intravenous therapy, wound care, or intravenous chemotherapy within the prior 30 days, residence in a nursing home or other long-term
care facility, hospitalization in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within
the prior 90 days, or attendance at a hospital or hemodialysis clinic within the
prior 30 days.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma. Patients may present with any
of a combination of cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, sputum production, shortness
of breath, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. Certain clinical presentations are associated with particular infectious agents. For example, the “typical” pneumonia is often
described as having a sudden onset of fever, cough with productive sputum, often
associated with pleuritic chest pain, and possibly rust-colored sputum. This is the
classic description of pneumococcal pneumonia. The “atypical” pneumonia is characterized as having a more insidious onset, with a dry cough, prominent extrapulmonary symptoms such as headache, myalgias, sore throat, and a chest radiograph
that appears much worse than the auscultatory findings. This type of presentation
usually is attributed to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Although these characterizations
are of some diagnostic value, it is very difficult to reliably distinguish between typical and atypical organisms based on clinical history and physical examination as the
cause of a specific patient’s pneumonia. Therefore, pneumonias are typically classified according to the immune status of the host, the radiographic findings, and the
setting in which the infection was acquired, in an attempt to identify the most likely
causative organisms and to guide initial empiric therapy.
Community-acquired pneumonia, as opposed to nosocomial or hospital-acquired
pneumonia, is most commonly caused by S pneumoniae, M pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or respiratory viruses, such as influenza and
adenovirus. Despite careful history and physical and routine lab and radiographic
investigation, it is difficult to determine a specific pathogen in most cases. Epidemiology and risk factors may provide some clues: Chlamydia psittaci (bird exposure),
coccidiomycosis (travel to the American southwest), or histoplasmosis (endemic
to the Mississippi Valley) may be the cause. In a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or immunosuppression, Pneumocystis jirovecii should be
added to the differential diagnosis. Tuberculosis is a possibility in patients with a history suggestive of exposure or predisposition (eg, those with AIDS) to this disease.
Pathogens in health-care–associated pneumonia (HCAP) include methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.,
and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be
directed accordingly.
Once the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia has been made, the next step is to
try to risk stratify the patients, to decide which patients can be treated safely as

346

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

outpatients with oral antibiotics, and which require hospitalization. Two major risk
stratification tools are currently employed. The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)
uses 20 variables to identify patients at low risk for death. Those in the lowest two
classes have a predicted mortality less than 0.6% and are suitable for outpatient
treatment. The CURB-65 is a severity of illness score using 5 variables:
Confusion (1 point)
Urea greater than 20 mg/dL (1 point)
Respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/min (1 point)
Blood pressure, systolic less than 90 mm Hg (1 point)
Age greater than 65 years (1 point)
Patients with a score of 0 have a 30-day mortality of 1.5% and usually can be
safely treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics. With a score of 2, the mortality is
9.2%, and the patient should be admitted to the hospital.
Although outpatients usually are diagnosed and empiric treatment is begun
based on clinical findings, further diagnostic evaluation is important in hospitalized
patients. Chest radiography is important to try to define the cause and extent of the
pneumonia and to look for complications, such as parapneumonic effusion or lung
abscess. Unless the patient cannot mount an immune response, as in severe neutropenia,
or the process is very early, every patient with pneumonia will have a visible pulmonary
infiltrate.
The pattern of infiltration can yield diagnostic clues. Infection with S pneumoniae
classically presents with a dense lobar infiltrate, often with an associated parapneumonic effusion. Diffuse interstitial infiltrates are common in Pneumocystis
pneumonia and viral processes. Conversely, pleural effusions are almost never
seen in Pneumocystis pneumonia. Bilateral apical infiltrate suggests tuberculosis.
Appearance of cavitation suggests a necrotizing infection such as Staphylococcus
aureus, tuberculosis, or gram-negative organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Serial
chest radiography of inpatients usually is unnecessary, because many weeks are
required for the infiltrate to resolve; serial chest radiography typically is performed
if the patient does not show clinical improvement, has a pleural effusion, or has a
necrotizing infection.
Microbiologic studies, such as sputum Gram stain and culture, and blood cultures
are important to try to identify the specific etiologic agent causing the illness. However, use of sputum Gram stain and culture is limited by the frequent contamination
by upper respiratory flora as the specimen is expectorated. However, if the sputum
appears purulent and it is minimally contaminated (>25 polymorphonuclear cells
and <10 epithelial cells per low-power field), the diagnostic yield is good. Additionally, blood cultures can be helpful, because 30% to 40% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonias are bacteremic. Serologic studies can be performed to diagnose
patients who are infected with organisms not easily cultured, for example, Legionella,
Mycoplasma, or C pneumoniae.
Finally, fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage often is performed in seriously ill or immunocompromised patients, or in those patients

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

347

who are not responding to therapy, to try to obtain a specimen from the lower
respiratory tract for routine Gram stain and culture, as well as more sophisticated testing, such as direct fluorescent antibody testing for various organisms,
for example, Legionella.
Initially, empiric treatment is based upon the most common organisms given
the clinical scenario. For outpatient therapy of community-acquired pneumonia,
macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin, or antipneumococcal quinolones, such
as moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, are good choices for treatment of S pneumoniae,
Mycoplasma, and other common organisms. Hospitalized patients with communityacquired pneumonia usually are treated with an intravenous third-generation
cephalosporin plus a macrolide or with an antipneumococcal quinolone. For immunocompetent patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonias,
the causes include any of the organisms that can cause community-acquired
pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or S aureus, as well as more gram-negative
enteric bacteria and oral anaerobes. Accordingly, the initial antibiotic coverage
is broader and includes an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, such as piperacillin
or cefepime, plus an aminoglycoside. If MRSA is a consideration, linezolid is
often used.
Two other commonly confused pulmonary syndromes deserve mention at this
point. Aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury to the lungs caused by aspiration of acidic gastric contents into the lungs. Because of the high acidity, gastric
contents are normally sterile, so this is not an infectious process but rather a chemical burn that causes a severe inflammatory response, which is proportional to the
volume of the aspirate and the degree of acidity. This inflammatory response can be
profound and produce respiratory distress and a pulmonary infiltrate that is apparent within 4 to 6 hours and typically resolves within 48 hours. Aspiration of gastric
contents is most likely to occur in patients with a depressed level of consciousness,
such as those under anesthesia or suffering from a drug overdose, intoxication, or
after a seizure.
Aspiration pneumonia, by contrast, is an infectious process caused by inhalation of oropharyngeal secretions that are colonized by bacterial pathogens. It
should be noted that many healthy adults frequently aspirate small volumes of
oropharyngeal secretions while sleeping (this is the primary way that bacteria
gain entry to the lungs), but usually the material is cleared by coughing, ciliary
transport, or normal immune defenses so that no clinical infection results. However, any process that increases the volume or bacterial organism burden of the
secretion or impairs the normal defense mechanisms can produce clinically apparent pneumonia. This is most commonly seen in elderly patients with dysphagia,
such as stroke victims, who may aspirate significant volumes of oral secretions,
and those with poor dental care. The affected lobe of the lung depends upon the
patient’s position: in recumbent patients, the posterior segments of the upper lobes
and apical segments of the lower lobes are most common. In contrast to aspiration
pneumonitis, where aspiration of vomitus may be witnessed, the aspiration of oral
secretions typically is silent and should be suspected when any institutionalized
patient with dysphagia presents with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrate in a dependent segment of the lung.

348

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia is similar to that of other pneumonias, that is, it should cover typical respiratory pathogens such as S pneumoniae and
H influenzae, as well as gram-negative organisms and oral anaerobes. Treatment for
aspiration pneumonitis, because it usually is not infectious, is mainly supportive.
Antibiotics are often added if secondary bacterial infection is suspected because
of failure to improve within 48 hours, or if the gastric contents are suspected to be
colonized because of acid suppression or bowel obstruction.

349

ANSWERS
39.1 C. Legionella typically presents with myalgias, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
severe pneumonia.
39.2 C. This nursing home resident would be considered to have a nosocomial
rather than community-acquired infection, with a higher incidence of gramnegative infection. Her age and comorbid medical conditions place her at
high risk, requiring hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics such as a thirdgeneration cephalosporin.
39.3 D. Antibiotic therapy is generally not indicated for aspiration pneumonitis,
but patients need to be observed for clinical deterioration.

CLINICAL PEARLS


It is difficult to reliably distinguish clinically between typical and atypical
causes of pneumonia. Therefore, diagnosis and empiric treatment of
pneumonia are based upon the setting in which it was acquired (communityacquired or health-care associated) and the immune status of the host.



Clinical criteria, such as patient age, vital signs, mental status, and renal
function, can be used to risk stratify patients with pneumonia to decide
who can be treated as an outpatient and who requires hospitalization.



Although initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, the etiologic agent frequently
can be identified based on chest radiography, blood cultures, or sputum
Gram stain and culture.



Aspiration pneumonitis is a noninfectious chemical burn caused by
inhalation of acidic gastric contents in patients with a decreased level of
consciousness, such as seizure or overdose.



Aspiration pneumonia is pulmonary infection caused by aspiration of
colonized oropharyngeal secretions and is seen in patients with impaired
swallowing, such as stroke victims.

CASE 40
A 58-year-old woman comes to the office after a near-fainting spell she experienced
1 day ago. She was outside playing tennis when she vomited and felt lightheaded.
She spent the rest of the day lying down with mild, diffuse, abdominal pain and
nausea. She had no fever or diarrhea. She reports several months of worsening
fatigue; mild, intermittent, generalized abdominal pain; and loss of appetite
with a 10- to 15-lb unintentional weight loss. Her medical history is significant
for hypothyroidism for which she takes levothyroxine. She takes no medications.
On examination, her temperature is 99.8°F, heart rate 102 bpm, blood pressure
89/62 mm Hg, and normal respiratory rate. She does become lightheaded, and
her heart rate rises to 125 bpm upon standing with a drop in systolic blood pressure to 70 mm Hg. She is alert and well tanned, with hyperpigmented creases in
her hands. Her chest is clear, and her heart rhythm is tachycardic but regular. On
abdominal examination, she has normal bowel sounds and mild diffuse tenderness without guarding. Her pulses are rapid and thready. She has no peripheral
edema. Initial laboratory studies are significant for Na 121 mEq/L, K 5.8 mEq/L,
HCO3 16 mEq/L, glucose 52 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.0 mg/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 40:
Adrenal Insufficiency
Summary: A 58-year-old woman presents with orthostatic hypotension, intermittent chronic abdominal pain, and constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and
unintentional weight loss. She also has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and
hypoglycemia. All of this patient’s clinical features are consistent with acute adrenal
insufficiency. The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency is idiopathic autoimmune destruction.
• Most likely diagnosis: Primary adrenal insufficiency
• Next step: After drawing a cortisol level, immediate administration of intravenous saline with glucose and stress doses of corticosteroids

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the presentation of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency and of
adrenal crisis.
2. Know the most common causes of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.
3. Know the treatment of adrenal insufficiency.

Considerations
This patient has a low-grade fever, which may be a feature of adrenal insufficiency,
or it may signify infection, which can precipitate an adrenal crisis or produce a
similar clinical picture. It is important to diagnose and treat any underlying infection.
Because of the adrenal insufficiency and the aldosterone deficiency, she has volume
depletion and hypotension. Thus, intravenous replacement with normal saline is
critical.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Adrenal Insufficiency
DEFINITIONS
ADDISON DISEASE: Long-term insufficient function of the adrenal cortex leading to underproduction of corticosteroids.
ACTH STIMULATION TEST: An examination to evaluate the cortisol level
after an intravascular (IV) injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
A normal individual should have an increase in cortisol, whereas a patient with
adrenal insufficiency will have no response or a limited one.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

353

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiology
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) refers to adrenal failure to destruction or infiltration of the adrenal glands. The most common cause in the United
States is autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands. The most common cause
worldwide is tuberculous adrenalitis. Other causes include chronic granulomatous
infections (histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis), bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (usually
in the setting of sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]), adrenal
metastases (commonly from lung, breast, or stomach cancers), or X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a genetic disorder with adrenal and neurologic manifestations.
Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) often develop adrenal
involvement as a result of infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare. In primary adrenal insufficiency, the glands themselves are
destroyed so that the patient becomes deficient in cortisol and aldosterone. Primary
adrenal insufficiency is a relatively uncommon disease seen in clinical practice. A
high level of suspicion, particularly in individuals who have suggestive signs or
symptoms, or who are susceptible by virtue of associated autoimmune disorders or
malignancies must be maintained. The nonspecific symptoms might be otherwise
missed for many years until a stressful event leads to crisis and death.
Secondary adrenal insufficiency is adrenal failure caused by a lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation from the pituitary gland. It can be caused
by an autoimmune, infiltrative, metastatic disease of the pituitary. The most common reason, however, is chronic exogenous administration of corticosteroids,
which can suppress the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Because of the
widespread use of corticosteroids, secondary adrenal insufficiency is relatively common. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, the renin-angiotensin system usually is able
to maintain near-normal levels of aldosterone so that the patient is deficient only
in cortisol.

Clinical Features
The clinical presentation depends on the relative deficiency of glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids, ACTH excess, and other associated disorders. Acute adrenal
insufficiency, or Addisonian crisis, may present with weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. Laboratory findings
may include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, azotemia as a consequence of aldosterone deficiency, and hypoglycemia and eosinophilia as a consequence of cortisol deficiency. Patients with adrenal insufficiency may go into crisis
when stressed by infection, trauma, or surgery. The clinical features may appear
identical to those of septic shock; the only clues that the cause is adrenal disease
may be the hypoglycemia (blood sugar is often elevated in sepsis) and profound
hypotension, which may be refractory to administration of pressors but is reversed
almost immediately when steroids are given.
Chronic adrenal insufficiency has nonspecific clinical features, such as malaise,
weight loss, chronic fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia,
nausea, and vomiting. A patient may have hypoglycemia and postural hypotension

354

as a result of volume depletion. Hyperpigmentation is seen over time in primary
adrenal insufficiency caused by elevated melanocyte-stimulating hormone production from the pituitary as a byproduct of high ACTH levels. It is typically seen as
generalized hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes. It is increased in
sun-exposed areas or over pressure areas, such as elbows and knees, and may be
noted in skin folds. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, patients are deficient in
cortisol because of a lack of ACTH from the pituitary, but aldosterone production
is maintained by the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, volume depletion and
hyperkalemia are not present and the patient will not manifest the typical hyperpigmentation.

Diagnosis
Cortisol levels show a diurnal variation. Cortisol levels are high in the morning and
low as the day progresses, and levels should be elevated in stressful situations such as
acute medical illness, surgery, or trauma. A morning plasma cortisol level less than
or equal to 5 μg/dL in an acutely ill patient is definitive evidence of adrenal insufficiency. Conversely, a random cortisol level more than 20 μg/dL usually is interpreted
as evidence of intact adrenal function. As in other endocrine deficiency states, the
diagnostic test in this case is a stimulation test (conversely, in endocrine excess states,
the diagnostic test is often a suppression test). The ACTH stimulation test is used
to confirm primary adrenal insufficiency. Synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) 250 μg
is administered intravenously, and serum cortisol levels are measured at baseline
and then at 30- and 60-minute intervals. An increase in the cortisol level of 7 μg/
dL or a maximal stimulated level more than 18 μg/dL is considered normal and indicates intact adrenal function. If cosyntropin stimulation testing indicates probable
adrenal insufficiency, ACTH levels can then be measured to distinguish between
primary (high ACTH) and secondary (low ACTH) adrenal failure.
The insulin–glucose tolerance test is the gold standard for testing the entire
hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It is based on the principle that if a stressful situation
is induced (in this case, hypoglycemia), the ACTH level should rise with a consequent increase in cortisol levels. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) are helpful in evaluating adrenal and pituitary disease
after biochemical confirmation.

Treatment
Treatment of Addisonian crisis includes intravenous 5% glucose with normal
saline to correct volume depletion and hypoglycemia and administration of corticosteroid therapy. Hydrocortisone usually is given intravenously at doses of 100 mg
every 6 to 8 hours, or it can be given as a bolus followed by a continuous infusion. At
high doses, the hydrocortisone provides both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
activity. A cortisol level should be drawn before treatment to confirm the diagnosis.
Causes of the acute crisis should be identified and treated; in particular, there should
be a search for infection.
Long-term treatment of patients with primary adrenal insufficiency includes
replacement doses of glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone 25-30 mg/d) and mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone 0.1-0.2 mg/d). Patients with secondary adrenal

insufficiency still produce aldosterone, as mentioned earlier, so only glucocorticoids
must be replaced. In both cases, to prevent the long-term complications of glucocorticoid excess (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, cataracts), patients
should not be overtreated. Stress doses of steroids should be given for intercurrent
illnesses. Patients should wear a medical alert bracelet.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

356

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
40.1 D. Long-term steroid use, with secondary suppression of pituitary secretion
of ACTH, is the most common cause of secondary adrenal insufﬁciency.
Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal
insufﬁciency.
40.2 A. A stress dose of corticosteroids is important to prevent adrenal insufﬁciency
before surgery.
40.3 D. Hyperpigmentation occurs as a result of increased melanocyte-stimulating
factor, a byproduct of ACTH, and occurs in primary adrenal insufﬁciency. Secondary causes of adrenal insufﬁciency such as Sheehan syndrome result in low
ACTH levels and do not cause the “tanned” appearance.
40.4 C. Elevated cortisol greater than 5 μg/dL in the morning after a dose of dexamethasone at night indicates autonomous ACTH production (failure to be
suppressed with dexamethasone). ACTH stimulation test is for adrenal insufﬁciency. Cortisol levels vary throughout the day, and are only useful when
elevated to exclude adrenal insufﬁciency. Most ACTH-producing pituitary
tumors are less than 5 mm and may not be seen on MRI.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Primary adrenal insufficiency presents with weakness, fatigue, abdominal
pain with vomiting, hyperpigmentation, and hyponatremia with hypotension, which may be refractory to pressors.



Treatment of adrenal crisis is immediate administration of salt (saline),
sugar (glucose), and steroids (hydrocortisone).



The most common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency in the United
States are autoimmune destruction, metastatic disease, and infectious
causes (eg, cytomegalovirus in advanced acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome). The most common cause worldwide is tuberculosis.



Secondary adrenal insufficiency is the most common form of the illness
and usually is a result of suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
by exogenous corticosteroids.

A 57-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of malaise for several weeks.
He says that he has not been feeling well for some time, with fatigue, depressed
mood, loss of appetite, and a 20-lb unintentional weight loss. In addition, he has
been bothered by generalized itching of his skin and has tried moisturizing lotions

vomiting, or diarrhea. He does think his stools have been lighter in color recently.
He has no other medical history and takes no medications except for a multivitamin.
He drinks alcohol occasionally and smokes cigars.
On examination, he is afebrile, with heart rate 68 bpm and blood pressure
128/74 mm Hg. He has a flat affect and a somewhat disheveled appearance. He
has noticeable icterus of his sclera and skin. His chest is clear, and his heart rhythm
is regular without murmurs. His abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel
sounds, a liver span of 10 cm, and no splenomegaly or masses. His skin has a few
excoriations on his arms and back, but no rashes or telangiectasias.

ANSWERS TO CASE 41:
Painless Jaundice, Pancreatic Cancer
Summary: A 57-year-old man presents with pruritus, weight loss, and light-colored
stools. He is found to be jaundiced with markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase
level and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. All of these findings point toward cholestasis. The light-colored, or acholic, stools suggest the cholestasis is most likely
caused by biliary obstruction. The absence of abdominal pain makes gallstone disease less likely.
• Most likely diagnosis: Biliary obstruction, most likely caused by malignancy
• Next step: Imaging procedure of his biliary system, either ultrasonography or
computed tomographic (CT) scan

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the causes and evaluation of a patient with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
2. For a patient with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, be able to distinguish between
hepatocellular disease and biliary obstruction.
3. Understand the evaluation of a patient with cholestasis.
4. Know the treatment and complications of biliary obstruction.

Considerations
In patients with jaundice, one must try to distinguish between hepatic and biliary
disease. In the patient with suspected biliary obstruction, without the pain typically
associated with gallstones, one should be suspicious of malignancy or strictures. In
the case presented, the clinical picture is worrisome for a malignant cause of biliary
obstruction, such as pancreatic cancer.

APPROACH TO:
Painless Jaundice
DEFINITIONS
CHOLESTASIS: Deficient bile flow that can result from intrahepatic disease or
extrahepatic obstruction.
CONJUGATED BILIRUBIN (DIRECT-REACTING BILIRUBIN): Bilirubin
that has entered the liver and has been enzymatically bound to glucuronic acid
forming bilirubin monoglucuronide or diglucuronide.
JAUNDICE OR ICTERUS: Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, indicating
hyperbilirubinemia.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

359

UNCONJUGATED BILIRUBIN (INDIRECT-REACTING BILIRUBIN):
Bilirubin that has not been enzymatically bound to glucuronic acid by the liver and
is in the serum reversibly and noncovalently bound to albumin.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Jaundice, or icterus, is the visible manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia and usually
can be noticed by physical examination when the serum bilirubin level exceeds
2.0 to 2.5 mg/dL. Traditional instruction regarding the jaundiced patient divides the
mechanism of hyperbilirubinemia into prehepatic (excessive production of bilirubin),
intrahepatic, or extrahepatic (as in biliary obstruction). For most patients with
jaundice, it probably is more clinically useful to think about hepatic or biliary diseases
that cause conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia, because they represent the most
clinically important causes of jaundice.
The term unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia is used when the conjugated (or direct-reacting fraction) does not exceed 15% of the total bilirubin. It is
almost always caused by hemolysis, or Gilbert syndrome. In these conditions, the
serum bilirubin level almost always is less than 5 mg/dL, and there is usually no
other clinical signs of liver disease. In addition, there should be no bilirubinuria
(only conjugated bilirubin can be filtered and renally excreted). Hemolysis usually
is clinically apparent, as in sickle cell disease or autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition caused by a deficiency of hepatic enzymatic
conjugation of bilirubin, which results in intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Total bilirubin is usually less than 4 g/dL, and is often precipitated by events
such as stress, fasting, and febrile illnesses. It is not associated with liver dysfunction
and requires no therapy.
Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia almost always reflects either hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction. These two conditions can be differentiated
by the pattern of elevation of the liver enzymes. Elevation of serum AST and ALT
levels is characteristic of hepatocellular disease as a result of the inflammation/
destruction of the hepatocytes and the release of these enzymes into the blood.
The serum alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in cholestatic disease as a consequence of inflammation, destruction, or obstruction of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts with relative sparing of the hepatocytes. The serum AST and
ALT levels may be mildly elevated in cholestasis but usually not to the levels
seen in primary acute hepatocellular disease. Other tests, such as serum albumin
or PT, generally reflect the capacity of hepatocytes to synthesize proteins such as
clotting factors. When they are abnormal, they most often reflect hepatocellular
disease. Table 41–1 summarizes the liver test patterns seen in various categories of
hepatobiliary disorders.
The patient discussed in this case has a pattern consistent with cholestasis, and
the first diagnostic test in a patient with cholestasis usually is an ultrasound. It
is noninvasive and is very sensitive for detecting stones in the gallbladder as well
as intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The most common cause of
biliary obstruction in the United States is gallstones, which may become lodged
in the common bile duct. However, obstructing stones causing jaundice usually

including cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and ampullary cancer (ampulla

Other possible causes include strictures, which can result from prior biliary surgery,
prior inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis (rarely), inflammatory diseases of
the biliary tree, and infection in the setting of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS). The two most important primary conditions are primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Table 41–2 compares features of these two
entities.
The complications of biliary obstruction include development of acute cholangitis
as a result of ascending infection, or secondary hepatic cirrhosis, if the obstruction
is chronic or recurrent. The patient in this case scenario has painless jaundice, liver
enzymes consistent with a cholestatic process, and light-colored stools, suggesting
obstruction of bile flow into the intestine. Because he has no history of abdominal
or biliary surgery that might have caused a stricture, malignancy is the most likely
cause of his biliary obstruction. The most common malignancy to present in this
way is pancreatic cancer. The patient should undergo an imaging procedure of his
abdomen, including a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate the biliary tree,
as well as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the pancreas.
Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration is highly accurate in establishing
a tissue diagnosis.
Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
Peak incidence is in the seventh decade of life, with two-thirds of cases occurring
in persons older than 65 years. There is a slight male predominance and a higher
incidence in the black population. The median survival is 9 months, with an overall
5-year survival rate of 3%. Clinically apparent metastatic disease is found in
80% of patients at the time of diagnosis. For patients without obvious metastases, the best hope for cure is surgical resection by pancreaticoduodenectomy
(Whipple procedure), which in experienced hands has a perioperative mortality
rate less than 5%. Even when the cancer is considered to be resectable, there
is a high rate of recurrence; so many treatment programs include neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Alternate palliative therapy includes pancreatic and common
bile duct stenting to relieve the obstruction.

ALT 150 U/mL, alkaline phosphatase 120 U/mL, total bilirubin 25 mg/dL,
direct bilirubin 12 mg/dL, and albumin 2.1 g/dL.
41.2 A 40-year-old moderately obese woman presents with abdominal pain after

bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL, and albumin 3.5 g/dL.
41.3 A 25-year-old man presents with 3 days of scleral icterus but has been otherwise feeling well. His laboratory results are AST 45 U/L, ALT 48 U/L, alkaline
phosphatase 100 U/L, total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, and
albumin 3.5 g/dL. Complete blood count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
are normal.
41.4 A 32-year-old man with a 5-year history of episodic bloody diarrhea and
abdominal cramping pain presents with scleral icterus and fever. His laboratory
results are AST 100 U/L, ALT 125 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 550 U/L, total
bilirubin 5.5 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 3.0 mg/dL, and albumin 2.9 g/dL.

ANSWERS
41.1 B. The patient’s laboratory results show a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with
evidence of hepatocellular disease (hypoalbuminemia, ascites). The AST and
ALT levels show the 2:1 ratio consistent with alcohol-related liver disease.
41.2 E. The patient’s laboratory results show a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia consistent with an obstructive pattern. She has the risk factors for gallstones
(middle age, female, obese) and has symptoms of postprandial abdominal
pain.
41.3 C. The patient’s laboratory results show an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
without other abnormality. He is otherwise healthy without symptoms of
systemic disease or hemolytic anemia. No treatment is necessary.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

363

41.4 F . The patient’s laboratory results show a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
with an obstructive pattern. The history is consistent with inﬂammatory
bowel disease, which is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The
initial evaluation should include ultrasonography to rule out gallstones; if
negative, ERCP could conﬁrm the diagnosis by demonstrating multiple strictures of the extrahepatic bile ducts. Treatment options include stenting of
the larger bile duct strictures and immunosuppression to slow the progression
of the disease.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia usually is caused by hemolysis
or Gilbert syndrome.



Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia is commonly caused by hepatocellular disease, with elevated AST and ALT levels, or biliary obstruction,
with elevated alkaline phosphatase level.



An imaging procedure such as ultrasonography is the initial study of
choice in a patient with cholestasis to evaluate for intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary obstruction.



The most common causes of biliary obstruction are gallstones, which
are painful if obstructing, and strictures or neoplasms, which are often
painless.



Pancreatic cancer is initially diagnosed and staged by CT; the best hope
for cure is resection by a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure).

CASE 42
While seeing patients in your preceptor’s clinic, you have the opportunity to meet
and examine one of her long-time patients, a 52-year-old woman who presents for
her yearly physical examination. She has been fine and has no complaints today.
Her medical history is notable only for borderline hypertension and moderate
obesity. Last year her fasting lipid profile was acceptable for someone without
known risk factors for coronary artery disease. Her mother and older brother have
diabetes and hypertension. At prior visits, you see that your preceptor has counseled her on a low-calorie, low-fat diet and recommended that she start an exercise
program. However, the patient says she has not made any of these recommended
changes. With her full-time job and three children, she finds it difficult to exercise,
and she admits that her family eats out frequently. Today her blood pressure is
140/92 mm Hg. Her body mass index (BMI) is 29 kg/m2. Her examination is notable
for acanthosis nigricans at the neck but otherwise is normal. A Papanicolaou (Pap)
smear is performed, and a mammogram is offered. The patient has not eaten yet
today, so on your preceptor’s recommendation, a fasting plasma glucose test is
performed, and the result is 140 mg/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 42:
Type 2 Diabetes Diagnosis and Management
Summary: A 52-year-old woman presents for her yearly physical examination. Her
medical history is notable only for borderline hypertension and moderate obesity.
She has a family history of diabetes and hypertension. The patient has not followed
the recommended lifestyle changes. Today, her blood pressure is 140/92 mm Hg,
and her BMI is 29 kg/m2. Her examination is notable for acanthosis nigricans at
the neck, suggesting insulin resistance. A fasting plasma glucose level is 140 mg/dL,
which is consistent with diabetes mellitus.
• Most likely diagnosis: Given her obesity, family history, and the finding of acanthosis nigricans, this patient most likely has type 2 diabetes. Diagnostic criteria
for diabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association include: (1) symptoms of diabetes and (2) fasting plasma glucose of 126 mg/dL or greater.
• Next step: Check hemoglobin A1C.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes.
2. Understand the initial medical management of diabetes.
3. Understand cardiovascular risk modification in diabetic patients.
4. Understand the prevention of microvascular complications of diabetes.

Considerations
If this patient’s diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed, she will require patient education,
lifestyle modification, and medical therapy to prevent acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Strict glycemic control can reduce the incidence of microvascular
complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. In addition, patients with diabetes are among the highest at risk for cardiovascular disease, so risk factor modifications, such as smoking cessation and lowering of cholesterol, are essential. Diabetes
confers the same level of risk for coronary events, such as heart attack, as in
patients with established coronary artery disease. Thus, in this patient, the target
blood pressure is less than 130/80 mm Hg, and the target low-density-lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol is less than 100 mg/dL.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

367

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Diabetes Mellitus
DEFINITIONS
TYPE 1 DIABETES: Autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells and
complete loss of endogenous insulin production. The presentation of this type of
diabetes usually is acute, with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. These patients
are dependent upon exogenous insulin delivery.
TYPE 2 DIABETES: Heterogeneous syndrome of insulin resistance caused by
genetic factors and/or obesity and relative insulin deficiency. Oral medications to
enhance endogenous insulin production or improve insulin sensitivity are useful.
Exogenous insulin may be used when oral medications are no longer sufficient for
adequate glycemic control.

CLINICAL APPROACH
As the prevalence of obesity increases in the American population, so does the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Ninety percent of all new cases of diabetes diagnosed
in the United States are type 2, and it is estimated that this disease affects approximately 7% of the population older than 45 years. Diabetes is the leading cause of
blindness, renal failure, and nontraumatic amputations of the lower extremities.
It is a major risk factor in patients with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, and stroke.
In contrast to type 1 diabetics, patients with type 2 diabetes usually have a
prolonged asymptomatic phase. During these years of asymptomatic hyperglycemia,
however, organ damage begins to occur. Therefore, several organizations recommend
screening of certain high-risk populations. The risk factors for diabetes include
obesity or overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2); other signs of an insulin-resistance syndrome
or “metabolic” syndrome, such as hypertension or low high-density lipoproteins
(HDLs) and triglycerides more than 250 mg/dL; first-degree relative with diabetes;
history of gestational diabetes; or being a member of a high-risk ethnic group,
including African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian Americans, or
Pacific Islanders. Screening should be performed every 3 years beginning at age
45 years, or earlier if overweight with BMI >25 kg/m2.
Most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic for years before developing overt diabetes. They are able to maintain normoglycemia for a long time, then develop postprandial hyperglycemia, and later develop
both postprandial and fasting hyperglycemia (ie, hyperglycemia all the time). Thus,
a glucose tolerance test to detect postprandial hyperglycemia would be the most
sensitive test for diabetes mellitus but is time consuming and difficult to perform in
a clinical practice. The fasting plasma glucose is the most specific test. Hemoglobin
A1C (A1C) >6.5% has now also been recognized as an acceptable diagnostic criteria
(Table 42–1). If there are no clear symptoms of hyperglycemia, the diagnosis of
diabetes must be confirmed on a subsequent day by repeat measurement, repeating
the same test for confirmation. However, if two different tests (eg, fasting glucose

and A1C) are available and are concordant for the diagnosis of diabetes, additional
testing is not needed.
By using these tests, patients can be classified into one of three categories:
(1) normal, (2) impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose (ie, “prediabetic”),
or (3) diabetic. Increased risk for microvascular complications of hyperglycemia is
seen at a fasting glucose more than 126 mg/dL or A1C >6.5% (see Table 42–1). Once
diabetes is diagnosed, therapy is instituted with three major goals.
1. Prevention of acute complications of hyperglycemia (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis or
nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia) or hypoglycemia
2. Prevention of long-term complications of hyperglycemia, for example, microvascular disease such as retinopathy or nephropathy
3. Prevention of long-term complications of macrovascular disease, for example,
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease
The foundation of diabetes therapy is dietary and lifestyle modifications. Exercise
and even small amounts of weight loss can lower blood pressure and improve glucose control. Patients should be given instruction in nutrition and encouraged to
change sedentary lifestyles.
However, most people with diabetes will eventually require medical therapy, and
many patients will eventually require a combination of at least two medications.
Because of the difficulty in achieving and sustaining glycemic targets and achieving
significant weight loss, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends
that metformin should be initiated concurrent with lifestyle intervention at the
time of diagnosis. Glycemic goals should be an A1C <7.0%, preprandial glucose
readings of 70 to 130 mg/dL, or peak postprandial glucose <180 mg/dL. If patients
fail to achieve these goals with initial therapy including lifestyle modification and
metformin, therapeutic options include adding a second oral or injectable agent,
including insulin, or switching to insulin monotherapy. A list of therapeutic agents
for diabetes is included in Table 42–2.
When diabetes is diagnosed, other cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed.
Blood pressure and lipid levels should be measured. With regard to lipid therapy, the
cardiovascular risk in those with diabetes is equivalent to those with known coronary artery disease, so the desired LDL goal is <100 mg/dL. Those with higher LDL
levels should undergo dietary modification, or be started on a statin.

The desired blood pressure goal is <130/80 mm Hg. Several randomized trials
have demonstrated a benefit for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in preventing the progression of
proteinuria and kidney disease. Patients who already have renal insufficiency or heavy
proteinuria (>1–2 g/d) have an even lower target blood pressure of 120/75 mm Hg.
Other routine care in diabetic patients includes frequent physician visits, at least
every 3 to 6 months depending on their glucose control, at least yearly ophthalmologic examinations to screen for retinopathy, and yearly urine screens to detect
microalbuminuria. Hemoglobin A1C should be checked at least every 3 to 6 months,
depending on the patient’s glucose control. This test allows the physician to know
the general glucose control over the preceding 2 to 3 months. Patients without
neuropathy should have a foot examination yearly to detect early neuropathic
changes; however, those with neuropathy should be examined every 3 months and
be instructed on daily self-examination and prevention of injury.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
42.1 A patient comes in for a fasting plasma glucose test. On two separate occasions, the result has been 115 mg/dL and 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is
the most appropriate next step?
A. Reassurance that these are normal blood sugars.
B. Recommend weight loss, an ADA diet, and exercise.
C. Diagnose diabetes mellitus and start on a sulfonylurea.
D. Recommend cardiac stress testing.
E. Obtain stat arterial blood gas and serum ketone levels.
42.2 A 45-year-old obese Hispanic woman presents for follow-up of her diabetes.
She currently takes metformin 1000 mg twice per day, and her fasting morning
glucose runs approximately 170 to 200 mg/dL. Her last HbA1C was 7.9. She
states that she conscientiously follows her diet and that she walks 30 minutes
to 1 hour daily. Which of the following is the best next step in her care?
A. Refer to an endocrinologist for an insulin pump.
B. Stop metformin, and start on glimepiride.
C. Add once-a-day injection of insulin glargine (Lantus).
D. Hospitalize her urgently.
42.3 A 75-year-old woman with diabetes for approximately 20 years, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic nephropathy with creatinine level 2.2 mg/dL is brought
into the clinic by her daughter for follow-up. The patient currently takes a
sulfonylurea for her diabetes and an ACE inhibitor for her proteinuria. Her
daughter reports that, on three occasions in the past 2 weeks, her mother
became sweaty, shaky, and confused, which resolved when she was given some
orange juice. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be contributing
to these episodes?
A. Excess caloric oral intake
B. Interaction between the ACE inhibitor and the sulfonylurea agents
C. Worsening renal function
D. Hyperglycemic amnesia

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

371

ANSWERS
42.1 B. By diagnostic criteria, this patient falls into the deﬁnition of impaired fasting glucose. Although she does not yet meet the criteria for diabetes, she is at
greater risk for developing diabetes in the future and for macrovascular disease.
Intensive lifestyle changes (diet and exercise for 30 minutes per day, 5 days
per week) can reduce or delay the development of diabetes. Patients should be
monitored annually to screen for progression to diabetes.
42.2 B. When patients fail to achieve glycemic goal (A1C <7.0%) using metformin
and lifestyle modiﬁcations, the next step is to either add a once-daily basal
insulin injection (a long-acting insulin such as NPH, glargine, or detemir) or a
sulfonylurea to the regimen. Switching from one class of oral agent to another
with similar potency would add no beneﬁt.
42.3 C. Sulfonylureas have long half-lives and can cause prolonged hypoglycemia
in elderly patients as well in those with renal insufﬁciency. Another method,
such as insulin, may be more appropriate in this patient, as well as less-intensive
control, aiming for an HbA1C of 8% instead of 7%.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Type 2 diabetes has a prolonged asymptomatic stage during which microvascular disease (eg, retinopathy or nephropathy) can occur. Physicians
should have a high index of suspicion and screen those patients with risk
factors.



Lifestyle modification and metformin are the initial therapy for most
patients initially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.



The major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus is macrovascular disease, such as coronary artery
disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, so aggressive cardiovascular risk factor reduction is essential.



Glycemic goals are A1C <7.0%, preprandial glucose 70-130 mg/dL, or
postprandial glucose <180 mg/dL. Blood pressure should be <130/80,
and LDL cholesterol should be <100 mg/dL.

CASE 43
An 18-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her mother because
the daughter seems confused and is behaving strangely. The mother reports the
patient has always been healthy and has no significant medical history, but she has
lost 20 lb recently without trying and has been complaining of fatigue for 2 or 3 weeks.
The patient had attributed the fatigue to sleep disturbance, as recently she has
been getting up several times at night to urinate. This morning, the mother found
the patient in her room, complaining of abdominal pain, and she had vomited.
She appeared confused and did not know that today was a school day.
On examination, the patient is slender, lying on a stretcher with eyes closed,
but she is responsive to questions. She is afebrile, and has a heart rate 118 bpm,
blood pressure 125/84 mm Hg, with deep and rapid respirations at the rate of
24 breaths per minute. Upon standing, her heart rate rises to 145 bpm, and her
blood pressure falls to 110/80 mm Hg. Her funduscopic examination is normal,
her oral mucosa is dry, and her neck veins are flat. Her chest is clear to auscultation,
and her heart is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmur. Her abdomen
is soft with active bowel sounds and mild diffuse tenderness, but no guarding or
rebound. Her neurologic examination reveals no focal deficits.
Laboratory studies include serum Na 131 mEq/L, K 5.3 mEq/L, Cl 95 mEq/L,
CO2 9 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 35 mg/dL, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, and
glucose 475 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas reveals pH 7.12 with PCO2 24 mm Hg
and PO2 95 mm Hg. Urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test are negative, and
urinalysis shows no hematuria or pyuria, but 3+ glucose and 3+ ketones. Chest
radiograph is read as normal, and plain film of the abdomen has nonspecific gas
pattern but no signs of obstruction.

ANSWERS TO CASE 43:
Diabetic Ketoacidosis
Summary: An 18-year-old woman presents with unintentional weight loss, nocturia,
and polyuria, with hyperglycemia that likely represents new-onset diabetes
mellitus, probably type 1. She is hypovolemic as a result of osmotic diuresis and has
an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is primarily caused by ketoacids. Her mental
status and abdominal pain probably are manifestations of the metabolic acidosis and
hyperosmolarity.
• Most likely diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
• Next step: Aggressive hydration to improve her volume status and insulin therapy to resolve the ketoacidosis

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know how to diagnose patients with anion gap metabolic acidosis.
2. Be able to differentiate DKA, nonketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, and
alcoholic ketoacidosis.
3. Understand the principles of DKA management: restoration of volume, electrolyte replacement, resolution of ketosis, and control of hyperglycemia.
4. Learn the complications of DKA and of improper management.

Considerations
DKA occurs as a result of severe insulin deficiency and may be the initial presentation of diabetes mellitus, as in this patient. In all patients with DKA, one must be
alert for precipitating factors, such as infection, pregnancy, or severe physiologic
stressors, such as myocardial infarction. Careful management and close monitoring
will be required to correct fluid and electrolyte deficits and to prevent complications
such as hypokalemia and cerebral edema.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Diabetic Ketoacidosis
DEFINITIONS
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS: A syndrome of hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketone bodies in the serum, caused by insufficient insulin levels.
KUSSMAUL RESPIRATIONS: Deep and rapid breathing; represent hyperventilation in an attempt to generate a respiratory alkalosis to compensate for the

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

375

CLINICAL APPROACH
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a clinical syndrome that results when the triad of anion
gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis is present and is caused by a
significant insulin deficiency. It is a medical emergency, with an overall mortality
rate less than 5% if patients receive prompt and appropriate medical treatment. The
majority of episodes are preventable, and many of the deaths also are preventable
with proper attention to detail during management.

Pathophysiology
In the normal physiologic state, there is a fine balance between anabolic and
catabolic hormones. In the fed state, anabolic actions of insulin predominate.
Glycogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis all are increased. This results in
storage of energy reserves in the form of triglycerides and glycogen.
In the fasting state, insulin serves to inhibit lipolysis, ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and proteolysis. These effects are critical in controlling the rate
of breakdown of energy stores under the influence of catabolic hormones. Glucagon
is the most important catabolic hormone. In the fasting state, it maintains normal
glucose levels by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.
Diabetes is the condition of relative or absolute insulin deficiency. When there
is a severe insulin deficiency and a relative excess of glucagon, lipolysis is enhanced,
causing release of free fatty acids. Oxidation of the fatty acids produces ketones,
such as acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, which are organic acids and often
referred to as ketoacids. The excess of these ketoacids can produce a life-threatening
metabolic acidosis. In addition, hyperglycemia produces an osmotic diuresis, which
causes severe volume depletion, and electrolyte deficiencies by washing extracellular sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, and water out of the body. The
combination of acidosis, hypovolemia, and electrolyte deficiencies can lead to cardiovascular collapse, the most common cause of death in DKA.

Clinical Presentation
Patients with diabetes have an underlying impairment in glucose metabolism and,
when challenged by a stress, an increase in insulin requirements. If they are unable
to meet these insulin requirements, DKA may result. The most common precipitating events are infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection, vascular
disorders such as myocardial infarction, or other stressors such as trauma. Diabetic
ketoacidosis may be the presentation of new-onset diabetes, or it can occur in
patients with established diabetes because of failure to use insulin for whatever reason or because of use of other medications (eg, glucocorticoids) that interfere with
insulin action.
An episode of DKA evolves over a short period of time, typically less than 24 hours.
The patient with DKA has the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia, acidosis, and
dehydration. Polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, visual blurring, and decreased mental
status are related to hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath may be related to the acidosis.
Typical signs include reduced skin elasticity, dry mucous membranes, hypotension, and tachycardia related to volume depletion. Kussmaul respirations, deep and

376

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

rapid breathing, represent hyperventilation in an attempt to generate a respiratory
alkalosis to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. One may also note the fruity
breath odor typical of ketosis.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory values show hyperglycemia (usually >250 mg/dL), acidosis (pH <7.3),
anion gap (usually >15 mmol/L), and ketonemia. The most important laboratory
parameters are the degree of acidosis, the anion gap, and the serum potassium level.
Patients with a very low pH (<7.0) are severely acidotic and have a worse prognosis. The lower pH is a result of the higher concentration of ketoacids, which are
estimated using the anion gap. The first step in evaluating any patient with metabolic
acidosis should be calculation of the anion gap. This concept is based on the principle
of electrical neutrality, that is, all the cations must equal all the anions. The anion
gap estimates those negatively charged particles that are not routinely measured and
can be calculated using the following calculation:
Anion Gap = [Na] − [Cl + HCO3]
The normal anion gap is 10 to 12 mmol/L. When it is elevated, there is an excess
of unmeasured anions, which typically occurs because of one of the four causes,
which are listed in Table 43–1.
Lactic acidosis can be a result of severe tissue hypoxia, as in septic shock or
carbon monoxide poisoning, or a result of hepatic failure and subsequent inability
to metabolize lactate. Ketoacidosis most commonly occurs as an acute complication of uncontrolled diabetes, but it also can be seen in starvation and alcoholism
(discussed later). The ingested toxins may be organic acids themselves, such as salicylic
acid, or have acidic metabolites, such as formic acid from methanol. Renal failure
leads to an inability to excrete organic acids as well as inorganic acids such as
phosphates (often without an anion gap).
In patients with DKA, total body potassium stores are depleted because of
urinary losses, and potassium replacement will always be necessary. Initially, the
measured serum potassium levels may be high despite the total body potassium deficit
because of acidosis resulting in movement of potassium from the intracellular to the

377

extracellular compartment. As the acidosis is corrected and with the administration of insulin, which drives potassium intracellularly, serum potassium levels
will fall rapidly.
The serum sodium level can be variable. Hyperglycemia causes water to move
extracellularly, which can lead to hyponatremia. Similarly, phosphate levels can be
variable in the presence of body store deficits with the extracellular movement of
phosphate caused by catabolic state. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine
levels are elevated, reflecting dehydration. Serum acetoacetate may cause a false
elevation in serum creatinine level because of interference with the assay.

Management
The goal of treatment is restoration of metabolic homeostasis with correction of
precipitating events and biochemical deficits, which consists of the following:
1. Replacement of fluid losses with improvement of circulatory volume
2. Correction of hyperglycemia and, in turn, plasma osmolality
3. Replacement of electrolyte losses
4. Clearance of serum ketones
5. Identification and treatment of precipitating cause and complications
Close monitoring of the patient is important. A flow sheet recording vital signs,
input and output, insulin dosage, and metabolic progress is important. Serum glucose
concentration should be measured every 1 hour, and levels of serum electrolytes and
phosphate must be assessed every 3 to 5 hours. Urinalysis, urine and blood cultures,
ECG, and chest x-ray should be obtained to identify precipitating factors and complications. Other investigations should be pursued as symptoms and signs warrant.

Fluids
All patients with DKA are volume depleted as a consequence of osmotic diuresis
as well as from other ongoing losses, such as vomiting. Hydration improves renal
perfusion and cardiac output, facilitating glucose excretion. Rehydration may also
diminish insulin resistance by decreasing levels of counterregulatory hormones and
hyperglycemia. Sudden reduction in hyperglycemia can lead to vascular collapse
with shift of water intracellularly. To avoid this, initial replacement fluid should be
isotonic normal saline (NS) to correct circulatory volume deficit. Over the first
hour, 1 to 2 L of NS should be infused. Following this, total body water deficit is
corrected at the rate of 250 to 500 mL/h, depending on the state of hydration. The
composition of fluid should be tailored according to serum sodium and chloride
measurements.
Hydration should be gentler in patients with congestive heart failure or end-stage
renal disease because such patients can easily get fluid overload.

Insulin
The goal of therapy is a glucose reduction of 80 to 100 mg/dL/h. Use of continuous
low-dose intravenous infusion of insulin is recommended because it reduces episodes

378

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, and it allows a more controlled reduction of serum
glucose and osmolality. Intramuscular and subcutaneous routes can be used if tissue
perfusion is adequate.
Insulin treatment may be initiated as an intravenous bolus of 0.1 to 0.15 U/kg.
This should be followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 U/kg/h with hourly serum
glucose determinations. If blood glucose fails to decline at the desired rate, volume
status should be reassessed, and insulin infusion should be titrated. The rate of infusion should be decreased to 0.05 U/kg/h when the blood glucose level decreases to
250 to 300 mg/dL. Glucose levels fall more quickly than ketosis resolves. Insulin
is necessary for resolution of the ketoacidosis and can be coadministered with a glucose infusion until the anion gap is resolved. A 5% to 10% dextrose solution should
be added to the hydrating solution when plasma glucose is less than 300 mg/dL.
One can judge the resolution of ketoacidosis when the bicarbonate is more than
18 mEq/L, the anion gap is less than 12, the patient feels better, and the vital
signs are stabilized. Serial determination of serum ketone levels is not clinically
useful in measuring response to therapy. Laboratory tests measure acetoacetate and
acetone, but not beta-hydroxybutyrate. With the administration of insulin, betahydroxybutyrate is first oxidized to acetoacetate, so measured ketone levels may
actually increase with effective therapy. Instead, one should be guided by normalizing
the anion gap when making decisions about the rate of insulin infusion. Subcutaneous
insulin should be given approximately 30 minutes before stopping insulin infusion to
avoid rebound acidosis.

Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate therapy is controversial and should not be given to ketoacidotic
patients unless their arterial pH is less than 7.0 or other indications, such as cardiac instability or severe hyperkalemia, are present. Bicarbonate therapy can cause
worsening hypokalemia, paradoxical central nervous system acidosis, and delay in
ketone clearance.

Electrolytes
In DKA, there is deficit of total body potassium, phosphate, and magnesium.
Patients frequently have hyperkalemia as a result of acidosis, insulin deficiency,
and hypertonicity that cause a shift of potassium extracellularly. During treatment, plasma potassium concentration will fall as the metabolic abnormalities are
corrected. Potassium should be added to initial intravenous fluids once the concentration is less than 5 mEq/L. Once adequate urine output is established, 20 to
40 mEq of potassium should be added to each liter of fluid. The goal is to maintain
potassium in the range of 4 to 5 mEq/L. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in the
presence of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia.
Phosphate replacement should be given to patients with serum phosphate concentrations less than 1 mg/dL and to patients with moderate hypophosphatemia
with concomitant hypoxia, anemia, or cardiorespiratory compromise. Careful monitoring of the serum calcium level is necessary with phosphate administration.
Magnesium and calcium can be supplemented as needed.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

379

Precipitating Causes
It is important to correct precipitating factors in order to restore metabolic balance.
Identifiable sources of infection should be treated aggressively. Possible presence of
ischemia and infarction should be evaluated and treated appropriately with help
from specialists as needed.

Complications
Cerebral edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolism, fluid overload, and acute gastric dilatation are rare, but serious, complications of DKA.

Prevention
The major precipitating factors in the development of DKA are inadequate insulin
treatment and infection. These events can be prevented by patient education and
effective communication with a health-care team. Sick-day management regarding
dosing of insulin, blood glucose monitoring, avoiding prolonged fasting, and preventing dehydration should be addressed. Socioeconomic barriers contribute to the
high rates of admission for DKA. Appropriate allocation of health-care resources
toward preventive strategies is needed.
Other metabolic complications of deranged carbohydrate metabolism deserve
mention at this point. The first is hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic coma. This
condition occurs mainly in patients with type 2 diabetes who become profoundly
dehydrated because of osmotic diuresis. However, these patients have sufficient
insulin action to prevent the development of ketoacidosis. They may present with
glucose levels more than 1000 mg/dL, serum osmolarity more than 320 to 370 Osm,
and neurologic symptoms ranging from confusion to seizures to coma. Compared to
patients with DKA, they have a much larger fluid deficit, and therapy is primarily
volume resuscitation with NS. Insulin is also used to reverse hyperglycemia but usually is given in lesser doses than is required for clearance of ketosis in DKA.
Alcoholic ketoacidosis develops in chronic alcoholics who are malnourished and
have depleted glycogen stores, and is often seen in the setting of binge drinking,
which may shift the ratio of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), inhibiting gluconeogenesis. They develop an anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of ketoacidosis
and lactic acidosis. They present with the same symptoms of acidosis as do DKA
patients, for example, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but with low, normal,
or slightly elevated glucose levels (in contrast to DKA, in which the glucose level
usually is markedly elevated). Treatment is administration of volume in the form of
NS and glucose solution. Insulin administration typically is unnecessary.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
43.1 Which of the following most likely will lead to a non–anion gap acidosis?
A. Diarrhea
B. Lactic acidosis
C. Diabetic ketoacidosis
D. Ethylene glycol ingestions
43.2 An 18-year-old man is noted to be in diabetic ketoacidosis with pH 7.20 and
serum glucose level 400 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most accurate
statement regarding this patient’s potassium status?
A. Likely to have a potassium level less than 3.0 mEq/L.
B. Likely to have a potassium level more than 5 mEq/L.

diabetic ketoacidosis?
A. Replacement of potassium
B. Intravenous fluid replacement
C. Replacement of phosphorus
D. Antibiotic therapy
43.4 A 59-year-old man with a long history of diabetes with chronic renal insufﬁciency due to diabetic nephropathy is seen in clinic for routine lab work.
He is asymptomatic, but his glucose is elevated at 258 mg/dL, and his other
chemistries are as follows: sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 5.4 mEq/L, chloride
108 mEq/L, and bicarbonate is 18 mEq/L. His creatinine is stable at 2.1 mg/dL.
What is the most likely cause of his acidosis?
A. Diabetic ketoacidosis
B. Lactic acidosis
C. Type 4 renal tubular acidosis
D. Accidental salicylate overdose

ANSWERS
43.1 A. Diarrhea leads to bicarbonate loss and usually does not affect the anion gap.
43.2 C. Total body potassium usually is depleted regardless of the serum level.
43.3 B. The basic tenets of treating DKA include intravenous ﬂuid, insulin to control the glucose level, correction of metabolic disturbances, and identiﬁcation
of the underlying etiology.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

43.4 C. The labs are consistent with a non–anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patients
with chronic kidney disease due to diabetes are prone to subtle volume
expansion and low plasma renin activity, leading to hypoaldosteronism.
Since aldosterone is the major hormone that promotes potassium excretion,
hyperkalemia is the primary electrolyte abnormality. The disorder is typically
associated with a mild metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate usually >17 mEq/L).
The other illnesses cause anion gap acidosis.

CLINICAL PEARLS


All patients with diabetic ketoacidosis are volume depleted and require
significant replacement of salt solution and, later, free water in the form
of glucose solutions.



Despite sometimes elevated potassium concentrations, all patients with
diabetic ketoacidosis have a total body potassium deficit and will require
substantial potassium replacement.



Glucose levels fall more quickly than ketones resolve. Continuous insulin
therapy is necessary for resolution of the ketoacidosis and can be coadministered with a glucose infusion until the anion gap is resolved.



Cerebral edema can result from overly rapid correction of hyperglycemia
or possibly from rapid administration of hypotonic fluids.



Occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis requires a precipitating cause, either
insulin deficiency or a physiologic stressor such as infection.

CASE 44
A 37-year-old previously healthy woman presents to your clinic for unintentional
weight loss. Over the past 3 months, she has lost approximately 15 lb without
changing her diet or activity level. Otherwise, she feels great. She has an excellent
appetite, no gastrointestinal complaints except for occasional loose stools, a good
energy level, and no complaints of fatigue. She denies heat or cold intolerance. On
examination, her heart rate is 108 bpm, blood pressure 142/82 mm Hg, and she
is afebrile. When she looks at you, she seems to stare, and her eyes are somewhat
protuberant. You note a large, smooth, nontender thyroid gland and a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur on cardiac examination, and her skin is warm and dry. There is
a fine resting tremor.

ANSWERS TO CASE 44:
Thyrotoxicosis/Graves Disease
Summary: A 37-year-old woman presents with weight loss without anorexia,
tachycardia, borderline hypertension, exophthalmos, and a smooth, nontender goiter.
• Most likely diagnosis: Thyrotoxicosis/Graves disease.
• Confirming the diagnosis: A low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
level and an increased free thyroxine (T4) level with this clinical presentation
would be confirmatory of hyperthyroidism. However, other tests that would
define the etiology would be thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins or diffusely
elevated uptake of radioactive iodine on thyroid scan.
• Treatment options: Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or less commonly, surgical removal of the thyroid.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the clinical presentation of thyrotoxicosis.
2. Be able to discuss the causes of hyperthyroidism, including Graves disease and
toxic nodule.
3. Learn the complications of thyrotoxicosis, including thyroid storm.
4. Understand the evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule.
5. Know the available treatment options for Graves disease and outcomes of
treatment.

Considerations
This 37-year-old woman has unintentional weight loss, loose stools, and warm
skin, all symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Her thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged and
nontender, and she has exophthalmus (protuberant eyes), which is consistent with
Graves disease. This is a systemic disease with many complications that affect the
entire body, including osteoporosis and heart failure. Treatment can include elimination of the excess thyroid hormone, but definitive therapy may include radioactive (or, less commonly, surgical) ablative therapy.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

385

APPROACH TO:
Hyperthyroidism
DEFINITIONS
HYPERTHYROIDISM: Hypermetabolic condition that results from the effect of
excessive amounts of thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland itself. Because
almost all cases of thyrotoxicosis are caused by thyroid overproduction, these terms
are often used synonymously.
THYROTOXICOSIS: Usually used as a general term for the state of thyroid hormone excess from any source, for example, exogenous ingestion.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hyperthyroidism affects numerous body systems.
Neuromuscular system: Nervousness, tremors, and brisk reflexes are common.
Inability to concentrate, proximal muscle weakness, emotional lability, and insomnia
might be present.
Cardiac system: Wide pulse pressure, flow heart murmurs, and tachycardia usually
are present. Atrial fibrillation is present in 10% to 20% of patients. Long-standing
thyrotoxicosis can cause cardiomegaly and result in high-output heart failure.
Gastrointestinal system: Despite increased food intake, weight loss is common.
Hyperdefecation usually is present as a result of increased gastrointestinal motility,
but diarrhea is rare.
Eyes: Retraction of the upper eyelid as a consequence of increased sympathetic tone
gives some patients a wide-eyed stare. Lid lag might be found on physical examination (sclera can be seen above the iris as the patient looks downward). Exophthalmos is distinctive of Graves disease.
Skin: The skin is warm, moist, and velvety, with fine hair texture and alopecia.
Sweating usually is present as a consequence of vasodilation and heat dissipation.
Reproductive system: Hyperthyroidism impairs fertility in women and may cause
oligomenorrhea. The sperm count in men is reduced. Impotence and gynecomastia
might be present.
Metabolism: Weight loss is a common finding, especially in older patients who
develop anorexia. Many patients develop an aversion to heat and a preference for
cold temperatures.
Apathetic hyperthyroidism: Older patients with hyperthyroidism may lack typical
adrenergic features and present instead with depression or apathy, weight loss, atrial
fibrillation, worsening angina pectoris, or congestive heart failure.

Thyroid Storm
Thyroid storm is a dangerous condition of decompensated thyrotoxicosis. The
patient has tachycardia (>140 bpm), fever (104°F-106°F), agitation, delirium,

386

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

restlessness or psychosis, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. It usually results from longneglected severe hyperthyroidism to which a complicating event (intercurrent
illness: infection, surgery, trauma, or iodine load) is added. Treatment includes supportive care with fluids, antibiotics if needed, and specific treatment directed at the
hyperthyroidism.
• Large doses of antithyroid medications to block new hormone synthesis
• Iodine solution to block the release of thyroid hormone
• Propranolol to control the symptoms induced by the increased adrenergic tone
• Glucocorticoids to decrease T4 to triiodothyronine (T3) conversion

Etiology of Thyrotoxicosis
Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism (80%) and usually is
seen in women, especially between the ages of 30 and 50 years. It is an autoimmune
disease caused by autoantibodies that activate the TSH receptor of the thyroid follicular cell, stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion as well as thyroid gland
growth. In the pregnant patient, these antibodies cross the placenta and can cause
neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The disease might follow a relapsing and remitting course.
Graves disease is marked by goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), thyroid bruit,
hyperthyroidism, ophthalmopathy, and dermopathy. These features are variably
present. Ophthalmopathy is characterized by inflammation of extraocular muscles,
orbital fat, and connective tissue, resulting in proptosis (exophthalmos), sometimes
with impairment of eye muscle function (diplopia), and periorbital edema. Ophthalmopathy can progress even after treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Graves dermopathy
is characterized by raised hyperpigmented orange peel texture papules. The most
common site is the skin overlying the shins (pretibial myxedema). A low serum
TSH will confirm the diagnosis. The degree of elevation of serum-free T4 and free
T3 levels can give an estimate of the severity of the disease. Tests that might
be helpful in determining the etiology of thyrotoxicosis are the levels of thyroidstimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), which is elevated in Graves; thyroid peroxidase
(TPO) antibodies, which are markers of autoimmunity in both Graves and Hashimoto thyroiditis; and a thyroid uptake and scan, which will reveal a diffusely elevated
iodine uptake in our patient.
Treatment options for Graves disease are medications, radioactive iodine, or surgery. Medications include beta-blockers such as propranolol (which are used for
symptom relief) and antithyroid drugs such as methimazole and propylthiouracil
(PTU). The antithyroid drugs work mainly by decreasing the production of thyroid hormone. They can be used for short-term (prior to treatment with radioactive
iodine or surgery) or long-term (1-2 years) treatment, after which the chance for
remission is 20% to 30%. Possible side effects are rash, allergic reactions, arthritis,
hepatitis, and agranulocytosis. Radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in the
United States. It is administered as an oral solution of sodium 131I that is rapidly
concentrated in thyroid tissue, inducing damage that results in ablation of the
thyroid, depending on the dose, within 6 to 18 weeks. At least 30% of patients will
become hypothyroid in the first year after treatment and 3% each year after that,

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

387

requiring thyroid hormone supplementation. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated
in pregnancy, and women of reproductive age are advised to postpone pregnancy
for 6 to 12 months after treatment. Pregnant women with Graves can be managed
with PTU, as it has a low transplacental transfer. Graves ophthalmopathy might
be exacerbated by radioactive iodine treatment, so glucocorticoids can be used to
prevent this in selected patients.
Subtotal thyroidectomy usually is reserved for large goiters with obstructive
symptoms (dyspnea, dysphagia). Possible complications include laryngeal nerve
injury and hypoparathyroidism (due to removal of parathyroids or compromise of
the vascular supply to them).
For our patient, treatment with radioactive iodine or antithyroid medications
seems the most reasonable way to proceed, and a discussion regarding her options
and our recommendations should take place after the diagnosis is confirmed.
Other causes of thyrotoxicosis include the following:
Toxic multinodular goiter: Found mainly in elderly and middle-age patients.
Treatment consists of radioactive iodine or surgery. Radioactive iodine uptake is normal to increased, and the scan reveals irregular thyroid lobes and a heterogeneous
pattern.
Autonomous hyperfunctioning adenoma (“hot nodule” or Plummer disease):
Hyperthyroidism usually is not present unless the nodule is more than 3 cm. The
iodine scan looks like the flag of Japan: it demonstrates the hot nodule as having
increased uptake (dark) and the rest of the gland with suppressed uptake (white).
Hot nodules are almost never malignant. Cold nodules (no increased thyroid hormone production and no demonstration of local uptake if thyroid scan is performed)
have a 5% to 10% risk of malignancy, so fine-needle aspiration, surgical removal, or
ultrasonographic follow-up is needed for these nodules.
Thyroiditis: Caused by destruction of thyroid tissue and release of preformed hormone from the colloid space. Subacute (de Quervain) thyroiditis is an inflammatory viral illness with thyroid pain and tenderness. The hyperthyroid phase lasts for
several weeks to months, followed by recovery, but some patients will then develop
hypothyroidism. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and
beta-blockers usually is sufficient, but in severe cases, glucocorticoids might be used.
Other forms include postradiation, postpartum, subacute (painless thyroiditis), and
amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. In thyroiditis, the radioactive iodine uptake is
invariably decreased.
Medications: Excessive ingestion of thyroid hormone (factitious or iatrogenic),
amiodarone, and iodine load.
Other conditions such as TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, hydatidiform moles,
choriocarcinomas secondary to secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),
ovarian teratomas, and metastatic follicular thyroid carcinomas are rare causes of
thyrotoxicosis.

A. Lymphocytic thyroiditis
B. Hashimoto thyroiditis
C. Graves disease
D. Multinodular toxic goiter
44.2 Which of the following distinguishes hyperthyroidism from thyroid storm?
A. Tachycardia to heart rate 120 bpm

ANSWERS
44.1 C. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United
States. It often includes the thyroid gland features described, as well as the
distinctive eye ﬁndings.
44.2 C. Thyroid storm is an exaggeration of hyperthyroid features with extreme
tachycardia (heart rate >140 bpm), fever, and central nervous system dysfunction, such as confusion or coma. It is a medical emergency with a high mortality.
44.3 C. Radioactive iodine is the deﬁnitive treatment for Graves disease. Surgery is
indicated for obstructive symptoms or for women during pregnancy.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

389

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common cause of thyrotoxicosis is Graves disease. No other
diagnosis is likely if the patient has bilateral proptosis and a goiter.



In patients with Graves disease, thyrotoxic symptoms may be treated
with antithyroid medication or by thyroid gland ablation by radioactive
iodine or surgery, but the ophthalmopathy may not improve.



Graves disease may remit and relapse; in patients treated medically, one-third
to half will become asymptomatic within 1-2 years.



After radioablation, most patients with Graves disease become hypothyroid
and will require thyroid hormone supplementation.



Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules (excessive thyroid hormone production, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, “hot” on radionuclide
scan) almost never are malignant.



Most “cold” thyroid nodules are not malignant, but fine-needle aspiration
should be used to evaluate the need for surgical excision.

CASE 45
A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency room complaining of productive
cough, fever, and chest pain for 4 days. She was seen 2 days ago in her primary
care physician’s clinic with the same complaints, was diagnosed clinically with
pneumonia, and was sent home with oral azithromycin. Since then, her cough
has diminished in quantity. However, the fever has not abated, and she still experiences left-sided chest pain, which is worse when she coughs or takes a deep
breath. In addition, she has started to feel short of breath when she walks around
the house. She has no other medical history. She does not smoke and has no history of occupational exposure. She has not traveled outside of the United States
and has no sick contacts.
On physical examination, her temperature is 103.4°F, heart rate 116 bpm, blood
pressure 128/69 mm Hg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute and shallow, and
pulse oximetry 94% saturation on room air. Physical examination is significant for
decreased breath sounds in the lower half of the left lung fields posteriorly, with
dullness to percussion about halfway up. There are a few inspiratory crackles in
the mid-lung fields, and her right side is clear to auscultation. Her heart is tachycardic but regular with no murmurs. She has no cyanosis. Figure 45–1 shows her
chest x-ray films.

ANSWERS TO CASE 45:
Pleural Effusion, Parapneumonic
Summary: A 32-year-old previously healthy woman comes in with a clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia that has not improved with outpatient
treatment. She has diminished breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the left
side of her chest, suggesting a large left-sided pleural effusion, which is confirmed
by chest radiography. The effusion likely is caused by infection in the adjacent lung
parenchyma and may be the cause of her failure to improve on antibiotics.
• Most likely diagnosis: Parapneumonic effusion as a complication of pneumonia.
• Next step: Diagnostic thoracentesis to help diagnose the cause of the pleural
effusion and to determine the necessity for fluid drainage.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the use of Light criteria to distinguish transudative effusions from
exudative effusions, as a guide to the etiology of the effusion.
2. Learn what pleural fluid characteristics suggest a complicated parapneumonic
effusion or empyema, and the need for drainage.
3. Know the treatment of a complicated parapneumonic effusion that does not
improve after thoracentesis.

Considerations
In this patient, the effusion is large, and if it is free-flowing, which would be evaluated with a lateral decubitus film, then diagnostic thoracentesis can easily be
accomplished. It is important to determine if the effusion is, in fact, caused by the
pneumonia, and, if so, whether it is likely to resolve with antibiotics alone or will
require drainage with tube thoracostomy.

APPROACH TO:
Pleural Effusion
DEFINITIONS
EXUDATE: Effusion caused by inflammatory or malignant causes, usually with
high protein or high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.
PLEURAL EFFUSION: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.
TRANSUDATE: Effusion caused by alteration of oncotic forces, usually with low
protein and low LDH levels.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Diagnostic thoracentesis should be considered for every patient who presents with
a pleural effusion for which the cause is unknown. Possibly the only exception to
this rule is if the patient is known to have congestive heart failure (CHF) with
equal bilateral effusions or if the effusion is too small, that is, less than 10 mm on
lateral decubitus film. If the pleural effusion of CHF does not significantly improve
after a trial of diuresis, however, a diagnostic tap should be performed. Table 45–1
gives the correlations of pleural fluid appearance. Approximately 50 mL of fluid is
needed in order to be visible on a lateral decubitus film (more reliable in detecting
smaller effusions), and fluid volume more than 500 mL usually obscures the whole
hemidiaphragm.
Indications for thoracentesis:
• Uneven pleural effusion or unilateral pleural effusion
• Evidence of infection, for example, productive cough, fever, or pleurisy
• Normal cardiac silhouette (no heart failure)
• Alarming signs, for example, significant weight loss, hemoptysis, or hypoxia
• Need to evaluate underlying lung parenchyma
A simple “diagnostic” thoracentesis can be performed, but if the effusion is
significant in size and the patient is dyspneic, especially at rest, a “therapeutic”
thoracentesis may also be performed, with safe removal of up to 1500 mL. With
removal of more fluid, the patient is at risk for developing reexpansion pulmonary
edema.

Transudate Versus Exudate
To appreciate the pathophysiology of the formation of a transudate versus an exudate is to understand the differential under each category. Approximately 10 mL of
pleural fluid is formed every day by the visceral pleura and absorbed by the parietal
pleura (capillaries and lymphatics). Processes that disturb this “equilibrium” lead to
fluid accumulation. Clinical settings in which the hydrostatic pressure is increased,
for example, CHF and constrictive pericarditis; the oncotic pressure is decreased, for

and connective tissue diseases, which cause a protein leak into the pleural space.
Less commonly, impaired lymphatic drainage, as occurs in chylothorax, or lymphangitic
spread of a malignancy may cause an exudative fluid. Pulmonary emboli can cause
both exudative and transudative effusions. Tables 45–2 and 45–3 list the etiologies
of transudative and exudative pleural effusions, respectively.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Pleural Fluid—Light Criteria: The most widely used criteria to distinguish between
a transudative and exudative fluid are the Light criteria first described in 1997. For
a fluid to be labeled an exudate, it must meet at least one of the following criteria
(transudates meet none of these criteria):
1. Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio >0.5
2. Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio >0.6
3. Pleural fluid LDH >2/3 the upper limit of normal for serum LDH
Pleural LDH correlates with the degree of pleural inflammation and, along with
fluid protein, should always be sent in the initial evaluation.

Parapneumonic Effusions and Empyemas
Pleural effusions occur in 40% of patients with an underlying bacterial pneumonia.
Most of these effusions should resolve with appropriate antibiotic treatment, but if
the fluid characteristics predict a “complicated” parapneumonic effusion, urgent
tube drainage is indicated to prevent formation of fibrous peels, which may need
surgical decortication.
The following fluid characteristics suggest chest tube drainage is necessary:
• Empyema (frank pus in the pleural space)
• Positive Gram stain or culture of fluid
• Presence of loculations
• pH less than 7.10
• Glucose less than 60 mg/dL
• LDH more than 1000 U/L
If the patient does not meet the criteria for immediate drainage, a 1-week trial
of antibiotics is indicated, with close reevaluation of those patients who do not
respond or who clinically deteriorate.
If tube thoracostomy drainage is required, a chest tube is placed until drainage
rate has decreased to less than 50 mL/d. Postdrainage imaging must be obtained
to confirm complete drainage of fluid and to assess the need for placement of a
second tube if the fluid has not been adequately drained (as is often seen if the effusion is loculated). Complete sterilization of the cavity is desirable when treating an
empyema with 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics, as is complete obliteration of the space
by lung expansion. Multiloculated empyemas are treated further by administering
fibrinolytic agents such as streptokinase or urokinase through the chest tube. Videoassisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) is another option for trying to break up fibrinous adhesions.

B. Malignancy in the pleural space
C. Rupture of aortic dissection into the pleural space
D. Pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction

ANSWERS
45.1 B. Congestive heart failure is commonly associated with bilateral pleural effusions, which are transudative, as a consequence of alteration of Starling forces.
The effusions of heart failure are best managed by treating the heart failure, for
example, with diuretics, and typically do not require thoracentesis.
45.2 C. The positive Gram stain, low pH, low glucose, and markedly elevated LDH
all suggest that this parapneumonic effusion is “complicated,” that is, it is
unlikely to resolve with antibiotic therapy and is likely to produce loculated
pockets of pus, which will require surgical intervention. Drainage by serial
thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy is essential.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

45.3 B. The most common causes of hemorrhagic pleural effusion are malignancy,
pulmonary embolism, and tuberculosis. Pulmonary embolism would be suggested by acute onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain rather than this subacute presentation. Similarly, aortic rupture can produce a hemothorax but
would have an acute presentation with pain and hemodynamic compromise.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Transudative effusions meet none of the following criteria (exudative
effusions meet at least one): (a) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio
more than 0.5. (b) Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio more than 0.6.
(c) Pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds normal serum LDH.



Tube thoracostomy or more aggressive drainage of parapneumonic effusion
usually is required with gross pus (empyema), positive Gram stain or
culture, glucose less than 60 mg/dL, pH less than 7.10, and loculations.



The most common cause of pleural effusion is congestive heart failure,
which typically gives bilateral symmetric transudative effusions and is
best treated with diuresis.



The most common causes of bloody pleural effusion (in the absence
of trauma) are malignancy, pulmonary embolism with infarction, and
tuberculosis.

CASE 46
A 25-year-old man presents to your clinic for a general checkup and cholesterol
screening. He denies having medical problems and takes no medications on a
regular basis. He works as a computer programmer, exercises regularly at a gym,
and does not smoke or use illicit drugs. He drinks two to three beers on the weekend. His father suffered his first heart attack at age 36 years and eventually died of
complications of heart disease at age 49 years. The patient’s older brother recently
was diagnosed with “high cholesterol.”
The patient’s blood pressure is 125/74 mm Hg and heart rate 72 bpm. He is 69 in
tall and weighs 165 lb. His physical examination is unremarkable.
Fasting lipid levels are drawn. The next day, you receive the results: total cholesterol
362 mg/dL, triglycerides 300 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 36 mg/dL, and
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 266 mg/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 46:
Hypercholesterolemia
Summary: A healthy 25-year-old man presents for a physical examination and is
found to have markedly elevated total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and low
HDL cholesterol. He has an unremarkable physical examination. He is normotensive
and is a nonsmoker, but he has a strong family history of hypercholesterolemia and
premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD).
• Diagnosis: Familial hypercholesterolemia.
• Next step: Counsel regarding lifestyle modification with low-fat diet and exercise, and offer treatment with an HMG-CoA (β-hydroxy-β-methylglutarylcoenzyme A) reductase inhibitor.
• Complications if untreated: Development of atherosclerotic vascular disease,
including coronary heart disease (CHD).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the risk factors for developing coronary artery disease and know how to
estimate the risk for coronary events using the Framingham risk scoring system.
2. Be familiar with the recommendations for cholesterol screening and for the treatment of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients.
3. Understand how the different classes of lipid-lowering agents affect lipid levels
and the potential side effects of those agents.
4. Know the secondary causes of hyperlipidemia.

Considerations
A young man presents to the clinic for a checkup and is found to have markedly elevated total cholesterol (normal <200 mg/dL) and LDL levels (normal <100 mg/dL),
and low HDL levels (normal >45 mg/dL). He does not have any apparent secondary
causes of dyslipidemia, and has no signs or symptoms of vascular disease. He does
have a strong family history of hypercholesterolemia and premature death caused by
myocardial infarction (MI). The decisions regarding the method and intensity of
lipid-lowering therapy are based on one’s estimation of the patient’s 10-year risk
of major coronary events. Because of his very high lipid levels and family history,
he is a high-risk patient and, thus, should be counseled about lipid-lowering medical
therapy. The very high cholesterol levels at a young age in the absence of secondary causes leads one to suspect familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused
by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and subsequent inability to metabolize
LDL particles. Meanwhile, the importance of lifestyle modification cannot be
overemphasized.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO:
Hyperlipidemia
DEFINITIONS
HYPERLIPIDEMIA: An excess of fats or lipids in the blood, principally due to
either elevated cholesterol or triglycerides.
ATHEROSCLEROSIS: Deposition of atheromatous plaques containing cholesterol
and lipids on the innermost layer of the walls of large- and medium-sized arteries.
STATIN MEDICATIONS: A class of agents that lower cholesterol by inhibiting
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is a key
enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death of both men
and women in the United States. Because of the association of hypercholesterolemia and development of atherosclerotic heart disease, most authorities recommend
routine screening of average-risk individuals at least every 5 years. Clinical laboratories usually measure total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. The LDL cholesterol
may be calculated by using the formula:
LDL = Total cholesterol − HDL − (Triglycerides/5)
A fasting sample should be measured, if possible, but the total cholesterol and HDL
are still reliable in a nonfasting sample. The triglycerides and the calculated LDL levels are affected by recent dietary intake and should be drawn in the fasting state.
Approximately 25% of American adults have a total cholesterol level of more
than 240 mg/dL, which is considered elevated according to the guidelines of the
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Management of patients with
hypercholesterolemia involves assessment of other atherosclerotic risks to estimate
the 10-year risk of coronary events, such as fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction.
The LDL goal is set based on the estimated cardiovascular risk as described in the
2002 Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).
High-risk patients already have an established CHD or other atherosclerotic
vascular disease: their 10-year risk for future coronary events is more than 20%.
The presence of diabetes now is considered a “CHD risk equivalent” in patients
because of their higher risk of vascular disease as well as higher mortality rate from
myocardial infarction than is the case with nondiabetics. High-risk individuals have
an LDL goal of less than 100 mg/dL according to the ATP III. The intensity of lipid
lowering for secondary prevention of CHD in patients with established atherosclerosis is controversial and is evolving. Based on additional studies published after the
ATP III, some authors have proposed lower targets (LDL <70 mg/dL) for patients
in the very-high-risk category: those with established CHD plus multiple major
risk factors such as diabetes or severe and poorly controlled risk factors such as
continued smoking, or a recent acute coronary event.

Cigarette smoking
Hypertension (elevated blood pressure when seen, or patient on antihypertensives)
Low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL)
Family history of premature coronary artery disease (in men <55 y or in women <65 y)
Age of the patient (men >45 y, women >55 y)
Diabetes mellitus

The LDL goal for individuals who do not have established CHD or CHD equivalents (diabetes or other vascular disease such as stroke, peripheral vascular disease,
or abdominal aortic aneurysm) is based on a risk stratification process. First, the
number of risk factors for CHD is counted (Table 46–1). The absolute 10-year risk
for patients with two or more risk factors may be estimated using a scoring system
based on data from the Framingham heart study (Figure 46–1). Patients with multiple risk factors then are assigned to high risk (>20%), intermediate risk (10%-20%),
or low risk (<10%). Those in the intermediate-risk category should have an LDL
goal of less than 130 mg/dL, whereas the lowest-risk patients have an LDL goal
of less than 160 mg/dL.
One should exclude a secondary cause of lipid disorder, either by clinical or
laboratory evaluation. The most common underlying causes of dyslipidemia are
hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus. Other conditions to consider are obstructive liver disease, chronic renal failure/nephrotic syndrome, and medication side
effects (progestins, anabolic steroids, corticosteroids). Very-high-cholesterol levels
in young patients in the absence of secondary causes suggest familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defective or absent LDL surface receptors and
subsequent inability to metabolize LDL particles. Homozygotes for this condition
may develop atherosclerotic disease in childhood and usually require intensive lipidlowering drug therapy.

403

Lowering serum cholesterol levels decrease the risk of major coronary events and
death in hypercholesterolemic patients without a prior history of CHD (primary
prevention), as well as reducing the overall mortality and coronary disease mortality
in patients who have established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention).
All patients should first be educated regarding therapeutic lifestyle changes. These
changes include a diet low in saturated fat (<7% of total daily calories) and low in
cholesterol (<200 mg/d), as well as exercise, which can help to lower cholesterol.
When lifestyle modifications are not enough to reach the LDL goal, multiple
lipid-lowering medications are available. Table 46–2 lists their effects on lipids and
their potential side effects. Statins are generally very well tolerated, but the most
common side effect is myopathy, which may manifest as muscle tenderness with
elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. Low-grade myalgias occur in <10% of patients,
but severe myopathy is reported in 0.5% of statin-treated patients. Less commonly,
elevated liver enzymes, or even severe hepatitis, have been reported. When these
drugs are used, routine clinical or laboratory monitoring for these effects is advisable.
After initiating statins, LDL cholesterol should be checked after 6 weeks, and every
6 to 12 months thereafter, or as the clinical situation dictates.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
46.1 A 35-year-old man with no history of cardiac or other vascular disease asks
how often he should have routine cholesterol screening. Which of the following
is the best answer?
A. Every 3 months
B. Annually
C. Every 5 years
D. Every 7-10 years
46.2 A 38-year-old man presents to your clinic following a health fair screening of
his cholesterol level because he was told that it is high. He watches his diet,
plays tennis, exercises 3 to 5 times per week, and appears to be in good physical
condition. He is a nonsmoker and has no family history of cardiovascular
disease. His proﬁle is total cholesterol 202 mg/dL, HDL 45 mg/dL, LDL 128 mg/dL,
and triglycerides 145 mg/dL. Following a review of this patient’s proﬁle, which
of the following would you recommend?
A. Administer gemfibrozil.
B. Administer HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
C. Administer low-dose niacin and slowly increase to achieve 3 g daily.
D. Suggest he continue his current diet and exercise program.
46.3 Which of the following patients is the best candidate for lifestyle modiﬁcation
alone rather than lipid-lowering medications?
A. A 60-year-old diabetic male smoker with a recent myocardial infarction:
cholesterol 201 mg/dL, HDL 47 mg/dL, and LDL 138 mg/dL
B. A 62-year-old diabetic man: cholesterol 210 mg/dL, HDL 27 mg/dL, and
LDL 146 mg/dL
C. A 57-year-old asymptomatic woman: cholesterol 235 mg/dL, HDL 92 mg/dL,
and LDL 103 mg/dL
D. A 39-year-old man with nephrotic syndrome: cholesterol 285 mg/dL, HDL
48 mg/dL, LDL 195 mg/dL

ANSWERS
46.1 C. The recommended interval for cholesterol screening in this population of
healthy adults is every 5 years. Cholesterol levels do not change rapidly over a
person’s lifetime. A rapid change should prompt investigation for an underlying secondary cause.
46.2 D. In this scenario, this 38-year-old man’s only risk factor for CHD is male
sex; thus, his 10-year risk is less than 10%. His total cholesterol is barely in the
borderline high category, fairly near the desirable level, his LDL is less than
130 mg/dL, and his HDL is acceptable.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

405

46.3 C. Patient A is at highest risk for future events because he has established
CHD and diabetes, he smokes, and he recently had a myocardial infarction.
His goal LDL is less than 70 mg/dL. Patient B has diabetes, a CHD equivalent.
Besides lifestyle modiﬁcations, he should start drug therapy to lower his LDL
and raise his HDL. Patient C has very high HDL, which is protective, and
probably contributes to her elevated total cholesterol. Patient D has nephrotic
syndrome causing hyperlipidemia, which may be treated by reduction of proteinuria using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors but often
requires drug therapy such as statins.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The intensity of lipid-lowering therapy is based on the patient’s estimated
10-year risk for coronary events: high-risk goal low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) less than 100 mg/dL, intermediate-risk goal LDL less than 130 mg/dL,
and low-risk goal LDL less than 160 mg/dL.



The patients at highest risk are those with established coronary heart disease (CHD), and other atherosclerotic vascular disease, such as stroke
or peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes, which is considered a “CHD
equivalent.” The low-density lipoprotein goal for very-high-risk patients
may be less than 70 mg/dL.



LDL cholesterol is the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy; treatment
reduces coronary events and death in patients with and without established coronary heart disease.



The major side effects of statins are myopathy and hepatocellular injury.

CASE 47
A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of acute onset of a right
facial droop, right arm weakness, and some difficulty speaking. These symptoms
started 6 hours ago while he was sitting at the breakfast table. He had no headache,
no diminishment of consciousness, and no abnormal involuntary movements.
Two weeks ago, he had a transient painless loss of vision in his left eye, which
resolved spontaneously within a few hours. His medical history is significant for
long-standing hypertension and a myocardial infarction (MI) 4 years previously,
which was treated with percutaneous angioplasty. His medications include a daily
aspirin, metoprolol, and simvastatin. He does not smoke. When you see him in
the emergency room, his symptoms have nearly resolved. He is afebrile, heart rate
62 bpm, and blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg. The corner of his mouth droops,
with slight flattening of the right nasolabial fold, but he is able to fully elevate his
eyebrows. His strength is 4/5 in his right arm and hand, and the rest of his neurologic examination is normal. He has no carotid bruits, his heart rhythm is regular
with no murmur but with an S4 gallop. The remainder of his physical examination
is normal. Laboratory studies, including renal function, liver function, lipid profile,
and complete blood count (CBC), all are normal. Within a few hours, all of the
patient’s symptoms have resolved.

ANSWERS TO CASE 47:
Transient Ischemic Attack
Summary: A 72-year-old man is admitted because of an acute onset of right facial
droop and right arm weakness, and some difficulty speaking, which resolves within
hours. He denies headache, diminishment of consciousness, or abnormal involuntary movements. Two weeks ago, he had a transient painless loss of vision in his left
eye, which resolved spontaneously within a few hours. He has no carotid bruits, but
he does have a known atherosclerotic disease.
• Most likely diagnosis: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) caused by atheroembolism from the left internal carotid artery.
• Next step: Perform a noncontrast CT of the head.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the most common mechanisms for ischemic stroke: carotid stenosis, cardioembolism, and small-vessel disease.
2. Understand the evaluation of a stroke patient with the goal of secondary prevention.
3. Learn which patients are best managed with medical therapy and which patients
benefit from carotid endarterectomy.

Considerations
Patients who present with acute focal neurologic deficits require rapid evaluation for
suspected stroke. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the brain is necessary to differentiate between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, which cannot
be definitively distinguished clinically. If CT shows no hemorrhage, or a very large
stroke (>1/3 of the MCA [middle cerebral artery] territory), patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic attack may receive thrombolytics (IV recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator) as long as it can be delivered within 3 hours of the
onset of symptoms, with a reduction in mortality and disability.
This 72-year-old man presented more than 6 hours after the onset of symptoms
and has had resolution of neurologic deficits, the hallmark of TIA. He has established atherosclerotic coronary disease but no known carotid artery disease. He
denies headache, which is important because migraine headache may be associated
with neurologic deficits; it would be rare for an elderly man to have the first presentation of migraine headache. Various neurologic diseases, such as multiple sclerosis,
may be characterized by complete resolution of neurologic deficits, but the symptoms usually last longer than 24 hours. He does not have abnormal motor activity,
which would suggest seizure disorder. His evaluation will be focused on secondary
prevention of another, perhaps more devastating cerebrovascular event.
After a noncontrast CT to exclude acute intracranial pathology, secondary prevention of future ischemic events will include noninvasive imaging of the carotid

arteries to determine the extent of stenosis. With these symptoms, if there is more
than 70% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, the possibility of left carotid
endarterectomy should be discussed.

APPROACH TO:
Transient Ischemic Attack/Stroke
DEFINITIONS
AMAUROSIS FUGAX: Transient monocular blindness that often is described as
a gray shade being pulled down over the eye caused by ischemia to the retinal artery.
STROKE: Acute onset of a focal neurologic deficit due to a cerebral infarction or
hemorrhage.
TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA): Transient neurologic deficit secondary to ischemia in a defined vascular territory that lasts less than 24 hours (most
commonly <1 hour).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Transient ischemic attacks, often called “mini-strokes,” refer to the sudden onset
of a focal neurologic deficit, with spontaneous resolution within 24 hours (usually
within the first hour). Not all transient focal neurologic events actually represent
ischemia, however. The differential diagnosis includes classic migraine, postictal
paralysis, seizures, cerebral hemorrhage, or even slow-evolving intracranial processes
such as subdural hematoma, abscess, or tumors, which can suddenly produce symptoms because of edema or hemorrhage or result in seizure activity. However, clinical
evaluation and imaging studies of the brain should be sufficient to exclude most or
all of these diagnoses.
The focal neurologic symptoms produced by ischemia depend on the area of the
cerebral circulation involved and may include (1) amaurosis fugax, (2) hemiparesis,
(3) hemianesthesia, (4) aphasia, or (5) dizziness/vertigo as a result of vertebrobasilar
insufficiency. The significance of a TIA is not the symptoms it produces, because by
definition it is self resolved, but the risk for future events it portends. The highestrisk patients for stroke are those with previous ischemic events such as TIA; that
is, it can be looked upon as a warning sign of impending potential disaster.
TIAs are produced by temporary ischemia to a vascular territory, usually caused
by thrombosis or embolism and less commonly by vasculitis, hematologic disorders
such as sickle cell disease or vasospasm. By far, the most common causes of stroke
or TIA are carotid atherosclerosis (large-vessel disease), cardioembolism usually to
branches of the middle cerebral artery (medium-size vessel disease), or lipohyalinosis
affecting small lenticulostriate arteries (small-vessel disease). Table 47–1 lists the
etiologies of a TIA/stroke.
The workup for a TIA begins with a history and physical examination. Pertinent
historical factors include onset, course, and duration of symptoms, atherosclerotic
risk factors, and relevant medical history (ie, atrial fibrillation). Physical examination should begin with blood pressures in four extremities and should include a

funduscopic examination. In this patient, the first symptom was amaurosis fugax due
to cholesterol emboli, called Hollenhorst plaques, which often can be seen lodged
in the retinal artery. Auscultation for carotid bruits, cardiac murmurs, assessment of
cardiac rhythm, evidence of embolic events to other parts of the body, and a complete neurologic examination should also be assessed.
Laboratory data that should always be obtained include a complete blood count,
fasting lipid profile, and serum glucose level. Other laboratory data, such as an erythrocyte sedimentation rate in elderly populations to evaluate for temporal arteritis,
should be tailored to the patient. Generally, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
must be obtained to evaluate for atrial fibrillation. An echocardiogram can be useful
to evaluate for valvular or mural thrombi. A noncontrast CT scan of the brain also
must be performed initially. Noncontrast CT scans of the brain are very sensitive in
detecting acute cerebral hemorrhage but are relatively insensitive to acute ischemic
strokes, particularly when the area of the stroke is less than 5 mm in diameter or is
located in the region of the brainstem or the storke is less than 12 hours old. Further
imaging with magnetic resonance may be considered.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

411

Finally, imaging of the extracranial vasculature to detect severe carotid artery
stenosis is essential to guide further stroke prevention therapy. Carotid Doppler
ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography are effective noninvasive imaging
studies and are often used as first-line diagnostic tools.
Stroke prevention begins with antiplatelet therapy, and aspirin should be used in
all cases unless there is a contraindication to its use. Use of clopidogrel or combination aspirin and dipyridamole may be slightly superior to aspirin for stroke prevention but at a substantially higher dollar cost. Combination therapy with aspirin and
clopidogrel has not been shown to provide greater benefit in stroke prevention but
does produce a higher rate of bleeding complications. For patients with TIA/stroke
as a consequence of carotid atherosclerosis, medical management includes antiplatelet agents, and aggressive risk factor reduction with blood pressure control, treatment of hyperlipidemia, and smoking cessation. For patients with cardioembolic
stroke as a result of atrial fibrillation, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin
(Coumadin) is recommended. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran has
recently been approved for patients with atrial fibrillation, and is comparable in
efficacy to warfarin. For patients with small-vessel disease producing lacunar infarctions, blood pressure control and antiplatelet agents are the mainstays of therapy.
Surgical endarterectomy for severe carotid artery stenosis has successfully
reduced the long-term risk of stroke in both symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients. The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial
(NASCET) showed that in patients who had suffered a TIA or stroke and had an
ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis greater than 70%, endarterectomy reduced the
rate of stroke from 26% to 9% over 2 years compared with standard medical management. The Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis (ACAS) trial also showed
benefit from carotid endarterectomy in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery
stenoses (those without prior TIA or stroke) greater than 60%. However, the risk
reduction was smaller than in symptomatic patients, from 11% to 5% over 5 years
compared to medical management. It should also be noted that the surgery is not
without risk and can actually cause strokes. In both trials, the stipulation was made
that in order to achieve the risk reduction benefit; surgery should be performed
in a center with very low surgical morbidity and mortality. For asymptomatic
patients, the benefits of the procedure do not begin to exceed the perioperative
morbidity for at least 2 years, so it should be viewed as a “long-term investment” in
patients with relatively low comorbidity and a long life expectancy.
Carotid angioplasty and stenting is another procedure available for patients with
carotid stenosis but, like endarterectomy, also carries a risk of embolization and
stroke. Angioplasty has not been proven to be superior to surgical endarterectomy,
and its exact role is not yet defined. It may be considered as an alternative to surgery
for symptomatic patients, those with previous TIA or stroke, whose surgical risk is
believed to be too high or who are believed to have a high risk for restenosis. It is
not recommended for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

complains of dizziness and vertigo. Which of the following arteries is most
likely to be affected?
A. Vertebrobasilar
B. Carotid
C. Aorta
D. Middle cerebral
47.4 A 62-year-old man who works at an automobile assembly line has noticed
that he feels pain, fatigue, and numbness in his right arm while working for
the last several months. This morning at work, he noticed vertigo, then lightheadedness, then lost consciousness for a few seconds. The blood pressure in
his right arm is 30 mm Hg lower than that in his left arm. What is the most
likely diagnosis?
A. Left middle cerebral artery stroke
B. Lacunar infarction involving right internal capsule
C. Stenosis of right subclavian artery due to atherosclerosis
D. Multiple sclerosis

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

ANSWERS
47.1 C. In this asymptomatic patient, carotid endarterectomy may be considered
for severe stenosis, provided it can be performed in a center with very low
surgical morbidity and mortality, and the patient has a life expectancy sufﬁcient
to justify the perioperative risk.
47.2 D. Multiple neurologic deﬁcits separated in space and time in a young patient
are suggestive of multiple sclerosis.
47.3 A. Vertigo and dizziness can be seen in vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency.
47.4 C. The patient likely has subclavian steal: phenomenon of ﬂow reversal in
the vertebral artery ipsilateral to a hemodynamically signiﬁcant stenosis of the
subclavian artery. The neurologic symptoms can be caused by vertebrobasilar
ischemia.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The most common causes of cerebral infarction are carotid atherosclerotic stenosis, cardioembolism, and small-vessel disease such as
lipohyalinosis.



Cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack, and amaurosis fugax all
may be symptoms of carotid stenosis.



In symptomatic patients with severe stenosis >70%, carotid endarterectomy is superior to medical therapy in stroke prevention provided the
surgical risk is low (<3%).



For other patients, stroke prevention consists mainly of antiplatelet
agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) and risk factor modification, for example,
lowering blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, smoking cessation.

CASE 48
A 25-year-old man comes to an outpatient clinic complaining of low-grade fever
and sore throat, and he receives an injection of intramuscular penicillin for presumed streptococcal pharyngitis. He is otherwise healthy and takes no regular
medications. Within 20 minutes, he begins to complain of swelling of his face and
difficulty breathing. He looks dyspneic and frightened. His heart rate is 130 bpm,
blood pressure 90/47 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute and
shallow. His face and lips are edematous, and he can barely open his eyes because
of swelling. He is wheezing diffusely, and he has multiple raised urticarial lesions
on his skin. An ambulance has been called.

ANSWERS TO CASE 48:
Anaphylaxis/Drug Reactions
Summary: A 25-year-old man develops facial edema and difficulty breathing minutes after receiving an injection of penicillin. He is tachypneic and tachycardic,
with borderline hypotension. He is wheezing diffusely, his abdomen is nondistended
with hyperactive bowel sounds, and his skin is warm with multiple raised urticarial
lesions.
• Most likely diagnosis: Anaphylaxis as a result of penicillin hypersensitivity.
• Next step: Immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine, along
with corticosteroids and H1 and H2 blockers. Close observation of the patient’s
airway and oxygenation, with possible endotracheal intubation if he becomes
compromised.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the clinical presentation and emergency management of anaphylaxis.
2. Understand the diagnosis and complications of serum sickness.
3. Be able to recognize and treat erythema multiforme minor and major.

Considerations
This young man developed manifestations of immediate hypersensitivity, with
urticaria, facial angioedema, and bronchospasm. Penicillin is fairly allergenic
and leads to an immunoglobulin (Ig)E–mediated release of histamines and other
vasoactive chemicals. Epinephrine is the agent of choice in acute anaphylaxis.
Antihistamines may also help. Because the airway is vulnerable to compromise as
a result of severe edema, intubation to protect the airway is sometimes indicated.

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Anaphylaxis
DEFINITIONS
ANGIOEDEMA: Swelling of the lips, periorbital region, face, hands, or feet.
ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS: Similar clinical picture to anaphylaxis but
not caused by immunologic mechanisms.
ANAPHYLAXIS: Syndrome with varied mechanisms, clinical presentations, and
severity that is an acute life-threatening reaction resulting from a type I hypersensitivity reaction: IgE-mediated activation of mast cells. Mast cell degranulation
results in release of histamine, interleukins, and other inflammatory mediators.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

417

CLINICAL APPROACH
Common causes of anaphylaxis include drugs, hymenoptera stings (bees, wasps),
radiographic contrast media (anaphylactoid), blood products, latex in medical products, allergen immunotherapy injections, and foods. The most common cause of
drug-related anaphylaxis is β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin. The most common cause of food-related anaphylaxis is peanuts, partly because of the frequency
with which peanut products are included in other types of foods. However, it is
important to note that almost any agent that can activate mast cells or basophils can
cause an anaphylactic reaction. Approximately, one-third of all cases of anaphylaxis
are idiopathic.
The clinical presentation of anaphylactic reactions varies greatly, but the following guidelines are a good rule of thumb. Symptoms usually develop within 5 to
60 minutes following exposure, although a delayed reaction is possible. Symptoms
and signs are variable and are listed in Table 48–1. The key fact to remember is that
a true anaphylactic reaction is life-threatening. Angioedema may occur with or
without urticaria but is not anaphylaxis unless the reaction is associated with other
life-threatening processes, such as hypotension or laryngeal edema.
Treatment of anaphylaxis begins with first assessing the ABCs (airway, breathing,
circulation). Intubation, if required, should not be delayed. Second, epinephrine
should be administered to help control symptoms and blood pressure. Intramuscular
epinephrine injected in the anterolateral thigh leads to more rapid and higher peak
levels than does either subcutaneous or deltoid intramuscular injection. Additional
treatment measures include placing the patient in a recumbent position, elevating
the legs, administration of oxygen as needed, normal saline (NS) volume replacement and/or pressors as required, and administration of diphenhydramine 50 mg
orally or intravenously every 4 hours as needed (Table 48–2).
Other considerations in the differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis include erythema
multiforme major and minor. Erythema multiforme minor often occurs after herpes
simplex virus (HSV) or other infections. It manifests as urticarial or bullous skin
lesions. The pathognomonic finding is a target lesion, described as a lesion that is centrally inflamed but is surrounded by an area of less inflamed skin. Treatment includes
management of the underlying cause when known, withdrawal of suspected causative drugs, and acyclovir if HSV involvement is suspected. Erythema multiforme

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Table 48–2 • SUGGESTED TREATMENT OF ANAPHYLAXIS
Address ABCs (airway, breathing, circulation); intubate, if needed
Epinephrine either as intravenous solution (1:1000 0.1-0.3 mL in 10 mL of normal saline over
several minutes) or intramuscularly (1:1000 0.3-0.5 mL every 5 min as needed)
Oxygen as needed
Place the patient in a recumbent position, elevate the legs
Normal saline volume replacement and/or pressors as required
Diphenhydramine 50 mg orally or intravenously every 4 h as needed
Other measures
• Ranitidine or other H2 blockers
• Albuterol or levalbuterol for bronchospasm
• Glucagon if the patient is taking beta-blockers
• Systemic steroids to prevent delayed reactions

major (Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS]) is similar to erythema multiforme minor
but is more severe and involves two or more mucosal surfaces. It is also more likely
to be induced by drugs such as sulfonamides or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) than is erythema multiforme minor. Skin findings may include petechiae,
vesicles, bullae, and some desquamation of the skin. If the epidermal detachment
involves less than 10% of the skin, it is considered SJS. If the epidermal detachment involves more than 30% of the skin, it is considered toxic epidermal necrolysis
(TEN). Other symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, arthralgias, corneal
ulcerations, arrhythmia, pericarditis, electrolyte abnormalities, seizures, coma, and
sepsis. Treatment involves withdrawal of the suspected offending agent, treatment
of concurrent infections, aggressive fluid maintenance, and supportive treatment
similar to burn care. Use of corticosteroids is controversial, but they are often
prescribed.
Most drug rashes are maculopapular and occur several days after starting treatment with an offending drug. They usually are not associated with other signs and
symptoms, and they resolve several days after removal of the offending agent. Serum
sickness, on the other hand, is an allergic reaction that occurs 7 to 10 days after primary administration, or 2 to 4 days after secondary administration of a foreign serum
or a drug (ie, a heterologous protein or a nonprotein drug). It is characterized by
fever, polyarthralgia, urticaria, lymphadenopathy, and sometimes glomerulonephritis. It is a type III hypersensitivity reaction, caused by the formation of immune
complexes of IgG and the offending antigen. Treatment is based on symptomatology, as the disease usually is self-limiting. Treatment may include administration of
antihistamines, aspirin, or NSAIDs, and therapy for associated disease.
Finally, several other types of drug reactions do not fit into the categories discussed. Two of the most important types are iodine allergy and anticonvulsant
drug hypersensitivity. “Iodine allergy” is often associated with radiologic contrast
media. Reactions to contrast media are the result of the hyperosmolar dye causing
degranulation of mast cells and basophils rather than a true allergic reaction.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

419

These reactions can be prevented by pretreatment with diphenhydramine,
H2 blockers, and corticosteroids beginning 12 hours before the procedure. There
is no evidence that a history of seafood allergy is related to adverse events from
radiocontrast media. Phenytoin and other aromatic anticonvulsants have been
associated with a hypersensitivity syndrome, characterized by a severe idiosyncratic
reaction including rash and fever, often with associated hepatitis, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, or hematologic abnormalities. The skin manifestation can range from
skin rash to TEN. This is not IgE mediated, and the exact mechanism remains
unclear. Treatment is supportive, and withdrawal of the offending agent.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

Which of the following is the most likely etiology?
A. Lisinopril
B. Soap hypersensitivity
C. Hypothyroidism
D. Acetaminophen
E. Food-related allergy
48.2 An 18-year-old man with epilepsy controlled with medication develops fever,

48.4 A 57-year-old woman with congestive heart failure (CHF) has a positive cardiac stress test. Cardiac catheterization is required to evaluate for coronary
bypass grafting. She states that she has an allergy to iodine. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Desensitization with increasing doses of oral iodine
B. Infusion of diphenhydramine during the procedure
C. Cancel the procedure and proceed to surgery
D. Diphenhydramine and corticosteroids the night before the procedure

ANSWERS
48.1 A. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often associated
with angioedema.
48.2 B. This is a common presentation of hypersensitivity syndrome associated
with aromatic anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital).
Poison ivy is not associated with fever and lymphadenopathy.
48.3 D. He has developed airway obstruction due to an anaphylactic reaction. He
requires intubation and positive-pressure ventilation to maintain oxygenation.
48.4 D. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine, H2 blockers, and corticosteroids
beginning 12 hours before the procedure greatly decreases the reaction to
contrast dye.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Anaphylaxis is characterized by respiratory distress caused by bronchospasm, cutaneous manifestations such as urticaria or angioedema,
and gastrointestinal hypermotility. Patients may die as a consequence
of airway compromise or hypotension and vascular collapse caused by
widespread vasodilation.



Treatment of anaphylaxis is immediate epinephrine, antihistamines, airway
protection, and blood pressure support as necessary. Corticosteroids may
help prevent late recurrence of symptoms.



Serum sickness is an immune complex–mediated disease that may
include fever, cutaneous eruptions, lymphadenopathy, arthritis, and
glomerulonephritis. It usually is self-limited, but treatment may be
necessary for renal complications.



Erythema multiforme minor is characterized by urticarial or bullous
eruptions, often with target lesions, usually following herpes simplex virus
infections. Erythema multiforme major (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) usually
is caused by drugs and includes cutaneous and mucosal involvement.

CASE 49
A 68-year-old woman is noted to have memory loss and confusion. Her daughter
relates a history of progressive decline in her mother’s cognitive function over
the last year. The mother has lived on her own for many years, but recently she
has begun to become unable to take care of herself. The daughter states that
her mother has become withdrawn and has lost interest in her usual activities,
such as gardening and reading. The patient was always a fastidious housekeeper;
however, recently she is noted to wear the same clothes for several days, and her
house is unkempt and dirty. She seems anxious and confused, and she calls her
daughter several times a day, worried that the neighbors, previously good friends,
are spying on her. She denies bowel or urinary incontinence, and she has had no
trouble with headaches or gait instability. Overall the patient has been very healthy,
and she only receives treatment with hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. She
never smoked and drank alcohol only rarely. On examination, her blood pressure is
116/56 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, temperature 98.7°F, and respiratory rate
18 breaths per minute. Her weight is 160 lb and her height is 5 ft 3 in. She is noted to
be well developed, but her affect throughout the examination is rather flat. She
is oriented to person and place, but she is a little confused as to the date. Head,
neck, and cardiovascular examinations are unremarkable. Abdomen is benign.
The extremities are without edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. Neurologic examination
reveals that the cranial nerves are intact, and the motor and sensory examinations
are within normal limits. Cerebellar examination is unremarkable, and the gait is
normal. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) reveals a score of 24 out of 30.

ANSWERS TO CASE 49:
Alzheimer Dementia
Summary: A 68-year-old woman has memory loss, confusion, and fatigue. She is
more withdrawn and is noted to have a flat affect. She is oriented to person and
place, but not to time. The remainder of the examination, including neurologic
examination, is normal. Notable, however, is her low MMSE score.
• Most likely diagnosis: Alzheimer dementia.
• Next diagnostic step: Assess for depression and reversible causes of dementia.
• Probable treatment: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know some of the common causes and evaluation of dementia.
2. Understand the presentation and diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia.
3. Know acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may slow the progression of dementia.

Considerations
In this elderly patient with slowly progressive decline in memory and cognitive
functioning, dementia due to Alzheimer disease is the most likely diagnosis. As
in other cases of major organ system failure (heart and kidney failures), dementia
(brain failure) deserves some investigation into treatable or reversible causes before
assigning a diagnosis such as Alzheimer disease, which is incurable and progressive
and for which no highly effective therapy exists (Table 49–1).

APPROACH TO:
Dementia
DEFINITIONS
DEMENTIA: Impairment of memory and at least one other cognitive function (eg,
language, visuospatial orientation, judgment) without alteration in consciousness,
representing a decline from previous level of ability and interfering with daily functioning and independent living.
ALZHEIMER DISEASE: Leading cause of dementia, accounting for half of the
cases involving elderly individuals, correlating to diffuse cortical atrophy and
hippocampal atrophy with ventricular enlargement. The pathologic changes in
the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease include neurofibrillary tangles with
deposition of abnormal amyloid in the brain.
MULTI-INFARCT DEMENTIA: Dementia in the setting of cerebrovascular disease, occurring after multiple cerebral infarctions, whether large or small (lacunar).

CLINICAL APPROACH
In assessing the patient with dementia, the clinician should strive to answer three
questions: (1) What is the most likely diagnosis? (2) Is any treatable or reversible
condition contributing to the patient’s cognitive decline? (3) What interventions
are available to preserve the patient’s level of function and relieve the burden to
caregivers?
To answer the first question, the most important investigation is the history of
symptoms. If the patient has an acute or subacute onset of confusion or has a fluctuating level of consciousness, the most likely diagnosis is a delirium resulting from
infection, intoxication, or adverse medication effects, or metabolic derangements
such as hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, or hypoglycemia.
If cognitive decline occurs with prominent mood disturbance, then one consideration is depression or pseudodementia. Distinguishing which occurred first is often
difficult because many elderly patients with cognitive decline and a declining level
of independent functioning suffer from a reactive depression. History provided by
involved family members regarding the onset of symptoms or history of prior depression or other psychiatric illness may help establish the diagnosis, and an empiric trial
of antidepressants may be considered.
If the patient has a history of irregular stepwise decline in functioning, especially
if the patient has had apparent stroke symptoms or transient ischemic events or has
a known cardiovascular disease or atrial fibrillation, then multi-infarct dementia is
the most likely diagnosis. This type of vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia in the United States, composing 10% to 20% of dementias.
Other patients with cerebrovascular disease, especially as a result of long-standing
hypertension, may develop diffuse subcortical white matter changes seen on imaging and an insidious rather than sudden stepwise decline in cognitive function. This
condition is often referred to as Binswanger disease.

426

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Other common causes of dementia include cognitive decline as a result of longstanding alcoholism or dementia associated with parkinsonism. Both of these
underlying conditions are readily discovered by the appropriate associated medical
history.
Less common causes of dementia include medical conditions such as Wernicke
encephalopathy resulting from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency resulting from pernicious anemia, untreated hypothyroidism, or chronic
infections such as HIV dementia or neurosyphilis. A variety of primary central
nervous system (CNS) diseases can lead to dementia, including Huntington disease,
multiple sclerosis, neoplastic diseases such as primary or metastatic brain tumors
(although they are much more likely to produce seizures or focal deficits rather than
dementia), or leptomeningeal spread of various cancers.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a potentially reversible form of dementia in
which the cerebral ventricles slowly enlarge as a result of disturbances to cerebral
spinal fluid resorption. The classic triad is dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary
or bowel incontinence. Relief of hydrocephalus through placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may reverse the cognitive decline. Descriptions of the primary
neurologic diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction are listed in Table 49–2.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

427

Once likely diagnoses have been established by history and physical examination,
investigation should be undertaken to look for treatable or reversible causes. The
choice of laboratory or imaging tests is not straightforward because of the numerous, yet uncommon, causes of reversible dementia, so testing is generally low yield.
Tests that may be considered for the evaluation of dementia are listed in Table 49–1.
The American Academy of Neurology recommends routine assessment of thyroid
function tests, a vitamin B12 level, and a neuroimaging study (either CT or MRI of
the brain).
For patients with Alzheimer disease, the average life expectancy after diagnosis
is 7 to 10 years. The clinical course is characterized by progressive decline of cognitive
functions (memory, orientation, attention, and concentration) and the development of psychological and behavioral symptoms (wandering, aggression, anxiety,
depression, and psychosis; Table 49–3). The goals of treatment in Alzheimer disease
are to (1) improve cognitive function, (2) reduce behavioral and psychological
symptoms, and (3) improve the quality of life. Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine
are cholinesterase inhibitors that are effective in improving cognitive function
and global clinical state. Antagonists to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,
such as memantine, are effective in moderate to severe dementia. Risperidone
reduces psychotic symptoms and aggression in patients with dementia.
Other issues include wakefulness, nightwalking and wandering, aggression,
incontinence, and depression. A structured environment, with predictability, and
judicious use of pharmacotherapy, such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) for depression or trazodone for insomnia, are helpful. The primary caregiver
is often overwhelmed and needs support. The Alzheimer Association is a national
organization developed to give support to family members and can be contacted
through its Web site at www.alz.org.

Table 49–3 • CLINICAL COURSE OF ALZHEIMER DISEASE

diagnosed by viewing multiple areas of the brain infarct.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

429

49.3 D. The classic triad for normal pressure hydrocephalus is dementia, incontinence, and gait disturbance; one treatment is shunting the cerebrospinal ﬂuid.
49.4 B. Alzheimer disease typically has enlarged cerebral ventricles and brain atrophy, whereas normal pressure hydrocephalus has enlarged brain ventricles
without brain atrophy.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Alzheimer disease is the most common type of dementia, followed by
multi-infarct (vascular) dementia.



Approximately 5% of people older than 65 years and 20% older than
80 years have some form of dementia.



Depression and reversible causes of dementia should be considered in
the evaluation of a patient with memory loss and functional decline.



Cholinesterase inhibitors are effective in improving cognitive function
and global clinical state in patients with Alzheimer disease. The NMDA
receptor antagonist is added in more advanced disease.

CASE 50
A 59-year-old woman comes to your clinic because she is concerned that she might
have a brain tumor. She has had a fairly severe headache for the last 3 weeks (she
rates it as an 8 on a scale of 1-10). She describes the pain as constant, occasionally
throbbing but mostly a dull ache, and localized to the right side of her head. She
thinks the pain is worse at night, especially when she lies with that side of her head
on the pillow. She has had no nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or other visual
disturbances. She has had headaches before, but they were mostly occipital and
frontal, which she attributed to “stress,” and they were relieved with acetaminophen.
Her medical history is significant for hypertension, which is controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, and “arthritis” of her neck, shoulders, and hips for which she takes
ibuprofen when she feels stiff and achy. On physical examination, her temperature
is 100.4°F, heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 126/75 mm Hg, and respiratory
rate 12 breaths per minute. Her visual acuity is normal, visual fields are intact,
and her funduscopic examination is significant for arteriolar narrowing but no
papilledema or hemorrhage. She has moderate tenderness over the right side of
her head but no obvious scalp lesions. Her chest is clear, and her heart rhythm is
regular, with normal S1 and S2 but an S4 gallop. Abdominal examination is benign.
She has no focal deficits on neurologic examination. She has no joint swelling or
deformity but is tender to palpation over her shoulders, hips, and thighs.

ANSWERS TO CASE 50:
Headache/Temporal Arteritis
Summary: A 59-year-old woman complains of a 3-week history of severe right-side
headaches that are worse at night, when she lies with that side of her head on the
pillow. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and “arthritis” of her neck,
shoulders, and hips, for which she takes ibuprofen. She has a temperature 100.4°F
and normal neurologic and eye examinations. She has moderate tenderness over the
right side of her head but no obvious scalp lesions.
• Most likely diagnosis: Giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA)
• Best next diagnostic step: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the clinical features that help to distinguish a benign headache
from one representing a serious underlying illness.
2. Know the clinical features and diagnostic tests for GCA.
3. Know the clinical features of migraine and cluster headaches and of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Considerations
Although headaches are a very common complaint, this patient has features that
are of greater concern: older age of onset, abrupt onset and severe intensity, and
dissimilarity to previous milder headaches. These are three of the nine factors of
concern for significant underlying pathology outlined in Table 50–1. She is very
concerned about the headaches and is worried that they indicate a brain tumor.
She has no meningeal signs, and her neurologic examination is nonfocal. She has
stiffness and achiness of the shoulder and hip girdles. Together these factors make
the diagnosis of GCA a strong possibility. GCA usually has its onset in patients
aged 50 years or older (females more than males), and involves inflammation of the

medium- or large-size vessels. Her low-grade fever and generalized body aches may
represent polymyalgia rheumatica, which is closely associated with GCA. The diagnosis would be suggested by an elevated ESR, and then confirmed by temporal artery
biopsy. Although GCA is not a common cause of headache, untreated patients often
progress to permanent visual loss as a consequence of involvement of the ophthalmic
artery, so a high index of suspicion is necessary to begin investigation. An elevated
ESR necessitates further diagnostic testing, such as a temporal artery biopsy. In the
meantime, empiric corticosteroids may help prevent complications.

APPROACH TO:
Headaches
DEFINITIONS
TEMPORAL ARTERITIS: Also known as giant cell arteritis (GCA), temporal
arteritis is a common form of systemic vascular inflammation affecting patients older
than 50 years. Medium- and large-sized vessels, especially the superficial temporal
artery, are affected.
BERRY ANEURYSM: A small outpouching that looks like a berry and classically
occurs at the point at which a cerebral artery departs from the circular artery (the
circle of Willis) at the base of the brain. They can rupture, causing subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Headache is one of the most common complaints of patients in the Western world.
It periodically afflicts 90% of adults, and almost 25% have recurrent severe headaches. As with many common symptoms, a broad range of conditions, from trivial
to life-threatening, might be responsible. The majority of patients presenting with
headache have tension-type, migraine, or cluster; however, fewer than 1 in 20 have
significant underlying pathology. Because headache symptoms usually are accompanied by a paucity of associated findings, including those on laboratory examination,
the clinician must depend largely upon a thorough history with a general and focused
neurologic examination as the initial workup. Careful inquiry and meticulous
physical examination, keeping in mind the “red flags” of headaches (see Table 50–1),
will serve the clinician well. Differentiating serious underlying causes of headache
from more benign causes may be difficult. Table 50–2 lists some typical features of
serious causes of headache.
One of the most catastrophic secondary causes of headache is subarachnoid
hemorrhage, usually secondary to a ruptured intracerebral (berry) aneurysm. Up to
4% of patients presenting to an emergency center with severe headache, or the
classic “worst ever headache,” have a subarachnoid bleed. The initial hemorrhage
may be fatal, may result in severe neurologic impairment, or may produce only minor
symptoms such as headache. A high index of suspicion is needed because no
neurologic findings may be present initially, and the patient who will benefit the most

from intervention will often have the mildest symptoms. The first diagnostic study
should be a noncontrast CT scan with thin imaging cuts at the region of the brain
base. This study will be positive in more than 90% of cases on the first day, with
decreasing sensitivity over the next several days. If hemorrhage is suspected but the
CT is negative, lumbar puncture should be performed as soon as possible to assess for
the presence of red cells or xanthochromia (yellowish discoloration of cerebrospinal
fluid [CSF]); this finding indicates presence of bilirubin and differentiates subarachnoid hemorrhage from a traumatic lumbar puncture.
Giant cell arteritis, or temporal arteritis, is a chronic vasculitis of large- and
medium-size vessels, usually involving the cranial branches of the arteries arising

from the aortic arch. The clinical criteria for diagnosis include age of onset older
than 50 years, new onset or type of headache pattern, tenderness or decreased
pulsation of the temporal artery, elevated ESR, and abnormal findings on biopsy of
the temporal artery. The presence of three or more criteria yields more than 90%
sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis. GCA is closely related to polymyalgia
rheumatica, an inflammatory condition characterized by bilateral aching and stiffness
of neck, torso, shoulders, or thighs, with a significantly elevated ESR. Both conditions
probably are polygenic diseases in which various environmental and genetic factors
influence susceptibility and severity. Clinical symptoms may include jaw claudication,
and the most worrisome complication is permanent or partial loss of vision in one
or both eyes, which can occur as an early manifestation in up to 20% of patients.
Temporal artery biopsy is recommended in all patients suspected of having GCA,
and long segments of the artery may require excision in order to find the typical
areas of segmental inflammation. Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice to treat both
polymyalgia rheumatica and GCA, with daily doses of 10 to 20 mg of prednisone for
polymyalgia rheumatica and 40 to 60 mg for GCA. Steroids may prevent, but usually
do not reverse, visual loss. Steroid dosage is gradually tapered, but relapse is common,
as are complications of corticosteroid therapy.
Migraine headache is much more common than GCA but is more variable in
its presentation. It is the most common cause of initial clinic visits for headache
because of its frequency, disabling qualities, and associated multiorgan symptoms.
Migraine attacks are more common in women than in men. Migraine attacks may
or may not have a preceding aura, may be unilateral or bilateral, and may have
either throbbing or nonpulsatile pain, including the neck. They may have cranial
autonomic features such as tearing or nasal congestion, leading to the misdiagnosis
of sinus disease. A number of evidence-based guidelines are available for managing migraine headaches. In general, preventive therapies include tricyclic antidepressants and beta-blockers. Treatment of acute episodes involves the initial use of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed by dihydroergotamine or
sumatriptan if symptoms persist.
Episodic cluster headache is much less common, but it is more easily diagnosed
by its distinctive pattern of periodic attacks of intense, unilateral, periorbital pain
with nasal or ocular watering lasting only minutes to hours but recurring daily over
several weeks or months. Acute attacks can be treated with oxygen or subcutaneous
sumatriptan.

throbbing headache lasting hours to days associated with nausea and photophobia,
but no preceding symptoms and no visual disturbance, occurring once or

ANSWERS
50.1 D. The sudden onset of severe headache with diminution in level of consciousness is classic for subarachnoid hemorrhage. This patient likely had rupture of
a cerebral artery aneurysm, which is associated with polycystic kidney disease.
50.2 E. The presence of white blood cells but no red blood cells in the CSF is
indicative of meningeal inﬂammation, likely due to viral or bacterial infection.
50.3 A. The patient’s history is strongly suggestive of migraine, given its unilateral
and throbbing character, and the associated symptoms of nausea or photophobia. Most patients with disabling headache have migraine. Tension headache
should have none of these features.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Temporal arteritis usually involves one or more branches of the carotid
artery and almost always occurs in patients older than 50 years. Diagnosis is
suggested by an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and confirmed
by temporal artery biopsy.



Visual loss is a common complication of temporal arteritis and can be
prevented by initiation of high-dose corticosteroids when the diagnosis
is suspected.



Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents as a sudden onset of severe
headache and is diagnosed by visualization of blood on a computed
tomographic (CT) scan or by finding red blood cells or xanthochromic
fluid on a lumbar puncture.



Migraine is the most common type of headache for which patients seek
medical attention in a clinic setting. It is essentially a headache with
associated features, whereas tension headache is usually featureless.

ANSWERS TO CASE 51:
Osteoporosis
Summary: A 75-year-old white woman tried to stop her fall using her outstretched
right hand, heard a “snap,” and felt immediate pain. Her medical history is remarkable only for menopause at age 50 years and hypertension that is well controlled
with diuretics. She does have a 50-pack-year history of smoking. She has a swollen,
deformed, right distal forearm and wrist, with limited mobility because of pain, and
good radial pulses and capillary refill in the right fingernail beds. An x-ray confirms
a fracture of the right radial head, and the radiologist notes osteopenia.
• Risk factor for fracture: Osteoporosis.
• Causes of this condition: Decreased bone strength as a consequence of demineralization and increased bone turnover as a result of decreased levels of sex
steroids (estrogen and testosterone), medications, other hormonal conditions,
or diseases of decreased calcium absorption.
• Preventive measures: Several medications are available to increase bone
density, which may decrease the risk of future fractures. Also, her physician
would want to work with her to prevent future falls by limiting unnecessary
medications that may cause instability, making changes in the home environment,
and evaluating her gait, visual acuity, and peripheral sensory system. The patient
should be advised to quit smoking.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the pathophysiology of osteoporosis.
2. Learn the risk factors that predispose both men and women to osteoporosis.
3. Be familiar with the tests used to evaluate bone density.
4. Know the treatment options for osteoporosis.

Considerations
This 75-year-old woman with a fracture after a fall likely sustained the fracture
because of decreased bone density. Her risk factors for osteoporosis are her race,
smoking history, postmenopausal state without hormone replacement therapy, and
thin physique. Osteoporosis puts her at risk for future fractures with substantial morbidity, such as painful vertebral compression fractures or incapacitating hip fractures.
She requires intervention to reduce her risk of fractures as well as her risk of falls.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO:
Osteoporosis
DEFINITIONS
BISPHOSPHONATES: Synthetic carbon phosphate compounds (alendronate,
risedronate, ibandronate) that build bone mass by binding to pyrophosphatase in
bone and by inhibiting osteoclast bone resorption.
OSTEOPENIA: T score between −1.0 and −2.5 standard deviations (SD) below
the mean.
OSTEOPOROSIS: Decrease in bone mass leading to increased bone fragility and
predisposing to fracture of the hip, vertebrae, and long bones, with a defined bone
mineral density (BMD) more than 2.5 SD below the mean of young healthy adults.
T SCORE: BMD comparison against young healthy adults (in standard deviations
from the mean).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Osteoporosis is an important health issue because the resultant bone fractures cause
a great deal of morbidity in chronic pain, loss of independence, and loss of function,
as well as mortality. Risk factors for the development of osteoporosis include a low
peak skeletal density reached in young adulthood, increasing age, loss of steroid
hormone production (menopause or hypogonadism), smoking, nutritional deficiencies,
and genetically low bone density. Approximately 14% of white women and 3% to
5% of white men will develop osteoporosis in their lifetime. The prevalence is lower
in African Americans and higher in Asians.
Osteoporosis can be either idiopathic or a manifestation of another underlying
disease process. Probably the most common form of secondary osteoporosis is
caused by glucocorticoid excess, usually iatrogenic steroid use for an inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. Patients, both men and women, with
rheumatoid arthritis are susceptible to accelerated bone loss with even low doses
of glucocorticoids. Gonadal deficiency is another common cause, which is seen
physiologically in menopausal women but is seen pathologically in women who
are amenorrheic (eg, female athletes such as gymnasts or marathon runners) or as
a result of hyperprolactinemia. Men with gonadal failure for whatever reason also
are prone to develop osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis is a common feature of several endocrinopathies. Patients with
hyperparathyroidism will develop osteoporosis because of increased calcium mobilization from bone. Long-standing hyperthyroidism, either naturally occurring, as in
Graves disease, or as a result of excessive replacement of levothyroxine in patients
with hypothyroidism, will also lead to accelerated bone loss. Malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies are causative and are often seen in patients with malabsorption; for
example, most patients, both men and women, with celiac sprue have osteoporosis.
Certain medications, such as cyclosporine, antiepileptics, heparin, and gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) inhibitors, among others, may accelerate bone loss.

442

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Peak bone density occurs in young adulthood under the influence of sex steroid
hormone production. Other influential factors include genetics, which may account
for 80% of total bone density, adequate calcium intake, and level of physical activity,
especially weight-bearing activity. The type of bone growth at this stage is called
modeling. After skeletal maturation is reached, the bone growth enters a new phase,
termed remodeling, in which repairs are made to damaged bone, existing bone is
strengthened, and calcium is released to maintain serum levels under the influence
of estrogens, androgens, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and various cytokines
and other hormones. The activity of the osteoclasts approximates the activity of the
osteoblasts in that overall bone density remains stable. However, after age 35 years,
bone breakdown begins to exceed bone replacement, and this increases markedly
after menopause as a consequence of increased osteoclast activity.

Diagnostic Approach
The benefits and costs of universal screening for osteoporosis are unclear. Rather,
a targeted approach is advocated. Those with a family history or other risk factors
should be offered screening, as well as patients undergoing a chronic drug (steroid)
therapy that may lead to osteoporosis. Currently, all women older than 65 years
or those who have sustained a fracture before age 65 years are recommended
to undergo BMD testing. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) is the
technique used to define diagnostic thresholds; however, whether the hip, spine, or
forearm is the best site for screening is not clearly established. DEXA scan results
can be expressed as a Z score, which compares BMD to that in persons of the same
age, and a T score, which compares to the young adult normal range. T scores
are more useful for predicting fracture risk. Every 1 SD decrease in BMD below the
mean doubles the fracture risk. As mentioned, osteoporosis is defined as a T score of
−2.5 SD.
Other laboratory evaluations should routinely be considered in patients with
osteoporosis. The serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase
should be normal in patients with osteoporosis, although the alkaline phosphatase
level sometimes is mildly elevated in the presence of a healing fracture. Laboratory
abnormalities should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses for the bone
disease: hypercalcemia in hyperparathyroidism or hypocalcemia in osteomalacia.
If a patient suffers a pathologic fracture, that is, one with minimal trauma, other
diagnoses must be excluded. Osteomalacia is defective mineralization of bone matrix
with accumulation of unmineralized osteoid and is most often caused by vitamin D
deficiency or phosphate deficiency. Patients with osteomalacia frequently have diffuse bone pain and tenderness, proximal muscle weakness, and laboratory abnormalities such as elevated alkaline phosphatase level and low to normal calcium
level. In the absence of fractures, patients with osteoporosis should have no bone
pain or laboratory abnormalities. Both of these disease processes can coexist. A less
common bone disease is Paget disease, which is characterized by disorganized bone
remodeling with a high alkaline phosphatase level causing weakened and enlarged
bones with skeletal deformities. Other important causes of pathologic fracture that
must be considered include malignancy, such as multiple myeloma or metastatic
disease, and vertebral osteomyelitis.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

443

Treatment
Treatment of osteoporosis takes a multifaceted approach. Adequate calcium intake,
1000 to 1200 mg/d for premenopausal women and adult men, and 1500 mg with
400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day for postmenopausal women, leads to decreased
fractures. Estrogen replacement can increase bone density and reduce fracture risk,
as can the use of bisphosphonates, both in combination with calcium and vitamin D.
Bisphosphonates can lead to severe esophagitis and must be used with caution in
individuals with gastric reflux disease. Oral bisphosphonates should be taken on an
empty stomach, with a large quantity of water, and the patient should remain in the
upright position for at least 30 minutes. Intravenous bisphosphonates are now
available that can be infused quarterly or annually. There is some concern about
long-term effects of bisphosphonates, including risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and
paradoxical bone fragility causing atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures. Many
experts recommend a drug holiday after 5 years of treatment for patients with stable
BMD. Estrogens have proven benefit in preventing bone loss and reducing fracture
risk, but the Women’s Health Initiative study demonstrated an increased risk of
venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events with conjugated equine
estrogen. Consequently, postmenopausal estrogen is not commonly prescribed for
this purpose. Selective estrogen receptor modifiers (raloxifene, tamoxifen) are used
for treatment of osteoporosis as well.
Weight-bearing physical activity decreases bone loss and improves coordination and muscle strength, which may prevent falls. Ensuring that patients can see
adequately, that they use a cane or walker if needed, that throw rugs are removed,
that patients have railings to hold on to in the shower or bath, or that they wear hip
protectors can further decrease the risk of life-altering bone fractures.

is most accurate?
A. This patient has osteopenia.
B. Estrogen replacement therapy should be started with an anticipated
rebuilding of bone mass to near-normal within 1 year.
C. Swimming will help build bone mass.
D. Bisphosphonates would reduce the risk of hip fracture by 30%-50%.

ANSWERS
51.1 A. Of the choices, this woman is the only individual with risk factors. Risk factors include white race, age, postmenopausal status, smoking, positive family
history, poor nutritional status, and chronic treatment with a drug known to
predispose to bone loss.
51.2 A. The time of greatest accumulation of bone mass in women is during
adolescence.
51.3 A. The T score is the number of standard deviations of a patient’s bone mineral
density from the mean of young, adult, white women. It is the standard
measurement of bone mineral density used by the World Health Organization.
A score of −2.5 SD is the deﬁnition of osteoporosis. A Z score is the number
of standard deviations from the mean bone mineral density of women in the
same age group as the patient.
51.4 D. Estrogen primarily inhibits loss of bone mass, although it can help to build a
modest amount of bone mass, but also may be associated with increased thrombotic and cardiovascular risk. Weight-bearing exercise, and not swimming, is
important in preventing osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates decrease the incidence
of hip fractures by 30% to 50%.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

445

CLINICAL PEARLS


Bone mineral density screening should be offered to patients with risk
factors for osteoporosis and to all women older than 65 years.



Every 1 standard deviation (SD) decrease in bone mineral density below
the mean of young adults doubles the fracture risk. Osteoporosis is
defined as a T score of −2.5 SD.



Patients with osteoporosis should have normal serum calcium, phosphorus,
and alkaline phosphatase levels. Laboratory abnormalities should prompt a
search for an alternative diagnosis.



Fractures can have a devastating effect on a patient’s quality of life, and
a multifaceted approach through nutritional counseling, home improvements, gait stabilization through exercise and with canes or walkers,
and medical interventions to improve eyesight or with medications to
improve bone density should be offered to patients at risk.



In patients with a pathologic fracture, osteoporosis is a diagnosis of
exclusion; osteomalacia, Paget disease, and metastatic malignancies
also must be considered.

a CT scan of his head on admission that showed no intracranial bleeding. His
hospital course has been uncomplicated, and the only medications he currently
is taking are morphine as needed for pain and subcutaneous enoxaparin for
prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis. This evening he has been agitated and
combative, having pulled out his intravenous (IV) line. He is cursing at the nurses

with a temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate 122 bpm, blood pressure 168/110 mm Hg,
respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturations 98% on room air.
He is awake and fidgety, staring around the room nervously. He is disoriented to
place and time; he seems to be having auditory hallucinations and is brushing off
unseen objects from his arms. On examination, his forehead wound is bandaged,
his pupils are dilated but reactive, and he is mildly diaphoretic. His lung sounds

drinks every day after work.
• Most likely diagnosis: Delirium as a result of an acute medical illness or possibly alcohol withdrawal.
• Next step: Look for serious or reversible underlying medical causes for the delirium. If no other medical problems are identified, based on the patient’s daily
alcohol use, a possible diagnosis is alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to recognize delirium in a hospitalized patient.
2. Know the most common causes of delirium.
3. Understand the management of an agitated, delirious patient.
4. Know the special considerations applicable to an elderly demented patient with
delirium.
5. Learn the stages, treatment, and complications of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

Considerations
This 57-year-old man had been in a normal physical and mental state prior to
hospitalization. He then developed an acute change in mental status, with fluctuating consciousness and orientation, the hallmark of delirium. There are many
possible causes for his delirium: pulmonary embolism, acute electrolyte disturbances, occult infection, central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage or infection,
or drug intoxication or withdrawal. These conditions require investigation before
ascribing the symptoms to alcohol withdrawal because they are potentially very
serious or even fatal. In addition, further investigation to quantify his alcohol
intake is necessary.

APPROACH TO:
Delirium
DEFINITIONS
DELIRIUM: An acute confusional state that is one of the most common mental
disorders encountered in hospitalized or otherwise medically ill patients.
DEMENTIA: Significant loss of intellectual abilities, such as memory capacity,
severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning, usually over a
long period of time.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)
defines delirium as having the following features:
• Disturbance of consciousness with impairment of attention
• Change in cognition or the development of perceptual disturbances, for example,
hallucinations
• Symptoms developing over a short period
• Evidence that the above features are caused by a medical condition, medications,
or intoxicants
One of the earliest signs of a disturbance of consciousness is an inability to focus
or sustain attention, which may be evident as distractibility in conversation. Usually there also is disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle. In alcohol withdrawal, signs of
autonomic hyperactivity predominate, and patients may become hypervigilant and
agitated. As symptoms progress, patients may become lethargic or even stuporous
(arousable only to painful stimuli).
Regarding changes in cognition or perception, patients may have difficulty with
memory, orientation, or speech. It is important to ascertain from family members
whether these impairments were chronic, as in dementia, or developed acutely.
Delirious patients may have hallucinations or vague delusions of harm, but
hallucinations are not a mandatory feature of the condition. Delirium is an acute
process, with symptoms developing over a period of hours to days. Additionally,
the patient’s mental status fluctuates, with symptoms often becoming most severe in
the evening and at night. Not uncommonly, hospitalized patients appear relatively
lucid on morning rounds, especially if mental status is only superficially assessed, but
then the night staff reports severe confusion and agitation.
Finally, delirium is a manifestation of an underlying medical disorder. Sometimes, the underlying condition is apparent. At other times, especially in elderly
demented patients, delirium may be the first or the only sign of an acute illness,
or it may be a serious decompensation or complication of a stable medical condition. Table 52–1 lists conditions that should be considered as causes of delirium. Of
these conditions, the most common are drug toxicity (especially anticholinergics,

sedatives, or narcotics in elderly patients), infection, electrolyte disturbances (most
commonly hyponatremia or hypoglycemia), and withdrawal from alcohol or other
sedatives.
Regardless of etiology, delirium produces a profound disturbance of brain function, and all etiologies are serious and potentially fatal illnesses. Delirium must be
approached as an acute medical emergency. A detailed history, aggressively pursued, is mandatory, and because the responses from these patients cannot be relied
upon, information from family, friends, or other caregivers is essential. A thorough
physical examination with emphasis on neurologic status, clarity of speech, level
of awareness, attention span, facial droop, and weakness of an extremity must be
established because such changes must be carefully and frequently assessed. Basic
laboratory studies should focus on chemical abnormalities (glucose, creatinine,
bilirubin, serum sodium levels) and evidence of hypoxia. The two threatening and
potentially easily reversible conditions—hypoxia and hypoglycemia—should be
immediately investigated and treated.
Delirium in the geriatric population can be the presenting manifestation of any
acute illness, with an incidence of up to 10% on admission and up to 30% during
an acute hospitalization. Causes of delirium in the elderly include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, traumatic
injury, or virtually anything else that precipitates an acute hospitalization. This
is even more of a problem after major surgery; nearly half of individuals (usually
elderly) who suffer hip fractures develop delirium postoperatively.
Persons at any stage of dementia may develop delirium during an acute illness or
injury or with additional pharmaceutical agent(s). Additionally, an acute delirium
may “unmask” an early underlying, undetected dementia. The confused and

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

451

disoriented geriatric patient cannot be dismissed as having one or the other, and the
history on which this differential diagnosis is dependent should concentrate on any
changes in the behavioral status of the patient since the acute event.
The management of delirium is first and foremost the identification and treatment
of the acute underlying illness. Adequate hydration, oxygenation, good nursing care,
and round the clock careful supervision are always the initial measures. Management
of agitation and disruptive behavior is the most challenging aspect of care of the delirious
patient. If no specific treatable problem is identified, physical restraint should be used
as a last resort. Frequent reassurance and orientation from familiar persons or constant
supervision from a nurse or hospital aide are preferable. Agitation with psychotic
symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) can be treated with a neuroleptic such
as low-dose haloperidol. Older patients are more likely to experience extrapyramidal
side effects, however, so newer atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone may be used.
Benzodiazepines have a rapid onset of action but may worsen confusion and sedation.

Alcohol Withdrawal
Alcohol withdrawal manifests as a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from minor tremulousness and insomnia to the most severe form, delirium tremens (DT), characterized by delirium, tremor, and autonomic hyperactivity. The severity of withdrawal
can be assessed using a validated assessment tool, the Clinical Institute Withdrawal
Assessment (CIWA) scale. Risk factors for the development of delirium tremens
include a history of sustained drinking, prior withdrawal symptoms, age older than
30 years, and a concurrent medical illness. Withdrawal can coexist with or mimic
other conditions, such as infection, intracranial bleeding, hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other drug overdose. DT is a diagnosis of exclusion; other
serious diagnoses must be excluded before the patient’s mental status and autonomic
signs are attributed to withdrawal (see Table 52–1).
It is important to understand the temporal course of the spectrum of alcohol
withdrawal syndromes (Table 52–2).
In contrast to other causes of delirium, benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice
in alcohol withdrawal. They can be given on a fixed schedule in high-risk patients
(previous history of DT or withdrawal seizures) to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
If symptoms have already developed, benzodiazepines can be given according to
one of two strategies. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide can be given in high doses until withdrawal symptoms cease and then
the slow clearance of the drug is allowed to prevent further withdrawal symptoms.
Alternatively, shorter-acting agents such as lorazepam can be given as needed, only
when the patient has symptoms. Both strategies are effective. In either case, the key
to successful management is initially aggressive upward titration of dosage until the
patient is heavily sedated but responsive, followed by rapid downward titration as
agitation decreases, usually over 48 to 72 hours. Supportive measures are also important, such as adequate hydration, replacement of electrolytes such as magnesium,
and supplementation with thiamine and other B vitamins in malnourished, chronic
alcoholics to prevent the development of Wernicke encephalopathy.

452

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Table 52–2 • ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS
Stage

Symptoms

Tremulousness Earliest symptom occurring within 6 hours of abstinence, caused by CNS and
sympathetic hyperactivity, often referred to as the “shakes” or “jitters,” and can
occur even when patients still have a significant blood alcohol level. In addition
to the typical 6- to 8-Hz tremor, which can be violent or subtle, insomnia, anxiety,
gastrointestinal upset, diaphoresis, and palpitations can occur. Tremor typically
diminishes over 48-72 h, but anxiety, easy startling can persist for 2 weeks.
Withdrawal
seizures

Also called “rum fits”: Typically generalized tonic–clonic seizures, often occurring
in clusters of two to six episodes, and almost always within 6-48 h of abstinence.
Seen in patients with a long history of chronic alcoholism.

Alcoholic
hallucinosis

Typically develops within 12 h of abstinence and resolves within 48 h.
Hallucinations are most often visual (eg, bugs, pink elephants) but can be
auditory or tactile. When auditory, they are often maligning or reproachful human
voices. Despite the hallucinations, patients maintain a relatively intact sensorium.

Delirium
tremens (DTs)

Most dramatic and serious form of alcohol withdrawal, but occurs in only 5% of
patients with withdrawal symptoms. DT typically begins within 48-72 h after the
last drink and can last several days, often with a resolution as abrupt as its onset.
Characterized by hallucinations, agitation, tremor, and sleeplessness, as well as
signs of sympathetic hyperactivity: dilated pupils, low-grade fever, tachycardia,
hypertension, diaphoresis, and hyperventilation. Delirium tremens is a serious
condition with an in-hospital mortality of 5%-10%, usually from arrhythmias or
infection, which is often unsuspected.

52.3 A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency room for extreme tremors and
auditory hallucinations. Which of the following statements is most likely to
be correct?
A. Auditory hallucinations are unique to alcohol withdrawal and cannot be
caused by a brain tumor.
B. If the serum blood alcohol level is higher than the legal limits of intoxication, these symptoms cannot be alcohol withdrawal.
C. This patient should receive glucose intravenously for possible hypoglycemia.
D. If the patient also has hypertension, fever, and tachycardia, he has a
5%-10% chance of mortality.

ANSWERS
52.1 D. Alcohol and benzodiazepines both interact with the γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) system; thus, benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for treatment
of acute alcohol withdrawal.
52.2 A. Fluctuating levels of alertness and consciousness are typical of delirium.
52.3 D. DT with autonomic instability and sympathetic overactivity is associated
with a 5%-10% mortality. Auditory hallucinations can occur from a number of
illicit agents or even brain tumors. The fall in serum blood alcohol level and
not the absolute level may induce symptoms of withdrawal. An individual who
abuses alcohol should ﬁrst be given thiamine, before glucose is administered,
to prevent acute Wernicke encephalopathy.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Delirium is characterized by acute onset of impaired attention and
cognition, and fluctuating levels of consciousness, often with psychomotor
and autonomic hyperactivity.



Delirium requires urgent investigation to search for serious underlying
systemic or metabolic causes.



Frequent reassurance and orientation and constant observation are useful in managing the agitated delirious patient. Low-dose haloperidol can
be used to control agitation or psychotic symptoms. Physical restraint is
used as a last resort.



Delirium tremens is the most severe and dramatic form of alcohol withdrawal, with abrupt onset from 2 to 4 days after cessation of drinking and
sudden resolution several days later, and is associated with a mortality
rate of 5%-10%.



Therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndromes includes benzodiazepines,
hydration, electrolyte replacement, and B vitamins to prevent Wernicke
encephalopathy.

CASE 53
A 66-year-old woman comes in for a routine physical examination. She volunteers
that her menopause occurred at age 51 years and that she is currently taking an
estrogen pill along with a progestin pill each day. The medical history is unremarkable. Her family history includes one maternal cousin with ovarian cancer.
On examination, she is found to have blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate
70 bpm, and temperature 98°F. Her weight is 140 lb, and her height is 5 ft 4 in.
The thyroid is normal to palpation. Breast examination reveals no masses or
discharge. Abdominal, cardiac, and lung evaluations are within normal limits. Pelvic
examination shows a normal multiparous cervix, a normal-size uterus, and no
adnexal masses. She had undergone a mammogram 3 months previously. The
patient states that she has regular Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, and that the last
one performed 1 year ago was normal.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS TO CASE 53:
Health Maintenance
Summary: A 66-year-old woman presents for health maintenance. A mammogram
had been performed 3 months previously.
• Next step: Each of the following should be performed: stool for occult blood or
colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, pneumococcal vaccine, influenza vaccine, tetanus
vaccine (if not within 10 years), cholesterol screening, fasting blood glucose.
• Most common cause of mortality: Cardiovascular disease.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand which health maintenance studies should be performed for a patient
older than 65 years.
2. Know the most common cause of mortality in a woman in this age group.
3. Understand that preventive maintenance consists of immunizations, cancer
screening, and screening for common diseases.

Considerations
The approach to health maintenance consists of three parts: (1) cancer screening,
(2) immunizations, and (3) addressing common diseases for the particular patient
group. For a 66-year-old woman, this includes annual mammography for breast
cancer screening, colon cancer (annual stool for occult blood and either periodic
colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy), tetanus booster every 10 years, pneumococcal
vaccine, and yearly influenza immunization. Screening for hypercholesterolemia
every 5 years up to age 75 years and fasting blood glucose levels every 3 years also
are recommended. Finally, the most common cause of mortality is cardiovascular
disease. Cervical cancer screening can be stopped at age 65 or 70 years if all previous
Pap smears have been normal.

APPROACH TO:
Health Maintenance
DEFINITIONS
COST-EFFECTIVENESS: Comparison of resources expended (dollars) in an
intervention versus the benefit, which may be measured in life-years or qualityadjusted life-years.
PRIMARY PREVENTION: Identifying and modifying risk factors in subjects
who have never had the disease of concern.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

457

SCREENING TEST: Device used to identify asymptomatic disease in the hope
that early detection will lead to an improved outcome. An optimal screening test
has high sensitivity and specificity, is inexpensive, and is easy to perform.
SECONDARY PREVENTION: Actions taken to reduce the morbidity or mortality
once a disease has been diagnosed.

CLINICAL APPROACH
When the patient does not have an apparent disease or complaint, the goal of medical
intervention is prevention of disease. One method of targeting diseases is according
to the patient’s age. For example, the most common cause of death in a 16-year-old
is motor vehicle accidents; hence, the teenage patient is well served by the physician
encouraging her to wear seat belts and to avoid alcohol intoxication when driving.
In contrast, a 56-year-old woman is most likely to die of cardiovascular disease, so
the physician might focus on exercise and weight loss, and screen for hyperlipidemia.
Additionally, physicians should seek to identify high-risk behaviors in a nonjudgmental fashion and promote lifestyle modification: Patients should be screened for
tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use. They should be advised to quit smoking and
limit alcohol consumption to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day
for men. Adjuvant pharmacologic agents are more successful in tobacco cessation,
including bupropion and varenicline. Patients with a history of intravenous (IV)
drug use should be offered testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
hepatitis C. Screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) should be offered to
patients based on their risk factors. Annual screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia
is recommended for all sexually active women 25 years and younger. Overweight
(BMI >25) and obese (BMI >30) patients should be advised to lose weight through
diet modification and exercise. Obesity can lead to numerous complications including
diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, menstrual irregularities, osteoarthritis, sleep
apnea and respiratory difficulties, and hyperlipidemia.
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides recommendations
for evidence-based screening (Table 53–1). These are population-based guidelines,
and it is important to consider family history and social history to identify individuals with special risks.
There is always some degree of controversy surrounding population-based
screening guidelines. For instance, annual mammography is no longer recommended
for women aged 40 to 49 years, mainly based on the low incidence of cancer in this
age group. In addition, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for men to screen for
prostate cancer is not recommended by the USPSTF, though it is recommended by
other groups such as the American Cancer Society.
In addition to these guidelines, there are other recommendations that can guide
clinical practice. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend a single dose of zoster vaccine for adults aged >60 years, but this has not yet
been addressed by the USPSTF.
With advancing age and shorter life expectancy, it is reasonable to cease some
screening activities, though there are limited data on when to discontinue screening. It is generally recommended, for instance, that Pap smears can be discontinued

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
53.1 A 59-year-old woman is being seen for a health maintenance appointment. She
has not seen a doctor for over 10 years. She had undergone a total hysterectomy
for uterine ﬁbroids 12 years ago. The patient takes supplemental calcium. The
physician orders a fasting glucose level, lipid panel, mammogram, colonoscopy,
and a Pap smear of the vaginal cuff. Which of the following statements is most
accurate regarding the screening for this patient?
A. The Pap smear of the vaginal cuff is unnecessary.
B. In general, colon cancer screening should be initiated at age 60 but this
patient has very sporadic care; therefore colonoscopy is reasonable.
C. Because the patient takes supplemental calcium, a DEXA scan is not needed.
D. Pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended.

53.2 A 63-year-old man has had annual health maintenance appointments and
has followed all the recommendations offered by his physician. The physician
counsels him about varicella zoster vaccine. Which of the following is the
most accurate statement about this vaccine?
A. This vaccine is recommended for patients who are aged 65 and older.
B. This vaccine is not recommended if a patient has already developed
shingles.
C. This vaccine is a live attenuated immunization.
D. This vaccine has some cross-reactivity with herpes simplex virus and
offers some protection against HSV.
53.3 An 18-year-old woman is being seen for a health maintenance appointment.
She has not had a Pap smear previously. She currently takes oral contraceptive pills. She began sexual intercourse 6 months previously. Which of the
following statements is most accurate regarding health maintenance for this
individual?
A. A Pap smear should not be performed in this patient at this time.
B. The HPV vaccine should be administered only if she has a history of
genital warts.
C. The most common cause of mortality for this patient would be suicide.
D. Hepatitis C vaccination should be offered to this patient.

ANSWERS
53.1 A. Cervical cytology of the vaginal cuff is unnecessary when the hysterectomy
was for benign indications (not cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer) and when
there is no history of abnormal Pap smears. Colon cancer screening is generally
started at age 50. DEXA scan for osteoporosis is recommended for women starting
at age 65, or earlier for women with elevated fracture risk. Pneumococcal vaccine
is generally given at age 65.
53.2 C. The varicella zoster vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, recommended
for individuals aged 60 and above, and has been shown to greatly reduce
the incidence of herpes zoster (shingles) and the severity and likelihood of
postherpetic neuralgia. It has no efﬁcacy in preventing HSV.
53.3 A. Cervical cytology should be deferred until age 21 or 3 years after initiation
of sexual intercourse. This is due to the fact that adolescents many times will
clear the HPV infection and cause an abnormal Pap smear to normalize. The
ACIP recommends that the HPV vaccine should be recommended to both
males and females between the age of 9 and 26. The most common cause
of mortality for adolescent females is motor vehicle accidents. The hepatitis
C vaccine is currently not available, but hopefully in several years, it may be
developed.

CASE 54
You are the intern on call in the hospital when the emergency room resident calls
up a new admission. She describes an 84-year-old Alzheimer patient who was
brought to the emergency room by ambulance from her long-term care facility for
increased confusion, combativeness, and fever. Her medical history is significant
for Alzheimer disease and well-controlled hypertension; otherwise she has been
very healthy. The resident states that the patient is “confused” and combative with
staff, which, per her family, is not her baseline mental status. Her temperature is
100.5°F, heart rate 130 bpm, blood pressure 76/32 mm Hg, respiratory rate
24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturations 95% on room air. On examination,
she is lethargic but agitated when disturbed, her neck veins are flat, her lung fields
are clear, and her heart rhythm is tachycardic but regular with no murmur or gallops.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable and her extremities are warm and pink.
After administration of 2 L of normal saline over 30 minutes, her blood pressure is
now 95/58 mm Hg, and the initial laboratory work returns. Her white blood cell count
(WBC) is 14,000/mm3, with 67% neutrophils, 3% bands, and 24% lymphocytes.
No other abnormalities are noted. Chest x-rays obtained in the emergency room are
normal. Urinalysis shows 2+ leukocyte esterase, negative nitrite, and trace blood.
Microscopy shows 20 to 50 white blood cells per high-power field, 0 to 3 red blood
cells (RBCs), and many bacteria.

ANSWERS TO CASE 54:
Urosepsis in the Elderly
Summary: An 84-year-old woman, a nursing home resident with Alzheimer disease,
is brought to the emergency room for agitation and confusion. She is found to be
febrile, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Examination shows flat neck veins, clear lung
fields, and no cardiac murmur or gallops; her extremities are warm and well perfused.
Her hemodynamic status has improved with a fluid bolus. Laboratory examination
shows evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI).
• Most likely diagnosis: Shock, most likely as a consequence of urosepsis.
• Next step: Continued administration of blood pressure support with intravenous (IV) fluids or vasopressors as necessary. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should
be started as soon as possible.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know how to diagnose a UTI.
2. Know effective treatments for UTI.
3. Recognize and know how to manage asymptomatic bacteriuria.
4. Know how to recognize and treat septic shock.

Considerations
In this patient presenting with shock, that is, hypotension leading to inadequate
tissue perfusion, it is essential to try to determine the underlying cause and, thus,
appropriate treatment. She has no history of hemorrhage or extreme volume
losses, so hypovolemic shock is unlikely. She has flat neck veins and clear lung
fields, suggesting she does not have right- or left-heart failure, respectively, so
cardiogenic shock (eg, after a myocardial infarction) seems unlikely. Additionally,
both hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock typically cause profound peripheral
vasoconstriction, resulting in cold clammy extremities. This patient’s extremities
are warm and well perfused (inappropriately so) despite serious hypotension, suggesting
a distributive form of shock. With the elevated white blood cell count with immature
forms as well as the urine findings, septic shock as a consequence of UTI seems most
likely.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

463

APPROACH TO:
Suspected Urosepsis
DEFINITIONS
ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA: Condition in which urine Gram stain or
culture is positive, but no clinical signs or symptoms of infection are present.
SHOCK: Clinical syndrome due to inadequate tissue perfusion. Hypoperfusion
leads to cellular dysfunction, release of inflammatory mediators, and ultimately,
multiple organ failure. Most common causes: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, septic.
SEPSIS: A clinical syndrome due to severe infection, characterized by fever,
tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. When an identical clinical syndrome
complicates a noninfectious insult, it is called systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS).

CLINICAL APPROACH
UTIs are a common affliction of the elderly, affecting both debilitated and healthy
adults. UTIs are second only to respiratory infections as the most common infections
in patients older than 65 years. Risk factors that contribute to the high incidence of
UTIs in the elderly as well as in institutionalized patients include incontinence, a
history of prior UTIs, neurologic impairment, immunosuppression, poor nutrition,
and comorbid disease states. These conditions may confer functional abnormalities
within the urinary tract or altered defenses against infection. Furthermore, frequent
hospitalizations expose these patients to nosocomial pathogens and invasive instrumentation such as indwelling catheters.
UTIs typically are diagnosed based on a combination of symptoms and urinary
findings. In symptomatic patients, bacteria typically are found in high concentrations in the urine, and 105 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL typically are
recovered from a clean-catch specimen. If the specimen is obtained by catheterization,
finding more than 102 CFU/mL is considered significant. In women with symptoms
of acute cystitis, urine cultures are often not obtained, but empiric treatment can
be initiated based on the dipstick findings of leukocyte esterase (used as a marker
for pyuria) or nitrites (used as a marker for bacteriuria).
Most UTIs occur as one of three clinical syndromes: acute uncomplicated cystitis
(lower tract infection), acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (upper tract infection),
or catheter-associated UTI (in hospitalized or institutionalized patients). Symptoms
of cystitis reflect bladder irritation and generally include dysuria, frequency, urgency,
or hematuria. Pyelonephritis typically presents with systemic symptoms such as
fever, chills, or nausea, flank pain, and finding of WBC casts on urinalysis. Catheterassociated UTI can be diagnosed by fever, suprapubic pain, or other symptoms
attributable to infection, along with a positive urine culture as defined above.
Another common clinical finding that deserves mention is asymptomatic
bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is characterized by positive urine cultures
without clinical symptoms. Outside of pregnancy or immunocompromised patients

464

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

such as transplant recipients, no adverse clinical outcomes have been reported
as a result of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and no benefits of treatment have been
demonstrated.
Although in younger patients fever, dysuria, urgency, or flank pain may be presenting symptoms for a UTI, elderly and institutionalized patients often present with
less obvious symptoms. These patients may be febrile or hypothermic. Common
manifestations include confusion or combativeness. Mental status or behavioral
changes in the elderly should be considered strong indicators for serious illness,
and a thorough workup should consider etiologies beyond infections. Even with
localizing symptoms suggestive of a UTI, other sources of infection should still be
investigated. Both urine and blood cultures should be sent in addition to a urinalysis
and complete blood count. The results of the urine and blood cultures may take 2 to
3 days to yield an organism. If the clinical picture suggests a UTI, antibiotic treatment should not await these results and should be initiated immediately.
Empiric antimicrobial therapy can be directed at the most common pathogens
(see Table 54–1).
For uncomplicated cystitis, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
(Bactrim), fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin are acceptable first-line therapy and are typically given for 3 days. Empiric therapy should be
guided by knowledge of local antibiotic resistance patterns. Similar empiric treatment may be initiated for pyelonephritis, but urine cultures should be obtained.
Treatment is then guided by culture results, and should be continued for 10 to 14
days. Catheter-associated UTI can only be diagnosed with positive cultures (the
sample should be obtained from a new catheter, or the catheter port, but not the
drainage bag), and antibiotic therapy is tailored to the identified pathogen. If possible, the catheter should be removed or replaced.
The elderly and institutionalized patients commonly acquire gram-positive and
mixed infections, so broad-spectrum antibiotics pending culture results are recommended. In patients presenting with a clinical picture of sepsis, broad-spectrum
antibiotic coverage against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms including
Table 54–1 • ETIOLOGIES OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

antipseudomonal activity is recommended until cultures are available to guide therapy.
The duration of therapy should be dictated by the patient’s clinical status. In
cases where UTIs have progressed to bacteremia, aggressive and prompt treatment
is necessary to prevent the onset of septic shock. This life-threatening state may
develop with little warning in elderly and institutionalized patients with multiple
comorbidities, as it did in the patient in the scenario, who presents with hypotension
and altered mental status because of infection, that is, in septic shock.
Shock is the clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. It
can be classified in a variety of ways, but one useful schema divides the causes into
hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock, usually caused by sepsis.
Hypovolemic shock is the most common form. It results from either hemorrhage
or profound vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in loss of 20% to 40% of blood volume.
Cardiogenic shock results from a primary cardiac insult, such as a myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or end-stage heart failure such that the heart no longer pumps
effectively. Both hypovolemic and cardiogenic shocks cause a marked fall in cardiac output and may appear clinically similar with tachycardia, hypotension, and
cold clammy extremities. It is essential to differentiate between the two, however,
because the treatments are markedly different. Patients with hypovolemic shock
should have flat neck veins and clear lung fields; those with cardiogenic shock
are more likely to have markedly elevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary
edema. Treatment of hypovolemic shock is aggressive volume resuscitation, either with
crystalloid solution or with blood products as necessary. Treatment of cardiogenic
shock focuses on maintaining blood pressure with dopamine or norepinephrine
infusions, relief of pulmonary edema with diuretics, and reducing cardiac afterload,
for example, with an intra-aortic balloon pump.
Distributive shock, in contrast, is characterized by an increase in cardiac output
but an inability to maintain systemic vascular resistance, that is, there is inappropriate vasodilation. Clinically, it appears different than the other forms of shock in
that, despite the hypotension, the extremities are warm and well perfused, at least
initially. If septic shock continues, cardiac output falls as a consequence of myocardial
depression, multiorgan dysfunction ensues, and intense vasoconstriction occurs in
an attempt to maintain blood pressure, the so-called “cold phase.” These findings
portend a poor prognosis; hence, prompt recognition of septic shock in the early
(warm) phase is paramount.
Although distributive shock may occur in neurogenic shock as a consequence
of spinal cord injury or adrenal crisis, the most common cause is septic shock,
most commonly from gram-negative sepsis. Gram-negative organisms may release
endotoxins, which cause a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and cardiac contractility. The initial treatment is isotonic fluid resuscitation to maintain blood pressure. Other cornerstones of therapy include broad-spectrum antibiotics to attack
the underlying infection and removal of the infection source. Patients often require
vasopressor support (norepinephrine and dopamine are the agents of choice) and
mechanical ventilation to optimize tissue oxygenation. Intravenous hydrocortisone
is administered to patients with hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation
and vasopressors. Recombinant activated protein C (aPC) may be considered in
patients with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction assessed to be at high risk of death.

466

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

SIRS is the excessive inflammatory response to a noninfectious cause, such as
acute pancreatitis, thromboembolism, burns, or surgery, and is clinically identical
to sepsis (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis), and may also progress to
shock and organ dysfunction.
Septic shock is associated with high 30-day mortality rates exceeding 50%. Early
diagnosis and prompt treatment are imperative because untreated shock progresses to
an irreversible point that is refractory to volume expansion and other medical therapies.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

467

ANSWERS
54.1 B. All of these patients are asymptomatic, and no beneﬁt from treatment in
terms of reduction in symptomatic UTIs or hospitalization has been shown
for any of the other cases mentioned, except for pregnancy. Treatment is
undertaken to prevent upper tract infection, preterm delivery, and possible
fetal loss.
54.2 C. The patient in this scenario has symptoms of upper tract infection, for
example, pyelonephritis, and is moderately ill with nausea. She will need a
14-day course of treatment and may not be able to take oral antibiotics initially, so hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics likely will
be necessary. Single-dose and 3-day regimens are useful only for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. E coli is frequently resistant to ampicillin.
54.3 C. The patient is hypotensive with signs of left- and right-heart failure, that is,
probably cardiogenic shock. Septic shock and adrenal crisis both are forms of
distributive shock that would produce warm extremities. Hypovolemic shock
should have ﬂat neck veins and no pulmonary edema.
54.4 D. When septic shock is refractory to volume resuscitation, then vasopressors
such as dopamine or norepinephrine are generally the next step. Corticosteroids can be administered empirically if hypotension is refractory to pressors.
Intravenous morphine might lower his blood pressure further. FFP is used
when the patient shows evidence of coagulopathy such as disseminated intravascular coagulation.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Urinary tract infections and pneumonia are the most common causes of
sepsis in older patients.



Urinary tract infections can be diagnosed by the presence of urinary
symptoms and by more than 105 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL in
a clean-catch specimen and more than 102 CFU/mL in a catheterized
specimen.



In healthy women with symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis,
cultures are not routinely sent, and treatment can be initiated based on
symptoms and on a urine dipstick finding of leukocyte esterase or nitrites.



Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common finding among elderly patients
and requires no treatment; it is only routinely treated in pregnancy and in
transplant recipients.



Sepsis (infectious) and SIRS (noninfectious) are syndromes characterized
by fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. They require early and
aggressive intervention to prevent clinical deterioration to shock.

CASE 55
A 38-year-old man without a significant medical history presents for an office
evaluation. He reports a 9 to 12-month history of intermittent diarrhea, associated with some mild cramping. He says the stools are usually large in volume, are
nonbloody, and sometimes look greasy. He has lost more than 20 lb during this
period without trying, but says that his appetite and oral intake have been good.
He has tried taking a proton pump inhibitor daily for the last several months, but
it has not improved his symptoms. He also tried refraining from any intake of dairy
products, but that did not affect the diarrhea, either. He has not experienced
fever or any other constitutional symptoms. He does not smoke and drinks an
occasional beer on the weekends, but not regularly. He is married and monogamous,
and he was adopted and does not know his family medical history.
On examination, he is afebrile and normotensive and comfortable appearing.
He has some glossitis, but no other oral lesions. His chest is clear to auscultation,
and his heart is regular in rate and rhythm. On abdominal examination, his bowel
sounds are active and there is no tenderness, and no masses or organomegaly.
Rectal examination is negative for occult blood. He has a few papulovesicular
lesions on his elbows and knees with some excoriations.

ANSWERS TO CASE 55:
Chronic Diarrhea
Summary: A 38-year-old man presents with chronic diarrhea, which he describes
as nonbloody, but sometimes greasy, suggestive of fat malabsorption. He has experienced unintentional weight loss. There has been no fever or other systemic symptoms
to suggest an infectious or inflammatory process. He has glossitis on examination,
which is concerning for deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, or other vitamin B. The
rash on his extensor surfaces is consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis, which is
strongly associated with celiac disease.
• Most likely diagnosis: Chronic diarrhea due to celiac disease.
• Best diagnostic test: Endoscopic examination with small bowel biopsy.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the initial evaluation and management of acute infectious diarrhea.
2. Know the indications for antibiotic treatment of acute diarrhea.
3. Be able to evaluate patients with chronic diarrhea and understand pathophysiologic mechanisms.
4. Understand the diagnosis, management, and complications of celiac disease.

Considerations
This patient presents with chronic diarrhea with worrisome features (weight loss,
probable malabsorption with nutritional deficiency). It is important to distinguish
between functional causes of chronic diarrhea, such as irritable bowel syndrome,
and more significant causes of diarrhea (inflammatory diseases, malabsorption from
whatever cause, or underlying systemic disease) that may lead to complications or
adverse long-term sequelae. Celiac disease is an important diagnosis to consider, as
the clinical manifestations may be subtle, but once a diagnosis is established, most
patients can be managed with dietary modification to improve symptoms and prevent
complications.

APPROACH TO:
Diarrhea
DEFINITIONS
DIARRHEA: Passage of abnormally liquid or unformed stool at increased frequency.
ACUTE DIARRHEA: Diarrhea of less than 14-day duration.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

471

CHRONIC DIARRHEA: Diarrhea of more than 4-week duration (may be termed
persistent diarrhea if symptoms continue for 2 to 4 weeks).
CELIAC DISEASE: Small bowel disorder of uncertain etiology characterized by
symptoms of malabsorption, and an abnormal small bowel biopsy, which occurs with
exposure to dietary gluten and improves after elimination of gluten from the diet.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Acute Diarrhea
Diarrheal illnesses are extremely common, affecting nearly one in three people in
the United States each year. In developing countries, acute infectious diarrhea is
one of the leading causes of mortality. In the developed world, 90% of cases of
acute diarrhea are infectious, but the large majority of those illnesses are mild
and self-limited. High-risk groups include travelers, immunocompromised patients,
and patients who are hospitalized or institutionalized, but those groups are outside
the scope of this discussion.
Most patients with mild to moderate illness do not require specific evaluation,
and their symptoms can be managed with an oral sugar-electrolyte solution, or with
antimotility agents such as loperamide. Bismuth subsalicylate can also reduce symptoms of nausea and diarrhea.
A more severe illness is suggested by any of the following findings: profuse
watery diarrhea with signs of hypovolemia, grossly bloody stools, fever, symptoms
>48 hours, severe abdominal pain, age >70 years, or hospitalized patients or recent
use of antibiotics.
For these patients, an evaluation should be performed to distinguish between
inflammatory and noninflammatory causes of diarrhea. Routine evaluation includes:
• Testing for fecal leukocytes,
• Routine stool culture (performed for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter).
Additional testing might include:
• Examination of stool for ova and parasites, which may be considered in cases
of persistent diarrhea, especially if patient has exposure to infants in a day care
setting (Giardia, Cryptosporidium), or if there is a known community waterborne
outbreak of these infections.
• Nonroutine cultures, such as for E coli O157:H7, may be performed in cases of
acute bloody diarrhea, especially when there is a known local outbreak, or if the
patient develops hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
• Stool may also be tested for the C difficile toxin in patients with recent
antibiotic use.
If testing suggests a noninflammatory diarrhea, most cases are due to viral
infection (Norwalk, rotavirus), food poisoning (S aureus, B cereus, C perfringens)
or giardiasis. Viral infections and food poisoning are generally self-limited and are
treated with supportive care. Giardiasis is treated with metronidazole or tinidazole.

472

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

If testing suggests an inflammatory diarrhea, empiric therapy is usually instituted, often with quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin. An
exception to this strategy is in patients with suspected enterohemorrhagic E coli
(EHEC) infection. There is no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for EHEC
infections such as the O157:H7 strain, and there is concern about increased risk
of hemolytic uremic syndrome due to an increase in the production of Shiga toxin
when antibiotics are administered, so antibiotics are not recommended.

Chronic Diarrhea
Unlike acute diarrhea, most cases of chronic diarrhea are not infectious. In order to
evaluate and manage patients with chronic diarrhea, it is useful to classify them into
their pathophysiologic mechanism (see Table 55–1).

TABLE 55–1 • CAUSES OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

473

1. Secretory diarrhea is caused by a disruption of the water and electrolyte
transport across the intestinal epithelium. The diarrhea is typically described as
large volume, watery, without significant abdominal pain, and with no evidence
of stool fat or fecal leukocytes.
Hormone-producing tumors are uncommon but important causes of secretory
diarrhea. Carcinoid tumors typically arise in the small bowel, and may present with
diarrhea, episodic flushing, and wheezing. Diagnosis is established by demonstration of elevated serotonin levels, usually through finding high concentrations of
its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in a 24-hour urine collection. Gastrinomas are neuroendocrine tumors usually located in the pancreas that
secrete gastrin, causing high gastric acid levels and most often present with recurrent peptic ulcers, but also commonly causing diarrhea. The chronic diarrhea may
be the presenting feature in 10% of cases. Initial diagnostic testing includes finding
a markedly elevated fasting gastrin level. VIPomas are another pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as well as other
peptide hormones that causes profuse, sometimes massive, watery diarrhea with
profound dehydration and hypokalemia.
2. Osmotic diarrhea occurs with ingestion of large amounts of poorly absorbed,
osmotically active solute that draws water into the intestinal lumen. Common solutes include unabsorbed carbohydrates (sorbitol, lactulose, or lactose in
patients with patients with lactase deficiency) or divalent ions (magnesium or
sulfate, often used in laxatives). The fecal water output is proportional to the solute
load, so the diarrhea can be large or small volume. An important clinical clue
to distinguish between osmotic and secretory diarrhea is that secretory diarrhea
will persist during a 24 to 28-hour fast, whereas osmotic diarrhea should abate
with fasting, or when the patient stops ingesting the poorly absorbed solute.
By far, the most common cause of osmotic diarrhea is lactose intolerance,
which affects the large majority of the world’s nonwhite population, and
approximately 20% to 30% of the US population. Most people lose the brush
border lactase enzyme with age, and by adulthood, can no longer digest lactose.
Diagnosis is made clinically, by history, and with a trial of lactose avoidance.
Symptoms are managed by avoiding dairy products or supplementation with
oral lactase enzyme.
3. Inflammatory diarrhea is characterized by systemic symptoms such as fever, and
may have abdominal pain, with presence of blood in the stool. Stool studies will
typically show fecal leukocytes. The most common and important causes are the
inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn disease, which are
discussed more fully in Case 16.
4. Dysmotility is most often due to altered bowel motility due to a secondary cause
(hyperthyroidism, prokinetic medications), or due to visceral autonomic dysregulation, as in diabetic diarrhea. An extremely common but poorly understood
dysmotility disorder is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is characterized by
chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits without a clear organic cause.
Pain is typically relieved with defecation, and there is often mucus discharge

474

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

with stools and a sensation of incomplete voiding. Presence of any of the
following findings is not characteristic of IBS and should prompt investigation for
an organic cause of diarrhea: large-volume diarrhea, bloody stools, greasy stools,
significant weight loss, anemia, occult or overt gastrointestinal bleeding, or
nocturnal awakening with pain or diarrhea.
5. Malabsorption/steatorrhea. Malabsorption, or impaired absorption of nutrients,
can occur either because of intraluminal maldigestion, or due to mucosal
epithelial defects. In conditions causing malabsorption, steatorrhea is commonly
assessed as an indicator of global malabsorption primarily because the process of
fat absorption is complex and is sensitive to interference from absorptive disease
processes. Significant fat malabsorption produces greasy, foul-smelling diarrhea.
Hydroxylation by gut bacteria leads to increased concentration of intraluminal
fatty acids, causing an osmotic effect and increased stool output.
The most common cause of intraluminal maldigestion is pancreatic exocrine
insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis, most often due to alcohol abuse. Patients
present with chronic abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and pancreatic calcifications
on imaging, and may often have diabetes due to pancreatic endocrine dysfunction
and insulin deficiency. Treatment of malabsorption is with oral pancreatic enzyme
supplementation.
The most common and important cause of mucosal malabsorption is celiac disease. Originally described in pediatric patients with severe diarrhea and failure to
thrive, it is now understood that it is much more common than previously recognized, affecting approximately 1% of the population, with highest incidence in
white people of northern European ancestry. Patients with severe disease may present
with classic manifestations of malabsorption: greasy, voluminous, foul-smelling
stools, weight loss, severe anemia, neurologic disorders from deficiencies of B vitamins,
and osteopenia from deficiency of vitamin D and calcium. However, this spectrum
of findings is relatively uncommon, even in generalized mucosal disease. Adult
patients with undiagnosed celiac disease rarely present with profuse diarrhea and
severe metabolic disturbances. The majority of patients have relatively mild gastrointestinal symptoms, which often mimic more common disorders such as irritable
bowel syndrome, and may present solely with symptoms that are attributable to a
nutritional deficiency. For example, patients with unexplained iron deficiency anemia,
especially if it fails to correct adequately with iron supplementation, should be
suspected to have celiac disease.
The exact pathophysiology of celiac disease is uncertain, but current understanding is that genetically predisposed individuals develop an immune disorder that
is triggered by exposure to the gliadin component of gluten (a protein composite
found in foods processed from wheat and related grain species, including barley and
rye). Characteristic mucosal changes include villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia
in the proximal small bowel.
In patients for whom there is a high clinical suspicion of disease, one should
proceed to endoscopic evaluation with small bowel biopsy, and a serologic evaluation.
IgA anti-endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies
are highly specific and reasonably sensitive tests for celiac disease. For patients with

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

475

a low (<5%) clinical suspicion (no family history, no clinical or lab evidence of
malabsorption), one can screen with serologic evaluation only. Negative serology
adequately excludes the diagnosis in such patients. Note that all testing should be
done with patients on a gluten-rich diet for at least several weeks, as the mucosal
abnormalities may disappear and serologic titers fall after gluten withdrawal from
the diet.
The mainstay of treatment of celiac disease is adherence to a gluten-free diet.
Referral to a nutritionist may be appropriate, and there are a number of gluten-free
foods that are commercially available. In addition, nutritional deficiencies should be
repleted, and patients should be evaluated for bone loss using a DEXA scan. Patients
with celiac disease may also have a higher risk of malignancy (GI tract malignancies
and lymphoma), so one should maintain a higher index of suspicion.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
55.1 Which of the following features is not consistent with the diagnosis of irritable
bowel syndrome?
A. Abdominal pain relieved with defecation
B. Sensation of incomplete evacuation
C. Passage of mucus
D. Nocturnal awakening with pain or diarrhea
E. Normal bowel habits alternating with either diarrhea or constipation
55.2 Which of the following ﬁndings is more consistent with an osmotic, rather
than a secretory, diarrhea?
A. The diarrhea persists despite a 48-hour fast.
B. Stool osmolality = 290 mOsm, stool Na = 95 mOsm, stool K = 15 mOsm.
C. Diarrhea is large volume and watery, and is accompanied by paroxysms of
flushing and wheezing.
D. Profuse, painless “rice-water” stool in a patient in a cholera-endemic area.
55.3 Which of the following patients is not a good candidate for evaluation for
celiac disease, with either endoscopy or serologic testing?
A. A 26-year-old woman who experiences with intermittent abdominal
bloating but no diarrhea and is found to have osteopenia and vitamin D
deficiency.
B. A 19-year-old college freshman with bulky, foul-smelling, floating stools
and excessive flatulence, who has lost 20 lb unintentionally.
C. A thin, 39-year-old man with a family history of celiac disease, who has
been adhering to a gluten-free vegetarian diet for the last 3 years, and now
complains of gassiness and reflux.
D. A 42-year-old man who was found to have iron deficiency anemia, but has
no gastrointestinal symptoms, and recently had a negative colonoscopy.

476

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
55.1 D. Nocturnal diarrhea is not typically associated with IBS, and should prompt
further investigation, for example, with imaging or colonoscopy. The other
symptoms listed are included in commonly used diagnostic criteria for IBS. It
should be remembered that IBS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, and is
established when patients have typical symptoms, but other conditions with
similar clinical presentations have been excluded in a cost-effective manner.
55.2 B. Normal stool osmolality is equal to plasma, about 290 mOsm. In secretory
diarrhea, most of the osmotically active particles are electrolytes, and can be
calculated as 2 × [Na + K]. The size of osmotic gap (the difference between calculated and directly measured osmolality) is equivalent to the concentration
of the poorly absorbed unmeasured solute in the fecal water. This patient has a
stool osmotic gap of 70 (gap >50 is indicative of osmotic diarrhea). Answers C
and D are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome and cholera infection, respectively,
both causes of secretory diarrhea.
55.3 C. While GI symptoms in a patient with a family history of celiac disease are
reasonable to investigate, the fact that he has been on a gluten-free diet for
a prolonged period greatly diminishes the sensitivity of both endoscopic and
serologic testing. Unexplained osteopenia and vitamin D deﬁciency in a young
woman, unexplained iron deﬁciency anemia in any patient, and the classic
presentation with steatorrhea and weight loss should all be investigated.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Most cases of acute infectious diarrhea in the US cause mild to moderate
illness that is self-limited, and can be managed with oral rehydration
solution or with antimotility agents such as loperamide.



Empiric treatment with quinolone antibiotics is usually indicated for
acute inflammatory diarrhea. An exception is for enterohemorrhagic E coli
(EHEC) infection, where antibiotics may increase the risk of HUS.



Symptoms of malabsorption include greasy, voluminous stools, weight
loss, anemia, neurologic disorders from deficiencies of B vitamins, and
osteopenia from deficiency of vitamin D and calcium.



Adults with undiagnosed celiac disease often present with relatively
mild gastrointestinal symptoms, and may only present with unexplained
nutritional deficiency (eg, refractory iron deficiency anemia).



If there is a high clinical suspicion for celiac disease, patients should
undergo endoscopic evaluation with small bowel biopsy and serologies
for IgA anti-endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase
(TTG) antibodies.

CASE 56
A 56-year-old woman presents to her doctor’s office complaining of gradually
progressive, nonpainful enlargement of the terminal joint on her left hand over
a 9-month period. She has some stiffness with typing but not first thing in the
morning. She also reports pain in her right knee, which occasionally “locks up.”
The right knee also hurts after long walks. On examination, her blood pressure is
130/85 mm Hg, heart rate 80 bpm, and weight 285 lb. Examination reveals only a
nontender enlargement of her left distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and the right

ANSWERS TO CASE 56:
Osteoarthritis/Degenerative Joint Disease
Summary: The patient is a 56-year-old obese woman with complaints of activityrelated joint disease in the left DIP and right knee. There is no evidence of synovitis
on examination.
• Next step: Obtain erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plain x-rays of the
hand and knee.
• Most likely diagnosis: Osteoarthritis (OA).
• Best initial treatment: Acetaminophen up to 4 g qd.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the major clinical characteristics of OA.
2. Be familiar with management approaches to OA.
3. Understand the major classes of medications used for OA.
4. Know how to differentiate OA from inflammatory arthritis.

Considerations
This patient’s history and examination are characteristic of OA. Laboratory work,
typically negative for inflammatory arthritis, and x-rays will confirm the diagnosis. The
most important features are the gradual onset, the lack of active synovitis, and the fact
that her symptoms worsen with activity. If there were evidence of inflammation or joint
effusion, then the best next step would be to aspirate the fluid from the joint and send
it for various studies, including Gram stain and culture to assess for infection, crystal
analysis to assess for gout or pseudogout, and cell count to assess for inflammation.

APPROACH TO:
Osteoarthritis
DEFINITIONS
BOUCHARD NODES: Bony enlargement of proximal interphalangeal (PIP)
joints, often asymptomatic.
CREPITUS: A creaking or hook and loop (Velcro)-like sound made by a joint in
motion; typically not painful.
HEBERDEN NODES: Bony enlargement of DIP joints, often asymptomatic.
SYNOVITIS: Inflammation of the joint space characterized by redness, swelling,
and tenderness to touch.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

481

CLINICAL APPROACH
OA is the most common joint disease in adults. The disease affects women more
often than men. The incidence increases sharply in the fifth and sixth decades of
life. OA begins insidiously, progresses slowly, and eventually may lead to disability,
recurrent falls, inability to live independently, and significant morbidity.
Patients with OA often experience joint stiffness, which occurs with activity or
after inactivity (“gel phenomena”) and lasts for less than 15 to 30 minutes. This is
in contrast to the morning stiffness of patients with an inflammatory arthritis (eg,
rheumatoid arthritis [RA]), which often lasts for 1 to 2 hours and often requires warming, such as soaking in a hot tub, to improve. Early in the disease, there are no obvious findings. There may be some crepitus (creaking sound) in the joint, and, unlike
inflammatory arthritis, there is often no or minimal tissue swelling (except in the most
advanced disease). Bony prominences, especially in the DIP/PIP joints, can occur
later. Figure 22–1 shows a typical joint involvement in OA versus RA. Pain seen in
OA typically can be reproduced with passive motion of the joint. Table 56–1 lists the
patterns of typical joint involvement.
Laboratory examination typically is unremarkable; inflammatory markers such
as ESR, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and white blood cells (WBCs) all are
normal. Likewise, autoimmune studies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA),
rheumatoid factor, and complement levels also are normal. If the joint is aspirated, then examination of the synovial fluid also reflects a lack of inflammation: WBCs less than 2000/mm3, protein less than 45 mg/dL without crystals, and
glucose equal to serum. X-ray evaluation in OA may show osteophytes that are
the most specific finding in the disease but might not be found early. Other
characteristics seen on x-rays include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis,
and subchondral cysts.
It is critical to differentiate OA from other conditions that may present similarly.
Periarticular pain that is not reproduced with passive motion suggests bursitis or
tendonitis. Prolonged pain lasting for more than 1 hour points toward an inflammatory
arthritis. Intense inflammation suggests one of the microcrystalline diseases (gout/
pseudogout) or infectious arthritis. Systemic constitutional symptoms, such as weight
loss, fatigue, fever, anorexia, and malaise, indicate an underlying inflammatory
condition, such as polymyalgia rheumatic, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, or a malignancy, and generally demand aggressive evaluation.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Management
Education is critical. Encourage the patient to stay active, because not using the
joint can cause further immobility. Multiple short periods of rest throughout the day
are better than one large period. In patients with OA who are overweight, weight
loss of even modest degree may produce improvement in lower extremity joint pain
and function. Other methods of unloading an osteoarthritic joint include canes and
walkers, which can reduce joint forces at the hip by as much as 50%.
Equipment such as canes and/or walkers are helpful for patients with advanced
disease because these patients are less stable and, as a result, have frequent falls.
Physical therapy in the form of heat applied to the affected joints in early disease
often is helpful. Perhaps the most important intervention is having the patient
maintain full/near-full range of motion with regular exercise. Physical therapy and
exercise improve functional outcome and pain in OA by improving flexibility and
by strengthening muscles that support the affected joints. Moist superficial heat
can raise the threshold for pain, produce analgesia by acting on free nerve endings,
and decrease muscle spasm. Ultrasound therapy appears to have no proven benefit.
Superficial cooling decreases muscle spasm and increases the threshold of pain. Data
concerning the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in
patients with OA are conflicting.
Pharmacotherapy early in the course of the disease consists primarily of
acetaminophen, the mainstay of therapy. It is well tolerated and as effective as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; both nonprescription and prescription strength).
The use of glucosamine and chondroitin for OA has been controversial, and
results of randomized trials have varied. Most findings suggest that glucosamine and
chondroitin have little benefit in patients with osteoarthritis. There appear to be
few risks associated with their use, however, so patients who wish to try those
remedies can be advised that they appear to be relatively safe.
NSAIDs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) in the prostaglandin
catabolism pathway and work as either COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. For a long
time, COX-1 NSAIDs were the most commonly prescribed drug for OA. However,
COX-1 NSAIDs have well-documented side effects of gastrointestinal irritation and
bleeding and renal damage. NSAIDs are effective pain relievers in patients with
OA. The efficacy of acetaminophen has also been demonstrated to be superior to
placebo in relief of pain due to OA, but is less effective than NSAIDs.
The COX-2 inhibitor class has the same anti-inflammatory potential, with fewer
gastrointestinal side effects. Recent evidence about increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients using COX-2 inhibitors has led to the withdrawal of
rofecoxib and valdecoxib from the market; however, the remaining members of
the class should not be used in patients with known CV disease or multiple CV
risk factors. The selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib and etoricoxib) appear to
be as effective as the traditional nonspecific NSAIDs. Although they are associated
with less gastroduodenal toxicity, concerns about an increased risk of cardiovascular
adverse events has limited their use. Furthermore, the concomitant use of low-dose
aspirin for an antithrombotic effect may negate the gastroduodenal-sparing effects
of COX-2 inhibitors.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

Oral steroids are generally not used to treat OA. Intra-articular steroids may be
rarely useful for long-term treatment and can be helpful for the rare inflammation of
a loose cartilage fragment, which may cause the joint to “lock up.”
Surgery is reserved for only the most severe cases, which include patients who
have major instability, a loose body in the joint, intractable pain of advanced disease,
or severe functional limitation. Joint replacement is the typical procedure.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
56.1 A. Degenerative joint disease is a major cause of decreased functional status in
elderly patients and requires ongoing treatment and evaluation by the physician
to try to improve symptoms and to promote mobility. Oral steroids are not
helpful in this condition.
56.2 E. Rheumatoid arthritis gives the ulnar deviation of the ﬁngers.
56.3 B. Gouty arthritis often affects the ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal joint and can be
precipitated by various foods or alcohol.
56.4 A. Cervical discharge and inﬂammatory joint are consistent with gonococcal
arthritis, which can also present as a migratory arthritis.
56.5 D. The location and asymmetry of joint involvement, lack of inﬂammatory
signs, and worsening with exertion all are characteristic of OA.
56.6 E. Acetaminophen is the ﬁrst agent of choice in the treatment of early
osteoarthritis.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Osteoarthritis is the most common articular disease of adults, most often
affecting the distal interphalangeal joints > proximal interphalangeal
joints > knees > hip joints.



Pain in osteoarthritis is worsened with activity and is not associated with
morning stiffness.



No pharmacologic agents that modify or stop disease progression are
available. Treatment is aimed at symptom relief.



Initial pharmacologic therapy should be acetaminophen. Joint replacement for severe osteoarthritis is reserved for patients with intractable pain
despite medical therapy and for those with severe functional limitations.

CASE 57
A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of
abdominal discomfort and passage of several large, black, tarry stools. He became
diaphoretic and began to experience chest pain, similar to that of his recent
myocardial infarction. Three weeks ago, he suffered an uncomplicated non–
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Coronary angiography performed
prior to discharge revealed no significant coronary artery stenosis. He was discharged
home with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and metoprolol. On examination, his
heart rate is 104 bpm. His blood pressure is 124/92 mm Hg while lying down
but drops to 95/70 mm Hg upon standing. He appears pale and uncomfortable,
and he is covered with a fine layer of sweat. His neck veins are flat, his chest is
clear to auscultation, and his heart rhythm is tachycardic but regular, with a soft
systolic murmur at the right sternal border and an S4 gallop. His apical impulse is
focal and nondisplaced. His abdomen is soft with active bowel sounds and mild
epigastric tenderness, but no guarding or rebound tenderness, and no masses or
organomegaly are appreciated. Rectal examination shows black, sticky stool, which
is strongly positive for occult blood. His hemoglobin level is 5.9 g/dL, prothrombin
time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) both are normal, and he has
normal renal function and liver function tests. Electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals
sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment changes, but T-wave inversion in the anterior
precordial leads and no ventricular ectopy. Creatine kinase (CK) is 127 U/L (units/liter)
with a normal CK-MB (myocardial) fraction, and troponin I levels are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 57:
Transfusion Medicine
Summary: A man with a recent myocardial infarction but no critical coronary artery
stenosis on a coronary angiogram is admitted with angina pectoris at rest and ECG
changes consistent with recurrent cardiac ischemia. In addition, he has melena and
epigastric tenderness, indicating an upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, likely
caused by his use of antiplatelet agents. He is tachycardic and has orthostatic hypotension, likely indicating significant hypovolemia as a result of blood loss.
• Most likely diagnosis: Unstable angina, which has been precipitated by anemia
because of acute GI blood loss.
• Next step: Transfusion with packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the indications for transfusion of red blood cells.
2. Know the complications of transfusions.
3. Be aware of alternatives to transfusion.
4. Know the indications for transfusion of platelets and of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP).

Considerations
This patient has two urgent problems. He has suffered an upper GI hemorrhage,
with enough blood loss to cause hemodynamic compromise. In addition, he has
unstable angina, given his severe prolonged chest pain at rest but lack of definitive
ECG or cardiac biomarker evidence of myocardial infarction. Rather than being
a primary problem with his coronary arteries, such as thrombosis or vasospasm,
the cardiac ischemia is likely secondary to his acute blood loss and consequent
tachycardia and loss of hemoglobin and its oxygen-carrying capacity. He should be
treated with urgent replacement of blood volume.

APPROACH TO:
Symptomatic Anemia
DEFINITIONS
UNSTABLE ANGINA: Angina pectoris or equivalent ischemic discomfort
occurring at rest, or severe and new onset, or in a crescendo pattern.
NON–ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (NSTEMI): Clinical
features of unstable angina, but with evidence of myocardial necrosis, seen in elevated
cardiac biomarkers.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

487

TRALI: Transfusion-related acute lung injury, due to an immune-mediated lung
injury.
ACUTE HEMOLYTIC REACTION: Transfusion reaction due to antibody lysis
of transfused red blood cells.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Symptoms attributable to anemia are manifold and depend primarily on the patient’s
underlying cardiopulmonary status and the chronicity with which the anemia developed.
For a slowly developing, chronic anemia in patients with good cardiopulmonary reserve,
symptoms may not be noted until the hemoglobin level falls very low, for example, to
3 or 4 g/dL. For patients with serious underlying cardiopulmonary disease who
depend on adequate oxygen-carrying capacity, smaller declines in hemoglobin level
can be devastating. Such is the case with the man in this clinical scenario, who
is suffering a cardiac complication as a consequence of his anemia, in this case,
unstable angina.
Unstable angina (UA) is characterized by ischemic chest pain at rest, of new
onset, or occurring at a lower level of activity. Unstable angina is distinguished
from NSTEMI or STEMI in that UA does not cause elevated levels of cardiac
biomarkers or ST-segment elevation on ECG. Patients who present with UA or
NSTEMI vary widely in their risk of death or recurrent infarction at 30 days, so
they benefit from a risk-stratification assessment to guide their initial treatment and
evaluation. Data from the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials provided a simple and useful clinical risk scoring system. Seven independent risk factors are assessed: age >65 years, three or more risk factors for coronary artery disease
(CAD), >50% coronary stenosis on angiography, ST deviation, two or more anginal
episodes in 24 hours, symptoms despite the use of aspirin, or elevated cardiac
biomarkers. Patients with higher TIMI risk scores are often treated with more aggressive antithrombotic therapy, or with early coronary angiography within 48 hours of
admission, and possible revascularization, if the coronary anatomy is suitable.
For this patient who had suffered a recent NSTEMI, he had been found on angiography to have no apparent critical coronary artery stenosis, which is the case in
10% of patients with UA or NSTEMI. He has been treated with medical management, including dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. In this case,
it is more likely that his angina is secondary to the acute drop in hemoglobin rather
than new cardiac disease.
In this case of secondary angina, the anemia must be corrected, which requires
an understanding of transfusion medicine. Anemia is generally considered to be a
hemoglobin level less than 12 g/dL in women or less than 13 g/dL in men. Although
lower values often can be tolerated or underlying etiologies treated, blood transfusions have been both necessary and lifesaving at times. In addition to PRBCs, there
are other components of whole blood, including platelets, FFP, cryoprecipitate, and
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Indications for use of each of these blood components is described below.
Indications for transfusion of PRBCs are acute surgical or nonsurgical blood
loss, anemia with end-organ effects (eg, syncope, angina pectoris) or hemodynamic

488

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

compromise, and in critical illness to improve oxygen-carrying capacity or delivery
to tissues. However, there are no absolute guidelines or thresholds for transfusion.
Many believe that a hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL is adequate in the absence of a
clearly defined increased need, such as cardiac ischemia, for which a hematocrit
level of at least 30% may be desired. In the absence of ongoing bleeding or destruction of red cells, we typically expect that each unit of PRBC will result in an
increase of 1 g/dL in the hemoglobin level or 3% in the hematocrit level.
Transfusion carries a small but definite risk, including transmission of infection,
reactions, and consequences. Viruses that are screened for but that can be passed
include hepatitis C virus (1 in 103 000 units), human T-cell lymphocyte virus types I
and II, human immunodeficiency virus (1 in 700 000), hepatitis B virus (1 in 66 000),
and parvovirus B19. Rarely, bacterial contamination (eg, Yersinia enterocolitica) causes
fevers, sepsis, and even death during or soon after transfusion. Parasites (eg, malaria)
are screened for by questioning a donor’s medical and travel history.
There are also noninfectious concerns, both immune and nonimmune mediated.
With respect to immune mechanisms, it is possible that a recipient has preformed
natural antibodies that lyse foreign donor erythrocytes, which can be associated
with the major A and/or B or O blood types or with other antigens (eg, D, Duffy,
Kidd). Because hemolysis can ensue, a “type and cross” is first performed, in which
blood samples are tested for compatibility prior to transfusion. The most common
cause of this reaction actually is clerical (ie, mislabeling). Acute hemolytic
reactions may present with hypotension, fever, chills, hemoglobinuria, and flank
pain. The transfusion must be halted immediately, and fluid and diuretics (or even
dialysis) should be given to protect the kidney from failure via immune-complex
deposits. Laboratory work for intravascular hemolysis should be checked (lactate
dehydrogenase [LDH], indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin), as well as coagulation tests
for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Less predictably, milder, delayed
hemolytic reactions involving amnestic responses from the recipient can occur.
Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions can occur and may be helped by antipyretics. Reactions range from urticaria treated with diphenhydramine and transfusion interruption to anaphylaxis, in which case the transfusion must be stopped, and
epinephrine and steroids are needed. Sometimes seen is transfusion-related acute
lung injury (TRALI), in which the appearance of bilateral interstitial infiltrates in
the lung represents noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Considering nonimmune consequences, the transfusion itself supplies 300 mL
per unit of PRBC intravascularly, so patients can easily become volume overloaded.
Adjusting the volume and rate and using diuretics will prevent this complication.
Each unit of blood also provides 250 mg of iron. Multiple and frequent transfusions
can cause iron overload and deposition (hemosiderosis), leading to cirrhosis, cardiac
problems (eg, arrhythmia, heart failure), or diabetes.
Alternatives to transfusion have shown a role for erythropoietin, a hormone that
promotes red cell production. It is often used in the treatment of patients with renal
failure–related anemia. It also can be used in patients who are banking a presurgical
autologous transfusion to encourage quicker recovery of their hemoglobin levels prior
to surgery. Cell savers salvage some intraoperative blood losses, which are then
transfused back into the patient. Some patients may not wish to have foreign blood

products transfused based on religious convictions. In these cases, we can increase
the baseline hemoglobin level by using erythropoietin and iron before planned
surgery, minimize phlebotomy for laboratory testing, and use cell savers during
surgery. Ultimately, however, a competent patient’s wishes are to be respected.
Thrombocytopenia can frequently be treated with platelet transfusion. When a
patient has a platelet count of less than 50,000/mm3 and has significant bleeding, or
when a patient is at risk for spontaneous bleeding with a level of less than 10 000/mm3,
platelets can be transfused. Each unit increases the platelet count from 5000 to
10 000/mm3. In cases such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), in which
platelets are being destroyed, however, transfusion is generally not helpful unless
active bleeding is occurring. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated in patients with
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), as it may worsen microvascular
thrombosis and cause worsening neurologic symptoms or renal failure.
FFP replaces clotting factors and is often given to reverse warfarin (Coumadin) anticoagulation. Cryoprecipitate from FFP replaces fibrinogen and some clotting factors,
making it useful in patients with hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease (vWD).
IVIg (pooled polyvalent IgG) is administered to patients with immune deficiencies with low antibody levels, as well as to patients with antibody-mediated
autoimmunity, such as immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura, or as an
immunomodulatory agent in Kawasaki disease. One caution is that in patients with
IgA deficiency (1 in 600 individuals of European origin), transfusion with IVIg or
FFP can cause anaphylaxis because of the presence of anti-IgA antibodies.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
57.1 A 32-year-old man is brought into the emergency room after a motor vehicle
accident. He is noted to be in hypovolemic shock with a blood pressure of
60/40 mm Hg. He is actively bleeding from a femur fracture. The patient’s
hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL. His wife is positive that the patient’s blood type is
A positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate type of blood to be
transfused?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Give AB-positive blood, uncross-matched.
Await cross-matched A-positive blood.
Give type-specific A-positive blood, uncross-matched.
Give O-negative blood, uncross-matched.

57.2 A 45-year-old woman is noted to have severe menorrhagia over 6 months and
a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL. She feels dizzy, weak, and fatigued. She receives
3 units of packed erythrocytes intravenously. Two hours into the transfusion, she
develops fever to 103°F and shaking chills. Which of the following laboratory
tests would most likely conﬁrm an acute transfusion reaction?
A. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level
B. Leukocyte count
C. Direct bilirubin level
D. Glucose level

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

57.3 A 57-year-old man has a prosthetic aortic valve for which he takes warfarin
(Coumadin) 10 mg/d. He is noted to have an international normalized ratio
(INR) of 7.0 and is actively bleeding large clots from his gums, rectum, and
when urinating. Which of the following is the best management for this
patient?
A. Administer vitamin D.
B. Transfuse with fresh-frozen plasma.
C. Administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).
D. Discontinue the warfarin (Coumadin) and observe.

ANSWERS
57.1 D. This patient needs a blood transfusion immediately, as evidenced by his
dangerously low blood pressure. He does not have the 45 minutes required for
cross-matching his blood. Even though the patient’s wife is “absolutely sure”
about the blood type, history is not completely reliable, and in an emergent
situation such that uncross-matched blood must be given, O-negative blood
(universal donor) usually is administered.
57.2 A. Elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin levels or decreased haptoglobin levels
would be consistent with hemolysis.
57.3 B. When life-threatening acute bleeding occurs in the face of coagulopathy
due to warfarin (Coumadin) use, the treatment is fresh-frozen plasma. The
INR is extremely high, consistent with a severe coagulopathy. Sometimes
vitamin K administration can be helpful if the bleeding is not severe.

CLINICAL PEARLS


The symptoms of anemia are related to the rapidity or chronicity with which
the anemia developed as well as the patients’ underlying cardiopulmonary
status.



Myocardial ischemia or infarction may be precipitated by factors not
related to the coronary arteries, such as tachycardia or severe anemia,
with loss of oxygen-carrying capacity.



Transfusion of blood carries certain risks, such as hemolytic reaction,
infection (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or hepatitis C), and
transfusion-related lung injury.



Platelet transfusions are indicated for severe thrombocytopenia with
bleeding symptoms, but they may have limited benefit in ITP, and are
definitely contraindicated in TTP.



Fresh-frozen plasma is used to correct coagulopathy by providing clotting
factors.

CASE 58
A 26-year-old woman presents to the emergency room on a Saturday afternoon
with complaints of bleeding from her nose and mouth since the previous night.
She also noticed small, reddish spots on her lower extremities when she got out
of the bed in the morning. She denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, or joint pain. The patient reports she had developed an upper respiratory
infection 2 weeks prior to the emergency room visit, but the infection has now
resolved. She denies significant medical problems. Her menses have been normal,
and her last menstrual period was approximately 2 weeks ago. She denies
excessive bleeding in the past, even after delivering her baby. Prior to this episode,
she never had epistaxis, easy bruisability, or bleeding into her joints. There is no
family history of abnormal bleeding. The patient does not take any medications.
On examination she is alert, oriented, and somewhat anxious. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, her heart rate is 90 bpm, and she is afebrile. No pallor or
jaundice is noted. There is bright red oozing from the nose and the gingiva. Skin
examination reveals multiple 1-mm flat reddish spots on her lower extremities.
The rest of the examination is normal. There is no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Her complete blood cell count (CBC) is normal except for a platelet
count of 18,000/mm3. Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time
(PTT) are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 58:
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura
Summary: A 26-year-old woman is seen in the emergency room because of persistent
epistaxis. She denies excessive bleeding with menses or childbirth, easy bruisability, or
bleeding into her joints. There is no family history of abnormal bleeding. The patient
does not take any medications. Physical examination is significant only for the blood
oozing from her nose and for the petechiae on her legs. There is no lymphadenopathy
or hepatosplenomegaly. Her CBC shows thrombocytopenia, but the other cell lines
are normal.
• Most likely diagnosis: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
• Best initial treatment: Oral corticosteroids

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the clinical approach to bleeding disorders, specifically platelets disorders
versus coagulation disorders.
2. Learn about the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia, specifically thrombocytopenic purpura versus other platelet disorders, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
3. Learn about the treatment of ITP.

Considerations
This patient presents with mucosal bleeding, petechiae, and thrombocytopenia. She
has no other history, symptoms, or physical examination findings of any systemic
disease, so her problem appears to an isolated hematologic problem. Review of her
CBC is important to ensure that other cell lines (white blood cell count [WBC]
and red blood cell count [RBC]) are normal; if they are abnormal, conditions such
as acute leukemia or a bone marrow infiltrative process must be considered. Her
coagulation studies (PT and PTT) are also normal; if they were deranged, we would
suspect a consumptive coagulopathy causing the thrombocytopenia and a serious
underlying disorder. Her current level of thrombocytopenia does not pose a risk for
spontaneous hemorrhage, but platelet counts less than between 5000 and 10 000/mm3
would place her at risk for life-threatening bleeding.

THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA (TTP): A lifethreatening syndrome of uncertain etiology characterized by a pentad of
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic abnormalities,
fever, and renal dysfunction.
HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME (HUS): A clinical complex consisting of
progressive renal failure that is associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
and thrombocytopenia.

CLINICAL APPROACH
A careful history is the most effective way to determine the presence and significance
of a bleeding disorder. For a patient with abnormal bleeding, the most important
history relates to any prior history of bleeding. One should inquire about history
of abnormal bleeding, epistaxis, menorrhagia, excessive prolonged bleeding from
minor cuts, bruising, prolonged or profuse bleeding after dental extraction, excessive
bleeding after major surgery or obstetric delivery, or trauma. Excessive mucosal bleeding (eg, gum and nose bleedings) and petechiae are suggestive of thrombocytopenia,
or abnormal platelet function such as von Willebrand disease (vWD). On the
other hand, hemarthrosis, deep hematomas, and retroperitoneal bleeding more
likely reflect a severe coagulation abnormality, such as hemophilia or deficiencies
of factors VIII or IX.
Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 000/mm3,
although spontaneous bleeding usually occurs at much lower platelet counts. The
causes of thrombocytopenia can be divided into (1) decreased platelet production,
(2) decreased platelet survival, (3) sequestration (hypersplenism), and (4) dilutional.
Impaired platelet production is caused by a bone marrow abnormality, such as
infiltration caused by malignancy or myelofibrosis, marrow suppression as a result of
chemicals, drugs, or radiation, and viruses. In these cases, thrombocytopenia is rarely
seen without abnormalities in the other cell lines. Therefore, when impaired platelet production is the result of a bone marrow abnormality, we also expect abnormalities in the number of leukocytes and red cells. Decreased platelet survival is another
cause of thrombocytopenia. Mild thrombocytopenia may be seen in pregnancy,
and much more significant thrombocytopenia is seen with HELLP (hemolysis,
elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome. Decreased platelet survival can
be a result of immune-mediated platelet destruction triggered by medications or
various infections, in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

496

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

or for uncertain causes as in immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
Decreased platelet survival can also be due to splenic sequestration in patients with
splenomegaly for various reasons (eg, portal hypertension, myelofibrosis).
ITP: Acute ITP is most common in early childhood, often following an antecedent upper respiratory infection, and usually is self-limiting. In children, ITP usually
resolves spontaneously within 3 to 6 months. ITP in adults is more likely to have
an insidious or subacute presentation, is most likely to occur in women ages 20 to
40 years old, and is more likely to persist for months to years, with uncommon
spontaneous remission. The patient will present with the clinical manifestations
of thrombocytopenia, such as petechiae and mucosal bleeding, but with no systemic
toxicity, no lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, normal white and red blood cell
counts, and normal peripheral blood smear except for thrombocytopenia. Laboratory testing is usually focused on a search for secondary causes of thrombocytopenia
such as HIV, hepatitis C, ANA (for SLE), and a direct Coombs test to evaluate for
autoimmune hemolytic anemia with ITP (Evans syndrome). Bone marrow examination
is generally performed in patients older than 60 years of age to exclude myelodysplasia,
and often reveals increased megakaryocytes but otherwise normal findings.
In 80% of children affected with ITP, spontaneous remission occurs within
6 weeks, but spontaneous recovery in adults is less common. Many physicians elect
to treat affected patients, especially adults, with oral steroids, such as prednisone
1 mg/kg of body weight. Platelet transfusions usually are unnecessary and should be
reserved for rare life-threatening situations because survival of transfused platelets in
ITP may be as short as a few minutes. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is often
used when platelet counts are less than 10 000/mm3 and is used concurrently with
steroids. Because the spleen removes the antibody-bound platelets, patients who do
not respond to steroids may be candidates for splenectomy. Patients being considered for splenectomy should receive immunizations for encapsulated organisms such
as Pneumococcus prior to surgery.
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia: When a patient presents with thrombocytopenia,
any drug that the patient is using should be considered a possible cause. Common drugs
known to cause thrombocytopenia include H2 blockers, quinine, and sulfonamides.
In general, the diagnosis is made by clinical observation of the response to drug
withdrawal. Discontinuation of the offending medication should lead to improvement
in the platelet count within a time frame consistent with the drug’s metabolism, almost
always within 7 to 10 days.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): HIT is an immune-mediated disorder caused by the formation of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor
4 complex, with the fall in platelet count usually occurring 5 to 10 days after
heparin is begun, and sooner if the patient had been sensitized by prior heparin
use. HIT can cause serious consequences. HIT differs from other drug-induced
causes of thrombocytopenia in that it is not associated with bleeding, but rather
with increased risk of thrombosis. The 4 T’s are a useful mnemonic of the diagnostic
criteria for HIT:
• Thrombocytopenia (nadir rarely <20 000/μL).
• Timing of platelet count drop (usually 5-10 days).

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

497

• Thrombosis.
• OTher causes of thrombocytopenia are not likely.
Diagnosis depends on clinical suspicion, and utilization of an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the HIT antibodies. Treatment includes discontinuation of the heparin (one cannot switch from unfractionated heparin to
low-molecular-weight heparin because HIT antibodies will cross-react), and instead
use a direct thrombin inhibitor such as argatroban or lepirudin to treat thrombosis.
Thrombocytopenia may also be caused by consumptive coagulopathy, the most
common of which is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC usually is
triggered by serious underlying conditions such as bacterial sepsis, malignancy such
as acute promyelotic leukemia, or obstetric catastrophes such as abruptio placentae.
Any of these disease processes can produce blood exposure to pathologic levels of
tissue factor, triggering uncontrolled thrombin generation with systemic fibrin deposition in the microcirculation. This uncontrolled activation of coagulation results
in consumption of platelets and clotting factors, leading secondarily to bleeding.
Laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia and elevated PT and PTT (reflecting
the consumptive coagulopathy), and decreased fibrinogen and elevated fibrin-split
products and D-dimer (reflecting uncontrolled fibrin deposition). Usually, the cause
of DIC is obvious, and treatment should be directed toward correcting the underlying cause, as well as replacement of platelets and coagulation factors if there is clinically significant bleeding.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): A less common disease process that
may be confused with DIC is TTP. TTP may be triggered by infection such as HIV or
medications such as clopidogrel, or it may be idiopathic. As originally described, TTP
has a pentad of findings: (1) thrombocytopenia; (2) microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and schistocytosis in the
peripheral blood smear; (3) fever; (4) fluctuating central nervous system (CNS)
deficits with altered mental status; and (5) renal failure. Patients may be acutely
ill, and differentiation from DIC may be challenging, except that the PT and PTT
are typically normal in TTP, but elevated in DIC. Plasma exchange is the standard
treatment and has reduced the mortality of this condition greatly. Table 58–1 compares
DIC, TTP, and ITP.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS): HUS presents very similarly to TTP, with
acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
Clinically, it may appear to be “TTP limited to the kidney,” but the pathogenetic
mechanisms and treatment differ from TTP. HUS occurs most often in children
after a diarrheal illness, often with the hemorrhagic strain of E coli O157:H7.
Treatment is supportive, and plasma exchange for HUS has not shown to be useful.
von Willebrand disease (vWD): vWD patients present clinically with impaired primary hemostasis (ie, petechiae, easy bruising, mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia) with
normal platelet counts, but impaired platelet function. vWD is the most common
inherited bleeding disorder. It may occur as often as 1 in 1000 individuals. It is an
autosomal dominant disorder but often is not recognized because of relatively mild
bleeding symptoms or because of excessive bleeding attributed to other causes, for
example, menorrhagia attributed to uterine fibroids. von Willebrand factor (vWF) is

a large complex multimeric protein that has two major functions: it allows for

protein for coagulation factor VIII, which stabilizes the molecule. vWD is a
heterogenous group of disorders, but a common feature is deficiency in the amount
or function of vWF. Clinical features are those of primary hemostatic defects as
discussed. Typical laboratory features are reduced levels of vWF, reduced vWF
activity as measured by ristocetin cofactor assay, and reduced factor VIII activity.
The platelet count is usually normal, bleeding time is increased, and pTT may or
may not be prolonged. Treatment is desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), which causes
release of vWF from endothelial stores, or use of factor VIII concentrate, which
contains a large amount of vWF.

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

ANSWERS
58.1 D. The thrombocytopenia is seen with other hematologic abnormalities, the
most abnormal of which is a markedly elevated WBC count, suggesting acute
leukemia.
58.2 B. This patient with rheumatoid arthritis likely has splenomegaly, also known
as Felty syndrome. Splenomegaly from any etiology may cause sequestration of
platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia.
58.3 C. Patients who undergo splenectomy are at risk for infections of encapsulated
organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and thus should receive the pneumococcal vaccine. It usually is given 2 weeks prior to splenectomy so that the
spleen can help in forming a better immune response.
58.4 D. The patient likely has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which may be
conﬁrmed by assay for HIT antibodies. Treatment consists of stopping the
heparin.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Disorders of primary hemostasis (thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand
disease) are characterized by mucosal bleeding and the appearance of
petechiae or superficial ecchymoses.



Disorders of secondary hemostasis (coagulation factor deficiencies such
as hemophilia) usually are characterized by the development of superficial ecchymoses as well as deep hematomas and hemarthroses.



Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients
have isolated thrombocytopenia (ie, no red or white blood cell abnormalities); no apparent secondary causes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or medication-induced
thrombocytopenia; and normal to increased numbers of megakaryocytes
in the bone marrow.



Spontaneous hemorrhage may occur with platelet counts of less than
10 000/mm3.



Platelet transfusion in immune thrombocytopenic purpura is often ineffective and is used only when there is severe life-threatening bleeding.



Corticosteroids are the initial treatment of immune thrombocytopenic
purpura. Patients with more severe disease can be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin; chronic refractory cases are treated with
splenectomy.

CASE 59
A 65-year-old man with benign prostatic hypertrophy had been experiencing difficulty
with urination, and so he saw his urologist to be evaluated for a transurethral resection of the prostate. As part of the routine preoperative evaluation, he had a complete
blood count, but that was found to be abnormal. The procedure was cancelled and he
is now referred to the internal medicine clinic for additional evaluation.
Aside from his prostate symptoms, the patient is asymptomatic. He has not
experienced any recent fevers, chills, night sweats, arthralgias, or myalgias. His
appetite is good and his weight has been stable. He is moderately physically
active, plays golf regularly, and has not noted any fatigue or exertional dyspnea.
On examination, he is afebrile and normotensive. His conjunctivae are anicteric,
and his skin and oral mucosa show no pallor. His chest is clear to auscultation,
and his heart is regular without any murmurs. On abdominal examination, his liver
span seems normal, and there is no palpable spleen. He does not have any palpable cervical, axillary, or inguinal adenopathy.
Labs show the following results: White blood cell count is 56 000 with
90% mature lymphocytes and 10% neutrophils, hemoglobin is 14.8 g/dL, hematocrit
45%, and platelet count 189 000. Other labs including electrolytes, creatinine, and
transaminases are all within normal limits.

ANSWERS TO CASE 59:
Lymphocytosis/CLL
Summary: A 65-year-old man has been in generally good health, and is incidentally
noted to have a marked lymphocytosis (50 000/μL) on a routine lab test. He has
had no recent fevers or other symptoms of infection. He is asymptomatic, and his
physical examination is normal, without any pallor, petechiae, peripheral adenopathy,
or splenomegaly. He has an elevated lymphocyte count on his CBC, but the other cell
lines are normal.
• Most likely diagnosis: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
• Most appropriate next step: Flow cytometry of peripheral blood to demonstrate
a monoclonal B-cell population, and confirm the diagnosis

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to evaluate a patient with leukocytosis to distinguish between acute and
chronic leukemias, and nonmalignant causes of leukocytosis.
2. Know the diagnostic criteria and staging system for CLL.
3. Be familiar with the complications of CLL.

Considerations
In a patient presenting with marked leukocytosis, the first consideration is to try to
distinguish between malignant and nonmalignant (usually infectious) causes of the
elevated white blood cell count. This man is afebrile without any symptoms of infection, so infectious causes are unlikely. Since he is essentially asymptomatic and does
not have anemia or thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia is also unlikely. The next
steps would be to confirm the diagnosis of CLL with peripheral blood flow cytometry
to demonstrate that the lymphocytosis is due to monoclonal proliferation, and then
to stage the disease, so he can be advised regarding treatment decisions.

APPROACH TO:
Lymphocytosis
DEFINITIONS
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL): Increased number of circulating mature lymphocytes (usually >10 000/μL) that are monoclonal B cells expressing
the CD5 antigen.
SMALL LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA (SLL): Malignancy of mature
B-lymphocytes that are monoclonal in origin. Synonymous with CLL, considered

the same disease at different stages. If the clinical presentation is lymphadenopathy
without peripheral lymphocytosis (<5000/μL), it is termed SLL.
LEUKEMOID REACTION: Leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and WBC count
>30 000-50 000/μL, with immature neutrophils (myelocytes, metamyelocytes,
promyelocytes) that are not monoclonal.

CLINICAL APPROACH
In patients who are found to have a significantly elevated WBC count, a common
clinical problem is to differentiate a hematologic malignancy from a reactive
leukocytosis as a response to infection or inflammation.
If the elevated WBCs are predominantly myeloid cells, the differential diagnosis is
usually between a leukemoid reaction and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
In patients with a leukemoid reaction, the peripheral smear may show myelocytes,
metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and sometimes myeloblasts. Leukocyte alkaline
phosphatase (LAP) is elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is low in CML cells.
Leukemoid reactions are not dangerous in and of themselves, but they typically
represent a response to a significant underlying disease state.
Patients with CML typically present with elevated WBC count, with increased
mature and immature granulocytes, basophilia, and may also have a mild normocytic anemia and elevated platelet count. Patients with significant anemia or
thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for an alternative diagnosis. At diagnosis, many
patients with CML are asymptomatic, or may have mild nonspecific symptoms
such as fatigue, or might report some abdominal discomfort or early satiety due to
splenomegaly. If CML is suspected, the diagnostic test of choice is an assay for the
presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22), using either cytogenetics or
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. This
dysregulation of tyrosine kinase activity is part of the pathogenesis of CML. Initial
treatment of patients in the chronic stable phase is usually with the targeted agent
imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that blocks BCR-ABL–mediated signal
transduction, and induces apoptosis in cells expressing BCR-ABL.
In contrast to the asymptomatic or subacute presentation of patients with CML,
patients with acute leukemia present with marked leukocytosis but with anemia
and thrombocytopenia, or with pancytopenia. Symptoms may include weakness,
easy fatigability and dyspnea due to anemia, infections of due to neutropenia, or
bleeding symptoms such as gingival bleeding, epistaxis, or menorrhagia. Occasionally, patients present with an extramedullary tumor mass due to accumulation of blast
cells. Patients with hyperleukocytosis (WBC >50 000-100 000/μL) may develop
leukostasis, which is the symptomatic state caused by microvascular ischemia due to
white cell plugs, typically produces respiratory or neurologic distress, and is a medical emergency. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid
leukemia (ALL) is established by bone marrow biopsy using morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis. Initial management is stabilization and supportive
care for acutely ill patients, and treatment with induction chemotherapy to try to
achieve complete remission (CR).

506

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

Lymphocytosis
The most common clinical scenario involving elevated WBC count is a patient
presenting with lymphocytosis. To determine if a lymphocytosis is present, one
must calculate the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), which is equal to the product
of the total white blood cell count (WBC) and the fraction of lymphocytes on
the WBC differential: ALC = Total WBC (cells/μL) × % lymphocytes ÷ 100.
Lymphocytosis is present if the ALC >4000/μL.
Causes of lymphocytosis are listed in Table 59–1.
Lymphocytosis is most frequently found in viral infections and only rarely in
bacterial infection except pertussis. Pertussis (whooping cough) is often associated
with ALC of 20 000-30 000/μL. The lymphocytes are small and mature appearing
on peripheral smear. Other infections that can cause lymphocytosis are toxoplasmosis,
brucellosis, and sometimes syphilis. The most common viral infection associated
with lymphocytosis is Epstein-Barr virus. The clinical syndrome of infectious
mononucleosis caused by EBV or other viral infections that are listed is characterized
by fever and lymphadenopathy, and may produce larger, reactive lymphocytes
(atypical lymphocytosis).

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
CLL/SLL is an indolent disorder characterized by the monoclonal proliferation of
mature B-lymphocytes that express the CD5 antigen. It may present as either a
leukemia or a lymphoma, depending on whether lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy is
the predominant finding. Patients with CLL or SLL are often asymptomatic, and
present with incidental discovery of lymphocytosis or painless adenopathy, respectively. On the peripheral blood smear of patients with CLL, there is an increased
number of small, well-differentiated lymphocytes, which are fragile and are often
seen as broken or “smudge” cells. Diagnosis of CLL is confirmed by peripheral blood
flow cytometry demonstrating a monoclonal B-cell population that shows aberrant
expression of a T-cell antigen (CD5).

CLL is a generally indolent disease but prognosis is extremely variable, with
survival times from initial diagnosis that range from 2 to 12 years. The prognosis
depends on the stage of disease, and a commonly used staging system is the Rai
system based upon the concept that there is a gradual and progressive increase in
the body burden of leukemic lymphocytes, starting in the blood and bone marrow
(lymphocytosis), progressively involving lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), spleen
and liver (organomegaly), with eventual compromise of bone marrow function
(anemia and thrombocytopenia). Median survival time ranges from 12 years at
stage 0, 6 to 8 years at stage I/II, and 2 years at stage III/IV (Table 59–2).
Patients with CLL have an imbalance of lymphocyte subsets and may develop
altered immune responses including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and
autoimmune thrombocytopenia, as well as recurrent viral and bacterial infections.
In a small percentage of cases, CLL may transform into an aggressive large cell lymphoma (Richter syndrome) characterized by constitutional symptoms (fever, night
sweats), progressive lymphadenopathy, and often extranodal (eg, liver) involvement.
CLL is considered an incurable disease, and many patients do not require treatment
initially. Treatment is usually indicated if the patient develops any of the following
symptoms: pancytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia,
symptomatic bulky adenopathy or splenomegaly, or Richter syndrome.

59.2 Which of the following statements regarding CML is true?
A. Peripheral smear shows elevated WBC count with mature and immature
granulocytes, toxic granulation, and high LAP score.
B. Usually presents initially with splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
C. Chromosomal translocations, most often t(9;22), are found in 90%-95%
of patients.
D. Is an indolent disease, and should be monitored without treatment until
patients enter accelerated or blast phase.
59.3 A 75-year-old woman, diagnosed with stage 0 CLL 1 year ago and being
monitored without treatment, now complains of fatigue and dyspnea. She
has no palpable adenopathy or splenomegaly, no rashes or arthritis, and her
CBC shows ALC 11 000/μL, with hemoglobin 6.8 mg/dL, and platelet count
127 000/μL. What is the most appropriate diagnostic test?
A. Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test
B. Antinuclear antibody
C. Bone marrow biopsy
D. Test for Lewis alloantibody

ANSWERS
59.1 D. The clinical presentation of fever, malaise, adenopathy, and splenomegaly
is consistent with infectious mononucleosis, which is most often associated
with EBV, but can also be due to CMV or other viral infections. The absence
of cytopenias makes ALL unlikely. The lymphocytosis in CLL and pertussis
consists of mature small lymphocytes. Acute HIV infection can present similarly to mononucleosis, but does not typically cause massive splenomegaly.
59.2 C. Definitive diagnosis of CML is established by demonstrating the presence
of the Philadelphia chromosome or the underlying t(9;22) translocation, the
BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or mRNA fusion product, which is found in nearly
all patients. Toxic granulation and high LAP score are features of leukemoid
reaction. Splenomegaly is common in CML, but significant cytopenias are not
seen. Before imatinib and other TKIs, median survival in CML was 4 years
with progression to blast (acute leukemic) phase and death. Imatinib or other
TKIs are indicated as initial treatment for patients in chronic phase, with the
goals of achieving remission and preventing progression of disease.
59.3 A. The most likely diagnosis is autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA),
which can be confirmed by detection of antibody and/or complement components on the surface of the RBC, usually by the direct antiglobulin (Coombs)
test. AIHA is a common complication of CLL. ANA to screen for systemic
lupus erythematosus has a low probability in a woman of this age, without
other clinical features of SLE. Bone marrow biopsy to evaluate for bone marrow failure due to CLL could be considered, but rapid progression to stage III/
IV would be unlikely. Lewis alloantibodies have no clinical significance.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) and presence of basophilia are
seen in CML, and help distinguish it from leukemoid reaction (high LAP).



The BCR-ABL fusion gene found in the Philadelphia chromosome
t(9;22) produces a deregulated tyrosine kinase that is implicated in the
pathogenesis of CML, and is the target of therapy.



Acute leukemias present with symptoms due to symptomatic anemia,
bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, infection due to neutropenia, or with
hyperleukocytosis and symptoms of CNS or pulmonary microvascular
ischemia.



CLL/SLL is an indolent disease characterized by the monoclonal proliferation of mature B-lymphocytes expressing the CD5 antigen, and typically
presents as asymptomatic lymphocytosis or painless lymphadenopathy.



Complications of CLL include autoimmune hemolytic anemia or
thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections due to immune dysfunction,
or transformation to a more aggressive large cell lymphoma.

CASE 60
A 42-year-old Hispanic factory worker presents with complaints of dizziness. When
asked to describe what “dizzy” means to her, she relates a feeling of movement,
even though she is standing still. The first time it happened, she also felt a little
nauseated, but she did not vomit. Since then, she has not felt nauseated. In her
job, she has to look down to fold clothes coming off the line, and the dizziness
occurs if she looks down too quickly. It only lasts about a minute, but it is disruptive to her work. The symptom has also occurred when she is lying down and rolls
over in bed. She has no medical history or related family history. Her vital signs
and heart, lung, and gastrointestinal (GI) examinations are normal. Her pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are
intact, and no nystagmus is noted. Cranial nerve examination is normal. Strength,
deep tendon reflexes, and gait are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 60:
Dizziness/Benign Positional Vertigo
Summary: A previously healthy 42-year-old woman presents with intermittent
positional vertigo and a normal physical examination.
• Most likely diagnosis: Benign positional vertigo.
• Best treatment: A maneuver to dislodge the loose otolith from the affected
semicircular canal can be performed in the office, or medications such as
meclizine can be prescribed to treat the symptoms. For severe symptoms,
diazepam (Valium) or transdermal scopolamine patches can be prescribed.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand how to categorize types of dizziness.
2. Distinguish “benign” positional vertigo from more serious central causes of vertigo.
3. Recognize the symptoms and signs related to positional vertigo.
4. Understand the treatment options for vertigo.

Considerations
This previously healthy 42-year-old woman complains of acute onset of “dizziness,”
especially when moving her head quickly. Upon further questioning, the symptom of
vertigo is established, that is, the perception of movement when she is stationary.
She has no neurologic symptoms such as cranial nerve dysfunction, headache, or
history of head trauma. The normal neurologic examination similarly suggests a
benign process. The patient most likely has benign positional vertigo, which is the
most common cause of acute vertigo. The pathophysiology likely is debris in the
semicircular canals of the middle ear. Anticholinergic medications and positional
maneuvers are often useful in therapy.

VERTIGO: Illusory sensation of movement or spinning. Peripheral vertigo is
caused by the labyrinthine apparatus or vestibular nerve, whereas central vertigo is
caused by a brainstem or cerebellar process (Table 60–1).

CLINICAL APPROACH
The complaint of dizziness is one of the most common reasons for patients to seek
medical attention, and one of the most common reasons for the clinician to throw
up his or her hands in exasperation because of the vagueness of the complaint.
“Dizziness” is a word that can encompass a myriad of symptoms, including lightheadedness, vertigo, “feeling out of sorts,” and even gait instability. The first step
in evaluating patients with this complaint is to ask open-ended questions about
the sensation (“What do you mean by dizzy?”) and to listen to the patient’s history. Asking leading questions (“Did you feel like the room was spinning?”) can
cause one to go down the wrong diagnostic path. The majority of patients who
complain of dizziness are suffering from a distinctive symptom—presyncope,
dysequilibrium, or vertigo—which can be elucidated by history or physical
examination.
Presyncope is the sensation associated with near-fainting. Patients may describe
feeling lightheaded, a graying of vision, or “nearly blacking out.” This sensation
typically is brief, lasting seconds or minutes, and is self-resolving. The causes of this
symptom are the same as those for syncope: most often vasovagal attacks, orthostatic
hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmias. The evaluation of these patients is the same as
for those with syncope (see Case 15).
Dysequilibrium is a sense of imbalance, usually while walking. It is a multifactorial disorder, commonly seen in elderly patients with impaired vision, peripheral
neuropathy and decreased proprioception, and musculoskeletal problems causing gait
instability. It may also be one of the presenting symptoms of patients with primary
movement disorders such as parkinsonism. These symptoms may be exacerbated by
medications, particularly in the elderly; examples include antihypertensives, antidepressants, and anticholinergic agents that can cause orthostatic hypotension or
dizziness as a side effect.
Vertigo is the illusory sensation of movement or spinning, and usually arises
from a disorder in the vestibular system. Our spatial orientation system is composed

514

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

of three primary components. In the inner ear, the semicircular canals transduce
angular acceleration, while the otolith organs sense linear acceleration. These
systems send information through projections to the cerebellum, spinal cord, and
cerebral cortex, cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. The vestibular ocular reflex maintains
visual stability during head movements through these same cranial nerves, as well as
projections through the medial longitudinal fasciculus. This integration of the inner
ear, brain, and eyes explains why nystagmus is observed in patients during bouts of
vertigo. It is asymmetry or discordance between the vestibular inputs from the two
labyrinths or their central pathways that causes the sensation of vertigo. Physiologic
vertigo includes motion sickness, or the sensation of movement that may occur when
watching motion pictures.
Pathologic vertigo occurs when there are lesions in one of these systems. The
first task in evaluating a patient with vertigo is to try to distinguish peripheral
(labyrinthine apparatus or vestibular nerve) from central (brain stem or cerebellum)
causes of vertigo. Central causes, such as cerebellar hemorrhage or infarction, can
be immediately life-threatening or signify serious underlying disease and require
urgent investigation. Peripheral causes typically signify less serious diseases and
can be managed comfortably on an outpatient basis. Thus, the presence of other
neurologic abnormalities, headache, or evidence of increased intracranial pressure
is critical to address.
The most common type of vertigo seen is termed “benign” paroxysmal positional
vertigo (BPPV), although the symptoms can be far from benign. Typically, this
type of vertigo is precipitated by changes in head position, as in rolling over in bed,
bending over, or looking upward. Patients may not have all of the typical symptoms
at the same time; however, the first bout usually is abrupt in onset and associated
with nausea. Subsequent occurrences may be less severe. BPPV is thought to be
caused by loose, floating debris in the semicircular canals that causes an increase in
neurologic discharge from the vestibular system on that side.
Nystagmus during episodes of vertigo is characteristic of BPPV. To confirm the
diagnosis of BPPV in the office, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (Figure 60–1) can
be performed to elicit the nystagmus and vertigo. Patients turn their head toward
the examiner and lay down quickly with their head hanging somewhat lower than
the body. The eyes are kept open. The typical nystagmus is a mix of rotational
and vertical eye movements. There is a lag of 5 to 10 seconds for the nystagmus to
occur, and it is accompanied by the sensation of vertigo. A positive Dix-Hallpike
test, along with the absence of other otologic or neurologic findings, makes the
diagnosis of BPPV very likely.
BPPV is a self-limited disorder that may recur at some point in the patient’s future.
Anticholinergic agents, such as meclizine or diphenhydramine, or benzodiazepines
may help lessen symptoms. Alternatively one may attempt positional maneuvers in
the office to displace the otolith from the semicircular canal back into the utricle or
saccule, such as the Epley maneuver (Figure 60–2). Table 60–2 lists other causes of
vertigo and their associated clinical features.
Other causes of peripheral vertigo include Ménière disease and acoustic neuroma.
Ménière disease is due to idiopathic excess endolymphatic fluid. Patients may
experience episodes of vertigo lasting for minutes to hours, usually associated with

unilateral tinnitus, hearing loss, and ear fullness. They usually have low-frequency
sensorineural hearing loss on audiometry. Treatment includes antihistamines or
anticholinergics during acute attacks, and diuretics to reduce endolymphatic
fluid.
Acoustic neuromas are benign slow-growing tumors of Schwann cells. Because
they are slow-growing, the subtle imbalances in vestibular input are often compensated, and patients may not experience significant vertigo, only vague imbalance.
Presenting symptoms typically include unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. Treatment is usually surgical.
Finally, approximately 10% to 15% of patients have nonspecific dizziness,
which cannot be classified as vertigo, presyncope, or dysequilibrium. Patients cannot clearly describe one of these syndromes, can report only that they feel “dizzy,”
have vague or unusual sensations, and have normal neurologic and vestibular
examinations. The majority of these patients have some underlying psychiatric
disorder, such as major depression, generalized anxiety, or panic disorder. Often the
dizziness is associated with hyperventilation and can be reproduced in the office by
purposeful hyperventilation. Treatment should be aimed at reassurance regarding
the lack of pathologic causes of dizziness and at therapy for the underlying disorder
with medication such as serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors or benzodiazepines
for anxiety disorders.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
60.1 A young woman presents to your ofﬁce complaining of dizziness. When
asked to describe the feeling, she gives a vague story of just feeling like “her
head is too big.” The feeling is associated with palpitations, sweating, and
nervousness, and is almost constant. Her examination, including neurologic
evaluation, is completely normal. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan.
B. Obtaining a thorough psychosocial history.
C. Dix-Hallpike maneuver.
D. Prescribe meclizine.
E. Referral to neurology department.
60.2 A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency room with the sudden onset of
nausea and vomiting. His medical history is notable for coronary artery disease
and well-controlled hypertension. On examination he refuses to open his eyes
or move his head, but when ﬁnally coaxed to sit up, he immediately starts to
retch and vomit. Rotational nystagmus is noted. He cannot walk because of
the dizziness and nausea that walking evokes. His noncontrast brain CT scan
is read as normal for age. Which of the following is the best next step?
A. MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).
B. Obtain a thorough psychosocial history.
C. Dix-Hallpike maneuver.
D. Prescribe meclizine.
E. Referral to neurology.

518

CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE

60.3 A 65-year-old woman with a history of benign positional vertigo returns to
your ofﬁce for follow-up. Although manageable, the symptoms of vertigo continue to recur periodically. Between episodes she generally feels normal but
occasionally somewhat “off-balance.” Today, her neurologic examination is
completely normal, except that the thresholds of both air and bone conduction of a vibrating 256-Hz tuning fork are elevated on the left side. Which of
the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Intermittent benign positional vertigo
B. Otosclerosis
C. Acoustic neuroma
D. Acute basilar artery infarct
E. Panic disorder
60.4 Which of the following is the best next step for the patient described in
Question 60.3?
A. Prescription for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
B. Referral for a hearing aid
C. Lumbar puncture and serology for syphilis
D. Referral for an MRI
E. Reassurance

ANSWERS
60.1 B. This young woman is not describing vertigo. The word “dizzy” can mean
several different things, so it is extremely important when obtaining the history to have the patient describe, as best he or she can, what is meant by
“dizzy.” Patients with vertigo often use descriptors indicating movement, such
as “the room is moving around me” or “I’m on a roller coaster.” Feelings
of dysequilibrium, or “out-of-body” experiences such as this young woman
describes, are not typical of vertigo and indicate another problem. It would
be important to know what the symptoms are associated with; for example, is
there increased stress in her job or intimate relationship? Is this panic disorder
or anxiety disorder?
60.2 A. This patient has symptoms of central vertigo. The onset of symptoms was
abrupt and severe. His gait is affected. If he were able to cooperate with an
examination of his cerebellar functions, it would most likely be abnormal. His
age and history of hypertension and coronary artery disease place him at elevated risk for cerebellar infarction or hemorrhage. CT is not the appropriate
test for examining the brainstem; MRI is much more accurate. MRA may be
useful for delineating the exact vascular cause of the symptoms.

SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES

519

60.3 C. Acoustic neuromas are slow-growing tumors of the eighth cranial nerve.
Because of the slow growth of the tumor, the neurologic system often is able
to accommodate, so patients may have only subtle symptoms that at ﬁrst may
be confused with benign positional vertigo. The keys in this patient’s history
are the persistent low-grade feelings of dysequilibrium and the ﬁnding of
probable sensorineural hearing loss on the left side. This ﬁnding indicates a
possible problem with the eighth nerve, and an MRI would best delineate
the anatomy.
60.4 D. MRI is the diagnostic test of choice. See answer to Question 60.3.

CLINICAL PEARLS


Patients use the term “dizziness” to describe several sensations: vertigo,
presyncope, dysequilibrium, and nonspecific dizziness often associated
with psychiatric disorders.



Central causes of vertigo, such as cerebellar hemorrhage or infarction,
can be immediately life-threatening and require urgent investigation.



Peripheral causes of vertigo typically produce intermittent but severe
attacks of vertigo; they may have associated tinnitus or hearing loss but
should not be associated with other neurologic abnormalities.



Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common cause of
vertigo and can be diagnosed by the history of intermittent positional
symptoms, absence of other otologic or neurologic findings, and a positive
Dix-Hallpike test.



Benign positional vertigo can be treated with maneuvers to reposition
the abnormal otolith from the semicircular canal or by anticholinergic
medications such as meclizine.
